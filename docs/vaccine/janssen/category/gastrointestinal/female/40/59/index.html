                                                Dizzy, run down two hours after injection. Woke up 4 am then off and on with extreme body pain, sore neck , lower back, right hand and arm. Headache and fatigue at 6:45 am got up with two children (2 yrs and 10 months) ate small breakfast by 9 am I couldn?t get off the couch or stay awake. My head started aching and my eyes hurt, I felt extreme chills two thick blankets weren?t enough to warm me. Extreme fatigue, stomach pain and loss of appetite. I fell asleep and didnt have the energy to walk to my bed until 2:30 pm.  It set off my stomach and I was vomiting off and on until around 9 pm. By then I could keep little bits of fluid and food down. Then I was hot. I felt flushed but had no fever. My usual heart rate is 52-54 bpm via Watch while laying down. My heart rate during this hot period laying in bed was 102 -101 bpm. Which is consistent for my workout heart rate. I went to sleep and woke up 7 am with my kids and was well enough to take care of them but not do all my usual chores. I couldn?t bend down or put my head lower than chest or the extreme throbbing headache was back. Still had body aches and fatigue but nowhere near yesterday. It is 11:22 pm Sunday and I feel spent.

She had been waiting less than 10 minutes.  I went to her and she said she was feeling very strange and was nauseous. I tried to get her up but she couldn&#39;t walk so I let her sit back down. She was not able to communicate with me but was conscious. She said her vision was distorted. her lips started to turn blue and I continued to monitor her. I called 911 and she said she was having difficulty catching her breath so I went for the epipen and gave her 0.3 mg in the outer thigh of her right leg. her color started to improve and she was able to comunicate better. I followed EMS instructions and continued to monitor her until they arrived.

(I have migraines, but this pain was on the left side of my head, not my right like usual, and was even more intense than usual.)  I had chills and sweats, and body aches.  I checked several times and had no fever.  By the next morning (Saturday, March 13 at 7 am) I was feeling fine.

                                                Head ache and fever started the evening of March. Severe vertigo and nausea began sometime overnight or early the next morning. I was bed-ridden most of the day. I took zofran and ibuprofen. From then on the severe vertigo happened only while changing positions such as laying down and getting up. I saw a nurse practitioner on March 16th who told me it was due to ear wax. I received a prescription (meclizine) for the nausea and dizziness and bought an ear wax kit. The next a friend said her husband had the exact same symptoms as I was experiencing and that it was called facility. My husband assisted me with the epley maneuver twice on March 17th. By March 18th the vertigo was gone, with just slight dizziness during the day.

                                                Pregnancy: 15 weeks; anomaly in the placenta not yet clarified but could be accreta; due date September 6th 2021. The day after the shot, on Tuesday 3/23 at 7:30am, about 30 minutes after waking up, I felt nausea for a brief instant and immediately the need to vomit; I then had one episode of throwing up, pretty intense. After that I felt weak and cancelled my fitness class I was going to teach in the afternoon. I spent the rest of the day resting and taking care of myself because I felt exhausted.

                                                I felt light headedness right away. The night that I got the injection, I felt kind of drunk. I felt like I had too much alcohol. I am very sensitive to things. I felt silly - loose - tired.  In the night, I had aches and chills - no fever. The next day I felt achy and really really tired. I had a pain at the injection site. That evolved into a left side migraine (the achiness and fatigue and pain from shot) It created tension up my arm and up my neck - and I did get nausea with the headache - on Saturday. Sunday, I felt a little bit better but energy was still low - unusual tiredness; couldn&#39;t exercise as I felt a heavy fatigue. On Sunday, I went to a dance class but it was difficult as I was tired. On Monday, I felt a tiny bit better but still fatigued and did another dance class which went a little better. On Monday evening, I felt like I did the night of the injection - a little loopy and &#34;drunk like.&#34; Monday night, I woke up with a Fiery, achy, itchy, burning rash on both of my arms and the tops of my legs. If I would itch it, it would exaggerate it. When I woke up the next day - the rash went everywhere in my body - it would come and go in different places - neck, face, down and up my legs and feet and on my butt. Pretty much every spot had the rash at one time or another. It was really bad on Tuesday morning, I called the doctor. Was treated with Benadryl and cortisone cream which helped with the symptoms. Tuesday night, it was excruciating - it was all up and down my legs, arms, neck and face and stomach and rear end and feet. It was very achy, burning and itchy - very intense. It would hurt if I scratched it. Accompanied with really intense fatigue. Wednesday, after taking Benadryl, I woke up and it was a tiny bit better. It was still on my legs, neck and face. Sometimes my arms would flare up and sometimes they wouldn&#39;t. Any kind of exertion - like my dance class - would trigger the rash - so I took a break from exercising that week.  It started getting incrementally better - very slowly. Still there on Thursday - still fatigued and I was still taking Benadryl. Friday, also. Saturday, it was pretty much gone but it would threaten to come back and I felt itchiness in my legs when I went for a walk. It still feels a little lingering - my legs are itchy. I&#39;m still building back my energy. Incrementally my energy is increasing. Still not 100% there but it&#39;s getting better day by day.  Note: My history with my skin: I do get flare ups when I get bug bites and when I get poison ivy - I have very sensitive skin.

                                                4 hours post-vaccine, started to shiver 6 hours post-vaccine spiked fever of 102.2 7 hours post-vaccine developed headache and began to vomit 8 hours post-vaccine, I went to the ER They found I had tachycardia for the duration of my visit (11pm - 3 am). Administered Toradol and IV fluids, discharged me with good vitals, but still tachycardia, headache, and vomiting. The next day (3/20), I still had a bad headache and could  not keep liquids down. I vomited perhaps 12 times, then called the doctor. She sent me to Urgent Care to receive injections of Toradol and Phenergan. Within the hour, I  could drink. Then shortly after, I  could eat. I  felt better for one day. The next day (3/22), my heart started pounding, and I was unable to sleep horizontally. I  needed to sleep on 3 pillows due to chest discomfort. My chest still feels very uncomfortable. Abdominal breathing is helping to an extent. I have had to stay in bed and greatly reduce my activities since receiving the vaccine.  Today is one week, and I am still in bed.

I also move my arm around a lot after the injection to keep it from hurting. I drove home, at lunch and about 2:45 was hit with a very noticeable headache. I never get headaches and eat healthy and consume about a gallon of water a day. I knew it wasn&#39;t from dehydration or being hungry.  Headache was in the temple area and made my eyes hurt in the same way they would if you had cried for an extended period of time or were overtired. At 3pm a wave of exhaustion hit me. I was sitting working trying to combat the headache and felt almost wiped out. I got through the rest of my work day (4:30) and went to lay down immediately. I passed out almost instantly until 7 pm. I work up and showered, ate dinner and started to feel a little warm. It should be noted it was an unseasonably warm day and got up to 77, so it was a tiny bit warm in my home. I put on loose fitting clothes and slayed on the couch still with the bad headache and the injection site started to throb so I placed and ice pack on for 20 minutes. I could only stay awake until 8:45 and got in bed. I could not get comfortable for several hours feeling very warm. I tried a fan on high and drinking more water but i felt very warm like how you feel with the flu. I took my temp at 1130pm it was normal. I continued to toss and turn and feel very warm and slightly dizzy, in the sense that I hadn&#39;t been able to sleep and with the headache my body was just exhausted. Around 2 am i woke up for more water and got in the shower because I had sweated so much my sheets were wet and my clothes. I got out of the shower around 10 minutes later, changed and got new sheets and got back in bad. Around 330 I felt very hot again and opened the windows and got another ice pack for my arm which was throbbing again. I finally fell asleep after 3:45am. I got up for work at 6am. I felt slightly foggy, and very hot. But no fever. My temp is normally around 97.4-97.9 and it was 98.4. Still normal but I was running warmer than usual. It took a long time to get ready and despite hot water in the shower I was freezing. i got dress and debated going to work. Got in the car at 6:45 and my drive to work is 30 minutes. 1/2 way into my drive I got very sweaty again and went home to change my clothes because they were too warm. Got to work around 7:20 and still felt warm but they take our temps at the door and min was still okay, no fever. I drank a lot of water and ate, and at 8:30 am all of a sudden the exhaustion was gone and I felt normal. I got home form work at 5:30p and took a 3 hour nap and felt normal again.

                                                Immediately following the vaccine administering I stood up and felt very sick and nauseated. I began to sit down again and was brought water. I tried to drink some water and my husband and I tried to walk to the tent for observation. I fell down and fainted. I was wheeled in a wheelchair to the ER and vital sign and blood sugar and EKG were performed. I declined being admitted to the hospital for further investigation.

Within an hour began to feel like I had taken a sedative (reminded me of how klonopin made me feel when I was taking it for anxiety).  Sedative type feeling lasted for approximately 4 hours.  Headache developed approximately 2 hours after receiving vaccination.  Headache and nausea persisted until bedtime.  Had major issues sleeping and had night sweats all night.  Nausea is gone this morning but headache is still present.  Some mild tenderness at injection site that is still present this morning.

(Not normal )  This lasted two days.  Intense chills/shivering. Night sweats, nausea.  This was the night of the injection.  Headache. Everyday since  injection.  Throbbing in left temple.   Muscular pain, left deltoid. This has increased since day of injection.   Redness, swelling, pain  at injection site that has intensified since injection. (No other indicators of it being an infection. Not warm to touch, no oozing or bleeding or any type of fluid.)   Left  forearm  muscle pain, left wrist pain- almost like a dull ache going down arm.

The next morning  15 hours after vaccine my arm started to hurt so badly I could barely move. The nerves in the injected arm running up and down with shooting and  pulsing, lack of feeling in hands and extreme pain through the the arm and shoulder on the injected side.  The pain was extreme for 13 days I lost work time. I saw several doctors who sent me on my way. My arm still hurts right now 24 days since vaccine. The pain is not extreme but the nerves still shoot pain and oils and there is often extreme pain by the end of the day.

                                                Had a sore arm within hour of shot (got it at 7:30pm). Felt a little yucky before going to bed. I made sure to hydrate significantly before the shot and after. I woke up at 3am with chills and had them for about an hour.  Woke up the next morning at 9am with with medium neck and head pain and feeling a little chilly and out of it. Mild ache in joints and body overall. At 10am I took one ibuprofen, but at 11am (200mg), kept pushing fluids. 11am headache got worse temp 98.7 (slightly high for me, I am usually about 97). Started having some gastrointestinal issues around noon. Felt nausea and sweaty palms loss of appetite. Had a bowel movement (normal in appearance).    That all seemed to pass and I felt better, still tired, for most of the afternoon. Arm was sore to the touch and when moving. I managed to eat a few small meals, kept up hydration, and took a nap late in the day. I woke up at 5pm with headache and body aches all over. No appetite again. Had very little to eat, kept hydrating,    At 7pm my vision got a little blurry and I had a minor vasovagal episode. Center of vision blurred, got chills and sweaty, nausea, and I had to poop  (it was less formed). I rested, cool compress, and raised my feet. It all passed in about 20 minutes. I had major loss of appetite rest of the night (couldn&#39;t eat anything), kept hydrating, and went to bed.  Slept through the night with no incidents.   Woke up at 9am second day and had a small breakfast, though my appetite is still not back. Generally feeling exhausted, but no headache or aches in the body anymore. My arm is still sore. Had some more GI distress (another less formed poop around 11am).   My appetite returned by early afternoon on the 2nd day post-vaccine. Still tired and generally feeling &#34;off,&#34; especially mentally. Had brain fog all afternoon and my ears felt plugged today. Hard to concentrate on a task.

I spent the rest of the day and the next day sleeping or laying in bed. By the 3rd day, I was less nauseous at night and was able to eat some dry Cheerios. The 4th day, I became nauseous and dry heaving again, sleep until the early evening. By the 5th day I was a little better that I could work from home. Did not feel completely like myself until the following Tuesday.

My vision got blurry, I started feeling nauseous, shivers, cold sweats, body felt shaky, and at first I thought I had been drugged. This &#34;attack&#34; lasted for a couple of minutes. After being able to get home I was in bed until 4 pm the next day. At first I had several hours where I was freezing despite being in bed fully dressed with the heat blasting, the following hours, I was sweating. I had a headache, felt nauseous, and uncomfortable all day Saturday. My reaction to the vaccine was much worse than having Covid-19. Missed work due to the symptoms from getting the vaccone.

I felt clear headed but exhausted for the rest of the day.  My chest has been tight and congested since then. Hard to breath and my voice is rough and raspy. This is ongoing and I still have chest tightness and a raspy voice.  On 4/12/21 I started having horrible joint and muscle aches again throughout my body and felt so tired. Horrible headache and stomach pain, bloating and nausea.

                                                On April 8th at 4am, I woke up feeling a strong pain in my heart / esophagus region. I was alone and out of town and didn&#39;t know what to do, so I just sat in the hotel bed and waited for morning to come. I didn&#39;t know if i was having a heart attack or if it was gas from drinking soda the previous day. I went to work. At work, the left side of my tongue suddenly started swelling and a tingling and numbness set in my upper lip. I was very scared, rushed to the drugstore and bought GasX, Ricola drops (my throat was slightly sore, too) and Allegra 24 hours. I immediately took the Allegra pill but still went to the hospital. When getting to the parking of the hospital, though, the anti-allergic started kicking in and the tongue started getting back to normal, so I went back to work and didn&#39;t enter the hospital. I was ok for a while. Hours later, rashes started showing all over my body. Starting in my arms then under my breasts. On the night of the 8th, I even had fever and chills. Still, I had to go to work so it was a real nightmare. I also had diarreah. I then went to the drugstore again and also bought regular and night Advil, lots of water and electrolytes drink, Peptobismol and Benadryl (only Allegra was not enough). The following day, April 9th, the rashes started spreading all over my body, the fever was only being controlled by Advil. I flew back to Miami and was bedridden until the April the 11th. On the night of April the 11th I still woke up with very strong headache and on the 12th spent the day with a headache, but since have gotten better.

                                                Chills/shaking began approximately 8 hours after injection.  Other symptoms of an achy upper body, temperature of 103.1, and nausea came shortly after initial symptoms (within 1 hr.).    In the middle of the night, I began heavily sweating (something I have never experienced).  I was drenched with sweat and needed to change in the middle of the night.   Absolutely no energy and a horrible headache.    24 hrs. after the injection I no longer had a high fever.  However, consistently for a week, every day, I had at least one symptom (headache, nausea, chills, or lack of energy) at some point throughout the day.  When I received the injection, I was on day 2 of my period.  It ended one day later than normal.  However, what was not normal was that on 4/3/21, I began to bleed again.  I passed 2 clots and had spotting for an additional 5 days.  This is in no way normal to my cycle.

Experienced blackout segments. Took 1 dose of 100mg Sumatriptan at about 930pm and tried to sleep w/the immense pain. Took 2nd dose at about 12am. Pain did not dissipate but fell asleep. When i woke up pain was gone but felt very sore, dizzy and disoriented. Fast forward to April 9th while laughing uncontrollably the right side of my face spasmed/cramped  closing my right eye and contracting my right cheek as if having Bell&#39;s Palsy. I have never experienced this before. Face did not continue to droop but has left a tick/twitch sensation under my right eye.

About 30 hours later I started to experience extreme leg pain/tremors, severe nausea and an unrelenting headache, lower back pain and continued chills. 6 days after receiving the vaccine (3/15/21) I tested positive for Covid-19 and the symptoms worsened. 8 days after receiving the vaccine I developed a cough and sore throat and trouble breathing. 10 days after receiving the vaccine I went to the emergency room (3/19/21) and received a chest x-ray and diagnosed with covid pneumonia and given antibiotics to treat along with a CT scan. Symptoms started to subside about 2 weeks after receiving the vaccine, although to this day I am still troubled with a lingering headache and constant fatigue. Throughout the duration I relied on Tylenol and Motrin. At the hospital I was prescribed indomethacin and ondansetron for pain and nausea.

                                                One day after vaccine I missed worked, was in bed all day with fever of 101.8, headache, body aches, abdominal pain etc.  On 4.2, I couldn?t breathe after attempting a lower-than-normal intensity elliptical workout (I do 60&#43; min elliptical workouts 5x/week and 6&#43; mile walks the other 2 days/week). Following that event I had significant trouble getting a full breath and had dull upper left back pain and very localized pain in upper left abdominal area/lower left rib area that got worse at night. I had a telemedicine appointment with my pcp on 4.14, was Rx?d advair and albuterol. Had another telemedicine with my pcp on 4.16 because breathing and localized pain were more concerning. PCP sent me to the ER. At the hospital ER they found elevated troponin-I and an abnormal ekg (normal chest X-ray and cat scan) and diagnosed me with an NSTEMI heart attack. They transferred me the other hospital where they did more testing.  Troponin-t was normal, ekg was determined to be a normal atypical variant. I completed an exercise stress test and the cardiologist determined that I would not have been able to complete the full 15 min with no abnormalities if I?d just had an NSTEMI so they changed the diagnosis to Acute Myocardial Injury.  On 4.23 lab results showed troponin-I is still elevated.  I still cannot Get a full breath and still have some left back and lower rib pain

                                                Had a few cocktails and I blacked out, was highly sensitive to the alcohol. I was throwing up for two hours. I couldn?t move. I couldn?t stop the overwhelming need to vomit. I would try and lay down and was in pain. I ended up telling my partner to call an ambulance after two hours of being in such pain. We were across the street from a hospital so we drove. I was given fluid and blood work was done. I left before receiving the results. I couldn?t stand another minute lying there freezing. The machine that was monitoring me kept beeping quickly. I was able to get home and I slept for 12 hours and woke up feeling achy and was having hot flashes for a few hours.

I had some weird stomach pain (kind of sharp, nerve pain) that was on my right side. It felt sudden and it startled me. It ended up going away - that happened four or five times the first day. The next day, I woke up with migraine headache - told doctor experienced nausea, vomiting, sweating.  That migraine lasted three or four days. I was taking Imitrex (I take it as needed - 2 a day) and that was not helping. It was a horrible headache. I saw the PCP and the rheumatologist and they did a nerve block which helped. The nerve block was about a month ago. And that worked for about a month but now I&#39;m having migraines again. I am still having a lot of the nerve pain. The doctor said that I have pre-anti-fossid lipid - syndrome (APS) - and was concerned about clots.

I felt better for about 30 minutes after vomiting, but I started vomiting again. I started to have blinding pain in my head. By 6pm, I was having muscle and joint pain so I went to the ER. I tested negative for COVID. I received some IV drugs, but I&#39;m not sure of the name. I was also tested for Lyme disease, but I never received the results. Nothing was confirmed about my adverse event, but it was guessed that I was experiencing migraines. I also received IV fluids. Around midnight I felt better and was released from the ER.

Called doctor, who instructed us to go to ER for IV steroids and additional care.

She wakes up at 5:00 AM in the morning for work and on Friday she could not put her feet on the ground for pain in her legs.  She also had a bad headache on the left side and took Advil for that, and then the headache switched to the right side.  She then took another Advil, and that was all she took that day and was that way the whole weekend.  She had pain all weekend and could not touch herself as the pain was so bad.  She also had chills, nauseated, her vision was going in and out as if she was at the eye doctors office.  Her uncle brought her mother over to her as she could not take care of herself or drive to take care of her cousin who she takes care of.  She went to go work on Monday 3/26/21  then she started having difficulty breathing  and her employer called the EMT&#39;s, they checked her heart rate which was high and did her oxygen level which was fine, and were afraid she may have gone into cardiac arrest, and told her to rest.  She called her doctor who told her that it was a bad reaction to the vaccine.   She is still having difficulty breathing after walking so far, she weighs 115# and has always been a small person.  She was not given any medications by her doctor and told her to rest and if it worsened to call her back.    She had been seen two weeks prior by her doctor for a sinus infection and was given an allergy shot and some other injection of which she does not know what it was, possibly a steroid.

I immediately got to her, felt her pulse and she was breathing so I lifted her legs. She immediately came to. We gave her ice packs and sat with her until she was able to move on her own accord. She was light headed and nauseated and had a friend take her home.

Paramedics arrived within 1 minute. After examination, patient was transported to hospital at 1:30p.m. accompanied by family members. At 3:55p.m.,  I spoke to her fiancé to inquire about her well being. She was still at ER at 3:55 p.m. She was given Benadryl, EpiPen, and Prednisone. Fiancé said she was breathing better but there was a rash and itching at injection site which was being treated with Benadryl and Prednisone. Fiancé said patient was frustrated at having to be at emergency room.

                                                I experienced slight nausea, awake all night, felt like a stimulant to me, fever, chills, sweating, migraines. I felt super tired but my body would not let me sleep. I also had muscle aches and cramps with lower back and leg with a throbbing sensation. This was within 12 hours. About 5 days later, my eye started to hurt, went to se my eye doctor and they found out I have ocular herpes. I am on now on some antiviral eye medication. I could tell after the vaccine I had a viral type infection. I still have not recovered and I will see my eye doctor tomorrow.

I experienced strong fatigue over the next couple of days, including sleeping 11 hours on 4/9.   I am still tired today, 4/10.  *Dizziness:  Late in the evening, I was very dizzy for a couple of minutes.  My head felt strange on and off throughout the night. Maybe lightheaded and definitely strange.   *Not able to complete normal daily activities because of:  Nausea, chills and hot spells: These 3 were experienced starting around 11pm.  Each symptom would come and go in waves.   I was miserable and could not sleep for very long.  I took lots of naps the next day.  Also, I was unusually forgetful.  These 3 symptoms (chills, nausea, hot spells), along with the fatigue, were so strong that I was unable to do most of my daily activities on 4/8.   I felt only about 50% functional on 4/9 and I&#39;m mostly OK today.       *Fever: none *Heart rate:  frequently elevated about 20 beats per minute from my baseline

                                                On 4-8-21 at approx 2:30am I woke up with chills, nausea and severe diarrhea. I began experiencing severe abdominal pain in belly button as if it were on fire. Hurt to take deep breaths. Developed hives all over body and very itchy. Scheduled phone call with triage nurse at 11:15am and then a follow up call again with my primary care doctor immediately following. At approx 1:22pm my primary care doctor told me to go to urgent care or ER due to concern of me going into anaphylactic shock. Immediately went to Emergency Room and admitted after waiting in waiting room for over 5 hrs. After bloodwork and CT Scan of abdomen my appendix was perforated and needed to be removed immediately. Immediately sent to OR for surgery at 11pm.

                                                P/C from patient. States she took the vaccine on 4/1/21 @ 1:30 PM. When she heard of the issues that were in the news about the vaccine she thought she should call.  4/1/21 Thursday: That evening around 6 PM she started to have a rash. It started on her L arm where she got her vaccination traveled up her neck, covered her face and trunk. It started out as an itchy red rash but became raised hives. It resolved on it&#39;s own and on Saturday she did not have the rash anymore. Never had any difficulty with breathing. Her left arm where she received her vaccination still has some discoloration. States on Thursday evening she started having a &#34;brain fog&#34;.   4/2/21 Friday: The next morning she woke up and was unable to finish a sentence, states she was confused, &#34;felt like I was on pain medication, like I was drugged&#34;. States she was confused, could not think and could not remember anything. Cried all day over nothing. Would tell her daughter something and then immediately ask what did I just say as she couldn&#39;t remember what she said. She was working on the graduation hooding ceremony and scribbled all over her papers like a 3 year old and the papers were strewn all over the floor. She reports that she had a mild headache all over her head dull pain and pressure 4/10. Took tylenol but that didn&#39;t help at all. Denies having any visual problems, trouble breathing or chest pain. Did have some abdominal dull cramping with nausea and even though it felt like she was going to have diarrhea there was no diarrhea or vomiting . The abdominal pain went away after friday but the nausea stayed through Sunday.She states she got lightheaded if she stood up too fast or turned her head too fast. This just happened on Friday. Denies having any weakness, lack of coordination, or speech issues. She states she was crying and could not stop all day on Friday. She told her boss she was having a mental breakdown and had to go home.  4/3/21 Saturday: Patient states she felt stupid, could not think, could not remember anything she said. States that the horrible headache came on Saturday. It was so bad she had to lay down in a dark room with a wet washcloth over her eyes. The horrible headache.lasted about 1 hour at a 10/10 level. Took some more tylenol but does not think it helped. Went to sleep and when she woke up the headache was still there at a rete of 4/10. She was still nauseate but the crying had resolved.  4/4/21 Sunday: Again, had a  severe migraine when she woke up. 7/10, not as bad as the one on Saturday. It lasted a couple of hours and then went back to the 4/10 headache that has persisted at the 3-4/10 level the entire time since she got her vaccination. The headache never stops hurting and stays 3-4/10.   4/5/21 Monday: Had a regular headache 3-4/10. Still felt &#34;loopy&#34; and with brain fog.  Went to work on Monday and told her boss about it and that she still says she can&#39;t think straight. Her boss has been very supportive and has helped her to complete her assignments to get them in on time.   4/6/21 Tuesday: Still had a  headache, It has been continuous ever since Friday. Still taking Tylenol and it doesn&#39;t seem to help. Yesterday she even tried Ibuprofen and it didn&#39;t help.   4/13/21 Today is day 13 and she still can&#39;t think straight. still has 3-4/10 headache, still all over her head. Feels that she still has brain fog, but not as &#34;loopy&#34;. Feels like she can remember what she has said better.   She called the nurse line at her husband&#39;s work.They told her that it was just a reaction to the vaccine. The patient didn&#39;t think to report it to the Health Center.  She got the vaccine from the Health Center (she asked if employees could get the vaccine and said she would prefer that)  She is not pregnant.  She has no chronic health conditions and takes no medications routinely  She denies being allergic to any medications and states she has taken the Flu shot without any reaction in the past.  NOTE: Tested positive for COVID on 2/4/21 and was told it was OK to get the vaccine. She lost her taste and smell and said she felt she had a mild flu for a couple of days. Has regained her sense of taste and smell and has had no residual symptoms.   Instructed patient to go to the ER for an exam. She needs a full neuro exam and at least a C_T scan of the head. She would like to contact her Primary Care Provider. States she hasn&#39;t seen him for a couple of years but feels like he would want to know. Instructed patient to call me with the outcome of her visit to her PCP or the ER. Patient verbalized understanding of and agreement with plan.

Everything but the soreness of the injection site and tightness in the muscles on that side lasted about 48  hours.

Internal rotation, weakness in left ankle. It happened again as I walked shortly after. That day I tripped many times due to weakness in that ankle. When I showered and shaved my legs I realized that I had absolutely no feeling in the left lateral part of my lower leg. It felt like I had a novocaine injection in my leg. I could not even feel a pin prick there. By Friday 4/9/2021 I started to have some sensation, but still decreased sensation and weakness in my left ankle even at this moment.  ****4 WEEKS AFTER THE SHOT**** My period started Monday, April 5th, 2 days early. By Friday, 4/9/2021 and through the day and night Saturday 4/10/2021, I had such a heavy period that I kept soaking through tampons, pads, and 2 pairs of jeans. I have never blead like that and could not keep up.

                                                With prior vaccines and flu shots, I have either had no side effects or mild.  But with the COVID vaccine, I was sicker than sick!  I wasn&#39;t expecting to miss as much work as I did, nor go to the doctor three times in a week&#39;s time.  I received it around 11:30am on Thursday, March 18.  Around 1pm, my mild headache started to intensify and had ringing in my ears that would repeatedly come and go (still is doing so today, just not as frequent).  Around 4pm is when all of the &#34;normal&#34; side effects started?chills, hot flashes, sore arm, and super sleepy.  I woke up a couple hours later, with a headache that was WAY worse and was super nauseous.   This was close to 10pm.  Then, around 11pm that same night, I developed HORRID shooting ear pains and took my first Tylenol.  The ear/jaw pain was more than I could stand - had it in both ears, but the right ear was more intense.  It felt like I had a lighting rod between both ears and had these intense &#34;zings&#34; that kept going back and forth, like they were playing ping-pong.  The painful &#34;zings&#34; reminded me of those felt during an ear infection but WAY MORE INTENSE.  My jaw was super tight, as well, with a horribly intense headache.  I spent the entire night night doing warm compresses on my ears, taking Tylenol every 4-6 hours, staying in the shower, and lots of crying.  It was so bad that I felt the need to go to the ER but didn&#39;t feel comfortable driving and didn&#39;t want to go the ambulance route?and thought it was pointless because going to the ER for ear pain would leave me there for hours and hours since I didn&#39;t feel it would be viewed an an urgent emergency.  My goal was to make it through the night and see if I could get into my PCP doctor the following morning.  I took another Tylenol around 5am, and I thankfully cried myself to sleep for a couple of hours.  When I woke up, I called my PCP but couldn&#39;t get in, so I did an online doctor visit through my insurance company.  My fever was about 103.06 at its highest during the night but was gone by 3:34pm Friday afternoon (assuming because I was taking more Tylenol than I had been post-online doctor&#39;s appointment).  Around 7pm Friday evening, I knew I needed to go to the ER or urgent care.  I got a ride and was taken to urgent care for my intense ear pain.  They gave me a Toradol injection and Tramadol prescription.  By bedtime Friday night, the injection was doing its job and made the ear pain and zings were much less intense (didn&#39;t get the prescription until a couple days later).  On March 20, Saturday night, is when I developed a red, itchy rash on my back and tummy.  Over the next couple of days, it was on my chest, arms, legs?pretty much come and was in various places.  I called my PCP Monday morning (March 22), left a message, and they called me back to tell me to restart taking my Zyrtec/HCL to see if it would help the itching.  It has and am just mildly breaking out at this time.  The stinkin&#39; ear/jaw pain returned on Tuesday the 23rd, so I loaded up on OTC ear drops and made an appointment with my PCP for Wednesday, March 24.  She saw no ear infection and essentially told me to keep taking the pain meds.  I received the vaccine on March 18 and did not return to work until the following Thursday.  In retrospect, I should have just missed the remainder of that week, too.

I had severe chills (it felt like my muscles were all contracting as I lay in the fetal position trying to stay warm). Over the course of about 12 hours (starting with the onset of the fever) I experienced nausea, vomiting, headache, cough and elevated heart rate. According to my apple watch my heart rate hit 140 at points. It was over a 100 for quite some time. My resting heart rate is usually in the 70s. The worst of my symptoms were experienced for 12-14 hours from the onset of the fever (5:30 PM 4/10/21 - 7:00AM 4/11/21.  4/11/21 7:00am - the rest of 4/11/21 i experienced fatigue, headache (though less severe) and had no appetite. I vomiting a couple more times early in the day, and had trouble keeping water down unless it was a sip at a time. Mild body aches. Fever hovered at 99-100 most of the day.  elevated resting heart rate  4/12/21 mostly symptom free but for fatigue and elevated heart rate  As of today, 4/13/21, I am still experiencing  a slightly elevated resting heart, mid 80&#39;s.

My throat starts to swell, it?s hard to swallow. I start coughing profusely.  Later that evening came the chills, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea. That lasted 3 days. On day 8 I had severe pain down my arm. The same as the pain I had before I had my cervical spine fusion. On day 11 I had severe down my leg. Again the same type of pain I had before having lumbar spine surgery.  I?m on day 12 as I?m writing this.

                                                The first two days I had a normal reaction with fatigue and soreness.  On the second night I developed a severe sinus issue that caused my tongue to turn white/gray and be dry and sore.  Frequent diarrhea, headache, sore throat, soreness, low grade fever for half a day and a resulting acid reflux condition. (I have never had acid reflux before) I was tested for Covid and Strep, both negative. Continued lymph node sensitivity for two weeks.  3.5 weeks in, I developed muscle tension, unrelenting, from the back of my head all the way down my spine. I had continued chest pressure and some numbness on my left side in my arm, leg and later my face. No home remedies worked and rarely do I get back/neck/shoulder pain. I was not doing anything strenuous. I went to the ER where they tested me for blood clots (J&amp;J news had just come out and I have a family history) and prescribed valium for the muscle tension which has somewhat helped.   I fully recognize that this might be bad luck, a series of unfortunate events after I received my shot.  However, I have not been sick all year, I have never had acid reflux issues or pain like this in my neck/back/shoulders previously.  The fact that in the 4 weeks after the shot I have not had a single day where I felt normal is a red flag to me. I feel like it is worth reporting in case anyone else has had a similar experience.

Period cycle started early and was very intense cramps, heavy bleeding, vomiting. To date, the headache, dizziness, light headed, brain fog and fatigue are still being experienced 13 days after being vaccinated. I called a nurse line on 4/16/2021 to talk over my side effects and was told to visit an urgent care center, who then sent me to the ER for bloodwork and an MRI of the brain. Was told all results came back normal, to continue to monitor myself and make an appointment with a primary care physician if I feel the same in week.

Went to primary who detected a drop in oxygen levels, was then sent to ER where many tests were done.  Included chest scan, to look for clots.  None were found.   Took dramamin for vertigo which helped.  Symptoms of nausea, headache, vertigo continue to persist off and on.  On Friday 4/23 I died my hair.  Within 2 minutes an allergic reaction too place: sudden nausea, some shaking, headache.  Took benedryl which help.  At this point, I have continued bouts of nausea and no appetite.  Its been close to a month and I&#39;m really scared for my health.  I was completely healthy before.

                                                As soon as I took the vaccine shot I had an immediate headache, after taking the vaccine I took Tylenol and slept in the rest of the day. The next day I woke up and my arm was red and swollen. I was running fever, still had the headache and now blurry vision. My entire body was hurting. My left side of my body felt numb and tingling. The next two days the pain became worse. I did not really have an appetite. When I did eat I could barely hold my food down. On Wednesday morning I could barely get out of bed, I also felt extreme pain in my lower legs, stabbing pain in stomach and right lower side. I also had ringing in my ears, more in the right ear. I then notice a bruise on my left leg, that it was not originally there, and was also tender to touch. I went to the emergency room on the same day and I was admitted. I was in there for 4 days, they tested my leg and stated it was not a blood clot, although it look and felt like one. They discharge me and advise me that it was a migraine that was causing all my pain.  This was on Sunday, I had a follow up with my PCP on the Friday, however to being in so much pain and shortness of breath, and arm pain I was advise to go to the ER on the Thursday and was admitted again. I was told in the ER I had a blood clot in my right arm and it was most likely from the IV from the previous visit. My blood pressure and heart rate was so high that they put me on medication. No matter the pain medication they gave me, it would not completely take the pain away. They discharge me again on Monday and after me begging them to get run any and all test, they said they found nothing. I&#39;m still in the same amount of pain and same symptoms, still having trouble keeping my food down. The only thing that changed is my left arm is not as sore, however I still have a huge knot and its still warm to touch. I don&#39;t know what else to do that is why im contacting the CDC for help. I&#39;m in a extreme amount of pain and pounding headaches.  Please help

Approximately 7 hours after the injection (6:45pm), physical exhaustion set in; mental state was wide awake (thinking about everything/mind racing), however. Approximately 1 hour after the exhaustion began, slight fever and chills started.  By 9 pm the fever and chills increased to the point of teeth chattering and touch to the body felt raw.  Throughout the night, the fever and chills continued.  Sleep was mixed with pain in the legs and restlessness, coupled with a mild headache.  In the morning, the headache increased, but the chills subsided and the fever had broken (8am); slight nausea.  Eating food seemed to keep the nausea at bay; body exhaustion still existed.  headache subsided by the evening. no further chills/fever symptoms.  1.5 days for major adverse symptoms.  Soreness at injection is still continuing (no discoloration or lump, just soreness).  no vomiting, diarrhea, migraine  perhaps related, but not sure...my right leg had a broken fibula a month prior, but was ~98% healed.  The evening of the injection, that ankle was swollen to the size when the injury first occurred.  Earlier that day, the ankle had no visible signs of injury (no swelling, discoloration, etc).  In the morning, the ankle appeared as it had the day/week before.

She was able to communicate the entire time and I had an associate monitor her and be with her the entire time. She had a few sips of water and felt better. After about 20 minutes she felt better.  The associate was with her for 30 minutes and she felt better and continued to shop on and stopped by before she left the premises.

                                                The morning after I received the vaccine, I started having chest pressure and acid reflux. There was a hard pressure in my chest and my heart was beating weird. I started to develop a headache. I had low blood pressure a couple days later. I went to the clinic and they said I may have a blood clot. I also went to Hospital and they took some blood and did an X-ray and they told me I was fine. I was told that it may be anxiety or stress. The chest pain started to go away, but now my teeth are hurting and are sensitive. I feel that the adverse event lasted for three weeks.

                                                Within 2 mins of receiving injection, I experienced full body sweats, deadening of sound, blackness in eyes, lightheaded, unable to hold things in my hands, uneasy stomach, very pale all over, especially face. Talked/deep breathed my way out of fainting. Within 10 minutes all the above symptoms started to lessen. 15 minutes after receiving the injection, the near fainting experience was over and I was comfortable leaving and driving. But the 10 minutes were terrible and I came very close to passing out. My husband experienced the exact same symptoms 2 days later. I will be reporting that immediately following this submission.

I wanted to vomit but nothing would come out. After that the headache is very very bad. The situation continued until Sunday around 07:00 pm and then I was better. After that, my hip pain and back pain and headache was still very bad. I went to my family doctor and they gave me to some medicine to help. They gave me a lotion to put on my hip to stop pain, and I had more rest. I am still getting the hip pain and back pain and the headache. Sometimes, I feel much better but sometimes when I feel tired my headache starts again. The headaches are only on the right side of my head.

Prednisone worked after a few days but was still run down and pain developed in my abdomen and along the right side of back/leg.  Went to ER on 5/24.21.  Doctors performed tests for blood clots.  Was told I was weak and dehydrated and given IV and pain meds. Was negative for blood clots but my IVC was dilated. Pains persisted for about 2 weeks - especially in the right abdomen.  Went to cardiologist on 6/4/21 and had a normal EKG but low BP.  Doctor believes abdominal pain is gastrointestinal and put me on proton pump inhibitor.  I am getting echocardiogram on 6/10./21 to check IVC.  Since then most pains have subsided except weak, right sided abdominal pain.  The right ear pain is back.  Starts in the morning with outer cartilage of ear getting inflamed, followed by pressure/pain in right ear, then pain in right neck.  Has been going on for a month now.  100% related to vaccine - came after vaccination and never had before.

                                                About ten minutes after leaving the vaccination site, I began feeling a strange dizziness; an internal wobbly-Jello-like sensation. I felt a pin/needle/ stabbing sensation on my left fingers, particularly on the dorsal side of the third and fourth fingers, and in the middle of the tongue. The tongue felt as if was receiving a subtle electric charge that immobilized it with every shock. It lasted about 5 minutes. My vision was blurry. After that, my mind was foggy.  At about midnight, flu-like symptoms began sudden, but they were the expected symptoms for a covid vaccine (fever, body aches, sweats, sore throat, severe headache, pain on injection site, etc.) However, the pin/needle/ stabbing sensation was felt throughout the body. It sometimes felt as if a bubble, waves, or something was moving inside of me, in different areas of the body (rib cage, legs, chest, arms, legs, face, and top of the head (like when a baby moves inside of a pregnant woman, without the visible bump). My body, head, and neck felt stiff.  Symptoms were milder after 48 hours, on and off, until 4/13/2021 when I felt a sunken feeling, like something dropped inside of me (sugar, blood pressure, blood rush, I do not know). The tense feeling of the body returned. I felt dizzy. Left arm and leg felt tingly. There were palpitations, but I think that it was due to being scared about all the other symptoms. I felt cold and was shivering. The head felt stiff again. I was very thirsty. In the following days, symptoms got milder. On 4/22/2021, at about 4pm, the sunken feeling returned, along with the dizziness, wave or bubble-like sensation through head, face, body. The wave-like sensation flashed across my face, head, and neck intermittently. It was hard to speak, pronounce words, and swallow. The tongue felt numb. It lasted about two hours. I felt exhausted, so I took a nap until 8pm. When I woke up, I felt like nothing had happened, no symptoms until 1:00 am.  At 1:00 pm, 4/23/2021, the sunken feeling, dizziness, palpitations, heavy breathing without shortness of breath, cold/shiver, blurred vision, the wave-like sensation, and pokes suddenly returned. The waves were more intense and felt like pressure on the right side of the head and left side of the chest. Went to the Emergency Room. With every wave of sensations, was accompanied by an urgency to urinate. I urinated like 3 times in a span of 30 to 45 minutes (full bladder). Findings were normal but symptoms continued through 4/24/2021, on and off. Each episode lasts anywhere from 1 to 4 hours.  Short lasting, mild symptoms returned Monday 04/26/2021, at night, until Wednesday 04/27. However, that Wednesday night, I felt a belt like, tight sensation around the left bicep and neck. It felt as if I was being grabbed by the left arm.  On 4/29/2021, around 5:00 pm, I called an ambulance because all symptoms had returned ?full force?, such as sunken feeling, blurred vision, dizziness (like passing out), intense head and left chest pressure (in waves, like having a huge fish or parasite inside the chest and head), numb mouth (like dental anesthesia), hard to speak (hard time sending the message from brain to mouth). It took great effort to speak and felt that I had to decide whether continue speaking or staying conscious. I also had blurred vision with the first sunken feeling. Symptoms continued 2 to 3 times a day. Since 4/29 a feeling of being inside of an elevator, airplane, or earthquake, and the numbness on the left side of chest and arm remain, even when no other symptoms are present. Also, both arms become numb while sleeping, every night, multiple times a night, since 4/29. Since then, I sleep on 3 pillows (two in my head, one on the shoulders to create an angle) to minimize the numbness of the arms and the head/neck pressure while sleeping.   On 5/5/21, symptoms began while car riding as a passenger and upper body felt tight. Strangely, symptoms ended when car stopped moving. Later that day, while walking through a department store, nostrils felt uneven, as if the left nostil were breathing cold air while the right was taking warm air. That night, symptoms intensified (the attack). Like all other times, urinating was too frequent while ?the attack? is present. This time, my body felt sore and tired (Flu-like). There was an intense pressure on the right side of the eye and forehead. The neck stiffness was intense.  For the past two weeks, ?attacks? have been less frequent, about 2 to 3 times a week, lasting a maximum of 2 hours. The numbness on the left side of the chest and arm continues. The feeling of something moving or pins/needles may appear sporadically throughout the day. At times, they feel like twitches. The woozy feeling of being inside of an elevator remains. Breathing still feels heavy, like trying to breathe with the face in front of a fan.  All test results from the 2 ER visits were normal, including the CT scan. A brain MRI, done on 5/5, was also normal. A 24-hour heart monitor also had normal results.

Client&#39;s vital signs taken at 1545  and were BP 108/72, P 89, O2 99% and R 14. Client was given some water and animal crackers. Client was encouraged to drink fluids and stay hydrated. Client continued to report feeling dizzy  and tired, but reported her heavy arm had improved. Blood pressure was reassessed at 1600 and was 126/82. PHN encouraged client to rest and stay hydrated and if her symptoms did not improve or resolve she should be seen in the walk in or by a medical provider. Client verbalized understanding. Client left clinic with her husband who was giving her a ride. On 6/18/2021 at 1022 PHN placed call to client to see how client was feeling today. Call went straight to voicemail. PHN requested call back. Client returned call just before 1400 and reported symptom improvement and that client was only feeling tired today.

Friday the symptoms continued, particularly in the evening. I began monitoring my blood pressure Friday evening with the electronic arm cuff that we normally use. It is staying abnormally low, ranging between 105/68 - 109/70 on 4 different measures. My normal range stays between 115/78 at the lowest - 130/90 at the highest.  Today, all symptoms remain unchanged and blood pressure remains &lt;110/70

                                                Patient was given the Janssen vaccine and within 3 minutes the pt complained that she was lightheaded and dizzy. As I walked out of the pharmacy to see what her reaction was her muscles tensed up and she became completely rigid and stared sliding out of her chair. By appearances it looked like she was shaving a mild seizure, with a blank stare. By the time I got her down on the floor and got her coat off to see if there was an allergic reaction to the site the patient came too and asked me why she was in the floor. At that time she was clamy but knew who she was and where she was. Paramedics were called and while they were here she stated that she was dizzy and nauseous so they ended up taking her to a location hospital to be seen. While there they drew blood as a precaution.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Approx 7 p.m.,  I noticed moderate pain in my lower back, hips, and legs. Around 7 30, I felt very cold and began covering up with several blankets and turning up the heat. Husband and kids reported the house was not cold at all. Within 15 minutes, chills began and increased quickly to an almost violent state. I was shivering so badly, it became painful and scary. My husband added three blankets on top of our down comforter and sent me to bed. It took approx 15 minutes to warm up, stop shivering, and slow teeth chattering enough to relax and fall asleep. Awoke around 1:30am feeling incredibly thirsty and in desperate need of water. Upon standing, the pain in my body was excruciating which made it extremely difficult to walk. Finally in the kitchen, I took Ibuprofen 800mg and filled a large bottle with water. I began to feel incredibly dizzy and needed help from my husband to get to the couch. It took approximately 2 hours before I began to feel any relief from the ibuprofen. Around 6:30 a.m., about 60 to 65% of the pain had abated and I had finished around 100oz of water. The remainder of the day was spent feeling extreme fatigue and a general sense of unwell. Appetite was poor throughout entire event. This all continued into the evening until bedtime at 11pm. Experienced moderate insomnia overnight, falling asleep around 2:30am. Could not fall asleep due to constantly thinking about the stress of the previous 24&#43; hours. Upon waking this morning, I feel almost back up to 100%.

Patient was unable to swallow fever reducers due to fever and body trembling. Physician ordered Tylenol suppositories and Benadryl 50mg for suspected allergic reaction. Suppositories brought fever down to 103 and stopped trembling so patient was able to take Benadryl 50mg orally. Fever continued but was controlled with Tylenol.

                                                About 7 hours after the vaccine injection I started to feel flu-like symptoms: aches, chills, woozy and slightly nauseous. Within the next few hours the symptoms became increasingly worse, but not different other than the addition of a headache. I took 2 Tylenol to help with the headache and fever. Overnight sleep was difficult due to chills, sweats, fever dreams and aches. The symptoms lessened the next day (24-hours post injection), but still included muscle/body aches, headache, and extreme fatigue. Again took 2 Tylenol to help. Today (48-hours post injection) I&#39;m feeling quite a bit better although still not 100%. Soreness at injection site persists, especially when lifting my arm.

                                                Patient received her vaccine at 11:30 AM.  Immediately after receiving the Jansen vaccine, the patient reported feeling lightheaded as she stood up.  She sat in our waiting area for about 10 minutes, and reported that she felt as though her tongue was swelling.  We contacted EMS at this point, and provided a dose of Benadryl to the patient at her request.  We brought the patient into our vaccine room where she began to break out into hives.  She vomited several times.  EMS arrived shortly thereafter and checked to see if the patient was experiencing an allergic reaction.  EMS took the patient to the hospital.  At about 2 PM, the patient called the pharmacy to let us know that she was okay.  She said that it was confirmed as an allergic reaction at the hospital.  She indicated that she had received a steroid injection at the hospital and was feeling much better.  We encouraged the patient to call us at any time if she had any further problems or questions.

I drove home and started to feel nausea, a light headache, and mildly dizzy. I started to get short of breath about 45 to 50 minutes after the injection. I climbed a flight of stairs and was completely winded I was having trouble catching my breath. My lymph nodes in my neck swelled up a lot and I was developing a sore throat and small bumps on roof of mouth. I called the nurses line and was directed to take a 50 mcg dose of benadryl and that if the shortness got worse to call 911 and use my epi pen.  After about 2.5 hours the breathing seemed to primarily resolve itself and resume more normally. I woke up this morning with a very sore arm, body aches, a mild headache, congested sinuses, and with a sore throat. I do feel like I am not tasting as well as normal, it could be the congestion. I do not feel great but only seem mildly winded and short of breath walking across the house.

The hearing came back a few hours later but was muffled and echoed in the left ear for about 48 hours following the vaccine.  I tried decongestant medications and tylenol without improvement in the hearing issue.  The left ear has mostly resolved at this time but the ear is popping at times with muffled hearing intermittently.   All other symptoms are resolved.

                                                I had a very bad case of Covid in January 2021 and have not regained my taste or smell.  I was in bed for 2 weeks and had a prolonged fever up to 105 degrees--so high that I had visual and auditory hallucinations.  I had hair loss in the following months and I also continue to be fatigued.    I received the vaccination on 4/6/21 around 11am; a slight headache and face flushing occurred about 30 minutes after shot, but generally felt ok.  Woke up at 4am on 4/7/21 with chills, extreme joint pain, body aches, migraine headache, and a fever of 101.5 degrees.  Took Tylenol around 6am and went back to bed.  The migraine headache, chills, body aches, and extreme joint pain continued.  I was dizzy and extremely fatigued.  Woke up around 9 am and fever was at 102.7 degrees.  Joint pain and headache were almost unbearable at this point and I took a hydrocodone.  Took temperature around 12 pm and it was 103.5 degrees.  Fever continued rising to 104.4 degrees at 2:30 pm.  Took another Tylenol and went to sleep.  The next day, my fever had fallen back down to 102.5 degrees.  I continued with Tylenol to control me fever to around 101 degrees.   My fever persisted for 3 days.  I still have extreme fatigue, joint pain, burning scalp (which will likely mean more hair loss), zero appetite and weight loss, dizziness, blurred vision, etc.  The side effects are exactly how i felt when I got Covid in January.

                                                Thursday 04/08/21 - 1:35 PM Went to Fairgrounds to get the Johnson &amp; Johnson - Janssen COVID-19 vaccine shot with my husband. Both of us wore our masks, walked in together, went through the line together, we both got the shot in our left arms and then set together and waited the 15 minutes before we could leave. A little later at home we were working on some landscape lighting and I felt a bit foggy, light headed and kind of out of it. I was drilling into masonry and the first hole went fine but the second one for some reason just wasn?t going and I touched the drill bit with my fingertip on my left hand to see if it had smoothed out and I knew in my head not to do it and that it should be hot as heck but I didn?t feel anything at all so later that evening when I took a shower my finger was burning and I knew I had burnt it. That evening I begin to feel crippling cold, my fingernail and toenail beds had turned purple and I was shivering violently. I got under a pile of blankets with my dog and  tried to slow my breathing I could feel my heart beating in my chest and it felt like the air I was breathing was cold and frosty. I had a 104&#43; fever that night. My husband got me some aspirin a cold washcloth for my head a popsicle and water to help bring down the fever. And I was able to sleep on and off that night. When I woke up I had a 103&#43; fever and a tingling and numbness in my arms. Before the fever my arms felt tight and cold and I had a tingle that ran from my elbows to my fingertips. Again it was aspirin cold washcloth and lots of water to drink to try and get my fever down.   Friday 04/09/21 Was spent in bed trying to drink water and sleep through it. My arm was sore, not at the injection site but the whole top part of my arm felt like I had been hit by a truck. I had a fever again that evening.   Saturday 04/10/21 I thankfully woke up fever free but my arms were tingling. I had to take my husband to the airport that morning at 6:30 AM. I came back home and went back to bed until about nine when I woke up my arms were cold and sore and tingling it seemed to be getting worse in my left arm and I felt shots of electricity from my elbow down to my fingertips. At one point I took a picture because my left arm hurt so much more than the right and my fingertip beds were purple on my left and pink on my right. I took aspirin and took a nap. I couldn?t hold my phone with both hands hands like normal sitting in bed because my left hand goes cold and achy. Woke up worried that both my arms were aching and tingling from my elbows to my fingertips seems to be where it stays the most. Then that pain subsided and my lip started to tingle. After a few hours that stopped but the tingling in my arms is about constant not as strong sometimes, not in both arms sometimes, it seems to almost always be in my left arm and at one point scary enough that I almost went to the ER. Went to bed around 11:30 PM and the tips of the toes on my left side were tingling and it went to the whole leg.  Sunday 04/12/21 I woke up with a coughing fit  and mucus at around 1:00AM and my right leg with a little tingly at 4:24 AM awake again and coughing woke me had to get a drink and my stomach was buzzing and stopped now just back to the bottom half of my left leg. All of a sudden after a coughing and sneezing fit I got a tremendously sore burning throat out of no where that only lasted about five minutes. I noticed my left arm straining to hold up the pizza box tonight when my right arm had no trouble at all. Then a little later in the day stiffness in the back of my neck. It is a weird strong dry cough and I was scared to go to the ER because my symptoms were so varied and ever-changing I didn?t know what they would do with me and I didn?t want to just get stuck in there for days with him not knowing or making it worse. I told my husband ? It?s so random I?m a little scared no one is going to know what to do with me...?I?ve had issues with allergic reactions and no one being able to diagnose them and me having to figure it out on my own on the Internet that I had Thyroid problems and that I was allergic to the sun for a few years in the past and aloe vera... I didn?t wanna wind up going, them not fixing anything and having a huge bill to pay. But this whole time my body is buzzing and tingling and going through something strange. At this point I am just telling my family I?m okay and what random symptoms I have had since we spoke last. They are on standby to watch my children if I need to go to the ER. The constant buzzing, numbness, cold tingling in my arms is worrisome.   Monday 04/12/21 I am use to the numbness and tingling being a constant thing on some part of my body... There are times when I feel fine but I know it won?t last long. We can add an upset stomach and diarrhea to the list. I had a metal taste in my mouth for a little bit today. Both arms legs and my lips have randomly buzzed, ached or tingled. The websites say call 911 for emergency or call your local medical provider for assistance so I called the local ER to see if they could tell me if my symptoms were normal or if it?s something I should come in for and they couldn?t give me any advice... I was told if you feel like you should come in then come in. I had a very strong sharp pain at my elbow of my right arm tonight that made me sit up in bed...   Tuesday 4/13/21 My left arm is still sore if people touch me or if I try to sleep on my side like I normally do it hurts trying to hold my phone with both hands my arm still goes cold and achy. So far this morning my arms are both tingling and my left leg and my lips so at this point I just say I?m buzzy. 11:25 AM randomly my right arm decided to feel worse for a change but is back to a low buzz... after a few minutes. I find myself holding them up or lifting them when they hurt it seems to help a little to elevate my arms to my chest. I am just waiting to see what comes out in the media, or to see if this gets any better, or if they learn what to do about it... It isnt over, it hasnt stopped yet.

Vomiting 7 hours post vaccination (do not ever have vomiting with migraines in previous history). Severe headache and nausea continued through the next day though no more vomiting. After consulting with doctors office approximately 20 hours post vaccination, took 1 dose of tylenol (500mg x2) to help with headache. Tylenol dulled headache but did not eliminate. Nausea continued throughout day. Approximately 48 hours post vaccination nausea ceased and headache was mostly gone.

                                                15 minutes after injection: out of nowhere became extremely dizzy, nauseous,  and fainted. stayed on floor, drank water, juice, crackers, tried to get up but was too weak and almost fainted again. sweating profusely and cloudy vision so lied back down. After 1&#43; hour felt mostly better so left .   30 minutes into my drive home felt sudden onset of nausea, left fingers tingling &amp; numbing with save wave of extreme dizziness. Pulled onto median and called 911. My face started stiffening into a pucker like position and my muscles all through my body stiffened, but weakened with sharp tingling. I couldn&#39;t stand so they carried me out of car and took me to Hospital.   The rooms were full so I  was in wheelchair waiting for room, shaking profusely, blue fingers, nauseous, dizzy and couldn&#39;t stand on my own. I was able to go to restroom w/assistance but My muscles were stiffened for 1 hour&#43; and over and i felt awful. over the course of 5 hours I gained strength back and started to feel better with just mild headache and nausea.   They did EKG, blood panel and chest xray which looked ok. Diagnoses as allergic reaction and told me to come back if more issues.   The day after shot and every day since have had a headache at base of neck and pressure in cheek/forehead &#43; nauseau &#43; dizziness and extreme tired. Today is 14th and no headache today.

                                                18 hours after vaccination, developed headache with severe nausea and intermittent vomiting and fever of between 99.5-101 when read via forehead.  Symptoms lasted for approximately 10 hours, with 1-3 bouts of vomiting during that time.  Due to vomiting, OTC pain relievers taken by mouth were not effective.  Symptoms have since subsided except for weakness, slight headache, and mental fog.

Arm started to be really sore and a tight swollen bump at injection site. Severe nausea and dizziness immediately following by 10 am and extremely tired. Now almost 9 days later the lump at injection site is still there and sore. I find this very concerning and uncomfortable.  The nausea lasted about 12 hours. The tiredness and dizziness lasted about 7 days. The bad pounding headache lasted all day followed by mild headaches throughout the week.

                                                Super intense headache that I had never felt in my life for 3 days, now it hurts from time to time but less intense. Nausea, dizziness, maybe temperature. An intense body pain (it was the first thing that happened to me along with a headache), because of that I had a fall with scrapes on my knee, to this day the body pain continues although it is minor but that causes me a lot of tiredness and for that reason I stopped working. In summary the symptoms continue but with less intensity, as well as dizziness and nausea from time to time.

Seven days after the vaccine I began having dizzy spells, extreme fatigue and nausea, blurred vision, extreme right head pressure, floaty sensation, numbness and tingling in my right arm and leg, muscle spasms, and extreme anxiety. All things I have never experienced before. And they have persisted daily since they began. My first period one week after the injection was a couple days late and very light and only lasted a few days, which is also not normal roe me. I have short periods of relief and then the symptoms return. It is very scary and I need help. I have been to my pcp several times and the Er. They can?t explain my symptoms.

I am scheduled to see an ENT doctor today. I had to go to the emergency room because I was throwing up starting two hours after the vaccine and I was in pain all over my body. I became extremely fatigued, and I could not stop throwing up. I was given Reglan, to stop the vomiting, and I am still taking it twice daily after four weeks. I was also given Benadryl which seemed to help. I tried to stop taking the nausea medicine after three weeks and the vomiting returned. I threw up eight times that day. I still have aches in my legs and ear pain every day after four weeks. My fatigue has improved a little.

I feel fatigue from Covid-19 since I had it in December and this vaccine seemed to make me feel worse all over again.

                                                Started that day chills and three four hours hot and shaky. I could not work a couple days feeling like very very sick, nauseous. three or four days and went away slow.  Missed  work last week, diarrhea, getting sick off and on since the covid shot feeling like the flu. But tests negative. Sometimes I am perfectly fine, sometimes very sick and very down. Happens randomly. Could not even get up from the bed. Still taking nausea pills and pills for pain, body aches.

It stayed that size for 4 days, and then finally started getting a little smaller each day. It&#39;s officially been 10 days and I would say that lymph node is about golf ball sized now. I did see my doctor and she said it can be a normal side effect and as long as it&#39;s going down not to worry. I also was having pain in my back and the doctor suspected a possible pe, my d-dimer test came back positive twice but my platelets remained in the normal range.

                                                I had COVID in January 2021 but got the vaccine as soon as I could.  I had no unusual or long lasting side effects post recovery.  The day of and day after I received my vaccine had a typical reaction -- body aches, fever &gt;102, etc.  On April 26th I started experiencing severe cramping which is unusual because I have a Mirena IUD.  This resulted in diarrhea and vomiting (from the pain, not nausea).  On the 27th I had the same symptoms plus a fever of 100.8.  The fever continued for another day or two.  On May 29th I again started experiencing cramping, diarrhea and vomiting.  On the May 30th I had cramping, diarrhea and starting running a temp greater than 100.4.  This continued off and on for 7 more days.  Some days I had severe cramping/diarrhea, some I ran fever up to 102.5, some days I experienced both.  The fever always starts mid afternoon to late evening.  On June 25th I started experiencing cramping, diarrhea and vomiting again.  On June 26th I had the same gastro/pelvic issues and my fever reached 100.9 and on the 28th it was up to 102.9.  The fever is always treated with alternating Tylenol/Advil every 4 hours and is still getting that high.

                                                The day following my vaccine, I became extremely nauseous and fatigued.  I was unable to lift my head or open my eyes because of extreme dizziness/nausea for 24 hours. Over the next 2 months, ending around June 11th, I had migraines almost every other day, constant nausea, and a few migraines that lasted 3-4 days.  At one point, I needed to go to the ER to get relief from the migraine.  This helped for about 3 days before the migraines returned.  At 2 months out, the migraines have improved, but I still have very tight muscles and stiffness throughout my body, a symptom that I often get along with migraines.

                                                Sore arm immediately after receving the vaccine. On Friday 4/16, my left upper thigh had a throbbing pain, almost like a charlie horse. That continued for 2 weeks, alternating legs. It ended up becoming prominent in my left leg, so much so that I had an ultrasound on my left leg on 4/23/21. On 4/24/21 I got a sharp headache, the whole right side of my face went numb. On 4/26/21 I called my doctor to tell them what happened and they sent me to the ER.  I was in the ER for 16 hours. In the ER I had bloodwork, MRI and an ultrasound on left leg. I was discharged from the ER.  On 4/30/21 I started getting chest pain/burning sensation. I went to urgent care on 5/3/21 for it. I was given lidocaine to numb my esophagus to rule out heart related chest pain. They did an EKG of my heart as well.   I was sent home with pantoprazole. They diagnosed that it was heart burn related to the vaccine.  I went back to the urgent care 5/7/21 because the chest pain was worse. They did a chest xray, and told me to continue, pantoprazole, tylenol and mylanta and stated they did not see anything wrong with my heart.  After this I went to family doctor for a follow up closer to the end of May. The chest pain was still there and soft to the touch, along with pain (squeezing feeling) in my left arm.  Also, my armpits have been swollen. The doctors think I have Costochondritis. They tell me to take 2 tylenol every 4 hours. It does get better for about 2 weeks then 6/10/21 it comes back with the same symptoms. On 6/14/21 I go back to the doctor and was given a steroid for one week, the steroid alleviates the inflammation. When the steroid is done, the symptoms come back. The symptoms come and go, some days are better than others.

                                                It started with joint pain on left side at the elbow and wrist. Then it progressed to all-over body aches. Then every joint became achy, even spine and toes. One of the left lymph nodes at the base of the skull became swollen like a golf ball. Then the throat lymph nodes also became swollen. I had fatigue to the point of needing to nap throughout the day; this comes and goes. I have weakness in the hands. Most recently, I have had shortness of breath, even after doing nothing. I have had earaches recently. I tested positive for mono, even though no one in my life has it. This has all been going on for over 2 months now. The doctor says I display some of the symptoms of Guillain-Barre Syndrome. He says that if I display tingling in the extremities, I am to go to the ER. On 7/19/2021, I am going to have my spleen examined, because I have had nausea and pain in that area.

From about 7:00 pm to about midnight, I felt awful.  I couldn&#39;t walk down a short hall without assistance.  I was so sore and achy I couldn&#39;t really sleep.  I felt insanely hot, yet had chills and I had a terrible headache.  I am type 1 diabetic, and my blood sugar spiked to over 200, where it hovered between 200 &amp; 300 most of the night, despite the fact that I used insulin to try and lower it.  From 10 pm to midnight, I felt nauseous.  Overnight was ok.  I still had some of those symptoms, but could sleep off and on.  I probably woke up every couple of hours.  I was till very sore and hot, but not as hot, and still had a headache.  Today, I took Tylenol this morning.  I still have a mild headache, sore body, tired and a little slow, but significantly better than last night.

                                                Patient received the vaccine and went to sit down in the chair. Patient stated she started feeling nauseous and light headed so asked if she can wait outside for some fresh air. When she went outside, she sat on the edge of the stairs and fell backwards and passed out. The store manager was there to catch her before her head hit the pavement. Patient wasn&#39;t alert for about 2 minutes. Pharmacist came out and assessed the patient and she was communicative. She was in and out but was able to tell us her name, DOB and where she was. We sat her up,  gave her some water, and waited with her. She requested not to call the ambulance. I checked her pulse at 1:15pm and it was 92. I checked her pulse again at 1:30pm and it went down to 72. Patient was fully alert and speaking in full sentences by 1:35pm. She called her mom and was able to stand up without feeling dizzy. She walked to the car with assistance and was driven home by her mother.

                                                Dizziness immediately following vaccine. Slight headache, moderate muscle aches, severe pain at injection site. It was also swollen with redness, itching, and it was hot. . Never had a fever. I immediately started taking Benadryl every 4 hours. I had really bad nausea (no vomiting)  to the point I was unable to eat and lost 7 lbs. I had really bad cold sweats so bad I was drenched with sweat multiple times a day for over a week. I ended up going to the walk in clinic about 5 days after the injection and was given Zofran for nausea.  I was also told I had a moderate allergic reaction to the vaccine and any other time they would start me on steroids but they said if I took steroids it would make the vaccine not work. So I was told to continue Benadryl and deal with it.  To this day which will be two weeks tomorrow since I received the shot I still have a hard hot lump in my arm, I still break out in cold sweats, and still have a little nausea.  Never had wheezing or issues breathing though.

Woke up with headache and chills at 3:15am.  Took temperature - no fever (98.0).  Went back to sleep until 6am.  Woke up with a headache and chills again and took temperature again - no fever (98.6).  Could only stomach ginger tea.  Attended a computer work meeting at 7am, and couldn&#39;t stay awake after that.  Was back in bed before 8am.  Slept until 10:45am (24 hours after injection) and woke up feeling OK and hungry.  It&#39;s now 1:45 pm April 8, and I feel mostly fine but still unusually tired.

                                                Approximately 13 hours after receiving the vaccine, I woke up in the night with nausea, chills, fever, spinal pain, joint and bone pain, and the worst headache of my life that I could feel in my brain stem and spinal cord. I also experienced confusion and difficulty walking to the bathroom. The headache was not relieved by OTC pain relievers. I had difficulty sleeping and felt restless. I felt the fever ?break? around 5am with profuse sweating. I had to miss work today (I am a nurse myself who was actually working at the clinic when I received my vaccine). It is now 3pm and after taking a sleep aid and sleeping all day, I do feel better, but the headache remains. I had H1N1 about 10 years ago and aside from that, this is probably the sickest I?ve ever been and it is, with certainty, due to the Covid vaccine.

THESE SIDE EFFECTS PROGRESSED AND WERE WORSE 4 HOURS POST-VACCINATION.   THE DAY AFTER VACCINATION, AFTER REGISTERING WITH V-SAFE, A REPRESENTATIVE CALLED A.C.  AND TOLD HER TO TAKE 75 MG DIPHENHYDRAMINE.  THE REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT A.C.  WAS HAVING A MODERATE REACTION TO THE VACCINE (A.C. DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANAPHYLAXIS).  MOST OF THESE ADVERSE REACTIONS IMPROVED AFTER TAKING THE DIPHENHYDRAMINE.   TODAY, 2 DAYS POST-VACCINATION, A.C.  IS NO LONGER HAVING ANY SIDE EFFECTS AND IS RECOVERED.

Most symptoms lasted three full days.  One week after the vaccination and I still have confusion, dizziness, and vertigo like symptoms. If I look up or down or side to side too quickly, I feel extremely dizzy and nauseated. I can?t stand for more than about 5 minutes without feeling dizziness and nausea set in, even getting on my bike causes nausea and dizziness, driving, walking, anything related to movement. **Only had one vaccine - the form added a second set of boxes above and won?t let me remove it on this form.

By 930 pm approximately 12 hours after shot I was running a Very high fever and had EXTREME chills, body aches, latharic and my arm hurt bad. There was no discoloration or swelling in the arm however. I expected these side effects but they were so much worse then expected or discribed. My husband had same effects. We are both very healthy and active young adults. This felt like a SEVERE 24 hour flu. Not, &#34;flu-like&#34;. I would be very afraid of we had ANY underlying health conditions. Also my heart had a cramping burning pain that came and went. No fluttering, it felt like the muscle was contracting around my heart or the actual heart was contracting and staying contracted for about 5 minutes at a time. This occured only to me and happened about 3-4 times withing the first 24 hours with the first experience while I was at the pharmacy being monitored for the 15 minute post shot. I have no known underlying heart issues and have never been diagnosed with any heart problems or been seen for any such issue. But it was real and it was scary.   I took 1, 500mg tylenol at 930pm the day of the shot for the fever and aches.  I took 1, 500mg tylenol at 9am the fallowing morning, as I was still experiencing aches and a low fever. It has been 48hours and I am still feeling lathargic. But more as expected.

I was terrified because this was something I had never felt before. The symptoms began to fade within 4 hours and then I experienced the &#34;normal&#34; side effects, such as arm pain and tiredness.

Ended up leaving work a little over 2 hours after I started.  I was feeling nausea, achy, chills, fatigue, dizziness/lightheaded, sore arm.  Went home and to bed.  Still fatigued, sore arm and a little achy the next day.  Now on day 4 since vaccine and am still experiencing a sore arm &amp; fatigue(improving but not back to my normal energy level).  On a positive note my ongoing sinus symptoms(since June 2020) have improved.  They are not gone but noticeably improved.  I&#39;m thankful for that and hoping it lasts!!!!

Other events - odd headache that lasted about 24 hours, pain when touching face lasted about 12 hours, &amp; back, neck, shoulder and upper arms all painful like I had been at the gym for three days straight - lasted about 24 hours. Brain fog that lasted about 5 to 6 days. Dizzy spells for about 5 days.

Headache that felt like no other I&#39;ve had primarily on left side above my ear. Vomiting and urination. Fatigue. Weakness.  I was on the verge of going to ER called on-call doctor instead. They advised me to try and get through the next few hours. They also ended up calling me in a medication to help with my vomiting. I was sick for a little over 24 hours with main symptoms. Still feel worn down.

Later that same evening, experienced nausea, muscle, bone, and joint aches as well as chest pain that were much reduced by the following morning. Malaise continued as did symptoms of nausea without vomiting.  24 hours post injection, experienced a low grade fever of 99.6 F (for me, this is a low grade temp). Fever broke after another 24 hours.  Experienced severe headaches in the middle of the forehead for 8-12 hours on 3/25/2021, 3/29/2021, 4/3/2021.  Experienced difficulty breathing 3/30/2021. Woke up from deep sleep feeling starved for oxygen and a sensation that a deep enough breath could not be taken--the lungs could  not expand enough. Respiratory rate seemed slightly depressed. It passed after about 30 minutes with focused effort on taking deep, regular breaths. Fell asleep again and did not consult a medical provider about it. The oxygen hunger / breathing issue did not repeat.  Medical professionals were not consulted for any of the episodes described above.

As the day went on, started feeling more soreness and headache. By 7 pm that night, I was extremely fatigued and nauseated. Pain very bad in my arm that night to where I could not sleep. Each day that has gone on, I have had worsening fatigue, headaches, and an increase in my heart rate, and a decrease in my blood pressure. I&#39;ve had an increase in brain fog and an increase in sleep issues. The pain in my arm went away after 4 or 5 days.

                                                Received the J&amp;J Covid Vaccine shoot on Sunday, April 11th at the  Clinic. The night of receiving my shot, I had a migraine and neck pain which resulted in trouble sleeping.  When I got up in the morning, I started having severe muscle pain in my thighs and in my calf, mild cramps in the abdomen.  The leg pain lasted the entire day with exhaustion, which interfered with my ability to work a full day.  When I went to bed later that night, I still had pain behind my left knee and I was worried about if there was a blood clot.  I got up the next morning and my legs were still cramping but improved from the prior day.  When I saw the news discussing the blood clot issue associated with the J&amp;J vaccine, I felt it was important to contact my Dr. to discuss the leg pain.  They did an ultrasound (vascular scan) on my left leg and follow up with my doctor&#39;s office walk-in clinic after the scan.  My legs were examined and no clots were identified.  We discussed things to watch for.

                                                Patient reports: &#34;I received my covid 19 vaccine on Friday April 9th (J&amp;J) and need to report my reactions afterward. Had the usual immediate arm pain after injection along with nausea. Took a Benadryl and napped when got home and woke up 6 hours after injection with a tingling and swollen lower lip and constricted breathing. Took 3 Benadryl in fear of going to hospital and waited it out. Once lip went back to normal as well as breathing went to bed since it was late and slept all day Saturday. Woke up Sunday in agony from lower back pain and tailbone. Now, thurs 4/15 still in extreme pain in my tailbone. Went twice to chiropractor to help and nothing is alleviating the pain and have been practically bed ridden since Sunday. Can?t work, can?t sit, can?t walk can?t stand can?t anything without extreme pain. Been taking ibuprofen everyday and not helping.&#34;   She had a visit with us on 4/15/2021: &#34;Patient here for extreme pain on her tailbone. She had the Johnson and Johnson vaccine about 6 days ago and about 6 hours later she woke up with a tingling and swollen lip, constricted breathing, and dizziness. She wanted to avoid the hospital, so she took benadryl 75 mg and it slowly resolved her symptoms. These symptoms have not returned since. She was finally able to fall asleep that night and then slept all day the next day. The following day she woke up and experienced extreme pain in her lower back and tailbone. She saw her chiropractor twice this past week, which helped to resolve her low back pain. Per patient her chiropractor noted that her back seemed very inflamed. However, she is still having extreme pain with her tailbone and is unable to sit, stand, bend or work for more than 20 minutes without extreme pain. The only thing that seems to improve her pain is laying on her back with several pillows tucked behind and all around her. However, she is only able to stay in this position for a period of time before her body becomes stiff from immobility. She has been taking ibuprofen 600 mg TID, flexeril PRN, icing and applying moist heat to her back, but none of these measures seem to improve her pain. Lastly she has noticed that when she sits/stands for too long, her buttocks start to spasm. Denies fever, chills, n/v, numbness, tingling, incontinence or loss of bowel/bladder function.&#34;

Loss of appetite that lasted for two weeks and went away.  4. Three weeks after vaccination, I  developed extreme back muscle tightness and spasms that have not resolved yet. The tightness runs from the base of the neck on either side of the spinal column down the length of the back.

I have never experienced muscle tightness that went down the entire length of my back it cannot be resolved by muscular therapy.

                                                I immediately felt sharp pain and burning in my arm while being injected. The burning in my arm lasted for about 20 minutes. I got a severe migraine about an hour after the vaccine that lasted for about ten hours.  I broke out in hives all over my body later that night, the same day as the vaccine. I also had intense heartburn. I never get heartburn so this is not normal for me. The following day, I was still having hives and started also having chest pains. I was consistently taking antihistamines to keep the hives under control. On Saturday morning, 2 days after the vaccine, I was still breaking out in hives. My throat also started to swell and I was having a hard time breathing. My heartburn was also getting more severe. I ended up going to urgent care. There I was prescribed 2 stronger antihistamines and prednisone to help with my reaction. I was also given an epi pen.  Later that night, I ended up going to the ER as I was having severe chest pain. I have a history of DVT so I was concerned about blood clots. I had several tests done along with a chest CT scan. Thankfully everything came back clear for blood clots and heart attack. The ER doctor could not explain why I was having chest pain and advised me to monitor it and to come back in if it got worse. The following day, I was still needing antihistamines for hives and difficulty breathing. I woke up in the middle of the night with severe stomach pain and cramping. I had intense vomiting and diarrhea. The diarrhea started to have a lot of blood in it. I went back urgent care and they sent me for a CT scan which showed I now had colitis. The bleeding lasted for about 3 days.

                                                First felt light headed, then my tongue, throat, and neck felt sore within approximately one hour of injection. Then my eyes started itching and it was more difficult to breathe through my nose. Things looked funny/off and I felt off; heavy/like lead and fuzzy and spacey at the same time. My vision was blurry when I tried to look at objects up close - like my phone. I had to blink several times and hold the object further away to see it. By dinner time, around 5:30, I noticed raised bumps on the sides and back of my tongue. To my knowledge, they were not there prior to the injection, but I don?t usually inspect my tongue. I did so around dinner because of how sore, puffy, swollen, and big my tongue felt. It looked splotchy in shades of white and yellow. My throat also felt puffy and swollen. At 3:50 am I woke up and my left eye was puffy and difficult to see out of. I was cold, clammy, and sweating. I had a really bad headache and felt nauseous. I took 2 ibuprofen and went back to bed. Around 7:30 or 8:00 am I got up and moved around. My left eye was no longer puffy and I could open it, but my eyes, nose, and throat were itching so badly that I wanted to scratch at them. My tongue, throat, and respiratory system felt puffy and swollen. I noticed it took much more effort to breathe. I got some water and took a Benadryl. I layed down and put  my feet up. I covered up because I was cold. I fell asleep. A few hours later I woke up and could breathe easier. The itching was less intense and my tongue, throat, and respiratory system felt less swollen and more normal.

On March 30 &amp; 31 I would have massive nausea.  On 4/2 after dinner I started to have chest pain.  This lasted into the night and I had cold sweats, nausea, vertigo and went to the ER.  CTScan w/contrast was done, chest Xray, EKG was adnormal.  Was admitted to the cardiac unit for observation.  Was there 24 hours.  On 4/4, I was still having the chest pain, went to another cardiologist where I had another EKG, Stress test, blood work. Everything looked good, couldn&#39;t figure out why I was having chest pain.  Echo was scheduled. The night of 4/6 the vertigo increased drastically where I couldn&#39;t close my eyes and go to sleep, went to the dr on 4/7 and that is when it was thought that it was tied to the vaccine.  Was put on meclazine for the vertigo as needed.  It was then that the anxiety and depression started.  By body broke out in Hives, was put on allergy medicine to help with those.  Unexplained bruising was occurring on my legs.  Was put on a Mediterranean diet which is supposed to help with inflammation. Stopped drinking caffeine and alcohol. The vertigo, anxiety and depression continues.  I had an MRI of my brain to see if there was anything showing. Bloodwork was done. Started to experience breast pain, went to my dr, had a mammogram and ultrasound to see if anything was there.  Lymph nodes are still swollen, have to go back in 6 weeks. Went to an ENT for the vertigo and he found some of the crystals in my ears, I&#39;ve never had that before. On 4/29 I had a hair appt where 1 minute after she put the hair dye on my hair, I experienced more vertigo.  Still experience the depression and anxiety, hoping that subsides very soon.

She stated she really didn&#39;t feel well and we prepared to move her to a lying down position.  Before lying down patient passed out.  She continued breathing with a pulse.  We called 911.  She remained out for approximately one minute, with stimulus not waking her.  While moving patient out of the chair to a lying down position she awoke on her own.  She had no previous medical conditions or routine medications, though did say she had passed out before.  EMTs arrived and questioned patient but did not do a physical assessment.  She did not want to go to the hospital.  Patient did remain in the pharmacy for 45 minutes after.  We checked HR and BP, both were within normal limits.  We drove patient home where here daughter was present.  Patient stated she was still nauseated when she got home but seemed better an hour later

Couldn&#39;t walk was shaking so much.  Speaking was difficult.  Breath was labored.  It was so scary my husband called the doctor.  Shook violently with teeth chattering for 45 minutes then would break for a few minutes before shaking again.  The shaking was probably 60 minutes total.  Then fever set in.  Fever hit 102.4 at 6:15pm.  102.9 at 6:40pm.  103.8 at 8:15pm.  Fever ranged between 102.3 and 103.8 for 8 hours after starting then finally broke 1:45am (8 1/2 hours after the shaking started).  Was able to get out of bed 8:00am today.  Massive headache for the morning but no fever today.  26 1/2 hours post vaccine new and I just feel very tired and drained.

I sat on the floor and started vomiting. I kept gagging nonstop for several minutes. During that time I urinated on myself, I felt strong stomach aches, headache, and my body felt extremely fatigued.  I was dizzy and sweating. All these symptoms came back again a few minutes later. I do not remember how long everything lasted. I woke up the next day with a slightly upset stomach and headache.

I was able to sleep all night the following night with some NyQuil.  The second day, I woke up feeling still a little weak and tired, but the body aches have subsided significantly.  It&#39;s nothing crazy, but it felt like I should report so there is more information for the researchers and public.  I did have COVID March/April 2020.  I had body aches, fatigue, chest tightness, loss of taste and smell, but NO FEVER.  It was undiagnosed at the time (no fever), but in October 2020, I gave blood and I did have COVID antibodies.  I gave again in January 2021 and I still had the COVID antibodies.  I received the vaccine March 10.  Thank you!

Around 3-4 hours later is when the real symptoms began. First, an extremely rapid heartbeat. My left arm began to feel numb. And I was seized by an episode of extraordinary fatigue. 6 hours after the shot, I was having muscle and joint pain to the point that I felt like I was being stabbed with knives - particularly in my tailbone, ankles, and shoulders. High fever followed, uncontrollable chills and shivering, intestinal pain, diarrhea, and intestinal cramps. The following day I had a headache and continuing extreme fatigue as well as pain in both arms.

                                                Immediate dizziness and nausea. Became tachycardic within an hour. This is still an issue 3 weeks out. Day after vaccine I felt mild flu symptoms all day and was struck with a severe chest pain and intense nausea in the afternoon. I went to the hospital emergency room and had multiple tests run. No cause was found for the chest pain. It began in the center of my chest and moved to the right side of my back.  I have been dizzy, nauseous and extremely fatigued as well as a headache for the last three weeks. The doctor didn&#39;t know what caused the pain. He checked me for a pulmonary embolism  because my clotting factors were slightly elevated.  They have not been rechecked,  though I requested my doctor have them and my platelets rechecked. I still do not feel well. My brain is foggy, my vision gets blurry at times, and I still have the dizziness,  fatigue and nausea. I am no longer achy and I have not had another chest pain like the one I had on the 26th.

While I was getting her tylenol she fainted, hitting her head on the floor. When she came to, she started experiencing the chills along with an irregular body temperature. I put blankets on her, gave her water, and tended to her eye. I was able to move her from the floor to the bed within 15 minutes. She fell asleep around 2am. She has been doing better but has been experiencing off &amp; on headaches &amp; nausea. We did not go to the doctor since we do not have insurance.

On Sunday morning 04-11-2021, I had horribleheadaches and I took a Tylenol but it did not help. On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday I again woke up with headaches and I felt extremely fatigued. I went to see my PCP who performed blood tests and also did a D-dimme test which the tests came back as being okay. I also experienced a full body rash and was having slight breathing issues. I also went to see an allergist on Monday 04-12-2021 due to my whole body rash, patchy skin, red and white bumps on my forehead. I was also concerned because at the inside of my mouth and upper pallet I had red bumps which lasted three days. I took me a whole week to recover from these symptoms.

The next morning I felt the more intense side effects (fever of 101.1, chills, fever,  extreme sweat, loss of appetite, body aches and fatigue).  While the majority of the side effects have passed I still have no appetite.  I am a very healthy adult that does strength training  4x a week, I typically eat and snack every 3 hours.  Since the vaccination day I have no desire to eat and I am down to 2 meals (breakfast and dinner). I am also experiencing headaches and dizziness but this could be from the lack of nutrients.  Because I feel dizzy I am forcing myself to eat as I almost fainted during a morning workout and had shortness of breath. This particular morning I had coffee, a protein shake and a banana prior to my workout.  I have not read or seen any additional information on the loss of appetite lasting this long and I am getting concerned

EMT was called and transported me to the hospital when a CT Scan and EKG was performed. I was given IV fluids, monitored and released after some time.  Over the next few days I felt absolutely awful.  On 4/15 I had a phone F/U visit with my PCP.  I still havent felt to myself to date and had to go back to the ER last night because I was so nauseaed and dizzy I couldnt stand or do anything and I am still having the diarreah also

                                                The day I received the Janssen vaccine, I had pain at the injection site immediately, which was to be expected. My arm was very sore for over a week. I felt ill at dinnertime but was able to eat. Around 10:30 PM I started to feel like my skin was on fire. It was hot to the touch as well. However, I was freezing and couldn&#39;t get warm. My teeth were chattering. I started crying uncontrollably. I have never had tears run so hard down my face. The tears felt like they were burning my skin because my skin felt so hot. I awoke my husband to help me. He wanted to take me to the Emergency Room, but I wanted to wait. My muscles ached terribly. I had to pace back and forth because of the intense pain. My head also felt like it was going to blow off of my body. It wasn&#39;t like a normal headache. It felt like I had swelling in my brain. The left side of my head was sore for days afterwards. I then became terribly nauseated. I didn&#39;t throw up but felt like I was going to. I also felt extremely dehydrated. I was able to drink some water. It was a very long night. Looking back, I probably should have gone to the ER. My husband worked from home the next day so he could be available if needed. It took a long time for me to fully recover. I woke up exhausted and struggled with fatigue for a while and had extreme exhaustion in the evenings. My ears would turn bright red in the evenings and feel hot to the touch. I still have some fatigue now but am mostly better.

For the 15 (FIFTEEN) days that followed I experienced severe nausea. I was unable to eat almost all solid food. I slept about 18 hours per day solid sleep. Blunt headache all the time. Diarrhea started week 2 and the intense nausea did not subside. It was not until a full 15 days later that the nausea finally subsided and I was able to get out of bed for more than a couple of hours at a time. Finally now April 27th I  feel almost back to my normal self.

I started choking on my own spit. My hands got really big. I couldn&#39;t talk. The pharmacist told my friend to take me to the ER. I could kind of spit out stuff. She took me to Urgent Care. They gave me an epi-pen and instantly my tongue got small.  Through an IV they gave me: Prednisone, Benadryl and fluids  - by the time the IV was done I felt 90% okay. Four about 4 or 5 days - I would get fat fingers and itching. I would still have trouble swallowing - kind of choked when I swallowed. About 5 days after the event the allergy part was gone. I had three days of an oral steroid I was suppose to take and two weeks of Zyrtec. I did have flu-like symptoms also on the night of the vaccine. I had COVID in December 2020.

                                                Within one minute of receiving the vaccine, I lost consciousness/ passed out. When I came to, it took me awhile to realize where I was and what had happened. I was alone in the room. I eventually realized that I was sweating profusely as of water have been poured all over me, something I have never experienced before. Then I began vomiting violently. I couldn&#39;t move because I kept almost passing out and I continued vomiting. The two vaccine workers kept wanting to call an ambulance for me but I didn&#39;t see what an ambulance could do for me and it was hard to respond to them. I could not get up or move myself or leave the store by myself. After about a half-hour I contacted my sons to come to the store and help me. When my son&#39;s arrived, approximately 15 minutes after all of my Adverse Events began, they helps me out to the car in the parking lot and I continued vomiting violently, even on the drive home. Once at home, I took anti nausea / anti vomiting meds and after an hour or two I could sit up and sip water. By that night, I had fevers and the continued throughout the night along with a migraine like headache. The next day continue taking the anti-nausea meds but I still was not able to move around or eat and I had fevers add headaches severe muscle aches and soreness throughout the day and the next night. For the next several days, I was no longer taking the anti nausea meds and I just constantly felt like I was going to pass out and vomit. It felt like all the blood had been drained from my face. It was hard for me to sit or stand or walk around. I tried to work remotely but even just sitting up in my home to a computer was very difficult. I felt dizzy and light-headed and nauseous constantly. On a Thursday, the 10th, I suddenly became very cold and chilled even though I had not had a fever that day. I laid down on my bed with a blanket to try to warm up but my teeth were violently chattering and my hands and feet were ice cold but profusely sweating like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced on my hands and feet. My arms and legs started shaking so badly it was more like Tremors bordering on convulsions. It was a very scary and I would have gone to the hospital but I could not safely drive. This lasted about an hour and after it went away, it never came back. I last had a fever on Sunday, the 13th. It was approximately 101. I have not had a fever for a headache after that day but I still felt light-headed and nauseous until June 18th. I have been feeling basically normal since the 18th. I am hopeful that I will not have any more effects but I&#39;m wondering how and where I should report any others?

The next day the chills were gone but I still had a headache which I had to take off work, it lasted a week. One week after the shot I experienced shortness of breath and my Reynaud?s symptoms were bad. My fingers and toes were blue. I had leg pain and I was concerned for a blood clot. I returned to the ER a week later because I had shortness of breath and chest pressure. I continued to have sharp chest pain for four weeks. I also saw a Pulmonary specialist six weeks after the vaccine and tests were normal. I am scheduled to see a Rheumatologist.

Fatigue, joint pain and an occasional chill (better then the next day). Monday - Joint pain and occasional chills - those continued for the rest of the week and Wednesday I also had a migraine headache. Friday - severe migraine and vomiting and my doctor sent me to ER.  Medication for the Migraine - three different things - one was an IV Benadryl - the others I don&#39;t know. That cleared my symptoms up that same day just a couple hours later. I have been fine every since.

                                                I received the J&amp;J vaccine last Thursday afternoon 7.8.21 and had a very strong reaction to the shot.  The vaccine was received at 3:30pm and sometime after midnight I started experiencing intense body aches and pain with some abdominal pain. After waking up I was also having severe headaches and was light sensitive. This continued throughout the day Friday and I was unable to get out of bed at all. I slept for hours at a time and was so uncomfortable the other times that it was difficult to even find a position that felt good. On Saturday this got a little better but remained with body aches and bad headaches until late afternoon where I was sweating for several hours and then quickly regained my energy and the headaches resolved early evening. It was about 40 hours worth and pretty difficult. I reported this to my Doctor who suggested I enter the information into the vaers site.

Fever continued until around 6am despite taking more tilt at 2am. Finally got to sleep at 6am. Woke with remaining stiffness and headache at 7:30am. Nausea continued for another 6 hours. Headache continued for another 6 hours. Muscles remained sore due to severe cramping last night.

                                                I had burning with the actual injection.  It burned as it went in and went down a small ways into my left arm.  The rest of the day I had the normal symptoms- Pounding headache, nausea, horrible body aches (couldn?t lay down or stand to be comfortable).  That night around 11:45pm I got up to let my dog in and I started seeing small black dots- blurry vision.  I felt nauseas.  I ended up falling on the floor.  I was able to get up.  I then ended up waking up in the bathroom on the floor and had no idea how I had gotten there.  My hands were vibrating.  I called my husband from work to come help me up.  I was able to sleep and didn?t seek medical attention.  I am not sure if it was low blood pressure or what could have happened I have never experienced that before.  I did contact my doctor?s office this afternoon via (online) but haven?t had a response yet.  I have been in bed all day today.  - Body aches, nausea, pounding headache

                                                Event took place at an off-site event, in a detention facility. Pt received Janssen COVID vaccine around 4:00 pm. Pt immediately reported nausea. Nurse accompanied pt to the restroom about 2 minutes after receiving vaccine, where she gagged into the sink and spit up a little clear fluid. Pt reported feeling hot and sat down in a chair available in the restroom. Pt and nurse joined by a second nurse. Shortly after sitting down pt complained of feeling dizzy and was moved to the floor to lay down. When laying down, pt appeared flushed under her chin and complained of chest tightness. She requested to sit up to help with breathing. Called 911 and first dose of epinephrine (0.5 mL of 1mg/1mL) administered, both at 4:10 pm. Pt reported no change in chest tightness following epi, but continued to respond to questions. She said she felt tired and wanted to go to sleep. Pt continued to report difficulty breathing, and another dose of epinephrine administered at 4:15 pm. A physician at GEO arrived and administered oxygen. He listened to pt&#39;s heart and lungs and reported that there was air movement in her lungs. Pt ceased to respond coherently to questions, slurring and moaning, but did not lose consciousness. Pt started tapping her lips and, upon questioning, said they felt numb. Third dose of epinephrine administered at 4:20 pm. Nurse continued to jostle patient and ask her questions, and patient continued to respond with short, slurred answers. EMS arrived at 4:23 pm and transported patient to the hospital.

The fever continued the next day and stayed around 100.3 and went down to 99.4. Today (4/9) me fever has subsided. In addition to the what is listed I had, and continue, to have muscle soreness and pain in my stomach. I also have pain in my joints. I have also noticed that my vision is not clear is blurred and that continues. My stomach pain and pain in my legs continue at this moment and I am very tired.

                                                Visited ER as I thought I was having an allergic reaction. Treated with Pepcid, prescribed prednisone and streeted. Visited personal allergy physician 4/9/21. per MD Allergist/Immunologist DXd = systemic immunological vasculitis. Most probably a delayed hyper immune response to my vaccine. Legs, arms and sides covered in innumerable petechial eruptions beginning 6 days post vaccination and 3 days post vaccination side effects (chills, headache nausea) subsided. Eruptions spread consistently for 36 hours and are constant not intermittent. They are hot, painful to the touch, and do not blanch. I?m on 60mgs of prednisone for 5 days (the highest dose given outside a hospital) and then 40 for 5 days and then 20 for 4 days. If I get any mouth nose or eye or interior genital irritation I have to go to the hospital and be admitted for higher dose steroids and constant monitoring. Dr advised  this  will take weeks to resolve and the eruptions will likely fade slowly and possibly peel.

While she was waiting she experienced dizziness. Patient stated that she started sweating and felt like it was hard to breath and pain in the stomach. This reaction happened 5 minutes after vaccine was administered. Family members and pharmacy personnel called 911. Patient started feeling better after 10 minutes. Patient&#39;s blood pressure and pulse was within normal range. Patient stated that this has happened twice when she gets blood work if she does not eat before but patient said that she had a meal before being vaccinated. We contacted the patient after the reaction and she stated that she was feeling better.

I walked down my hall and saw black dots and felt dizzy with nausea.  The next thing I knew I was on the bathroom floor and didn?t remember how I had gotten there.  It is Friday and I now am experiencing shooting pains in the side of my head.  I also have been experiencing pains in my calf muscles and some chest pains.  I am still extremely tired and having abdominal pain.  I have contacted my doctor?s office about the fainting but I am going to call Monday to get an appointment to get checked out.  I am concerned about possible blood clots.

Now on the month of April I first started spotting on April 7th it was very light then it went heavy till this day 4/13/2021 I&#39;m still bleeding which is not normal because my period normally only lasts for 4 days. On 3/31/2021 I also had chest pain that lasted for 4 days then it started subsiding. On 3/12/2021 and on 04/11/2021 I got a weird abdominal pain that lasted for less than 5 minutes.

That mostly resolved after 2 days.  Then 1 week later on Saturday, I started having pain in my left leg where I had had RFA of the greater saphenous vein 6 months prior.  Leg swelled up got a hard knot.  I got dizzy &amp; nauseated.  The pain increased, &amp; I went to the ER on 3/21.  They diagnosed it as thrombophlebitis.  The pain &amp; inflammation  has continued  for 3 weeks now despite the use of anti-inflammatory meds &amp; support hose.  I have also had rapid weight gain of 12 lbs and edema not relieved by lasix.  Two weeks after the shot I also started having severe nose bleeds.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine  On 4/12 I started having a lot of pain overnight, especially the left side of my body. My left hip is hurting really bad, my left arm sometimes hurts. My back is also now hurting. Nothing I take alleviates the pain, I have tried Aleve, Tylenol and Ibuprofen. I am extremely fatigued both day and night now. My bones feel very painful even sometimes down to my feet. While most of my body hurts, the left side seems to hurt more than my right side. When I got the vaccine I felt very &#34;out of body&#34; if that makes any sense, but now I feel very off. I also seem to be bruising easier than I used to before as well.

                                                I received the vaccine at approx 930 am, Wed, March 17 (Johnson and Johnson Lot 1805020) at the Facility by Fireman(Emergency Responders). Vaccine was from Health Care. At first, after about 15 minutes I was feeling a little flush, there were light red splotches on my skin (only a couple, very light red - like when i get really nervous and get red splotches on my neck.) I felt a little nauseous and dizzy off an on for about an hour (but i had not had anything to eat or drink yet that day either). The site of the shot was a little sore and warm about an inch or two away from the needle injection site, but not a big deal. That night my right arm (which is where i received the shot) ached terribly, all the way from my shoulder to my fingers. The next day (Thursday, March 18) was the same. Sometimes my left arm tingled like it was starting to fall asleep. This went on the whole next day. Injection site still sore too, and warm.  The day after that (Friday, March 19) the injection site was sore (like a sore muscle) and that was it. Saturday, March 20, the same until about midnight. Around midnight my son, and I came upstairs from watching tv and my arm (at my wrist) was aching intensly! I looked down and there was a small lump where one if the veins are. I can see my veins easily here and I am very light-skinned. Son could also see the lump. My arm kept aching so badly! I was messaging the lump over and over. After about 5-10 minutes it went down a little bit, ached a little less, and i left it alone. The next day it looked like i had a bruise on my wrist and hand (where the meaty part of your hand is  going to the thumb. The next day, Sunday, March 20th, a neighbor said it could be a blood clot and i took an aspirin.    Today, Wednesday, April 14, 2021.   Approx 1130am, after getting out of bed, getting some coffee. I was sitting at my desk in my home office, took my medication and took my first sip of coffee. All of a sudden, my chest starting hurting. I cant say where the pain originated, it was in the chest/upper stomach area. It ached a lot, I felt very flush, I honestly cant remember if it were hard to breath, all i could think is &#34;what is this?&#34;. I didn&#39;t know if i would throw up, burp, pass out. the aches starting migrating, still saying in the chest, but expanding to my lower back. I got out of my chair and tried to move around...it took a good 3-5 minutes before it started to dissipate and I took another aspirin.

                                                Approximately 30 minutes after the injection I developed a significant headache and nausea.    Approximately one hour later if I was in the sun I became overheated, flush and an overall feeling of nervousness,  I adapted to these symptoms knowing they would considered normal but I no longer feel these should be considered normal.  Around 7pm on Monday I started running a fever that started at 101.1.  Between Monday night and Thursday morning it bounced around but stayed between 101.1 and 103.2.  It did not go away completely until Thursday morning.  At least I hope it is gone for good.  On Wednesday around 10am I developed abdominal pain that by 4pm had me sitting by my car unable to continue for about 10 minutes.  It was extremely stressful and still to the time of this report is still has not completely gone away.  The most concerning for me is the back pain with it.  At the time of this report I still have a headache, nausea, abdominal pain with back pain and vertigo.  I have contacted my doctor&#39;s office and they have made notes but suggested I report everything here.  They have started me on baby aspirin and electrolytes as I am also experiencing interment diarrhea.

                                                The first side effect I noticed was hives on the arm of the injection site as well as the arm being painful. I became light headed and very tired after the first hour of getting the vaccine. As the evening progressed I begin to get chills and a fever. My body ached from head to toe. I was nauseous and achy all over.  I was feeling sick for the next 24 hours, I stayed in bed and could barley move because my body ached so bad. I had a extreme head ache as well.  By the 3rd day I felt much better and only had pain in the arm of the injection site. After day 10 I noticed a lump near my collar bone and assumed based on web searching that it may be a swollen lymph node.  It&#39;s day 12 and I still have a little tenderness near the injection site and my lymph node is still swollen.

Symptoms included fever, chills, fatigue, soreness, abdominal and back pain, and headaches. I was hospitalized for four days, and on IV antibiotics for three of those days, followed by two weeks of oral antibiotics.

                                                Not too many adverse symptoms the day of and after vaccine... tired at times and sensitivity to light but continued to eat and helped w energy.   Also, warm left side of neck and slight red rash.  Not expecting to have leg pain in my calf 6 days later then moved to quad muscle and entire left leg felt achy.  CDC at this point said to check out any leg pain.  Pain was not severe but bothersome... had STAT ultra sound at ER on day 7, turned out negative for blood clots.  Returned to my physicians office day 8... still not feeling right with more of a rash on left side of neck and warm to the touch. Tired and slightly light headed and slight pain in left upper chest.  Digestion not the best starting day 5 thru 10.  Blood test returned normal for platelet levels but low eosinophils... either allergies or body is fighting the vaccine and creating antibodies (most likely).  No known allergies besides maybe skin reaction to Timothy Bluegrass.  Moderate headache day 9 and 10 which made me more fatigued (pain on both sides of head above ears and temples)... normally I do not get headaches.  Also, loss of appetite or feeling slight nauseous on day 8, 9, and 10 after the vaccine.   Now on day 11 and 12.. feeling better but still not quite right.  Lightheaded and feeling fullness in head but more energy than day 9 and 10 by far.  Never heard of people having symptoms after day 1 or 2 of the vaccine, so obviously I think this should be more documented for patients especially after blood clotting as a possibility 6 days after the vaccine.

I contacted a friend doctor stated that doesn&#39;t sound right might be a blood clotting issue.  I went for a visit on 4/13 in the clinic doctor said it seem ok. I was also exp nausea, headache and pain lower left leg. I went to the hospital on 4/14 had Blood Work, Ultrasound (legs) tests results was fine. Also still exp inflammation feeling in my legs a if I have lifted weights and tightness in my calves. I couldn&#39;t walk exp muscular pain, stiffness  between 4/14-/4/16. I normally have my menstrual 3-4 days for some reason it started over again on 4/10 for 10 days. I&#39;m not sure if this was some sort of hormonal reaction. My normal daily activities have been limited I usually walk every morning with my husband since vaccine not able.As of 4/19 my headache is gone the pain is not as bad in legs.

                                                I had nausea and generalized malaise, body aches and pretty intense swelling about 6 inches, distal at the vaccination site.  I put ice, massaged it and tried to break it up. I talked to my doctor who recommended me to apply light pressure massage. These symptoms lasted for 1-2 days.  My left arm is still sore but doing better.  I feel anxious due to the side effects the J&amp;J vaccine is having.   I do not have the lot # with me at the moment.

                                                I began to experience GI issues on an unknown date after receiving the vaccine.  I began to have indigestion, and acid reflux.  At times I was nauseous with vomit coming up into my mouth especially while sleeping.  As a result I began to take Pepcid Complete and/or tums and frequently slept sitting up.  This resolved itself on 3/30/21.  I saw my new primary care on 3/31/21 who then reported that I was experiencing high blood pressure even though I usually have good blood pressure.  I began to keep a log of my blood pressure which was consistently high.  About this time I began to experience localized pressure on my left chest which resulted my shallow breathing to try to minimize anything affecting the pressure.  I

Pain, heat induration, redness and itching at injection site.  Itching from injection site moving up arm to neck, side of face and hair.  Itching to inside of mouth and lips.  Feeling of heaviness and weakness to arms and legs.  Chest heaviness and increased work of breathing.  I wasn?t breathing faster, but I was aware of the fact that I had to work harder to breath.  As I said, these symptoms occurred over three days.  The Friday I went to the ED at Hospital.  I arrived around 14:45 and I think it was somewhere around 20:30 when I left.

I was sweating and vomiting.  My husband carried me to the car and brought me to the ER. At the Er I was given a patch for my back pain, medicine for the dizziness and nausea. The dizziness didn&#39;t subside. I couldn&#39;t walk. I told them I had gotten the vaccine two weeks before and they said it wasn&#39;t related. I was diagnosed with a bladder infection, high blood sugar, and vertigo. I was discharged in the evening but with no improvement.  I was not able to focus or walk for days. I saw my OBGYN, he was the only doctor I could see right away and he referred me to an ENT. The ENT can&#39;t see me until the end of June.  I wasn&#39;t able to drive for weeks. I am slowly regaining my balance but still feel waves of dizziness and my eyes can&#39;t focus well when I am reading. The back pain is gone. My OBGYN also doesn&#39;t feel the dizziness is related.

She was also getting hot and cold flashes along with sweating. She did not have a thermometer to check for a fever. I recommended patient take some Tylenol every 6 to 8 hours until fever-like symptoms resolve as well as stay well hydrated. I also recommended that patient call her doctor if symptoms don&#39;t resolve within 24 to 48 hours.

Overnight I was unable to sleep. About 5a.m.  I was incredibly nauseous. I was incredibly weak. I didn&#39;t have the strength to stand or sit upright.  I sat on the bathroom floor &amp; had to have someone prop me up in front of the commode to vomit into it I was so weak. I repeatedly vomited forcefully for about an hour with accompanying repeated bowel movements. I had a fever.I broke out in a sweat repeatedly - clammy. The most painful part as SEVERE, SHARP NON-STOP ABDOMINAL CRAMPING. I was in the fetal position on the floor writhing in pain after the vomiting &amp; bowel movements slowed. After hours of this... my clamminess turned into chills with my entire body shaking strongly &amp; continuously as I lay on the floor unable to do anything but shiver. I considered going to the emergency room but was able to move in my current state. Who &amp; where should I report this severe adverse event?  Note:  I&#39;m a 45-year old VERY physically fit athletic female.   My only health condition:  I take Enbrel for Rheumatoid Arthritis.

I took more Benadryl, drank some fluids. By 4:15, I was getting drowsy and tired, having pain in multiple joints through my body; 8/10 scale, especially in my hands in feet. I took something for pain. My arm was very sore. I had mild to moderate slight cough. By 7:40 PM I took my regular medication.  I was having a sudden intense HA and pain in joints was 9/10. I was having stiffness, chest congestion, feeling &#39;flu like&#39; symptoms, brain fog, and weird pains / electro shock pains on extremities. By 830, my symptoms increased to almost a really bad allergic reaction. I couldn&#39;t think well, dizzy, cough, chest congestion and my lungs started to hurt.

But it was pretty tough.

I was told to follow up with a cardiologist, I haven&#39;t done this yet. I am not sure if this is from the shot or not.

During the fever I was dizzy but not as bad as a Vertigo feeling. (I experienced Vertigo 17 years ago - postpartum.). I also experienced slight stomach pains during this time. 5/8 starting on this day going forward for 2 weeks I experienced headaches, which came on in the evenings, just after work.  From around 4pm till 8pm I was in bed daily with headaches.   I usually do not get headaches unless................  unless it is my period times.   During this 2 weeks I also added 5 lbs of weight, which I believe is water weight.    Lately I have consistently been 125 lbs (up from 120lbs since I was a teenager) and I went to 130 lbs in 2 weeks.  I feel as I am retaining water weight.  Pain in my legs attest to the weight.   The headaches ended for a few days and returned yesterday afternoon.   I can tell my body is trying to fight this Covid-19 shot.  I am hopeful these body changes will subside, weight gain and headaches overtime.    Also, during the first 2 weeks after the shot I also experienced vision blurriness.  This has since gone away and my vision has been self corrected.  I have not gone to the doctors as I viewed all of this associated with the vaccine and normally I am a healthy 45 year old woman otherwise.  I haven&#39;t needed to see a doctor in over a year.   If these headaches and body aches/weight gain continues I will be at the doctors for help.  I figured I would give it time to enter and exit my body first.  Ibuprofen sometimes worked to lessen the headaches, but not always.  You can email me any further questions you have.  Thank you.

                                                Received shot around 3:15pm. A few minutes later the area around the injection site got really hot and painful, and then I started getting really hot from the abdomen up to my chest neck and face. I called out for the nurse who came in to check on me and I almost fainted. I stayed at the facility for almost an hour until I was able to leave. I was not anxious or faint feeling before the shot so anxiety did not cause this. Once at home I was really tired. Today, July 13, I have had a fever, muscle aches, chills, headache, stomach issues, and a random numbness and tingling in my lower left leg that I?ve never had before.

                                                Around four hours later began with a head, heart beat really fast, small fever, extreme nausea and IBS-like symptoms (gas pains and diarrhea), fatigue. The later lasted for nearly a week, but the rest were gone by day 3. I did not see a dr as my fever never got very high and only occurred the first night. The nausea last maybe a day and a half. I am about two weeks out and I seem to be having a gluten skin reaction (dermatitis herpetiformis) and given most of the symptoms I listed could also be celiac symptoms, I was curious if there was gluten in the shot as it was very much like an extreme reaction to gluten that I normally get with celiac. I usually see gluten rashes a couple of weeks to a month after being exposed and I was not exposed to anything during the last few weeks that could be causing it (that I know of). The nurse who gave me the shot did not know if there was gluten in the shot. Hence, I know the first symptoms were definitely related to the shot, but not if the current rash is from the shot (because gluten, this is definitely DH and not an allergy rash). I hope this helps, if other celiacs have also had a hard time.

Fingertips still feel like electricity is running through them and fingers/hands still hurt; extremely hungry/thirsty from 03/25/2021 - 03/29/2021; fatigue, pain at base of skull under ears, tinnitus extremely loud and both ears feel like ear ache; During the night of my high fever, lower back where kidneys are started hurting very badly.  What is still left of that pain on day 5 is a pain radiating from my lower back down my right leg many times throughout the day (treating with ibuphrophen).   Pain around knees, elbows, ankles, and bottom of feet- different than joint pain.  All my POTS symptoms are in high gear (tachycardias, very low BP,  pain, dizzy, vertigo).    If the leg/lower back pain, and left arm problems continue, I will see my neurologist or immunologist.  I have reached out to both to make them aware.  My husband had the JJ shot same day, same place and had zero side affects.

                                                I was directed to my seat (if walking into the room, the first table but the 2nd seat).  The woman was learning the computer system from a gentleman, and she assured me she just didn&#39;t know the computer, but knew how to give a shot.  I pulled my arm out of my sweatshirt and pushed my short sleeve shirt up.  She did the alcohol wipe, then pinched my arm, I looked away as the shot went in.  I felt a horrible pain...not even sure how to describe it, just extreme pain and very achy and said Ow maybe 3 times (I am one that can tolerate quite a bit of pain, and I assumed it would sting, but this was different) as she was injecting me.  She apologized. The gentleman said Johnson and Johnson is a little thicker.  I said to him that I had never ever experienced this much pain with a vaccine before-never.  Again, I am talking about as it was injected. I went to sit down for the waiting area, the gentleman who was handing out cards for reviews asked me about it and I said it hurt so bad, I&#39;d never had a shot hurt that bad.  Another worker (female) overheard me and asked me if it was a burning-she had a burning with hers (think she said moderna). I said I would not necessarily say it was a burning, it was pain. As I sat there, I texted my husband and told him how bad it hurt (with the injection) and I&#39;ve never had a vaccine hurt like that.  I started to wonder if it was administered incorrectly? I looked over and the gentleman was now doing the vaccines and she was watching. My husband had Pfizer and he said that didn&#39;t hurt at all. I was feeling it up into my neck as I was sitting there. I was trying to rub my arm and neck hoping that would help as well as move my arm around. When we could leave, I asked the volunteer if she had heard of anyone else having that much pain DURING the shot.  She said she only heard of maybe one other person that said ow. I left, started to cry in the car because of the pain and experience, then spoke with my husband before I left. I came home and got some ice to put on my arm hoping that would help. I did expect pain in the arm after a shot. Within a couple of hours, I noticed pain going down my arm and into my wrist. I thought maybe I needed to be active with my arm and move it so tried that.  I started to notice more side effects of the vaccine as the evening progressed:  I had the typical side effects I figured I&#39;d have, achy, joint pain, chills, nauseous, no fever though. I was noticing pain into my neck (occasionally even into jaw), shoulder, scapula area of the back, and left side under the bottom part of my ribs.  I was feeling tightness in my chest, too, so I decided to try 2 aspirin to see if it helped with any symptoms. I did have slight dizziness, and a weird sensation in my head-like a zapping? I didn&#39;t sleep well, and had to stay completely off of my left side. Thursday, I felt better than that night, but still tired, achy, nauseous, chills, and not 100%.  My arm still was really affected...it seemed extremely fatigued as well as painful...the pain was radiating up and down and couldn&#39;t raise my arm without it hurting. Around noon I decided to take 2 aleve to see if that would help me at all. It did help with the pain and achiness, but was getting a &#34;nerve-type&#34; pain still up and down my left arm into neck/scapula area down to my wrist and hand/fingers. Still couldn&#39;t sleep on my left side. Friday, I was definitely doing better with all the other symptoms, I could abduct my arm more than 90 degrees, so I was excited about that. I did wake up with my middle/ring finger hurting (at the base of that area) and a bit numb so put my hand in and out of a fist. The pain subsided, but the numbness/tingling sensation was still there. I continued to take aleve hoping that maybe there was just inflammation around the nerve causing the issue.  Aleve did help, but it still never went away completely.  By late afternoon, I was getting concerned if I was permanently affected by this. As I was holding a bowl of food and eating, my left arm was going numb. I was even feeling it into my gluts (sciatica?). Again...all of this was after the shot and only on the side I received the shot. That evening I was able to lay on my left side, but not for long periods of time because it became uncomfortable and arm would go numb. Saturday, I still had the nerve pain and was not in a good spot.  It made me sad, angry, scared, and I didn&#39;t want to talk about it too much-just wanted my arm and all the different radiating pains I was having to be back to normal. I was feeling it up into my neck, scapula, my side(the rib area I previously mentioned), even into my gluts and down leg near ankle as well as down the arm into elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand, fingers (particularly that middle finger and thumb area).  I tried to use my arm as normally as possible thinking maybe I need to just keep it moving, but it would fatigue, especially between shoulder and neck. I tried Ibuprofen on this day.  Again, the pain relievers helped some, but didn&#39;t take it all away. Sunday I was in a horrible spot mentally and crying throughout the day because of the sensations I was feeling still: up and down the arm, shoulder, neck, scapula, side and still into ankle area. I decided I would call my doctor on Monday. Monday, I woke up and was feeling better overall, but still having the nerve sensations down my arm as well as up into shoulder, neck, scapula and my left side.  But everything was not as intense.  I spoke to my doctor who said there was a protocol, a number I needed to call.  Monday night I took ibuprofen because I started to have a horrible headache-didn&#39;t go away completely and still have this morning-not sure if it&#39;s related or just a normal headache. Still feeling tingling nerve sensations into forearm and fingers.  My shoulder/neck area feels fatigued, but so far not noticing the nerve pain yet, so that&#39;s a positive. On Monday,  it seemed to get worse as the day went on, so we will see. I definitely feel in hand/wrist/fingers as I am typing now. I know this is a lot, and I think I&#39;ve captured it.  Again, I had none of this pre-shot.  The pain during injection is what alarmed me most as I expected side effects after the shot, but not this nerve type issue.  For this to be lasting as long as it is concerns me, and the fact that it exhibits on my left side where I got the shot. I am very anxious as it hasn&#39;t gotten back to normal.

Also low grade fever with sweats and mild sore throat.  Arm was mildly sore at injection site for several days.  Headache and fatigue continued for three full days. On 5th and 6th day after vaccine, had diarrhea.  Was told by doctor at vaccine event not to take any anti-inflammatories for 3 to 5 days.  He said Tylenol was ok.  Took Tylenol day after vaccine when adverse effects were the worst and it did not help at all.  Finally took Advil on day 4 and it relieved headache.  Now 7 days after vaccine still have intermittent headache.

                                                I received the vaccine on March 27, 2021. Seconds after the injection was completed my vision went blurry, but it only lasted a few seconds. On March 28, 2021 I felt like my body was going to explode. My blood in the back of my head was thumping. I tried to take a nap to calm my body down but my body felt comp!eye unrest and thumping. My urine made the whole inside of the toilet water look like a white thick cloud.  I have never seen my urine look like that in my life. I used my husbands blood pressure monitor and my blood pressure was 152/104!  I arrived at urgent care about 5:30 PM. They gave me a blood pressure pill. I have never had a blood pressure pill my entire life. They also took a urine sample since I told them about the my very strange looking urine. They found protein and blood in my urine. The culture days later showed no infection. I am still having issues with the high blood pressure.

I took two Advil&#39;s and went down to 100. Around 10am the next morning it broke. I went to see my Doctor thought that my immune system over reacted to the vaccine as I haven&#39;t been out in a year or been sick, she wasn&#39;t too concerned about it. I&#39;ve had some stomach issues- mild diarrhea and stomach pain. Not sure it has to do with the vaccine.

NO FEVER but major body aches and soreness. AFter the chills wore off I was in a sweat..this pattern of chills, vs soaking sweats continued throughout the night. Add to that dry heaves due to nausea but no vomiting. The dry heaves just added to the muscle pains that I already had. I was in bed until 5 pm the next day, no energy, sore body aches to the point that my skin hurt. still no soreness in my arm at all. I finally had the strength to get out of bed at 5pm took a shower and ate 2 pieces of toast to combat the nausea. Fast forward next day, felt fine and arm was mildly sore at injection sight. SO glad J and J is only one dose.. I would have dreaded a second day like that.

Dizziness lasted for a few minutes which created nausea. Sat at site for approximately 25 minutes after shot. Left arm was sore between shoulder and elbow, which was to be expected. Later in the evening, experienced fatigue. When trying to go to bed around 11pm,  my left are was throbbing. I did take Tylenol at about 6pm. Throughout the AM hours, sever body aches started, extreme fatigue throughout the following day. Flu like symptoms continued the next day.  I had heard of these symptoms for the other shots but not for Johnson and Johnson. Hungry but too weak to actually cook.

                                                I received the vaccine at approximately 1:08 pm.  Once administered I was instructed to sit in the auditorium for 15 minutes for observation.  During that time I had a few heartrate increases and nausea but nothing out of the ordinary or concerning.  After the 15 minutes, I walked out to my car and thankfully my husband had driven because what happened next would have caused an accident.  Our drive home is approximately 20 minutes from where vaccine was administered.  In the car I began to feel a tingling all over my body that gradually began to feel like ?pins and needles? (like when you sit on your legs for too long and they ?fall asleep?), with the worst of the feeling being in both of my hands. I began opening and closing my fingers to try and get them to feel normal.  By the time we pulled into the driveway, my hand had locked up in a weird position and I was no longer able to communicate with them and make them move.  They were temporarily paralyzed.  My husband opened the door for me because I wasn?t capable of doing so.  Once I stepped out of the car, my body began to convulse and shake.  We stood there for a few minutes because one, I couldn?t make my body cooperate and two, we didn?t want our children seeing me that way.  My husband kept asking me if he should call an ambulance.  Of course, he should have but I think he was so scared and shocked that he just didn?t know how to react.  I had trouble forming words and sentences at that point and could not tell him to call. I felt pretty calm considering what was happening to me and I could not control myself.  My husband decided to walk away from me and coerce me to go to him.  I stood there for a few minutes trying to communicate with my legs.  Once I took my first step, my body stopped shaking and I started to regain feeling in my hands.  I went and laid down for a bit and began to feel a bit better.  Around 7pm I was feeling extremely cold.  So cold that I put on three layers of clothing and two comforters to try and warm myself.  That did not work though, as it was more of a cold from nerve endings than it was from temperature.  I went to bed around 9pm but didn?t fall asleep until around midnight.  I was feeling waves of cold down my body. Like a skin prickling when you hear a beautiful song and you get goosebumps and your hairs stand up.  I woke around 3am to an extreme headache and a fever of 102.6.  I took Tylenol and went back to bed.  When I woke in the morning, I felt better but had weird and random muscle twitching.  For the past few days I?ve been suffering with extreme fatigue which is not like me at all.  Even when I?m tired, I can still manage to function throughout the day.  Not only have I been tired, my body is weak, my muscles are weak and my joints hurt. I?m hoping this ends soon and doesn?t get any worse. It will be two weeks this Sunday.

The pain in my joints was around a 7 on pain scale. I could not get comfortable and was writhing from side to side. Around 2am I took a 2nd Hydrocodone for the pain. At 10am  I finally took Nurtec for the massive migraine.  At 11:30am (about 23 hours after injection) the headache was relieved, the joint pain had significantly decreased. My neck still ached. I was very fatigued and it was with effort to move from the bed to the couch. I slept on and off throughout the remainder of the day.  I had no appetite but forced myself to eat yogurt with fruit. It is now 11:44am Sunday. I still have no appetite. With exception of some mild fatigue and loss of appetite, all other symptoms have improved.

This lasted 2 days and I had stopped taking the antibiotic because I felt so ill from the shot. I then began vomiting. My entire body hurt it felt like every cell in my body was transforming and the pain was unreal I was so weak I couldn?t open a water bottle

                                                I am a runner and run regularly. On 3/23 I was running with friends early in the morning and got a strange cramp in my left calf. I?ve never had that happen before. It was so strong that I had to stop running and walk the last mile home. The strange cramp/pain lasted about 4 days.  Then last week my family and I were skiing and I got a sharp pain in the shin of my left calf.  Nothing brought it on, it was intense and just started out of nowhere. The pain lasted about 10 minutes and then subsided. It was very strange. That night I had a large bruise. The next morning the bruise was the size of the palm of my hand. The bruise was gone after about 4 days. I don?t know if these are related but I?ve never experienced things like these in the past without something causing them.  So after hearing reports of adverse reactions these seemed worthwhile to report.  As a side note, I also did get sick during the 24 hours after my shot. My symptoms included intense body aches, headache, sinus pain, sore throat, fatigue, nausea and a fever of 102.4. These symptoms all subsided after 48 hours of my vaccination.

By 4 pm I had a fever of 100.7, really bad shaking chills, body aches, and nausea. My chills went away by the next day. My fever, bad headache, and ringing ears continued. My fever reached 101 but never went over. It lasted until Sunday evening. It has been 2 weeks and 1 day and my headache has never gone away, though it is manageable and mild now, although it was really bad last night. My ears/head continue to ring non-stop. Nothing helps with that.

                                                About 5 minutes after I received the shot, had a sudden burning sensation in the middle of my chest that radiated out. I thought that was it for me. Nausea, dizziness, numbness in my left cheek and arm, got a funny taste in my mouth. This got pretty intense and lasted about 10 minutes. They had me stay in observation for another 45 minutes as those symptoms came in waves but never as intense as the first time. They let me go and I went home to rest. On the way home my cheeks became flushed and it felt like my eyes and cheeks were swelling. I had a lot of other symptoms over the next several hours which I wrote down. Early Tuesday morning those symptoms went away and I was left with some flu like symptoms, dizziness and a brain fog like I have never had before.

My chin also swelled up really big and I had hard time breathing. I went to the ER due to my throat swelling up and my difficulty to breathe for three days straight and also felt a pressure sensation in my throat and chest.  At the ER they performed lab work, gave me a Toradol injection and also gave me steroids. I also took a homeopathic remedy which was given to me by a friend who is a doctor and my symptoms started to get better.   On another note, my sister also had the J&amp;J vaccine and she also had nausea symptoms but only lasted 3-4 days but I do not know if this is a genetic component.

It has now been 5 days and she is still having this pain with any movement of the body.  If she is resting and sitting still, she is fine.

                                                flu like symptoms with headache 4/8/21. Chest pain, nausea, sweating, lightheadedness  started 4/10/21, was seen in ER and discharged home. White count was noted as 2.8. Chest pain went away after 24 hours and palpitations started 4/11/21, severe at times for several hours at a time. Saw my cardiologist on 4/15/21 for severe palpitations and he ordered a halter monitor to be worn for 2 weeks. I stated  to him that I felt like I was in SVT, or something stronger than just palpitations. This continued for several hours a day from 4/11/21 to 4/24/21, when I was on the telemetry pack at work and went into an arrythmia that was later evaluated by my cardiologist as SVT and A FIB. On 4/25/21, I had mild &#34;palpitations&#34; but have not had any incidences since. I am now on metoprolol to control it and did not have a cardiac issue prior to receiving the vaccine.

                                                Stomach Pain. It was a constant pain after I was given the vaccine and it lasted about two weeks but they reappear every time I go running. I used to ran between 5 and 6 miles every day now I can barely run 2 miles every other day. The Stomach pain doesn&#39;t allowed me to continue. This never happened to me before. It starts after 15mins of my run and by min 23 I need to stop. The pain last for around 30 mins and then it is gone. If I try to start running again the pain comes back stronger than before.

                                                It probably is my thyroid, I have hypothyroidism, which is an autoimmune disorder, they are still trying to figure it out. My thyroid went really high. High thyroid can cause heart problems, fatigue, all that kind of things. They are trying to lower my medications. On 06/17/2021 I went to the doctor. They did blood work, CAT scan, heart normal, Covid test. I had to be hospitalized for 3 days and 2 nights at medical center because I had chest pain and shortness of breath and heart palpitations.  While at the hospital they gave me nitroglycerin for the chest pain and Zofran for the nausea.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Six hours after the vaccination I experienced an upset stomach, fever, chills, terrible body aches, headache, and sluggishness.  I only had children?s Tylenol so I took that but it did not treat the symptoms. Thirteen hours later I took extra strength Tylenol and that helped with the treatment of most of the symptoms. About eighteen hours later I started to feel better. I had residual hot flashes 48 hours later.

It felt like my bones were made out of glass and someone had taken a hammer to my bones.  My face was swollen and red.  Unable to sit up.  Walk from bed to toilet only.  Overall, I would say extreme flu-like symptoms.  Temperature 99.6 all day.   I could not take the pain any further at 4:20 pm and took 1,000 mg of Tylenol.  I finally fell asleep and woke up at 8:30pm and could walk again and my fever had broken.  I still don&#39;t feel great, but I think the worst is behind me.

                                                March 23 about 7pm I started with stomach upset, then had body aches and then had a migraine start about 10pm.   Went to the ER the next day to be treated for the stomach upset and migraine. Found out I had a fever of 101 degrees. Was treated with a few medications. Migraine subsided a little bit and then I was sent home. It is now almost 48 hours post-covid vaccine and I still have a headache.

                                                Started with a cramp feeling next to my left shoulder blade, Then the feeling moved up my left side of my neck (like I had slept wrong) and began giving me a headache. Because of this, I was getting nauseous and fever spikes. Then about 3:30am, I had water like diarrhea. After that, I started to feel dizzy (I was fine as long as I still) with cold chills along with being very tired.  When I got home, I took some Ibuprofen and took a nap (4 hour nap). Began to feel much better. When I woke up, I felt better but still had a stiffness in my shoulder blade area and left side neck.

                                                I started feeling nauseous right away, so I had to wait for 30 min. Later that night I started throwing up. I was sick for almost 3 days. I rested a lot because I couldn&#39;t move because I was so tired, achy, really cold and I threw up everything I happened. I waited to contact my doctor in hopes that it would go away, but I couldn&#39;t stop vomiting. By that Monday, I decided to get help. I was told to go to the hospital to get rehydrated. They did a CT Scan and they didn&#39;t find anything. I am waiting to follow up with my doctor since I am still throwing up.

                                                Moments after the vaccine my arm and hands started tingling and becoming numb in various spots which continued all over my entire face.  I was monitored and was given a shot of benedryl and was sent home after a while.   The next day I felt really groggy, latargic and had diarreah.  That monday the numbness went up to my ear and I reached out to my PCP who prescribed a steroid.   Later that evening I got a really bad headache and the tingling and numbness hit my feet then went up my legs, my arms and up and down my body.  Its a feeling as if my body has fallen asleep.

                                                Around five hours after shot I felt what I would describe as brain fog and light headache, by the evening I was aching, chilling and had 101 fever. Aches in my muscles and joints as if I had Rocky mountain spotted fever again. That is what the side effects reminded me of. This went on for over 48 hours. I have never been so sick. Very nauseous by next day. Also fell to the floor from nearly passing out the following morning. Took a minute for the light headed To pass. Arm pain still today. It was very scary and seemed to be a very serious reaction. Friday after noon finally started feeling better. The other strange part of this is that my daughter and best friend and I received the shot together in the same lot number and every one of us was deathly ill with the same symptoms. I am the only one with the fainting spells. Still feel fatigued today. And shoulders and left arm injection site still sore and achy.

Within approx. 30 minutes, I was having extreme chills, some slight stomach cramping, and the neck/upper back aches became very intense. It felt like a case of the flu, but worse. I did not experience vomiting. I took 600mg of Ibuprofin at about 10:00pm Those symptoms ended at approx. 12:30am on 4/8/2021. I was quite exhausted all day on 4/8/2021. Throughout the day on 4/8/2021, I felt lightheaded and a bit dizzy. That symptom lasted for just that day only. I continued to feel tired through 4/9/2021. I now feel completely recovered.

                                                Weirdly despite a right arm injection - left arm ache and left thigh muscle spasms started a few hours afterwards. At 7pm heavy sweat and slight fever. During course of evening nausea, neck, shoulders and lower jaw severe ache by morning. Small sores (the little bubble kind) similiar to mild food allergy broke out on inside bottom lip only and passed only when soreness left lower jaw near late afternoon. Felt better by 5pm. Slight muscle aches in left arm, shoulders &amp; tiredness remained through following day April 2. As of today, 4/12 - I&#39;m having the heavy flow menstral cycle of a freaking teenager. Not fun. I&#39;m accustomed to a very light period at my age not the uteras ripping heavy flow of those first 20 years. Hoping this is a one time deal.

Shortly after severe pain started, tremors/teeth chattering chills even under seven heavy blankets, lasted for hours. Headache (which had been there since 6 hrs after vaccination). Pain was so severe that I was getting ready to go to ER and then vomited. Felt a tad better only to vomit again three hours later, body in a pool of sweat but no fever. Aches, tingling hot prickly sensation running from toes to head, almost passed out. Diarreah every hour after second vomit, stomach pain started to subside then but never went away completely until 3 days after.

Saturday night/Sunday -- not 100%, no appetite, intermittent nausea, but able to work/do normal activities. Monday 4/5--nausea at an 8-9 in the morning and kept a trash can next to me during virtual hearings I had that day.   Intermittent nausea throughout the week and not much appetite but made sure I was eating/drinking despite that.   Wednesday night 4/7 -- I went to use a PT stick on my left leg b/c I had felt a little pain in my left knee and figured my quadriceps were fibrotic.  I could barely put any pressure on my left thigh. I had never experienced anything like this.  As soon as I started rolling the stick on my leg, my skin was immediately red and warm and my leg was so sore and tender I had to stop.   Saturday 4/10 -- woke up with severe headache and later that morning felt very weird in my head/heart, like heart racing and my head felt &#34;spinny.&#34;  Felt like I might pass out at one point so I had one of my kids sit on my bed with me until I felt a little better. Sunday 4/11 -- had another episode like Saturday (headache and lightheaded/spinny/pass out feeling/slow speech) and asked neighbor (an RN) to take my BP.  her at-home device said 147 over something and she suggested I go to urgent care just to double check.   About three hours later, I was seen at  urgent care.  BP was normal, heart rate normal, oxygen was 96.  4/13--followed up with primary doctor.  Send me for blood work to check platelets, etc.  Feeling pretty good today but nervous after the news and the pause.

                                                Initial symptoms was exhaustion and nausea around 12:00 pm. .  Headache, chills and trouble breathing followed.  Symptoms worsened as the day progressed.  I triggered a high heart rate alarm on my watch while sitting and dozing about 6:00 pm.   I ended up in bed at 6:30 that night and slept off and on with fever, chills, headache and throbbing arm pain until 7:00 am 4/9/2021.  I had to use my inhaler during the night to help breathe but do not remember the time.  The next day I was much better with the exception of tiredness, nausea and headache throughout most the day.  I have pretty much fully recovered on Saturday 4/10/2021 with only tiredness continuing to bother me as of the this report.  I am sleeping more than usual.        I did not notify the clinic of my reaction as they were closed over the weekend.

While laying down  and as time progressed, my head started aching very bad, my arm that received the shot started hurting,  I had chills, joint pain, it hurt to touch my skin, off balance when trying to walk,  some nausea but I could eat some, I felt  pen sensation poking areas in legs but mostly my abdominal area. Overall a feeling of ratchetness,  pain, and misery.  Next morning I woke with the headache  and sore arm but I felt MUCH better. By Monday, all I had was sore arm and slight headache. Now, today, Tuesday, I have small headache, some coughing, sore forearm and thigh (really weird because this just started). Overall I feel good and I am glad that Saturday is over!

                                                Headache and general tiredness began 30-45 min after shot.  Muscle soreness (injection site, rib muscles, leg muscles, back muscles and neck muscles) began soon after.  By 6pm, muscles had become painful.  I had chills but no measurable fever.  I got in the bed but unable to sleep due to muscle pain and discomfort.  Hip joints and back began to ache.  Fever and chills worsened over the next several hours to measurable with highest at 102F.  I took 1000mg tylenol generic which did not lower fever but fever did not rise higher.  Throughout the night, I experienced calf muscle cramps and foot cramps, stomach pains, joint pains, inability to sleep, worsening injection site soreness and armpit soreness (likely lymph node soreness).  Once in middle of night I may have felt chest tightness but I even doubted that I really experienced it as I had been thinking about all the AEs I was experiencing.  Symptoms continued through night.  Next morning, developed a cough so I made appointment to get a COVID exposure test at 1pm on 13th April because I had flown in plane on 10th April.   Cough could have been due to allergy type post-nasal drip because of high pollen in area.  By late Tue evening, I felt better.  Headache had resolved and muscle symptoms improved.  Now (3:45pm on 15th April) I am still experiencing lymph node/armpit soreness and general inability to focus, think clearly.  I feel like I am in a fog.  I emailed a message to my physician and reported this through VAERS

                                                About 4 days after I started having abdomen pain, it was like having contractions, then bleeding and spotting, and it was a different type of color instead of a period color, more burgundy. it lasted 26 days, when I&#39;d eat it would start again, I started having headaches, and had vision problems, then SOB started and I used the inhaler to help. I also had a low grade fever of 99.8 - 100 that lasted up until about 5 days ago. I started having bruising and leg pain, the bruising would be if someone helped me get up, I have little bruising dots over my body.  I went to the ER 3/16/2021 because the stomach and headache pains, they did a MRI and Ct and said it was acute stomach pain and migraines and told me to see a OBGYN for the bleeding and gave me meds for stomach pains. Bentel for stomach and Floraset for headaches but it never worked. I had a nerve block on my head for the migraines but it didn&#39;t work.  The GYN gave me something to stop the bleeding and she&#39;s wants to do a D&amp;C. I&#39;m waiting to see my PCP on the 19th.  I still have the purple dots and headaches, I still get the contractions and the stomach issues have settled some.

                                                Felt like mild flu at first - fatigue, headache, nausea. The nausea continued for a couple of weeks off and on and resulted in vomiting on 4-17-21. I vomit maybe once every few years. The nausea seemed to be slowly resolving, but I began feeling terrible the afternoon of 4-29-21. By 4-30, my feet began throbbing with stabbing pain, pain radiated up to knee in right leg. Entire body pain started, hurt to walk, started vomiting and diarrhea, with fever until 5-3. I still haven?t kept food in me. I used Aleve and Tylenol for fever, drank Pepto to attempt calming stomach, and used ice packs on my feet and a heating pad on stomach to try and decrease the cramping. Don?t know temp, thermometer battery was dead, but went between freezing cold sweating to burning up (dry hot and sweaty at other times).  I can?t attribute feeling like this to anything else and there?s no possibility of being pregnant.

No appetite at all.  I&#39;m coughing now - lingering. Felt burning when the injection was going in at the time of vaccine and I told her that it needed to be taken out right away. The administrator said the burning was the vaccine going in. It was on my left side, it&#39;s like when you get contrast in your body and it&#39;s warm-like sensation. It felt like on the inside of my left side of body - it was warm; pain. It felt funny - like it was burning. I noticed that my ankle (left) was getting red and then it was getting a little dark and getting darker. When I got home (about an hour or so later) - part of my foot to my lower part of my leg looked like it was burnt. Like a very ugly bruise and like a burn. That is still here. I have put aloe vera and cocoa butter on it but it&#39;s not going away.  I have photos I can upload. Have called my doctor because these symptoms haven&#39;t gone away - I talked to telehealth nurse and she said was normal. But then I called and made an appt with Primary care doctor and that appt is May 27th - upcoming.

Then at day 6 - Headache, gas, severe stomach pain, waves of nausea, muscle aches for 1 day, constant diarrhea every few hours.  Took Ibuprofen 800 mg, Celexacoxib with no real affect on headache.  Used calcium carbonate for stomach- no help at all.  Other than the muscle aches, all other symptoms are still present on day 3 (day 9 since injection) as I write this.

                                                When I woke up, I was shaking really bad. I was freezing. I had the chills. It was 101. I kept going to the bathroom that night - 7 times. My hands went completely numb - both of them. I felt like I was going to throw up but didn&#39;t at that time. I couldn&#39;t breathe. My chest was heavy and hurting. I had tons of blankets on but couldn&#39;t get warm and was up all night sick. I felt like I couldn&#39;t walk - I had  no strength to do anything. I had to hold on to things to get to the bathroom. I did throw up the next couple of days and I couldn&#39;t eat the next couple of days. I tried to call my doctor - and they told me take Advil/Tylenol for pain. They told to me to keep drinking even though I was throwing. I was throwing up for four days. My arm was sore for a week at least. My hands are still numb. This hasn&#39;t gone away since I&#39;ve gotten the shot. My bladder - I&#39;m in more pain from it - it&#39;s worse pain than my normal - it exacerbated it. I think something from the shot did something to make my immune system not work. I had a migraine for a month - really bad headaches for a month after. I had to keep taking migraine medicine and lay down. It knocked me off my feet. I am still having the bladder issues and the numbness in my hands.  I had called the doctor a second time but they didn&#39;t know what to do and only advised ER which I didn&#39;t do.

Based on visual exam of multiple, tiny water-filled blisters only on right side of thorax &#43; description of pressing pain in chest similar to feeling of a heart attack, both doctors on shift diagnosed shingles.  Forgot I received COVID vaccine 4 days before symptoms started so I never mentioned it to the doctor.  TRX= 800mg acyclovir 5x/day x 7 days.  Rash continued to get worse and spread more before finally subsiding and starting to crust over.  Nearly 3 weeks later, rash is now a combo of scabs and open wounds.  Pressing deep pain in right chest is persistent and only relieved partially with 800mg ibuprofen q 8 hours.

                                                Twelve days after the vaccine I got a severe headache with blurry vision. I was also short of breath and my legs were swollen. I was dizzy and had body aches mostly on my left side. My left kidney was inflamed. The pain went all the way on the left side of my body from my ribs to my legs. My left leg was the most swollen. Many of the symptoms lasted for two and a half weeks. The headache lasted for three days. The first week was the worst. When I went to the ER  after a week they did not find any blood clots. The aches pains and swelling in my legs came and went over the course of three weeks. I was very tired when the symptoms were present.

I reached out to my primary care physician, Dr.  and was advised to visit the ER if I didn&#39;t feel any better in a few days. Two days later, I went to the  Hospital ER in. I feel better but my energy levels are still low.

I just wanted to let you know that I experience mid back pain after the covid vaccine was administer on my left arm. it felt like a sharp pain but only in my mid back area. by the evening i got chills and also a fever which i took tylenol, i felt nauseous, my head felt like it was not attached to my body, i havent sleep anything in 2 days. I had a severe migraine and also vomiting but most of all is the spinning of y head like when people have vertigo. I havent been able to eat food because it comes out both ways, either i vomit or constant diarrhea. i made a call to my doctor waiting for her response. this symptos started around 6pm on 03/06/21 and still until today 03/08/21

Throughout the next day, Sunday, my fever subsided gradually, significant fatigue persisted as did loss of appetite.

Arm was sore but no more than any other vaccine. close to 4 hours later, headache started, felt hot and cold. Hard to sleep, sweating a lot during the night. Headache was so bad it felt like a combination of a bad flu with a hangover. felt very thirty. In the morning I was dizzy, hot, cold, temp 99.8, sick to my stomach, coudn&#39;t taste food very well, just like when you have the flu, nothing taste good. I spend the following day in and out of sleep, very tired, hard to focus. The sensation for being hot and cold continued. Took Imitrex to alleviate the headache/migraine . I did help, but not much. Hard to eat due to an upset stomach. Today is the first full day. I hope I&#39;m better tomorrow

                                                Within 3 hours of vaccination, headache, nausea, dizziness, extreme fatigue, felt like I was freezing - fever of 100.8 (normal for me is 97.4).    I couldn&#39;t stay awake for more than about 15 minutes at a time.   Medication taken was 400mg Aleve (Naproxen Sodium). Fever lasted through the night.  As of today (3/16/21) all other symptoms except nausea persist.  Headache comes and goes.  I can stay awake for longer periods of time, but if I get up for anything for any more than a few minutes, I feel weak and dizzy again.

All over body aches, no appetite, weakness, fatigue, headache, nasal congestion, burning eyes, ataxia, lightheadedness. Took my AM meds including hydrocodone-APAP which caused the fever to break but stayed low grade until the following afternoon around 2 PM. Helped with the body aches somewhat as well. Appetite started to return this morning, 3 days after the vaccine but the fatigue, weakness, muscular pain and a general unwell feeling continues.

When I got out of bed I was lightheaded and passed out in the bathroom as I was getting Tylenol.  I took 2 Tylenol and had diarrhea about 10 mins later.  I went to get some gatorade and passed out again in the hallway on the way to the kitchen.  About an hour after taking Tylenol symptoms began to improve but became nauseous and couldn&#39;t get back to sleep.  As of 2pm Sunday current symptoms are extreme nausea and extreme exhaustion.

                                                I got sick to my stomach an hour after getting the shot and it lasted all night. I didn?t have much appetited. I had vomiting and diarrhea for seven hours. I had hives about an hour and a half after the shot all over especially and my feet. The hives were extremely itchy, and my skin felt like it was on fire. The next morning, I went to urgent care and gave me an anti-itch medicine/antihistamine Hydroxyzine. The prescribed medicine knocked me out, but it only helped a little with the itching. The hives stayed for another four days. I have also had severe joint pain that is still lingering in my feet and hands. I don?t normally have joint pain, but it started the day after the shot.

                                                Approximately a half hour after the Janssen vaccine was administered on Monday, March 15, 2021 at 2:00pm, I felt a dull ache/sensation in the back, lower part of my head. No other symptoms that day. Today is Tuesday,  March 23 and I am still experiencing side effects from the vaccine. The side effects, other than the &#34;brain ache&#34; come and go. The side effects include what I can describe as a &#34;brain&#34; ache, some itching (3/16), random sweating, arms feeling like dead weight, overall general feeling sick, random body aches (don&#39;t last long), dragging of feet when walking, noises being louder than what they actually are, brain &#34;fog&#34;, dizziness, nausea, tingling in legs and feet .  What I describe as a &#34;brain ache is a different feeling than a headache or migraine.  It is as if my brain actually hurts. A very notable side effect that occurred on  Wednesday, March 17, was an episode of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. Throughout my life I have experienced AIWS  at bedtime.  On Wednesday, I experienced an episode during the day and it lasted for three hours.  My session is going to log me out.  I cannot type anymore.  Please contact me for more inforamtion.

Basically every muscle hurt and I really couldn&#39;t move.  I spent the entire day in bed unable to eat or even move. I had to take the day off from work.   I think I had Covid in Feb 2020 before testing began. The symptoms I felt in February 2020 were exactly the same beginning 12 hours after the vaccine.

At night I was shivering with fever of 100.6 - 101.3. I had such severe joint and muscle pain I could not lie down. I was so sleepy but had to get out of bed every 90 minutes or so and walk around because the pain was so bad. I was severely nauseated.

                                                Site of the injection started to burn as I sat in the waiting area.  The best way to describe the burning feeling in my arm  is the feeling of when you receive a local anesthetic or a nerve block at the dentist.  It lasted for 30 seconds to 1 minute .  I began to feel nauseous and hot, I broke into a sweat and called over someone as I felt like I was going to pass out.  All happened within the first 3 minutes in the waiting area.  I sat with the medics for a few minutes and I returned to normal.  I never lost consciousness.  I was able to leave after the 15 minutes.

                                                Went to bed at 11 pm, woke up with severe headache, chills, fever and leg pain. Pain in legs became increasingly worse throughout the early morning, from the waist down. Became nauseated, chilled and fevered with severe headache and leg pain until 04.07.2021. I took an 800 MG ibuprofen on 04.07.2021 which seemed to help decrease the deep cramping leg pain and eased the headache. I did not seek any treatment because I figured there would be some side effects from the vaccination. I am still experiencing slight chills, leg pain, tiredness, mild joint pain and moderate chest and head congestion.

                                                Headache started on 4/6/2021 hasn?t really gone away altogether just gotten less intense. On Saturday evening my right arm started to hurt from my bicep to my fingers. When I woke up Sunday morning I couldn?t move my arm without extreme muscle and nerve pain. I wasn?t able to make a fist or grip anything in my hand. It eased up throughout Sunday and by the evening it was fine. Also on Sunday morning I vomited twice and once in the evening. By the evening I also had diarrhea, which is still going on. I woke up Monday feeling sore all over had a fever of 101.9. The fever broke the same day. Throughout Monday and more so on Tuesday and today I am constantly itchy especially my fingers. It feels like I have things crawling on me. I called my pcp yesterday (Tuesday) gave them my symptoms told them I had been vaccinated on 4/6. They didn?t call me back until today (Wednesday) &amp; wouldn?t let me split the office fee in two so they wouldn?t see me. I also called the pharmacy on Tuesday  spoke to the pharmacist was advised what was going on is side effects and I needed to report it. The diarrhea and itchy feeling is keeping me from being able to work and I?m not sure what to do from here.

I was standing in my kitchen and all of the sudden I became dizzy, my heart rate shot up, I became very nauseous and my  entire body became sweaty and hot and every muscle in my body hurt. My husband also received the J&amp;J shot at the same time and day and at 11:45 pm (15 min after I got sick) he was abruptly woken up out of a dead sleep to find himself running to the bathroom with severe nausea and vomiting. He was very pale and very very dizzy, his heart rate was elevated and this lasted for about 24 hours for him. We are about 10 days out from getting the vaccine and I still have muscle pain in my legs.  All other symptoms lasted about 24 hours.

Swollen, aching eyeballs with eye muscle pain. Extremely dark circles below eyes. Headache and nausea. Continued for 36 hours and then went away. We thought we would let you know as there now is a hold on administering this vaccine.

If I had been home, I absolutely would have been laying down. My heart was also racing. I then felt cold all over. My experience lasted about 10 mins and probably 7 mins into it, I did start to feel better. The experience was quite scary. I thought I could have ended up in the hospital.

I had the temperature for a few hours and then I started feeling nauseous and threw up. I felt terrible the next day with a very bad headache and  five days later I developed a rash on my arms and legs.  It finally subsided but then reoccurred the next day.

Around 9:30pm, woke up (after about an hour) headache was really bad including stomachache, also I was shivering uncontrollably even though I felt like I was burning up. I took Tylenol around 5:30pm and 9:30pm. Later during the night, around 2am, my headache continued to be bad with stomachache and still feeling chilled. I took Motrin around then. That seemed to help enough for me to get some sleep. When I woke in the morning the headache was faded. The rest of the day I was tired, felt like I was recovering.

The next day woke up with a severe migraine (with its usual accompanying symptoms), lack of appetite, and body aches. Body aches particularly acute in areas where I have had past injuries and surgeries...indicating strong inflammatory response. No fever, but essentially felt like an intense case of the flu. Symptoms abated by 5 pm on 04/08/2021 after complete bed rest. Lethargy continued for the next few days, however, that is usual for me after a migraine on the higher end of the pain scale, and may not be a direct result of the vaccine itself.

When I woke up at 10:30 am Saturday my face was extremely swollen.  My left side seemed to be more swollen then my right side.  Called Dr. on Monday &amp; decided to wait a few days.  Also started to have diarrhea as well on Monday.  The swelling was better by Friday.  Also found that I was having trouble sleeping even though I was feeling extremely tired.  That Thursday I had an extreme burning in my stomach. Only way I can describe it is that it felt like there were flames in my stomach. The burning was so bad that it was making me extremely nauseous.  Friday the burning was better but the burning is still coming &amp;going but no where near as bad as the first time.  Please note that I stopped all vitamins &amp; supplements after I received the shot on Friday.  Im only still taking my adder all.

A month later when I was about to start my menstrual cycle I developed the same symptoms which have never happened during that time of the month. I would usually feel a little fatigue and general discomfort but this time I got really sick with chills, body ache, nausea, dizziness, just as I did immediately after the shot.  It may not be related but I just wanted to report it in case someone else had the same problem.  It was just strange that in all my years of having a cycle that has never happened before.

                                                I got the J&amp;J covid vaccine on 4/10/2021 at 11:40am.  Later on that day, my left arm was sore so I took Tylenol.  After my shower that night around 10pm, I felt cold/shaky/chills &amp; had really weird dreams.   The next morning (4/11/2021), I slept in late &amp; was very tired when I woke up.  I also had a headache, fever (100.2F) &amp; nausea. Took 2 Tylenol 500 mg each  &amp; these symptoms went away later that night.   Two days after the vaccine, on 4/12/2021, I woke up with itchy red rashes all over both of my legs &amp; feet (~30 small-med size). Took 2 doses of Zyrtec &amp; Benadryl 50mg twice that day so it wouldn?t itch so much. Also applied mometasone ointment to rashes.   On 4/13/2021, I did a video visit with a doctor.  She said my rashes were probably due to an immune response to the J&amp;J covid vaccine (meaning it is working) &amp; it didn?t look serious since it was only on my legs.  She said to continue the Zyrtec up to 2x/day, Benadryl every 6 hrs if needed, &amp; apply mometasone steroid ointment for the rashes 1x/day.  On 4/14/2021, the rashes have improved and I had less than 10 rashes on my legs.  Since I still had some rashes, I continued to take 1 Zyrtec 10mg in the morning &amp; applied mometasone ointment to the rashes.   On 4/16/2021, the rashes had resolved.

Felt like my motor skills were shutting down and was getting weakness like I was about to pass out. Although I have a lot of allergies to medication, I have NEVER had a reaction to a vaccine before. I was taken in for observation and this was reported. The day after the shot I woke  up with a excruciating  headache that last all day intermittently for five days with no relief from ibuprofen.  Right leg throbbing pain and hot on second day. Third day had very severe pain in the abdomen like a lot of gas early in the morning while sleeping.

She also stated her tongue felt a little tingly and numb.  She was taken into our immunization room and she started out seating then decided she would feel better laying down. We gave her a half of a Benadryl to help with the nausea. She was given cold compresses, water and some ice to suck on. Her blood pressure was taken and was 122/70 mmHg, heart rate was 58 bpm.  She was laying down for approximately 20 minutes, then stated she was feeling better and moved to a sitting position. She was felt she was improving, and after a few minutes of sitting decided she felt well enough to leave. She did state as she was leaving that she has a similar reaction when she gets blood drawn and that she had been nervous about getting the shot.

                                                On 4/5, I started with upper stomach pain and then two days later I had a fever and a very rapid pulse. I went the walk-in clinic on 4/7 and they performed COVID (negative), an EKG and CT Scan of abdomen (both were normal). The fever went away, the stomach pain eased but I still had SOB, fatigue and rapid pulse. Three days later, the symptoms remained, so I saw a gastro doctor and he said it could be COVID or blood clots, then sent me to hospital on Monday, 4/12 and 4/13. They did 2 more EKGs, COVID tests and bloodwork. I still had SOB and pain in my upper stomach towards my chest. On 4/14, I woke up with a massive headache and saw the news about the vaccine, so I went back to the ER to get checked for blood clots. They did an EKG, CT Scan of the abdomen and head, along with more bloodwork. Everything was normal, but my bloodwork showed an elevation of something that indicated that I have an infection, but they weren&#39;t sure what. They sent me home with no diagnosis. Over the next two days, I rested and I gradually started to get my strength back. I went back to work that Friday for the first time since 4/7.

                                                Ten minutes after I received the vaccine, my left arm and leg felt very heavy, like I was uneven. I started to feel very dizzy and my left eye became very blurry. I started feeling nauseous, as well. On the car ride home I noticed a rash. We thought it was an allergic reaction. After I got out of the car I noticed it went away. It came back later again, around my neck that evening, but it only lasted 5 minutes. It was a rash with white bumps and then it went away. At night I experienced chills. When I woke up I had a blistering headache with neck pain that lasted a couple days. The nausea and balance picked up and got worse. I spent two weeks being unable to see, walk, read or drive safely. I have had to take time off of work. I cannot view a computer screen without feeling nauseous. Most of the first week I spent on the floor because of the nausea and spinning issues. I sought medical treatment. I had a CAT scan and they ruled out a blood clot. I still have low grade nausea. I have regained peripheral vision in my left eye, which was missing for three weeks. I have been off work for more than 2 weeks. I still cannot work at my normal capacity. I still have a very strong chemical taste in my mouth. It is getting less and less, but I can still taste it. I&#39;ve have a lot of swelling at the base of my skull, that has not resolved.

Just watched them and kept an eye on them and used  Benadryl and anti-itch cream, postponed allergy shots from Friday 4-16 until Monday 4/19.  Hives went away in the next day or two.  2nd event-Lower right back pain achy off and on and eventually wrapping around to the right side.  Went to urgent care on 4/29.  They did a CT with contrast and found a large kidney stone that I would not be able to pass without surgery, referred to neurologist. Saw neurologist on 5/3,  kidney X-ray confirmed an 18 mm kidney stone in my right renal  pelvis. Scheduled lithotripsy with stent placement on 5/10. Had  that done on 5/10. Had follow up kidney X-ray and stent removed on 5/17.  Then on 5/24 another follow up kidney X-ray. Results weren?t easy to see due to gaseous distention but he thought I had passed most of the larger particles. Will see him in 6 months. May see him sooner because I?m still experiencing achy  pain in the same areas off and  on  that same side.

                                                Patient called pharmacy on Thurs 6/3/21 approx. 10:15am to report adverse reaction that she believed to be a result of receiving her COVID vaccine. Patient received Janssen/J&amp;J vaccine (207A21A 06/23/2021; L arm) at our store on Wednesday, 6/2/21. She reported 30 minutes to 1 hour prior to calling us that she started experiencing sharp stomach pain (epigastric region). She denied any history of pancreatitis and has already had her gall bladder removed. I explained that was not one of the common adverse effects from the vaccine, but that it is possible that it could be attributed to the vaccine. I recommended she contact her doctor to see if they want to bring her in and examine her to rule out anything severe that may be going on. If she cannot get in touch with the doctor and the pain becomes severe, I recommended seeking emergency medical help. The only other symptom she had mentioned experiencing was the typical arm soreness at the injection site associated with intramuscular vaccines.

I managed to get bac my balance, ability to read, drive and my left and right side are working together again, vision has improved, pain continues at base of neck. I still have some nausea with the ear issue. The tinnitus has gotten worse but only on left ear, It was buzzing but now it is loud ringing. On 06/14/2021 I started getting a fullness of fluid and pain in left ear. I am also having runny eye in left eye, almost allergy like, the eye thing has cleared but the ear thing has not, lymph nodes still very swollen. I did get a cat scan before to rule out a clot and stroke symptoms so they did rule out stroke symptoms. I am redhead and I have heard that people with red hair are more sensitive to the vaccine and I am also small in stature so possibly the dose might be too high. I am also very sensitive to most meds.

It isn&#39;t itchy and doesn&#39;t hurt at all - it&#39;s between index finger and thumb on both of my  hands and it spreads out between the fleshy part between the hand and the knuckle : Thumb, index finger, middle finger and pinky there&#39;s a red splotch on each of those parts of both hands. It&#39;s exactly the same on both hands. Called Dr on Friday morning. I will watch it to see what it does. No bumps and no discomfort (not dry or itchy). It just stays there (little tiny red spots) - been there for five days.

The headache started on the second day and that kept getting worse. Headache, every time I went to swallow anything, the headache would be excruciating hurting at these times. It was unbearable and I had to go ER. They checked to see if I had a blood clot. I didn&#39;t. They gave me a pain injection, Dilaudid, which made me feel disgusting and didn&#39;t help. No medications to take home. Had a phone visit with my doctor. The headache continued, and it lasted me a full two weeks. It has eased up now.

Wednesday, Thursday and Friday - I had headaches and I had extra fatigue (I already do have fatigue because I have insomnia). My arm soreness was on the other arm not on the one that I had an injection. Friday and up until yesterday, I had nausea. Saturday, I had headache and being tired. Sunday, I had chest pain (woke up with it) like a burning in my chest. My left arm, I felt a tingling down my arm to my legs - it almost felt like a blood clot was there in my arm. I had to put heat on and then ice. I couldn&#39;t extend arm because it hurt. Midnight on Monday, the burning and the chest pain was too much and I was getting worried. The only thing I have is asthma, otherwise I&#39;m healthy. I went to ER - they gave a Cocktail of Lidocaine; Malex and something else to see if it would help with the burning in my chest.  Monday, I took Tylenol. Tuesday, the chest pains were more intense.  03:00 on Wednesday am - I went back to ER. They brought me to a full chest x-ray - front, side and back and a CAT SCAN and gave me another Cocktail and also put something in my IV. This time,  they sent me home with four different medicines. The meds are: Generic of Nexium; Aspirin low dose of 81 mg - bayers children - one a day; Generic version of Bentil Triacetin   - I take this when I want to be still; Generic version of Valium - they gave me four of these - and I have one left that I will take tonight so I can sleep. I am taking Vit D. I haven&#39;t taken Tylenol since getting on these. I try to stay hydrated.  I still have a really really funny feeling inside me. Last night, I was very restless and couldn&#39;t sleep. It makes me on borderline and dizzy and my heart starts palpitating. It&#39;s a scary feeling in my chest.

Fever followed and reached 101.2. Intense headache next with nausea, Around 11pm I began wheezing. Just before this I noticed my heart had begun racing. I drank a lot of water during this time, drank soda to settle my stomach and ate 2 crackers. It seemed as though the crackers gave me heartburn. By 6am the following morning fever had come down to a temp (99.2). My headache was just mild and body aches seemed mild. and Some shooting pains remained. On 4/10 around 3pm I felt as though body aches and my headache were worsening. My pulse sped up and my temp began to rise. My temp had risen to 99.8 and my head was becoming much worse so at 5pm I took 3 extra strength Tylenol. This helped a lot.

                                                Received the shot at 4:45 pm.  A little after 11 pm that night, I had mild fever (did not take temp) and severe chills that lasted about 2 hours.  I had a very severe headache and felt very nauseous.   I was not able to sleep well during the night.  The next day, between 7 am and 5 pm, I stayed in bed with the most severe headache I have ever had, severe nausea and extreme fatigue, and sometimes felt hot and/or had mild chills.   I was not able to go to work, as I could not get out of bed.  I was finally able to get up around 5 pm (24 hours after shot) and eat a little something as the nausea had finally subsided.  I was still very fatigued and had a less severe headache.  I was able to sleep well that night, and woke the next day (about 36-37 hours after shot) with only a slight headache, which went away with a few hours.

                                                On the day of my vaccine I had typical symptoms - chills, fatigue, and headache.  The next day I felt better, just tired.  On Tuesday the 23rd I returned to work and felt fine, but I did have an occasion of dizziness and I was tired.  I felt good on the 24th and returned to life/exercise as normal.  I woke up on the 25th in the early morning with a strange sensation in my head.  (I described it to my husband that it felt like I had worms in my head.)  When I got up I experienced dizziness that seemed like vertigo.  I tried to proceed with my day, but I got an intense headache, loss of appetite, and sore upper leg muscles.   I reached out to my doctors office.  I saw a doctor on the 26th.  (My dizziness was better, but I still had a headache and muscle aches.)  We discussed vertigo and possible reactions to the vaccine.  He also found some liquid in my ears and so we questioned allergies.  I got allergy medicine and took it when I got home.   The next day in the early morning the headache and muscle aches returned and I called a hotline through my doctor&#39;s office.  (The headache was quite intense.)  I spoke with a nurse - I was concerned that I may have Covid.  We discussed my reaching out to get a test if my symptoms were not better by Monday.  By Sunday I was feeling a bit better.  My headache had improved but I still had muscle aches in my legs.  I determined I would be able to go back to work on Monday.   The last symptom to remain was aches in my legs.  On Wednesday the aches were in my upper legs , by 3/30 the aches were in my ankles.  I was feeling better by early April.

She was given water, juice, and snacks. She felt dizzy and a bit nauseated at times. She admitted to not having eaten anything prior to the vaccine. At 1500, an hour after she received the vaccine she felt like her heart was racing and she reported that the whole right side of her body felt cold. People with her that knew her well stated that she &#34;was not herself&#34;. She also reported at this time that she felt like her heart was racing. This nurse recommended, by phone (patient had left the clinic site by this time) that the patient&#39;s mother take her in to urgent care or the ED, just to be sure everything was okay. Upon follow up, the patient did not go in but called the ED triage nurse. She was told this was likely a normal response to the vaccine. Patient went home to rest and her mother stayed with her overnight. Today client is back at work- tired and sore but nothing more reported.

                                                I was immediately nauseous and a moderate headache started about 15 mins after the shot.  The next day I had moderate body aches, nausea, and mild light headedness.  I&#39;ve had those ongoing symptoms (minus the body aches) up to the present day.  They&#39;ve never really gone away, and continue to persist.  I did not have any of these symptoms prior to the shot.  I called my doctors office today to report the symptoms, and I&#39;m still waiting to hear back.

                                                Background: With Chrohn&#39;s and with the Erythromycin - I had some fatigue; stomach upset; and joint pain. I didn&#39;t go into it with no symptoms. These that I am reporting would be increased. I could feel injection go into the arm. By the morning of the 15th, I think, increase joint pain and fatigue from my baseline. My knees; feet hands - achy in the joints themselves. Fatigue: wishing I could have a nap throughout the day. These lasted for about a week. I had stomach upset that I believe may have been from the Erythromycin - but that didn&#39;t change that stomach upset - still had it... it may have gotten a little worse (the nausea. By morning of the 23rd, I took 2 mg Ondansetron for that nausea. That helped a lot with the nausea. Around 2 am on the 24th, I woke up from a very bad nightmare and I woke up with a pounding heartrate. My chest was really thumping. I got up to the bathroom. My heart kept pounding harder and faster and didn&#39;t come down. My watch said tit started going up to:  122 to 144  to 154 and it kept gradually going up. I was petting the dog and sitting in the recliner. I phone my Dr&#39;s on-call number and spoke to him on the phone. I called 9-1-1 by his advice. Paramedics came - Heartrate stayed up.  I was still able to walk around the house. I followed up to their truck and they checked me over. By that time as they were taking my vitals my heart rate started to calm down.  (It was elevated about 15 minutes about all together) My blood pressure - 160 over 110 when the paramedics checked me but that was coming down as they had me at the truck and the heart rate went down to 80-90 and was continuing to go down. It hasn&#39;t come back.  They listened to my heart. Never had that happen to me before like that. Didn&#39;t have to go to ER. I do have the apple records of my heart rate, etc. if needed. The joint pain and fatigue faded back to my baseline.

                                                Within 5 minutes of the shot, I started to have difficulty swallowing. I notified the staff at the clinic, They put me in a separate room where I took 50mg Benadryl. I continued having difficulty swallowing along with tingling in tongue and lips. I then decided to give myself an Epipen 0.3mg shot. I had this with me because I had a severe allergic reaction in January to Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. 911 was called. In the ambulance, IV Benadryl and Solu-Medrol was administered. My face was starting to itch on the way to hospital even after IV medication administered.  I was monitored for 2 hours in hospital. I was also given normal saline IV in the hospital. I was discharged with Pepcid 20mg daily for 4 days and Prednisone 50mg daily for 3 days. I consistently had to take Benadryl 50mg for three days to keep itching and swelling at bay.

                                                Monday night had very bad sweats/chills and was tired/sore as expected. Tuesday my lymph node glands in my throat on the side where I got the vaccine swelled nearly three times their size. I felt flu-like symptoms: fever, exhaustion, weakness, body aches and a headache. Wednesday I felt the same and nauseous in the evening. I had iced my lymph nodes and that helped a little with the soreness. (Took IB off/on since Monday as I thought I had a low fever and was achey/headachey). Thursday, I noticed that the soreness/pain in my lymph nodes moved up my jaw and to my ear (on the side where I got the vaccine). I still felt weak and tired. I tried to work at 11:15a and felt my brain couldn&#39;t quite think straight. Today (Fri.), pain in jaw/side of head and headache continue. Think the swollen glands are making it hurt when I swallow. Felt a little something in my leg; but would not say it was painful. NO abdominal pain or trouble breathing.

                                                On March 21, 2021 at around 5:30 I had fever, headache, nausea, fatigue, dizziness. The next day, March 22, I had heart palpitations, dizziness and still fever.  On March 24, 2021 at approximately 8:00 pm, my right leg became heavy and felt numb. On March 25 I woke up to my mouth locked with Bell&#39;s Palsy like drooping on the right side of my face.  My mouth remained unable to open fully for the next day and the numbness and pain in my leg increased.  On March 26 I went to the ER because I was afraid I was having a stroke. They gave me tests and said I did not have a stroke. They gave me steroids and they helped with my jaw but the pain in my leg increased. The pain in leg continued with more pain in my knee. I followed up with my family doctor and they sent me to have an ultrasound of my leg to check for a blood clot on April 9th No blood clot was found. Pain continued and increased so the doctor sent me for an MRI on April 14. MRI showed moderate effusions to the knee joint and I have an appointment with a orthopedic doctor on Tuesday April 20th. I continue to have stabbing pain in my knee and swelling and discomfort.

                                                About 3 hours after receiving the , vaccine on April 5 at 3:15 pm, I had uncontrollable shivers and chills, shaking violently through my whole entire body.  I was freezing cold to the bone.   I felt nauseous and threw up my entire dinner.  That didn&#39;t make the nausea go away - I continued to throw up that evening 5 or 6 more times.  The nausea continued the next day making me throw up 3 more times.  And yet the nausea persisted for a whole entire week.  I had a horrible headache that night that has stuck with me these last ten days.  My muscles ached and shot strange pangs through my body.  I was exhausted.  I could not stay awake.  I was so weak and tired.  I had no energy and just laid in bed for a solid four days. My throat hurt, my neck hurt, my head hurt, my arm where the shot went in hurt so bad.  Very strangely, my stomach was constantly bloated and hurt inside like a bad stomach ache - even if I hadn&#39;t eaten anything it still bloated and hurt.  The painful stomach lasted seven or eight days.  I had diarrhea for those seven /eight days.  I was completely dehydrated.  The diarrhea lasted way too long - it was difficult to return to work.  The second day after the shot I woke up to my left eye red, like some blood vessels had burst.  It took four or five days for my eye to go back to normal.   my heart has a stabbing feeling randomly all the time now and it is hard to breathe.  I wheeze and cough all the time.  It is very uncomfortable.  This heart issue has persisted the entire time since getting the vaccine.

I had a headache, body aches fever and chills. I experienced nausea for a couple of days and a rash on my back. It was a bumpy rash started a week after the shot and is still present. I was very unsteady on my feet and needed help to the bathroom. I missed work that day but went to work the next day. I felt very poorly with no energy for a week. I was super achy and have no balance. I have gotten stabbing pains in my legs especially in my right thigh which dissipate after a while. It has been ten days and I am still very tired with intermittent headaches, but I was able to work out today. My leg pain is less often and less than it used to be.

                                                The adverse reactions of light headedness, throat irritation, heaviness in my chest and difficulty inhaling began about 20 min after my injection, It lasted 5 minutes. About 30 min afterwards the 2nd wave of reaction came on, with the same symptoms but was even harder to inhale and lasted twice as long. I took a combination of benadryl, motrin and pepcid which alleviated the worst of the symptoms after about an hour. To this day, I still cannot take a deep breath in.  About 72 hours after the vaccine I began to have diarrhea (and still have it 20 days later), lethargy, nausea and shortness of breath. The next day I had a little more energy, but still had continued shortness of breath. My vision had become less clear and my thought process a bit fuzzy. This is still happening today. Seven days after the vaccine,  I suddenly became extremely light headed just simply walking. To the extent that I needed to sit or lay down before I began to pass out. After the light headedness came on heavily, I also noticed a very heavy weight on my upper chest and found it quite difficult to inhale. These moments would come and go throughout the day. Regardless of whether I was just sitting and relaxing or walking around. These symptoms would last anywhere from a couple minutes to a couple of hours. I found it very hard to catch my breath and could feel my heart flushing often. Additionally I would wake in the middle of the night feeling that I needed to gasp for air. I sought medical assistance from a clinic, an ER and even my allergist and I am scheduled to see my family physician later this week.   I am not an anxious person, but have experienced many episodes in the last 20 days that have truly made me feel that I was going to die (no exaggeration!) due to the inability to breathe or that I may have been having a heart attack. I began to have chest pain that would travel from the center of my chest to my left shoulder. The pain also would move to my right lung area. During this I also had heaviness in my chest and felt I could not breathe in or out easily. I am still very light headed and have difficulty walking very far without taking a break because I feel I cannot catch my breath. I still have all of the same symptoms that I experienced 20 minutes after my vaccine. These symptoms have varied in intensity. I have often commented to my family that I feel the symptoms of the chest heaviness and heart flushing seem to come in waves. I am a health conscious person and have never had poor health in my life. The events in the last few weeks have definitely taught me how terrible life must be for those who chronically suffer from heart or lung issues. I am still currently battling these symptoms, however, the last few days seem the symptoms have often been less severe.

I had a rash on my right shoulder four days after the shot. It was a red patch that was itchy and lasted for two days.   Two weeks after the shot I had leg fatigue and weakness. I normally get tension headaches but the pain in my left leg was from my knee to my groin. It started as a sharp pain and then it became a dull ache that was there all day. The leg pain was spreading, and my headache had been there for four days. I was advised to go the ER because of family history and the current news about the vaccine.  I was discharged after eight hours and all tests were negative. I was told that the headache had progressed to a Migraine and prescribed Toradol.

                                                Shortly after getting the shot she reported feeling &#34;off&#34; as she was driving she started feeling short of breath and her heart was racing. When she got home around 5 PM she was still feeling short of breath and reported that her heart was racing. She was unable to speak clearly, but was stating that it was due to be being short of breath.  She also reported feeling lethargic and fell asleep until the next morning. She slept until approximately 12 pm the next day. When she woke up she reported feeling right sided cheek tingling. At that time she thought she had just slept wrong. When she attempted to walk down stairs she was limping and reported just feeling very weak on her left side. On Wednesday she slept in late again complaining of lethargy. When she awoke that Wednesday (3/10) her speech was markedly slurred. She was also saying things that didn&#39;t make sense. She was dragging her left leg when she tried to walk. We immediately took her to the ER and she was worked up for stroke. When she was triaged in the ER we mentioned that she had just had her COVID vaccine and voiced concerned that maybe she had a reaction to her COVID vaccine. She was admitted to hospital on 3/10 for a possible stroke.  Her MRI was done later on 3/11, Her MRI showed that she has strokes on both sides of her brain in the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. The doctor referred to her stroke as being caused by a &#34;showering of clots&#34;. The doctor said this usually only happens to someone with cardiac issues. My mom has no cardiac history. Her doctor ordered an 2D Echo of her heart and no abnormalities were found (3/12).   She is still disabled from her stroke. She was hospitalized from 3/10 - 3/16. She was the discharged to other care facility from 3/16-3/26. She is currently needing outpatient rehab in a day neuro program. She attends this at outpatient facility. She has to walk with a cane due to persistent left leg weakness. Her speech has a slight slur, and she suffers from short term memory loss. She intermittently has trouble with her equilibrium and reports feeling dizzy. She sometimes has a hard time swallowing or says that it doesn&#39;t feel right when  she swallows. She also trouble with word retrieval. She has left-sided neglect which correlates  left eye visual deficits. She currently requires care from a general physician, neurologist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, neuro ophthalmologist and neuo psychologist. She was started on a new medication regime 325 mg aspirin daily, plavix for 21 days (now completed), metformin, amlodipine, coreg and losartan. She is going to need outpatient rehab until at least June from the last update we received from her rehab doctor.

                                                The adverse reactions of light headedness, throat irritation, heaviness in my chest and difficulty inhaling began about 20 min after my injection, It lasted 5 minutes. About 30 min afterwards the 2nd wave of reaction came on, with the same symptoms but was even harder to inhale and lasted twice as long. I took a combination of benadryl, motrin and pepcid which alleviated the worst of the symptoms after about an hour. To this day, I still cannot take a deep breath in.  About 72 hours after the vaccine I began to have diarrhea (and still have it 20 days later), lethargy, nausea and shortness of breath. The next day I had a little more energy, but still had continued shortness of breath. My vision had become less clear and my thought process a bit fuzzy. This is still happening today. Seven days after the vaccine,  I suddenly became extremely light headed just simply walking. To the extent that I needed to sit or lay down before I began to pass out. After the light headedness came on heavily, I also noticed a very heavy weight on my upper chest and found it quite difficult to inhale. These moments would come and go throughout the day. Regardless of whether I was just sitting and relaxing or walking around. These symptoms would last anywhere from a couple minutes to a couple of hours. I found it very hard to catch my breath and could feel my heart flushing often. Additionally I would wake in the middle of the night feeling that I needed to gasp for air. I sought medical assistance from a clinic, an ER and even my allergist and I am scheduled to see my family physician later this week.   I am not an anxious person, but have experienced many episodes in the last 20 days that have truly made me feel that I was going to die (no exaggeration!) due to the inability to breathe or that I may have been having a heart attack. I began to have chest pain that would travel from the center of my chest to my left shoulder. The pain also would move to my right lung area. During this I also had heaviness in my chest and felt I could not breathe in or out easily. I am still very light headed and have difficulty walking very far without taking a break because I feel I cannot catch my breath. I still have all of the same symptoms that I experienced 20 minutes after my vaccine. These symptoms have varied in intensity. I have often commented to my family that I feel the symptoms of the chest heaviness and heart flushing seem to come in waves. I am a health conscious person and have never had poor health in my life. The events in the last few weeks have definitely taught me how terrible life must be for those who chronically suffer from heart or lung issues. I am still currently battling these symptoms, however, the last few days seem the symptoms have often been less severe.

As bad as when I had COVID-19 (Positive PCR test early Dec 2020). Symptoms from vaccine went away completely after 48 hours.  **Still have long term effects from COVID-19 such as low oxygen saturation, (averages low 90?s),  shortness of breath, mental confusion, extreme fatigue, headaches, body aches, inner leg pain at top of leg, &amp;  NO smell/taste. Consider myself relatively healthy before COVID-19.  Push myself to try to do as did before COVID-19. Always social distance &amp; wear mask. Would NOT hesitate to get vaccine again! Benefits outweigh the side effects.  Expected short term symptoms since had  COVID-19.

I woke up at 3am Friday morning with body aches and still had the headache. I took more Tylenol. By 9am Friday morning I had severe adverse reactions. I still had a severe headache and body aches with muscle soreness and extreme fatigue. I also experienced chills, light sensitivity and brain fog. Around 4:30 pm I developed chest pains that lasted about one hour. My headache, body aches and fatigue have not subsided as of today. I have had a televisit with my physicians office on may 10 where bloodwork. Some of my headaches rk was requested. The results showed elevated kidney function due to the amount of Advil I had taken to control the headache and muscle soreness. The recommended Tylenol did not alleviate my headache or muscle soreness so I have not taken either medicine.  Some of my headaches have been accompanied with nausea and light sensitivity. I went for a physical exam on 5/18/21 and more bloodwork was requested. It has been 6 weeks and these adverse effects have not subsided.

Called my OBGYN, they said let it run it&#39;s coarse and they had they had many similar phone calls. I take a Nuva ring for birth control, I was concerned about estrogen and the blood clots.  I did not feel well at all for about a week after my vaccine, everyday around 4pm I would get really bad headaches for about 3-4 weeks. I was nauseated and sweating.

On 5/24/21, she did not report feeling sick or having a headache and threw up around 11 am.  Throwing up was the only way I knew to ask her how she was feeling.  She said, I think I threw up because my head hurt.  I asked her where it hurt and she said, in the back.  I took her to the ED and she had a brain bleed and 5 blood clots in the major veins and sinuses of the left hemisphere of her brain.  Her medical team said this is a very rare part of the brain to have blood clots.  I would like further investigation into whether this was related to the vaccine.

She was unresponsive and was laid on the ground. in the process of turning her on her side she became conscious again but did not know where she was or why she was on the floor. She was sweating  and was still quite pale. She said she felt sick while she was laying on the floor at which point she sat up and we moved her to a chair. Upon sitting in the chair she was still feeling sick and was pale and sweating. she began to throw up a few times and I took her blood pressure after. 116/70 Pulse was 60. She did not want an ambulance. After about 10 minutes of sitting her color was back to normal she was no longer sweating and was alert and conversing normally. Pt was advised to head to urgent care or contact her doctor if she experienced any further symptoms as she may have experienced a seizure. She has no prior history of seizure and has only ever passed out from previous shots.

She did have a fear of injections but said she was extremely happy because she hardly felt any pain from the injection. Shortly after sitting down for observation she began to feel extremely dizzy.  observed her condition and immediately attended to her. Fanning her to give her air and allowing her to lay her head back. informed of the need for someone to assist. After 15 minutes of the woman still not feeling better we decided to call for paramedics.  Paramedics arrived in 10 minute took vitals. Glucose 132. O2 sat 100%. BP 120/80.  Vitals were all good but patient still extremely nauseous and dizzy. Emt&#39;s administered oxygen and ice pack to neck. Woman began to become more alert and was responding better to questions. Due to her positive vitals the emts felt comfortable about leaving her after 15 minutes of oxygen treatment. Her husband and son walked her out.

                                                Minor headache, moderate nausea, dizziness occurred the evening of the injection.  Those symptoms continue the following day, along with vomiting and fatigue.  Vomiting occurred late in the evening after bending over to clean up cat vomit, which always sets off my gag reflex, but I was feeling like I could vomit before that anyway.  Also, I had just started taking Hydrochorothyozide the day of the injection and some of the things I experienced can be side effects of the medicine as well.

                                                About 5 or 6 hours after the shot , I developed body aches and chills and had a fever of 101. This lasted through the night, along with a sharp pain in my chest that developed in the night and radiated from front to back, which made it difficult to sleep. During the night, I took some rolaids and moved the couch to sleep more upright, because I think the pain may have been heartburn or some other GI thing (I rarely get this feeling, but I have had it before, and my last meal of the day was several hours before i went to bed and before my symptoms started). By morning the next day (Sunday), my whole left arm was achy, down to my hand and fingers, and my right arm also but not as severe. My left armpit felt tender (and still does today, but not as bad).  By mid-day, I started to feel better, the fever was gone, and by late afternoon, the body aches were gone. My left arm and hand was still tender, but not as bad. By Sunday night i would say I was back to about 80%, and by Monday morning, 95%, and by late Monday morning, back to normal, other than the slight tenderness I still feel (today being Tuesday) in my left armpit.

                                                Within minutes of getting the shot, my throat became itchy and the roof of my mouth felt like it was burning.  I started breaking out in hives , coughing and trying to clear my throat.  I was taken to the medical area and given a dose of liquid Benadryl.  Within 20 minutes it was easier to breathe and my blood pressure and pulse ox returned to normal.  About 3 hours later I started to get itchy again around my throat and ears.  Per the guidance of the nurse at the vaccine site, I took 2 - 25mg Benadryl tablets.  By the next morning I felt better.

Feeling very sore all over,  like I had a bad flu.  I was very fatigue,  sleeping 18 hours straight.  Extremely thirty,  diarrhea and vomiting.  By Tuesday night I was fine.  I was still sore all over,  but fever had gone back to normal &amp; I was able to eat some chicken noodle soup.  Wednesday morning I was back to me.  Feeling well now.

                                                At 12 hours through 16 hours after administration of the vaccine I experienced rigorous shivers, feeling freezing cold to the bone for hours and couldn&#39;t get warm (even with piles of blankets), periodic heart pain and some chest pressure, periodic knife like stabbing pain in my right knee, mild nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, severe weakness, sometimes a cough.  At 16 hours I got up to get water and had to hold onto things to keep my balance. After drinking a couple of cups of water, I turned away from the bathroom sink and lost consciousness, fainting and falling onto my bathroom floor. The jolt of the fall woke me up and it took a lot of strength to get up. The symptoms were vicious. When I fainted, the brunt of my weight must of been on my upper left rib cage. My ribs were so sore for a week. It was difficult to walk, breath, blow my nose, or cough.  My health provider recommended a Tylenol regime for pain control so that I could take deep breaths and prevent pneumonia. I had a low grade fever of 99 degrees F for one to two days following the vaccine. During the week that followed I felt periodically very ill, had a constant headache for a day or two, and had extremely foggy thinking and sometimes confusion.  I was very fatigued all week long. I lost my appetite and have still not gained my typical appetite back. Day 8 to 9 is when I was finally feeling closer to normal. Today I feel I may be back to 100%, but my rib cage is still healing, either from a contusion, fracture, or break (likely a contusion).

                                                An immediate burning sensation at the vaccination site as the vaccine was being injected. The burning sensation spread from the injection site upward to my  neck all the way to my right ear. The burning sensation then started from my injection site down to my elbow. The burning sensation stopped after a few minutes, then I felt silently nauseous and lightheaded.   After waiting 15 minutes I felt fine enough to go home. However, the pain and stiffness in my neck was ongoing throughout the following day and night and was only slightly relieved with 500mg doses of Tylenol every 4-5 hours.  On a couple of occasions the day of and the day following the vaccination I did feel fleeting chest pain, but not enough pain or intensity to warrant a trip to the doctor. This morning (4-11/21) the aching sensation in my neck and arm (primarily neck) have lessened, but still present.

                                                Approximately 5 hours post vaccine severe chills occurred for the next four hours. Intense shaking to try to warm up body, I used three comforters in room set to 70F in order to achieve any warmth. Just prior to the immediate onset of chills I felt tired as if at the end of a busy day. After severe chills I had extreme body aches mostly in lower half ( butt and legs and lower back). About midnight through the next 24 hours I had severe fever (~ 102 when measured), 2 x 200 mg ibuprofen did not reduce however 2 x 500 mg of tylenol did help but effects wore off before next recommended dose. Spent 24 hours in bed with fever the day after the vaccination. In addition to the severe chills and severe fever and sever body aches, there were times of nausea. Appetite was ok, actually hungry during the fever. 36 hours post injection still no arm pain, lower back starting to feel better, but still have small fever. I typically walk 3-4 times a week 4-5 miles each time, no medications, no high blood pressure, no allergies. Had flu shot in Sept 2020, no effects.

Slight dizziness the following day intermittently but not too bad but dizzy while walking the dog midway through the  20 minute walk.  Woke fine the next day and the next. Saturday night it felt like I was coming down with something as I started running a small fever, felt burning hot, nausea( no puking), loss of appetite, dizziness, clouded head, stuffiness.  Thought it was allergies to the cat but I have never had such a reaction, ever, and I have been near this cat numerous times before.  Woke up in the morning feeling fine like nothing was wrong, except slight loss of appetite but was eating.  Have been fine since.

                                                The night of the vaccination (3/8), my body felt very hot (not fever) like it was going to catch on fire.  I took Tylenol to be safe and went to bed taking it as a sign that the vaccine was working.  I thought I was mostly over the next day, but four days later on 3/12, I started bleeding only two weeks after my last period, and the it was quite different than usual - very fresh blood and lots of it.  This continued for 15 days at time with very heavy flow - I bleed non-stop, and I worried that I was going to bleed to death.  The worst adverse effect happened 10 days after the vaccination on 3/18.  Out of blue without anything unusual, I started feeling very dizzy, nausea, and vomiting.  After much vomiting, nausea stopped, but the dizziness just got so bad, I couldn&#39;t move or even keep my eyes open (things were spinning even with my eyes closed).  I couldn&#39;t even stand up by myself.  This most horrible severe vertigo lasted two and got gradually better.  It took about 5 days before I felt safe enough to be alone by myself.  During this time, I had a excruciating headache on my left side.  It was so bad, I quickly took some painkillers which knock me out for a day.  The important thing is that I don&#39;t ever get headaches; this is the first one I had aside from one I had when going through IVF more than a decade ago.

                                                I received my shot at 10 a.m. on a Thursday morning. Around 6 p.m. on the evening of the shot, I began experiencing severe chills, and I threw up once. The chills lasted approximately four hours. In addition, I had an extreme headache. Once the chills subsided, I began sweating profusely through my clothes. I still had the headache. Around 2 a.m. in the morning, I was unable to stand or speak for about an hour.  Once I was finally able to move again, my skin - not my body, but my skin - hurt all over. I could not lay on my back due to extreme pain in my skin, particularly the skin on my back, shoulders and buttocks. Anything that touched my skin, no matter how light of a touch, felt like I was being severely bruised. My skin was in pain for about four hours. The sweating continued through the following Sunday morning.  I soaked through multiple sets of clothing and woke up every morning completely drenched. When I weighed myself Sunday morning, concerned about dehydration, the scale reflected a 4.2 pound weight loss over the course of less than three full days.  The headache lasted through Tuesday, April 14th, a total of five days with a strong headache. I am still experiencing some sweating but not like the initial round of sweating. Because my shot was given on a Thursday, I only missed one full day of work. However, had the shot been given at the beginning of the week, I am confident that I would have missed at least three full days, it was so debilitating.

It came together &amp; was quick like feeling inside of my nose swell &amp; slight headache. I WAS VACCINATED WITH MY DAUGHTER 18 YRS OLD WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES AND SON 20 WITH PRIOR HISTORY OF DENGUE IN PHILIPPINES. At night as it was getting dark,severe symptoms hit us at home all around the same time. Severe excruciating pain in the back of our head and it ran down into our necks &amp; jaw. I have had migraines &amp; it was worse pain in the back of the head. My son said it felt like dengue when he spent a week in the hospital,which comes with low platelets count. To me it felt like when I had infection in my left mound after double mastectomy and spent five days in hospital hooked to Ivs with 2 antibiotics &amp; they thought I had staff &amp; going septic. I had horrible headache with that. My daughter reacted the worse,she was crying with head pain &amp; shivering non-stop &amp; her body aches hit all over first. She slept with a hot pad on her head &amp; had ringing in the ears &amp; if she tried to get up she heard rushing water sound in ears &amp; felt like going to pass out. My body aches hit as I was trying to get strength to drive to ER if needs be,but if felt like crippling arthritis in arms wrists jaw legs knees &amp; ankles. I slept with hit pad on my head &amp; would move it to joints. Really none of us slept. Son had body aches all night too. Bad headache in back of head for all of us. Took 2 arthritis tylenil. All had stomach aches. Yesterday I was spinning &amp; severely dizzy. We are fatigued &amp; barely moving.

I had vague abdominal pain which intensified in the last week. I am four weeks out from vaccination and I get acute gastric pain after I eat with diarrhea. The pain is from my midline to upper right quadrant pain that radiates out. It is a constant pain at a 3-4 intensity level which intensifies to a 9-10 for a few hours after I eat. I have been trying to treat with heat. I try not to eat too often but it is difficult. I have had to visit the ER and the doctor because of the acute GI pain. There was imaging and IV fluids and labs in the ER yesterday. The CT scan did not indicate anything but I have scheduled an endoscopy to check up higher in my GI tract.

By 11:00 PM pt. felt faint and nauseated and left leg was swollen and discolored. Rescue squad was called and took pt. to Hosp where she was told it was sciaticia.

Per pt&#39;s daughter, she was never called and daughter called hospital to have U/S scheduled. Pt. went back to hospital on 4/14 at 3:15 PM for U/S and she was diagnosed with multi DVT&#39;s in left leg which at that time had swelling all the way down to her foot. Pt. was put on Coumadin.

SHE TOOK TYLENOL FOR HER SYMPTOMS. OVER THE NEXT 2 DAYS THESE SYMPTOMS IMPROVED BUT SHE DEVELOPED A RASH WITH BUMPS ON HER TONGUE, DIZZINESS, AND SLOW COGNITION WHICH LASTED ABOUT 2 DAYS. SHE WAS FINE FOR 24-48 HOURS WHEN ALL THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED SYMPTOMS RETURNED BUT EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED AND SHE HAD EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA WITH INCREASED PAIN AT THE INJECTION SITE.  AT SOME POINT DURING ALL THIS SHE VISITED HER MAIN PHARMACY AND AS SHE WAS TELLING THE PHARMACIST ABOUT HER SYMPTOMS SHE FAINTED AND WOKE TO EMS AND WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL.  THE ER DID NOT FIND ANY REASON FOR HER FAINTING. SHE WAS HYDRATED AND THINKS IT WAS ANXIETY BROUGHT ON BY HER EXPERIENCE.  SHE CALLED ME TODAY 4/15/21 TO TELL ME ABOUT HER SYMPTOMS AND EXPERIENCE. SHE STATED THAT SHE HAD A NEW SYMPTOM OF A SHARP PAIN IN HER BACK SO I STRONGLY SUGGESTED SHE GO BACK TO ER TO CONTINUE TESTING IN CASE THE PAIN WAS SOMEHOW RELATED TO THE VACCINE INCIDENT. SHE SAID SHE WOULD GO TO URGENT CARE IF SHE FELT THE PAIN WAS BAD ENOUGH.

                                                Wednesday afternoon, real tired, headache, body aches and chills. Thursday, I was okay. I felt fine and went to work but in the afternoon, I started not feeling too well and my arm was hurting where the injection was and it was very swollen. Friday, 9th,- I went to Urgent Care - the physician assistant said the injection was given too low in the arm. It wasn&#39;t in the muscle. It created a rash and cellulitis. I had a big bump on my arm. She told me to wait and see. Friday afternoon I experienced diarrhea and  had that through Monday. Treated it with Imodium on Friday night - (two doses) and one dose on Saturday. On Sunday, I didn&#39;t take any. On Monday, I did take one dose of Imodium. From Friday through Sunday I was real sick and couldn&#39;t go anywhere and stayed in bed. I couldn&#39;t even do a telephone video Dr. visit because I was sick. I went to a different Urgent Care on Monday. He said the injection was a fail. It should have been up in my arm muscle and it was too low in the arm. He said it looked like it might be infected. He prescribed something but said I could wait a day or two first to see if it went away.  I waited for two days first before starting the prescription and I started using the prescription on Wednesday the 14th. My arm is starting to feel a little better today but it&#39;s itchy around the bump. He also  said that my diarrhea might have been from a flu virus - he didn&#39;t know if it was from the vaccine. The diarrhea went away on Monday, the 12th, if the afternoon.  (Note - They ran out of the vaccine and a new dose of the vaccine was needed to be obtained from Walgreens while I was waiting in line. - when the new batch came they said that this new dose was the same lot number. But Just wanted to note this in case the lot number was different with this batch.)

I went to the ER because I have pre-syncopal episodes and also started to experience abdominal pain with diarrhea. At the ER, lab work was performed,  as well as a CT scan of the chest and an ultrasound of the abdomen. I feel fatigued and dizzy throughout the days.

Denies any significant cough or breathing difficulty. Denies urinary symptoms, dysuria, hematuria.

                                                Within 5 minutes from receiving my J&amp;J vaccine, I went to sit down and I started feeling very hot in my body. My heart started to race, had chest discomfort and had trouble breathing, my trachea closed up, had blurry vision and pain in my chest. I felt like I could not breathe and when the nurse came over to ask me I could not speak to her, I went into a shock and I was placed on the floor and I could not hear anything nor could open my eyes, from my hips down to my feet I could not feel anything, my legs went completely numb and I had a syncope. What I was told from the nurse that I was given an Epi-pen to help with my reaction. When I came back my body was having convulsions, felt my head spinning, had pain in my chest that so very intense and the nurse got me up and took me to a nearby ambulance and the EMT staff placed like a heart monitor because my heart was racing super fast. I also felt heaviness in my chest and inside the ambulance I was given two injections on my left arm and when I slowly started coming back, I was already at the hospital. I was at the hospital from 2pm to 4:30pm more less being monitored.  At the hospital x-ray of the chest was performed as well as lab work and I was discharged home. When I got home, I still did not feel good, I felt heaviness to my chest, still have trouble breathing and get chills during the night. I also could not stand up and have a nerve sensation to my body and the chest pain to my left side is still very present. I have blurry vision, dizziness, headaches, and my heart-beat continues to race very fast.  I get headaches, have abdominal pain and I peed blood few times then that&#39;s when I was able to pee, my abdominal pain was painful like having a baby. On Friday 04-08-2021, I again went to the hospital because I had fallen to the floor on my kitchen floor and my daughter took me to the hospital. I let the nurse staff know that I still have continued chest pain and pressure, difficulty breathing and headaches, dizziness and they monitored and gave me three pills as medication. I was discharged home about 5pm with a referral to see a neurologist due to my chest pain, blurry vision, dizziness and fever which I had these past three weeks. I do not know why I felt all these symptoms after my J&amp;J vaccine.

                                                Hello, I received the J&amp;J vaccine on 3/12/2021. Eight days later on the 20th when I went to bed I had a lot of pain in my left heel and left thumb.   The next day, on a Sunday, the pain was now in my left heel, left thumb at the big knuckle and top and bottom below my thumb, and just behind the inside of my left ankle, and I had a terrible headache.   I was unable to grasp anything or widen my grip because the pain was so intense in my thumb.  It was so bad I went to my local ER who did xrays and told me it was just osteoarthritis.   The next day,  Monday, the pain was terrible. It was in my left thumb, the middle of my left hand, left ankle, the arch of my left foot top and bottom, the big knuckle at the bottom of my left big toe, my right hand was also now hurting at my middle finger the big knuckle at the bottom. I went to see my family doctor who really was unsure at the time what was going on and said it&#39;s still just must be the osteoarthritis. The next day on Tuesday I still have the headache I was out unable to open my own water bottles or prescription bottles because the pain was so intense in my left hand. It was now extremely painful to walk on my left foot and I had no appetite. The following day on Wednesday the pain was bad and my right hand that I was unable to touch my ring finger or my pinky with my thumb. As hard as I try my thumb just would not reach those two fingers oh. I now couldn&#39;t open any of the doors in my house unless I use the base of my Palms on both hands turn the knob. I now couldn&#39;t even comb my own hair or pull my pants up wipe myself properly. I couldn&#39;t hold a pencil or anything because the pain was so unbearable. I had no appetite and now I have diarrhea. I called my husband at work and had him come home and we went to the emergency room because it was a bigger facility. The doctor there told me he thought it was something more like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. This was by far my worst d ay even though I was unable to work this entire week. Oh and did I mention the only reason I got that back who was because my boss with bullying me and pressuring me every day to get the vaccine. He even went so far as to come of my office and he wanted to use my keyboard to schedule my vaccine himself. The next day on Thursday I was still having a hard time walking I still couldn&#39;t touch my ring finger on my pinky with my right hand still unable to open anything with either one of my hands. My husband had to open all the water bottles and prescription bottles and just set the caps on them before he went to work.  I now had flashing light in my eyes which lasted about a week. The following day I had all the same symptoms but now my left foot was so swollen I couldn&#39;t even get a shoe on it. The big knuckle at the base of my right hand hurts so bad at this point and so does the big knuckle at the base of my left thumb. The swelling and the pain is just unbearable at this point. The following day on Saturday my mom had come up from Florida and stay with me for two weeks take care of me someday the next day on March 28th I start all the same symptoms but now my muscles were quivering on the back of both thighs. By the middle of next week I still had all of the same pain and now I&#39;m realizing that I can&#39;t span open my fingers on my right hand and I&#39;m unable to snap my fingers. Side note as of today I still cannot snap my fingers on my right hand. At this point I have been keeping a diary every day of where my pain was in what the pain level was each day. So strange that it&#39;s affecting joints on both sides but just in my hands the inside of my wrist and my left foot. Are April 28th I finally got into the rheumatologist. He had me go to the hospital and get blood work done and x-rays. On Thursday May 6th I was unable to go to work. It seems like I can go to work about 3 days a week and the pain is so intense that I&#39;m missing about two days a week. Dr called me and said all of my tests came negative for rheumatoid arthritis.He told me not just because I was a patient but if I was his own sister he would suggest going to the Clinic right away. He said they have a larger database and if anybody else was having the same reaction to the covid vaccine they would know about it. My husband came home from work and made the four-hour drive to the Clinic. I was there Thursday and Friday they the blood work a sonogram x-rays the whole gamut of tests. The rheumatologist in the ER said that he thinks it&#39;s still something like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus but that was in the early stages and not showing up positive on the test. On Friday I met with dr. a rheumatologist oh, and the chairman at the Clinic. They said this is a very rare reaction to the J&amp;J vaccine and they&#39;re hopeful by prescribing me a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and Voltaren gel that hopefully I will have some relief within a week and they were hopeful that the symptoms will go away within 3 months. They also took me off work for the next week. Did I mention got the first month that was going on they have me on 50 mg of Prednisone for one week then 100 mg of Prednisone for 2 weeks and then back down to 50 mg for one week. After being on that high dosage of Prednisone for an entire month I still have all of the swelling and pain in my joints. My joints are very stiff at this point. The prednisone maybe eased the pain just a touch but the pain and swelling was definitely there, and the pain is excruciating. I&#39;m feeling so alone, and scared because I don&#39;t know anybody else that&#39;s having the same reaction. I&#39;m also fearful I&#39;m going to lose my job I&#39;m missing so much work. But I also feel like my boss pressured me into this and now I&#39;m suffering. If anybody is having the same reactions to Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine please reach out to me. I have my vaccination card I can show you and I have a ton of doctor and  hospital records to verify my story. I&#39;m really worried because I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on with me, how long it&#39;s going to last, and is it going to come back if I do get these symptoms to go away.  My work place offers no paid extended leave, and has repeatedly asked me I&#39;d I was quitting my job.   I&#39;m only having these problems because I was pressured and bullied into getting this vaccine. I completely blame my boss. I would have never got vaccinated if he wasn&#39;t on me about it every single day repeatedly. I&#39;m at a loss as to what to do from here. I have no income coming in. Do I qualify for unemployment or some sort of disability benefits? If anybody can please give me some suggestions I&#39;m open to whatever you have to say

I went to work that morning, went home at 4pm and slept for 2.5 hours and was fine the next day.  By Friday morning, I woke up with shoulder pain, but noticed it more so when I got in the shower and tried to shave under my right arm with my left hand.  Same problem existed with putting on deodorant and getting dressed.  I knew it might take a couple of weeks for the pain and difficulty with range of motion to subside, but as of today, nothing has subsided.  I contacted the clinic a couple of weeks ago and then got a call last week to see one of their physicians on June 2.  I couldn&#39;t get in to see my doctor until June 15, so I went ahead and accepted the appointment on June 2 with PMS.

She was also placed on pulse dose steroids 1000 mg/day methylprednisolone given her history of ground glass lung opacities in 2018.  Progressed to high-flow nasal cannula, then BiPAP on 5/14, and was intubated on 5/17.   Paralysis and proning initiated.  Transferred to another hospital for possible VV ecmo candidacy. Patient with severe acute respiratory failure d/t covid who has failed treatment with the ventilator despite paralysis and proning.   CTS asked to place patient on VV ECMO.    5/20/21 1135am  initiated ECMO Patient is a 50yr old female with past medical history of hypertension, asthma, OSA and obesity BMI 41.5 who presented to hospital on 5/13 with progressive cough and shortness of breath for about a week.  Of note, patient also has a history of respiratory failure presenting with ground glass opacities on CT scan in 2018 with unclear etiology despite bronchoscopy and serologic studies which resolved with high dose corticosteroids.  Patient recently tested positive for COVID on 5/8 and received johnson and johnson vaccine in April. Patient was admitted on 5/13 and treated with decadron, remdesivir and tocilizumab.  Course complicated by progressive respiratory failure requiring HFNC followed by Bipap and ultimately intubation on 5/17.  Due to elevated d-dimer, lower extremity dopplers were obtained which were negative, however a heparin gtt was initiated. Course further complicated by cold left lower extremity; arterial duplex demonstrated distal popliteal artery thormbus extending into the peroneal, anterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. therefore heparin was switched to argatroban and a HIT panel was sent.  On 5/19 patient continued to decline despite paralytic and pronning.  Patient transferred to ICU for further level of care and VV ECMO evaluation. On arrival patient was started on veletri; however due to continued respiratory decline a shock call was placed for VV ECMO and patient cannulated for VV @ 1200. Cannulation was difficult and patient was felt to have an IVC thrombus as clot was seen going into the ECMO circuit during cannulation. Post cannulation she developed worsening septic shock and DIC. She received 2uprbc, 1unit cryo, 1 platelet, 2 FFP, 5 liters crystalloid and 1L albumin. Blood cultures positive for GPC in clusters. Escalating vasopressors (Epi/NE/vaso) and ongoing hypoxia family opted to change code status to DNR. Patient then continue to have worsening hemodynamic instability and went into PEA and ultimately asystole. She was pronounced deceased at 1815. Family was en route already due to her instability thus will be notified of her passing once they arrive. Dr. was notified of patients death.

The patient took a diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and then she had headache, dizziness, ringing in the right ear, nausea, and her fever jumped to 104. The patient laid down her head into floor because the dizziness was so bad and she ended up in more muscle cramping. The patient&#39;s fever never went away but went down and did not go for about a week and three days; the fever was just hanging out at 100 (unit unspecified) the whole time. The patient&#39;s dizziness and ringing was going on and also had GI (gastrointestinal) problems and really bad headache.

Emergency Department Attending Attestation Note   See resident/PA/student note for further details of HPI, history, exam, ED course, and diagnoses.   Briefly, this is a 51 y.o. female with PMH reviewed in chart and w/ patient notable for insulin dependent diabetes, depression, prothrombin mutation, migraine, p/w concern for allergic reaction.  Emesis or change in Covid vaccine today.  10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, patient reports feeling thick in her tongue with tingling in her lips.  Patient was given Zertec.  The minutes later, her lips began to swell up and was also noted to have new erythematous rash between her eyes and forehead.  Patient was given 50 mg of Benadryl.  Patient felt like she could not swallow with worsening lip swelling.  She was given EpiPen and 911 was called. No stridors.  No wheezing.  Reports continued tingling and the numbness in her mouth but no lip swelling or tongue swelling.  Denies any difficulty swallowing at this time.  No wheezing.  No abdominal pain or nausea.  No rash at this time.   Of note, patient also notes left-sided facial, arm, and leg numbness starting about 10 minutes prior to arrival to the emergency department.  She reports that she has had recurrent numbness on the left side in the past, which was thought to be due to migraine versus TIA.  She has had extensive work-up and multiple hospitalization for this symptom.  She reports that she is allergic to iodine and gadolinium containing contrast.  Denies any headache at this time though she had a mild headache after receiving the vaccine.  Denies any blurry vision.  Denies any weakness in her bilateral upper and lower extremities.  Assessment and Plan:    Vital signs notable for O2 sat of 96 to 98% on room air without tachypnea.  Patient is mildly hypertensive.  Patient is well-appearing speaking full sentences without any dysarthria.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Extraocular movement intact.  She notes diminished sensation to her left face, left upper extremity, and left lower extremity.  Tongue is midline.  Hearing is intact bilaterally.  No facial droop.  She has 5 out of 5 strength in bilateral upper and lower extremities.  No pronator drift.  Normal gait.  No tongue swelling or lip swelling.  No stridors.  No uvula swelling.  No pharyngeal or erythema.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezing or rhonchi.  Cardiac exam without murmurs rubs or gallops.  Regular rhythm.  No abdominal distention or tenderness on palpation.  No CVA tenderness.   51-year-old female who is presenting to the emergency department with improving lip swelling and numbness in her mouth, raising a concern for anaphylaxis related to her Covid vaccine.  Reassuringly, status post EpiPen, her symptoms are improving.  However, she has new onset left-sided numbness, with without any headache.  She reports that she has had this numbness in the past the last time she had the numbness on the left side was approximately 10 years ago.  Her neurologic exam is only notable for diffuse numbness on her left side including her face.  Differential diagnosis include migraine headache and TIA.  Stroke is possible though less likely given the patient has had the same symptoms in the past with negative work-up.  Will defer code stroke at this time but will emergently consult neurology.  Will get labs including BMP and CBC.  We will continue to monitor her from the anaphylaxis perspective.  We will also give her a dose of steroid.  Prednisone 60 mg by mouth given 12:29 PM  NEUROLOGY CONSULT NOTE  Assessment: Formulation- Diagnosis is guarded. Localization structurally would suggest subcortical (thalamic) or small brain-stem in a sensory territory on the right. Etiologies could be stroke given her vascular risk factors but seems unlikely given there is stereotypy of earlier symptomatology. Demyelinating would be another possibility as well, but again, the stereotype. Seizure unlikely because of the timing of rush from toes to body was minutes and duration of some occasions being days. Complicated migraine possible, has some risk factors, but should be treated as dx of exclusion. She does make complaint of headache, which could support. Some FND elaboration on her anxiety-ridden allergic reaction is also possible, but no objective non-structural signs to support.

                                                Ongoing nausea - started two days after vaccine. Similar to &#34;morning sickness&#34; - starts the moment I rise in the morning (4:30 / 5:00am) and continues to approximately 11:00 am each day.  Some days are worse than others.  Enough of a feeling of queasiness to keep a small vial of peppermint oil with me at all times to quell the nausea (oil placed under nose helps).  I need to pace myself , a banana will take me over an hour to finish.  I did NOT have this prior to receiving vaccine and pray this will eventually go away.  It has been 2 weeks since vaccine.

A few hours later, I had a 101 fever, chills, stronger fatigue, strong headache, muscle aches. Around 6pm, I began vomiting continuously. I spoke with an advice nurse and she told me to go to the emergency room. I continued to vomit until about 11:30pm, I was weak and felt like passing out a few times. Later in the evening, I took a Tylenol and finally went to sleep. On April 2nd (day after shot), I woke up with fatigue and headache, but fever was gone and I no longer vomited. I took another Tylenol and headache went away.

                                                I received my vaccine about 3pm Sat. April 3rd. About an hour or so later I started to feel ?run down? but nothing major. At 9pm I began getting chills but did not feel feverish. By 9:15 my body was aggressively trembling. Even my teeth were chattering. I could not control the shaking. I put many layers of blankets on me and turned my heat up to 80 in an effort to get warm. At some point I dozed off. I woke up at 12:30am and had a fever of a little over 101 degrees.  I fell asleep about 3am, still aggressively shaking.  I woke up at 9am (April 4th) and my head was throbbing. My fever was now 102.2. Also, every muscle in my back and shoulders ached. I sat up because I needed to get to the kitchen for some water. Once I stood up, my body felt like it was weighed down by heavy sandbags. I could barely walk to my kitchen and back. I went back to bed and covered up in massive blankets and tried to stay still. I did not take any pain reliever because I was too nervous to.  I never had any nausea but smells bothered me and I had no appetite. My fever stayed at 102.2 until I went to sleep (around 10pm).  Monday (April 5th) I still had chills but much milder. My temp was just over 101 all day. My head felt better but my muscles still hurt. By late evening (10pm) my fever was just over 99 degrees. I was feeling better and I no longer had chills.  Tuesday (April 6th) I woke up fever free. I felt mostly normal again except for my muscle aches.  Today is Friday (April 9th) and I continue to have muscle aches. The worst of it is in my lower back and it?s pretty severe. It feels like I lifted heavy weights with my lower back muscles. I have not been seen by a Doctor yet as I have no insurance. I?m not sure if I need to or not.   I wanted to contact you because I am a healthy person and what I experienced was BRUTAL. I have NO IDEA how a frail or vulnerable person could go through what I went through. Also, people need to know that they may have to take time off of work to deal with these side effects.

                                                Vaccine received at approximately 1:30pm.  Around 6pm, had noticeable chills, progressing to severe chills by 7pm.  Muscle aches and headache also began about that time.  Went to sleep.  Around 1:30 woke up with nausea and sweaty chills.  Walking to the bathroom was difficult due to extreme fatigue.  Fever measured at 103 degrees.  Took Tylenol.  Nausea resolved by 7am 4/10, but had no appetite. Fatigue throughout day (4/10) - slept most of the day.  As of 7am on 4/11, mostly better.  Remaining symptoms are a lingering headache, moderate fatigue, and vaccine site muscle soreness.  Perhaps some brain fog, as this form seems challenging and it shouldn&#39;t. Note:  I had had little sleep the week prior to the vaccine, which may have affected my reaction.

The day following I was tired and had a headache. Now on April 13, I feel better but still tired and my breathing feels heavy but I am giving it some time for improvement.

It felt much like an injection would if you were getting a filling at the dentist.  I couldn&#39;t see any swelling or puffiness but definitely numb.  This passed within the first few hours. - first two days - I was very sore and achy in my muscles all over my body, but on the third day it was centralized to just the muscles on my upper arm and under the arm kinda into the &#34;peck&#34; area I believe it would be called. - day 6 - today I have mild diarrhea and a slight upset stomach.

As the week continued my normal nausea intensified as well as having a headache and began to have episodes of becoming extremely warm with sweat and then was cold. I did not eat this week except very minimal crackers or toast.  Thursday I vomited, Friday I stayed home from work and vomited again. Saturday- Sunday I did not work but slept all day. Monday, I had a work appointment that I went to.  It lasted about 2 hours when I vomited some more. Tuesday-Wednesday while I wanted to go to work, did not feel at all confident in my ability to not vomit as well as hot and cold spells. My abdomen has been distended throughout this with several days of not being comfortable touching this area  I have not seen a physician, however health department said I should report this and I did email   my gastroenterologist at the university  about what I have been experiencing

                                                Received JJ vaccine March 10, 2021.   On March 23rd, when waking, a severe pain in lower right abdominal quadrant and right hip area began to occur. Pain continued thru several days, went to walk in clinic and they referred to ER. Primary care provider too far to drive safely.   Pain ranged from 3 to 5 with intense burning, stabbing or spasm.  Had only taken Tylenol at home before finally going to seek care.  CT scan and labs completed.  Determined to be muscle strain.  Pain medication did not relieve symptoms.   Applied ice and heat treatment with nsaids and flexerill.  75% improved by March 29th.  Saw pcp on April 9th. Scheduled to have ultrasounds this April 16th.  Pain is only level 2 every  other day and lasts maybe 2 hours.

                                                Day after injection, patient believed she was having a heart attack.  She experienced severe chest pain, pain that radiates through her arm to her hands, numb tingly hands, dizziness, nausea, and SOB.  This event lasted about 5 to 10 minutes. The remainder of the week she continued to experience mild discomfort, SOB, dizziness, heart palpitations, and lethargy.  At 2 to 3 days after injection, she did notice some swelling at the injection site.  She did not seek medical attention, but did message her physician.  She was told it was likely from the vaccine and to take some acetaminophen. No physical evaluation was performed on the patient.

About an hour later I became nauseous and my face became very flush red and hot. I went to bed and woke up feeling like I got hit by a truck and was very tired with a sore arm. By the next day I was better. The following week I began with a red hot circle on my arm where the shot was given, it had a ring around it. That lasted for about a week. I then started to get stinging sensations in that part of my arm like I was being stung by a bee. These lasted for about 2 days. I then started getting muscle rolls/spasms in the same spot on that arm. They lasted about 3 days. I then started having pain in that arm like I had just gotten the shot and as I was rubbing it, I noticed a large indent in my arm. I went to the doctor, and they said they had no idea why it happened but if I get more symptoms to come back. The doc appt was on 4/12/21. It has been over a month of these side effects. Doctor not sure if it will be a permanent disfigure.

                                                Bad headache developed on April 8th at 11 AM.  By 2:30,  needed to sleep.  Unconscious for 3 and 1/2 days.   I have no recollection of any of this time.  I?m only listening to what have  told by the medical field and my family.   My husband started calling MEDICAL CENTER Friday morning and A called the helicopter by Friday afternoon at three.   They were ruling out a stroke.  By the time they landed the helicopter they knew it was not a stroke and started doing testing like CAT scans , lumbar punctures.  From what I?ve been told they ran four antibiotics IVs.  I remember waking up Sunday morning and someone was sitting in the chair next to me and all I kept saying was that I was hungry.  The lady started crying and said that I had been unconscious.  She tried to tell me who I was and that I was something called married and that I had children.  She tried to explain what had happened but I wasn?t able to comprehend.  I didn?t know what it meant that I lived on a farm or that I had animals.  Or that we had a vet practice.   I remember medical people asking me who I was and what the date was and if I remember how I got there and all I could do was smile.   It?s like the words just would not come.  And they diagnosed it as an cephalitis over the next couple days.  Where the brain swells up and you have memory loss and I had a high fever.  I had a lot of nausea after they put me on oral anabiotic?s.  I kept hearing from nurse reports that I had almost died.  These were hard things to here.  I?m forever thankful for all the people that have gone before me for doing the drug trials.    I am a energetic lady and I?m slowly getting back to myself.  I feel very thankful for the great care at the medical center.  I appreciate everything that you do every day.   I would not recommend getting vaccinated with this drug.  I am one of the healthiest people that I know. No I can?t believe this is happened to me.  I take good care and eat healthy and have no bad habits. I meditate and pray and have a joy filled life.

                                                Day of Vaccination, fatigue 4 hours after.  12 - 13 hours after I woke up with unusual joint pain very intense in my ankles, feet and knees and a bad headache that was not like my usual headaches.  the next day, I felt pretty good, I told my husband I have a leg cramp tin my left leg that does not feel like a charley horse.  I ate a banana, drank lots of water and took a magnesium capsule to help with the leg cramp. and by 1pm I started to develop a headache.  I did not report because I have frequent headaches.  It intensified as the day progressed.  after Sunday, this became a daily occurrence. Early afternoon I would start to get intense headaches and i would go home take benadryl and sinus medicine to help  ease the pain.  Continued on daily until Saturday April 17th when my headache became so bad I could not stand it anymore.  I was nauseous and shaking.  No fever but profuse sweating and weakness.  Went to the ER around 930pm and was released around 12am after they gave me an IV with anti nausea meds and benadryl.  Sunday I was weak with headache all day.  Woke up today (Monday 4/19) with a headache and felt fatigued and severe headache.  It does not feel like a sinus headache nor tension, nor hormonal.  It is my entire head throbbing and left side of my head is sensitive to pressure.  I have not sustained any head injuries in the past year or longer.

My lower legs, feet, hands, left arm and chest begin to tingle. After sitting a few minutes it did not get worse. The tingling is not constant now, but I am still having it. Seems like I have it in the left arm more often than anywhere else.  Within 20 minutes of the shot I began having gastrointestinal issues., that progressed.  It built into strong chest pressure, acid reflux and indigestion. I got into the Dr on March 25. He prescribed Nexium. I am now having significant hair loss and have started having heart palpitations. I am waiting on his response as to what tests are needed to proceed.

                                                Within 6 hours after the vaccination, I experienced significant chills, then high fever, then body aches, then intense nausea. These symptoms were as expected and seemed to subside within 48 hours. However, the nausea did not subside and for the following 2 weeks, I experienced significant &#39;waves&#39; of nausea brought on by various factors such as car/plane (motion sickness), sun exposure (75 degrees on a beach for 20 minutes), various foods, etc.   Approximately one week after the vaccination, I had several glasses of red wine (4 glasses within an 8 hour time period). I am not a big drinker, so this amount caused me to feel intoxicated but not enough to be completely inebriated. I slept for 6 hours and woke up feeling &#39;drunk&#39;- extremely dizzy and nauseous. I proceeded to vomit non-stop (approximately 7 times) over the following 6 hours and could not get the nausea under control. In fact, I had to have a physician prescribe Zofran to stop the dizziness and nausea or else I was going to need fluids administered. This is extremely unusual for me. It felt like the nausea I had been feeling from the vaccine had somehow been intensified 10-fold because of the wine. The Zofran helped immensely however, the nausea (slight at this point- back down to what it was prior to the alcohol episode) continued to persist for another two weeks and a half weeks. A few days ago, it felt like I &#39;turned the corner&#39;.  I am now three weeks out from the vaccination and the nausea is almost gone (90% gone).

                                                By 6pm I noticed something wasn?t right. I could t get warm, even when sitting in the sunshine. By 9pm the chills had turned to fever. My temperature at 9pm was 101.2F.  I also had a headache and started to feel a bit shaky.  By 10pm I had body aches and was in bed with 3 blankets on me and still could not get warm. My temp was 102.7 at 10pm. I tried to sleep. At midnight I awoke to a fever of 104.8 and could only cry. The worst body aches, headache, racing heart and dizziness, nausea and vomiting (after additional aspirin were taken to relieve the fever). I was very weak in an alarmingly rapid period. I stayed in this condition until approximately 6:30am on 4/26. At 7am my temp was 102.5 and I found it hard to make it back and forth to the bathroom, due to dizziness and weakness. By noon, the temp was back up to 103.1 and I could barely cry, as I suspected I was then  close to dehydration. I focused on hydration and slept as much as possible. The fever slowly came down to its current 100.4 at 11pm on 4/27.  This has been an alarming reaction to a vaccine. I have had serum sickness previously, so maybe that is a factor that should also be considered. I hope this is helpful.

                                                She got her vaccine, she felt the burning sensation all the way down to her fingers and her wrist.  I proceeded to go forward and wait the 15 minutes.  She then started to have pain in the side of her neck on the right side, discomfort and pain in her arm.  Within the hour she started to have headaches (has had COVID in the past).  She went home and it was a nagging pain in her arm, not at the site but the whole arm was sore and limited using the arm due to the discomfort.  That night is when she came on the news and started that the vaccine was being pulled from administration.  That night it was like a pulling sensation right in her upper arm, up near the armpit and the fatty tissue from the breast and where you raise your arm.  When she started noticing the discoloration started in her skin.  Her hands started getting black, under both arms were black, the back of her legs was black, and she started feeling worsening fatigue.  She started getting worried and was looking at how her veins turned purple blue/green just in the one arm.  She was trying to figure out why she had limited use of her arm, and was holding it as if she had a sling on it as when it hung to her side it had the pulling sensation and a crawling sensation in her veins (that night and going into the next day).  The next morning she was so exhausted and tired, as was her mother who had the vaccine at the same time, and was not feeling well.  She was feeling that possibly due to the fibromyalgia she was have worsening symptoms than her mother.  She then started bruises on her body, on the arm itself as if somebody grabbed and squeezed her arm, purplish/black bruising.  It had her forearm develop 3 large pockets of swollen, almost as if the medicine was sitting in her arm.   She was slowly getting the pulling sensation down to her hand, and she called the UC first and due to the high volume of COVID she wanted to know how long of a wait she would have.  They instructed her to go to the ER due to the development of the blood clots on the news.  There was no change in her symptoms, and got to the point that she could not move her arm, and the knots stayed in there and there was a reddish discoloration around them.  Now she was having a pulling sensation in her chest and palpitations of pain near her heart.  She was having soreness in her legs to the point that she was not able to walk, and felt it was in her nerves 3 days after the vaccine.  She stayed in the bed the entire week just due to the exhaustion and effects.   Every time she would go to reach for something she would have the pulling sensation down to her hand, and the entire arm was swollen with the bruising all over.  Her body started having purple and blue knots and also in the left leg.  Her arm and fingers were swollen as well.  She then started having itching of her arm, and her lips started swelling and got up and went to Hospital and was able to be seen.  She was having problems with her stomach as well, having a knot in the stomach where it was protruding and started loosing weight since the vaccine.    The ER doctor told her she had a reaction to the vaccine, and did a Doppler to see if she had blood clots.  They did not give her the results and didn&#39;t feel that she didn&#39;t have problems.  She also went to the UC and back and forth to the ER, and still had the knots and finally looked at the knots and her jaw was swollen, and her arm was still swollen.  The UC told her that she was having a fibromyalgia flare.  She is still having the same symptoms green/blue and have started protruding.   Due to the fatigue she has mainly just stayed in bed and knew that she was to have COVID symptoms, but knows that the crawling sensation and the knots sitting in her arm, and now her arm looks disfigured and the swelling is not going down.  They told her that the test was negative for the blood clots.  She had made an appointment with her neurologist and has an APT on Tuesday 5/25/21.   She continues to loose weight no matter how much she consumes and still continues to have the knots and pain in the arm.

                                                Around the first week of May I was experiencing a stuffy nose. Around the middle of May I felt like it had moved to my throat and something was gagging me. I went to Urgent Care and they tested me for strep. They gave me steroids and a Z-pack. The steroid was injectable. The next morning you feeling okay, but in the evening I went back to Urgent Care because it felt bad again. They gave me 3 more days of prednisone, 20 mg per day. One week later I went to my GP. There was a rash on my neck and my doctor gave me 10 days of Bactrim. On the last day of the medicine, I developed a painful sinus headache. I went back to see my GP 2 days later and they treated me for the sinus pressure/headache. They gave me a prescription for 5 days of another antibiotic. I went back a week later and they stopped giving me antibiotics because it had been 20 days. They told me to get over the counter nose spray and told me to clean my nose with saline. Last week I went to an ENT. They told me to continue with the saline and the nose spray.

I was experiencing headaches all day. The following morning on Sunday I woke up and passed out, I guess my blood pressure dropped and I don?t know why and this is never happened.  Had no appetite since Friday and maybe that?s why but my BP is 120/60 as of 10:08am AFTER I passed out at around 8:30am. I?m now feeling better all of a sudden, can drink coffee and hopefully I?ll get a shower....... oh and my joints are sore, I think whatever could go wrong , did!

The chills broke in the morning at some point, then I just had a severe migraine and body aches. My migraine finally broke at 11pm. The following day 1/2/2021 I was back to normal and felt no more symptoms. The first day after the shot 1/1/2021 however was very bad.

                                                Slight pain and swelling at injection site.  Body ache and slight nausea and exhaustion.  Worth noting that I was so excited about getting the vaccination that I could not sleep the night before.  I blame the exhaustion and later headache on lack of sleep, food, and caffeine.  I went to bed early and took acetaminophen and slept well.  In the morning a shower, coffee and breakfast and more acetaminophen makes me almost as good as new.

                                                4/6/21 (2pm) Arm slightly sore after shot. No symptoms at all for 32 hrs.  4/8/21 (3:12am) woke up to use restroom and I felt as though I was spinning. Dizzily staggered to the restroom and back. Laid down and my body felt like it was slowly spinning. At (7:45am) called my employer to work from home. Checked my blood pressure (8am) and it was elevated at 142/96. Throughout the day everytime I stood up I felt like I was dizzy as though I was walking on a moving boat. With the dizziness I felt nauseated. I had diarrhea several times during the day especially within an hour of eating anything. If I bent down I was dizzy. Looking to the left or right dizzy. My dizziness would subside when I was sitting stationary and looking forward. Blood pressure at (4:20pm) 142/95. At (9:15pm) I started to get a headache so I took one Excederin Migraine and it went away.  Blood pressure at (10:09pm) 144/91.  4/9/21 (6:15am) Dizziness 50% better, no spinning but feel unbalanced. Feel weak and shaky even after eating. No diarrhea so far and current time is now 1:11pm. Blood pressure at (1:11pm) 130/91. My blood pressure before taking Jansen was 118/80 on 3/27/21.

                                                Thursday, 7 hours after the vaccine: nausea, headache, fever, chills through the night.  I felt my heart feel like it was occasionally fluttering (overall felt this about 4 times).  Restlessness through the night.  I took two Tylenol at 10pm, one Tylenol at 4 am and one Tylenol at 6am.  The Tylenol helped but I could tell when it was leaving my system Friday, the following day: fever of 101.6, acute nausea.  Took Tylenol every 4 hours which did help. Saturday, felt much better but had sweating most of the day.  The sweating subsided at night Sunday morning, still sweating.  I also had weird vivid dreams since taking the vaccine.  Could be unrelated but I usually don&#39;t have dreams like that

Those symptoms persisted for around 14 hours, and then the fever began to go down, and i began to feel slightly better.  I was very sick and extremely fatigued sleeping all day for about the next 48 hours.    I had no appetite for several days.  Overall I felt very sick like I had a very bad flu.

                                                Everything was fine at time of shot which was at 11:45. I had no effects, I left clinic  around 12: 30 that afternoon, and went to do a job. I headed home around 4 pm and started to feel warm, but thought it was the sun. Around 5:15 I got the chills, very bad. So bad my jaws were shaking. I tried to use a heating blanket to get warm, but was very miserable. About an hour later I started running a fever that kept going up. My ears started to hurt and the ringing was really bad. By 8:30 my fever had spiked to 102 and I was so nauseous I had a hard time moving around, I almost used the bathroom on myself twice. Started burning up but still unable to move, I went outside to cool down and had a family member take me to the urgent care. They said my arm was swollen from the injection site and that everything was normal and that it was a good thing I was having these experiences because it means the vaccine was working.  Gave me nausea medicine and aspirin and sent me home. I was unable to sleep from all the pain in my body and just laid here in pain starting to get really hot. Woke up around 4 soaking wet where I broke the fever and then continued to have a mild fever all day Sunday, April 11, with mild sweats on and off when my body would get too hot. Today just been trying to move around but very tired and exhausted. Had hard time sitting up to do some work at the table, so been laying down most of the day.

                                                Lady had vaccine, was told it was Janssen but lot # is Moderna.  She got the vaccine, the night of the vaccine around 5:30 she got a raging headache (she does get reactions to most vaccines).  She took Tylenol and her arm did hurt.  The next day she was still really hurting, her headache was really, really bad, and it stayed until Sunday.  Then on Sunday she was ok.  On Monday when she went to work and her right arm went limp, and while she was walking her right leg gave way and almost fell, grabbed hold and steadied herself.  The raging headache/migraine came back and she started getting nauseous, her lower back hurt, her upper neck area hurt like somebody was pounding her neck.  Then she got diarrhea and really really tired on Monday and Tuesday and also had loss of appetite.  Then yesterday 4/13/201 she just had the headache and a sound in her ear, went to UC and got drops for it.  Her temperature was 96.5, and her normal is 98.7, and was told that she was really cold.  Her PB was really high and the doctor took it again but it was not as high, attributed it to anxiety.  Last night the lower abdomen pain started, feeling like she was getting her period which she has not had in over a year.  She saw a little blood on her panty liner, and was thinking she was going to have a period, but the pain is excruciating in her lower abdomen.   She has also taken Tylenol off and on for her symptoms, and feels like she is cramping.     She is having hot/cold flashes as well, and has not had these issues from menopause.

These symptoms lasted without break for approximately 4 days/nights at which it tapered off.  Also, on the morning of Sunday 4/11/21 I  noticed a vein that seemed to &#39;inflate&#39; on my Left upper forehead and pulsed for a few minutes and then subsided with the feeling of a slight headache mostly on the Left side.

Took screenshot selfie of face with phone. 10-13 days after shot- gums felt inflamed near base. On day 13 went to dentist and he said looked like an allergic reaction/irritation, not gingivitis, as not above teeth but near roof of mouth. Speculated could have reaction to shot in combination with toothpaste. (Evening of shot had chills/ache/low grade fever/head pains/nausea/diarrhea next morning. Took over the counter Tylenol).

Since I got the vaccine, I&#39;ve been getting headaches, dizziness, nausea and hot flashes on my face.   On April 8th, I saw my primary. He believes it&#39;s related to my perimenopause changes. I also went to the ER had blood work and an MRI. No explanation of the results just that everything was ok.  My concern are the headaches. It feels  like pressure in my head. I never had these types of headaches prior to taking the vaccine.

                                                About ten days after the vaccine, I started to have headaches, dizziness and nausea. My anxiety level is up and I have had a feeling of crawling in my back. The headaches last all day and they are like a tight band headache. They were coming back daily. Tylenol helps relieve the pain.  The nausea and dizziness lasted about one week. After four weeks I am still getting the headaches, but they are less frequent this week. The feeling of crawling in my back started after three weeks and it is still happening two or three times a day. I have seen a Neurologist.

                                                Sunday April 11 at about 11pm I started feeling extremely drained of energy and was experiencing some mild abdominal pain. I went to bed shortly after. Was woken at approximately 5am with severe abdominal pain, and extreme back pain in my left kidney. Kidney area was worse than abdominal pain but both were severe. I have had kidney stones in the past, the pain of this was way worse. Was unable to take a bowel movement. Suffered thru with pain increasing until unspecified date at around 2 am I drove myself to unspecified hospital. Was admitted to emergency room and given an in mild pain meds and anti nausea meds. Was given a ct scan of kidney, then a second  ct scan with contrast, as well as blood test. After awhile they came back to re draw blood because they said my blood had clotted and they were unable to use it. I was released after 5 hours with no prescriptions or knowing what or why I was in so much pain.  Pain lasted until unspecified date

                                                Had shot on Monday.  Horrible pain in arm at injection site that went up my neck to my head.  Sinuses flared up and ears started beeping.  Became dizzy and nauseous and had difficultly breathing.  Went to pass out due to blood pressure drop.  Had to breath in alcohol wipes and then both arms went into pain as if falling asleep only 100 times worse.  Could not moves my arms - hands were cramping.  Took 1 hour to get back to some normal to drive home. The next day/Tues my sinuses where still a little swollen along with a little bit of arm pain, nausea and fatigue.   Wed - Fri sinuses continued to be swollen then on Fri - Sun had coughing.  Following Mon was weaker and feeling low immune.  Tues ended up at doctor&#39;s office having gone into a sinus infection.  Was also experiencing shallow breathing in neck and chest.  Started Augmentin 875mg 2 x a day Tues - Fri.  Then Fri night went into a severe inflammation in my chest, throat and esophagus with difficulty to catch my breath and couldn&#39;t eat.  Sat reached out to document through EMR and was prescribed a Steroid (6 days) which I started on Sun morning.  Was very weak and took that whole week with full does of steroid to get back to normal breathing.  Finished Antibiotics (12 days worth) 2 days after completing the steroid which was now Sunday.  Then still had some sinus recovery where ear was beeping in and out for 2 more days.  By Wed of the 4th week things were returning to normal.  Total time to recover was exactly 4 weeks.

                                                On the 7th, I woke up with flu-like symptoms. Arm was sore. I was fuzzy headed/loopy and general flu-like symptoms. Lasted one day and it was gone. 2nd event, I felt fine until two weeks or so later. I started having severe abdominal pain - it felt like diverticulitis. I went to my doctor and she ordered a CT scan to be done. I have had diverticulitis in the past. They treated my  newly diagnosed (Dx&#39;d on 3/19/2021)  diverticulitis with antibiotics and diet. That helped with my symptoms.

Then yesterday  morning was a little achy and by afternoon was miserable the next day she got really tired, joints hurting and had to take a nap.  She cancelled one of her appointments  she&#39;s a home health nurse and went to sleep and when she woke up her throat was swollen, hurting, labored swallowing and when she would drink her ears would pop, and her tongue was swollen but could breathe fine, and then it progressed to where she could not swallow at all.  She took two Benadryl&#39;s and went to rest, and she was not able to move and had to have help getting dressed.   Her joints are swollen, her hands are swollen, but her throat is not hurting like she was yesterday.

                                                Later that day I had the worse headache ever. It was the number 2 worst headache I&#39;ve ever experienced. The headache lasted about a week and a half but it wasn&#39;t as intense as it was initially. It gradually got lessened but it was constant and persistent. I had a pain and pressure at my fore head and my eyes hurt as in the muscle of my eye. I also had pain in the injection site with  muscle soreness but that went away quickly. The itchiness was different than other vaccines and lasted for about a day. I also started to get congestion in my sinuses and my ears. I also experienced pain when trying to swallow. That lasted about 3 days. It felt like my glands were swollen. The combination of the headache and the ear pain and sinus pressure made me unable to work. Up until that point I was taking ibuprofen to manage the pain and maybe 1 or 2 doses of Benadryll which is what I usually take when I get allergy symptoms like itchy throat. It did not work, I contacted the doctor who said I had a sinus infection. I went to the doctor on 04/22/2021 and received antibiotics (amoxicillin) which lasted 10 days. Around this time, I developed a cough which is still present. The antibiotics did not help, the doctor then gave me steroids on 5/12/2021. They do not seem to be helping. I also took Aleve sinus medicine as well. The cough worsened and I lost my voice around 05/12/2021. My doctor said it was drainage that was causing my cough.

                                                After I received the vaccine I felt like I was going to have a panic attack while I was waiting in the chair. My anxieties were already high going in to take the vaccine because I was worried. The next day I started feeling very fatigued, but I kept jumping awake because of the anxiety. I took my temperature and it was between 99-100 degrees. I had a little itchy skin rash, but I&#39;m not sure if it was due to my anxiety. I felt that my anxiety was much higher than normal. The following week I developed stomach issues. I requested that my doctor cut down my metformin mg. My stomach issues went away, so I increased my metformin again. I started feeling better after week 3. I cut back down to 500mg again and started taking a probiotic again. I am starting to feel like I&#39;m having flu like symptoms this week.

                                                Suspected TRANSVERSE MYELITIS. Lower spinal cord is swollen and there is radiated pain stemming from lower spine into hips, buttocks and left leg. There was twitching observed on top of left foot and muscle numbness in left leg, mainly in the front of the thigh. At one point I tipped over while trying to hold a simple yoga pose which relied primarily on my left leg, but was not a difficult one. When I reversed to lean on right leg, there was no problem. I saw a chiropractor on 6/21 for an emergency visit. He adjusted my hips and neck and said he could see something was wrong. The problem continued so I received a deep tissue massage days later. Therapist asked if I had been in a car accident. Everything was painful. I continued to use hot packs, epsom salt baths, etc. I even purchase orthopedic seat cushions for my office chair. The pain keeps getting worse, especially when I sit down. I have severe pain like pins and needles persisting in lower back, buttocks and hips. The twitching/numb nerve in the top front of  left leg continues. It also seems to be affecting my internal organs as I am very nauseous and urinary and bowel movements have changed dramatically and are distressed. I also feel foggy and unable to focus. The pain is like pins and needles, constant tightness, aches and throbs, not shooting pains. I have been practicing yoga daily for 7 years but am now unable to do some very basic moves due to excess pain. Other poses not connected to the pain are fine.

By 11 hours post, I was shivering uncontrollably and had migraine-like headache.  By 13 hours post I had to shed blankets for the fever and sweating. Even taking ibuprofen the fever was high.  The next day I kept taking pain medication for severe body aches. This morning, second morning post injection, I let the pain meds wear off.  I discovered I still had body aches, occasional stabbing head pain, and tingling down my left arm and into my 3rd and 4th fingers.  Currently, third evening post injection, I?m still aching but everything is noticeably improved. I don?t need pain meds anymore.

Did not sleep well much Friday night due to these symptoms.  Sudden pain in left side of my head about 40 min after the vaccine after I walked to the car and sat down after the 30 min wait. Pain starts as a slow dull ache, increases rather sharply, then goes away quickly. Have this pain several times or so yesterday and today even after taking ibuprofen.   Also pain in my neck with what feels like stress headaches with ibuprofen relieving it.

Took tylenol every 4-6 hours which helped only slightly.  Still felt all the same symptoms by next day as well as nauseous and light headed.  Symptoms started to improve by noon and pretty much resolved by that evening.  Total time of adverse symptoms about 24-28 hours.

                                                She sat down after getting shot then started to lean forward after saying she was nauseous. Rph caught her as she started to lean forward and she almost fell but I was able to get her to turn sideways and instead lay down on bench rather than fall forward.  So she basically fainted for a minute and then laid for awhile while 911 was called. Ambulance arrived and patient remained conscious.

Three days after the injections, I came down with flu-like symptoms (achy, brain fog, headache, fatique, chills) This lasted for three days. I started to feel better for a day and then came down with upper respiratory symptoms (sore throat, fatique , stuffy nose, slight cough, brain fog, no energy, loss of appetite)  As of today over two weeks from injection, I&#39;m STILL feeling off.  Symptoms are like having a mild cold with no energy.

                                                Very painful injection! I felt this going in immediately. Probably 30 minutes after I also felt a little dizzy but I also have a chronic condition called vestibular migraine. I was fatigued later in the evening. Had full day on day after vax  because I already had things on my calendar but was dragging by the time I got home. Aches all over especially joints, head and injection site was warm to touch and somewhat swollen. Also started running fever one day after. Highest temp 101.9 . I also started having diarrhea, full on three days after. My taste and smell had been off since having covid in august, but I swear they are since taking vax. Today is Tuesday so I&#39;m now five days in and temps normal today. My body aches are also improved but my head is still a bit achy.

Also experienced shortness of breath, worsening of asthma symptoms and lightheadedness. Woke up on the 5th morning with delayed reaction at injection site. No visible rash or bruise at this time, but hard lump at site and entire upper arm feels very bruised and sore to the point that it hurts to lift the arm. Ibuprofen is all I have taken for it. Will see a doctor if not improved in the next two days.

                                                after receiving shot, I waited 30 min, because I had bells palsy in the past  (about 16 years ago) it was an extra pre caution, approximately an hour later I felt slight dizziness which was not a concern for me  and passed quickly.  approx 2 or so hours later i got a bad stomach cramp similar to a bad menstral cramp however I am menopausal so this was unusual.  I believe it happened 2 or 3 times, that afternoon and maybe once the following day but never again.  The next day after my vaccine 04/04 I experienced a very low fever, came and went most bothersome was the chill and tiredness i felt by evening,  by 04/05 every symptom was gone just a bit of sore arm.  I was away on vacation when I heard the news about the pause and was concerned because I had stomach cramps .  These cramps were just after the shot and came and went quickly so maybe not much of an issue.  Upon return from my vacation last night, I blew my nose and there was blood in my right nostril.  it was not a flowing blood and I think it may have just been caused by the dry air in the airplane?  it was approximately 5.5 hr flight.  Maybe not related but thought I would mention it.

                                                Approximately 7-8 hours following injection I became suddenly ill with chills, fatigue, muscle aches and nausea.  For the next 24 hours I pretty much was bedridden.  It has been just a bit over 2 weeks since my vaccination and I am still struggling with fatigue and muscle (or joint) pain.  I have been to the doctor and she ruled out any of the blood clotting issues.  She also did blood work and everything came back normal.  If I do to much at one time I become very achy in my neck, shoulders, lower back.  It is difficult to fully raise my arms with out pain and discomfort.  I also become very fatigued.  I?m unsure if it?s muscle pain, nerve or joint pain.  I?m a very active person so this is not the norm for me.

                                                Patient reports tear in esophagus on 3/24/21 in the evening whenever she felt sick to her stomach. She did not feel well, drank one beer, and ate a packet of tuna. She continued to not feel well and felt the food did not go down correctly, so she reached into her throat and noticed blood. She called her doctor and the doctor recommended monitoring for increased bleeding. Later that night, she reports not feeling well again, made herself throw up, and noticed the vomit was all blood. The patient then called 9-1-1, and presents to the hospital. During the hospital visit she noticed that she saw &#39;blood clots about the size of a quarter&#39; when she went to the bathroom. Patient reports the hospital gave her 4 pints of blood, 4 bags of &#39;yellow stuff&#39; (patient assumes its plasma), protonix, antibiotics, and NS. Patient was in the ICU and reports being in the hospital for about 5 days total, whenever the doctor recommended being put on hospice. The patient did want to be put on hospice and wants to be treated, so she contacted her heart doctor and is waiting on an appointment with him on the 28th of April. Patient reports that doctor told her that she &#39;needs a new heart&#39;, but that she is not a good candidate, and that the Dr. told her this just a day or two ago. Patient reports that she did not know it was a tear in her throat (esophagus) until they &#34;stuck a scope down there&#34;.

The patient had no known allergies.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 1805029, and expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 16-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included Centrum Multi-Gummies for Women.  On an unspecified date in MAR-2021 the patient began to experience slowly progressive shortness of breath; on 01-APR-2021 she had left upper quadrant pain. On 03-APR-2021 the patient presented to the emergency room.  Laboratory data included: Pulmonary Angiogram/CT Chest - abnormal and computerised tomogram abdomen/pelvis at 09:37, showed segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the lower lobes of both lungs. Small volume perisplenic hemorrhage and small volume pneumoperitoneum in the pelvis or findings concerning for spontaneous splenic rupture and moderately enlarged spleen. Additional CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast at 23:05 showed: Small to moderate amount of hemoperitoneum, slightly increased since the earlier study. There is definitely new blood adjacent to the liver. The hemorrhage adjacent to the spleen appears similar to the earlier study. Due to the timing of the scans with relation to the contrast injection, the physician could not confirm a splenic laceration, although it was suspected to be the source of hemorrhage. Small amount of mesenteric blood was slightly increased. Continuous heparin infusion was started for bilateral pulmonary embolism. On 04-APR-2021, an inferior vena cava filter was placed and patient was vaccinated with Acthib (HIB Vaccine), Bexsero (meningococcal vaccine) and Prevnar (pneumococcal vaccine) in anticipation of splenectomy. On 07-APR-2021, a laparoscopic splenectomy was performed. The spleen was evaluated by pathology which reported that organizing blood clot on surface was consistent with rupture. No evidence of malignancy was reported.  The patient was also treated with anticoagulant therapy (dates unspecified). The patient remained inpatient while recovering from surgery.  On 12-APR-2021, the patient was transitioned to rivaroxaban for therapeutic anticoagulation. Patient remained hospitalized as of 12-APR-2021.  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from pulmonary embolism, haemoperitoneum, mesenteric haemorrhage, splenic haemorrhage, splenic rupture, splenic thrombosis, splenomegaly, dyspnoea, abdominal pain upper, and left upper quadrant/abdominal pain. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, Disability Or Permanent Damage).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 53-year-old female patient of unspecified ethnicity was found to  have pulmonary embolism and spontaneous splenic rupture 18 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  No concurrent illness and medical history reported. Emergency room consult for slowly progressive shortness of breath and left upper quadrant pain that starts on an unspecified date after vaccination.   Pulmonary Angiogram/CT Chest showed segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the lower lobes of both lungs; small volume perisplenic hemorrhage and small volume pneumoperitoneum in the pelvis; moderately enlarged spleen with findings concerning for spontaneous splenic rupture.  CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast showed small to moderate amount of hemoperitoneum, slightly increased since the earlier study; definite new blood adjacent to the liver.  Continuous heparin infusion was started; vaccinated with Acthib (HIB Vaccine), Bexsero (meningococcal vaccine) and Prevnar (pneumococcal vaccine).  Laparoscopic splenectomy was done 22 days after vaccination; pathology report is consistent with splenic rupture with no evidence of malignancy.  The patient was shifted to rivaroxaban.  No other details reported. The information available regarding splenic rupture precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  Based on the information that is available, the event pulmonary embolism is assessed as plausible with the causal association to immunization, per WHO causality classification of adverse events following immunization based on a lack of a definitive plausible biological mechanism; considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, the potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.

                                                The day of the vaccination I had soreness at the injection site.  That evening I had some night sweats, and I felt a bit tired the next day.  That was all expected.  Exactly one week later I had nausea, vomiting and diarrhea that lasted about 24 hours. For 24 hours after that I had a decreased appetite, and then after that I was fine.  Not sure if this was related to the vaccine but wanted to report it just in case.

I started to feel achy after I went to bed at 10 p.m. The next morning I felt very nauseous for the whole day and  my arm was very sore. I had no appetite and just felt icky; like I might be coming down with something. I tried some ginger ale on Wednesday since Pepto Bismol wasn&#39;t helping and felt some relief instantly. This nausea and icky feeling continued every day until today, Thursday, May 6th.

She said she thought the needle was still in the arm until she felt the bandaid go on and realized it wasn&#39;t. She said she felt nauseous, and slouched down in her seat. I went to get a trash can just in case she got sick and she immediately got out of the chair and said she needed to lie down on the floor. We placed her on the pharmacy floor and she said she was having a hard time breathing and her head &#34;felt funny and weird&#34;. I retrieved the EpiPen but she said she never had one and didn&#39;t want to get it yet. She was conscious the whole time and appeared to be hyperventilating so we never administered the Epipen. She said her fingers were tingly and requested we call the paramedics so we did. They arrived very timely and took over. They took her BP and it was fine. They asked if she wanted to go to the hospital and she said no. She stated she was starting to feel better, she could breath more easily. She  eventually was able to sit up and the paramedics got her to call her son to come pick her up and the paramedics walked her out of the store to meet him.

Four days after the shot I got vomiting and Diarrhea that lasted two days.  Four days after the shot I was extremely depressed. I do have problems with depression due to grief. This was extreme depression that started on the morning of the fifth day after the shot. I was extremely emotional and weepy and sobbing uncontrollable. It was scary and it lasted for three or four days. I was very lethargic and unmotivated. I consulted my therapist and she advised that it may be related to the vaccine. It was more extreme than I normally experience. but my mood has returned to normal.

On  April 15th - I was having pain in my left chest would I would inhale - I thought it was either lung or muscular but since it I have heart history I went to get it checked. It was muscular - it moved up from my chest to shoulder the next day and then went away after about a week. I was icing it and massaging it and taking muscle relaxers.  I had a routine visit with cardiologist yesterday. My blood pressure has been elevated lately and so they have added another blood pressure medicine for me to start - I just picked it up and will start tomorrow - Losartan  - 25 mg (and I am already on Metoprolol) and I&#39;m taking an antibiotic for a procedure I had done on Friday

I was given new blood pressure medicine when I visited my doctor. The headaches continued intermittently for two weeks and then they came back. Three weeks after the vaccine I had muscle contractions with the headaches from the base of my neck up to my head. I was also getting cramps in my legs. I went to the ER and they said I was extremely dehydrated, so they gave me an IV. I was given a muscle relaxant. The muscle contractions subsided in two days. I developed a big red spot which my doctor identified as a  Hematoma a week later where the IV was inserted. About two days later I developed a big red blotch on my stomach which looked like the spot on my arm.  My doctor said she thought it was a yeast infection on my stomach. I have also been having weird stomach pains in the last couple of days which started as spasms before but now it feels like my stomach is on fire. The headaches cleared up  after four weeks but they are better now.  ER

                                                I had an cold burning sensation on the top of my left fingers around 7:15pm. Around 7:50 I had uncontrollable chills that lasted throughout the night along with a fever of 102.7. On 3/6/2021 I was exhausted and had muscle soreness. I had no appetite and my food tasted funny. I could only work for half my shift. I slept most of the day . On 3/7/2021 I am still very tired and achy.

I used the wall to lean on to get down on the floor. Lasted  about 1 1/2 - 2 minutes with nausea. I never had vertigo.  When I went to bed I had an ache under my left breast. It eventually subsided.

                                                I woke up the day after my vaccine feeling slightly nauseous and with chills, which I expected. However, by 8:00 am I had a headache equal to the worst migraine I&#39;ve ever had. I laid in bed all day trying not to move as any movement caused intense nausea. At times, I felt that my heart was fluttering or irregular.  I vomited 3 times, but despite having eaten dinner the night before, I seemed to have nothing to throw up. I vomited clear liquid, if anything at all, which had a strong metallic taste. The vomiting was very intense, leaving me sweating and exhausted.  I fell asleep around 8:00 pm, and when my husband woke me at 9:15 to check on me, I could tell that the sharpness and intensity of the headache was gone. I still had a headache, but it was a normal headache. Today, the 10th, I woke up feeling mostly normal, just weak.

                                                Fever, muscle aches, extreme back pain, nausea.  Fever lasted one day;  muscle aches &amp; back pain lasted 3 days.  Nausea lasted 3 days, but indigestion lasted 5 days.  On day two I went for a short walk and it felt like there was a brick on my chest...I could breathe ok, but heavy feeling in my back and chest.   I walked on day 3 with no issues.  I also developed 4-5  hives on my stomach on day three which were gone on day 4. I took tylenol for the fever and aches after talking with the nurse at my doctors office. After speaking with a few female friends who had the same vaccine, they experienced similar side effects, however their husbands who received the same shot had no issues.  I am wondering if the shot is affecting women differently.

On 03/12/2021 @ 14:30 pt started experiencing headache, body ache, fever (103.1F), chills, and nausea. Pt took temp, was 99.1F @15:00 and 103.1F @ 17:00. Pt took vitals @17:30, BP-100/66, HR- 134 bpm. Pt took IBU for fever on 03/12/2021 @ 15:00 and Ondansetron (Zofran) for nausea on 03/12/2021 @ 16:30. Pt takes Diovan(Valsartan)/HCTZ 320/25 mg, Amlodipine (Norvasc) 10 mg, and Vitamin D. Pt is diagnosed with Hypertension and Fibromuscular Dysplasia. Pt has allergies to an injectable migraine medication, but could not name the medication. Since the pt took IBU @ 15:00, and the pt&#39;s temp increased from 99.1F to 103.1F, from 15:00 to 17:00; the pt was advised to immediately seek medical attention at an urgent care (pt did not want to go to the ED) and to not be/go alone. Pt was also advised to take Tylenol instead of IBU in the future. SPI was consulted and Dr. was notified.

Worsening fatigue as day progressed, developed runny nose and watery eyes, pain in my arm at injection site then spreading to the rest of my body.  Took Sudafed for the cold like symptoms that evening and then in the morning. Went to sleep woke in the morning with severe fatigue, nausea, headache. At 11:00 noted that a bitter taste in my mouth that lead to loosing my sense of taste for 6 hours.  I started getting a fever, which got up to 102 degrees, took Tylenol for this. At the same time my lips started swelling, then my hands, and approximately around 1900 my buccal lining of my mouth.  Took 50mg of Benadryl which helped with swelling and went sleep.  Woke up 6 to 7 hours later and took 50mg of Benadryl for good effect. Continue to have mild fatigue, headache and nausea this morning.

On Sunday (2 days later), I awoke covered in a raised, itchy rash all over my body.   It lasted until Tuesday.   On Wednesday, I had severe muscle tightening in both calves, originating in the muscle behind my knees.  It was so painful, I couldn?t stand in one spot for longer than 10-15 seconds.   I had to either sit or walk.  I finally have relief from that pain today (Friday).

Around 11:00pm, I began to feel nauseous. I wasn&#39;t able to sleep, my heart was racing. By 3:30 am I had vomited at least 5 times. Throughout the day on Monday, I was still very cold, nauseous (without vomiting) and somewhat lightheaded. It is now Tuesday and my stomach is still upset. I have not contacted my physician at this time. I have been treating myself with ginger ale, Pepto Bismol, saltines and rest. I&#39;m not 100%, but feeling much better.

She also experienced shortness of breath.  She stated she took benadryl every 2 hours for the rash which controlled it and monitored herself with the shortness of breath.  She also stated that since she was asthmatic if the shortness of breath would have gotten worse she would have gone to the ER (luckily this wasn&#39;t necessary).

Help responded and I came out of it, and proceeded to vomit 4-5 times.  Felt weak, dizzy, nauseous.  My mom came to drive me home.  Slept the rest of the morning and had some feeling of tightness in my chest in the late afternoon and evening.  Thursday morning when I woke up, my arm was sore but I felt mostly better (still a bit of tightness in the chest).  Did not seek medical attention at this time - just monitoring symptoms as of Thursday, 4/8/21.

Had very difficult time keeping Tylenol down.  Was able to get up and use bathroom with assistance.  Worsts headache I have ever had.  Tylenol didn?t help much. All I could do was try to sleep and not move for fear of throwing up and worsening headache.   Will not take this vaccine again as this was a terrible experience.

                                                Started with nausea and headache (within a couple of hours of shot). Woke at 12:20 am with high temperature, severe shakes, extreme weakness and inability to walk without assistance due to shaking and weakness. Had extreme body aches and full blown migraine. Was too weak to call for help. Had Advil in nightstand and took several to help. Called doctor in the morning and was advised to rotate Advil and Tylenol. Was too weak to get out of bed all next day (Friday) and half of Saturday. Also experienced tightness in chest to where I had to start taking Albuterol (haven&#39;t taken that in years). Bad side effects and extreme weakness and total loss of energy lasted 3 days.  Persistent headache and tightness in chest lasted up to 7 days.. Horrible experience. I felt like I was poisoned.

Felt fine until Wednesday then broke out in hives and later that day fainted. Still to this day I am breaking out almost every day and I think it is tied to heat. Met with doctor today and she put me on steroid to try to calm down the break outs and then re-evaluate.

                                                Began developing compression in front of head Saturday morning. By mid afternoon began feeling nausea, dizzy, foggy brain, fatigue, compression in upper body, muscle aches, and chills. This continued for several days with an added headache.

                                                As I drove away after getting the vaccine, I had some very sharp pain in my stomach. It came back the next day but not since then. I woke up during the night with chills and a severe headache which lasted 36 hours. Ten to twelve days after the shot I had extreme fatigue and head pain. It was above my right ear almost to my temple and goes toward the top of my head which was  a very sharp pain that lingered. These head pains last hours at a time and feels like the veins in my head are aching. They were daily all day for two weeks but now they are more intermittent. Nothing I took helped with the pain. They are not like headaches. On 04/17/2021 I woke up during the night with a sharp pain in my head. I went to the ER and they did a MRI but they did not find anything. The sharp pains lasted the next two days. My doctor said that the shot had triggered Cranial Neuralgia. I may have to take some medication to calm the nerves down.  I still had the pain in my head today which is four weeks after the vaccine. I am also worried about the extreme fatigue which makes me feel like falling asleep at my desk.  Some days it is worse than others. I had Covid-19 in April of 2020 and had fatigue for six months.

I proceeded to have blood and blood clots come out my urethra very urgently. I had abdominal pain and pressure. I proceeded to need to urinate blood and blood clots for approximately 4 hours urgently. I could not go far from the bathroom without having to return quickly to the toilet. I wet myself several times. The clots stopped coming around 1:30 PM. I proceeded to have to have no control over urination urge and could not leave the bathroom. Around approximately 2:00 PM I could leave the bathroom without fear of wetting myself. I continued to have a small amount of a mix of blood and normal urine passing for another hour or so. I have a picture of the blood and clots that came out of my urethra. I continue to have dull pain and pressure in my abdomen.

Acid started coming up my throat so I tried not to throw up. My ears and sinus&#39; filled with mucous and fluid. I took a H2 Blocker 40mg. The reaction to the vaccine has lasted 5 weeks. It triggered my Mast Cell and I am having a constant response daily. I was experiencing diarrhea and throwing up also. My heart condition has calmed down though.

                                                I started with a headache. It lasted for about five days. I didn&#39;t have body aches but I had joint aches. My ankle, knee, wrist and fingers - all of my joints hurt but they didn&#39;t ache. I had gastro-intestinal issues. They all started about the end of day 2 and beginning of day three after the vaccine. I had stomach discomfort. I eventually had diarrhea on day three or four. On the first day after the vaccine, I felt extreme vaccine and that lasted about 7 days. It was the kind of exhaustion as when you&#39;re first pregnant but times 10. I couldn&#39;t sleep well and I was so, so tired. I got acupuncture for my joint pain. Everything pretty much dissipated by day 8. Except, I do still have some pain in my right ankle - in the Achilles tendon area. That started right away and I have had acupuncture for that a few times. Note: I have MTHFR blood clotting disease - I specifically have A1278C. It can cause blood clotting but the vaccine did not cause this issue in me.

                                                By 11pm, I was lying in bed shaking and shivering from head to toe. I had a low-grade fever. The highest it got was 100.7 and it remained around that temperature for 3 days. I remained in bed the entire time and took Tylenol to treat it. I also experienced nausea and severe diarrhea, but I started to feel better around day 4. I was back to 100% around day 7.    I had an ear infection before I got the vaccine and was experiencing  issues, so I went to Urgent Care in April and they gave me a shot in the backside and put me on steroids. On May 25, I went to see my PCP and he put me on antibiotic steroid ear drops. It was discovered that I now suffer from seasonal allergies and both doctors are thinking that the infections are due to that.   Due to my elderly parents and high-risk soon, I also received the Pfizer vaccine and have no issues to report:  Dose 1 - 4/24/21 - EW0162 Dose 2 - 5/15/21 - EW0170  Please feel free to contact me at anytime with any questions.

I am not sure that what follows is related to the vaccine, but my mother received the vaccine at the same time I did at the same location and she fell ill on June 4 June 3 around 1pm.  I had abdominal pain.  During a bowel movement I broke out into a cold sweat with shaking of limbs.  That bowel movement turned into diarrhea.  Then finished with nothing but dark blood.  I rested for a bit as I was having abdominal pain and still having dark blood as a bowel movement.  2-3 times.  When I got a change, I phoned my Primary Care Physician&#39;s office.  It was after hours and I spoke with a colleague that suggested I go to the ER to get checked out.

                                                I felt fine for the first week and the half. All of the sudden, I felt dizzy. The room started spinning and I felt nauseous. I called my husband and we went to the urgent care near us. I couldn&#39;t even sit in the chair, because I felt like I was falling. I had to be taken away, because I began vomiting everywhere. They took me into a room and I continued to vomit. I kept my eyes closed, because the room was spinning and I was sensitive to light. They first gave me an oral anti-nausea pill. They waited about 45 minutes. The pill didn&#39;t help. I was then given an IV of stronger medications. I stayed for about 4 hours. They were able to stabilize the vomiting, but not the vertigo. I went home and never got out of bed for 2 weeks and never got out of bed except to see doctors. I could not walk on my own. I was referred to a new ENT and I took 10 days of antibiotics. They thought at first I might have an inner ear infection. The 10 days went by and there was no improvement. I was still bedridden. I still had random vertigo attacks that lasted from 1 hour to 4 hours. I was given an anti-nausea pill for vertigo and Valium (which I didn&#39;t really take). I was given a 10-day dose of prednisone, which did not help. After the prednisone did not work. I continued having continued pressure, ringing, fullness, and deafness in the left ear, which started on 4/22, and this is what caused of the vertigo. After I finished the prednisone didn&#39;t help, a second ENT suggested I undergo a direct injection of steroids in the left inner ear on 4/29. The deafness, ringing, and pressure got worse, and the vertigo became more frequent. I was then sent to a cardiologist to make sure I didn&#39;t have a virus. An EKG was done, and I went home with a wearable heart monitor. My heart is fine and has nothing to do with my symptoms. I was then sent to an ear specialist. I also saw a neurologist, because I had vestibular migraine in the inner ear, which contributed to the vertigo attacks. The neurologist put me on Inderal to try to calm the brain stem to calm the loop in my inner ear. I still have constant ringing and fullness in my ear and nearly complete deafness in the left ear, but the vertigo and vomiting are gone. I&#39;m on a low-sodium diet and take diuretics to keep the fluid down. The neurologist did 50 Botox injections on my scalp in late April or early May, and this didn&#39;t help.

                                                About June 1, developed muscles/skin aches all over that felt different than muscle aches from overuse.  This lasted about 2 1/2 weeks.  I also had a sudden relapse of SIBO-constipation and bloating.  This is improving.   About June 20 I developed a rash on my mid-inner thighs (which is a place I had cool-sculpting 5 yrs ago - something I regret due to results).  I&#39;ve never had a bumpy red rash there.  The rash was also on my inner upper arms and wrists.  It was gone after about 8-10 days.  Then I had a bad reaction to a mild sunburn.   My right inner calf from ankle to knee developed densely populated blood spots (purpura?)  This also has never happened before.  Then on July 9 I developed a pain behind my right knee, outer side that has no cause.  I was concerned it was a blood clot and went to urgent care on July 10.  It&#39;s worsening, but labs showed it was not a clot (whew) but likely a continuation of an inflammatory response to the vaccine.  I anticipate it&#39;s not over.  (Anecdotally, I work with Covid Disease Investigators and I&#39;ve spoken with many cases who described COVID-19 moving around their body; some who had symptoms return or worsen  after a period of well-being and others who have had extreme reactions to the mRNA vaccines in which any area of health weakness flared extremely and they were quite sick.

                                                On May 13th, I felt my feet go numb and I could not stand. I sat down to immediately find a heat go through my bod - heat to head. I then felt my heart racing. Took my pulse and it was 134. (I have had no heart issues at all previously - normal resting heart rate in the 60s). Three more times this happened, with heat going from feet to head (numbness in feet).  Each heart rate was progressively lower with each incidence.  Then it stopped. This was in the afternoon and by evening felt ok.   The 14th, the same thing happened but only 3 times and with hr incidents starting at 123.  Then fine again.  The morning of the 15th started again, so I went to urgent care appointment in the afternoon. By this time, my heart rate was up and down..  They ran an EKG and it was fine, just showing rapid heart rate. But I was sent to the ER for further tests.  At  ER another EKG, chest x-ray and blood work.  Only item of significance was an elevated TSH.  At this point, my heart rate was going up and down (I had a finger monitor so I could watch it).  I&#39;ll note at this point, the heart rate was random but I was able to walk. Over the next week or so, hr got worse and positional. When I stood up, it would sky rocket to the 140s.  I became shaky, developed brain fog, nausea, feeling like I was going to fall over and felt only well laying down or sitting.  I visited my primary who initially thought anxiety but as symptoms were getting worse (I could no longer do anything: walk farther than from the living room to the kitchen, do simple tasks while standing or sitting - hr would increase while doing activities even while sitting, and no longer drive).My doctor decided it was more than anxiety when I was continuing to have symptoms that looked like POTS. I have been to the cardiologist - she  did a 24 holter and EKG - no significance, but decided my heart was not the primary cause of the positional heart rate increase.  I am due for an echocardiogram this week - just to make sure but she did not think that was the issue. An MRI this week, recommended by my neurologist. and have done preliminary blood work/urinalysis for possible endocrine issues - all that have come back normal so far (but seeing an endocrinologist next month anyway).  I currently am seeing functional neurologist who has diagnosed me with dysautonomia  (so far of unknown reasons) - he is helping me with the heart rate issue (POTS) and other symptoms that have developed over the weeks like electrical zaps throughout my body - some sort of neruopathy. I was in great health until this shot.  I had not even had a cold since January of 2020.  I may have hypothyroidism but it has been managed with some ups and downs in TSH for the last 20 years with no other issues.   Some of my doctors do not correlate the shot to my problem but some have.  There does not seem to be any other explanation.

                                                Jansen Covid-19 Vaccine EUA Within hours of the vaccine I experienced body aches and sore arm  about 16 hours later I had extreme body aches with chills so bad I could hardly walk from shivering accompanied by a mild headache. Even the inside of my mouth was freezing.  I then experienced nausea and extreme tiredness.  Then about 8 hours later I was drenched in sweat thru the night and woke today with only a sore arm and slight body aches.

By around 8:45 had a temp of 99.2 aching, chills, and very hot feverish, and then began experiencing fast heart rate and feeling like I was going to pass out or vomit, wave of nausea and broke out in a cold sweat, chest tightness.  I had taken two 500 mg acetaminophen tablets from 8:45 to 9:30 p.m.  My heart rate would not slow down so 911 was called and I was taken the ER.  I was given IV fluids and Toradol.  Blood work was done and EKG showing sinus tachycardia.  After receiving the IV fluids and Toradol, felt better and was released.

Went everyday care and test was negative. They could see how raw my throat was and starting of ear infection and cough so they gave me a RX for antibiotic and cough meds.

                                                I had awful nausea, loud ringing in the ears, I fainted.  The medics provided help, gave me oxygen.  I started having convulsions.   After some time I felt like the lower part of my face went numb and it took tremendous effort to move my lips to talk.  At that point, the medical called the ambulance and sent me to ER, where I was under supervision for some time. I was very weak and nauseated. After I was released, I was very weak could not keep the vertical position.  The next day I was very nauseated, with awful tinnitus, lightheadedness, and weakness. Staying vertical for more than 15 minutes brought fainting symptoms.  I was not able to get out of the house to work.  The next day the fainting symptoms disappeared, everything else continued. Too weak to go to work.  I started moving about only on the 4th day after the shot.  During this event, I did not have any fever or muscle ache, no virus0tyle symptoms.

                                                I got the vaccine around 3:45 PM.  I felt completely fine all day until around 10PM that night. I started feeling really cold, then suddenly my whole body started shaking uncontrollably.     I also got a fever (close to 102). I paged my dr to let  her know what was going on.    She told me to take tylenol (and advil a few hours later IF needed).  After taking  2Tylenol, the shaking stopped after a few minutes and the fever went down.   During the night i felt slightly nauseous, but i did not throw up.   I also had some stomach pain.    By the next morning, my temperature was around 99-100 throughout the day, but no more shaking.   I still had some intermittent stomach pain but it wasn&#39;t severe enough to keep me down. I was able to shower, get my kids ready for school and go about my day for the most part.   By later that day, the temperate was normal .  I am getting some headaches now, but it&#39;s been a week since the vaccine and I do periodically get headaches, so i would not say for certain it&#39;s from the vaccine.  I am also still very intermittently getting some stomach pain. I can go for hours with no pain and then some random pains that come and go.

I was really sick for the next few days. I was tired, too. The reflux made me go to the doctor - a couple weeks after vaccine. Increased symptoms of it real bad. They increased my Omeprazole dose from 20-40 mg. I have loose stools. They added a nose spray as well.  I had had my allergy shots the same week as I had my vaccine.

By 11pm when I went to bed, I felt like I had the coronavirus again. I slept with my night gown, heavy bathrobe, my sheets, comforter and another blanket and I was still freezing and achy. When I woke up the next morning, I was sweating so profusely the it was dripping off of me and getting my gown wet like I had been working out and then got in the sauna. All I did was drink hot tea. I had no appetite or energy.

So I have an uncontrollable migraine almost to the point of going to the ER. What?s stopping me going is that I do t know what else they can do that I?m not already doing.   2. Low grade fever and chills: not a big deal  3. Severe fatigue to the point that it feels like my brain is ?shutting down?; I feel like I?m passing out. Eventually fave up midday, went back to bed and been sleeping for 8 hours so far   4. Dizziness  5. Extreme nausea - keep thinking I?m going to throw up

                                                Upon injection, medication burned going into arm and lasted about 2 minutes.  I immediately started feeling odd over my entire body, I felt and looked flush,  felt clammy, muscle tightness,  started shaking, felt very nauseated, blood pressure went up and experienced slight swelling in hands.  This lasted 30-45 minutes.  My blood pressure, oxygen saturation level were being monitored.  I left office at around 12:00 pm feeling better.  I felt off the entire day.  At 6:00pm I started with chills, muscles aches and pains.  At 7:30pm I took a shower and went to bed very fatigued, muscles pain and cramping and chills. I took my daily meds of 125mg of Diamox, and 100 mg of Azathioprine.  At 11:30pm I woke up with a 104 fever, sweating, and a lot of muscle cramping in legs and feet.  My head felt like it was going to explode.  My cerebral fluid pressure was up and felt in head and down spin.  I did not rest well and found it difficult to get comfortable all night.  I took an 200 mg of ibuprofen at 12:00am and started to feel some relief.

These symptoms came on suddenly and lasted until I fell asleep after two hours. Symptoms remained when awoke next day, but were much less intense. Had a period of one hour the next day where right arm and hand went numb. This resolved after one hour. Had BP checked and was equal in both arms and normal. No neurological symptoms. Nausea removed for two more days. Otherwise, all other symptoms resolved after one day.

After it not resolving within 5 minute, I went to the ER. Rate had gone down by arrival but EKG showed depressed ST waves.  By second EKG, two hours later., it looked normal.  I since have had bouts of a racing heart both during day and awaking from sleep.

I visited Dr. and he has ordered tests to check on my heart. I told him I was concerned about the &#34;pause&#34; and the reason for pause because I feel pretty miserable, and he added a CT test that will be done in two to three weeks. I do not know if he will report my symptoms as possibly vaccine related.

I did not check my temperature during the night, but early the next morning my temperature was 100.6°. The headache, fever, chills, and body aches continued all of the day following the vaccine. Food didn?t taste right and my stomach wasn?t up for much food at one time. I tried to stay hydrated.

I had about 2 more very sharp pain in my ear that evening, and feels like I have something trapped inside my ear.  I still feel as though something is still in my ear and my neck is very tight.  I have  had a headache since the injection, and started getting chills and fevers on April 8 and has continued.  I have been extremely tired since April 9....it is interfering with my work.  My stomach hurts and feel miserable.  I have not yet recovered.

I did not have a rash on my arm which is where most people get the rash.  The doctor told me that the rash would fade in a few days and it did.  It is gone now.

But around 6pm,  I was sitting outside on a cool night with a jacket and scarf on and I suddenly very very hot and  had to take off my layers. I felt nauseous. I got up to go inside because I thought I would throw up and then fainted.  I came to a second later (some friends where with me) and felt extremely nauseous. My friends brought me a bucket and I got sick. I felt immediately better. But later that night I had a headache, and chills. I didn&#39;t get sick again, but I left as if I had the flu.  I felt better in the morning.

                                                I received the vaccine 3/12 around 3:00 p.m.  On 3/13 around 4:00 a.m., I woke up with a sharp, localized pain in my right, lateral thigh area.  Within a 15 minute period of time the localized pain moved down my thigh, past my outer knee area, and to my calf.  After approximately 15 minutes the sharpness of the pain subsided.  As far as I know I have had no lasting side effects from this.  I have CRPS/RSD in that leg, specifically in that region, so at the time and with the fever I had, I didn&#39;t think too much of this.  REACTION AFTER VACCINE INJECTION:  As an aside, I had some unusual reactions to the vaccine immediately after the injections.  Within 5 minutes of getting the vaccine, I developed numbness in my lips, tongue, and palate and a &#39;lump&#39; in my throat that made it hard to swallow.  It took approximately 2 hours fpr these reactions to resolve.  I have had these reactions before when I accidentally ingested sugar substitutes.  Also, at approximately 15 minutes post injection, both my ears felt internal pressure (as if I had submerged in deep water) and I could not hear well.  I have never had this reaction before.  This took about 1 hour to resolve leaving me with a moderate headache for 3 days.

At that point, my bad symptoms started. I was up all night.  1. I had nausea and I threw up. I had body aches and no energy to move. 3. About an hour later, my heart started &#34;racing&#34; really bad. I felt like I was running a marathon, and I couldn&#39;t keep up with the pace. I could hardly catch up my breath.  4. Then, my right arm started tingling and feel heavy. I couldn&#39;t feel any of my &#34;fingers&#34; on my right hand.  5. My body kept going from extremely hot to extremely cold. I felt like my blood pressure was up and down. I had more nausea. I could barely move. 6. I threw up again and, eventualy, I slept.

Thought I had food poison(ate fish). running a low grade fever fell asleep an woke up feeling better however a sore stomach (like if stillsick).  Saturday evening the pain started to get worse/running high fever and a tenderness in my stomach. Went to Emergency. After being admitted and doing testing turns out I had appendixsitis.  Surgery was Sunday afternoon and turns out was a preforated appendix.  I am not sure if this is related at all to my getting the vaccine however too coincidental that I received the shot on the 15th and this happened so suddenly within 2 weeks.

                                                4/5/2021--Received Janssen vaccine.  Felt very hot during the day.   4/6/2021--Woke up with very bad headache and rash on the injected arm plus on my stomach.  Went for a walk and felt pain in my left calf and achilles tendon.  Went to work.  4/7/2021--Started my work day as a Personal Trainer/Fitness Instructor at 6am as usual.  Taught cycling classes and trained a few clients.  Went for walk.  Still had a headache.  When I got in my car to head home, my vision was super blurry and I felt very dizzy.  I ate an orange and peanuts and hydrated more.  I was not even sure I could drive home.  I got home told my family how I was feeling.  My husband noticed my eyes were very red and swollen.  I took a shower, drank a smoothie and ate a salad.  Used my aunt&#39;s BP cuff to check my BP and it was 148/99.  I have NEVER had HBP.    4/8/21--Woke up feeling disoriented as if the left side of my face, body were off--neurological stuff.  I went to reach for grapes in the refrigerator and could not grab them.  I felt like I have never felt before and ask my husband to drive me to the ER.  While at the waiting room at the ER, I felt chest tightness and pain and nauseous.  My BP was 153/111.  Again, I have never been diagnosed or been treated for hypertension.  They did EKG, lab tests, chest X-ray.  Once my BP came down, they sent me home.   This is before all the JJ Janssen vaccine &#34;news&#34; came out and the reasons it was paused.  I developed a very bad cough about two hours after I got home from the ER.  4/9/11--Made appointment with a brand new primary care doctor.  Saw her on Monday 4/12/2021 as recommended by ER.  I had never met her before.  She prescribed a very low dose of BP medication, which I did not take because the number one side-effect is dry-cough.  I was already coughing a lot, later on with blood.  4/11/2021--Still feeling pretty bad, I woke up to the news of the Janssen vaccine being paused.  Frankly, I felt relieved that I was not going crazy.  This truly has been one of the hardest things I have ever gone (and still am) going through.  I became concerned about the pain in the left calf and heel could be a clot.   Called primary care doctor.  Had ultrasound of legs and chest x-ray the following day   4/12/2021--Had persistent cough with blood.  Went to ER at 9pm.  Had EKG, blood work, CT without contrast of chest, covid test--negative.  Got home around 2am.  4/19/21--Followed up with primary care doctor who after explaining to her I am extremely fatigued, still blurry vision, dizzy, cough better but not gone, chest discomfort on the left side, she referred me to an ophtamologist and cardiologist.  My insurance and this poorly established referral system is very difficult to navigate.  Up to now I am still waiting for the referral and pre-aurhtorization to the opthtamologist.  (4/23/2021).  I want to say, I am pretty healthy. I have worked in fitness and wellness for over 30 years. I have never drank alcohol, smoked or done any drugs.  Prior to this no physician has told me I have HBP or any issues for which I have to be medicated.  I take zero medications.  Even when I had the bad headache from the vaccine I took nothing.  I have not worked in two weeks and had not driven until last saturday.  If I don&#39;t work, I don&#39;t get paid.   I pay for almost $600/month for my insurance in the marketplace.  This has been another stressor of this storm.  Getting providers to really listen and insurance companies to take situations like this seriously.   I could not drive at night.  This has been rough and I look forward to being myself soon.  This reaction felt like a heart attack/stroke with extreme fatigue, acid reflux, cough with some blood, muscular pain.  The rash and headaches were the least of my concerns.  I am not yet recovered from all of this.  I sure hope there is no permanent damage and that this too shall pass.  It is important to note that I have tried reporting this event several times to the VAERS website online.  I completed the 4-5 pages multiple times and it would not let me submit.  I also called the VAERS 1-800 number to report and they told me to go back to the online form.  I left several messages when I could not get it done online and to this date no one has called me back.  I called to report my adverse reaction and they told me they do not take that info.  I also called the health dept.  After several phone calls to them a nurse called me back but did not take a formal report.  When someone is feeling pretty sick, this is a lot to ask of.  I persisted because I feel this is important to be reported.

                                                immediate symptoms - bowel movements are very different and continue to this day. Like babies poop. Specific date of occurrence 3/24/2021 - 2 pm: was standing in my home office feeling just fine and then my heart started racing and I was immediately nauseous to the point I had to lay on the floor on my back and tell myself to breathe.  I felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest, so I got up and grabbed my wrist blood pressure monitor and went and lay back on the floor telling myself to breathe. I took the first reading and it said 200/52/57  so I too it again 199 / 50 / 58.  I started to panic and remembered I had bought some cans of oxygen for my father and had one in the bathroom. I went and breathed on that for about 2 minutes. My reading then went back down to a more normal range. Since that time my head doesn&#39;t feel the same and it scared me enough to tell my husband and mom, yet they both told me not to stress about it. I have only experienced ongoing bowel movements and the weird head feeling since that time but did contact my Dr. for an appointment. I want be certain I didn&#39;t have a stroke or something peculiar.   I had noticed my heart rate increasing but wasn&#39;t sure if I was imagining it, so I restarted taking my blood pressure numbers on 3/22. My blood pressure that morning at 6 am was 113/59/72.

My throat and tongue and soft palate were covered in blisters. They were very painful and it was hard to swallow. She recommended seeing my dentist. They both thought it was a viral infection. I was prescribed a mouth rinse Chlorohexidine and recommended combination of Mylanta and Benadryl.  After almost two weeks I just have one blister left on the side of my tongue but the rest are healed up. I have no more pain.

                                                On April 4th, I woke up in the morning with a severe headache, nauseated, and chilly. Those symptoms lasted about 8-10 hours. I was having horrible neck and back pain that I couldn?t lift my head or neck the pain went down right shoulder into arm, hand, and fingers (pointer, ring, middle - tips of fingers were numb). Three days after that I started experiencing tongue, mouth, and lips numbness. They were numb and then the numbness just faded away. By Thursday of that week the NP in my office where I work ordered me a round of steroids and muscles relaxers, but it did nothing. I went and saw my PCP  around mid-April for right arm and shoulder aching and he ordered an X-ray and Physical Therapy. He ordered the x-ray to rule out presumed pinched nerve. I am currently doing the Physical Therapy. I still experience pain it?s getting better but still not 100%.

I might have had some tingling, but nothing too bad. 2 days before May 20th, 2021, I started feeling nervous then I went to ER, due to feeling lack of oxygen , I was  disoriented, dizzy, fainting type of dizzy. I could not breathe, I laid down and I could not breathe and my hands were tingling, then it went away at ER, but then it came back. After that my feet were tingly for days on and then my eyes were twitching, this was 4 days after the ER, 1 week, now I am recovered. I still have some abdominal pain.

                                                No immediate reaction day of vaccination. By evening had an increase in mast cell symptoms including, dizziness, nausea, severe headache, stomach pain, mild chest pain, fluish feeling, very fatigued.  Also severe left leg pain in calf (not a normal mast cell symptom for me). Symptoms still very prevalent by April 13, leg pain was worse, now in both legs. Saw primary physician Dr. He saw no swelling in legs and no treatment done at this time. April 18th headaches and leg pain was so severe went to ER. They ran a D Dimer test to test for blood clots and it was normal. Spoke with my mast cell specialist, Dr. by phone on April 19th and he prescribed 40 mg Prednisone daily for 5 days. Started prednisone on April 24th. When treatment course was finished my mast cell symptoms came back even worse than before, Had throat swelling, in addition to above symptoms. Went to Urgent Care on May 2nd, and they prescribed 60 mg Prednisone for 5 days. After this course of treatment, same thing happened,symptoms returned. Dr. suggested I follow up with my primary physician to make sure there wasn&#39;t something else going on besides mast cell symptoms. Dr. ran blood tests on May 14th,  including another D Dimer which was negative. Since tests were normal Dr. prescribed a long term taper of Prednisone which I am currently on as of June 9, 2021. Saw Dr on June 1st for follow up. Continuing prednisone taper for an additional 3 weeks. Symptoms as of June 9, 2021-still very sick. I still can&#39;t eat foods I was eating prior to vaccination, worsening of mast cell symptoms and leg pain is now mild and intermittent which is better. Still have headaches but they are not as severe as they were.

I wasn&#39;t able to hold my grandbaby because I just felt very weak. As time went on I had a very bad cough that I couldn&#39;t get rid of. I went to the hospital and I also experienced a sharp pain in my body. I was prescribed some medication to prevent the coughing, this helped some. A couple days later, I couldn&#39;t keep up anything I ate. My coughing was very painful , and was told I probably caught a cold. I was diagnosed with acute hypoglycemia. The hospital also did call to check up on me after. I am just now getting rid of the cough which was around June 9, 2021. The fatigueness has not gone away.

Short term memory/brain fog has been an issue. I&#39;ve had massive migraines. Complete body aches - even my bones hurt. The worse one was on  both of my arms  - above the wrist - and it was horrible (mostly on the right). One big blur of pain - I&#39;m in a lot of pain all the time. I have a constant headache. I keep losing consciousness and that started after the vaccine. It use to hit every three hours. Now it&#39;s more than that.  I have been two ERs in the couple of weeks. I&#39;ve been to the doctor, too. I am referred to a neurologist - can&#39;t get me in until middle of July. I pass out and when I wake up from it I am in excruciating pain - my whole body hurts. I can only take Tylenol because I&#39;m on Warfarin. I use Tylenol as needed and ice pack and heating pad for the pain. I started to almost lose consciousness when I have been completing this but I&#39;m okay - it is like a blanking out of the moment.

At the doctor?s office they told me I got tested for  Covid and was positive.  I came back home and infected my husband with Covid.  I also noticed my left foot and from my knee down to my foot, there is inflammation and are doing exams for blood clots and arteries to check why my foot is inflamed.  I also have upper palate is also inflamed and my gums and upper palate bleeds out which I have gone to a dentist and gave me some antibiotics to see if my inflammation and bleeds go down.  I would like an explanation of why this symptoms are happening to me.  My doctor thinks my symptoms are related to the J&amp;J vaccine.

                                                Vertigo, nausea and loss of hearing in right ear starting April 28, 2021.  I took a Claritin thinking that might help with the vertigo, it did not.  I contacted my doctor April 29th and he prescribed over the counter Mecilizine, which I took but it did not help with the vertigo. I made an appointment to see an MD, as my MD was out of the office, on Monday May 3rd. He prescribed Fluticasone, sinus rinse, and mucinex.  I took these for 7 days with no relief from the dizziness or hearing loss.  I contacted my MD again and he scheduled a hearing test which showed Moderate hearing loss in right ear.

Heart palpitations mostly when lying down.  Felt like it was skipping a beat.  That was intermittent and last less than a minute at a time.  Has calmed significantly.   3.  I had routine bloodwork done 11 days after vaccine and my cholesterol had jumped from in the 130-140 range to 193.  Retested in June and it is back down to 156.  Went to doctor on April 23, 2021 as routine not a result of any symptoms.  Went to Cardiologist on June 8 because I was concerned about the palpitations (did not feel life threatening but wanted it checked out) and the increase in the cholesterol

This lasted for approximately 36 hours.  The evening of the day one day after (March 12), felt symptoms of a minor cold in the nose (itchy, drippy, tangy taste) which moved to chest cold symptoms the following morning (March 13), also minor.  Those symptoms lasted about 24 hours then subsided.

                                                The day I received the shot, my arm got warm and sore.  The soreness traveled to my shoulder and neck.  I got headachey, alternating between hot and cold chills, a little bit of nausea and extreme tiredness.   This continued for the next 5 days which seemed like they were considered mild reactions according to the CDC website.  Most concerning though, is on day 5, (3/14/21) in the evening as I was getting into bed, I started getting a red, extremely itchy rash on both my arms, my lower back and my upper legs, to the point that I could not sleep because it was so itchy and had to take Benedryl.  I have not changed anything in my diet or in the products I use on my body, so I can only attribute this reaction to this vaccine.  I am still a little itchy on my arms today 3/15/21.   I am also still getting the hot and cold chills and still have a little bit of nausea, not bad, but enough to be &#34;off&#34; certain foods.

                                                The patient was screened and was found to have multiple medical allergies but no allergies to any of the components to the Janssen vaccine.  As a precaution, the nurses advised a 30 minute observation.  She received the vaccine without complication and then was being observed and they called me over and the paramedics were also with the patient.  About 17 minutes into observation, the patient started developing chest pressure (4/10), lightheadedness, and nausea.  No shortness of breath, stridor, diaphoresis, back pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, neurologic changes, and any signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis.  She was very anxious.  Further history revealed that the patient had been discharged from the hospital 6 week prior.  She initially went in for an abdominal laproscopic surgery and woke up to having 32 staples closing an abdominal incision.  They had to change from a laproscopic approach to an open abdomen approach due to complications.  She ended up with sepsis and a colostomy and was hospitalized for 2 weeks getting antibiotics.  She lives by herself and was overwhelmed before coming into the clinic for her vaccine.   The paramedics did a 12-lead ECG that showed sinus rhythm.  Vital signs and blood glucose were within normal limits.  The paramedics recommended that she go to the hospital to be checked out but she was very resistant and was tearful because she was traumatized from her previous hospitalization.  After some time, the paramedics convinced her to go to the hospital.  The paramedics hung around the emergency department and then came back once they found out that she was fine.

However, around 7pm, I began having cold chills &amp; feverlike symptoms. I knew there would be side effects, so I wasn&#39;t worried.  Later, around 8:45pm, it was everything I could do to stand up right and all I wanted to do was go to bed with ALOT of blankets on. I felt like I was going to vomit throughout the next several hours. Around 3am, I was throwing up and had diarhea. I had a massive headache as well. I had several rounds of extreme vomiting for the rest of that morning, but they were just dry heaves by then.  My head hurt so bad, I was worried.  I continued to vomit several more times that day and slept on &amp; off

                                                Day after (Friday) - body, head, stomach aches.... even my gums ached. Exhaustion. Day two - body aches and weakness (no food on Friday) Tired. Day three - Tired after walking the dog, napped and then tightness/ache in chest/lung area which continued throughout the night. I could not lie on my side or it would trigger the ache in my chest. I could breathe deeply but that also triggered the tightness. Day four (Monday) - Chest ache continued. Contacted doctor&#39;s office. Took a Tylenol that seemed to help a little and watching my blood pressure.

Then came the horrible headache causing nausea and dizziness which ultimately resulted in causing me to pass out while attempting to get to the couch. Once I came to the body trembles  started accompanied by being freezing cold. The headache and diarrhea lasted into the next day with symptoms not lessening until day 3. Still have to take Tylenol every 4 hours to keep headache manageable.  I did not seek medical treatment but would strongly warn those getting this shot of the possible  loss of consciousness. It came on very fast, 8 hours after the injection,  and could be deadly if someone was driving or not near soft surroundings.

                                                In the middle of the night of the 10th of April I started having what seemed like normal side effects---muscle aches, headache, fatigue.. and then all day on the 10th the same side effects.   Then last night I slept 9 straight hours but woke up  sweating a couple times in night and in morning woke up sweating but my aches and headache seemed better than the day before so I went downstairs to make tea.  After pouring a glass of orange juice and having a couple sips I started to feel strange --dizzy and oversome with a strange feeling that was not quite like the feeling before fainting -- my back had a weird pain and i was a little nauseous as well. ..it was more overwhelming -- more loss of control like a huge wave of dizziness and ringing.  I made my way to a couch to try to regain balance -- but was still very dizzy-- something happened to make me try to get up and go upstairs so I remember walking 12 feet or so then told myself to sit down.  Before that happened I must have blacked out.  I faintly remember moving myself across the floor but then must have blacked out again.  I woke up at the base of the stairwell and then was able to walk upstairs.    I had collapsed the first time onto a hard floor as my orange juice glass had spilled all over and when I got upstairs my sweatshirt was covered in juice.  I don&#39;t remember any of that.  Once upstairs I drank water and have been fine since then.  I had eaten dinner the night before but maybe it was the sweating in the night that dehydrated me and i cramped up and had a strange pain in my back---i don&#39;t know.  I am a very healthy 56 yr old woman 5&#39;3&#34; 105 lbs so maybe the Johnson and JOhnson one dose was a lot for my body or maybe my body was just doing what it&#39;s supposed to do to react to vaccine.... i also may have had asymptomatic covid in the last year so my body was overreacting.   This happened 7 hours ago and I seem fine aside from slight headache and continued weakness from vaccine but I thought I should report the incident in case there might be something more or in case others had similiar responses.

EMS took blood pressure it was 93/50 hear rate was very low. Called ambulance and advised I go to hospital immediately.  Blood pressured jumped to 150 then dropped again.  Once in ambulance they put IV in and gave Zofran through IV, I don&#39;t know if they put anything else in there.  Blood pressure stabilized around 110 which is normal for me, I normally have low blood pressure and heart rate.  Nausea and dizziness dissipated by the time I got to hospital.  They put EKG on also while I was in ambulance and said I was having PVC&#39;s advised dr to do another EKG once I got to hospital.  Felt better by about 5:00 PM.  Overnight I had slight fever and body aches, took Advil and symptoms subsided.  Slight soreness in arm and armpit, but not major.  Have been feeling fine now other than being traumatized by the whole event.

                                                The evening following the shot - chills, sweating, muscle achiness, headache, fatigue   approximately  the week prior to March 27 I was very very very fatigued.   the following week still fatigued.  I felt a weird sensation near my heart that was only momentarily - like a bubble or something about 1/4 inch in length move through a vein near my heart - I think I felt it again near my stomach a few days later - weird.  and then my face felt like I was losing sensation - like it was tingling .  that lasted a little longer, like a sagging.  I thought maybe I put on weight.  i was concerned and went to pharmacy to get my blood pressure taken - which I have never done in my life.  I am 56!  They no longer do that bc of COVID - so I asked a nurse friend to take it. She measured 124 over 60 something.  that is high for me.  I am typically 106/62.  I checked my records.  I started running then - in case I have put on weight.  I am 155 (high).  But now I started getting a constant headache about a week ago.  I am in a new job - so have thought it was due to stress or I reactivated a concussion  headache.   i started taking  Ecotrim 2 everyday now.  I am NOT an aspirin taker and I do not get headaches.  I try not to take ibuprofen for the headache.  I am not sleeping.  I have slept well ALL my life up to now.  I go to bed late now like 11;30 and I don&#39;t sleep.  I have a lot on my mind.  so it could be that.  Under a lot of stress.  this just started the last week.  A very new pattern.  I started a new job 3/15/21.  I was drinking coffee for the first 2 -3 weeks and now am not drinking it.  I don&#39;t drink much alcohol but I have had 1 glass of wine on the weekend or beer.   I run about 3 miles 2-3 times a week.

I had a severe reaction - chest pain and back pain for the entire day.  I alerted Drs., but I&#39;m sure it should be reported.  I took my ZyrtecD prior to vaccine, which I&#39;m sure helped in some manner.  I was better on Friday with lingering back pain.  Today I am down with bad headache and stomach pain, but I am aware there is a current stomach bug.

Sometime between 2:30-3:00 am I think I fell asleep, but between 4:00-6:30am I was sweating profusely, and finally got up at 7:00am to change my bed sheets and clothesjust soaking

Terrible headache that eventually turned into serious migraine.  Asked pharmacist, next morning if it was allowed to take an Imitrex injection for migraine after having vaccine.  Pharmacist said it was ok to take injection. Helped reduce migraine enough to be in bed resting the rest of that following day. Recovered and back to normal by next day the 25th. With Janssen vaccine concern now with cerebral clotting with severe headache as a sign, decided to report bad side effects and make sure I shouldn?t be having anything else checked for precaution.

                                                Five days 18 hours after receiving the Janssen vaccine shot, I awoke with an unusual and very painful headache. Having only been asleep for about two hours, I didn&#39;t want to get up and tried to rearrange myself for relief. Getting slight relief, I did fall asleep again after moving around and drinking water over about an hour. I awoke two hours later (about 10:00 AM) with almost unbearable head pain throughout my head, not localized to one area. I drove to fast food restaurant, having a difficult time driving due to pain, and got a half-sweet tea. Tea, having caffeine and some sugar, can often relieve a headache. It didn&#39;t offer the relief I expected and about 30 minutes later, I vomited up the tea. I was at that same time ordering a sandwich and detox smoothie, thinking the detox smoothie may help. It seemed to after a couple more hours, but I continued to feel like the headache was still barely there and waiting to return. I ate very well and clean all day, but even late in the evening, I cod feel remnants of a headache. The next morning, 4/12, I awoke again with that same horrible headache, but maybe just slightly less excruciating than the day before. I did not vomit. After a few hours of eating, drinking water, and taking aspirin with Tylenol, the headache subsided.

No issues at all until 11 p.m., started with sudden onset high fever (103), shaking chills, mild short-lived nausea, and immediate thumping splitting headache and very severe body aches and joint pain.  In bed until 12 noon the next day  feeling terrible.  On couch rest of day with fever fluctuating from 100.3 to 101.1. Went to bed 4/13/2021 with 101.1 fever, woke up 5-6 times drenched in sweat (fever trying to break?) and then was able to get out of bed, fever resolved.  Still achy and puny on 4/14/2021 but much better.  I took NO medications during the side effects/adverse events from the J&amp;J vaccine.  I do have significant left arm pain at the injection site still on 4/14 but there was no redness, warmth, or rash at the site, arm looks completely normal.    Very typical flu like reaction.

My husband put me on the phone on Friday night April 9 with    They took all of my information (name, phone #, address, email, vaccination information and location, symptoms).  They said they searched the database and could not find my matching reaction symptoms. They offered no guidance.  The next day I passed blood through my anus without stools.  I was still in pain and soreness for a few more days.  I called the  again on Tuesday to report the blood.  They claimed to not be able to find my original report in the system.  They seemed not to care which really upset me. I did not fill out a new report with them as I felt I would just be wasting my time.

I had dysphagia.  Earlier in the week I had two bad headaches but dismissed them as work.

For days later, I began to feel, ill all over and could not get out of bed.  I had severe abdominal pain, aches and pains all over my body.  Particularly in places where I had pre existing conditions.  As the day progressed, I continued to have severe GI issues, could not eat (pain like food was stuck) heart burn, constipation (clamy like flu).  Shortness of breath, I could not walk far.  I took 3 trips to the ER where they treated for the abdominal spasms, UTI, and pain.  By the end of the week I had a slight fever.  I tested negative for COVID during that time.  For two weeks I was unable to eat, get out of bed.  I had several petite mal seizures.  If felt like my body was fighting the vaccine and the vaccine was attaching all of me weak or any preexisting conditions.  Eventually, after 3.5 weeks I was able to sit up, and walk. I still have shortness of breath, some fogginess,  Muscle strain, walking with a cane and a lump at the injection site.

Given her use of Coumadin with described severe headache, head CT was obtained.  This did not reveal any acute pathology.  Patient was treated with a combination of IV fluids, IV Reglan, IV Benadryl, oral Valium, scopolamine patch, IV Haldol, IV magnesium, IV Decadron for combined dizziness and headache.  She reported complete resolution of headache thereafter.  She was able to ambulate midway through her emergency department visit but later reported intractable dizziness for which she felt uncomfortable being discharged.  As such, general medicine was contacted for observation admission to obtain MRI to rule out posterior infarct and continue treatment for her intractable dizziness.  MRI obtained 4/18 with and without contrast showed no evidence of acute infarct and no evidence of active demyelinating lesions.  Findings compatible with known history of multiple sclerosis with supratentorial demyelination.  There was no of opacified right maxillary sinus for which she will continue Flonase.  Patient was seen by physical therapy who felt she was safe for discharge as she was able to ambulate independently without persistent dizziness.  PT and Care Management arranged for in-home physical therapy 3-5 times per week.  Prescriptions for Antivert and Zofran provided for presumed peripheral vertigo.  Did discuss the possibility of current symptoms being related to Janssen COVID 19 vaccination on March 25th, although I did convey this seemed unlikely to patient and her brother.  Patient is to follow up with her primary care doctor and was provided strict return precautions.  in 4/20/21 phone call f/u with RN Care Manager pt reports ongoing dizziness, headaches including new onset diarrhea.

                                                At approximately 2AM on Thursday, a severe headache (I would term a migraine based on prior experience) woke me. I had no apparent fever, but my body was stiff and I felt my heart rate was elevated. I drank some water, in case it was dehydration-related, but was unable to fall back asleep. I also experienced some nausea at breakfast but ate toast and had some (caffeinated) tea about 6 AM. Around 7 AM I took two (2) ibuprofen, which dulled the headache slightly. However it persisted into early/late afternoon hours on Thursday. (My customary activities were curtailed somewhat.) Since I have had migraines in the past, I treated this as I treated those: hydrating, taking pain medication as required, remaining quiet, reducing exposure to light and sound, etc. I continued taking two (2) ibuprofen periodically as I felt the need through bedtime Thursday night.  Friday I had periodic headaches (again, attributed them to rebound migraines or just headaches), felt tired, and been a bit &#39;out of it&#39;. But my systems did not prevent me from functioning. I did repeat the two (2) ibuprofen on Friday night at bedtime.

I also had a covid test because of how I was feeling and the test was negative.  I had an u/s of my right leg to check for blood clots. An x-ray of the chest was also performed. I also have had a bad cough since my vaccine which I can not get rid off.  I am still not feeling 100% from the vaccine, still tired, fatigued and diarrhea.   I do not have my lot #, but I will call back when I get that information.

                                                So I had the injection on 4/2 by the middle of the night I ended up having a high fever of 102, the headache - it started as a headache not a typical type, the body ache and nausea which came with the fever. When you have flu symptoms you feel crampy and weak and that was typical. I started to feel back to myself by the 9th of April. I couldn&#39;t workout, I was very weak, it almost felt like I had mono. On the 13th I started with the severe headache, almost migraine because different noises and light and the sensitivity, it was very uncomfortable to have my glasses on my face because of the pressure. I also started to tremble a lot, weakness muscle trembling like if I picked up a glass my whole body was shanking and it was very noticeable.   I didn&#39;t know if I picked up Covid from being in the hospital even though I was double masked. I had a covid test and it came out negative and gave it to my Doctor and she advised I got to the Hospital because something was going on. On the 16-17 I was admitted to the hospital and they ran a bunch of tests. I had even though I was in the hospital I continued to be sick with these headaches all the way up to May 15th.  This is something I have never experience these continuous migraines, it was a long haul. The headaches have now tapered off and the trembling have gotten a little better, when I workout the muscles aren&#39;t as weak and trembling. When I go on my toes I still have a  little shaking, especially on my left side but it&#39;s not as severe as it was.

                                                I woke up around 1 am with chills and a low grade fever. This continued for the next 12 hours. For the following 24 hours I developed intense body aches, fatigue, headache, and slight dizziness. Overall the side effects lasted around 48 hours after injection. After that initial period there have been only minor instestinal discomfort and tiredness.

                                                I started experiencing chills and body aches approximately 12 hours after getting the injection.  I took my temperature (it was 99) and an Aleve. After the first 24 hours, my breathing became more shallow, and I had an increased hunger to add to the body aches.  I felt as if I had the flu.   At 36 hours after injection, I started having a head ache that caused me to be dizzy upon standing. I am making this report 46 hours after and I still have a slight headache and some nausea/excess saliva.

                                                Received injection on Sunday. Monday was nauseated and had chest pressure.  Nausea and CP came in waves and occurred about 10 times. Then stopped.   Felt &#34;off&#34; for 4 days.  Felt fine on Friday and through Wed 3/23/21 until 9:10 PM.  Developed visual changes in left peripheral bilat.  Appeared like waves in an arc.  Then began to not be able to breathe.  I had to tell myself to breathe.  Called squad, arrived 9:45pm.  BP 170/110, HR 118. By 10pm, the visual changes disappeared BUT developed chest pressure in same area as the MOnday after the vaccine.  Then became extremely nauseated, almost vomiting.  Nause came in waves for next 6 hours until it calmed down.  Then returned Wed am for several hours, again in waves along with hollow chest feeling and pain. Continued with headache off and on with brain fog the remainder of Wednseday 3/23/21.  Discussed with hospitalist at Hospital and was told to report it to the CDC as likely an adverse effect to the vaccine.  Was still in the 14 day window.     Thank you,  RN, PhD, MSN, MS, BSN

Crushing pain all over body, joints and muscles. Stabbing headache similar to a migraine. Dizziness. Diarrhea for 1 day; abdominal pain for nearly two weeks. Intermittent nausea for nearly two weeks. Felt like I had a fever, although the thermometer said 99.7. The feverish feeling lasted for 3 days. The crushing pain lasted for nearly two weeks. The dizziness was intermittent for two weeks. Got a full-blown migraine headache 4 days after vaccine. Please note: I did NOT take my nightly aspirin dose for 2 days prior to vaccine so as to not affect the immune response. I restarted my nightly dose at 11 PM,  6 hours following the vaccine. Still had all the above-mentioned symptoms.

                                                After my J&amp;J vaccine, my right arm felt hot and was red and I also ended up with an upset stomach, had diarrhea and felt sick to my stomach. I also experienced chills, low grade fever of 99.8 and had swelling to my joints in my fingers and toes. My right arm pain radiated upwards to my neck. These symptoms lasted 12 hours and as of today I still have pain in my neck. Since 03-15-2021, I have been seeing a chiropractor for my neck pain. I see him on a weekly basis. At the chiropractor&#39;s office they apply ice, heat and do a muscle rub help with my neck pain that still is present.

I slept 14hrs straight for two days after the shot.  Tired after walking down the driveway and back.  Entire body aching with excruciating pain but not the left arm where the shot was taken.  Headaches were bad as well.  No appetite.  The 3rd day afterwards I felt better but still very tired.  The 4th day still tired but better.  Tylenol, caffeinated coffee and lots of water seem to help me get through this.  The fifth day afterward, I am almost 100%  but dealing with running nose and eyes which may not be related to the shot.

Patients breathing was fine, but she was extremely lethargic/limp. Was coherent but slow to answer questions, excessively sweating and pale, small amount of vomit. At one point, patient said that she did not know where she was. Said that her fingers felt numb and tingly (could not pick up water or orange juice...we had to put water and juice to her lips to drink). She said that she needed to lay down. Per patient she had oatmeal with very little sugar for breakfast and coffee. Believe the reaction was a vasovagal response.

This subsided by the morning of the 11th. On the 11th, patient experienced extreme fatigue, sensitivity to light and sound, and nausea. Monday the 12th, at 3am, patient was woken up to severe migraines (patient has no prior history of migraines or headaches). She described her pain as radiating-- like a bright, light house was being shined directly into her eyes in her sleep. This was combined with a pounding, pulsating feeling in the frontal lobe. Patient reported hypertension, nausea, and tingles in the tips of her fingers. These symptoms persisted throughout the day. On Tuesday the 13th, the same symptoms persisted. Patient heard the new CDC warnings about the Janssen vaccine, and concerned for her well-being, called her physician. Her physician directed her to go to the emergency room as soon as possible.

Severe facial/sinus pain on left side of face March 20 (approximately 48 hrs after vaccine) lasting about 24 hours. And then Mild facial/sinus pain on left side of face lasting another 24 hours. Used ibuprofin, meloxocam 7.5 mg, and extra strength tylenol to help relieve side effects. The first 7 hours after the vaccine none of the anti-inflammatory medications helped to relieve any side effects. The facial pain I experienced a day later was relieved somewhat with the anti-inflammatories.

                                                Headache everyday for a month after the vaccine.  Took Tylenol for pain.  Pain at base of skull.  Would hurt, at times so bad felt like I was going to vomit, but didn&#39;t.  Then it would go away for a while then return.  Was like this on and off everyday for a month.

                                                My issues initially started about an hour after the vaccine.  I became very subdued, no appetite and &#34;foggy&#34; for a lack of better words.  I attributed this to what others stated were &#34;typical reactions&#34; and did not make a fuss over it.   The following day I was VERY tired and stayed in bed and then about half way thru day 3, I became alert and resumed normal activity.  At day 13 I began to have upper thigh pain in my left leg and began to feel winded as I was would walk up steps and do housework which had not happened previously ever..  On 4/14/21 I requested an appointment with my primary care doctor, however he was booked for 2 weeks and I was referred to an associated PA  where I received a virtual consult.  He told me that I was &#34;over the age&#34; of the women that were having reactions ,even though I had requested a Doppler.  He only ran bloodwork, and in fact never even called me back on the bloodwork, and just posted it in the online profile.  My ankles are VERY swollen and have bluish pitting and my feet do have considerable pain.  I do have right side abdominal pain everyday since the 13th of April.  I now need to find a doctor that will run diagnostics and respect my concerns

                                                I tracked my symptoms in a notebook because they were so severe on Day 1. Day 1-3: sore arm, headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, foggy brain, unable to focus, chills/uncontrollable shaking for several hours, body aches. Day 4: Same symptoms as above but milder. Bleeding gums when brushing teeth on left side of mouth (this NEVER happens). Painful gums (does happen when very sick with a virus). Day 5-6: Feeling better, but tired. Day 7: Tired, headache, nausea following exercise. Day 8-12: Mild feeling of discomfort while peeing. Tired every day.  A bitt foggy every day but this happens with pollen season. Day 18: tired, trouble breathing on treadmill- I attributed this to pollen as it went away the next day when I closed the window. Day 20 (May 1): While out with friends, after having lunch and a glass of wine, I jumbled a few words and could not say them correctly. There were just about two words in two sentences. I tried a few times and they kept coming out wrong. It was nothing I have ever experienced before. We laughed it off but I felt very unsettled and a bit concerned about driving home. I drove home and was fine. I remain tired and feeling foggy which could be  due to pollen. I have scheduled an appointment with a clinician today and hope to have some blood work done.

                                                The first thing that happened, 4:30 pm the following day, extremely nauseated and starting throwing up (I was driving and had to pull over) and felt super dizzy which was vertigo. Drove home, had severe diarrhea , chills, fever. My arm swelled up and hurt. My lower back was in severe pain. My upper right back thigh - between the buttocks and knee had a horrible pain in it. Very severe pain and it started radiating down my calf muscle and then to the front of shin. Stayed for days on the back of my thigh in my right leg. I continued having very severe vertigo. I would have to run and throw up if I tried to move or go back to bed. The nausea never went away. That was lasted for 8 days. I went to my doctor&#39;s office - I drove to the office - they moved all the doctor&#39;s across town for Sutter and I couldn&#39;t make it before they closed and I had to go home. I couldn&#39;t make it. Just driving there was impossible - It was really bad. Didn&#39;t have  a doctor visit at all then. The dr. prescribed a medication for vertigo. The pharmacist said to buy the OTC medication for vertigo so I bought it but it didn&#39;t help. That made me doped up and sleepy but still nauseated. I got a spike behind my ear on the right hand side of head - in that little pocket - headaches would come there.  I still have weird vertigo and dizziness - intermittently- although I always have a dull nauseous feeling. Every now and then I have to run and throw up - it&#39;s like my body is tired of feeling dizzy. Flying in the airplane - looking out the window - made me super nauseous  - so I had to close my eyes and not look at anything. Still have the nausea and vertigo. I have mild dull headaches still. Did have golf ball size lump on arm and couldn&#39;t raise it but now it&#39;s gone.

After going to bed at 12 am, I awoke at 1:30 with hammer like pains in the right thigh, right head, and bottom of right foot. Later I awoke again at 5:30 am with a seizure like jerk. The next day I had stinging pain in my right side and the bottom of the right foot.  My heart raced and skipped beats and felt like it was flopping.  The oxygen deprived feeling  continued for 5 days. The hammer like pains subsided. I continued to feel nauseous and exhausted for 2 weeks after vaccination. The third week I was just very tired. It was such an terrible experience, I didn?t think I would live through it.

I missed 4 days of work.  I began feeling better a week after the vaccine.  24 days after the vaccine, I was awaken with excruciating pain in my left abdomen, and had severe diarrhea.  The diarrhea lasted most of that day, the pain continued.  I went to an Emergency Room on 4/1/21, and a CT scan revealed what appeared to be a stomach ulcer, a kidney stone and a post-menopausal ovarian cyst, all of which were causing the pain.  I have been through many tests and seeing a variety of doctors, and currently am awaiting results and treatment plans for the stomach problem and the ovarian cyst.  The cyst has grown and is causing continued pain.  The stomach issue is being treated with Sucralfate 1 g 4 times per day and Pepcid 20 mg.

                                                After vaccine was introduced felt slight swelling discomfort of left arm (had to remove and reseat my watch strap) followed by both arms seeming flushed (reddish).  Ignored both symptoms at the time. About 30 minutes after vaccine on my way home in the car throat started feeling swollen and I found it difficult to swallow. Lips and tongue felt swollen (even though they didn&#39;t loot it). Metallic taste in mouth and could smell a weird earthy smell. Went to ER to seek assistance, by the time I got to the ER symptoms were starting to subside.  Kept under observation for the rest of the afternoon before being discharged Prescribed an EpiPen and followed up with Primary Care Physician.  After about a week started feeling a pain deep in my right calf, no other symptoms so have not sought medical care.  Today 2 weeks after vaccine still have slight pain in calf, seems to be subsiding with time.

The following 4 days I felt lethargic and &#34;heavy&#34; slowly re-gaining my capacities until fully recovered.

I took Benadryl 1/2 hour after onset, eventually resolving hives and face swelling. 25 hours later, I&#39;m still experiencing the painful throat/swollen uvula issue. Appetite is fine, though swallowing is painful. Injection sight became painful 18-20 hours after vaccination.

                                                The most concerning was hallucinations.  I saw the tooth fairy and cried for santa.  I had a fever, chills so violent that I made the bed shake - lasted for hours; severe headache that triggered a migraine, exhaustion, and nausea.  It&#39;s 2 days later and I still feel terrible.  My husband gave me a tylenol PM that night and the next day as the headache was a full blown migraine, I took naratriptain.   I still have a slight headache but want to avoid taking additional medicine if possible.

                                                I felt fatigued all week. On the fifth day I felt like I had been kicked below the belly button. I had the same type of pain as Diverticulitis below the belly button on the left side.  My doctor suggested warm compresses and Tylenol for the pain and that helped a little.  Starting around day nine I have had some Diarrhea for two days so far.

                                                I felt fine immediately after the injection - just a little pain in the arm where I got the injection and when raising my arm. By 6:30 pm I was achy all over and my legs were aching a lot. When I went to bed around 8:00, I hurt all over (achy and flu-like feeling, but no fever). I dozed off and on and about midnight when I woke up, I had a very rapid heartbeat. This went on all night and into the morning. It was hard to get any sleep at all. When I&#39;d get up to go to the bathroom, I was slightly dizzy and unsteady on my feet. After I got up at 6:30 am, the highest my heartrate got was 113, then it finally began going down. I was still hurting all over, felt extremely tired, and now had fever - 99.8. The fever lasted off and on all day and into the next night. I was also very nauseated all day and I felt extremely bloated. I also had a bad headache. When I woke up on Friday, my fever and the headache was gone, but I felt extremely tired and weak and still nauseated. I slept most of the day and I still ached all over, but not as much. My lymph nodes were also swollen. On Friday afternoon, I walked up to the mailbox and I was winded and unsteady. On Saturday, I felt a little better, but was still extremely tired. By Saturday night, all the aches, pains and headache were back and I didn&#39;t sleep well at all. I rested most of Sunday and felt a little better Sunday evening. The aches and pains were going away, but I was still very tired and exhausted. I felt the same way when I woke up on Monday morning. It seemed like the vaccination made the aches and pains I normally had with Fibromyalgia about three times as bad as usual. And I was still very bloated feeling all over. By Monday afternoon the nausea finally went away. By Monday afternoon I was feeling a little better, but still tired. On Tuesday I felt better still and I noticed that I wasn&#39;t bloated as much. It seemed like I was getting back to normal.

I felt so bad all day that by 9pm I went to the ER and was advised my intestines were inflamed and diagnosed with Colitis.  I was prescribed Augumentin to take for 7 days and tylenol for pain and to follow up with my PCP.

                                                My left arm started to sting immediately after getting the shot, then the stinging subsided.  My left arm started to hurt later in the day and I had pain all the way down my left arm and left side of my chest. This pain throughout my left side was not helped by Ibuprofen and  made sleep very hard.  I had intermittent sharp pain in my neck, shoulder, and left arm for days.  The injection site turned red, hot, and a raised area the size of a silver dollar appeared  and was med-red in color for about 8 days.  The color is better/ almost normal as of today, but still a hard lump under the skin and a bit itchy.  This has caused pain throughout my back and shoulders since I got the shot....but it has not been activity limiting.  I had a slight bit of nausea for a couple of days as well.  My husband had his shot just after mine and experienced  Chills , headache, and nausea at about 9:00 P.M.  His chills subsided at about 3:00 A.M.  He continued with the headache for another day/ fatigue for 2 days/ and nausea for about 5 days.  He has also had tingling in his left arm (about 7 days)  and a funny tingling on his tongue for about a week.

Finally fell asleep around 5:30am still with a really bad headache.  Woke up at 11:00am.  Brushed my teeth and started to feel nausea.  I went back to my bedroom and I got lightheaded to where my vision was blurred.  Layed on the bed and felt really bad with a sweaty face and still nauseas.  Had someone bring me grapes and some tea and layed there.  I felt bad for about 45 min. then I fell asleep.  Got up about 3:30 hours later feeling better, but not 100%  Still a bit of a headache but nausea went away.  Today I feel back to my normal self.  I thought you&#39;d like to know I did experience some of the side effects for your records.

                                                (Janssen COVID-19 vaccine EUA ) I became ill a few hours after receiving the shot. The bones in my entire body ache (including my fingertips). I had a bad case of the chills. I spent the rest of the day and night bundled up under 3 layers of blankets. I lost my appetite but continued to drink water as directed by the Pharmacy staff. I felt back to normal when I awoke the next morning.

About 15 hours after the vaccine, I still had the headache, nausea,  dizzy,  and additional slight diarrhea, dry heaves, rapid heartbeat, and feeling very tired  and weak but went from chills to hot and sweating.   This lasted for about an hour and then it was back to body chills, headache, nausea, body fatigue for the next 24 hours.   My arm and injection site did not hurt, only if I would rub across that area of my arm.   I have still experienced the fatigue 60 hours after the vaccine.  Nausea has still come on different time during this time too.

Couldn&#39;t get warm for hours. Fever, but not super high. By noon the next day (24 hours) I was almost completely better. It felt similar to a mild case of the flu. Also want to note that I went straight to lunch from the vaccine and had a margarita with my lunch.

By far the worst headache I&#39;ve ever had. I sat in the shower for about 40 mins trying to get it to go away, it didn&#39;t. I took a Tylenol when I got out of the shower which I immediately vomited up . After a while I was drained enough that I was able to go back to sleep. Headaches continued for more than a week, though not as awful (I was more or less functional). On March 26th I requested an appt and was seen right away.

                                                I had been experiencing slight intestinal/abdominal discomfort for a week, continuing to increase during the few days prior to the acute event.  In the middle of the night, while trying to sleep, I was woken by intense and painful intestinal pain and cramping, followed by severe diarrhea and nausea and vomiting,  I also had a temperature of 100.5.  My chest and torso broke out in a red rash.   The temperature subsided after a day, and the severe diarrhea and vomiting subsided; yet the diarrhea continued.   The red rash continued for three days.     I had not eaten any different foods, nor had I gone anywhere out of my house , and did not have any visitors, since I had the J&amp;J vaccine.

                                                Was stressed and run down in weeks prior to shot (taking care of mother dying of cancer who passed 04//01/21) so was not able to determine if experiencing side effects of just continued fatigue. Sore arm, bruised. Monday evening 04/12/21 felt sick, nauseous. Unusual for me. Continuing to feel sick each day since then and called in sick to work today. When I move around I feel worse. My chest feels like I am on the verge of getting really sick. I can breathe but just do not feel good. Feel worse when having a conversation with people. Feel better resting. I have no fever. My blood pressure and heart rate are normal. This is the sickest I have felt since before the pandemic. I called a nurses hotline yesterday and was told to call 911 is I had chest discomfort. I do not feel sick enough to call 911 and could drive myself if I need to go to the hospital. Best way to describe my symptoms is feel like I am on the verge of getting a bad chest cold. Had a headache last night and did not take anything. Woke up in the middle of the night with a very painful headache and took 2 Tylenol which made the headache subside. I have been feeling worse each day since Monday. Today is Thursday. Am wondering if I have COVID-19 and have called a clinic to schedule a COVID test that will be paid for by my work. Am waiting for a return call. All I know is that I feel sick and was not feeling this way before having the vaccine.

                                                Pt c/o &#34;not feeling well&#34; about 5 minutes after receiving Janssen Covid-19 vaccine on 03/24/2021 at 10:17am. I immediately ran to her car. She was responsive but very pale. She c/o nausea, laid back in care seat and looked to have seizure activity, pulling her left arm up her chest and biting her lip. This lasted several seconds then pt was A&amp;O and in NAD. I yelled to nurse to call 911 and get other provider. HE arrived in 2 minutes. He checked pt&#39;s pulse and reported it to be weak and thready. He reported her O2 sat was 83%, but her hands were ice cold. Pt was still answering out questions at this point with no breathing difficulties. PA reported O2 sat back up to 93%. Pt&#39;s BP 122/62, HR 100 and RR 20.  EMS paramedics arrived in 5 mins. Pt A&amp;O x3 with paramedics and refused transport to local hospital ER for further evaluation and treatment. Paramedics confirmed pt was AMA. Our nurse dialed pt&#39;s husband on her cell phone. Pt talked to husband and told him to come get her.  Pt was able to move from driver&#39;s seat to passenger seat. Her husband picked her up 30 mins later. I continued to check on pt until her husband arrived. Pt remained A&amp;O x3 with NAD.

To this day I am still dealing with the headache, the pain not just in the arm but allover, gastro intestinal problems. It has impacted my sleep tremendously because the level of pain is very high. The one thing that went away that very first night was the low fever.  But this vaccine is like a Wish (cheap store) Vaccine. They SHOULD NOT give this to immunocompromised people and the &#34;few days&#34; rhetoric does not apply to us and that should be specified! Initially I thought this was to be expected when I heard a Doctor on the news say: &#34;if you fell like you got ran over by a truck, that is normal.&#34; So,  that is how I felt, so I thought it was normal.

I woke up with a swollen juggler vein that ended up being a blood clot, 10 days later my arm was swollen up twice the size of my leg, the juggler was still swollen. I call the urgent care nurse they said to go to ER. I went to hospital got a CAT scan and ultrasound, I was given a shot of warfarin that was supposed to last for 12 hours. I went home and the next morning instead of going to the hospital, I went to hospital and they found 2 blood clots in brain, arm and leg and neck. I have had no history of blood clots and this all happened after the J&amp;J vaccine. They did a procedure where they tried to put a balloon to relieve the pressure. The blood clots in the brain cannot be removed because of their location and it would be dangerous to remove and I am on blood thinners for the rest of my life. Multiple blood clots in body brain, arm and shoulder.

                                                I previously reported that 8 hours post vaccination I had severe teeth-chattering chills, severe muscles spasms throughout my body and aching of every joint.  That stopped after 5 hours at which time I felt like I was on fire from the inside.  Several hours that later and I developed a headache, nausea and diarrhea.  I took my temperature upon arising and it was 100.3.  I was fatigued.  The headache then diminished by 24 hours post vaccination.  I continued with abdominal upset, bloating, loose bowels, fatigue and fluctuating fever for 9 more days.  On day 17 post vaccination, I had a medical appointment at which time my BP was taken.  Because I always had good BP, I do not monitor it between medical visits.  It was 178/96.  I had never had high BP.  I always ran 120/80 or below.  I bought a BP cuff and checked it again later that day after resting.  The BP increased that evening to 188/101.  I made an appointment with my PCP the next day.  At that time, my BP was 188/110.

Initial information was received on 27-APR-2021, with additional information obtained via telephone follow up from the physician on 29-APR-2021. The patient&#39;s specific height and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included fatty liver, and the patient was overweight.  Family history was significant for a deep venous thrombosis treated with anticoagulants in the patient&#39;s mother, and a history of unspecified blood clots in her maternal grandmother. The patient was on no medications, including no estrogen containing pharmaceutical products or supplements. She has never been exposed to heparin. The patient had no history of COVID-19 infection. The patient received COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S (suspension for injection, route of administration not reported, batch number not reported) on 12-APR-2021. The batch number has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported. On 18-APR-2021, 6 days after receiving vaccine, the patient developed a headache. On 23-APR-2021, 11 days after receiving vaccine, the patient presented to the hospital with complaints of headache and abdominal pain. COVID test in the emergency room was negative. On 23-APR-2021, imaging of the head and abdomen revealed:  left sigmoid sinus vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, splenic vein thrombosis, superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, left internal jugular vein thrombosis.  The patient also had thrombocytopenia, with platelet count on presentation 22,000 (units not provided).  D-dimer was elevated at &gt;12.8 (units not provided), Fibrinogen was low at 103 (units not provided), HIT antibody test by ELISA was positive, and physicians made the diagnosis of Vaccine-induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT). The patient was hospitalized in the intensive care unit. Treatment medications included argatroban, steroids and IVIG.  Following treatment, the platelet count remained low, with a nadir of 17,000. On 27-Apr-2021, she underwent thrombectomy and thrombolysis of the intra-abdominal clots. This was performed due to the potential for portal hypertension in the future, given the extent of the thromboses. Repeat CT venogram of the head on an unknown date, revealed resolution of the sigmoid sinus vein thrombosis; the internal jugular thrombosis persisted. The patient has steadily improved since the thrombectomy. Abdominal pain and headache are improving.  Platelet count has steadily risen, to 138,000 on 29- Apr-2021. Her transaminases were slightly elevated on admission and have not worsened, and she appears to have no organ dysfunction. A dialysis catheter had been placed in the event she would require plasmapheresis, but this was never used.  Additional laboratory data included: IgG and IgM antibodies against the SARS-COVID-2 nucleocapsid protein positive; Protein C deficiency negative; Protein S deficiency negative; Homocysteine level (NR: not provided) negative.  Serotonin release assay, anticardiolipin panel and Factor V Leiden tests were pending. The plan was to transition the patient to an oral anticoagulant and remove the dialysis catheter on 30-APR-2021, with a possible discharge on 01-MAY-2021. The patient had not recovered from left sigmoid sinus vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, splenic vein thrombosis, superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, and left internal jugular vein thrombosis, and was recovering from left sigmoid sinus vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, headache and abdominal pain.  This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Life Threatening).  Additional information was received from physician on 29-APR-2021. The following information was updated and incorporated into the case narrative: patient history, disease course, events, outcome, lab data, concomitant drugs.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This spontaneous report concerns a 58-year-old female patient who experienced left sigmoid sinus vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, splenic vein thrombosis, superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, left internal jugular vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, headache and abdominal pain, 11 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S.  The patient is overweight and there is a family history of clots in her mother and maternal grandmother. Imaging of the head and abdomen revealed multiple sites of thrombus formation, platelet count was 22,000, D-dimer was elevated at &gt;12.8 (units not provided), Fibrinogen was low at 103 (units not provided),  and HIT antibody test by ELISA was positive. Physicians made the diagnosis of  Vaccine-induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT).  The patient was treated with argatroban, IVIG, and steroids.  Platelet counts remained low and she underwent thrombectomy of the intra-abdominal thrombi.  Following thrombectomy the platelet counts rose and abdominal pain began to improve.  Lab data included a positive test for IgG and IgM antibodies against the SARS-COVID-2 nucleocapsid protein.   Based on the evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS, per definition from Brighton Collaboration), the low platelet count and temporal relationship to vaccination, we consider the events to have a plausible relationship with vaccination.

                                                About a month later I started having odd symptoms.  I notice changes in my urinary and bowel functions.  Having to void often and more wet bowels on a weekly basis.  Shortly after I started to feel weakness in my thighs and periodically in my upper arms.  Overall weakness and stamina are not normal.  Also considerably fatigued.  Not happening every day but multiple times within a week.  Often 2 to three days feeling like above and 3 to 4 days of somewhat normal but stamina is slowly getting less than before.  Typically I can walk 3 to 4 miles 5 times a week, lift bags for yard work, not get winded on stair.

                                                I was at work and all of a sudden my lower abdomen started bloating and it was very painful. Within seconds I started feeling nauseous and my mouth filled with saliva. I started to feel faint. I left work 30 minutes early. I had to take my pants off and put on pajama pants because that is the only thing that would fit me. The pain from my abdomen was around my female organs. I laid down and my quads started to ache and I developed a fever. I did take some Tylenol which helped with the pain. I took Tylenol all week. My abdomen was still swollen come Friday and I developed brain fog. I was really having trouble recalling my normal daily routines and people I work with. This lingered on for 3 weeks. My head feels clear now, but I am still having trouble remembering normal daily activities and recall.

I went to the ER and had a MRI. Then I was diagnosed with Vertigo Syndrome. I was sent home. I went to see my doctor a couple of days after that. The doctor told me I will gradually get better. A few weeks later, I went to a physical therapist. I was given some exercises to do to speed my recovery. I am still not completely over it. I still get dizzy and I get very tired.

                                                On 04/21/2021, 12 days after I received the vaccine, I woke up with my entire left side feeling numb and I had a headache. I felt like I had pressure on my chest and I was really lightheaded. I got up for a little while and I felt like I was going to faint. I felt like I needed to eat something and I was very weak. I drank some juice and ate an orange. I was having a hard time swallowing and at times slurred my words. I realized that something serious was going on because I had pain like when I went through chemo. The base of my spine has been hurting every day since I received the vaccine and I have had headaches since as well. I was having heart palpitations and felt super weak. I didn&#39;t go to work for 2 days. That was 04/21 and 04/22. On 04/23 I had to do a zoom conference for work, for an hour, and my eyes starting hurting really bad like my eyes had been open for 24 hours. The light from the computer screen was really affecting me. At 5pm I did a tele-video appointment with the NP. She told me that she wanted me to go urgent care because it was the closest urgent care to me. After going to Urgent Care on 04/24, the doctor wanted me to go to the Hospital by ambulance. At the hospital the performed an EKG, CTA and MRA and they said that everything looked fine. They couldn&#39;t validate that my pain was from Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I was release at 10:30pm PT, I called Dr., my Oncology surgeon, and he referred me to Neurology doctor. I got an appointment with Dr., 04/27, and she ordered a CTA and an MRA. I had the scans completed on 04/28, with and without contrast. The radiologist found something. I was sent back home, but I was told that right vertebral artery was completely excluded. In January of 2020, there was a CTA performed, and I didn&#39;t have any numbness and my vertebral artery still have a steady flow even though there was a tear. It also showed that I had more stenosis in my carotid artery. I have now been referred to a new Neurosurgeon. Dr. never saw me because they couldn&#39;t view my records. The doctor told me to take Crestor and 81 mg aspirin. I did not feel that those medications helped at all. If anything, I felt worse. on 05/15, I was in the passenger seat of my grandson&#39;s car and I ended up throwing up and there was blood coming out with the vomit. He took me the Hospital. I had a video appointment on 05/11, with an NP, and she told me to up my aspirin to 325mg and continue to take Crestor. She referred me to The Stroke Neurology Group and she referred me to get a CTA. She also referred me to a GI doctor. On 05/15, against medical advice, and was taken by ambulance to another hospital. I stayed there until 3AM 05/16. They performed an MRA, a CT, Stroke Angiogram, they MRI with and without contrast, a chest x-ray and a lot of blood work. They also performed are lactate test and at first it came back as 2.5, which made them think I had an infection, but they re-tested and it came back as 1.5 which they said to be normal. The results from the hospitals. On 05/19 I went to see a Cardiologist, and she took me off of Crestor and put on pravastatin. She order an echocardiogram and a treadmill test and an EKG. I did see a GI doctor and they told me that the aspirin that I was told to take is what was making me throw up blood. I do have a neurology appointment on 06/11 and I have an appointment with the neurosurgeon on 06/16. My last heart test came back normal.

Initial information was processed along with additional information on 04-JUN-2021. The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included vertebral dissection of right vertebral artery in 2000, hiatal hernia, chemotherapy, radiation, vertebral tear, 5 years of cancer drugs and stroke-like symptoms, and concurrent conditions included 2 times breast cancer survivor, non-smoker, and sulfa drug allergy cause night time swells in mouth and tongue. The patient experienced pain in base of spine when treated with pegfilgrastim for breast cancer. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 042A21A expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 in total administered at left arm on 09-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid, and pravastatin. On an unspecified date in 2021, the patient had elevated lactate level of 2.5 (unit unspecified) and was 1.5 (unit unspecified) on repeat and also had elevated chloride level was 110 (unit unspecified). The patient was dehydrated. On 09-APR-2021, the patient had left torso and both arms itching for 4 hours, started within half hour after received vaccine. On 10-APR-2021, the patient experienced pain in base of spine, which was exactly the same as when she received Neulasta during a previous cancer treatment regimen and patient experienced headache for 3 days. On 21-APR-2021, the patient woke up with left side numbness from head to toes, feeling like being choked as if like an allergy, felt heaviness in chest, within one hour patient felt shaky and like she was going to faint, felt dizziness/lightheaded and laid down for 2 days, later felt like her eyes were going to pop out of her head, was putting Refresh eye drops in her eyes and was having problems focusing her eyes (vision disturbances). The patient was only able to stay up for 2 hours, then had lie down because felt sick and weakness and had sever fatigue. All like stroke-like symptoms. The symptoms started on 21-APR-2021. The patient went to emergency room on 24-APR-2021 and discharged on same day. On 28-APR-2021, the patient had computed tomography scan and showed occluded right Vertebral artery. The patient had a computed tomography scan one year ago and there was no occlusion. They did a computed tomography scan that showed a same occlusion as on 28-APR-2021. On 28-APR-2021, the patient had stenosis of right carotid artery. The patient went back to emergency room on 15-MAY-2021 because she was throwing up blood and dizzy and she was told to go to emergency room. On 11-JUN-2021, she was going to see a stroke neurologist specialist a neurosurgeon 16-JUN-2021. On 15-MAY-2021, the patient went to emergency room and they re-performed a computed tomography scan and it showed an occluded right vertebral artery just as first scan did. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from left torso and both arms itching on 09-APR-2021, had not recovered from pain in base of spine, and stroke-like symptoms, and the outcome of heavy feeling in chest, feeling like being choked, felt shaky, felt sick, dehydration and throwing up blood was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This spontaneous report received from a patient concerned a 58-year-old female who experienced stroke-like symptoms and occluded vertebral artery 15 days after vaccine. Past medical history included vertebral dissection of right vertebral artery in 2000, hiatal hernia, chemotherapy, radiation, vertebral tear, 5 years of cancer drugs and stroke-like symptoms, and concurrent conditions included 2 times breast cancer survivor. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid, and pravastatin. On day 12 after vaccine, the patient woke up with left side stroke-like symptoms. The patient went to emergency room on day 15 and discharged on same day. On day 19, the patient had computed tomography scan and showed occluded right Vertebral artery. The patient had a computed tomography scan one year ago and there was no occlusion. She was discharged and evaluated by stroke neurologist. There is no report of thrombocytopenia to suggest thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Given the pre-existing history of vertebral artery dissection, there is a plausible alternative explanation for the event.

On the 4th day I woke up with stiffness in my left arm and underarm, and swollen glands. I went to the urgent care on the following morning, but the stiffness and swelling had started to retreat and has since disappeared. Soreness at the injection site for about two weeks after vaccine. It is still a bit tender to the touch, but does not bother me unless rubbed hard. There was also redness and tenderness and some itching at the injection site. I felt poorly enough (the fatigue, mostly), that I was not able to work for 10 days. At about the two week mark I finally had the feeling that I felt good!  I occasionally feel fatigued, but have been able to resume normal activities.

I took 1 Extra strength Tylenol at 4:00pm but it didn?t seem to help. At 7:00 pm I took 2 ibuprofen, again didn?t seem to help.  Finally fell asleep around  10:30 pm. Woke at 12:00am chills and body aches gone,fatigue,  headache and nausea remained- slightly diminished. Fell asleep and slept through until 7:00am, felt better with a  mild headache , fatigue, and upset stomach through the day(March 14).  Low energy and slight headache remain on March 15th.

During the 15 minute observation period, she expressed &#34;I don&#39;t feel good&#34; and endorsed nausea. Shortly thereafter at approximately 12:10 pm, she started to slouch and nearly fainted while sitting in a chair. She did not fall or hit any part of her body. She was easily aroused with a touch on her arm and responded to verbal questions within seconds (less than a minute). She denied trouble breathing or chest pain. She then reported nausea again and was offered a receptacle to vomit in if needed; however, she did not vomit. Patient was encouraged and instructed to sit on the floor to prevent injury in case of fall but she refused stating that she didn&#39;t think she would be able to get back up given her preexisting knee problems. Pharmacy staff offered her water, a fan, and opened windows. Her jacket was removed in order to monitor blood pressure/ pulse, which was not abnormal. Patient did not have any trouble breathing, rash, swelling, abdominal cramps, or mental status changes. She was contacted via phone a few hours later for follow up on the incident, at which time she denied any issues and reported feeling well.

I got up and walked back over to my waiting chair and my Husband got up and received his vaccine.    Besides the pain in my left arm,  I started feeling weird tingling sensations and spaced out.  When my Husband sat back down next to me,  my stomach had a burning sensation and I felt slightly nauseated.  Then I felt like I was about to faint.  My Husband and the Staff kept me from falling, The Staff brought ice packs to put on my neck.  They said I turned white and profusely sweat.   I don&#39;t remember all of it, my Husband filled in the blanks.  I started feeling better and we left @4:30.

I got the vaccine at 9am.  around 4pm that afternoon i started feeling sick.  by 7:30pm I was in bed thinking I was going die!   By midnight, I got up and tried to walk to the stairs but i was to weak to walk.  I could not sleep.  I was up for 36 hours!  I was nauseous, dizzy, weak, exhausted.  Every inch of my body had pain!!!  I was tingling all over.  I  had the chills until midnight.  My heart would race and then stop... then race again... I was having difficulty breathing!  I tried standing up but I couldn&#39;t.  I would have driven myself to the emergency room but I couldn&#39;t walk.  by noon the next day, my heart regulated, I was able to breath easier.  I was still exhausted and full of pain and tingling.  Today, I still have some pain, but no tingling.

The major fatigue, headache, and major nausea have continued from the date of receipt to today&#39;s date of 3/31/21 (13 days). The primary complaint is edema (swelling) which has made it so her shoes do not fit at this time and has been very discouraging to the patient. She has had similar responses to a Shingrix and Hepatitis A per the patient&#39;s statement as received from another pharmacy, but had recently recovered after months of diuretic (water-pill) therapy and appropriate electrolytes such as potassium.

The headache lasted a solid 24 hours almost to the point of vomiting even while taking 4 tylenol every 4 hours then my stomach was empty so I ate a few crackers, but that next night it was hard to go to sleep.  At night I suddently realized my forehead seemed larger than normal!  It really felt bigger and swollen  so I massaged it and could feel my layers of skin/dermis moving around I beleived it was the serum from the shot from all the prone position I was in for so long laying in bed.  Thankfully the next day all syptoms went away gradually and by the third day I was back to normal....at least I THINK my forehead has returned to normal so far as I can see or feel.

                                                About 6 hours after receiving the vaccine I started getting a headache and felt chills. I was on my way to a hotel before leaving for a flight the next morning and was driving. When I stopped driving and attempted to exit my car, I experienced dizziness and stroke like symptoms. My legs would not hold me up and I felt as if I would pass out in the road. I held on to the car for several minutes until the feeling abated somewhat. Then I made my way unsteadily into the  hotel building and had to sit down for several minutes. My heart was beating rapidly and I felt strange so I took one of my nitroglycerin and also took an extra 12.5 mg Coreg.  After being taken to my room, I laid on the bed and continued to feel  weak, lightheaded and became very nauseous. I got out my pulse oximeter and my pulse was 95.  I took another Coreg and it seemed to slow it down for a little while but again it started racing and I continued to be nauseous and broke out in sweats and my pulse got back up to 100. I took another nitroglycerin and a baby aspirin in case I was having a heart attack. Then I took another Coreg. My pulse rate finally slowed down. I slept intermittently until going to the airport at 5 a.m.  I still felt weak and nauseous and very tired.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 59 y.o. female who presents to the Urgent Care with COVID-19 (sick after receiving COVID vaccine x1week ago. Vomiting, headaches, nausea, chills)  HPI:  Patient presents today with complaints of nausea, vomiting, headache and chills intermittently over the past 1 week after receiving her 1st COVID 19 vaccination.  She states that she got the Johnson Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.  She states of then she has had an episode of vomiting daily some nausea.  She has also had a headache every single day as well as some constipation.  She denies any numbness or tingling, abdominal pain, diarrhea.  She states that she has been taking ibuprofen, Pepto-Bismol, and Tylenol for her symptoms with minimal relief.  She is drinking a lot of water as well.  Medical Decision Making:  No concerns for acute abdomen or neurological deficits are noted on exam today. Patient is reporting some symptomatic relief after receiving the Toradol injection today in urgent care. Educated the patient on the following: Zofran for nausea and vomiting. MiraLax and senna for any constipation symptoms.  Motrin and Tylenol for pain or fever. Drink plenty of fluids.  Follow up with PCP as needed. If symptoms worsen go to the emergency room such as you are not able to keep fluids down while taking the Zofran, if you develop any bloody stools, bloody vomit, or increasing abdominal pain.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Patient is a 59 y.o. female who presents to the Urgent Care with COUGH (cough, SOB, congestion, vomiting everyday until about 1PM. headache off and on. x 2 weeks (since covid vaccine))     HPI: Patient is a 59 y.o. female who presents to the urgent care with cough, shortness of breath, congestion, nausea and vomiting and intermittent headaches over the past 2 weeks.  Patient states that the symptoms started the day of her COVID vaccine.  She states that she receive the Johnson&amp;Johnson 1 time dose.  She states later that day after receiving the vaccination she had a significant headache that developed.  She states that since then she has had a dry nonproductive cough with intermittent shortness of breath and morning nausea and vomiting that last till about 1:00 p.m..  She states that the headaches have resolved at this time but the cough, intermittent shortness of breath and nausea and vomiting have persisted.  She denies any abdominal pain, chest pain, chest pressure or chest tightness.  She states that she has not been experiencing any dizziness, vision changes or lightheadedness.  She was seen in the urgent care about a week ago and was prescribed Zofran to assist with the nausea.  She states that she was taking it twice in the morning and has now been able to only take it once, does feel that the nausea is improving but was out of the medication today, states that she was not able to take anything today and did have an episode of nonbloody nonbilious vomiting.  She states that she was having some constipation she feels that this was related to the over-the-counter pain medications that she was taking for the headaches.  She states that she was advised to take MiraLax at her last urgent care visit which she has been taking, had a normal bowel movement yesterday.  She states that she has had pneumonia in the past, no history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  With the continued symptoms came to the urgent care for evaluation.  She states that there have been to other coworkers who have had exposure or have now tested positive for COVID-19.  Medical Decision Making:  59-year-old well-appearing female who presents to the urgent care with cough and nausea and vomiting over the past 2 weeks.  Reviewed patient&#39;s previous urgent care notes as well as immunization record.  Her vital signs are stable in the urgent care today and exam is largely benign.  Given her history and current complaints did obtain a chest x-ray which appears negative, formal interpretation was pending at time of discharge.  She was provided Zofran in the urgent care today which she did state helps with the nausea.  Discussed with patient that I do feel that COVID-19 testing should be collected as at the time of her symptoms and given her continued symptoms she has not had full immunity from the vaccination and this could still be a COVID-19 infection.  She is in agreeance and COVID testing is pending.  Prescribed refill of her Zofran as well as Tessalon for cough relief and advised continued symptomatic measures and close follow-up with PCP for any persistent symptoms.  She was provided a work note given her symptoms and COVID-19 testing she was provided the standard COVID-19 work letter.  Patient educated on warning signs and symptoms that would prompt immediate reevaluation. They conveyed understanding and were agreeable to this plan of care. All questions addressed at this time. Pt was non toxic appearing and not in any acute distress upon discharge.

                                                Returned home around 4:30 PM from vaccine and felt a bit tired &amp; not hungry for dinner. Iced my arm and took 2 Tylenol as my head began hurting.  I went to bed at 9:00 PM and woke up around 1:00 AM with an excruciating headache and felt nauseous I took 2 more Tylenol, but could not fall back asleep. I felt very nauseous and was unable to go back to sleep. Oddly, I was sitting up wide awake and for a period of about 30 minutes, I began seeing brightly colored images that looked like they were floating in front of me. It was extremely odd as my eyes were open and I was awake. I finally fell back asleep around 5:30 AM and had horrifying vivid nightmares. When I woke up around 8:00 AM my headache was still there and I felt somewhat nauseous but not as bad as during the night.  My headache continued through the day on Saturday and I continued to take Tylenol about every 6 hours. I attempted to go to bed around 9 PM when I experienced horrible chest pain that radiated through my chest and into the left side of my throat. This was frightening because the pain did not let up for 7 to 8 hours, even after taking a Tagamet. I&#39;ve never suffered from heartburn previously other than when I was 8 months pregnant with twins. I was lucky to have any medication at home and that was only because my husband suffered from heartburn frequently. I finally fell asleep around 6:00 am for just a few hours and woke up feeling tired, but no headache or chest pain. Other than feeling tired, the symptoms appeared to all be gone. On a positive note, my arm never became sore!

However around day 5 the fatigue came back along with a lot of gastro intestinal discomfort.  Again, I didn?t think much of it, until last week I started putting the pieces together and decided by today this was worth reporting.  I have been extremely tired,  diarrhea 2-5 times per day, headaches, and nausea persistently. Since day  5 post vaccine.

Fever the entire night until the following day. Went to urgent care for COVID tests to be sure. Fever and headaches April 3 and 4, April 5 started to have diarrhea still with really painful headache. COVID tests came out negative April 6th. Took another COVID test the same date to be sure. Went to Urgent care again April 7th because of headaches and swollen nodes. Nurse Practitioner said severe allergy to pollen. Tests came out negative again April 8th, felt better, headaches diminished. As of today, April 13th, every time I eat, I have to go.  My stomach cannot digest my food, liquid and solid.

                                                Patient stated she felt the vaccine go into her arm and she continues to have pain in her neck and arm 4 days later. She also mentioned pain in her feet after having them elevated for a period of time. She has also complained of having diarrhea since getting her shot.

                                                I had bloody diarrhea 6 out of the first 7 days after being vaccinated. Low grade fever the first morning only but stomach pain and discomfort for 9 days and felt faint when in a store on day 8. I have never had bloody diarrhea for more than 1 day ever. I do have a lot of medical conditions that require me to take a lot of medication and this may have contributed to it.

I don?t typically have stomach pains but at the time I didn?t contract it to the shot. It eventually went away and came back one other time about a week later. It also went away.

The headache progressed throughout the day and was accompanied by nausea to the point where I was not able to eat anything.  At times I did feel cold but there was no fever.  It felt like a bad sinus headache and continued throughout the evening. I did take Advil and sinus medication for relief. I was fine the next day when I awoke.

                                                At 23 hours post Johnson and Johnson vaccination, I began to have a 10/10 headache (which was the worst headache of my life), nausea and severe aura. I then became extremely confused and was taken to the emergency department by my husband. The following was reported to me the next day when I awoke in the ICU at Hospital: within an hour of arriving at the ED, I exhibited a progressive hyperactive delirium, agitation, slurred speech (word salad), combativeness, confabulation, word finding difficulties and an inability to follow commands. The neurologist in the ED said that she was seeing this adverse vaccination side effect in other patients at the 24-hour period. I received Haldol, Zyprexa, and Ativan to control the delirium and received a head CT angiogram in the ED, which was normal. I was transferred by ambulance to the main hospital due to acute metabolic encephalopathy/altered mental status. I was admitted to the neurological unit whereby I became critically hypotensive (60s over 30s) and was transferred to the ICU due to persistent hypotension unresponsive to IV normal saline. I was then transferred and admitted to the ICU and was given continued IV fluid resuscitation and Levophed vasopressor. I was eventually weaned from vasopressors and was discharged back home in three days exhausted, bruised, fatigued and with continuous clouded mentation. I have been told by all of the doctors that this was a vaccination side-effect, which caused cerebritis. I was subsequently treated as an outpatient at Hospital for intractable aura with IV Valporic Acid, Magnesium, and Lasix infusion on April 1, 2021.

                                                Immediately that evening, I started to get headachy and nauseous. My arm in the injection site was very sore. The next morning, the other arm was sore. It was difficult for me to raise my arms above my head without feeling extremely weak. I couldn&#39;t lift anything above my head for the fear I would drop them. Knee replacement surgery on both knees about 4 years ago - I felt pain in my knees; all my joints; all of my teeth; my vision was blurry. My head hurt so badly. Tylenol dulled the headache and joint pain but it didn&#39;t help it to go away. My chest also hurt quite a bit. I felt extremely lethargic.  I didn&#39;t feel like getting out of bed. I could only get the  meals  made (I&#39;m a caregiver for my mom and mother-in-law) and then get back into bed. I usually walk five miles a day. I&#39;m still not there yet ( to walk that much) but I&#39;m getting better. The nausea lasted until the 17th. The headache just left finally on April 23. The body aches, teeth ache and joints subsided around the 17th also. The blurry vision - I still have a a little bit of that but it&#39;s starting to improve. The weakness in the arm - that is starting to improve - I do still feel kind of weak when I raise my arms above my head. The fatigue I still have but I&#39;m feeling a bit of improvement.  I have to keep checking my bed to see if I accidentally put the massage setting on (and I hadn&#39;t) because my body was shaking  in entire  body- That started on the second day after the vaccine and stopped about the 19th. I called to the advice nurse to register my health complaint and she had me come in for a full workup. And she asked me to go to ER. They kept me in the ER overnight.

                                                The day of the vaccine, in the evening, I got severe stomach cramps and then I got diarrhea really bad. The cramps went on all night into the next day. They were so painful - like labor pain. The next day, I had a GI hemorrhage - it was clots of blood coming out of the digestive system. I contacted my regular practitioner doctor and sent him a picture of the clots and he instructed me to go to ER. I ended up going to Urgent Care. I went to the Urgent Care on Saturday or Sunday. The Urgent Care doctor there thought I had food poisoning. But that day I didn&#39;t eat anything - I just had had ginger ale, cranberries and cashews. He was puzzled as to why I had these symptoms. He gave me medication to stop the cramping in my stomach.  Medication is: Hyoscyamine. I used it even two weeks after the fact because I would occasionally get real bad stomach cramps. I was also referred to get a colonoscopy - haven&#39;t been able to get in yet. The GI hemorrhaging lasted two or three days and then disappeared.

I was diagnosed with severe sepsis and colitis.  Although I was diagnosed with sepsis, I never had a fever and all blood cultures came back negative.  Before I was released, I went into uncontrolled atrial fibrillation.  I never had any history of colitis or atrial fibrillation prior to this.  No one can explain why there was no fever or pathogen detected.

I then started to feel sweaty and my hands were ice cold at the same time as feeling sweaty. The pharmacist called 911.  I was taken by ambulance to the hospital.  An IV was started in the ambulance, and I was given oxygen because I started to feel nausueous. At the hospital I was given an IV, and something for nausea then sent home.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included pre-diabetic. It was unknown if patient was taking any prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, or herbal remedies at the time of vaccination. No allergies to medications, food, or other products was reported. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not have an adverse event following any previous vaccine.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805020, and batch number: 1805020 expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 20-MAR-2021 (also reported as 27-MAR-2021) for prophylactic vaccination. Anatomical vaccination site were not reported. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 03-APR-2021, one week after vaccination, the patient had headache and vomiting.  On 05-APR-2021, the patient had seizure due to hemorrhagic stroke. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced brain compression, brain stem haemorrhage, brain stem syndrome, cerebral haemorrhage, hemiplegia, possible cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, biopsy soft tissue, and brain scan abnormal, and was hospitalized.  On 06-APR-2021, the patient had a surgery to remove pressure on brain and brain stem (craniectomy). The surgeon noted alarmingly low platelet counts (results unspecified). The patient had platelet transfusion. The patient was hospitalized for &#39;4 days&#39;. The patient continued to bleed on 06-APR-2021 and 07-APR-2021. The patient was removed from life support on 08-APR-2021. The patient died on 08-APR-2021. It was unknown if autopsy was performed. Laboratory data reported following: Brain scan was abnormal  and showed abnormal, multi-focal brain bleeds and increased compression of brain. On 07-APR-2021, Brain scan abnormal which showed increased bleeding and brain stem injury. On 08-APR-2021, the patient died from possible cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Laboratory data (dates unspecified) included: Biopsy soft tissue (NR: not provided) unknown, Pathology test (NR: not provided) unknown. On 08-APR-2021, the subject died from possible cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. It was unknown if an autopsy was performed. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient died of possible cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, brain compression, brain stem haemorrhage, brain stem syndrome, cerebral haemorrhage, hemiplegia, seizure, haemorrhagic stroke and continued to bleed on 08-APR-2021, had not recovered from headache, vomiting, and platelet count decreased, and the outcome of biopsy soft tissue and brain scan abnormal was not reported. This report was serious (Death, and Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged). This case, involving the same patient is linked to 20210441454.  Additional information was received on 24-MAY-2021. Following information was added and incorporated into the narrative. Additional events of haemorrhagic stroke and continued to bleed were added, seriousness of events platelet count, vomiting, and headache was updated, additional reference numbers were added, additional vaccination date added in narrative, labeling updated, and course of event and laboratory data updated. It was determined that Manufacturer Case Number 20210441454 was a duplicate of this case. All relevant information regarding this case will be submitted under Manufacturer Case Number 20210500861. Upon review, the following information was amended: events biopsy soft tissue and brain scan abnormal was updated from non-serious to serious as this was on the earlier VAERS report.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V2: Additional information received regarding updates in seriousness of events, labeling, course of events, case identifier; and additional evets of hemorrhagic stroke and &#34;continued to  bleed&#34; did not alter prior assessment.    This fatal spontaneous report (VAERS ID 1244328) concerned a 59- year- old female who experienced vomiting, headache and seizures and was hospitalized for brain compression, brain stem hemorrhage, brain stem syndrome, cerebral hemorrhage, hemorrhagic stroke, hemiplegia, possible cerebral venous sinus thrombosis 16 days after Janssen COVID-19 vaccine was administered for prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient was pre-diabetic with no known allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. Biopsy soft tissue was done (results not reported) and brain scan showed multi-focal brain bleeds and increased compression of brain; the patient underwent neurosurgery.  The platelet count  was decreased (result not reported) and received platelet transfusion. Follow-up scan next day showed increased/continued bleeding and brain stem injury and a day later she died from possible cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. It was unknown if an autopsy was performed. Although the  subject&#39;s pre-diabetic status may have contributed, based on evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS, per definition from Brighton Collaboration - BC) and considering the low platelet count and temporal relationship to vaccination (BC Criteria level 5), the events are assessed to have a plausible relationship with vaccination.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: POSSIBLE CEREBRAL VENOUS SINUS THROMBOSIS

I also noticed my lymph nodes were all swollen and sore, the ones in my neck were the worst, I had a severe headache, I was extremely fatigued and body aches. The body aches were excruciating. I was bed ridden for 3 days . I also had nausea and completely lost my appetite. I remember being very thirsty. I had really sever fatigue, it took a week before I started feeling better. I had to take a week off of work. I&#39;m having a really hard time with fatigue now. It seemed to cause what I would call is a huge flair up of my fibromyalgia .

                                                I came home from work on the 14th and I was freezing cold. I laid on my bed and bundled up in 5 0r 6 blankets even though it was 110 degrees outside. I got up and took a couple of Tylenol and went to sleep. Got up the next day and went to work and worked through my day and took my grandchildren somewhere and I got home and I was freezing and miserable. I took a couple Tylenol. On Wednesday, my husband said &#34;This isn&#39;t normal&#34; and he took me  to Urgent Care - and they tested for COVID it came back positive for COVID. Gave me a cough medicine prescription - but it was starting to upset my stomach. Had my husband to give me bananas and applesauce and when I eat that then I take the medication so it won&#39;t upset my stomach. And I can&#39;t breathe, I cough and have fevers and pain. I am pretty sure right now I have blood clots in my legs. I get up every once in a while to get something to eat and I&#39;m really light headed and dizzy. Have to hold on to walls - don&#39;t feel stable in walking. And then I lay down in bed again.  I did get my doctor to call in a large dose of Zofran. I&#39;ve got Zofran now and two different cough medicines.  Other than the cough medicine (which makes me dizzy when I call back) - it does prevent me from coughing.  Symptoms ongoing. I&#39;ve tried to  force myself to get up more today and move around more to do a few things. I have had to take my work in small portions to fold three or four pieces of clothing and then rest a while. I don&#39;t have the energy to hardly do anything. I&#39;m nervous to going back to work. I&#39;m in the process of  recovery.

Gave me Levofloxacin and it seemed to clear it up.  June  24 I got a high fever of 101.5.  Went to Immediate Care and another UTI.  Due to the fact I started itching at the end of the last treatment, decided to try Myobic.  Had a fever for 4 more days and it finally it cleared up.

                                                I had itchy, scratchy throat on the 12th in afternoon. Sunday, I woke up fully congested. I went to the pharmacy to get decongestant and I ended up going into the clinic, 13th, to get checked. There, they looked in my nose and she said it was stuffy and goopy. She wasn&#39;t convinced it was an infection so told me to wait until. On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, I worked all day and was exhausted when I went home and on Wed, 16th, I started taking the antibiotic, I just felt bad and felt really stuffy. Got a low-grade fever, was taking Tylenol. I felt went really bad and I went as a walk-in to my primary care doctor. She said to let whatever it was to take its course. I had a little bout of nausea that would come here and there (she said that was from the drip in the back of my throat). Thursday night, I got dehydrated because I wasn&#39;t drinking enough or eating enough, nothing sounded good, though. I had a really bad headache and I passed out, woke up very quickly though. I woke up and felt nauseated. Husband took me to ER. They did an EKG and other testing including COVID test, positive result. Zinc; vitamin D, I started taking it every day instead of three days a week and added vitamin C and the elderberry gummies with immune support. I drank 7-8 bottles of water with electrolytes in it a day. I was in bed for three days without getting up. I got a pulse oximeter (as instructed by nurse at ER), never got below 90. The virus never went into my chest of my lungs and I never had to use my inhaler one time. I have about 90% of taste back now; I have some of my smell back. I didn&#39;t go back to work until 29th of June and I was just working short days as I was still very, very tired. About 3PM the tiredness would hit. Into this week, I&#39;m not as tired anymore. I don&#39;t have 100% of energy back for exercising back.

I went to the eye doctor that said I have fast growing cataracts, The doctor did say this is not an age related cataracts this is a fast growing cataracts.  I also hade muscle and body aches and headaches and fever, and I had horrible horrible fatigue to the point I had to take naps through out the day. I also had diarrhea for 3 days. And my arm where I got the shot was sore for almost 4 days.
