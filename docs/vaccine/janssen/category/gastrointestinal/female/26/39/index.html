These lasted for about 2 hours before decreasing in severity but continued to be present until about 10:30pm, 13 and a half hours after receiving the shot. Nothing was done to treat the symptoms. As of 12:30pm on 3/10, some minor symptoms are still present, such as muscle weakness and pain, severe migraine, and dizziness.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Six hours after I received the vaccine I began to feel full body muscle aches and shivers. I took 2 Advil. I went to bed at 9:30 p.m. and woke up at 11:30 p.m. feeling as though I had slept 8 hours because I had a 102 fever. My face was burning from the heat and I was shaking. I took two more Advil. About 30 minutes later I threw up. I waited 30 more minutes and threw up again. As a result, of having Addison&#39;s disease, I have an emergency steroid injection that I use during crises such as this. I took my shot and immediately began feeling slightly better. I was able to go back to bed and at some point the fever went down overnight. I am currently feeling weak and with no fever. I also have a slight headache.

                                                Hi, I received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine one week ago, Thurs March 11. On friday, I experienced the typical flu like symptoms - chills aches pains and fever. These have slowly gone away, but a week later I still have chills and constantly shake, and diarrhea. The most significant side effect I want to report is extreme vertigo and dizziness and headaches. These have been present for a week now and have prevented me from working and doing daily activities. I constantly feel like Im going to fall over and cannot see clearly. I previously had vestibular migraines, but these have been mostly gone due to going to the chiropractor and taking my supplements. The vaccine brought them back now in full force. I read that this is becoming a commonality among other people and need answers on this. I want to make sure its not permanent or that I will have this as a serious side effect.

She returned to the post-vaccine administration monitoring area after about two minutes to sit down again.  At that time, I asked more questions about symptoms.  She was also feeling weak and like she may pass out.  I gave her a cold compress to place on her neck which improved her symptoms very rapidly.  She remained in the area with the cold compress for about 10 more minutes before she felt well and she then left with her husband.

Patient did not hit the ground or injure herself-she did not lose consciousness she was flushed and sweating.  Pharmacist sat on floor with patient for 2-3 minutes and gave her water, patient was then able to stand up with little assistance and brought to sit down.  Patient stated she felt nauseous and may vomit she was given a trash can but did not vomit she was able to drink a bottle of water and was given a soft pretzel.  After about 10 minutes she stated she was feeling much better was no longer flushed or sweating she called her boyfriend for a  ride home.

                                                12 hours after vaccine around 3:30am on Saturday I woke up with sever chills, shaking uncontrollably for an hour or 2. I fell back to sleep and woke up about an hour later burning up and sore head to toe. I threw up and had a migraine that lasted the rest of the day. I was able to fall asleep around 6:30am and when I woke up around 9 I was just exhausted, sore all over, nauseous, with a headache. This lasted about a day. On sunday afternoon my toddler lightly hit my right arm where the vaccine was and it became sore, red, and swollen. By the late evening that day the soreness and redness increased. Monday-Thursday the redness and swelling increased to about 2 inches round and felt very tight with a lump in the swelling and it was warm to the touch. By friday the redness and swelling reduced to about an inch, but there is still an inch small lump at the injection site and hurts when anything touches it. The redness has faded and there is no visual bruising.

I came out of it within 10 minutes. 16 hours later I had a 102 fever. Took Tylenol Felt fine 24 hours later 32 hours later I started to get a headache and light sensitivity. Fever back to over 99- low grade for me.  35 hours later I had such a bad headache and light sensitivity. I couldn?t watch tv, be on my phone, or look at a computer screen. I also started to get bouts of nausea. 38 hours later, I vomited for the first time. Same symptoms as what I described last. 42 hours later, I vomited again. 48 hours later - 5 days later, light sensitivity and  migraine symptoms continued , but improved slowly each day.               6 days later, all previous symptoms were gone. I woke up with a bump in my inner eye. Slowly went away throughout the day, then developed a itchy, red bump in between my lips and nose, that progressively got bigger throughout the day and made my lip swell. Bump was about 2 inches in diameter at its biggest. Took Claritin, cleaned face with alcohol, and by 24 hours later it was not noticeable.  8 days later, the bump appeared again in between lip and nose on the opposite side of my face.  Took Benadryl, bump slowly went down throughout the day. By 24 hours later it was gone

I then began to feel nauseous again and get extreme chills. I vomited multiple times, and was curled up in a fetal position crying from the nausea, headache, and a feeling of pressure in my chest. I ended up going to bed to sleep it off, waking up in a pool of sweat. I felt better the next day.

                                                Around 11 PM on April 8th after receiving the Janssen vaccine around 4:50, I woke up with intense chills, nausea and a fever.  I also experienced an intense stomach pain that came and went that would make it difficult to move without severe pain. I felt extremely disoriented and confused and had a strong headache throughout the intense period of symptoms. Around 7 AM on April 9th the next day, the symptom&#39;s severity decreased and I experienced all of the symptoms mildly along with drowsiness. On april 10th I did not experience any stomach pain, body aches, or chills but, still experienced drowsiness, intermittent headaches and a mild fever. On april 11th, drowsiness  and a headache continued. Today, april 12th, I am still experiencing a mild headache and slight drowsiness.

                                                Within 2 hours of getting the vaccine, I developed a severe migraine, fever(100.1-100.4), chills, dizziness, extreme body aches, nausea and was very weak. Once the bulk of the symptoms subsided, a little under 48 hours after the vaccine was administered, I was able to resume to my daily life. I still have a lingering migraine, arm pain, body aches and a low grade fever of 99.9 now almost 72 hours later, but it is bearable unlike the immediate 48 hours following the vaccine. Over-the-counter medications usually take the edge off of my migraines, though they didn?t even come close to helping the one I currently have. I have been rotating Tylenol and ibuprofen since developing the side effects.

I had taken both Adderall and Allegra that day. 4 days after receiving the vaccine, I took Adderall and Allegra and had an adverse reaction (I hadn&#39;t taken Adderall the prior 3 days). I experienced palpitations and vertigo/dizziness plus slight nausea. The next day, I took a much lower dose of Adderall and decided to continue taking approximately 1/3rd of my typical dose after an E-visit with my primary care Dr. During the week of 4/5, I was able to increase the dose by a little bit without any adverse reactions. Starting on 4/11, I was able to take 2/3rds of the typical dose without adverse reaction. However, I am still experiencing vertigo/dizziness, which may or may not be sinus-related due to seasonal allergies.

Besides the body aches and diarrhea on 4/3 and 4/4, On 4/6 I had the worst migraine ever where I lost 1/3 of my vision for about an hour and my right side of my body went numb for about 15 mins. I&#39;ve been having migraines more frequently than I ever have and unsure if it is vaccine related or just extra stress. I have been trying to reduce screen time as much as I can but hard when I work full-time and in grad school and use the computer all the time. I also have been taking motrin/tylenol for the pain and lay down to let the pain pass.

I was extremely tired and the aches had significantly increased so I went to bed at about 8:00pm. When I couldn?t sleep around 9:30pm I took 1000 mg of acetaminophen. I woke up at around 11:00pm and felt extremely feverish (shivering, entire body extremely soar. My joints hurt so badly that I couldn?t get comfortable) and nauseous. I then had 4 or 5 episodes of violent vomiting throughout the night every 2 or so hours.  After, I would be drenched in sweat.  When I got up *crawled to trash can next to my bed* at around 2:30/3:00AM I took 200mg ibprofin. Felt fatigued and no appetite the next day then was fine

                                                Had typical post vaccine symptoms right after - nausea, muscle aches, chills, fatigue. 5 days after vaccine those appeared to have dissipated. Went for a light walk in the morning. Completely lost vision in both eyes extremely blurry. Stumbled my way home running into trees, cars. Vision came back, thought it was migraine (had them before but nowhere NEAR as bad, never had vision completely blocked)  Excurtating headache behind eyes and nausea, feels like pressure in head. Worst headache of my life, went to ER. Gave morphine (did not help pain at all which was horrifying) got a head CT scan which came out clear and discharged because clotting ruled out. It is now day 6 and my headache is persistent and still excruciatingly painful. I?m also extremely nauseous. I?m terrified because I know something is very wrong. ER doc said might be lingering side effect from vaccine but those effects felt very different.

                                                Sudden onset back pain on 04/09/2021, localized to the center of my spine, so bad i thought i was going to vomit. Tylenol was unhelpful but I had also taken my anxiety medication and 25mg of Benedryl, so the fact that it lasted roughly 4 hours is an estimation because i did eventually fall asleep.   Chest pain on 04/10/2021, ongoing but only sometimes excruciatingly painful. Had costochondritis about a year ago, it eventually went away. This pain is the same as that. I was told that people who get costochondritis are likely to get it again, so may be unrelated to the vaccine, but thought i would list it anyways.   General unwell feeling lasted until 04/13/2021  Unrelenting nausea lasted until 04/13/2021  Diarrhea started today 04/14/2021

I felt better for a few days and five or six days after the shot I started to get headaches again. The headaches got progressively worse and more frequent. I don&#39;t normally get headaches. It was pain at the lower back side of my head which was dull but got worse and throbbing in periods. My pain level was an eight or nine. They lasted most of the day. I am still getting a few headaches after three weeks. I have been taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen and it is starting to get better. It is still every day and the mornings are worse before I take a pain reliever. My pain level with the headaches is more like a 3-5 range level of pain.

                                                The first 2 days had awful headache and muscle aches, could not leave the bed. Then a week later, I got a horrible rash all of my body, worse at my hands and feet. The rash included many blisters. Loss of appetite and cannot sleep. I still have the rash now, and it is even getting worse in some parts, while other parts are better due to a steroid cream prescribed by my dermatologist.  On April 26, I felt very dizzy and weak and went to urgent care. I have since recovered from those symptoms.

The pharmacist/doctors at CVS gave me some water and told me to elevate ny legs. After 10 minutes they checked my termperature and blood pressure. I stabized somewhat and when home. I was sure it it was my nerves but something did feel right. I had a slight burning in my chest and felt queezy on/off throughout the day. Chills and hot flashes followed. I was anxious and paranoid about the possibility something serious coukd be wrong with me. I felt shooting pains in my lower left abdomen that nught and the next day. The following day I still felt very weak. My arm hurt. My muscles felt like jello and I?m unhappy. I wish I never got the shot and I?m worried about my body?s reaction to it.

I got out of bed and fainted on the floor. Laid there for a few moments. Got water. Laid back into bed and my body completely locked up. It felt like there were pins and needles coursing through my entire body. I couldn?t bend or move my legs. My wrists were bent down and my fingers all locked together. I could not move them at all. I was screaming out in pain. It was the worst pain I?ve ever felt. My roommate called 911. Paramedics arrived and took my temperature and blood pressure. They tried calming me down. eventually I did. And my fingers and legs unlocked but I continued having a severe headache, back pain, muscle aches and nausea. I woke up every hour of the night and threw up several times.  It?s been 24 hours after the shot and I am still having headaches fatigue and muscle spasms.

I had to go home from work due to these feelings. Eventually, developed into a fever. I went home and the chills and aches worsened. I could not get warm not matter how many layers or blankets I had. I took tylenol and fell asleep after several hours. When I woke up, I was profusely sweaty, my fever  broke. I was able to eat a small lunch and continued to lie down the whole day. My symptoms lessened and were more minimal 24 hours after. After going to sleep the second night, I felt back to normal upon wake up.

                                                Injection technique seemed poor as it was the most painful vaccination I&#39;ve ever received, and upper arm became tight and achy immediately. Soreness lingered but the sharper pain went away shortly after. About 8-10 hours later I began feeling nauseous and lightheaded. 12 hours after vaccine I had trouble falling asleep, overcome with nausea and chills.  This turns into sweating and insomnia the rest of the night. The following day I felt better, but the next night (and following one) I continued feeling a bit sick. Currently (3 days later) my upper arm is still very sore and I have lots of muscle/joint aches throughout my whole body.

                                                Vaccination appointment was at 1:30 pm on Monday, April 5. I received the shot at around 2:00pm in my left arm. It hurt going in, but quickly dissipated as I moved my arm. I felt fine for the rest of the day. I felt normal the following morning (April 6), but started to feel tired in the early afternoon. I took a nap around 3:00-4:30pm, and woke up feeling slightly hungry. I went to bed around 11:00pm. I woke up the next day (April 7) with a headache. I called in sick to work and stayed in bed as my headache grew worse and nausea began to appear. I threw up for the first time at 11:00am, then again around 11:30am. I emptied my bowels in between these bouts of vomiting, and my stomach was very obviously empty after the second bout. I took a nap from 12:00-2:00pm, after which I threw up at 2:30pm and then again at 3:00pm and again at 3:30pm. I took another nap from 4:00-5:00pm, then threw up again around 5:30pm. I threw up a seventh time around 6:00pm and saw  a couple flecks of blood in my vomit. Each bout was sudden in onset and violent but quick. I think I burst some of the blood vessels in my throat, because it was sore. I called a friend to take me to the ER, and threw up once or twice more while waiting. On the way to the ER, I threw up for the last time. The ER gave me Toradol, Zofran, and two bags of IV fluids. This improved all my symptoms. The next morning, April 8, I felt much better until 12:00pm, when I laid down for a nap and couldn&#39;t get out of bed until 4:30. My headache had returned so I took Advil, then ate some rice. I felt better from 6:00pm onwards.

At around 4pm, a mild headache started, and I was experiencing cramping from my chest down to my stomach. I had no appetite that evening. By 8pm, I had a 101.0 fever, and by 9:30pm the cramps were severe in my lower stomach. I was sweating profusely and shaking until I vomited, which helped to relieve some of the stomach pain. Before I vomited, I was in intense pain- possibly some of the worst pain that I have experienced in my life. The sweats and chills alternated throughout the night, and the headache was intense. The next day, the chills, sweats and headache persisted until mid-afternoon, in addition to the occasional stomach pain and diarrhea. The side effects slowly subsided, and I was feeling better by 4/9. The sweating was the longest lasting side effect.

Around approximately 8pm I was feeling very feverish, experiencing body aches, mental fog, intense shaking and chills,  and within the next few hours threw up multiple times. I eventually fell asleep and sweated profusely, waking up multiple times (unusual for me). The next day I had low appetite, fatigue, and body aches, but other symptoms were reduced.

                                                In the evening while making dinner I noticed mild pain at injection site and began to notice increasing chills, and unusually intense tiredness, which were followed that night by a low grade fever, headache, and nausea which led to vomiting.  Was unable to sleep that night and unable to eat most of the following day due to these symptoms, primarily the nausea. Symptoms began to resolve during the later afternoon of April 11th. No medical treatment sought as these were side effects listed on the fact sheet and expected to go away which they did. Still experiencing mild arm pain in injection arm but expecting that to resolve soon on its own.

                                                I got the J&amp;J vaccine around 2:30pm on a Saturday and by 6 or 7pm I was experiencing a really bad headache. This headache extended down my back and around the back and top of my skull. By 8pm I had began experiencing chills, body aches, and nausea. By 9pm I had a fever and could not stand up without feeling like I was going to vomit. Walking to even get water in the other room gave me motion sickness. I was shaking and sweating with a fever all night, was unable to sleep, and experienced hallucinations due to the high fever. The next morning I still had a fever but could finally sleep. I still had a bad headache, body aches, and nausea. I slept most of the day and my fever went down but was still &gt;100 degrees all day. On Monday, I had a mild fever in the morning which went away by afternoon. I  felt weak all day Monday and still experienced body aches and a headache. By Tuesday, I was only experiencing fatigue and brain fog. This lasted about a week.

                                                After feeling better from the expected symptoms of the vaccine I experienced intermittent nausea and a few instances of dizziness. These events would happen about 3 times per day lasting from an hour to two hours for about 3 weeks after my vaccine. The bouts were the worst the first 2 weeks after vaccination and have finally now begun to subside about 5 weeks after. I have never experienced nausea without any other symptoms before in my life. I honestly thought I could be pregnant but I have had 2 periods since vaccination so it definitely was not that.

Around 1:00am (4/11/21), my fever and chills escalated, my body was shaking until I wrapped up in several blankets.   At 2:30am, I woke up with nausea. At 3:00am, I vomited. I continued to have fever and chills and body aches.   At 9:30am, I had body aches and felt only slightly feverish. I took acetaminophen for the rest of the day and had no problems.

After a week of the vaccination, I started experiencing menstrual symptoms...extreme bloating, very swollen breasts,  and stomach cramps, but I have not gotten my cycle. I am now 3 weeks late and have had very consistent periods prior to my vaccination. I took three negative at-home pregnancy tests.

As of 4/15 hard lump remains at injection site. 4/6- 12:15pm hives, redness, itching, burning on sides of upper thighs, buttocks, within 2 hours hives spread to backs of arms, all the way down legs. Went to quick care facility at 2:30pm. Waited in waiting room until 3:50pm checked legs with doctor at 4:00pm and little red dots appeared in random clusters down both legs. Doctor assumed folliculitis, prescribed Cephalexin. 5:00pm took 50mg Benadryl while waiting for prescription. Picked up antibiotic around 6:30pm. When I got home around 7:00pm both legs were burning. Discovered huge painful red patches all over both legs. 10:00pm took 50mg Benadryl again. Went to bed 4/7- 9:00am red patches still painful, burning. Took 50mg more Benadryl. Spent most of the day sleeping 4/8- hives gone due to benadryl. Red patches slightly less painful. New red patches/dots appeared on ankles and tops of feet 4/9- red dots spread over tops of feet/toes, new itchy bumps with red dots appeared trailing down the backs of calf area on both legs. 8:30am went back to quick care facility. Saw new doctor who instructed to stop taking antibiotic and switch to cream form of &#34;triamcinolone 0.1%&#34; twice daily. Also referred to dermatology specialist. 3:30pm first application of steroid cream made legs burn and feet/ankles swell. Determined too much was used 4/10-4/13 smaller amount of cream applied twice daily as directed. Burning stopped but feet/ankles still swollen each day 4/13-original large red patches mostly cleared. New red dots on backs of calves and tops of feet still prevalent. 4:00pm saw dermatology specialist who determined red dots were a form of vasculitis. Ordered blood and urine analysis to determine if other organs have been affected. Scheduled appointment with laboratory for 4/17 at 11:00am Other symptoms: dizziness, abdominal pain/pressure, diarrhea at various points throughout the day from 4/9-current

                                                Friday evening I had what I thought was normal reaction: chills, aches, headache, nausea. Saturday it was mostly aches. Sunday was dizziness, aches, nausea and cramping in left leg. Monday was nausea, aches, tingling in hands and feet, headache, brain fog. Tuesday I woke up with major imbalance and needed to use walls to walk without falling over. Dizziness subsided after some time to only rapid movements. I had a warm burning sensation in left leg with tingling hands and feet. Moderate headache. Reports came out of stopping the Janssen vaccine so I contacted my doctor with my symptoms and they ordered blood tests for clots.

By the 12 hour mark I had a 103.9 fever, chills, severe body aches, nausea, weakness, fatigue, and dizziness. Treated with Tylenol and Advil over the next 24 hours. Fever, aches and chills subsided within 48 hours. Weakness and fatigue lasted for 7 days after vaccination, then went away. General dizziness (constantly feels like when you have a cold/ear infection and get up and are dizzy) persists through date of this report (day 12 after vaccination). I feel completely better except for the dizziness.

                                                On 03/18/2021 at 03:30AM I had a lot of arm pain from my shoulder to my elbow in my left arm. This lasted until 03/31/2021.  On 03/18/2021 I woke up with a headache that would not go away. Next, at about 03:15PM I was not able to walk for about 10 minutes. Then, at about 05:00PM I started menstruating. At 07:00PM I had severe pain in my pelvic area for an hour and a half. At approximately 08:30PM I passed a softball sized blood clot vaginally.  I bled heavily through the night.  On 03/19/2021 I still had a headache and no energy at all. I continued to bleed heavily all day as well. 03/20/2021 was the exact same as the days prior. 03/21/2021 I was still bleeding heavily throughout the day with no energy. I still had the headache as well. I started feeling dizzy while walking on this day.  03/22/2021 I went to work like normal. I was cold all day. I was still bleeding, headache and dizziness. It was hard to stand for 30 minutes. While climbing the stairs I got very light headed and dizzy. I could not go up the stairs at a normal pace. 03/23/2021 I had the same symptoms all day but I was getting short of breath walking short distances. I still had very little energy and a headache. I also lost all color in my face and hands. I was still cold all day. I noticed some slight swelling in my ankles.  03/24/2021 The symptoms were getting more intense. I was still cold.  I finally took some aspirin for the headache because it was very severe. The medication didn&#39;t help with it. This routine went on for the next week and the symptoms intensified with each day. Throughout this time I was still passing clots that ranged in size from golf/ping pong ball to baseballs. They were very painful when they passed.  The days from 03/25/2021 to 04/01/2021 were all the same as far as how I felt.  On 04/02/2021 I woke up with the same symptoms but now I could not stay awake for anything. I slept on and off all day. I only ate one meal a day because I was so tired and I had no appetite. The headache was getting worse as the days went on. The bleeding was still happening. It was not as heavy as the weeks before, but enough to be painful still. I also started having abdominal pain.  On 04/03/2021 I was seeing stars when I moved too quickly. My heart rate was elevated with shortness of breath along with the rest of the previous symptoms. My headache however was very intense.  04/04/2021 I still couldn&#39;t stay awake on top of all the other symptoms. The dizziness and stars were more frequent. I couldn&#39;t move my head without seeing stars.  04/05/2021 I couldn&#39;t get warm and I still felt the same way. I called and made a doctor?s appointment for Wednesday the 7th. I had all the same symptoms still and they were getting worse. I had to move in slow motion so I could try to function.  04/06/2021 I woke up drained of all my energy and color. I couldn&#39;t shower because of the pain in my body. I couldn&#39;t stand because I felt like I was going to fall down. I could barely stand up straight let alone walk very far. I was shaking from being so cold. I had all the same symptoms from the days prior. I was in severe pain. I couldn&#39;t sit because of the pain in my abdomen I couldn&#39;t stand because of the weakness in my legs. I could barely see anything because of the stars I was seeing. At this point I had no color and I was barely conscious. That is when my family took me to the emergency room.

                                                After the shot I had a pasta lunch and then took a nap for about one hour.  When I woke up ( 3-4 hours after the shot) I had a fever.  I could tell because I was very hot and sweaty even though my room was air conditioned.  I drank water and immediately was nauseous and vomited.  I continued to have sweats, chills, and after about another hour body aches set in.  My whole body was cramping up and my hands were shaky.  I was very short of breath over short movements like to get to the bathroom, I would be out of breath and dizzy.   Around 1700  (6 hours post shot) I took Tylenol and continued to take it every six hours.  I was able to keep ginger ale and crackers down but didn&#39;t eat much else until the next morning.  I think the fever broke in the night.  The next morning I was just really tired and sore, but much less achy than the day prior.   I was able to eat light meals  and I stopped taking Tylenol sometime that mid-morning.  I felt fine the next day (about 48 hours after the shot).

I had bloody stool. On Saturday 4/24 I was still experiencing body and head pains and continued having bloody stool and by around midnight I had abdominal pains and went to the ER. My appetite was poor the prior week, and since this incident I have hardly been able to eat. I am constantly nauseous and dizzy. After days of not being able to eat, I ate some soup and vomited it back up. I still have abdominal pain, nausea, and am fatigued with a less intense headache.

I was handed water and told to sip on it, which proved difficult when my throat started to feel like it was swelling up. After about a 15 minute ordeal, it was like nothing ever happened. The only symptom that remained, was sweat soaked clothes

                                                Patient administered Janssen vaccine on 5/5/21 at 1011AM by pharmacist on duty. Patient did not admit any anxiety surrounding vaccine during counseling prior to receiving the vaccine. After administration patient mentioned she has can get anxious sometimes and has tendency to create symptoms in her head. She asked what to be on the look out for for signs of syncope and described starting to feel nauseous, clamy, and tunnel vision. Within seconds she briefly lost consciousness and started to slump in chair within immunization room. Pharmacist prevented her from falling out of chair while opening door to waiting room and asked for assistance from patients boyfriend. Together we held patient in place on chair and propped feet up on another chair. Immediately patient regained consciousness enough to explain what she was feeling but then quickly lost consciousness again and started snoring as if she immediately fell asleep. Boyfriend said no history of sleep issues/narcolepsy, together we laid patient on floor of immunization room with feet slightly elevated and boyfriend at her head and again she immediately regained consciousness. Patient explained that she was immediately starting to feel better and felt dizzy and described having very odd dream like scenarios. She laid on floor for 10 min, Alert and orientedx4, moved to seated position for another 10 min, accepted offer for apple juice, moved to waiting area to sit for another 10min before OK leaving. MOD/PDM aware....Called patient at 6pm that same evening and patient reported feeling great.

Further history obtained included decreased exercise tolerance since four weeks prior to presentation (noticeable during runs). She was found to have an abnormal EKG at an urgent care and was sent to an outside hospital emergency department. She ultimately was found to have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (56%), Stage C, Class III,  and myocarditis. The highest suspicion for the etiology of her myocarditis is viral vs. autoimmune (given response to steroids) vs. genetically-mediated myocarditis. She was discharged on aspirin, a prednisone taper, colchicine, metoprolol, and Entresto with cardiology follow-up. Patient discharged with 4 week monitor to monitor for arrhythmia as per EP service. Infiltrative cardiomyopathy evaluation pending as well- plan for SPEP/UPEP, serum/urine protein electrophoresis, immunofixation, and alpha-galactosidase (not sent due to specific tube not available).

I did notice my Raynaud?s symptoms became way worse.  At about 5:30pm I started to feel extremely cold. By 6pm I was having horrible pains and spasms in my lower back and hips. My muscles and joints became very stiff. This moved to my neck/shoulders, and down my thighs. I lost feeling in my feet and started struggling to be able to take in a full breath. I felt like my whole body was locked up. I started feeling nauseous, but part of that may have been from the nerves. The next morning I felt a bit more mobile but still nauseous and stiff. I have slowly gotten better throughout the day, but am still stiff and exhausted

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Received the shot at 11 am and started feeling tired with some muscle aches at 2:45 pm. I slept from 3:45 to 4:30 pm but was still tired and felt weak. I did feel hungry and made dinner over 30 minutes. However, this wore me out. I was even more tired and started getting dizzy. I almost fainted as I made my way to a chair to sit down. I couldn&#39;t eat because of slight nausea and cold chills. I was shaking for about 20 minutes. Eventually, I made it to my bed to lay down, but my legs were shaking as I walked up the stairs. At 6:00 pm, my temperature was 98.8 F. I was freezing a shivering for the next hour in bed under 3 blankets. My hands and feet felt like ice. At 8:00 pm, I had a fever of 100.2  F that lasted all night. My body ached all over, especially at the hips. I couldn&#39;t sit still and couldn&#39;t sleep until 4:00 am. I woke at 8:30 am with some milder aches and fatigue with a temperature of 97.6 F.

                                                Yesterday (3/31/21) after the shot (4:00pm) my arm at the injection site was sore.  This has continued into today.  No swelling or redness but my arm hurts to touch or move. Beginning this morning (4/1/21) around 7:30 am I started having a headache.  I took an ibuprofen which slightly lessened the pain but it has not gone away all day.  It worsens with activity. Starting around 8:30-9:00 am I started to feel nauseous and lightheaded.  I didn&#39;t take any medication for these symptoms.  They&#39;ve stuck with me all day. Starting around 11:30am I started to feel cold chills and body/muscle aches.  This has continued throughout the day. Starting around 2:45 pm I&#39;ve felt feverish, with severe cold chills.

                                                About an hour after injection (~9:15am), I felt mild fatigue and a very mild headache. The fatigue progressed throughout the day and made me very exhausted. About 8 hours after the injection, I had chills, still fatigued, mild headache, and about an hour later I ran a low grade fever (about 99*).  Took Tylenol to keep my fever down. Temp shot back up to 101* a few hours later (still having body aches, fatigue and chills, and some mild nausea at this point.) My fever broke about 19 hours after the injection. 24 hours after the injection, the injection site was sore and I had a moderate headache with mild nausea. This continued throughout the day so I rested. 48 hours after the injection, still soreness in my upper left arm from the injection with mild headache, mild nausea and small lack of appetite. 72 hours after injection, completely back to normal with some soreness in my upper left arm at injection site.

                                                I awoke at 6:45 a.m. feeling a bit sore in my arm, but relatively okay.  I was up for approximately ten minutes and then extended my arms over my head to stretch out some of the achiness and immediately regretted the action.  I began to feel dizzy and nauseous and saw black spots encroaching on my peripheral vision.  I washed my face to relieve some discomfort with no change.  I walked toward the bedroom to grab my glass of water when the black spots increased, clouded my entire vision, and I collapsed on the bed.  I then began to hyper-salivate and after waking my husband and catching my breath, I returned to bathroom, experienced diarrhea, and simultaneously vomited into the trash can.  The vomit tasted chemical and extremely acidic.  My body was also shaking uncontrollably during this time and I kept switching between chills and being too hot.  After I felt comfortable leaving the bathroom, I crawled back in bed but was shaking so much that I couldn&#39;t stop my teeth from chattering and could not get warm no matter that my husband placed an extra blanket over me.  I had taken my temperature before while I was in the bathroom and it read 94.6 degrees Fahrenheit.  I took it again in bed about twenty minutes later and it read 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.  My head was splitting and my arm ached, but I was eventually able to go back to sleep.  I felt better after sleeping for a few hours and drinking more fluids.

                                                I had the Janssen covid shot yesterday. The shot stung a little and made my arm sore. Later on in the evening I became tired (so far nothing I didn&#39;t assume would happen) so I took a nap. When I woke up, my arm stung worse than when I had the shot and the pain kept shooting up my shoulder into my neck. I went back to sleep, thinking it was just normal vaccine stuff. When I woke up this morning, I had chills, a fever of 101.7, and muscle aches. My body feels like I have a sunburn all over it. My right arm feels like it was stung by a scorpion. I feel dizzy and nauseous, and I have head fog. I feel the exact same way I did when I had COVID19, but with my arm hurting so bad, anything that barely touches it (such as clothes) shoots a stinging pain up my neck

Headache and nausea about four hours after shot. Fever of 102.6 about 7 hours after shot accompanied by chills/shaking worse than any fever I?ve had. Tylenol was taken around time of headache which may have delayed the fever and chills. Tylenol and ibuprofen were taken simultaneously every 5 hours starting that evening and throughout the night and all the next day. Food consumption was minimal due to nausea but hydration  was maintained.

                                                About 14 hrs after injection, I got really bad chills for a couple of hours, then got very hot and had a 3 timepoints of chest pains (I assume I had a fever at this time but didn?t verify). By 7am when I got out of bed, it felt like a truck hit me. I had a major headache, very fatigue, fever (checked at this point and it was 101), nausea, hotness/chills. By 12pm, I had an 100 degree fever, chills/hotness, and headache. By 6pm, I was only tired. Next day, I was back to normal with a little soreness in my injection arm.

                                                Within 3 minutes of getting the Janssen shot I started feeling really sick, lost my vision and all feeling in my hands. I sweated through all of the clothes and soaked the chair I was sitting in.  That night around 7 pm I got a migraine and felt really fatigued I couldn&#39;t stay awake and I was really sore. My chest hurt and so did my head. I was nauseated to no end The next day was worse. All day I couldn&#39;t stay awake. I felt so sore and sick to my stomach and I coint move too much because I was super dizzy. The next day I was still sick and dizzy  By day four I felt fine just dizzy.

                                                few hours after vaccination, I started to have severe headache, dizzy and abdominal pain. The headache and abdominal pain reached to their peak at night on the same day, and I took extra strength tylenol. I felt better after two hours. I still took the tylenol the following day since the severe headache and abdominal pain came back. It was relieved after a couple hours. The following five days, I had minor headache, felt dizzy and very tired.  I did not any more medicine. I got recovered a week since vaccination date.

I started feeling nauseous about an hour later. Then at about 9:00 pm, I started to feel really sick. I felt very tired and my whole body hurt. I had a low body temperature, 95 degrees. Chills, fever, shaking, nausea. Very SEVERE symptoms. Felt very disoriented. I thought I was going to pass out and faint. Vision blurry and seen white.  Pounding headache. Ears ringing. I could hardly walk that night, I was crawling on the floor. I felt out of breath. My heart was beating very fast. My left side of my chest hurt by my ribs. When I did wake up from sleep, I woke up with blood in my mouth and dried blood on my lips.

                                                The day I received the shot, I started to feel severe fatigue, headache, light-headed, and started running a fever about 6 hours after the shot was administered.  The next day (4/6) was worse. Severe fatigue, muscle aches, headache, loss of appetite, fever (101.5 was the highest I notice but seemed to be around 101.1-101.3 all day), and general flu like symptoms. However, I also started experiencing abnormal menstrual bleeding. I am on the Depo shot and have been for some time. Due to this, I do not usually experience any menstrual bleeding so I found this to be a little odd. It was not heavy but it was noticeable and contained quite a few clots.   Day 3 (4/7) was about the same except my fever came down and ranged from 99.8-101.1. Abnormal menstrual bleeding continued. New side effect this day included diarrhea.   Day 4 (4/8) I started to see improvement. No fever (that I could tell). Remaining side effects included mild headache, fatigue, diarrhea, and abnormal menstrual bleeding.   Day 5 (4/9), I had one of the worst nose bleeds I&#39;ve ever had in my life. I apologize for the graphic description but it lasted about 20 minutes and my bathroom looked like a crime scene after. Blood was pouring out of my left nostril and I threw two large clots that were about the size of slug (or slightly larger than a fun size snickers... I wish I had a better way to describe it). I&#39;ve had some bad nose bleeds, particularly when I was on Accutane, and this was worse! The rest of the day I felt like I was improving. Energy levels were better. No fever. Menstrual bleeding stopped. Only lingering side effect was mild headache and mild diarrhea.   Since then I&#39;ve continued to feel better and the diarrhea seems like it&#39;s improving.  Mild headache persists. Only new  item is an annoying twitch in my left eye that started on Monday (4/12).

                                                The week prior to delivery (3/22), I started feeling shortness of breath and a headache. I thought it was just normal pregnancy symptoms. That Friday (3/26), I noticed swelling in my ankles. I am a teacher so I asked my school nurse to check my blood pressure; it was high (for me) around 144/88. She said I should call my OB and let them know. I did, and they said to rest for the weekend and they&#39;d see me on Tuesday for my 29 week appointment.   We had a weekend trip planned. We took our son there. The next night, I didn&#39;t feel right. My belly felt hard to me and I wasn&#39;t feeling my daughter move as much, but soon after, I went to sleep. Our two year old son woke us up crying around midnight, and I noticed that I started bleeding when I went to the bathroom. My husband drove me straight to the emergency room. I was diagnosed with sudden and severe preeclampsia. My fibrinogen levels were 100% indicative of a placental abruption. They called the transport team in from hospital so they could transfer my daughter immediately after birth. At 5:57 am on 3/28, my daughter was born via emergency c-section. She is currently fighting everyday at the NICU in the hospital.  On Friday, 4/2 I was readmitted for severe preeclampsia to hospital. My blood pressure was 190/115. I had to receive another round of magnesium sulfate. I was released from the hospital on Sunday, 4/4.

I was wearing a fitbit and then noticed my heart Rate went up to the 90s and fluctuated between 90-110 bpm all night into the next morning.  I woke up every 2 hours  to a new symptom on top of what I was feeling already. It started with chills, then sweating, nausea and  a headache. I had a fever of 99.5 at the highest. And then the last time I woke up at 5 my heart hurt so bad, my whole chest muscle hurt with a sharp pain and It hurt to breath.  The next day I had a little headache and my body hurt, and I had cramping in my legs for a few days, but I also started my menstrual cycle on the 13th.  The leg cramping continued for a few days but only when I sat on my legs for too long.

I?m bleeding in my urine, stool, and vaginally. Period came early (unrelated to previous vaginal bleeding) and is not clotting. Just significant amounts of red blood, soaking through one ultra absorbency tampon an hour. I have a headache. Went to the ER and my platelets were (345) and my blood sugar low. My bp was 145/90 which is high for me, from the bleeding.  They said I have a ?higher chance of being bitten by a shark? than having a side effect. They diagnosed me with a single contusion and sent me home. Have been feeling worse since leaving the hospital.

I laid down to go to sleep at 8:30 PM and dosed in and out of sleep. Around 10:30 PM I had a fever of 100.7 degree Fahrenheit. Around 12 AM my fever broke and by 1:30 PM I started feeling better. I had a really bad headache all night and into the morning, so bad I could feel throbbing in my teeth. I still have some soreness in my left hip joint and shoulder/neck. I have also had diarrhea once around 12:30 PM today. I did have COVID-19 at the end of December 2020 into January 2020. Not sure if that makes a difference.

I took two pills of extra strength Tylenol and water and laid back down to break the fever and help with the aches and pains. I woke up around 9:30am on 3/13/21 and did not have and appetite all day. I was extremely fatigued all day and had no energy to get out of bed or do much.  On 3/14/21 I began to develop an appetite again around noon. I was still fatigued. My arm was very tender and itchy at the injection site and hurt to the touch. My 5:00pm on 3/14/21 I had more energy and the aches were gone but my arm was still hurting and sore.

The day after I recieved the covid vaccine Janssen, I started noticing the injection site getting red and swollen. By the next day it had grown in size and was itching rather badly. I could sleep from how badly it was itching and burning. It has been 6 days since I got the vaccine and it&#39;s still large and swollen and really itchy. I have been taking ibuprofen for the pain and using benadryl for the itching.

                                                I received the vaccine at 1:30 pm in the afternoon on 3/22/21 and immediately afterwards I felt fine. I waited my 15 minutes and had no signs of a reaction and was free to go. Later in the afternoon, around 3:15 pm, I began to feel a little fatigued and my arm was sore. Around 6:00 pm that same night, I developed a low grade temp of 99.8, I was very fatigued, had achiness all over, as well as my arm was very warm and tender.  I was unable to sleep through the night of 3/22/21 into 3/23/21 and got out of bed around 4: 30 am on 3/23/21 and had to call into work due to the pain. The pain was not an achiness but sharp throughout my whole body. Around 9:00 am, I took a pain reliever and was able to sleep for a few hours. Upon waking up around 1:30-2:00 pm, I was still hurting and was then nauseated as well. I tried to drink water and ate a few crackers to settle my stomach with no relief. At 5:15 pm on 3/23/21, I went to the bathroom and got in the shower to try to help with the pain. After a few minutes in the shower, I became extremely lightheaded and felt like I was going to be sick. I sat down in the bathtub and hollered for my mother to come help me because at this point, I felt like I needed to go to the hospital. Upon sitting down in the bathtub, I began to profusely vomit and started to lose feeling in my legs. My mother entered the bathroom and I explained what was happening and soon after my hands contracted and were stuck in an abnormal position. The pain was unbearable and I was unable to move them from that position. I was unable to get myself out of the bathtub so my mom then called for an ambulance. These symptoms occurred somewhere around 5:20-5:21 pm and EMS was called at 5:22 pm. After a few minutes, I was able to regain movement of my legs but my hands and fingers were still contracted and unmovable. I was able to help my mother enough to put my clothes on and to make my way outside to the front porch to get fresh air. After getting outside, I was accompanied by my mother and my neighbor whom is a nurse. My neighbor looked at my hands and noticed they were discolored and she attempted to straighten out my fingers to no avail. The pain in my fingers was sharp and excruciating but there was also a pins and needle type pain as well. I remained outside until EMS arrived. I was then transported to Hospital where I was seen in the ER for this. Upon arrival to the ER, the physician ordered labs and fluids and stated that apparently he had seen at least 2 other cases that day with a similar reaction to the vaccine. He explained that I was having an adverse reaction to the vaccine and that my hands should return to normal within 24-48 hours. I was then discharged home. As of 3/24/21, I was able to straighten my left hand out and my right hand, my fingers would straighten out, but they would return to a curled resting position. As of 3/25/21, I returned to work and I have some weakness in both hands with a slight discoloration of each hand as well. I am a nurse and work in an office and the physicians in my office commented on the color of skin upon seeing them. I was still very achy and fatigued. My arm was still sore and tender as well. As of today, 3/26/21, I am still achy as well as tired. My right hand has improved some but still returns to a curled resting position. The color of my hands has improved as well. I am a nurse and have seen many things throughout my career. This experience has been absolutely terrifying and I still have no answers as to why this happened to my body. I did my part by being vaccinated and was terrified that I was going to lose my life to it. I pray this does not happen to anyone else.

I also suffered from extreme body aches, fatigue, nausea, upset stomach, diarrhea. This lasted a full 24 hours before my fever went away. The following day I still had an upset stomach. I also developed a red welt at the injection site which lasted for about a week, was red, swollen, bruised and itchy. 11 days later I tested positive for COVID19 and had full fledged symptoms of COVID19 as well.

                                                I had immediate soreness after the vaccine does. Then at 7pm of the evening after getting my vaccine, I began to feel weak, get chills, and run a low grade fever. At midnight, my fever had increased to 101 and I began taking Tylenol (recommended by Pharmacy). I had sever body aches, muscle fatigue, joint paint, chills and nausea through the night and the next day. In the morning, I had excruciating pain in my abdomen and began vomitting. Later that  day, my fever increased to 102.7 (with Tylenol) and I called my regular doctor. She told me to continue to monitor and if my fever did not decrease by 7pm to go the hospital. Finally, my fever decreased to 101, muscle aches, chills and joint pain continued. I began vomitting uncontrollably for a short period of time. I was very dizzy and weak the remainder of the day. Saturday, my fever finally broke (I sweated all day) but my body was still weak and sore. I also had dizzy spells on and off. Sunday, I felt much better but was still very tired compared to my normal self. I had abdomen pain and burning on and off. I also got hive on my hands Sunday afternoon. After Benadryl, the hives went away but I still felt itchy all over.  Today (Monday), I still don&#39;t feel like myself, but it is the best I have felt since receiving the vaccine. I have never experienced anything like this and was miserable Thursday night, Friday and some of Saturday. It truly was a terrible experience.

                                                4/6: The vaccine burned as it went in. The nurse at the Pharmacy administering the vaccine made the comment: &#34;Oh, that&#39;s weird. Everyone who has gotten this batch (Johnson&amp;Johnson) today have complained of burning.&#34; 4/7: Experienced severe body aches, chills, nausea, sweat, and vomiting. Headache that lasted all day.  4/8- 4/9: A mild headache that waxed and waned. 4/10: After drinking four alcoholic drinks between 10A to 2P, about an hour apart each, I became violently ill. By the second drink I felt a little sick but passed it off for being outside in the sun. Not being told that we shouldn&#39;t drink after the vaccine I didn&#39;t consider that I shouldn&#39;t. Throughout the day I experienced several blackouts, nausea, chills and a severe headache that lasted until 2A until I was finally able to go to sleep. This was absolutely terrifying as I have never experienced anything like this. I have bits and pieces completely gone of this day. I did not drink enough to black out, nor have I ever experienced blackouts or ever drank enough to cause me to black out. I do believe this is connected directly to the vaccine. 4/11: The headache remained as well as dizziness and nausea. 4/12: The headache waxed and waned along with the nausea. 4/13: I still have a headache and mild nausea.

                                                About 6 hours after receiving the vaccine I felt bad enough to go to the Emergency Room, I did not go because I was hoping it would pass,  I felt 100 times worse than I did when I had Covid.  I had full body chills, I was shaking back and forth, my head was pounding so hard it felt like someone had a hammer to it, I got in a hot bath and it felt ice cold to me, I was throwing up, couldnt lay down because every part of my body that was touching something was in terrible pain.  Could not sleep.  The next day I had all of the same symptoms except I was sweating a lot along with everything else.  These symptoms lasted three full days.  It has now been exactly three week, I still have pain in my arm the shot was is, it hurts to raise it.  I also still have an incredibly awful headache that will not go away, I hadn&#39;t had a headache is years and years prior to this, I overall have not felt well ever since I got the shot and my reaction was incredibly awful.  Now I have concerns about my headache and body aches that still are not subsiding.

My back began to hurt and that then moved into my neck and muscles as a whole with a little headache. The next morning I took Tylenol which I then started to feel a little better but  then at approx 3PM, my muscles began to hurt again, I took another tylenol which did not seem to help and felt nauseated. I then took a shower hoping it would help, but instead thew up after getting out. For the remainder of the night - my overall body felt week and standing up for long periods, I felt dizzy.

                                                Headache (turned into a migraine), extremely drained of energy, lack of appetite, and felt off all day (4/9/21). The next morning (4/10/21) felt the same as the day before, however, had several episodes where I would get really light headed, dizzy, and nauseous. Went to Home Depot at 2:15pm (4/10) and while there my vision blurred and started to fade, I had ringing in my ears and couldn?t hear out of the right and barely was able to hear out of the left. I got very nauseous and I couldn?t breath. I managed to sit on something and put my head between my legs that helped. Fortunately my step- dad was with me and helped me outside while I could barely see and hear and he stated I was very pale. I was having a hard time talking or being conherent. Once outside the symptoms slowly cleared over about the next 6-7 hours. At 4:45pm my mom decided to take me to the doctor but the walk in had just closed and I went to the ER. They stated I had elevated d-dime and did a chest CT scan  to check for blood clots around 7:30pm (I believe not sure exact time) doctor stated they came back clear but when asked if he suspected that the episode and symptoms were due to a dissipated blood clot he would not directly answer it. I overheard him dictating his notes and he started he beloved as such. I have never experienced anything like this before. I still felt drained, headache (migraine), occasionally dizzy, and lack of appetite (4/11/21, 4/12/21) and still currently feel the same drained, migraine, lack of appetite, and occasionally dizzy.

The following day I was dizzy, tired, running a fever, and my injection site was very sore. I could not lift my arm above my head without being in pain. I was not able to eat anything the entire day. I attempted to eat some soup but threw it up. I woke up at 3am on Wednesday morning and drank some water but within 10mins I threw that up along with blood. At one point when I checked my temperature it was 104.8. By Wednesday afternoon I was still not able to eat anything but I was able to drink Gatorade. My fever did not break until Thursday afternoon. I was able to go back to work on Friday but my arm still hurt and was red and swollen. The injection site began to itch on Friday and continued all weekend. On Sunday my hand of the arm that had the injection got swollen for about an hour. It is now Tuesday of the week following my vaccine and I feel fine but my injection site is now purple.

In the early morning I also got stomachache cramps and felt hungry, but food didn?t help. It actually made me feel nauseous. By 6am the next day I had a serious migraine too - sensitivity to light. My eyes hurt. It actually was so bad I caved and took 2 liquid Advil?s to help with the pain. From there I slowly got better over the day but still had the above mentioned symptoms, just less intense. Around 8pm the fever came back and I called it a night.  Next morning I felt better, but still tired. Still had a headache but not a migraine. And occasional stomach aches. It?s now 2 days later and the head aches, arm soreness and occasional stomach aches have not gone away.

                                                I was asked to sit for 15 minutes in a chair.  Didn&#39;t have any reactions till i was being driven home and that&#39;s when the fever and headaches and abdominal pain started. I haven&#39;t had a chance to visit a hospital because I&#39;m too weak to stand let alone move.

                                                About 7 hours or so after I was vaccinated I began to feel a pulsing type of headache, but i was tired so I fell asleep. About 3 hours later (around 6am) I woke up with the worst headache I&#39;ve ever felt. On a  pain scale of 0 to 10 it was a solid 10. It was a splitting headache, a pulsing and crippling pain, it was also sensitive to light. Every time I moved or changed the direction in which I was looking the pain would surge through my head and paralyzed me. I took 1000 MG of acetaminophen and then half an hour later I took 800 MG of ibuprofen. The headache calmed down a for a while, but 8 hours later I was already feeling just as bad as when I felt the headache the worst, so I took another dose of acetaminophen and ibuprofen. The entire day went on like that, along with body aches, some nausea and fatigue. Throughout the next four days,  all of those symptoms gradually diminished. On the third day after vaccination, the injection site felt very sore; my whole arm would hurt every time I moved it.

                                                After receiving the COVID19 vaccine on Friday, March 19th at 12:30pm, I started feeling the normal side effects around 5pm. I had a low grade fever, chills, muscle aches, nausea and low energy through Saturday night around 7pm. When I woke up on Sunday morning, those side effects I no longer felt but instead I had pain in my vagina. All day, I assumed it was a yeast infection and would go to the store Monday to pick up Monistat. Monday morning, the pain had gotten worse.  My labia was very swollen and irritated and hurt when I urinated. At that point, I decided to look and found 10-15 lesions on my labia (both right and left side). I immediately called my primary care physican&#39;s office to make a same day appointment. My primary doctor was unavailable so I saw another doctor instead. She swabbed several of the lesions as she seemed to think that it was a herpes outbreak (which would have been my first). She wrote me a prescpription for Valacyclovir (10 days) and submitted my vaginal swab for HSV 1 and HSV 2 testing. Two days later I received negative test results for HSV 1 and HSV 2. I asked her for further testing as I was still in pain. I went back in for blood work: Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, CBC with Differential, Epstein Barr Virus AB Panel, Herpes Simplex Birus Antibody IGM, Herpes Simplex I/II IGG. All came back normal. I didn&#39;t have any old or new Herpes antibodies. This lead both her and my gynocologist to question whether or not this was a side effect of the vaccine.

I was fine early in the morning and then stated feeling nausea and I vomited 3 times and was unable to retain fluids or food. Everything I tried to consume something I would throw it up.  The vomiting and Dehydration was the worst, I had nausea in my first trimester so not sure if it&#39;s linked to my pregnancy.  I called my OB and spoke with them on the phone, they were concerned at on point but eventually was able to hold down an Gatorade and Tylenol . The other effect I had were mainly fatigue and headache but Tylenol helped with both of those.  I still feel tired but other than that no other symptoms.  By Friday evening I was feeling fine, the only thins that carried on was fatigue. I didn&#39;t experience  site pain, no redness, swelling or hurting.

                                                Immediately after the injection and for the next 36 hours, I had soreness in my right arm where the injection was.  Around 8:15pm, I started to develop chills. From there, I developed a fever, headache, neck soreness and body aches in my joints (particularly wrists, knees, elbows). I contained the fever with extra strength Tylenol taken according to the box instructions. The fever broke overnight.  I had a 99 degree temperature the next day (3:00 pm) after the vaccine, and experienced fatigue and body aches. Those symptoms largely subsided by the morning of 3/21.   I still (as of the PM on 3/22) have no appetite and a persistent feeling of &#34;fullness&#34; in my stomach.

                                                Received the covid19 vaccine at 11am. Started feeling very cold around 2pm (nail beds were turning purple). By 4pm I had a headache, body aches, upset stomach, tired, fever, and chills. My fever would go up and down, highest was 103.2 reached that temp 3 times. By 2am my mother drove me to the ER. I was diagnosed with a migraine and was given IV fluids and an IV migraine cocktail. After receiving the fluids and meds I felt much better and was released back home. I periodically have pain in the injection site.

Friend who had vaccine same day same exact symptoms also tested positive, were never near each other and no one else around me is sick.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I began to feel nauseous, almost like being car sick while looking at my phone. I also began to feel tightness in my chest. After my 15 minutes were up I asked the administrator of my shot if it was normal that I felt dizzy/chest tightness. They said it was probably fine and just to monitor my  symptoms. I went and sat in my car a few min and I began to feel very strange, it seemed very bright out, I felt weak, and my eyes felt very heavy. I wanted to get home so I started driving but on the highway, my heart beat was very fast and I began to feel like I couldn&#39;t swallow. At one point felt as though I might be about to choke so I pulled over because I thought I was going to have to dial 911 as my throat was feeling like it was closing up. I tried swallowing a few times with great effort and after a few minutes the sensation started to lessen. My throat hadn&#39;t closed up completely, however it did feel like it had swelled up.

Immediately after being vaccinated, pt. requested to remain seated.  The nurse noted that the pt. was getting pale so she suggested the pt. take off the surgical mask to get some air.  Before pt. had a chance to take off the mask she lost consciousness.  Together with another nurse patient was lowered onto the floor.  Pt. regained consciousness for 30-45 seconds and then began to have seizure like activity.  Her eyes rolled back and her body became stiff and began a jerking motion.  911 was called. This seizure like activity lasted 4-6 seconds at which time pt. regained consciousness and immediately sat up.  Pt was pale and diaphoretic.  BP 98/64, HR 78, Pulse Ox 99%.  Pt vomited multiple times.  Ice was applied to the posterior neck and a cold compress to the forehead .  EMS arrived and took vitals: BP 78/40.  Pt. was aware of person, place and situation.  Pt. was taken to Hospital accompanied by her husband.  Pt was called by me Friday and she was home.  All tests showed no sign of having a seizure.

The nurse gave me Tynenol at  around 1 am and ibuprofen at around 2:30 am. I was discharged at approximately 5 am on April 10, 2021 with a 98.4 degree temperature.

Took advil throughout. -Full body shivers despite warm or hot environment and comfort level Beginning about 30 hrs post vaccination vaccination and lasting about 6 hrs.  -Large bump at vaccination point started developing 72 hrs post vaccination. By 5 days post it was the diameter of roughly a baseball but only slightly raised, hot to the touch, very painful, restricted arm function and itched. That evening before bed (5 days post) self treated with 20 minute ice pack,  hydrocortizone cream and performing deep massage moving outward from vaccination point as long as could tolerate pain. Noticed extreme improvement the next morning: area had cooled to regular body temperature marked improvement in pain, size and fuctionality. Repeated &#34;treatment&#34; that evening (6 days post) and today (a few hours shy of 7 days post) area is still itchy, knot has decreased to the size of a bean, pain gone except when poked like a bruise. I will likely repeat self prescribed treatment more time.

Around 2:00 p.m. on 04/12/2021, i began to get bodyaches again as well as an accompanying migraine and was now experiencing some nausea and had begun to develop a yeast infection. On 04/13/2021, most symptoms had resolved outside of the continuing yeast infection. No symptoms were present on the morning of 04/14/2021, other than the yeast infection. The evening of 04/14/2021 i began to develop symptoms again in the form of a migraine, body aches, and nausea. The morning of 04/15/2021, i woke up with these same symptoms, but also had the chills again and was very fatigued.

Roughly 9 hours after shot developed joint pain/tickling/shaking chills in my legs (mostly in the thighs) and nausea.

Around midnight/1 am I was able to get the fever down using Tylenol and a cold bath and the sensation in my legs lessened.  The following day I was still a bit nauseous with a headache and low grade fever. The same leg sensation (but to a much lower degree) persisted for 2 days.

                                                Around 5:30 pm in the evening following my vaccine I started having chills, headache, nausea, and fever of 101. Chills got worse, whole body was shaking and shivering. Nausea progressed into constant dry heaving. Head was pounding with the worst pain I have ever felt in my life, worse than natural child birth and worse than running marathons. The nausea was so bad and I could feel my fever burning and getting worse. I was about to vomit so got out of bed to go to the toilet to vomit and the whole room started spinning completely out of control. My heart was racing and I could hear it and feel it pounding rapidly through my ears. I couldn?t walk and was so disoriented I crawled to the bathroom to throw up in the toilet. My husband heard me and came and picked me up off the bathroom floor and carried me to our bed. As the night progressed fever got worse, head was in almost unbearable pain, severe body aches over my whole body, heart racing and horrible nausea and dry heaving.  I made it through the night. For two days after I had a headache and fever  and nausea and body aches and couldn?t get out of bed to care for my children. By the third and fourth day I was able to get out of bed at times and still felt fatigue, nausea, headache and body aches. Anytime I would stand up for 10 days after the vaccine it felt like I was rocking on a boat. I am almost at 2 weeks and still feel fatigue and dizziness at times. On April 15th, 9 days after my vaccination I had symptoms of a blood clot in my leg. I went to the Emergency Room and was diagnosed with a superficial blood clot of the leg as well as swelling in the vein. I am thankful to be alive!

                                                Severe headache that lasted several days, extremely heavy period. Soaking overnight pads every fifteen - twenty minutes for three days while still leaking and dripping blood everywhere. Extreme cramps that I would rate at a 10/10 in pain. Absolutely debilitating.  Day four has been soaking overnight pads at a slower rate but still less than an hour per pad. Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Unable to keep food down but able to keep water down. No fever.

                                                Patient had immediate dizziness and nausea after vaccine administration at 1:00 pm.

Rash resolved within 15 min of administration.  She continued to have nausea.  At 1:45pm symptoms had improved and she was cleared to go home.

                                                Approximately 14 hours after the shot I woke up with extreme shivers (2:30am). I had shivers for 45 minutes until I climbed into a warm bath. The shivers stopped and I became extremely tired. I got out of the bath and had to climb back to bed because the room was spinning and I was nauseous. I did not have a fever at this time. I was able to go back to sleep. I woke up about 2 hours later sweating and with a fever of 100.7. I slept for another 3-4 hours and woke up symptom free. My morning went on normal. Ate breakfast and hung out. I was tired in the early afternoon and took a 4 hour nap which is not normal but expected since I didn&#39;t get a good night sleep with symptoms mentioned above in the middle of the night.   I also missed my period that month. My period was supposed to start March 30th and it never came. Confirmed I am not pregnant. Period returned in April on normal schedule.

                                                Mild headache and nausea set in shortly after the injection on Friday, but went away after rest and eating/drinking. My arm was sore for the entire evening. I woke up around 2am Saturday morning and became dizzy. I fell to the floor and passed out for a short period of time. When I woke, I was extremely nauseous to the point of nearly vomiting. I had chills and fever. I could hardly move due to weakness - I needed help getting back into bed. When I woke the next morning, I had 100.3 fever, I had a headache and my entire body was sore. My fever went away late Saturday afternoon, but I still felt mildly nauseous. It is Monday and I still have mild nausea and light-headedness. My arm is only slightly sore.

                                                I received the vaccine at 36 weeks pregnant. I am estimated to deliver April 16th.  About 8 hours after receiving the vaccine I noticed general bodily discomfort and achiness, as well as a loss of appetite and a headache. About 30 minutes after that I developed chills but no fever, and was fatigued enough to fall asleep an hour before my usual bedtime. I slept terribly in the night due to the achiness and pain at the injection site making it hard to lay on my side, which I have to do for pregnancy. I went to bed with chills but woke up sweating and discovered a fever of 100.2 around 12:45 AM. By 5:30 my temperature was down to 98. The following morning I continue to experience achiness, fatigue, decreased appetite, and a headache. I seem to have felt some pelvic cramping associated with pregnancy but it may be unrelated.

                                                I received the Janssen (J&amp;J) vaccine at 11:12pm on 3/5/2021. I went to bed with a slightly sore arm. I woke up the following day 3/6/2021 with a slight headache and feeling a little achy. At around 11:00-12:00pm on 3/6/2021 I started having a fever, chills, aches, an increasingly bad headache. For the next 18 hours I had a fever, shaking, aches, bad migraine headache, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. I felt increasingly sick and my lowest point was at around 9:00pm on 3/6/2021 when I vomited. Around 5:00-6:00am on 3/7/2021 I felt considerably better and no longer had a fever. I was exhausted and still had a headache. I was very fatigued for the next two weeks.   I was menstruating when I received the vaccine. My menstruation stopped when I was having side effects for about 2-3 days and then started again.  In addition, I have psoriasis and on 3/7/2021 my skin looked noticeably better than it had looked before I received the vaccine. The psoriasis I had on my hands almost completely disappeared. A few days later, my psoriasis looked worse than I had looked before I received the vaccine. Today 3/29/2021, my psoriasis is back to how it looked right before I received the vaccination.

I feel better today minus a headache  and did not require an in person visit but my ob recommended that I report since vomiting isn?t as common of a symptom and there isn?t much  data on pregnant women

                                                At around 6pm, it started with chills that made the chest lock up. After a dose of tramadol 50mg cut to 25mg, the chills began to subside. During the overnight and all day Sunday, it escalated to severe migraines, fever, sweating, sensory overload, muscle weakness, dizziness, tossing and turning, couldn?t get up, unable to eat due to severe nausea and vomiting, dehydrated.   By Monday, the migraine, sweating, muscle weakness,  and nausea reduced, dizziness and fever stopped. Could slowly start to get up. It took until Friday for the rest to stop and return to normal.

I woke up to my husband holding my head and yelling my name. I had been seizing and had bitten my tongue. I was very white and nauseous and cold and shaky. They gave me water and a cold pack. The seizure probably only lasted for 5 seconds but it&#39;s hard to say. I felt very fatigued afterwards. I stayed for 10 more min and drank water and then they sent me on my way.

I wasn&#39;t able to get up and my arm swelled up really bad.  I was having streak in my vison and really bad dey eyes and mouth.  I had a fever on going for about 3 weeks straight. I called my Doctor the following day and she said it was a normal reaction, if it get&#39;s worse to call her again. I called her again because it got worse, my neck got swollen. left arm was trembling, lymph nodes were swollen, leg leg was pulsating. I started having chills and hot flashes ( I still have some till this day). My Doctor recommended seeing a specialist- Neurologist, Infectious Disease Dr.  The Neurologist said he can see where I get the trembles but does not  want to put me on medication and see if it goes away on it&#39;s own. I have a follow up with him regarding trembles, headache, flashing in my eyes. The Infectious Disease Dr. I&#39;m following up her her again regarding my arm swelling, they prescribed me steroids but had not gone down.  Since all of this I have been very fatigue, this is everyday.

The feeling continued to get stronger and I began sweating and feeling nauseous. I felt like I was going to throw up and/ or pass out. I was about to go get someone and let them know, but then it started easing back off again. It came and went all within about five minutes. I hung around the site a little longer than instructed to be safe, but felt fine and left. Two hours later, I&#39;ve had no other symptoms besides soreness in my arm and a slight headache.

                                                Within about 30 mins of the shot I became extremely lethargic. Hard to keep my eyes open. The injection site was extremely hot to touch and very sore. While the rest of my body was of normal temperature. Shortly after, I?d say about 45 minutes after injection, came the cold chills. I was freezing cold and shaking  fallowed by a fever. I became very foggy. It was hard to keep a conversation and had extreme waves of nausea. My mouth would salivate like the vomit was coming. I never actually vomited. But that continued  for the next 36 hours. I had to call out of work yesterday. Starting 24hrs after injection. I could not get out of bed. My body was very weak. Aches everywhere, I was freezing cold shaking with chills yet waking up in my bed covered in sweat. I was extremely restless and kept waking up to put a cold towel on my head to try to break my fever. At this point my headache was so severe. Any movement felt like my head would explode.  It?s now 48 hours after the injection my head is still pounding and my body still full of aches. Left arm is still really sore. I truly regret taking the vaccine. And would recommend others to not take it until further testing goes into this product.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I began by feeling stiffness and soreness in my joints and muscles, particularly my back and lower body.  The pain and stiffness worsened, and I began to feel ill similar to a common cold. Approximately 12-18 hours after receiving the vaccine, my symptoms worsened so much that I could hardly stand or move around, and began throwing up. This continued and worsened as my entire body felt pain and stiffness, I felt very weak and fatigued, and I was throwing up violently with frequency. I threw up so much and with enough force that I started to see bright red blood in my spittle and vomit. I had a severe headache accompanying these other symptoms.  I also had problems with homeostatic temperature regulation  and was simultaneously sweating profusely and very warm to the touch while feeling like I was cold.  I was shaky and experienced tremors and twitches in my hands, arms, legs, and feet. I kept throwing up and experiencing these symptoms for approximately 72 hours after recieving my vaccine.  I was virtually incapacitated for those three days of severe illness-like symptoms.

                                                Six hours after injection of vaccine, I experienced nausea, moderate chills, headache, and a low fever which lasted for 6 hours. I also had numb fingertips which lasted for around 20 minutes right after the chills really set in. I&#39;m not positive its related but two nights after my vaccine injection, I woke up at night because my feet were itching and hot. They also had the pins and needles sensation and these symptoms lasted around 20 to 30 minutes. I have never had that happen before so I assume it was vaccine related.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after injection, I passed out. Witness said that I was unconscious for approximately 1 minute. My body shook, and it appeared that I had a seizure. Immediately upon waking I started vomiting and having uncontrollable bowel movements for about an hour. I felt confused for about 30 minutes and was unable to speak for a few moments upon waking. When I arrived at the hospital I was still vomiting and having uncontrollable bowel movements. I was given fluids and zofran and sent home without further testing.

For the next week the chest pain persist and got worse. I experienced severe chest pains, struggled with breathing at night, was extremely tired and felt worn out.  I had sharp pains throughtout my body so I went to the ER where a EKG and D-Dimer test was perfomed and was advised it was elevated and I left.  I went to the ER later that day who checked the D-Dimer who advised it was normal and was I  was released from there as well after monitoring.  The next day I began having sharp pains in my stomach and diarreah which prompted me to now go to hospital where a CT scan, X-Ray and EKG was perfomed there also which all results came back normal and advised I reach out to a Cardiovascular Specialist for the Chest pains and I have an appointment scheduled for 4/21/21 for further followup on that

Around 7:00 pm that evening I started to experience the normal symptoms that they had advertised. Yes, I felt like I COVID again for about 48 hours, but nothing alarming.   On March 12, 2021, I went to an appointment with doctor due to extreme abdominal cramping and very heavy period.  This is not totally out of the norm due to my infertility, but I felt like something was off. I had random abdominal bruising and ruptured cyst pain; which I am still experiencing. She ordered an ultrasound to rule out a mass in my uterus due to the extreme pain and bruising.   On March 22, 2021, I woke up at 3:00 am with extreme stomach pain and extreme diarrhea.  As the morning went on I began to feel worse and worse. Other symptoms I experienced were; severe headache, shortness of breath, heartburn (I felt like I was having a heart attack), nausea, back pain, and extremely tired.  At 6:30 am  took me to the ER due to my worsening symptoms. Everything checked out fine and they thought I could have an ulcer, but I wanted to make you aware of these symptoms that I experienced.   I still have days that I experience some of these symptoms, but they have been under control and monitored closely.

When she regained consciousness she stated that she felt nauseous and was seeing double. 911 was called. EMTs arrived and checked her alertness and how she was feeling. The EMTs then took her off in a stretcher to the hospital out of an abundance of caution due to brief loss of consciousness.

After about thirty minutes, I was able to calm down and my pulse/heart rate dropped down to a level that still seemed elevated, but no longer caused a great deal of concern. This event was followed by nausea for the remainder of the day.

My temperature about an hour later was 105. I took 1000 mg of Tylenol right away and put a cold rag on my head and tried to go to sleep. A couple hours later my fever started breaking, when it was 102.7 I was a sweaty mess and extremely hot and puked a lot.  My fever and other symptoms went away within about 7 hours after my fever started breaking.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Mid Saturday night I woke up to chills and was shaking so bad I couldn&#39;t fall back asleep even after adding another layer of clothes and blanket. Sunday morning I was still very cold and tired from not sleeping. I developed body aches but they were everywhere not just my arm. I was very fatigued and didn&#39;t have an appetite. The worst part was getting a migraine with extreme light sensitivity. I couldn&#39;t stand to be around any windows without blinds. I spent the day in my bedroom sleeping with the curtains closed and an eye mask on. By that night, the migraine had subsided but I was adding hot flashes to the problem list. Had a pretty restless night again on Sunday. Woke up Monday to the light sensitivity back but not as severe. I took the day off work because I couldn&#39;t handle looking at a computer screen all day. By about 1pm I was feeling mostly back to normal. My arm is still sore near the injection site and I&#39;m a bit fatigued at times but those are the only things remaining.

                                                4 hours after the vaccine, I started to get body aches and chills and they continued to worsen. I started to develop a low grade fever 8 hours after the shot. 13 hours after the shot, I had a 104.1 fever. Along with the fever, I experienced severe body aches and chills, nausea and a horrible headache. I couldn?t walk as my body was so weak and my vision was blurry. About 15 hours after the vaccine, my fever went down to 102. I was able to get up and walk to my kitchen to take some Advil. My fever broke 20 hours after the vaccine with the medicine. I?m still experiencing severe body aches, headache, nausea and chills and it has been about 30 hours after vaccine. I did have covid 3 months ago, and the symptoms from the vaccine were much worse than the symptoms I had with actual covid.

Headache and body aches became intense by 6:20pm on the day I received the vaccine. I took Tylenol Extra strength which helped the body aches and lowered the fever a bit but did little for the headache. Chills started around 10pm accompanied by vomiting and severe diarrhea at 1am. Blood pressure spiked at 142/101 shortly after third vomiting episode. Called family to take me to ER but didn?t end up going because I was able to get vomiting and blood pressure under control by 3am. Figured doctors would just hook me up to an IV of fluids and send me on my way anyway, not something I can afford. No more fever or chills since 4am on 3/14/21. Headache and diarrhea and slight nausea still persisting 29 hours after the shot. Treating symptoms with Tylenol, water, pedialyte, chicken broth, and toast diet. Unable to care for my children, worst I?ve felt in years. Regularly get the flu shot with no side effects.

I seen my PCP and he sent me for testing to rule out Blood clots and that came back ok, but I&#39;m still having the shortness of breathe.  If I get worse he advised me to go to the ER and if im not feeling better to call him in three days.

                                                On the night of Monday 15, I started to have a fever over 102.2 degrees. Took Ibuprofen for the fever. At 3:00 AM of the same day started to feel weak. On that moment I lost consciousness and passed out. In my opinion, I experimented a down on sugar, which had never happened before. My husband was able to catch me and sat me on the floor. A minute after I recovered and my husband gave me fruit (Melon) to raise my blood sugar. On that moment I had lots of nauseas and diarrhea. I was feeling weak and dizzy all night and the next day. Today Wednesday March the 17 I have been feeling much better.

As of this morning, Friday 19 March, I?m still exhausted, but  all other symptoms have finally resided.

                                                I was fine from 10am until 3:30pm on the day of injection. I started to feel feverish and chills at 3:30 and it progressed into a 99.2 fever with all over body aches and a headache and chills. I took alkasletzer cold medicine with Tylenol in it to help with the fever. It got the symptoms down where I could move and stood in the hot shower for 30 minutes to help warm me up. I felt slightly better and still had fever symptoms and severe body aches. I started feeling unable to move due to the fever symptoms again around 9pm and took 2 extra strength Tylenol that eventually worked and I had some nausea with that. I hadn?t been able to eat because of the symptoms and the nausea could have been from taking meds on an empty stomach. I finally felt able to eat around 10pm and had some food and went to bed. I could barley sleep all night and was tossing and turning due to fever. My nose started to get runny around 10pm before I went to bed. I woke up the next day and still had the fever symptoms, body aches and the worst headache I have ever had, a 10 on the pain scale. I took another 2 extra strength Tylenol and went to sleep for 2 hours. I woke up and could tell the fever had broken and my head was still in pretty severe pain- about a 7 on the pain scale.  I was incredibly fatigued the entire day and felt hot and cold throughout the day. I was incredibly weak and needed a lot of rest. I still didn?t sleep well through the night and woke up friday feeling fatigued. I expended some energy in the am at the dog park and had to sleep for 3 hours during the day which is atypical for me. I woke up Saturday morning (today) still feeling a headache and exhaustion. I will see how the rest of the day goes and am hoping to feel better and don?t know when the symptoms will stop.

                                                Most websites said 1-2 days for side effects to kick in but I was rocked pretty hard within the first 12 hours. The biggest symptoms I had were severe body aches, debilitating chills, fluctuating fever, headache, and no appetite.  4/1/21: * 11:15am: Vaccine administered * 12pm-6pm: Arm soreness, feeling cold/experiencing some chills, minor headache and stomach ache (I felt a little off but couldn?t tell if it was real or in my head) * 5:30pm: I walk home from work, which takes about about 35 minutes. Regret the decision about 10 mins from home due to onset body aches and fatigue  * 6pm: I go straight to bed freezing with crippling chills, body aches, and a headache * 8pm: Extreme nausea kicks in, I take Advil and cannot stomach more than one bite of food; still experiencing chills and body pain * 9pm: 100.7 fever, the chills subside and I start to get hot * 10:15pm: I finally eat some food, drink more water, body still aches, start to get chilly again  * 10:45pm: My fever is down to 99.3, my ears really hurt, like, ear-infection-style pain  * 11:15pm: 12ish hours post-vaccine, I have severe body aches, I alternate between really hot and cold, take more Advil and go to bed (finally fall asleep at midnight)  4/2/21: * 6:15am: Wake up; I spent the night tossing and turning with extreme night sweats. At this point I still have a pretty bad headache and painful body aches, specifically in my lower back and legs; fall back asleep * 8am-9am: Wake up and take more Advil. My whole body hurts. Toss and turn for a bit more. Small fever?99 degree temperature. Make coffee but have absolutely no appetite. * 9am-10am: So sweaty, fever is fully breaking * 11am: No more fever, slight headache, and body aches seem to be subsiding * 11:45am: Almost exactly 24 hours later and feeling good, comparatively speaking. Finally eat a bagel * 5:30pm: After lunch, I took a nap. My body aches have completely subsided, no fever. I still have a small headache and my ears still ache. But overall, I feel pretty normal! Just a little tired but probably from lack of sleep last night.

Took acetaminophen around 1:30am and the chills subsided. Then had a fever of 101 degrees. Head ache started the same time as the chills. The next day I had full body aches, headache, nausea. Symptoms subsided as the day went on. The following day, still had some nausea.

                                                5 hours after injection I got a headache, 101.0 fever, chills, full body aches, sever nausea and vomiting (every 20-30 minutes for 20 hours). Vomiting and Nausea subsided after 20 hours (25 hours after injection). Fever, chills, strong body aches (especially in legs) and headache lasted another 24 hours. It is now 72 hours post injections. Only remaining symptom is mild soreness at injection side but digestive system is still trying to recover from the intense vomiting that lasts 20 hours. I probably should have gone to the hospital but I don&#39;t have insurance so I tried to wait it out because I can&#39;t afford the bill and luckily I seem to be ok now.

Symptoms started about 7.5 hrs after injection, mild at first but quickly became severe. When I felt well enough the next morning to try to take another pain/fever reducer, I did with no vomiting and was able to eat a small breakfast, and now it is about 27 hrs after injection and I feel almost 100% again. :)

                                                Roughly 10 hours after injection, moderate muscular pain at injection site, and severe pain in old lower back injury - chronic bulging disc. Back pain onset was severe enough to wake me up from sleep and persisted despite use of OTC pain management. Used 2x extra-strength 500mg acetaminophen, only dulled pain, then 600mg ibuprofen approximately 8 hours later to same result. As of 27 hours post injection, pain is still moderate and disruptive. Lack of sleep and pain make it hard to determine if the fatigue is a unique symptom or purely the result of the pain symptoms. In a non-measurable manner, having had this back injury for over 10 years with multiple reoccurrences, it feels like the joint/disk swelled enough for it to press on the spinal nerves despite attempts to mitigate with ice, elevating feet and head to open intervertebral space.

Later that evening came muscle pain, chills, high fever, nausea, vomiting, and migraines. The next day, most side effects went away except for the looming headache. Since the vaccine, patient has been experiencing episodes of dizziness and lightheadedness. There was an article that came out today as it relates to blood clots being a possible side effect of the vaccine and to report any feeling of headaches or possible symptoms that may be related to that.

Due to this my body broke out in red splotchy hives around my hands and legs.  I immediately injected myself with a Epi pen and after a few hours all of these symptoms went away.

Symptoms started the afternoon after the vaccine and got worse as the night progressed, becoming very severe around 8pm. I took generic NyQuil tablets and was able to sleep for a few hours, and was woken up after that by joint pain. Joint pain persisted Saturday (moderate, treated by ibuprofen) and Sunday (mild, no ibuprofen needed.)

As I was laying down trying to sleep my heart rate increase to approximate 151bmp for approximately 9 mins and remained above 110bmp all night. When I woke up the next morning around 7:25am my heart rate was still approximately 110 bmp and I had a severe headache and nausea. After taking an extra strength Tylenol and eating a piece of bread I went back to sleep for 90ish mins and woke up feeling  a little better. At that point my heart rate had dropped below 100 bmp.

My injection site it still warm to the touch and a little red and swollen, but is looking better. I also had stomach pains in the evening Friday and Saturday night that happened when I was nauseous too.

                                                I received the vaccine at 3:50 pm and by 9:45 I had the typical side effects --muscle aches, minor pain at the injection site, and chills.  Within an hour from that I also had a terrible headache, nausea, and my skin hurt to touch.  I slept most of the next day, save for 5 or 6 hours.  Starting on 3/30/21 (exactly two weeks from receiving my vaccine) I started having sore skin.  No rash, red marks, itching, just hypersensitive to touch, even with clothing.  This started on my right arm right above the elbow.  The following day the pain had moved to inside both arms right above the elbow.  The day after that, the pain was more intense and was straight across my stomach at belly button height, and across my lower back at that same height.  It was more intense for two days and hurt whether anything was touching my skin or not.  It was very uncomfortable.  In the days following it continued to move to different places on my body.  Legs, bottom of feet, palms of hands, ankles, hips, groin, lower back.    Sometimes it just hurts, sometimes it&#39;s like a prickling, sometimes the skin in that area aches -- especially when on my hands. It&#39;s also very sensitive to anything cold.  Again, if you look at my skin though you can&#39;t see anything.  There&#39;s no visible signs of something being wrong.  It also stopped for a day or so, or just lessened so much that it wasn&#39;t that noticeable, but then returns.  That&#39;s happened twice where I thought this was finally over, only to have it return the next day.

                                                Nausea set in immediately, shortly after fever and chills began. By dinner time that evening the intense migraine was overpowering, the chills/nausea/muscle pain was intense. The chills went away on the third day after the shot. Muscle pain, fatigue, soreness, discomfort with breathing, headache, abdominal pain/swelling are still prominent.

That night was flu like symptoms (chills, sweating, body aches, food tastes funny, etc.). On 4/12 I got a terrible headache, blurry vision, and stomach pains. On 4/13, started to feel better, but stomach still had pains and food tastes funny.  Today is 4/14 and I&#39;m am still more tired than usual and still have some stomach pains.

                                                About 5 hours after shot, I started feeling weak, tired, and nauseas with a slight headache.  I had discomfort trying to fall asleep. I woke up at 12:43AM with a throbbing headache. I was hospitalized at 18 for viral meningitis, and this was a similar, intense pain. It felt like I had a crown on,  and that crown on my head caused a very intense, throbbing, debilitating pain. I also had chattering teeth, shaking with a freezing fever. I eventually fell asleep and woke up again at 2-something. My fever and headache still intense, but now I was drenched in sweat and burning up. I wanted to get up and find my thermometer--I remember digging through my drawers and closets around my apartment,  I remember speaking but no recollection what I was trying to say (I live alone), and I remember seeing my reflection looking glazed over. I don&#39;t remember getting back in bed but woke up again after 5AM. I still had a bad headache, though less severe, and felt my body was alternating very hot sweating and very cold freezing--like it was mix and matching. I eventually fell asleep again and woke up around 7:45AM. I was fatigued with a fever and chills all day.  I found my thermometer and went to sleep with a 100.3 fever that night. I was much better next day, just slight fatigue.

The fever and muscle aches lasted until the following morning. Around 12pm is when I began expecting some stomach discomfort/sharp pains on the upper left hand side of my stomach. It began to increase in intensity around 4pm when I began to get nauseous. 5-6pm is when I began vomitting, and decided to go to the ER after the pain reached a level 8-9 and my face and limbs felt numb. I was admitted to the emergency room at 11:30pm and was given a CT Scan where it was discovered I had appendicitis. Wednesday evening I underwent surgery, and was discharged Thursday 4/15. I am still experiencing a slight fever and soreness at the injection site on my left arm.

                                                The first 24 hours were very difficult for me. I have never been so sick in my life. I got the typical muscle aches, chills, etc. In fact I got every side effect listed plus more. I want to discuss the other side effects. On day 3 I started to develop extreme chest pain and pressure. It is a dull pain as if someone if sitting on my chest that will not go away. I also started to experience sudden bouts of dizziness and vertigo. It will not go away. Today is Day 7 and I spent the night in the emergency room because my chest pains got so strong. However, all the work up came back okay. I also have this strange feeling of electrical shocks running thru my head, those last about .5 seconds and go away, but it is a very weird feeling I have never experienced. I also have a strange desire to constantly burp, when I do my chest pain feels better. If I don&#39;t burp my ears start to feel full and sometimes they ring. Its Day 7 and I still feel SO miserable. Why id no one speaking about these chest pains? I know 5 people who have experienced the same.

She received her vaccine around 2:00 p.m. She began developing itchiness in her palms/soles of feet and scalp that quickly developed into a a welt like rash about 3-1/2 hours after receiving the vaccine while on a walk with her husband; this was shortly followed by facial swelling over her right eye.  They made it home and she got in a cold shower to cool down, became dizzy, started seeing spots and had difficulty breathing. Her husband called EMS and she was hypotensive when they arrived.  She was given 2 doses of epinephrine (0.2 mg each per ED note) and a dose of Benadryl which helped. Shortly after the 2nd dose, she began having difficulty swallowing, maintaining the ability to breathe through her nose. She was given a 3rd dose of epinephrine and transferred to the ED; during transport an IV was started with an epinephrine drip. She was seen at Emergency Department; she was given IV fluids, solu medrol, tryptase level and had a normal EKG.  She was discharged with an epi pen prescription. Tryptase is still pending at the time of her visit. She started a new prenatal vitamin at 11 am 4/28/21. Otherwise, she reports no new foods, medications or topical products. She did eat before going on a walk, pepper jack cheese, wheat thins, and black bean hummus. She is pretty sure she was not stung by a bee prior to onset of symptoms yesterday.   Interestingly she reports recent urticarial episodes that occurred in February of 2021. These occurred when she was visiting her in-laws and occurred in the middle of the night, 2 nights in a row during the middle of her visit.  She has never had hives previously.  She reports no family history of hives or anaphylaxis.  She reports no use of new topical products or medications.

I went to the Emergency room the night of the shot.  I was diagnosed with a bladder infection. The urge to gag was constant. I was given some nausea medicine in the ER and it helped a little I became dehydrated after a week. I had no appetite and had the gag reflex problems for three weeks.  I was diagnosed with a kidney stone about three weeks after vaccination. My anxiety was also bad during that time. I have been feeling better, less anxious and eating more for the last two weeks.

                                                The day after the vaccine I had a low-grade fever and felt bad. I was extremely fatigued and I felt weak. It almost felt like the flu. I had nausea at night and I felt flushed. I consulted with  Urgent Care and they asked me to come in and get a COVID-19 test which was negative. Those symptoms lasted a full week. My period is also out of sync and it lasted longer than usual for a total of two weeks. It kept coming and going. It normally only lasts five days and it is consistent. I was also having cramping on my left lower abdominal region.

                                                Around 3:00pm on 3/7/21 I began to feel a little tired. But 3:45pm I was experiencing muscle pain through my body at only continued to get worse. At 4:30pm I took 400mg of ibuprofen since sitting, walking, and lying down were all painful. Relief came around 5:30pm and I was able to nap for an hour. At 6:30pm I awoke and attempted to eat, as I was beginning to feel nauseous. At 8:30pm I laid down again, my symptoms returning and worsening. I was now experiencing chills with my muscle pain and a headache. Pain was located throughout my body and my skin was sensitive to the touch. At 10:30pm I began shaking violently and struggled to feel warm, despite my skill feeling hot. My temperature was not taken. Another 400mg of ibuprofen was taken and one 350mg chewable of Tums anti-acid was eaten. It was not until 12:30am that I was able to sleep again.  The morning of 3/8/21 I was still fatigued and sore. Moving was difficult and painful and nausea was still present, and my headache returned. I was unable to eat despite trying. At 10:00am I took two tablets of Excedrin Migrain and napped for almost two hours. Currently, my muscle aches are minimal and my headache has improved. This may however be due to the medication.

I started vomiting every hour from 1:30pm to 7pm the following day, Friday 3/12/21. After my first time vomiting I took two, 25mg MECLIZINE tablets but they did not help.  I could not keep anything down. I tried Water, Ginger Ale, Crackers, and Gatorade.  The all came back up within the hour. It got to the point where I was throwing up foam and green bile because my stomach was empty. I tried to eat again around 10pm and threw up again around 11:25pm. The following day, Saturday 3/13/21, I felt fine when I woke up until I started moving around. I threw up red vomit twice around midday and decided not to eat or drink anything and rest. Later that evening, around 7:30pm, I was able to eat a bland salad that didn&#39;t come back up. Today. 3/14/21, I am back to normal but my throat, stomach, and lower back are all sore from vomiting. I would NOT recommend this vaccine or get it again!

                                                Yesterday I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I was the last appointment, so they observed me for 5 minutes, and I left. After riding in the car for a few minutes, I noticed that I was having a hard time breathing and my throat felt like it was starting to swell. By that time, the clinic was closed, so I went to the emergency room just in case and sat in my car since they didn&#39;t allow people to sit in the waiting room because if covid.  It started becoming increasingly difficult to breathe, and I was feeling more and more swelling of my throat and tongue. I was having a lot of dizziness, nausea, facial flushing, palpitations, and some mild confusion. I then started getting numbness in the bottom half of my face. Over time, the numbness spread, mostly staying on the left side of my body (face, scalp, lower arms and legs, left side on tongue and inside of mouth). I also started getting a prickling burning pain sensation for brief periods of time where I had numbness. I had decided that if my breathing worsened at all, I would go to the er even though I can&#39;t afford it.   After about an hour and a half, my breathing started to feel less constricted and like there was less resistance. The swelling in my throat was mostly in the upper throat where I had difficulty swallowing but not as much difficulty breathing. The numbness continued to get worse and was sometimes disappearing and reappearing in the same spot.  At 9:30 pm we went to go get some benadryl. I continued feeling less and less swelling and having an easier time breathing. At that point, I went home. Once I was home, my breathing continued to improve and the numbness started to dissipate.  In the middle of the night, I started itching and getting widespread hives and getting a sharp burning pricking pain that would last a few seconds in different areas. The numbness also started coming back mostly in my face. I continued to have difficulty swallowing.  I am feeling much better today. I still feel some slight swelling in my throat when I swallow, but my breathing is fine. I&#39;m still itchy and occasionally breaking out in hives. Im having mild lower facial numbness. I&#39;m also starting to get the normal side effects of fever, headache, arm soreness, and body aches. I&#39;m taking benadryl every 4 hours.

                                                About a minute after I had the injection, my arm started hurting and it felt like hot water was coursing through my veins. I got an immediate headache that progressed into light headedness, my vision got blurry and I saw colors and then I started to lose my hearing, it felt like there was cotton in my ears. The nurses said I went pale and they called it a panic attack, but it was unlike any panic attack I have ever had in my life. I?ve had my TDAP updated a few years ago and got a flu shot and did not feel anything like this. I was rolled out of the room on a wheel chair because I was too dizzy to walk and then threw up several times into a bag and peed myself. It took about 20 minutes before I felt normal again.   The following day my arm felt numb and incredibly sore, I couldn?t raise it that far up without excruciating pain. I felt weak, fatigued and dizzy and was unable to use the bathroom. I had fever sweats and chills on and off. I was not able to sleep well, but I think that?s because of the pain in my arm.

Started experiencing fogginess and feeling cold at 1:00 am 20Mar2021. Went to bed at 1:00 and dreamed of being sick until waking up at 8:30 am 20Mar2021. Woke up and was very weak (could not push toothpaste through toothpaste tube), almost passed out in trying, so I sat on the floor. Tried getting back to bed and was extremely nauseous and started vomiting. After that, I had the sweats/fever/chills for a couple hours (until ~11:00am), and was fatigued until 4:00 pm. Spent most of the day sleeping, unable to do anything. Today, 22Mar2021, feel slight tingling on palm of left hand and fingers. Injection site is still sore and bruised

But the exhausted next day - I went home from work early that day. Friday, I got a rash  - very itchy and sore  (it felt very tender when touched)- on my left side (abdomen). It spread around the left side on my back and to my stomach. I say my doctor on this Tuesday (virtual appt) said it was Shingles - Valtrex - to help it heal faster. The rash is starting to scab over and is peeling now.  It&#39;s getting better.

When I woke up in the morning I had a headache, muscle aches, slight difficulty breathing with chest heaviness, and fatigue.  At 2 am on March 8 I awoke with dizziness and room spinning, sweating, weakness and lightheadedness, and nausea. Later that morning most of the symptoms subsided except for slight lightheadedness. By March 9 all side effects had resolved.

By midnight, I had a fever of 100.2, nausea, intense headache (specifically around the eyes) and overall significant discomfort. The fever lasted overnight. Vomiting occurred on several occasions shortly after midnight for a few hours and again around 6 am. The following day, my fever did go down yet I maintained a headache and some nausea. After 3 days, adverse events were resolved. Treatment consisted of tylenol and fluids. I did not contact my a physician, so no medical tests/lab work was completed. For background, I have never experienced a serious event with a vaccine, besides general fatigue.

I took Tylenol which helped with the fever. The next day I had some minor aches and dizziness. Later the same day, I had  sharp aches/pains down my back and an upset stomach. That night I had a fever again but not as high. Today, two days later, I feel back to normal with the occasional ache or cramp.

                                                Almost immediately, I had pain in my arm that shot into my shoulder when the vaccine was being injected into my arm. I did not mention it to the pharmacist since I figured it was normal. I sat for 15 minutes as instructed, but  other than feeling sore, I was normal. So we left. After about another 15 mins, My head started for feel &#34;drunk&#34;. I contemplated pulling over since I was driving home, but decided to get home asap.  As time went by, my head felt more and more cloudy, fuzzy, heavy and as if I&#39;d been drinking alcohol. That night, I couldn&#39;t sleep. I even took hydrocodon with tylenol (the pain was that bad) and an ibprofin. It helped a little. I finally got to sleep at 3am, Just to wake at 7am for work. All day, I could not focus, my head was super fuzzy. I had a bad headache, I felt super sick. My stomach also hurt and I couldn&#39;t lift my arm. I tried taking a nap half way through the day because I kept making mistakes at work. It did not help how I felt. Since then, my symptoms have eased but now I seem to have a bad case of acid reflux, which I didn&#39;t used to get randomly.   I have not been to my dr yet and I haven&#39;t done anything else for it. I was informed that I should report my symptoms by a family friend.

Being in a car is also making me sick.

I soon had a 103.7 fever with chills and a terrible splitting headache. My symptoms lasted through the night. I took one 200mg Ibuprofen at 03:30 saturday morning/it didn&#39;t seem to help much. Most of the day saturday I had a headache that was manageable and 100.2 degree fever. Saturday evening I was fever free and had a dull headache. Sunday, I was exhausted.

                                                Started with chills pretty shortly after the vaccine was injected.  After about 6 hours I could tell I was not feeling great.  My husband said I looked very pale and out of it all of the sudden.  I became extremely tired and disoriented.  I don?t remember driving myself home that evening after picking up my kids from dance.  By the time I was home it was now around 8 pm.  I was so cold my entire body was trembling.  I kept taking steaming hot showers but I couldn?t feel it, I was still freezing and shaking.  I was very weak and started having extremely horrible body aches and pains.  Specifically my legs were hurting the worst, I remember my hip joints felt like they?d buckle underneath me.  I got a headache that was unbearable.  It felt worse than a migraine.  It hurt to move my head or use my eyes at all.  I went to bed and was under several blankets and a heating pad while also running a space heater right next to me.  I still could not get warm at all.  I hallucinated that I could see each ache and pain on my body and watched them move through me.  By 4 am I was now hysterical and crying.  I was in so much unbearable pain and so scared.  I had to call off of work for this day.  I was so out of it I called my daughter off of school but also called for my mom to come get her and take her to school.  I kept my youngest home with me.  My head was still the absolute worst headache I have ever felt in my life.  I couldn?t open my eyes and it hurt to move at all.  I had to call a friend to come pick up my youngest daughter because I was unable to take care of her, I could barely stay awake and alert.  I tried another hot shower and everything still felt cold.  I was now nauseous from the head pain.  Around noon on this day I finally had the strength to drink some water and was able to take Tylenol.  I laid on the couch for hours still shivering and in unbearable pain.  I was still very scared that I was having such a bad reaction that I would die.  I called my husband to come home from work and be with me because I was scared.  I took more Tylenol a couple hours after the first dose.  Around 6 pm I started to feel better.  I was able to eat again that evening.  I had a headache though for about 3 weeks after that gradually weaned away.

                                                Starting around 8 pm began experiencing fatigue, Chills, and nausea. By 10 pm began having headache and went to lay down. Woke up in middle of the night with high fever, cold sweats, and migraine. By morning migraine intensified, could not stand for more than a few minutes without feeling faint and waves of nausea, complete loss of appetite and felt extremely dehydrated and lethargic. Sore arm at injection site started second day and progressively got worse day 3 and 4. 36 hours after vaccine was when I felt more able to eat, walk around, migraine reduced to a dull headache. Fatigue lingered in day to day activities for about 1 week.

I was in bed.  3/20?got period 3/21?I was gushing blood like never before in my entire life. I went through a menstral cup in 1.5 hours.    This excessive cycle lasted for days. My period is normally 3/4  days and this one was 6/7 days. I also passed 3 golf ball sized blood clots. I have never in my life passed a clot, let alone three that size.  The next cycle I had a tiny bit of break through bleeding the day I ovulated?that never happens. Then this cycled I have felt crampy and bloated. Like I am going to start my period at any minute but do not.  I am expecting my next period in less than a week. But this cycle has been completely abnormal and nothing changed but getting the shot two days prior to it starting.

Then, 3 days after receiving the vaccine, I suddenly began to have extreme stomach pain, so bad that I could barely walk or stand up straight. My chest felt tight and I had shortness of breath. I thought about going to the ER, but called my GI specialist instead as I thought it could be related to the Xifaxan I was taking, but the office was already closed. The GI office called the following Monday and said the Xifaxan should not cause extreme stomach pain and to go to the ER if it persists, but by this time I was feeling much better. The severe pain lasted two days in total.

Patient notified this PCP&#39;s office with these symptoms on 4/13/21 at 10:28 at which time patient was referred to the hospital ER due to  6 known cases of women who had received Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine and developed rare type of blood clots and patient&#39;s above symptoms to rule out deep vein thrombus. At the hospital ER provider did physical exam and ordered lab which confirmed patient had no deep vein thrombus. Patient was discharged home with diagnoses of left calf pain and dyspepsia. Patient continues to have abdominal intermittently but left calf pain has been resolved.

                                                Patient initially experienced muscle aches, fever, and headache for 3 days starting 1 day after vaccine -- within 3 days the muscle aches resolved, but then she continued to have severe headaches. The headaches became migraine like in quality with photosensitivity and a one-sided pounding that was debilitating and associated with nausea. The headaches respond to migraine treatment (Sumatriptan) started after the vaccine, but she has never had migraines before. The migraines continue almost every day until today, 4/27/2021. Due to the onset of new migraine-like headaches with no prior history, a workup and neurologic exam was done twice which was normal both times (see below). However, it seems significant that someone has new daily migraine headaches for longer than 3 weeks after the vaccine was given so we are reporting it.

                                                I was very ill on Friday night after receiving the vaccination. Flu-like symptoms, high fever, shortness of breath, pain in my abdomen, horrible headache, nausea, dizziness, loss of consciousness and leg pain (both legs). The flu-like symptoms passed on Saturday, but by Tuesday, April 13 I was continuing to have a terrible headache, abdominal pain and leg pain. I saw my primary doctor on the 13th and was sent over to the hospital for an ultrasound of my leg. No clots were found and I was told to continue trying to recover at home unless it got worse. I was seen at the emergency room on April 14th for abdominal pain, leg pain, dizziness and headache. The nurse told me I was probably hysterical over the vaccination being pulled, and I told him this was not the case. They performed CT (without contrast) on my abdomen and head, then released me with instructions to return if I was worse. By the 16th I was unable to walk as my left side was completely numb. I went back to the ER. I had a CT of my abdomen and head with and without contrast. I had a lumbar puncture and several labs. I was given IV antibiotics for some infection they found in my urine. I was given fluids and pain meds, and my BP was shooting up to 145/94 (which is very high for me), when standing. My vision was blurry and I was unable to remember much of the last week. I was admitted from the 16th through the 20th and had an MRV, 2 MRIs, more lab work and medicine for my headache. I was released on the 20th and the headache was unbearable and I was still numb on my left side, going back to my doctor on the 22nd. He suggested the ER, and the ER admitted me back to the stroke unit. I was released on the 22nd with a diagnosis of a hemiplegic migraine that could cause stroke-like symptoms (ZERO history of headaches previously). I was sent home with a walker and home health services. PT visited on April 30th and ordered two visits per week for the next month. I am unable to walk without a walker. I cannot shower or use the stairs without assistance. My memory is still foggy. I am unable to concentrate for long. I often stutter and can&#39;t remember basic words. I have also stopped and forgotten where I am at a given moment. I am on Depakote nightly for the headaches, and they have lessened slightly, but when they flare up it is debilitating and I often vomit. I have instructions to follow up with my primary tomorrow morning and see what the next steps are.

                                                Patient experienced sudden dizziness and nausea within 5 minutes of receiving Janssen COVID-19 immunization. Gave her water, crackers and cold/wet rags for her forehead as she felt hot. Took her temperature, returned normal. Gave her a trash can to keep near. Kept an eye on the patient and realized she was getting red in the face and more dizzy than she had been. Went out and stood next to patient, with her mom on her other side. Began to experience light sensitivity, feeling like the room was spinning. Patient almost fell out of the chair while sitting still. Mom used a personal pulse oximeter on patient, all results normal. Asked the patient about other symptoms, such as chest/abdominal/leg pain, headache, shortness of breath. Patient reported a headache, dizziness, nausea and leg numbness roughly 30 minutes following the vaccine. I recommended going to the ER, mom believed it would pass with time, but insisted she never responds this way to immunizations. Patient began to experience stabbing chest and abdominal pain around 45 minutes. Patient&#39;s mom was still hesitant to take her to the ER immediately on her own and asked us to call her PCP. He wanted the patient to go to the ER. Patient believed she would fall if she stood, offered to get a motorized cart, wheelchair or call an ambulance to transport her. Both patient and mom requested the ambulance. Asked a technician to check patient medications and allergies for EMTs, retook the patient&#39;s temperature which was normal again. Stayed with patient until EMTs arrived, reported all symptoms patient was experiencing.

                                                Starting at about 05:00 in morning, I woke up feeling shaky and chilly. I was very achy. I had a fever. I took my temperature and it was 102 fever. I took Tylenol. (Extra Strength) I went back to sleep. I woke up about 08:00 am and I still had chills and was extremely achy and had a really bad headache. My temperature was 101.8. Then I started throwing up every 20 minutes for the whole entire day. I still had a fever. It was 102.6 at one point. I had been taking extra strength Tylenol as often as I could take it. I still had a headache was very very achy. I was throwing up constantly and couldn&#39;t get out of bed. I had my husband come home to take care of toddler. That lasted then for a full 28 hours - through the next evening. When I woke up on April 7 I had a light headache, a little achy but fever was gone. At the time of my vaccine, I was just 8 weeks pregnant. I had an ultrasound when I was seven weeks along they could hear the heartbeat. I had a miscarriage around 8 weeks and four days. It would have been about one day after the vaccine when I was having my reaction to the vaccine. I am still having bleeding from the DMC - removal - but otherwise I&#39;m recovered.  Pregnancy history - It was my second pregnancy. Estimated due date - November 15, 2021.

At around 9:00 PM I had chills, migraine, bodyaches, burning sensation in my joints, neck pain, and a low-grade fever. I took some Tylenol at around 7 PM. But the pain did not subside and I was able to use the bathroom the next day at around 4 AM and was still in severe pain. That day at around 1 PM I was able to set up and felt 30% better. On day two I am feeling better but I still have minor body aches I do get fatigue while doing light work around the house and no appetite and loss of taste is the newest symptom. I am not 100 percent better but close to it.

Around 9:30pm that night I began to feel nauseous. As the night progressed my symptoms got worse. I experienced intense chills and by 11pm had a 100 degree fever. Sunday, March 7th my fever had decreased, but I continued to feel nauseous and have chills throughout the day. Additionally I felt extremely fatigued, weak, and had a throbbing headache. Completing simple tasks were difficult and exhausting. Monday, March 8th I continue to experience significant fatigue, headache, and muscle weakness, but at less intensity. Also, my right arm where I received the injection is very sore. I have also been somewhat dizzy today. I have been taking Advil, drinking fluids, using an ice pack, and resting as much as I can as part of the treatment.

                                                I had some sort of reaction to the vaccine about 1-2 minutes after receiving it, and it was super scary and they had to call the paramedics.   After the pharmacist injected me, I felt the arm pain right away. No big deal. I walked over to the chair to sit for my 15 minutes. I was happy to be vaccinated and kind of saw it as my mini booster for my immune system that already beat COVID-19. As I sat there, the only thing I could say is, I felt a tingling cold sensation moving from my arm through me. Almost like I could feel the vaccine moving through my system. The tingling kept moving and I thought to myself, okay cool. I guess it&#39;s working. Awesome. But then my head felt cold, I felt tingling in my head, my mouth tasted like metal, saliva started to build in my mouth, I started to sweat, I felt overly sweaty all over my body, but my head felt cold and tingly.   I was staring straight ahead and everything started to go staticky, like a television set, and the static began to build and started to get starry. Everything in my vision started to fade. So I spoke out to say something weird was happening.  A man came over to talk to me and hold me up. He kept saying stuff but then my ears started ringing and I couldn&#39;t hear him anymore. I began to fade out as the stars got more intense. Then, as if it was just a mini reboot, my brain started to come back online and the picture in front of me began to fade back into view. I felt nauseous and still had a super metal taste in my mouth. They called the paramedics to give me a checkup. The metal taste in my mouth stayed the longest, but after about 45 minutes I felt well enough to go home.  On and off, I have this intense tingling inside my brain. It reminds me of a time when I was in the hospital on morphine. Just a tingling pins and needles sensation inside my head. Other than that, I am okay now. But I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s some sort of reaction because I already had COVID-19.

When I woke up two hours later I was freezing cold and my body was very achy. I ended up sleeping the rest of the day and night. On Friday I felt fine most of the day until about 10pm at night when I started having diarrhea. Throughout the night it got worse and my body got very hot to the point where I had to sleep naked with fans on me. I?m lightly short of breath, exhausted, and am still having diarrhea now (Sat).

                                                About 25 minutes after receiving the shot, I suddenly felt weak and dizzy. My vision started to go dark. I broke out into a cold sweat all over my body and could barely see anything or move my body and I felt very nauseous. I was nearly unconscious and barely able to talk. This lasted for about 20 minutes and then slowly started to recede after that. I felt able to stand after about 40 minutes, and was eventually able to walk out of the store and be driven home.   I am very very healthy and have no major medical conditions.

                                                Within about 30 minutes of the shot I started to get the chills, feel nauseous, hard to focus, and very lethargic. Injection site was hot to the touch and did swell a bit. The following day I went through strong waves of feeling very ill and then feeling ok for about an hour, then back to having chills, nauseous, headache, body ache, and extremely lethargic. Half way through second day I broke out in a rash all over my chest, tummy, and back. Entering into day 3 ( today ) I do feel better, but can&#39;t shake the brain fog and feelings of being tired. Rash is still present currently.

                                                I got the J&amp;J vaccine at 9:31am on 4/4/21. At 4:30pm I began to feel lethargic and by 7:00pm I had chills so severe that a heating tower, 2 blankets and a comforter did nothing to warm me. I pulled muscles in my neck and back because I could not stop shivering. Around 9:30pm the shivering stopped and I became extremely overheated - I took tylenol every 4 hours (which was all I could take because I am breastfeeding) and my temperature still reached 103.8 and I threw up several times throughout the night. My fever broke around 4am. I have had stomach pain every day since then and do not know when it will stop or what to do about it.

                                                I received the J&amp;J one-dose vaccine on Thursday, April 8, at approx. 1600. Within an hour I had a mild headache and was nauseous. I went to sleep around 2130. At 0030 (or 30 minutes past midnight) I was awoken to the sudden shock of feeling very cold. My temperature was 91, within 15 minutes I spiked to 100 degrees, and then 15 minutes later I was at 102. I was shivering but felt like I was on fire. I had intense pain throughout my entire body. Internally and topically (skin) my entire body felt like it was on fire -- a burning sensation. Clothes -- even a soft hoodie -- felt like a steel wool scrubber was brushing against my skin and my skin was very hot to touch. I continued to feel nauseous.  After 90 minutes of this, I was able to take acetaminophen (2 x 500 mg). After another 90 minutes, my temperature dipped to 99 and the horrible pain mostly subsided.   From 0530 to 1830, in three-hour increments, my temperature continued to spike and fall between 99-101 degrees and the pain came in the same waves. Nausea continued. So, I continued an acetaminophen regimen throughout the day to help with the symptoms and took a few tums to help too.  After 1830, I felt very weak and tired. My temperature stabilized at normal. Nausea continued.   On Saturday, April 10, I was mostly just tired and had minor body aches/soreness. My shoulder bruised where I was vaccinated. Food did not sit well and my stomach was quick to turn.   Sunday, April 11, mostly back to normal. Although, still fatigued. No major side effects or symptoms.   Monday, April 12, seems to be the same as Sunday.   Note: I had COVID the first week of February 2021.

Back started to hurt and couldn&#39;t get comfortable. Then the whole body started to ache. Quickly the whole body and skin hurt and food and drink tasted bad. Started becoming cold and had to wrap a blanket around. Went to bed and had to take Tylenol every four hours to sleep. Woke up and body aches and feeling cold continued the rest of the day. There was also nausea and headaches on and of the whole day. Went back to work the following day but felt heavily nauseous for most of the day and couldn&#39;t eat or drink much of the day.

Almost 24 hours later I?m still experiencing cold chills. I also developed full body aches to where my bones feel like they are breaking and weak. Around 10 PM I started vomiting and that lasted for a couple of hours. At 2 AM a headache started and is still going on as of 9:46 AM. My bones pop and feel weak.  At other times my body will become extremely hot and soaked in sweat just to go back to cold chills.

                                                Became tired around 8pm, followed by chills, fever 101.8, sweats(taken around 12:30am), weakness, joint pain, and nausea. The fever and chills lasted around 5 hours. The following day I was weak in my hands and joints were sore.   I am a breastfeeding mom and my son broke out in a rash the following day. He was brought to the doctor. No data to show a correlation though.

I threw up three times at 10 pm and twice at midnight. I took 4 extra strength tylenol at 7 am the next day. Which broke my fever and lessened my headache. I woke up feeling fine the 13th.

Got very clammy and sweaty and weak - immediately left the store and started projectile vomiting outside the store and all night the first night. Had extremely joint/bone pain throughout my entire body for 4 days straight in bed, very weak, chills and night sweats, day 2 I had a little energy and drove about an hour and immediately started vomiting again  for day 2-day 5. Day 5 I woke up with swollen eye lids and hands and thought it was an allergic reaction to something in my house so took benedryl, but didn?t help. The swelling went down on day 6. I?ve had no energy and very foggy brain and been very down. My chest has felt like an anxiety attack 24/7 all week. I am on day 10 since the vaccination and my chest pain has increased. I still have foggy brain and been very out of it and weak still. I vomited day 1-day 5. Really bad pain in my hips and arm where I received the shot.

The reaction did not worsen. From a 1 to 10, ten being bad, the reaction was a 3. I had no difficulties breathing. The numbness went away after about 30 minutes.   The following day: chills, light fever 100.2F, stomach pain, loose stool, and fatigue.

At 9:40 PM that evening, I started feeling feverish, pain, itching at the injection site (continued for about 6 days); muscles aches (ongoing) headache, nausea, and uncontrollable chills. And I was not able to do anything the next day and that was the 11th. I l also got my period that day. The 12th, my period became a geyser - I never had a period like that before - I was bleeding a lot for about 5 days (my period didn&#39;t last longer than  a normal  period though) ; and I still had some muscle aches (they continued through the 12th). So I gave my PCP a call and went in, and she told me to watch it (she didn&#39;t know I had been vaccinated. I&#39;ve had an ongoing headache this week: on Wednesday (the 21st) - for 22 hours non-stop and Thursday (the 22nd I had another one on Thursday - it was about 6 or 7 hours).

                                                patient was treated with the Janssen/Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 adenovirus vaccine on Saturday April 10, 2021 and she relates having had symptomatic problems since that time stating prior to administration of the vaccine she was in her normal state of health.  She relates that on the evening of April 10 she had chills but otherwise no other major symptoms and the next day felt fine as well as during that week.  However she states that starting 1 week later on Saturday, April 17 she began feeling poorly characterized by a recurrence of hives that she has had in the past along with a sore throat.  She states this occurred while she was at work and describes the sore throat as unusual from prior sore throat she has had in the past with a description of a globus-like sensation along with some difficulties swallowing for more pressure than overt pain.  She attempted salt water gargles without benefit.  The rash was the characteristic hives rash that she has had on 2 prior occasions with rapid development of itchy red lesions scattered throughout especially in her proximal extremities and torso region.  She relates the hives worsened on Sunday, April 18 essentially from &#34;head to toe&#34; although not actually involving her face.  She also related new accompanying symptoms including diffuse arthralgias, stiffness and swollen painful muscles and joints.  This was throughout her entire body and somewhat of a migratory nature involving all of her major joints including the hands, wrists, shoulders, feet, ankles, knees and hips.  She states that because of the severity of symptoms she had an urgent care appointment on Sunday, April 18 and felt to have a exacerbation of urticaria for which she was prescribed montelukast, loratadine cimetidine and a Solu-Medrol Dosepak.  She states she was unable to fill the Solu-Medrol Dosepak initially but took the other medications without relief and then presented to the emergency room here at Hospital on Monday, April 19 where she had an evaluation which was largely unremarkable other than laboratory testing with a nonspecific elevation in inflammatory markers including a CRP of 5.7, ESR 34 and white blood count 15.92.  She was notably COVID-19 negative at that time as well as Monospot negative.  She was discharged home and ended up filling the Solu-Medrol Dosepak which she took and noted some improvement in her hives but has been continue to experience this ongoing sore throat, arthralgias, myalgias and diffuse swelling which is quite painful.  She specifically relates &#34;every time I use a muscle it seems to inflame.&#34;

                                                During my menstrual cycle I usually have no symptoms other than tender breasts. So these symptoms were very unusual. Leg pains, pain and pressure in pelvis, clitoral pain, pain around vaginal opening, stinging like acid during urination that sent a shock through my entire body, uncontrollable bladder, nausea, large blood clots, lower stomach pain, flank pain, hot/cold chills, if I touch my belly button the pain radiated to my vagina, ovaries hurt, cervix pain, dryness, unable to get comfortable, crawling out of my skin, and constant urge to urinate, depression.  I landed myself in the ER where they told me to take Tylenol and Motrin and sent me on my way. These medications were not able to control the amount of pain I was in. I have now reached out to a couple specialists.

                                                Patient reports mild symptoms after vaccination that went away after 2 days including nausea and vomiting. However, starting 04/28/21 patient began experiencing full body itching. The only recent change was immunization. Patient is unsure if vaccination is the cause of the itching but wanted to report just in case. Patient is without a primary care provider currently and went to an urgent care center after a sleepless night 04/30/21 due to itching. The urgent care prescribed something for the itching but patient didn&#39;t feel she was taken seriously with concerns about vaccination. Patient will try to follow up with previous primary care provider in the future.

The patient&#39;s weight and height were not reported. The patient medical history included being 4 months post-partum. The patient had no drug, food or other product allergies, and had no chronic or long-standing conditions. The patient received COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S (suspension for injection, route of administration and batch number not reported), dose was not reported, administered on 23-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported. From an unspecified date, the patient had 2 weeks of headaches and blurry vision, 2 to 3 days of neck stiffness and nausea with 1 episode of vomiting and had been transferred to the current hospital from another. On 04-APR-2021 (12 days post-vaccination), the patient was diagnosed with dural venous sinus thrombosis (DVST), transverse/sigmoid (cerebral venous) sinus thrombus (CVST) with associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe as well as thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein (thrombus). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) impressions showed there was a re-demonstrated of intraparenchymal hematoma in the right posterior temporal lobe measuring approximately 6.2 x 3.6 cm in maximal axial dimensions. There was surrounding edema and associated mass effect with effacement of the right temporal horn and right-to-left midline shift measuring 5 mm. There was medialization of the right uncus without transtentorial herniation. The basal cisterns were otherwise patent. There was dural thickening and hyperenhancement overlying the hemorrhage. There was prominent cortical veins along the right frontal temporoparietal convexity consistent with venous congestion. There was also a small are of vasogenic edema in the right anterior temporal lobe separate from the hematoma. There was a right mastoid effusion, but normal orbitals and the calvarium and skull base were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) results revealed non-opacification of the torcula, right transverse sinus, right sigmoid sinus and upper internal jugular vein compatible with occlusive thrombosis. A small amount of thrombus also extended into the left transverse sinus. The superior sagittal sinus, remainder of the left transverse sinus, left sigmoid sinus, left upper internal jugular vein, straight sinus, vein of Galen and bilateral internal cerebral veins demonstrated normal contrast opacification. The patient&#39;s platelet count was 126 upon admission (normal range [NR] not provided), with other workup laboratory test results reported as pending. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S was not applicable. The outcome of the right internal jugular thrombus, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, DVST, CVST, headache, blurry vision, neck stiffness, nausea and vomiting was reported as unknown. This report was serious (caused/prolonged hospitalization and other medically important condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This case concerns a 34-year-old white female who experienced cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), dural venous sinus thrombosis, right internal jugular vein thrombosis, and cerebral hemorrhage 12 days after receiving covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s for prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The patient was noted to be 4 months post-partum. She presented for medical assistance with a 2-week history of headaches, blurry vision, and neck stiffness for 2 to 3 days as well as nausea with 1 episode of vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large hematoma in the right posterior temporal lobe with surrounding edema and associated mass effect resulting in effacement of the right temporal horn and right-to-left midline shift measuring 5 mm and occlusive thrombus within the torcula, right transverse sinus, right sigmoid sinus, and upper internal jugular vein.  A small amount of thrombus extended into the medial aspect of the left transverse sinus. The platelet count on admission was 126,000. Although the post-partum status of the patient may have contributed, based on evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS, per definition from Brighton Collaboration) and considering the low platelet count and temporal relationship to vaccination, we consider the events to have a plausible relationship with vaccination.

Heartburn faded (did try taking Tums, with little effect), changed back to mainly stomach pain.  Stomach pain daily 4/19 - 4/29, mainly occurring (1) before &amp; after breakfast, (2) late afternoon, (3) evening. Began taking Prilosec (omeprazole) on 4/30; stomach pain similar to previously described 4/30 - 5/1. Symptoms became more intense, heartburn and heart pain on 5/2, stomach pain 5/3, heartburn and heart pain 5/4. Stopped Prilosec 5/5, symptoms receded to mild heartburn and stomach pain 5/5 - 5/6.  Currently deciding next steps for treatment. Stomach pain can be soreness, occasional twinges, all located just below left ribcage.  Heartburn upper left, feels warm but also sore (kind of like someone punched me there).

The first week was basically fever, loss of appetitie and lack of energy.  By week 2 I started having headaches so I went to the healthcare facility and was prescibed Naprozen but it has been ongoing since.  I was diagnosed with a URI and was prescribed Mucinex which did help with the flim that I begin coughing up.  I have been struggling with my appetite and has noticed about a 5lb weight loss.  It is getting better but still not fully back to normal yet.

                                                After getting it I went home and slept about 3 hours and woke up with fever of 99.3. Had a pounding headache that Tylenol nor ibuprofen could relieve. Body began to ache to the point I was in tears. Checked fever again and was at 99.9. Took more Tylenol and Ibuprophen and went to bed as much as I could. Woke up and took Tylenol the next morning. Checked temperature because I still had a pounding headache and was at 100.2, started sweating and shaking as in cold sweats. No appetite. Spent most of the day resting with most symptoms still accruing. On 3rd day I have no fever. I?m not as weak and I?m able to get around a lot better. Still a little nauseous but definitely feeling better then the previous days.

                                                About 6 hours after injection, I felt incredibly exhausted. After 12 hours, nausea and headache set in. 13-14 hours, a terrible stomachache and diarrhea. My skin felt so sensitive that it hurt to touch. Zofran treated the nausea. The day after the injection I was exhausted, was nauseous and had a headache. 48 hours after injection I woke up with a strange headache. I could look to the right pain free, but if I looked to the left or left/up, I had a piercing pain near my right eye. Excedrin/Tylenol did not relieve this headache. On Hour 72, the headache is still present, though to a lesser degree.

I had seasonal allergies occurring that day, so I kept eating a bit longer. My tongue then started tingling. I took a dose of Children&#39;s Benadryl (all I had for Benadryl at the time). I then waited about 10 minutes before I felt my throat starting to close. We headed straight to emergency room (5 mins away). By the time I got there, I started to have a little trouble taking breaths. When I got into the trauma room moments later, I became nauseous and dry heaving.  They gave me an epinephrine shot, Benadryl, Pepto, and Prednisone.   They watched me for a few hours before release. Upon discharge, they provided me a prescription for epi-pens, famotidine, prednisone, and fexofenadine (5-day prescriptions).

By 5pm my temperature was at 99 degrees F and by 7pm, my temperature was 100 degrees F. My muscles on my back, neck and legs were painful. I had no problems drinking liquids. I refrained from Tylenol until about 7pm, I had 1000mg. I slept for 8 hours and woke up with no fever but the muscle aches have reduced by about 50%.

                                                starting at 11:00 PM day of vaccine, I started to feel nauseous, chills, aches all over, extreme exhaustion / tired, and headache. The symptoms worsened through the night, unable to sleep. Sometimes the chills would turn to fever and extreme sweating and burning hot sensations. The symptoms were the worst on Thursday and lessened slightly with each passing day. The illness stayed until Sunday morning.

First day after felt slightly better, still tired and slightly light headed. Second day symptoms worsened, feeling like I was going to pass out/faint, hot/cold chills, clammy, no fever, shortness of breath, culminating in numbness and tingling in arms, legs, then chest and then hands freezing up which resulted in a panic attack. Have never had a panic attack before. Emergency services called and after checking gave a sedative and went to the ER.

Felt a little nauseous immediately after shot. Flu symptoms came on around 10pm and lasted until about 5pm on 3/21/2021. Worst period of symptoms was overnight (about 12 hours.) Took 2 Tylenol 2-3 times while I was experiencing side effects which helped some with symptoms.  Had pain with injection and sore arm for about 48 hours after. It was a much more severe, deeper muscle pain than with other vaccines.

Immediately after she had a syncopal episode and was unresponsive for about 1 minute. We immediately called 911, lay her flat and raised her legs. She became responsive and was alert and oriented X  3. We were unable to get a BP reading but her color was improving and she remained alert. We repositioned her in a supine position and she had another syncopal episode. We raised her legs again and she improved immediately. EMS arrived shortly after. She remained alert and responsive  and was evaluated for about an hour and released to her spouse. She didn&#39;t want to be evaluated at the hospital. She made record of having a similar episode during a procedure at her doctor&#39;s office.

                                                I woke up 12 hours after I got the vaccine with dizziness, nausea, chills, and joint pain. The dizziness got progressively worse (so much so I had to call into work) with the worst dizziness peaked about 18 hours post vaccine. All symptoms resolved within 36 hours post vaccine. The dizziness felt different than my chronic migraine dizziness. I was more disoriented and it was difficult to stand or walk long distances. I had to lay flat most of the day until symptoms resolved.

My hips and lower back muscles cramped so quickly I couldnt walk.  Severe headache with eye pain, light sensitivity and nausea.  I woke up early the next day to severe nausea and vomiting, migraine, muscle and joint pain.  My fever was normal by 4pm, but migraine, muscle and joint pain and nausea still bad. I could not leave bed for entire day.

                                                After receiving the vaccine I went and sat in a chair for the 15 minutes following the vaccine. Approximately 4-5 minutes later I started feeling really hot. Then I started getting nauseous and dizzy. I tried to get up and walk to the pharmacy desk (vaccine occurred at pharmacy) but fainted midway there. I was out less than one minute and after sitting down and having some water and putting ice packs on my face I felt better. I have never in my life fainted before. I wasn?t nervous or scared to have the vaccine.   I followed up with my regular doctor on the Monday following the vaccine and had an EKG and bloodwork done all of which came back normal.

Heating pad and blankets until vomiting and diarrhea started around 6pm. This continued many times throughout the night until about 8am the next morning  when I finally self medicated with Zofran to try to stop the dry heaving. I took 3 doses of zofran throughout the day to keep from vomiting more. Diarrhea slowly subsided throughout the day. I slept for 2 days straight afterwards.

                                                One day after my vaccine, I started spotting and by 2 days my period was the heaviest bleeding I have ever had for 4 days going through a tampon more frequently than ever hour as well as additional amount on overnight pad. My perioid has been every 21 days regular and I had just finished my period on 3/30 so I was not due. Of note, 8 hours after vaccine I had fever, sweats, headache and nausea with muscle aches which resolved (except muscle aches) within 24 hours

Through CT scan with contrast, the doctor determined it was diverticulitis and treated with antibiotics. I am still recovering, no history of diverticulitis, and unknown if this is an adverse effect.

I fell asleep at approx 1pm and woke up around 4pm with less cramping and a dull headache. The headache continued throughout the evening. I had diarrhea on and off. Each time I stood up I felt faint and lethargic, leading me to spend the rest of the night in bed. Today, my body feels sore and lethargic and my mind feels foggy and tired.

                                                I received the vaccine on day 5 of my period.  I take no hormones of any kind and my periods are regularly 5-7 days in length. My period began on 4/6. Instead of beginning to wane, my period started to get extremely heavy and I started passing clots again about 24hr after the injection. On the night of 4/12 I passed an unusually large clot, roughly the size of a hockey puck and felt very faint and weak. I continued to bleed quite heavily until this morning (4/19), for a total of 14 days. I called my obgyn on Tuesday of last week to report the excessive bleeding and that my cervical lymph nodes had become so swollen that it was bothersome to swallow. My Dr said to go to ER if I experienced typical blood clot/PE symptoms and had received no guidance about the effects of this vaccine on menstruation.  I have had mild headaches, sore throat, mild fevers and fatigue as well since the injection

                                                Within about 2 hours, I felt really tired. A couple hours later I got body aches and tingling sensation on the left leg.  That night it got worse, hurt and some numbness. The following day I had abdominal pain and still had leg symptoms. On Saturday I needed up going to Urgent Care .  They did a Urine test, that was negative, but did see traces of blood but she wasn&#39;t concerned and did I send it our for a culture test. She sis an exam and a little concern because she wasn&#39;t aware of the side effects and ordered an ultra sound. She told me to take Tylenol and sent me home. I was still experiencing all everything the next day and developed a headache. The Urgent care Dr had called me the next day asked me to go in and get the Ultra sound.  They didn&#39;t find anything. I did have another ultra sound scheduled and had it done, I got the results and it was fine. She thinks the vaccine effected my nerves.  I also seen my Primary Physician because I had a fever as well, she did an exam and ordered Blood work and CT scan (abdomen). Everything came back normal.  My OCO believes it&#39;s my nerves as well. I believe it effected my mensural   cycle as well because it&#39;s earlier and heavier.

I had body wide aches in my joints, muscle soreness in my whole body, intense fatigue, and a loss of appetite. I could not work that day. I took Advil and went to sleep for several hours. The next morning, however, I felt much better. The muscle soreness was still there, but greatly reduced-. Advil enabled me to work that next day - March 16th, 2021.

On the third day i started to feel itchy and was super red. On Monday morning, I woke up with the rash all over my body and feeling very dizzy. I went to urgent care and he checked me that I had an allergic reaction to the J&amp;J vaccine. I also experienced vaginal bleeding, uncontrollably and he did the exams and I was told it was my menstrual cycle which lasted one week.  I have not gotten my menstrual cycle since the J&amp;J vaccine.  I do not have my lot # at the moment.

Had to let it run its course.  Headache throughout day, took excederin first time then Tylenol later in day when headache wasn?t as severe.  Fatigue- up with fever and chills in night probably contributed.  Took a 2 hr nap plus went to bed early.

I used my best judgement and still give her the shot. 2minutes not related to the vaccine in my opinion but patient threw up and was dizziness. water was offered and 911 was called as a precaution. Shortly after dispatcher arrived she was actually fine and no further action was necessary.

Woke up around 9:30pm with flu like symptoms, lethargic and didn&#39;t feel like I was able to move, but was not comfortable laying in bed. Got chilly shortly after waking up around 9:30 pm. Was able to feel warm with a hoodie, sweatpants, thick socks, and a blanket on.  Was not hungry but felt like eating was not a good idea. I didn&#39;t feel like I had the energy to eat. I was drinking water as I felt it was necessary. I went back to bed around 11:30pm and woke up the next morning feeling fine. My arm was sore for 2 days, afterwards, ached near the injection site, and when I used the upper arm muscles to move my arm. I&#39;m not sure after that because I was taking ibuprofen and Tylenol for cramps.

Roughly 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine, she started to feel nauseous, develop crampy abdominal pain, and feel lightheaded. She went home and took a shower and lay down in bed. When she got up she again felt nauseous and dizzy. She threw up a total of 6 times, none of which were bloody. She had several episodes of diarrhea throughout the day. Given her ongoing symptoms she presented to the ED.   On arrival, she was febrile to 39.5C, and tachycardic to 145 with BP 98/56 and SpO2 100% on room air. She was given zofran, 1L NS, and tylenol. On repeat, her BP was 75/35 (though no longer tachycardic). She was written for 2 more liters of NS and then endorsed to medicine. Her BP improved w/ SBP in the 90s-110s with continued myalgias, headaches.

                                                The night of 3/9/21  following the vaccination I had fever, chills, sweating, severe body aches and pains (all over) and nightmares Wednesday morning I was unable to go to work and remained in bed sleeping all but approximately 2 hours in the afternoon  because I was still in pain and had headache/fever/chills/muscle and joint pain. I also had no appetite. I was awake long enough to eat one bowl of cereal and a small apple sauce cup so that I could take more meds without upsetting my stomach. Wednesday night 3/10 my temperature was still at 99.3. I was still having body soreness and headaches (sinus). Thursday morning 3/11 I still had the headache and body soreness but no more fever. I was still feeling unwell but could at least get out of bed and function. By late Thursday most of the symptoms subsided and I started feeling better. Friday morning I was no longer having symptoms.  It was the initial symptoms Tuesday night and Wednesday that concerned me the most because it hit me so severely and fast. The pharmacist warned me of possible side effects that would require over the counter medication, but in my case that did not suffice. I was physically unable to do anything but sleep which is highly unusual for me, and my entire body was in more pain than I?ve ever experienced.

Following that I had a headache, nausea, flu like symptoms, body aches, and a fever. Missed 2 days of work. My symptoms from the vaccine were worse than when I had the COVID virus.

                                                First I felt lightheaded/dizzy, then became nauseous, and my feet and hands were numb and tingling, I felt like my tongue was getting bigger but the primary care dr at the clinic didn&#39;t think so. They eventually after monitoring me for awhile sent me down to ER, by then my voice was raspy and scratchy, my lower lip was big, my tongue still felt big. I still felt nauseous. The dr asked me if my eyes are usually swollen and red and I said no. My extremities were still numb and tingling. I got epi and other drugs, zofran, benadryl, pepcid, I think a dose of steroids. The symptoms continued so I ended up getting a 2nd dose of epi. I went home around 5pm. When I woke up that evening to do a neb treatment I was nauseous, my lower lip again big, my tongue felt thick and this time my upper throat felt swollen, I gave myself epi and took myself to ER, they monitored me for 3 hrs the dr was gonna hospitalize me if I got worse, I still felt nauseous and the numbness and tingling feeling in my hands and feet when I left but was not having any airway issues when I left. Not sure if the numbness/tingly is gonna go away in my hands and feet.

This rapidly turned into skin tingling, violent shivers and shaking throughout the body followed by burning hot fever. Once this passed, at about 2:00am, nausea began and mild vomiting. After that, exhaustion set in and loss of appetite. The exhaustion and lack of appetite lasted until about 8pm on Saturday - about 28 hours post-vaccine. However, vomiting occurred again at midnight that night as well about 34 hours post-vaccine.

                                                started with drowsiness and no appetite, chills came on but nothing serious but within 1 hour the chills became very intense and I couldnt  warm up or take it. I had sweatpants, two sweatshirts, slippers and 2 blankets on to help. Later on I had fallen asleep to wake my husband to uncontrollable laughter and crying, mentally I knew what I was doing was not right but I couldn&#39;t control it. I believe my feve may had spiked so high that it was border line hysteria. By morning I woke and the fever had broke however I still had no appetite, terrible headache along with weakness and fatigue....I also tried food but ended up spitting it out because everything tasted strongly of metal. Sunday I was back to tasting to food and more energy.

By 6:30pm, I was down for the count with the cold sweats, diarrhea, headache and vertigo like symptoms (dizzy when standing or moving). Tylenol was taken for fever and water and Gatorade is all that was drank for the remainder of the night. When awaking around 8am the next morning,  fever was gone as well as chills. headache and dizziness remained. Around 1pm, toast and oatmeal was eaten and started feeling more normal again. by 5pm was fine, just tired and sore still.

Saturday I felt achy and a little unsteady when I got up or walked around (these reactions I expected). Sunday morning I woke up covered head to toe in hives that lasted for three days. I have never had hives so bad before. I called the pharmacy and was instructed to take Benedryl which didn&#39;t work. I took Allegra on Tuesday which seemed to help clear them up by the end of the day.

Prior to going to bed at midnight, I started to experience slight stomach pain. At 2am in the morning (4/11) after receiving the shot I started vomiting and had diarrhea which lasted for about one hour. After returning to bed I had severe chills.   I ate the same foods throughout the day as 3 other adults and 1 child and none experienced similar symptoms.

Approximately 5-6 hours later I began experiencing chills, muscle and joint aches, nausea diarrhea, headache and a continuous fever of 104.0 f that eventually broke with 500mg of Tylenol, however fever / symptoms persist even today 15 hours later.

                                                36 y.o. female referred for the above chief complaint.   She has no significant medical history and presented with a headache that became severe 3 days ago.  She received the Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine on March 25th and had a mild headache following that which she attributed to the vaccine.  3 days ago the pain became excruciating and was associated with vomiting.  This prompted presentation to the ED where she was treated with Dilaudid. She was discharged home and has been using her mom&#39;s headache cocktail with some transient relief.  She presented back to the ED today with continued symptoms.  MRV revealed a venous sinus thrombosis and neurology was therefore consulted.   She has no history of clots personally or in the family.  Her dad did have a stroke in his 50s.  Patient otherwise denies any other associated speech change, vision change, extremity numbness, extremity weakness, coordination difficulty, or dizziness. Patient admitted to the neurology ICU and started on anticoagulation.

Joint soreness and pain (especially knees &amp; wrists). Temp of 101.1 for at least 1&#43; hour by the time we checked prior to bed. A few very strong waves of nausea during fever spell, but that has gone away this morning.

                                                On Thursday, April 8, 2021, between 915 and 945 AM, I received the Janssen/Johnson &amp; Johnson single dose COVID-19 Vaccine. As I have had adverse reactions to vaccines in the past, I was advised to wait at the vaccination site for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, and I did. Approximately 2 hours after receiving the vaccine in my left arm, I developed a red lacey-type rash all over my body. (This rash still persists today, Tuesday, April 13, 2021 at 3:37 PM and is relieved temporarily with consistent doses of Benadryl capsules, liquid or tablets.)  On Thursday night (April 8), after receiving the vaccine, I began to have body aches and to feel fatigued around 7:30 PM. I took 50 mg Benadryl, 500 mg acetaminophen, 800mg ibuprofen and went to bed. I woke around 12:30 AM and was drenched in sweat and my clothes were wet with sweat. I urinated and went back to bed and was shivering uncontrollably from the time I got out of bed until I got back in the bed and bundled up?it was several minutes before the shivering stopped and I went back to sleep. At approximately 2 AM, I woke up to urinate again. I had a terrible headache, like my head was in a vice; my tongue, throat, and nasal passages were very swollen, and it was difficult to breathe through my nose at all. I took an additional 50 mg of Benadryl and a 500mg acetaminophen and went back to bed. On Friday morning I woke to a phone call from work checking on me. I had slept through all of my alarms and it was 8:35 AM. I was unable to report to work that day and went back to sleep and slept for most of the day, only getting up occasionally to get a drink and use the bathroom. That evening I was able to get up and do a few things with the children and run to the grocery store, however, I became very fatigued and went to bed early without eating dinner.  On Saturday morning, when I woke up, I realized that I had slept for over 12 hours. I was groggy and fatigued all day and had a nap in the afternoon. That evening I was able to participate in family movie night and was feeling ok until about 10 PM. At that time, I began to feel very nauseated and had diarrhea, even though I had not eaten anything that would upset my stomach. I had intense abdominal cramping and felt like I would vomit if I moved around too much. I went to bed and had to get up to use the bathroom with diarrhea at least twice after the initial symptoms at about 10 PM.  On Sunday morning, I woke up after sleeping approximately 10 hours and was able to get up without feeling too fatigued. I did chores and errands and began to feel fatigued in the afternoon and took a nap for about 2 hours. That evening I also had to rush to the bathroom with diarrhea, however, there was no nausea. I went to bed at about 10 PM. On Monday morning, when I woke up, I felt very groggy and did not feel like I had gotten enough sleep. By the evening on Monday, however, I had begun to feel a little less fatigued and more clear-headed. As of Tuesday, April 13, 2021, I have had the red lacey-looking rash intermittently since having the vaccine. I am already on several OTC allergy medications for seasonal allergies and continue to take those medications, however, I have increased my Benadryl intake from 25 mg in the morning to 50 mg in the mornings with 25 -50 mg every 6 hours or so, as well. The rash improves for a short time while I am taking the Benadryl, but it reappears within a few hours after taking the Benadryl.

                                                Once my vaccine was administered I felt tingling on my tongue and bottom lip. I waited the 15 minutes and felt that the tingling was diminishing. I spoke to the tech and felt ok to leave since I was not experiencing loss of breath or swelling. After about 3 hours I noticed the tingling sensation coming back. I immediately called the pharmacist who administered the shot. After explaining the tingling was mostly felt on my lips and tongue but had no swelling and could breath and swallow just fine. I explained that it felt like when you get a shot for Dental work and that every time I touched the area it would tingle more. He told me that was not a normal reaction and would call in a few hours to check in on me. Sometime around 7 we spoke again and I still had no changes with the tingling. Again, he said he would have the pharmacist who was in call again the next day to make sure I was ok. By 11:30pm the aches in my joints started and I had chills. I woke up for work at 3:25am and noticed the tingling sensation wasn&#39;t as strong as the day before. Once I ate the tingling became more noticeable and was mostly on the right side of my tongue and throat. I also started experiencing a headache and sinus pressure. After arriving I work by 6am I felt exhausted. As the day went on the exhaustion  was becoming so strong I felt that I was fighting to keep my eyes open. The aches in my joints were becoming more intense especially in my hips and hands. At times I felt it hard to hold anything in my hand as closing my fingers became so painful it brought tears to my eyes. I also notice I was sweating profusely but had no fever. Once I was home I took a 2 hour nap. I woke up feeling the same the tingling in my mouth, aches still noticeable and headache still there. I could not stand and even tried to eat but had a loss of appetite. I called the pharmacy and reported the tingling was still noticeable. The pharmacist on duty explained the aches were normal but the tingling was not. I was advised to seek medical attention if I had trouble breathing or had swelling. The pharmacist told me to keep up on rest and fluids and I would recieve another call tomorrow to see how I was feeling. It&#39;s now 9:28pm and there are no changes to the tingling sensation in my mouth/throat. I still have aches and pains that are radiating throughout my body. My headache is still there but not as strong as this morning and I now have ringing in my ears. Every once in awhile I get some good stomach pains but they last a minute or two before going away.

                                                Felt fine at time of shot, a little achy afterwards but nothing concerning. My legs ached some a few days after but got better. About 3 days ago I started getting a major headache on the right side that also arrived with blurry vision, mental fog and mild dizziness. Nausea yesterday and today except the headache was much worse. I cried from the pain and this is when I became more concerned. My eyes, mainly the right side and a pressure in my sinuses were very difficult to bare with, subsided some with multiple doses of ibuprofen and Advil sinus but not by much. The headache is unbearable, painful to stand out bend over or move.

                                                I did not receive treatment other than a prescription for a headaches.  I ended up having a bad headache after my J&amp;J vaccine. My headache developed at the base of my skull and radiated to the top of my neck. I had another headache above my eye as well. I also had  intense joint pain from my upper leg all the way to my right ankle.  I also experienced nausea along with my headache.  An  ultrasound of the right groin was performed to check any clots in my right leg. The doctor who saw me prescribed Emetrex for the headaches and there has been no follow up since then.  I still have a headache today but is a lot less in intensity.

                                                I got the shot Saturday afternoon. My side effects started around 9:30 with chills?I just couldn?t get warm. I drifted off to sleep all right around 10:30, but by midnight, my legs were on fire like I?d just run a marathon. I?m pretty sure I had a fever because I was sweating and tossing and turning for what seemed like hours. By 4:00, I had a massive headache and felt like I was going to throw up. I took Advil and Zofran at 4 and went back to bed. Sunday I still battled headache, aches, and fatigue. The fatigue is what&#39;s still lingering yesterday and today.

                                                Symptoms began later in the same day the vaccine was received. Fever was between 100-102 for about 48 hours from symptom onset, and had significant joint pain in all joints, but especially knees. Major fatigue but unable to sleep because of intensity and discomfort of symptoms. Outbreak of new aphthous ulcers in mouth. Contacted physician to ask if I could take acetaminophen or ibuprofen to lower fever and get relief from joint pain - was advised both were safe to use. Took acetaminophen. Major symptoms resolved after 48 hours, but some general fatigue, loss of appetite, and night sweats continued for approximately 1 week post-vaccine.

The red spot  has grown to the size of 5 inches  in diameter. Slight nausea the first day of injection. Along with genera malaise.

I put an ice pack on my head because it feels swollen and there?s a lot of pressure that it?s painful. This morning I tried to eat crackers so I could take ibuprofen but I threw up immediately. I?m currently still experiencing a lot of head pain/ache and nausea and muscle tightness.

                                                I went to a community event (held at a church) for the COVID vaccine. After the vaccine, I wanted the 15 minutes and felt ok - just hot. I went out to my car and over the next few minutes - I was getting hotter - My face was extremely hot and flushed, and hives started developing on my arms and chest. They were burning and itching; my skin was hot to the touch. My chest felt tight and my throat felt swollen, but I was able to breathe (breathe felt a little short, but I was able to take a full breathe). I was also dizzy and felt nauseous. I went to the ER, where they treated me for anaphylaxis with Benadryl, Pepcid, Breathing treatment, and a steroid. After about an hour or so I felt fine, and the dr gave me some medications to take over the next few days.

My arm was immediately tingly and numb simultaneously, and I felt...light and weird. Around 2p, I began feeling feeling lightheaded and weak, and at 6p, I had chills, severe weakness, dizziness and nausea. I couldn&#39;t stand up longer than 2 minutes without wanting to vomit and faint. I couldn&#39;t even stand up long enough to wash dishes, prepare a bowl of grapes to eat or shower. Throughout the night, I sweated so terribly from the chills to the point that my bed was soaked to the mattress pad, and currently at 2:02p on April 6th, I&#39;m still experiencing the extreme weakness, nausea, and chills.

                                                Approximately 9 hours after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA, I experienced sudden fatigue followed by onset of severe muscle and joint pain including severe head pain followed by severe chills followed by fever and excessive sweating. I was very dizzy and felt disoriented. I was in bed when all this happened and was already wearing warm clothes under the covers. The muscle and joint pain was so severe, I couldn&#39;t grip anything including my cell phone (my wrists were in sharp pain). The head pain was so severe I was sensitive to light regardless of how dim it was. I felt like my toes were curled, but that could have been me &#34;bracing&#34; and tightening up due to the total body pain. I could move very little. It was very strange. These symptoms persisted through the night. The following morning at around 9am, I still had a very bad headache that made me nauseated and continued to be sensitive to light. Some of the joint and muscle pain tapered down enough for me to get out of bed to go potty but it was exhausting to walk 5 feet to the bathroom and then get back in bed. I still ran a mild fever. At around 1pm I took a Tylenol that helped subside the symptoms but felt wiped out all day. By the following day (Monday), I was feeling better getting more energy and by that Monday evening, I felt like nothing ever happened. I&#39;m sure these just fall into perhaps the more severe level of the side effects, but I was frightened by the intense sharp muscle and joint pain to the point I couldn&#39;t even grip anything.

I got home and had the worst headache I&#39;ve ever had and felt flu like symptoms and very weak. The next day at work I was so sick I had to go home. I was puking and had diarrhea  over and over for a few hours. I also felt lightheaded and dizzy and weak. Also had the headache. I was getting chills as well once I got home.

By morning of the 9th, all effects ceased.

I felt a little nauseous, and my gut was upset. I had chills, fever, and then began to have painful muscle aches on my backside. My sleep was significantly disrupted - I woke up at midnight two nights in a row after my fever broke, then had disrupted sleep the whole rest of the night, waking up at least once an hour, the second night in significant pain from muscle aches. I didn&#39;t feel well enough to get out of bed for about 40 hours, would get chills if I got up for more than a couple minutes. I began to feel better second morning after symptoms began, took two Tylenol, then improved  rapidly  with no further side effects.

                                                The day after receiving the shot I had a headache that escalated to the worst headache I have ever had and soreness kicked in abo this day next day while body sore  felt nauseated that increased I could barely move without feeling like I?d throw up whixh I eventually did I say on the bathroom floor for hours I couldn?t eat or drink I had ice the course of a few hours three pedialyte pops eventually I didn?t want to move. Because it would make me more nauseated.  Terrible headache I fell asleep earlier in the afternoon I had to hold my Stomach and even turning in bed led to more nausea.  Finally fell asleep  dor the night woke up so far today I don?t feel nauseated I do feel dehydrated and I tried to drink Gatorade but drinking  from a cup aggravates it so only like ice chips or popsicles don?t aggravate my stomach    I felt like I was dying just laying on the floor for hours I laid on the. Ahg room floor because the tile was cool and I was near the toilet.  I tested positive for covid asymptomatic in October and then positive again in December with mild symptoms.  I never fully regained sense of smell or taste only partially even though that was months ago.  I wouldn?t wish that vaccine reaction in anyone   I was hesitant sins with already had covid to get vaccinated but was encouraged to do so.  I definitely won?t do that again ever.  It wasn?t that bad actually having COVID that was way worse.

                                                Later in the evening after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine, I developed a 103 degree fever, severe chills, headache, fatigue, and mild nausea/upset stomach.  I tried to hold off for a bit from taking any pain relievers, but did take tylenol about halfway through the night which helped quite a bit. The next day I only had a low grade fever, fatigue and minor stomach upset. I also had some arm pain starting that evening post vaccination and it lasted for about 5 days. I felt mostly fine though within a couple days. I am one week post vaccination and currently feel pretty good. I have been sleeping heavier/more this week but I&#39;m not sure whether it&#39;s related or not.

About 2 minutes later he vomited, and then vomited again about 10 minutes later. He was conscious the entire time and could see me and speak to me coherently. She was sweating profusely. We provided an ice pack and called 911. EMS arrived and took his vitals, which  they said were perfectly normal. The patient refused to go to the hospital and hung around the pharmacy for another 10 minutes before leaving, saying he felt much better.

At 6:30pm I began to have uterine/abdominal cramping, vaginal pain, lower back pain. At 7:30 I began to feel extremely overheated and a little fatigued. At 9:00pm I felt chills, extreme fatigue, all over body ache and joint pain. At about 2:00 am overnight I again felt extremely overheated. The following morning I continued to feel fatigue, abnormal temperature swings, body ache and joint pain. This lasted until night (about 30/36 hours after the injection). About 48 hours after the injection, I felt some dizziness and abdominal upset.

                                                After I got the vaccine my heart rate went over 100 and I had to lay down at the hospital to recover because I was so dizzy. On Saturday night and Sunday I felt some normal side effects like a severe headache, chills, nausea, and fatigue. Monday I felt better than normal and I thought I was in the all clear. Today (Tuesday) I woke up feeling like I had a stroke. I can still lift both arms and both sides of my face, but I can not think and feel like I am dying. I am scared to go to the hospital. I am unable to work. I feel incredibly emotional and unable to think. I feel so tired and the pain at the injection site is now even worse. I am getting chest pains, dizzy spells, really bad headache, and it feel like I am in a dream state unable to do things I normally can do. I am not okay and really regret getting the vaccine. I had no prior health concerns and probably would have survived covid, but it feels like I may never get my mental functioning back again.

                                                On 4/30/2021 I recieved the Covid-19 vaccine and on 5/1/2021 I started with upper abdominal pain and nauesa. It went away and came back on 5/3/2021, went away and came back on 5/5/2021 with the pain and nausea intensifying. I went to ER on 5/6/2021 at 1 am. When I arrived to the ER they proceeded to do bloodwork, also ordered an x-ray to ensure that my lungs were not causing an issue due to where pain was located. After the labs came back they saw my liver numbers were extremely high, so then they ordered a CT scan with contrast. CT scan showed everything to be normal. They then determined I needed to be admitted due to believing I had a stone in my bile duct, Gallbladder was removed in 2019. The MRI was done at 7pm on 5/6/2021. The results were recieved on 5/7/2021 and showed my bile duct was clear of obstructions. They continued to monitor my liver numbers and I was released today 5/9/2021 due to my numbers continually decreasing with instructions to follow-up with my PCP to have labs run again to ensure my numbers remained on decline to the normal range. I was also instructed to do the adverse event reports as to them not having enough data to determine if the vaccine may have been the reason for my high numbers. My PCP had just had my yearly labs done on 3/16/2021 and my liver numbers were normal.

                                                Immediately began to feel a headache, dizzy and nauseated.  The doctor on site had me lie down on the floor. Was starting to feel better so was able to sit up in a chair for about 15 minutes. Another wave of dizziness and nausea came over and was lying on the floor again. It was hard to breathe, but oxygen and HR were good. The doctor tried to give me juice to see if it was my blood sugar going low, but afterward, I still felt dizzy and nauseated. It was still hard to breathe. It felt like something was sitting on my chest. BP was elevated, oxygen levels were good, HR was good but I started to get a cold chill where my teeth were chattering. At that point (about 45 min to an hour) the symptoms had not gone away and the ambulance was called. Was transported to the local hospital where I received a liter of saline and Zofran for nausea.  BP was high, but oxygen levels and HR were good. The heart monitor showed no signs of arrhythmia or tachycardia so I was discharged. The doctor believes it was a side effect and not an allergic reaction.

I fainted at table, then my spouse didn&#39;t know when he came downstairs, he thought my head was just resting at the table. He asked if I wanted to walk to the couch to rest, and as he helped me do so, I fainted and he caught me and carried me to the couch. Recovered within 1 minute but my hearing was  fuzzy for a couple more minutes, sounded like static in my ears.  Other reactions were:  Standard ones I read could happen- Fever of 100.1 that lasted less than a day, chills, aches, warm feeling and fatigue.

Chills, fever which reached 104 by midnight, racing heartbeat which lead to increased palpitations, slight dizziness, body aches all over.  I was unable to fall asleep until 2:30am.   The following day, chills and fever continued, though lower at ~99.4-100.6, along with aches, fogginess and loss of appetite.

Slept some and the next day felt significantly better. Light body aches and headache, tired. Back to almost 100% two days later/48 hrs.

I had chills and my teeth were actually chattering at one point it was so bad. This gradually got worse as the evening went on. With it I also started feeling weak and fatigued. By 8pm I started to have a headache. Throughout the night symptoms worsened and I had a fever and more serious headache. My head was pounding so badly. I couldn&#39;t sleep at all. I also had a couple hot flashes to where I woke up sweating. Then I would feel frozen again. The nausea started during the night too. I thought I would throw up but didn&#39;t. At one point my heart was racing so fast I was a little concerned something bad would happen to me and contemplated going to the hospital. By morning I felt a little better, still nauseous and with a bad headache. My body was a little weak. These symptoms lasted all day Thursday. By that Friday morning I only had a little weakness and slight headache. By mid day Friday I was pretty much back to normal.

                                                Got a pretty significant headache within minutes of injection (Friday) Experienced extreme fatigue day after the vaccine (Saturday) The next day started to feel okay and then got intense stomach pains and bad nausea (Sunday) Now on this Monday, I am still fatigued, nauseous, and feeling like the flu  Not sure if this has to do with the vaccine, just wanted to report.

A few hours after, I felt flushed and slightly feverish with generalized body aches. 6-7 hours after the vaccine, I experienced extreme fatigue, extremely high fever that registered as &#34;err&#34; consecutively on the thermometer numerous times (min of 5 times checked), severe headache, worsening body aches, left flank pain, GI upset with nausea, congestion, dizziness and many heart palpitations. The high fever broke around 11pm and my temp was 102 when checked then and I was drenched in sweat. The fever continued to decrease throughout the next 12 hours. The extreme fatigue, severe headache, dizziness , GI upset and nausea continued throughout the day Saturday and most of Sunday.  I also experienced burning in my chest that radiated into both shoulders, anterior/posterior neck and between both shoulder blades in my back all day Saturday. The burning has decreased over this past week, but I am still experiencing it with some exertion, but not consistently.  Fatigue continues some and SOB at random times.

                                                5.5 hours after getting the vaccine, I had chills (guessing I had a fever) body aches, a headache, joint pain, muscle pain, skin pain, nausea, I was exhausted, felt very emotional (felt like crying), had the constant feeling like I needed to stretch, and I could not get comfortable or lay still. At one point my fever broke, I woke up at 245 am drenched in sweat. The symptoms previously stated all came back about 255 am. I could not get comfortable or sleep but was extremely exhausted.  I tossed and turned getting tiny naps here and there until I got out of bed at 8 am (4/8/2021), I was again drenched in sweat, tired, had a headache,  was nauseous and food sounded horrible. I could not move around much because of joint/muscle pain and would get random bouts of chills. I had to just lay down all day but was never hungry and  did not eat again until that night around 7pm. On 4/9/2021 I woke up at 630am drenched in sweat I was still tired and could not exert myself (just going downstairs made me have to stop and catch my breath) throughout the day I would get random nerve pain in the elbow  and forearm of the shot arm. This morning I woke up with the shot site hurting worse, a headache, still tired and drenched in sweat (it was 40 degrees in my house and i had a thin blanket covering me). My appetite is back today but still cannot exert myself.

My stomach hurt, I was nauseated. I went through hot &amp; cold sweats &amp; chills. I got really light headed &amp; disoriented. I began to get a fever.  I felt far from flu symptoms. My heart was racing. I had to get into my shower repeatedly &amp; just lay. I cried. I dont recommend this to anyone! It has been 2 days &amp; i am still experiencing symptoms. I read the fact sheet for the Janssen shot. I am going to get a check up by a doctor. I feel like I am having an allergic reaction. I never felt so much pain in my life; my side effects are far from the flu symptoms.

I went to dr who advised I was having an allergic reaction and told me to take benedryl I had a 2in by 2inch hive under my skin at my time of visit which had gone down a little because of benedryl and it was extremely painful even 9 days out. I experienced extreme confusion and mental fog from Sunday all the way to Wednesday where I felt confused, and was having some rapid breathing.

After that I felt flushed, and around 5:30pm I had a fever and my heart rate began to rise and blood pressure drop.. My heart rate continued to rise until about 9:30pm, and then it began to fall. I also experienced a terrible headache, moderate body aches, and chills and hot flashes. But the diarrhea and rapid heart rate were very concerning to me--I felt very sure something was wrong. This morning I have a low heart rate and low blood pressure and I feel very weak, but other symptoms are gone. I don&#39;t have a primary care doctor and read that the diarrhea and heart symptoms could be signs of a severe reaction and I wanted to report it.

                                                Normal side affects felt: fever, chills, body aches. Felt by 5pm and lasted until the next morning ~0700. After symptoms broke, the feeling of sluggish occurred all next couple of days. Throughout, it seemed like I could not quench my thirst.  Additionally, red bumpy rash on my legs (mostly thighs) occurred and itching along with it on legs. Not enough to go to emergency room, but definitely uncomfortable. Took Benadryl to help. Subsided about a week later. At injection site, only bruise which I am guessing was from some abnormal bleeding that occurred at injection. I barely had any soreness in the arm.  Lastly, a feeling of inability to take a deep enough breath. A feeling of if I had vicks on my chest type cool feeling when I took a breath. The feeling has lingered until now, but not enough to cause any issue. I can breath, but not full deep breaths. Because it has been getting better every day, I imagine it will subside soon. I will go to doctor if it does not get better.

Numbness lasted about an hour. 40-50 minutes post vaccine nausea would come and go. 4 hours post vaccine the typical flu-like symptoms began: extreme fatigue, mild headache, muscle weakness, painful skin, lack of appetite.

                                                I have many allergies and adverse events from prior vaccines, so I took a Benadryl before the injection. I was very pleased nothing detrimental happened at the time. My head and neck were a little itchy but went away, some dizzyness but went away, all after about an hour. The arm didn&#39;t blow up like usual.  That night, I started to experience the usual vaccine side effects i.e. headache, feverish, sweating, joint aches. All this I expected starting around 8:45 -9pm.   At about 10 - 10:30 pm, I began to have abdomen pain/pelvic pain... I started feeling like I was getting period cramps and lower intestinal discomfort. I just had my period though, so it didn&#39;t make sense (about 7 -10 days ago). I am also on the pill so I know for a fact I just had it and started a new pack. I was very confused and thought it was odd...can&#39;t be, maybe it would go away.   I woke up about 3am with intense uterus/period cramps which kept me up, in and out of sleep. About 5am I felt like I had my period (fluid down there), went to the bathroom and indeed, I was bleeding... a lot. The cramps continued, the bleeding continued and now 6 days later it is finally going away. I never get head aches and my head has continued to hurt on and off also.

                                                * Arm was very sore for about the first 10 minutes.  Moving it reduced it pretty quickly and was no worse than a minor ache for most of the next day or so. * Had a mild headache before the shot (believe due to not having had caffeine that day yet) * At about 6 pm on 4/10, lost appetite due to mild nausea (just enough to not want to eat but not enough to vomit) * At about this time I noticed I also started to feel a little winded, akin to walking just briskly enough that you have to breath harder than if you&#39;re just sitting / resting.  It did not get any worse than this however, so I opted to keep a close eye and see if it eased (which it would by end of Sunday, 4/11) * At about 8:30 pm on 4/10, noticed I felt warm, had a fever between 100.4 to 100.8 * Also around 8:30 pm I noticed that pain I normally feel from my herniated discs and pinched nerves (L4/L5 L5/S1) just ACHED and was more painful than normal. * Started feeling tired (I&#39;m usually up until around 1-2 am, and I was ready to go to bed by 9pm on 4/10)  Also felt a little forgetful / hard to concentrate on anything * When I went to bed, I noticed that my eyes were very sensitive to the white light from my monitor.  This is usually a sign of a painless migraine with auras that essentially blind me for about a half hour.  I did not have auras, though my headache was steadily getting worse to the point I suspect it might have actually been a migraine) * At about 12:30 am on 4/11, the headache got to the point where I could no longer ignore it (best I can describe is it felt like someone was trying to peel my skull of like you would an orange) so I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen.  I also by this point had a fever of 102, though it would drop to 100.5 or so within a few minutes of taking the Ibuprofen. * At about this point the arm starting aching a lot more, I assume because I wasn&#39;t using it while sleeping.  It felt like someone had punched me multiple times hard in the same spot. * I felt much better on the morning of 4/11.  However as the day continued I felt more and more tired.  My temperature was higher than normal but very mild; it stayed around 99.8 for most of the day that I took it.  By Monday, 4/12 I felt mostly fine aside from my arm aching worse than it did when I first got the shot.  Now on 4/14 its pretty much no longer achy.

                                                Around 6 pm on the ninth, I started to feel lethargic; really lethargic. 8:30 pm - 100.5 fever. 09:00 pm I had chills that shook my body. Very intense. Extreme body aches and especially legs which prompted me to use a weighted blanket. That was all overnight and excessive sweating overnight. That may have been from the fever. I had nausea that started around midnight. That was mild. I did notice a little bit of a headache at that time as well which was mild. Saturday, fever all day, fatigue. Overnight that night - a little achy; but the chills had gone away. Tuesday night the body aches had gone away - they had diminished Saturday- Monday. I had body aches until about 6 or 7 pm on Monday. The fatigue -all this week I&#39;ve still been dragging - I&#39;m still tired. The fever would go up and down with Tylenol but I needed it until Sunday night. Headache - the first one was gone Saturday morning. I had a headache  Sunday evening and Monday morning. It was gone about lunch time.  The injection site was tender with the delivery of the shot until Sunday when I went to bed. It was not pain but just tender to the touch. Usually that happens with any shot for me but usually it doesn&#39;t stay tender for that long. April 13th - Televisit with a Physician&#39;s Asst in my doctor&#39;s office.

Those symptoms lasted about 24 hours and, by midday Wednesday, she was back to her baseline of intermittent dry cough, shortness of breath, and no smell or taste.  It wasn&#39;t until Sunday, two days ago, that she developed sharp, pinpoint right superior parietal scalp pain that, after a few doses of OTC Aleve, did somewhat improve.  Other than two 220 mg OTC Aleve tabs twice daily, she has not been taking anything else for her symptoms other than prescribed asthma/allergy meds. She states that her shortness of breath has been helped from the use of albuterol as needed.  Unfortunately, the Aleve has not helped with her chest pain, which she describes as a &#34;constant ache.&#34;  Initially, patient had some pleurisy, but that has apparently cleared up.     No history of CVT, PE, and she does not smoke or take oral contraceptives.

                                                About one hour after my J&amp;J vaccine, I experienced dizziness. I took a shower and felt chills all over my body and back pain as well. I then  went to sleep and my head started to hurt. My head pain grew in intensity and I felt dizzy. At about 7pm, I started vomiting profusely because of my headaches. I then went to urgent care because I am also diabetic and was worried of how I was feeling. At the urgent care they gave me Paracetamol and nausea medication. My headaches lasted 3-4 days then they went away. Also since I was on my third day of my menstrual cycle at the time of my J&amp;J vaccine, my menstrual cycle got irregular and lasted 5 days longer than my usual 3 days.

                                                Shortly after the vaccine on the drive home the injection site got super hot, the arm began to swell and turn red.  I developed a fever and my sinuses got really stuffy.  I began to throw up profusely which made all symptoms from other issues occur causing me to swell all over and because I couldnt take any meds or keep anything down I went to the ER.   While there I began wheezing and experiencing SOB which still is an issue today.  I have foggy moments where my brain seems so foggy that I am having issues with my short term memory.  I was administered IV fluids, IV morphine and IV ibuphropen to help with the symptoms and was hospitalized for less than a day further evaluation

As I walked to the restroom to vomit I lost 100% of my vision, I became very disoriented and had the loudest screeching in both ears. I screamed for my husband and I caught me as I was taken to the floor with no mobility. The episode last several minutes before he was able to move me back to bed. I had severe sweating and ear ringing. As I report this I still have a lingering brain fog and ear ringing.  I reported it to my physician and told to go to the ER if any reoccurrence of reaction.

                                                I have a history of anaphylaxis, and disclosed that to the medics so they watched me more carefully, which was good, as while I did not experience anything that severe, I did immediately get itchy, turn red and feel quite nauseated. However,  after they monitored me awhile, I told them I felt okay to go home. The next day I had the expected mild flu-like symptoms, which I anticipated. However, what?s been atypical is they returned tenfold three days later. This time with a much higher fever (103), severe chills, fatigue, a seemingly never-ending headache,  muscle spasms,  chest palpitations and suddenly I am experiencing asthma (which is typically seasonal) and am coughing, too.  I?m now a week past when I was vaccinated and each day was feel worse, not better. I have had to cancel my clients and hire a sitter to care for my kids as I am too weak and ill to do it.  I looked up common reactions and nothing states chest pain and/or asthma, nor that it should last this long. That said, as I am high-risk, I work from home and homeschool both of my young kids. Thus, I have been nowhere aside from the vaccine site. Moreover, my partner, our kids and sitter get routinely tested for me,  and everyone is negative. Thus, it appears I am having prolonged, heightened side-effects much more intense than the ?mild? flu-like symptoms otherwise reported, which is concerning. I took no medication prior to receiving the vaccine, either.

                                                I developed joint pain approximately 8 hours after vaccination, at 10 PM, beginning in the hips and spreading throughout the entire body.  Around 11 PM, I began to experience chills. Around midnight, I developed a pounding headache. Around 1 AM, I began to experience muscle pain. Around 2 AM, I began to experience nausea and sweating. Around 3 AM, I experienced tachycardia, with a pulse rate of between 110 and 120 beats per minute while lying down. Throughout the time, I was lying in bed but not sleeping. I was unable to work the next day and spent most of it in bed.

By 7-8 hours after receiving the shot, I started noticing a fever. Had a fever of 102 all night along with chills, extreme body aches, and headache. Temperature stayed between 100.5 and 101.5 all day today (the day after the vaccine), and the body aches and general feeling of being unwell are still being experienced. I am guessing my immune system is reacting to the vaccine and hopefully the symptoms will subside soon. I have not reached out to my doctor at this time.

About 30 mins to an hour later I notice that every move I make, the joints I&#39;m moving hurt. Like EVERY joint is now sore when I move. (With the exception of fingers/toes) I tossed and turned all night and got a headache. The queasiness was very mild, but happened any time I moved.  This morning now my joints no longer hurt, but I still have the headache.

                                                The shot was administered by a young woman at pharmacy, who I later learned was an intern. She injected the shot less than two fingers down from my shoulder bone, much higher than I have ever had an injection given before.  I immediately felt intense pain, and the intern had trouble pushing the syringe down fully.  She said ?I need help!?, and her male manager ran over, and quickly jabbed the syringe further into my arm, and pressed extremely hard down on the syringe, forcing the remaining contents into my arm. I immediately felt a shooting, searing pain down my entire arm, into my wrist, and  my arm went numb, felt heavy, and tingly by my hand.  The manager pulled the needle out of my arm, and said ?you must have hit bone, the needle is bent?.  I then felt extremely nauseous and woozy, and my vision started going in and out.  I fanned myself and after about five minutes my vision stabilized, and I felt less nauseous.  It is now 9 hours later and I have intense shoulder and neck pain, and limited range of motion of my shoulder.

About 20 mins after vaccine I was slightly dizzy and vision a little blurry. I sat down a few more minutes.  About 3 hours later that even is when the chills, body aches, migraine started.   All thru that night I was in pain.  Next day still felt like my head was in a vice with a migraine.  The chills had gone away. still had body aches just not as severe.  Day 3 after vaccine.  SLight headache (nothing  like the vice headache) , arm is still very sore. body aches have subsided considerably.   I treated with taking Tylenol and using a heating pad on my arm and back to help with body aches and pain,.

My lower abdomen and back also hurt and was cramping as if I was in labor.  I took two Tylenol PM and 10mg of Cyclobenzaprine. Then the chills started, I have never been that cold in my life while I was shivering that is when the sweating started and a basically sweat through three pairs of pajamas last night. Woke up around 3am with a pounding headache. By 10am I was feeling wrung out, but a lot better. I took some more Tylenol and went back to sleep. Woke up around 3:30pm took a shower and was able to take my daughter to soccer. I am still weak and have some achiness in my knees and ankles.

My pupils were really small. I felt out of it. Finally I got home (son drove me). I had mild chest pains and heart racing (had this initially, too). And the chest pains and heart racing kept happening off and on through the night. I had headaches that night and I felt nauseated. Next day, I had to wear sunglasses inside my  house as I was light sensitive and my pupils remained small. I still felt body aches and nausea but the eyes were the biggest concern...shining light by my eyes didn&#39;t make my pupils bigger. The light that came off my phone aggravated my eyes and my head. Thursday, I still had nausea but headache wasn&#39;t bad with Tylenol. Those full two days all I did was sleep. Friday, I felt like things were mild and Tylenol was helping. I called heathline for my eyes. As those still weren&#39;t improving. I got into my eye doctor for an exam (4/9). There was no inflammation and he decided to dilate my eyes. Of course, my eyes were blurry and my eyes responded to that dilation. I napped after returning home. My pupils after the nap were finally responding. I still had a little light sensitivity in my eyes but not as much as I had had and pupils were doing what they should with light. So this was 3 1/2 days later. I still do get mild headache and mild chest pain - it comes and it goes. I have a doctor appt - general check up  - that was already scheduled for tomorrow and he will examine for chest pain.

From 10pm that same evening until 10am the next morning, I experienced a severe headache - took ibuprofen with no relief, fever of 101, sweating (my air conditioning was on 66 degrees and I was still sweating) and nausea without vomiting. The symptoms persisted overnight until subsiding the next morning. Soreness at the injection site continued for an additional three days until approximately Saturday morning. No other symptoms since then to date.

                                                On the day after vaccination I had extreme dizziness and faintheadedness, and heavy brain fog. I could not drive or stand up for long periods of time. I was having issues expressing thoughts and having my normal conversations. This was accompanied by strong headache on right side of my head and slightly stuffed sinuses. The day afterwards all symptoms disappeared. However, they reappeared at milder levels intermittently through the next several days. I am now at day 14 with the dizziness and brain fog still occurring intermittently and last night had short episode of abdominal pain. I decided to call the doctor&#39;s office this morning when the dizziness started again, for advice and to schedule a brief exam. They told me to go straight to the ER instead, so I went and had blood drawn. Blood came back normal and likelihood of clot very low, so was released but referred to my primary doctor and a neurologist for follow up over the next week. The intermittent dizziness and brain fog persist ever since my shot 2 weeks ago. Additional symptoms that I believe to be normal are dull leg pain behind the knees, slight tightness in chest sometimes, and recurring mild headache.

                                                Immediate arm pain when the injection was administered, was painful to raise arm after the shot, for hours. Made effort to continue to raise the arm and engage the muscle to alleviate pain, which helped by the end of *that day*, though tenderness persisted at the injection site for the following 4 to 5 days, including feeling pain when sleeping on that arm. Also, on the day of receiving the vaccine and dealing with the initial sore arm, I experienced a surge of energy lasting into the evening, that is common to me right before I fall sick ( for example as a runner, it sometimes manifests as a PR and then soon after that I get sick). The morning after the vaccine, I woke up slightly queasy, ate breakfast,  went for a bike ride and hike, then headache &amp; nausea appeared near lunchtime (1 pm). I pushed through the rest of the afternoon but headache/nausea worsened, and by late afternoon (maybe 5 pm) I also had developed body aches, chills (with sweats), and low-grade fever.

I still had  a slight headache. The abdominal pain comes and goes - I still get it to this day. I called my Dr and he referred me to go to ER on Tuesday, 13th. No treatment, they told me to follow up with dr if I had pain continue.  I just went today to a follow up with my doctor. She increased my medication for pain so I can get to work as I&#39;ve been out for the last 5 days since I have not been able to. She told me to do the Naproxen twice  a day now and also gave me Gabapentin and Tramadol.

                                                Within minutes of shot, on the shot going in - it stung so bad I cried and I have a high pain tolerance &gt; extreme nausea right after the shot was in; I felt short of breath - Heartrate - While standing in line, my heartrate was 75 or 76  and it went up to 130  beats per minute after the vaccine (I have a watch that tells me); my heart was racing. I was putting cold water bottles on my neck to feel better. Heartrate went from 130 to 100 at 45 minutes out. It stayed in the hundreds for a couple of hours. About three hours after shot - I developed itching and hives all over - chest, arms, and tops of thighs. I took Benadryl. The injection site on arm stayed incredibly painful - I couldn&#39;t even move my arm. 4/12/2021 - I got in contact with someone from Clinic. They felt like there had been a reaction to vaccine - advised to continue Benadryl. A localized reaction to injection site. First 48 hours  bone, muscle, joint pain was extreme - it hurt to be alive. It took a week for that to fade so I could function again. Got in contact with Dr. again 19th. Swollen oval under my skin about 2 -3 inches long at injection site; fatigue and nausea is still there. Ran some bloodwork. Advised to take Benadryl when itching came back. This morning, I called the doctor today 20th - an allergist was pulled in for this conversation as well - I was prescribed to take Zyrtec; Claritin and a prednisone (to prevent reaction from continuing) and also Zofran for the long term reaction to the vaccine. Watch the injection site for any redness and heat (there&#39;s none right now). Three days after vaccine, I did get a blistery rash across my neck at my collarbone area, down my chest and under my breast and across my rib cage on front and a little on my back on the back of my shoulders and down along the spine. Additionally there was a flat orangish rash that developed - on my face and nose. And then my skin started peeling off there and it (that flat orangish rash) showed up  also on the middle of my chest too right in the middle of the other rash on my chest. That is improving with the medications I&#39;m taking.
