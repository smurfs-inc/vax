                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Six hours after I received the vaccine I began to feel full body muscle aches and shivers. I took 2 Advil. I went to bed at 9:30 p.m. and woke up at 11:30 p.m. feeling as though I had slept 8 hours because I had a 102 fever. My face was burning from the heat and I was shaking. I took two more Advil. About 30 minutes later I threw up. I waited 30 more minutes and threw up again. As a result, of having Addison&#39;s disease, I have an emergency steroid injection that I use during crises such as this. I took my shot and immediately began feeling slightly better. I was able to go back to bed and at some point the fever went down overnight. I am currently feeling weak and with no fever. I also have a slight headache.

                                                Hi, I received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine one week ago, Thurs March 11. On friday, I experienced the typical flu like symptoms - chills aches pains and fever. These have slowly gone away, but a week later I still have chills and constantly shake, and diarrhea. The most significant side effect I want to report is extreme vertigo and dizziness and headaches. These have been present for a week now and have prevented me from working and doing daily activities. I constantly feel like Im going to fall over and cannot see clearly. I previously had vestibular migraines, but these have been mostly gone due to going to the chiropractor and taking my supplements. The vaccine brought them back now in full force. I read that this is becoming a commonality among other people and need answers on this. I want to make sure its not permanent or that I will have this as a serious side effect.

She returned to the post-vaccine administration monitoring area after about two minutes to sit down again.  At that time, I asked more questions about symptoms.  She was also feeling weak and like she may pass out.  I gave her a cold compress to place on her neck which improved her symptoms very rapidly.  She remained in the area with the cold compress for about 10 more minutes before she felt well and she then left with her husband.

Patient did not hit the ground or injure herself-she did not lose consciousness she was flushed and sweating.  Pharmacist sat on floor with patient for 2-3 minutes and gave her water, patient was then able to stand up with little assistance and brought to sit down.  Patient stated she felt nauseous and may vomit she was given a trash can but did not vomit she was able to drink a bottle of water and was given a soft pretzel.  After about 10 minutes she stated she was feeling much better was no longer flushed or sweating she called her boyfriend for a  ride home.

I had to go home from work due to these feelings. Eventually, developed into a fever. I went home and the chills and aches worsened. I could not get warm not matter how many layers or blankets I had. I took tylenol and fell asleep after several hours. When I woke up, I was profusely sweaty, my fever  broke. I was able to eat a small lunch and continued to lie down the whole day. My symptoms lessened and were more minimal 24 hours after. After going to sleep the second night, I felt back to normal upon wake up.

                                                Injection technique seemed poor as it was the most painful vaccination I&#39;ve ever received, and upper arm became tight and achy immediately. Soreness lingered but the sharper pain went away shortly after. About 8-10 hours later I began feeling nauseous and lightheaded. 12 hours after vaccine I had trouble falling asleep, overcome with nausea and chills.  This turns into sweating and insomnia the rest of the night. The following day I felt better, but the next night (and following one) I continued feeling a bit sick. Currently (3 days later) my upper arm is still very sore and I have lots of muscle/joint aches throughout my whole body.

                                                15 hours after I was vaccinated I woke up with a severe headache and also felt very hot/feverish. When I got up at 3:30 am to get some water/Advil I also felt light stomach pain  and dizziness.  It took me about an hour to go back to sleep. Currently the time is 11:00 AM on 07APR2021 and I am experiencing a light headache, but am no longer experiencing dizziness or stomach pain. Arm is still sore from the site of injection.

                                                Vaccination appointment was at 1:30 pm on Monday, April 5. I received the shot at around 2:00pm in my left arm. It hurt going in, but quickly dissipated as I moved my arm. I felt fine for the rest of the day. I felt normal the following morning (April 6), but started to feel tired in the early afternoon. I took a nap around 3:00-4:30pm, and woke up feeling slightly hungry. I went to bed around 11:00pm. I woke up the next day (April 7) with a headache. I called in sick to work and stayed in bed as my headache grew worse and nausea began to appear. I threw up for the first time at 11:00am, then again around 11:30am. I emptied my bowels in between these bouts of vomiting, and my stomach was very obviously empty after the second bout. I took a nap from 12:00-2:00pm, after which I threw up at 2:30pm and then again at 3:00pm and again at 3:30pm. I took another nap from 4:00-5:00pm, then threw up again around 5:30pm. I threw up a seventh time around 6:00pm and saw  a couple flecks of blood in my vomit. Each bout was sudden in onset and violent but quick. I think I burst some of the blood vessels in my throat, because it was sore. I called a friend to take me to the ER, and threw up once or twice more while waiting. On the way to the ER, I threw up for the last time. The ER gave me Toradol, Zofran, and two bags of IV fluids. This improved all my symptoms. The next morning, April 8, I felt much better until 12:00pm, when I laid down for a nap and couldn&#39;t get out of bed until 4:30. My headache had returned so I took Advil, then ate some rice. I felt better from 6:00pm onwards.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine I had extreme sleepiness and some dizziness. After taking a nap I felt better for a few hours. I did notice my Raynaud?s symptoms became way worse.  At about 5:30pm I started to feel extremely cold. By 6pm I was having horrible pains and spasms in my lower back and hips. My muscles and joints became very stiff. This moved to my neck/shoulders, and down my thighs. I lost feeling in my feet and started struggling to be able to take in a full breath. I felt like my whole body was locked up. I started feeling nauseous, but part of that may have been from the nerves. The next morning I felt a bit more mobile but still nauseous and stiff. I have slowly gotten better throughout the day, but am still stiff and exhausted

                                                Around 6 pm after receiving the vaccine, I had a massive headache (felt like my head was being compressed severely), chills and body aches all over, pain and swelling at the injection site, nausea, a fever of 100 F, and my bones feeling brittle/weak.  I had blankets piled on me, an ice pack on my head, and two ibuprofen.   The fever broke over night and the headache reduced over night as well. The oter symptoms became less severe over the course of the 28th and are only remnant on the 29th. The arm pain and swelling are still present and I have muscle tension and pain pulsing up the left upper back/ neck area.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Received the shot at 11 am and started feeling tired with some muscle aches at 2:45 pm. I slept from 3:45 to 4:30 pm but was still tired and felt weak. I did feel hungry and made dinner over 30 minutes. However, this wore me out. I was even more tired and started getting dizzy. I almost fainted as I made my way to a chair to sit down. I couldn&#39;t eat because of slight nausea and cold chills. I was shaking for about 20 minutes. Eventually, I made it to my bed to lay down, but my legs were shaking as I walked up the stairs. At 6:00 pm, my temperature was 98.8 F. I was freezing a shivering for the next hour in bed under 3 blankets. My hands and feet felt like ice. At 8:00 pm, I had a fever of 100.2  F that lasted all night. My body ached all over, especially at the hips. I couldn&#39;t sit still and couldn&#39;t sleep until 4:00 am. I woke at 8:30 am with some milder aches and fatigue with a temperature of 97.6 F.

No swelling or redness but my arm hurts to touch or move. Beginning this morning (4/1/21) around 7:30 am I started having a headache.  I took an ibuprofen which slightly lessened the pain but it has not gone away all day.  It worsens with activity. Starting around 8:30-9:00 am I started to feel nauseous and lightheaded.  I didn&#39;t take any medication for these symptoms.  They&#39;ve stuck with me all day. Starting around 11:30am I started to feel cold chills and body/muscle aches.  This has continued throughout the day. Starting around 2:45 pm I&#39;ve felt feverish, with severe cold chills.

                                                About an hour after injection (~9:15am), I felt mild fatigue and a very mild headache. The fatigue progressed throughout the day and made me very exhausted. About 8 hours after the injection, I had chills, still fatigued, mild headache, and about an hour later I ran a low grade fever (about 99*).  Took Tylenol to keep my fever down. Temp shot back up to 101* a few hours later (still having body aches, fatigue and chills, and some mild nausea at this point.) My fever broke about 19 hours after the injection. 24 hours after the injection, the injection site was sore and I had a moderate headache with mild nausea. This continued throughout the day so I rested. 48 hours after the injection, still soreness in my upper left arm from the injection with mild headache, mild nausea and small lack of appetite. 72 hours after injection, completely back to normal with some soreness in my upper left arm at injection site.

                                                I awoke at 6:45 a.m. feeling a bit sore in my arm, but relatively okay.  I was up for approximately ten minutes and then extended my arms over my head to stretch out some of the achiness and immediately regretted the action.  I began to feel dizzy and nauseous and saw black spots encroaching on my peripheral vision.  I washed my face to relieve some discomfort with no change.  I walked toward the bedroom to grab my glass of water when the black spots increased, clouded my entire vision, and I collapsed on the bed.  I then began to hyper-salivate and after waking my husband and catching my breath, I returned to bathroom, experienced diarrhea, and simultaneously vomited into the trash can.  The vomit tasted chemical and extremely acidic.  My body was also shaking uncontrollably during this time and I kept switching between chills and being too hot.  After I felt comfortable leaving the bathroom, I crawled back in bed but was shaking so much that I couldn&#39;t stop my teeth from chattering and could not get warm no matter that my husband placed an extra blanket over me.  I had taken my temperature before while I was in the bathroom and it read 94.6 degrees Fahrenheit.  I took it again in bed about twenty minutes later and it read 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.  My head was splitting and my arm ached, but I was eventually able to go back to sleep.  I felt better after sleeping for a few hours and drinking more fluids.

                                                I had the Janssen covid shot yesterday. The shot stung a little and made my arm sore. Later on in the evening I became tired (so far nothing I didn&#39;t assume would happen) so I took a nap. When I woke up, my arm stung worse than when I had the shot and the pain kept shooting up my shoulder into my neck. I went back to sleep, thinking it was just normal vaccine stuff. When I woke up this morning, I had chills, a fever of 101.7, and muscle aches. My body feels like I have a sunburn all over it. My right arm feels like it was stung by a scorpion. I feel dizzy and nauseous, and I have head fog. I feel the exact same way I did when I had COVID19, but with my arm hurting so bad, anything that barely touches it (such as clothes) shoots a stinging pain up my neck

I took two pills of extra strength Tylenol and water and laid back down to break the fever and help with the aches and pains. I woke up around 9:30am on 3/13/21 and did not have and appetite all day. I was extremely fatigued all day and had no energy to get out of bed or do much.  On 3/14/21 I began to develop an appetite again around noon. I was still fatigued. My arm was very tender and itchy at the injection site and hurt to the touch. My 5:00pm on 3/14/21 I had more energy and the aches were gone but my arm was still hurting and sore.

                                                15 mins after receiving the vaccine, I began feeling nauseous. One hour after receiving the vaccine, I began throwing up. I could not keep anything down until 2 PM the next day. I was also extremely tired and slept most of the next day. I was 10 weeks pregnant at the time of receiving the vaccine. Had a terrible headache. I took Tylenol for the headache.

The day after I recieved the covid vaccine Janssen, I started noticing the injection site getting red and swollen. By the next day it had grown in size and was itching rather badly. I could sleep from how badly it was itching and burning. It has been 6 days since I got the vaccine and it&#39;s still large and swollen and really itchy. I have been taking ibuprofen for the pain and using benadryl for the itching.

                                                I received the vaccine at 1:30 pm in the afternoon on 3/22/21 and immediately afterwards I felt fine. I waited my 15 minutes and had no signs of a reaction and was free to go. Later in the afternoon, around 3:15 pm, I began to feel a little fatigued and my arm was sore. Around 6:00 pm that same night, I developed a low grade temp of 99.8, I was very fatigued, had achiness all over, as well as my arm was very warm and tender.  I was unable to sleep through the night of 3/22/21 into 3/23/21 and got out of bed around 4: 30 am on 3/23/21 and had to call into work due to the pain. The pain was not an achiness but sharp throughout my whole body. Around 9:00 am, I took a pain reliever and was able to sleep for a few hours. Upon waking up around 1:30-2:00 pm, I was still hurting and was then nauseated as well. I tried to drink water and ate a few crackers to settle my stomach with no relief. At 5:15 pm on 3/23/21, I went to the bathroom and got in the shower to try to help with the pain. After a few minutes in the shower, I became extremely lightheaded and felt like I was going to be sick. I sat down in the bathtub and hollered for my mother to come help me because at this point, I felt like I needed to go to the hospital. Upon sitting down in the bathtub, I began to profusely vomit and started to lose feeling in my legs. My mother entered the bathroom and I explained what was happening and soon after my hands contracted and were stuck in an abnormal position. The pain was unbearable and I was unable to move them from that position. I was unable to get myself out of the bathtub so my mom then called for an ambulance. These symptoms occurred somewhere around 5:20-5:21 pm and EMS was called at 5:22 pm. After a few minutes, I was able to regain movement of my legs but my hands and fingers were still contracted and unmovable. I was able to help my mother enough to put my clothes on and to make my way outside to the front porch to get fresh air. After getting outside, I was accompanied by my mother and my neighbor whom is a nurse. My neighbor looked at my hands and noticed they were discolored and she attempted to straighten out my fingers to no avail. The pain in my fingers was sharp and excruciating but there was also a pins and needle type pain as well. I remained outside until EMS arrived. I was then transported to Hospital where I was seen in the ER for this. Upon arrival to the ER, the physician ordered labs and fluids and stated that apparently he had seen at least 2 other cases that day with a similar reaction to the vaccine. He explained that I was having an adverse reaction to the vaccine and that my hands should return to normal within 24-48 hours. I was then discharged home. As of 3/24/21, I was able to straighten my left hand out and my right hand, my fingers would straighten out, but they would return to a curled resting position. As of 3/25/21, I returned to work and I have some weakness in both hands with a slight discoloration of each hand as well. I am a nurse and work in an office and the physicians in my office commented on the color of skin upon seeing them. I was still very achy and fatigued. My arm was still sore and tender as well. As of today, 3/26/21, I am still achy as well as tired. My right hand has improved some but still returns to a curled resting position. The color of my hands has improved as well. I am a nurse and have seen many things throughout my career. This experience has been absolutely terrifying and I still have no answers as to why this happened to my body. I did my part by being vaccinated and was terrified that I was going to lose my life to it. I pray this does not happen to anyone else.

I was fine early in the morning and then stated feeling nausea and I vomited 3 times and was unable to retain fluids or food. Everything I tried to consume something I would throw it up.  The vomiting and Dehydration was the worst, I had nausea in my first trimester so not sure if it&#39;s linked to my pregnancy.  I called my OB and spoke with them on the phone, they were concerned at on point but eventually was able to hold down an Gatorade and Tylenol . The other effect I had were mainly fatigue and headache but Tylenol helped with both of those.  I still feel tired but other than that no other symptoms.  By Friday evening I was feeling fine, the only thins that carried on was fatigue. I didn&#39;t experience  site pain, no redness, swelling or hurting.

Around 8:15pm, I started to develop chills. From there, I developed a fever, headache, neck soreness and body aches in my joints (particularly wrists, knees, elbows). I contained the fever with extra strength Tylenol taken according to the box instructions. The fever broke overnight.  I had a 99 degree temperature the next day (3:00 pm) after the vaccine, and experienced fatigue and body aches. Those symptoms largely subsided by the morning of 3/21.   I still (as of the PM on 3/22) have no appetite and a persistent feeling of &#34;fullness&#34; in my stomach.

By 4pm I had a headache, body aches, upset stomach, tired, fever, and chills. My fever would go up and down, highest was 103.2 reached that temp 3 times. By 2am my mother drove me to the ER. I was diagnosed with a migraine and was given IV fluids and an IV migraine cocktail. After receiving the fluids and meds I felt much better and was released back home. I periodically have pain in the injection site.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I began to feel nauseous, almost like being car sick while looking at my phone. I also began to feel tightness in my chest. After my 15 minutes were up I asked the administrator of my shot if it was normal that I felt dizzy/chest tightness. They said it was probably fine and just to monitor my  symptoms. I went and sat in my car a few min and I began to feel very strange, it seemed very bright out, I felt weak, and my eyes felt very heavy. I wanted to get home so I started driving but on the highway, my heart beat was very fast and I began to feel like I couldn&#39;t swallow. At one point felt as though I might be about to choke so I pulled over because I thought I was going to have to dial 911 as my throat was feeling like it was closing up. I tried swallowing a few times with great effort and after a few minutes the sensation started to lessen. My throat hadn&#39;t closed up completely, however it did feel like it had swelled up.

                                                Mild headache and nausea set in shortly after the injection on Friday, but went away after rest and eating/drinking. My arm was sore for the entire evening. I woke up around 2am Saturday morning and became dizzy. I fell to the floor and passed out for a short period of time. When I woke, I was extremely nauseous to the point of nearly vomiting. I had chills and fever. I could hardly move due to weakness - I needed help getting back into bed. When I woke the next morning, I had 100.3 fever, I had a headache and my entire body was sore. My fever went away late Saturday afternoon, but I still felt mildly nauseous. It is Monday and I still have mild nausea and light-headedness. My arm is only slightly sore.

Ibuprofen is not helping with this pain.  pt contacted her PCP and was to call us and and take Tylenol or ibuprofen and rest.

                                                I received the vaccine at 36 weeks pregnant. I am estimated to deliver April 16th.  About 8 hours after receiving the vaccine I noticed general bodily discomfort and achiness, as well as a loss of appetite and a headache. About 30 minutes after that I developed chills but no fever, and was fatigued enough to fall asleep an hour before my usual bedtime. I slept terribly in the night due to the achiness and pain at the injection site making it hard to lay on my side, which I have to do for pregnancy. I went to bed with chills but woke up sweating and discovered a fever of 100.2 around 12:45 AM. By 5:30 my temperature was down to 98. The following morning I continue to experience achiness, fatigue, decreased appetite, and a headache. I seem to have felt some pelvic cramping associated with pregnancy but it may be unrelated.

I missed work for these days. The nausea has persisted and I am on day 19 after the vaccine and am still having severe nausea. No chance of pregnancy

                                                I received the Janssen (J&amp;J) vaccine at 11:12pm on 3/5/2021. I went to bed with a slightly sore arm. I woke up the following day 3/6/2021 with a slight headache and feeling a little achy. At around 11:00-12:00pm on 3/6/2021 I started having a fever, chills, aches, an increasingly bad headache. For the next 18 hours I had a fever, shaking, aches, bad migraine headache, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. I felt increasingly sick and my lowest point was at around 9:00pm on 3/6/2021 when I vomited. Around 5:00-6:00am on 3/7/2021 I felt considerably better and no longer had a fever. I was exhausted and still had a headache. I was very fatigued for the next two weeks.   I was menstruating when I received the vaccine. My menstruation stopped when I was having side effects for about 2-3 days and then started again.  In addition, I have psoriasis and on 3/7/2021 my skin looked noticeably better than it had looked before I received the vaccine. The psoriasis I had on my hands almost completely disappeared. A few days later, my psoriasis looked worse than I had looked before I received the vaccine. Today 3/29/2021, my psoriasis is back to how it looked right before I received the vaccination.

I woke up to my husband holding my head and yelling my name. I had been seizing and had bitten my tongue. I was very white and nauseous and cold and shaky. They gave me water and a cold pack. The seizure probably only lasted for 5 seconds but it&#39;s hard to say. I felt very fatigued afterwards. I stayed for 10 more min and drank water and then they sent me on my way.

I wasn&#39;t able to get up and my arm swelled up really bad.  I was having streak in my vison and really bad dey eyes and mouth.  I had a fever on going for about 3 weeks straight. I called my Doctor the following day and she said it was a normal reaction, if it get&#39;s worse to call her again. I called her again because it got worse, my neck got swollen. left arm was trembling, lymph nodes were swollen, leg leg was pulsating. I started having chills and hot flashes ( I still have some till this day). My Doctor recommended seeing a specialist- Neurologist, Infectious Disease Dr.  The Neurologist said he can see where I get the trembles but does not  want to put me on medication and see if it goes away on it&#39;s own. I have a follow up with him regarding trembles, headache, flashing in my eyes. The Infectious Disease Dr. I&#39;m following up her her again regarding my arm swelling, they prescribed me steroids but had not gone down.  Since all of this I have been very fatigue, this is everyday.

                                                6 hours after I got the vaccine I started getting a headache, followed quickly by horrible body chills and then horrible body aches. My temperature about an hour later was 105. I took 1000 mg of Tylenol right away and put a cold rag on my head and tried to go to sleep. A couple hours later my fever started breaking, when it was 102.7 I was a sweaty mess and extremely hot and puked a lot.  My fever and other symptoms went away within about 7 hours after my fever started breaking.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Mid Saturday night I woke up to chills and was shaking so bad I couldn&#39;t fall back asleep even after adding another layer of clothes and blanket. Sunday morning I was still very cold and tired from not sleeping. I developed body aches but they were everywhere not just my arm. I was very fatigued and didn&#39;t have an appetite. The worst part was getting a migraine with extreme light sensitivity. I couldn&#39;t stand to be around any windows without blinds. I spent the day in my bedroom sleeping with the curtains closed and an eye mask on. By that night, the migraine had subsided but I was adding hot flashes to the problem list. Had a pretty restless night again on Sunday. Woke up Monday to the light sensitivity back but not as severe. I took the day off work because I couldn&#39;t handle looking at a computer screen all day. By about 1pm I was feeling mostly back to normal. My arm is still sore near the injection site and I&#39;m a bit fatigued at times but those are the only things remaining.

I started to develop a low grade fever 8 hours after the shot. 13 hours after the shot, I had a 104.1 fever. Along with the fever, I experienced severe body aches and chills, nausea and a horrible headache. I couldn?t walk as my body was so weak and my vision was blurry. About 15 hours after the vaccine, my fever went down to 102. I was able to get up and walk to my kitchen to take some Advil. My fever broke 20 hours after the vaccine with the medicine. I?m still experiencing severe body aches, headache, nausea and chills and it has been about 30 hours after vaccine. I did have covid 3 months ago, and the symptoms from the vaccine were much worse than the symptoms I had with actual covid.

Headache and body aches became intense by 6:20pm on the day I received the vaccine. I took Tylenol Extra strength which helped the body aches and lowered the fever a bit but did little for the headache. Chills started around 10pm accompanied by vomiting and severe diarrhea at 1am. Blood pressure spiked at 142/101 shortly after third vomiting episode. Called family to take me to ER but didn?t end up going because I was able to get vomiting and blood pressure under control by 3am. Figured doctors would just hook me up to an IV of fluids and send me on my way anyway, not something I can afford. No more fever or chills since 4am on 3/14/21. Headache and diarrhea and slight nausea still persisting 29 hours after the shot. Treating symptoms with Tylenol, water, pedialyte, chicken broth, and toast diet. Unable to care for my children, worst I?ve felt in years. Regularly get the flu shot with no side effects.

I woke up Sunday morning and had shortness of breathe and have been ever since. I seen my PCP and he sent me for testing to rule out Blood clots and that came back ok, but I&#39;m still having the shortness of breathe.  If I get worse he advised me to go to the ER and if im not feeling better to call him in three days.

On that moment I lost consciousness and passed out. In my opinion, I experimented a down on sugar, which had never happened before. My husband was able to catch me and sat me on the floor. A minute after I recovered and my husband gave me fruit (Melon) to raise my blood sugar. On that moment I had lots of nauseas and diarrhea. I was feeling weak and dizzy all night and the next day. Today Wednesday March the 17 I have been feeling much better.

                                                I was fine from 10am until 3:30pm on the day of injection. I started to feel feverish and chills at 3:30 and it progressed into a 99.2 fever with all over body aches and a headache and chills. I took alkasletzer cold medicine with Tylenol in it to help with the fever. It got the symptoms down where I could move and stood in the hot shower for 30 minutes to help warm me up. I felt slightly better and still had fever symptoms and severe body aches. I started feeling unable to move due to the fever symptoms again around 9pm and took 2 extra strength Tylenol that eventually worked and I had some nausea with that. I hadn?t been able to eat because of the symptoms and the nausea could have been from taking meds on an empty stomach. I finally felt able to eat around 10pm and had some food and went to bed. I could barley sleep all night and was tossing and turning due to fever. My nose started to get runny around 10pm before I went to bed. I woke up the next day and still had the fever symptoms, body aches and the worst headache I have ever had, a 10 on the pain scale. I took another 2 extra strength Tylenol and went to sleep for 2 hours. I woke up and could tell the fever had broken and my head was still in pretty severe pain- about a 7 on the pain scale.  I was incredibly fatigued the entire day and felt hot and cold throughout the day. I was incredibly weak and needed a lot of rest. I still didn?t sleep well through the night and woke up friday feeling fatigued. I expended some energy in the am at the dog park and had to sleep for 3 hours during the day which is atypical for me. I woke up Saturday morning (today) still feeling a headache and exhaustion. I will see how the rest of the day goes and am hoping to feel better and don?t know when the symptoms will stop.

                                                Most websites said 1-2 days for side effects to kick in but I was rocked pretty hard within the first 12 hours. The biggest symptoms I had were severe body aches, debilitating chills, fluctuating fever, headache, and no appetite.  4/1/21: * 11:15am: Vaccine administered * 12pm-6pm: Arm soreness, feeling cold/experiencing some chills, minor headache and stomach ache (I felt a little off but couldn?t tell if it was real or in my head) * 5:30pm: I walk home from work, which takes about about 35 minutes. Regret the decision about 10 mins from home due to onset body aches and fatigue  * 6pm: I go straight to bed freezing with crippling chills, body aches, and a headache * 8pm: Extreme nausea kicks in, I take Advil and cannot stomach more than one bite of food; still experiencing chills and body pain * 9pm: 100.7 fever, the chills subside and I start to get hot * 10:15pm: I finally eat some food, drink more water, body still aches, start to get chilly again  * 10:45pm: My fever is down to 99.3, my ears really hurt, like, ear-infection-style pain  * 11:15pm: 12ish hours post-vaccine, I have severe body aches, I alternate between really hot and cold, take more Advil and go to bed (finally fall asleep at midnight)  4/2/21: * 6:15am: Wake up; I spent the night tossing and turning with extreme night sweats. At this point I still have a pretty bad headache and painful body aches, specifically in my lower back and legs; fall back asleep * 8am-9am: Wake up and take more Advil. My whole body hurts. Toss and turn for a bit more. Small fever?99 degree temperature. Make coffee but have absolutely no appetite. * 9am-10am: So sweaty, fever is fully breaking * 11am: No more fever, slight headache, and body aches seem to be subsiding * 11:45am: Almost exactly 24 hours later and feeling good, comparatively speaking. Finally eat a bagel * 5:30pm: After lunch, I took a nap. My body aches have completely subsided, no fever. I still have a small headache and my ears still ache. But overall, I feel pretty normal! Just a little tired but probably from lack of sleep last night.

Took acetaminophen around 1:30am and the chills subsided. Then had a fever of 101 degrees. Head ache started the same time as the chills. The next day I had full body aches, headache, nausea. Symptoms subsided as the day went on. The following day, still had some nausea.

                                                Around 3:00pm on 3/7/21 I began to feel a little tired. But 3:45pm I was experiencing muscle pain through my body at only continued to get worse. At 4:30pm I took 400mg of ibuprofen since sitting, walking, and lying down were all painful. Relief came around 5:30pm and I was able to nap for an hour. At 6:30pm I awoke and attempted to eat, as I was beginning to feel nauseous. At 8:30pm I laid down again, my symptoms returning and worsening. I was now experiencing chills with my muscle pain and a headache. Pain was located throughout my body and my skin was sensitive to the touch. At 10:30pm I began shaking violently and struggled to feel warm, despite my skill feeling hot. My temperature was not taken. Another 400mg of ibuprofen was taken and one 350mg chewable of Tums anti-acid was eaten. It was not until 12:30am that I was able to sleep again.  The morning of 3/8/21 I was still fatigued and sore. Moving was difficult and painful and nausea was still present, and my headache returned. I was unable to eat despite trying. At 10:00am I took two tablets of Excedrin Migrain and napped for almost two hours. Currently, my muscle aches are minimal and my headache has improved. This may however be due to the medication.

The arm that I got the shot in was immediately sore, and has continued to be a bit tender to touch and stiff when I move the arm. By 5pm I was feeling very fatigued. Around 7pm I began feeling cold and achy, and it has continued to progress to full body aches and chills. I have no appetite, but I?m not feeling nauseous.

                                                I had severe nausea and vomiting. I was very sensitive to smells (i.e.: jerk sauce, eggs). I started vomiting every hour from 1:30pm to 7pm the following day, Friday 3/12/21. After my first time vomiting I took two, 25mg MECLIZINE tablets but they did not help.  I could not keep anything down. I tried Water, Ginger Ale, Crackers, and Gatorade.  The all came back up within the hour. It got to the point where I was throwing up foam and green bile because my stomach was empty. I tried to eat again around 10pm and threw up again around 11:25pm. The following day, Saturday 3/13/21, I felt fine when I woke up until I started moving around. I threw up red vomit twice around midday and decided not to eat or drink anything and rest. Later that evening, around 7:30pm, I was able to eat a bland salad that didn&#39;t come back up. Today. 3/14/21, I am back to normal but my throat, stomach, and lower back are all sore from vomiting. I would NOT recommend this vaccine or get it again!

                                                Yesterday I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I was the last appointment, so they observed me for 5 minutes, and I left. After riding in the car for a few minutes, I noticed that I was having a hard time breathing and my throat felt like it was starting to swell. By that time, the clinic was closed, so I went to the emergency room just in case and sat in my car since they didn&#39;t allow people to sit in the waiting room because if covid.  It started becoming increasingly difficult to breathe, and I was feeling more and more swelling of my throat and tongue. I was having a lot of dizziness, nausea, facial flushing, palpitations, and some mild confusion. I then started getting numbness in the bottom half of my face. Over time, the numbness spread, mostly staying on the left side of my body (face, scalp, lower arms and legs, left side on tongue and inside of mouth). I also started getting a prickling burning pain sensation for brief periods of time where I had numbness. I had decided that if my breathing worsened at all, I would go to the er even though I can&#39;t afford it.   After about an hour and a half, my breathing started to feel less constricted and like there was less resistance. The swelling in my throat was mostly in the upper throat where I had difficulty swallowing but not as much difficulty breathing. The numbness continued to get worse and was sometimes disappearing and reappearing in the same spot.  At 9:30 pm we went to go get some benadryl. I continued feeling less and less swelling and having an easier time breathing. At that point, I went home. Once I was home, my breathing continued to improve and the numbness started to dissipate.  In the middle of the night, I started itching and getting widespread hives and getting a sharp burning pricking pain that would last a few seconds in different areas. The numbness also started coming back mostly in my face. I continued to have difficulty swallowing.  I am feeling much better today. I still feel some slight swelling in my throat when I swallow, but my breathing is fine. I&#39;m still itchy and occasionally breaking out in hives. Im having mild lower facial numbness. I&#39;m also starting to get the normal side effects of fever, headache, arm soreness, and body aches. I&#39;m taking benadryl every 4 hours.

                                                About a minute after I had the injection, my arm started hurting and it felt like hot water was coursing through my veins. I got an immediate headache that progressed into light headedness, my vision got blurry and I saw colors and then I started to lose my hearing, it felt like there was cotton in my ears. The nurses said I went pale and they called it a panic attack, but it was unlike any panic attack I have ever had in my life. I?ve had my TDAP updated a few years ago and got a flu shot and did not feel anything like this. I was rolled out of the room on a wheel chair because I was too dizzy to walk and then threw up several times into a bag and peed myself. It took about 20 minutes before I felt normal again.   The following day my arm felt numb and incredibly sore, I couldn?t raise it that far up without excruciating pain. I felt weak, fatigued and dizzy and was unable to use the bathroom. I had fever sweats and chills on and off. I was not able to sleep well, but I think that?s because of the pain in my arm.

My shoulder where the vaccine was injected was sore through Saturday, March 20th. I had muscle aches and weakness through Saturday, March 20th.

Woke up and was very weak (could not push toothpaste through toothpaste tube), almost passed out in trying, so I sat on the floor. Tried getting back to bed and was extremely nauseous and started vomiting. After that, I had the sweats/fever/chills for a couple hours (until ~11:00am), and was fatigued until 4:00 pm. Spent most of the day sleeping, unable to do anything. Today, 22Mar2021, feel slight tingling on palm of left hand and fingers. Injection site is still sore and bruised

                                                I did get sick that evening - I had a fever and chills. I did throw up. That lasted all night. The fever broke by the morning. But the exhausted next day - I went home from work early that day. Friday, I got a rash  - very itchy and sore  (it felt very tender when touched)- on my left side (abdomen). It spread around the left side on my back and to my stomach. I say my doctor on this Tuesday (virtual appt) said it was Shingles - Valtrex - to help it heal faster. The rash is starting to scab over and is peeling now.  It&#39;s getting better.

When I woke up in the morning I had a headache, muscle aches, slight difficulty breathing with chest heaviness, and fatigue.  At 2 am on March 8 I awoke with dizziness and room spinning, sweating, weakness and lightheadedness, and nausea. Later that morning most of the symptoms subsided except for slight lightheadedness. By March 9 all side effects had resolved.

Treated with iburprofen and odansetron at approximately 3:30 AM. Fever, nausea, and vomiting subsided due to medication. Muscle/joint pain remained at a lessened level. High levels of fatigue emerged in the early morning hours. Took sumatriptan for migraine at around noon and again later that evening. Fever resurfaced when ibuprofen wore off around noon. Had to leave work early due to fever, muscle/joint pain, and migraine. Took another dose of ibuprofen around that time and again in the evening. Fatigue lasted until approximately 48 hours later. All other symptoms subsided within 24 hours.

At around 9:00 PM I had chills, migraine, bodyaches, burning sensation in my joints, neck pain, and a low-grade fever. I took some Tylenol at around 7 PM. But the pain did not subside and I was able to use the bathroom the next day at around 4 AM and was still in severe pain. That day at around 1 PM I was able to set up and felt 30% better. On day two I am feeling better but I still have minor body aches I do get fatigue while doing light work around the house and no appetite and loss of taste is the newest symptom. I am not 100 percent better but close to it.

                                                I received the vaccine at 9am on Saturday, March 6th. My arm was immediately very sore throughout the day. Around 9:30pm that night I began to feel nauseous. As the night progressed my symptoms got worse. I experienced intense chills and by 11pm had a 100 degree fever. Sunday, March 7th my fever had decreased, but I continued to feel nauseous and have chills throughout the day. Additionally I felt extremely fatigued, weak, and had a throbbing headache. Completing simple tasks were difficult and exhausting. Monday, March 8th I continue to experience significant fatigue, headache, and muscle weakness, but at less intensity. Also, my right arm where I received the injection is very sore. I have also been somewhat dizzy today. I have been taking Advil, drinking fluids, using an ice pack, and resting as much as I can as part of the treatment.

                                                I had some sort of reaction to the vaccine about 1-2 minutes after receiving it, and it was super scary and they had to call the paramedics.   After the pharmacist injected me, I felt the arm pain right away. No big deal. I walked over to the chair to sit for my 15 minutes. I was happy to be vaccinated and kind of saw it as my mini booster for my immune system that already beat COVID-19. As I sat there, the only thing I could say is, I felt a tingling cold sensation moving from my arm through me. Almost like I could feel the vaccine moving through my system. The tingling kept moving and I thought to myself, okay cool. I guess it&#39;s working. Awesome. But then my head felt cold, I felt tingling in my head, my mouth tasted like metal, saliva started to build in my mouth, I started to sweat, I felt overly sweaty all over my body, but my head felt cold and tingly.   I was staring straight ahead and everything started to go staticky, like a television set, and the static began to build and started to get starry. Everything in my vision started to fade. So I spoke out to say something weird was happening.  A man came over to talk to me and hold me up. He kept saying stuff but then my ears started ringing and I couldn&#39;t hear him anymore. I began to fade out as the stars got more intense. Then, as if it was just a mini reboot, my brain started to come back online and the picture in front of me began to fade back into view. I felt nauseous and still had a super metal taste in my mouth. They called the paramedics to give me a checkup. The metal taste in my mouth stayed the longest, but after about 45 minutes I felt well enough to go home.  On and off, I have this intense tingling inside my brain. It reminds me of a time when I was in the hospital on morphine. Just a tingling pins and needles sensation inside my head. Other than that, I am okay now. But I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s some sort of reaction because I already had COVID-19.

When I woke up two hours later I was freezing cold and my body was very achy. I ended up sleeping the rest of the day and night. On Friday I felt fine most of the day until about 10pm at night when I started having diarrhea. Throughout the night it got worse and my body got very hot to the point where I had to sleep naked with fans on me. I?m lightly short of breath, exhausted, and am still having diarrhea now (Sat).

                                                About 25 minutes after receiving the shot, I suddenly felt weak and dizzy. My vision started to go dark. I broke out into a cold sweat all over my body and could barely see anything or move my body and I felt very nauseous. I was nearly unconscious and barely able to talk. This lasted for about 20 minutes and then slowly started to recede after that. I felt able to stand after about 40 minutes, and was eventually able to walk out of the store and be driven home.   I am very very healthy and have no major medical conditions.

Injection site was hot to the touch and did swell a bit. The following day I went through strong waves of feeling very ill and then feeling ok for about an hour, then back to having chills, nauseous, headache, body ache, and extremely lethargic. Half way through second day I broke out in a rash all over my chest, tummy, and back. Entering into day 3 ( today ) I do feel better, but can&#39;t shake the brain fog and feelings of being tired. Rash is still present currently.

                                                After getting it I went home and slept about 3 hours and woke up with fever of 99.3. Had a pounding headache that Tylenol nor ibuprofen could relieve. Body began to ache to the point I was in tears. Checked fever again and was at 99.9. Took more Tylenol and Ibuprophen and went to bed as much as I could. Woke up and took Tylenol the next morning. Checked temperature because I still had a pounding headache and was at 100.2, started sweating and shaking as in cold sweats. No appetite. Spent most of the day resting with most symptoms still accruing. On 3rd day I have no fever. I?m not as weak and I?m able to get around a lot better. Still a little nauseous but definitely feeling better then the previous days.

                                                About 6 hours after injection, I felt incredibly exhausted. After 12 hours, nausea and headache set in. 13-14 hours, a terrible stomachache and diarrhea. My skin felt so sensitive that it hurt to touch. Zofran treated the nausea. The day after the injection I was exhausted, was nauseous and had a headache. 48 hours after injection I woke up with a strange headache. I could look to the right pain free, but if I looked to the left or left/up, I had a piercing pain near my right eye. Excedrin/Tylenol did not relieve this headache. On Hour 72, the headache is still present, though to a lesser degree.

I had seasonal allergies occurring that day, so I kept eating a bit longer. My tongue then started tingling. I took a dose of Children&#39;s Benadryl (all I had for Benadryl at the time). I then waited about 10 minutes before I felt my throat starting to close. We headed straight to emergency room (5 mins away). By the time I got there, I started to have a little trouble taking breaths. When I got into the trauma room moments later, I became nauseous and dry heaving.  They gave me an epinephrine shot, Benadryl, Pepto, and Prednisone.   They watched me for a few hours before release. Upon discharge, they provided me a prescription for epi-pens, famotidine, prednisone, and fexofenadine (5-day prescriptions).

By 5pm my temperature was at 99 degrees F and by 7pm, my temperature was 100 degrees F. My muscles on my back, neck and legs were painful. I had no problems drinking liquids. I refrained from Tylenol until about 7pm, I had 1000mg. I slept for 8 hours and woke up with no fever but the muscle aches have reduced by about 50%.

                                                starting at 11:00 PM day of vaccine, I started to feel nauseous, chills, aches all over, extreme exhaustion / tired, and headache. The symptoms worsened through the night, unable to sleep. Sometimes the chills would turn to fever and extreme sweating and burning hot sensations. The symptoms were the worst on Thursday and lessened slightly with each passing day. The illness stayed until Sunday morning.

First day after felt slightly better, still tired and slightly light headed. Second day symptoms worsened, feeling like I was going to pass out/faint, hot/cold chills, clammy, no fever, shortness of breath, culminating in numbness and tingling in arms, legs, then chest and then hands freezing up which resulted in a panic attack. Have never had a panic attack before. Emergency services called and after checking gave a sedative and went to the ER.

                                                She got the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine at Yankee stadium. Roughly 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine, she started to feel nauseous, develop crampy abdominal pain, and feel lightheaded. She went home and took a shower and lay down in bed. When she got up she again felt nauseous and dizzy. She threw up a total of 6 times, none of which were bloody. She had several episodes of diarrhea throughout the day. Given her ongoing symptoms she presented to the ED.   On arrival, she was febrile to 39.5C, and tachycardic to 145 with BP 98/56 and SpO2 100% on room air. She was given zofran, 1L NS, and tylenol. On repeat, her BP was 75/35 (though no longer tachycardic). She was written for 2 more liters of NS and then endorsed to medicine. Her BP improved w/ SBP in the 90s-110s with continued myalgias, headaches.

                                                The night of 3/9/21  following the vaccination I had fever, chills, sweating, severe body aches and pains (all over) and nightmares Wednesday morning I was unable to go to work and remained in bed sleeping all but approximately 2 hours in the afternoon  because I was still in pain and had headache/fever/chills/muscle and joint pain. I also had no appetite. I was awake long enough to eat one bowl of cereal and a small apple sauce cup so that I could take more meds without upsetting my stomach. Wednesday night 3/10 my temperature was still at 99.3. I was still having body soreness and headaches (sinus). Thursday morning 3/11 I still had the headache and body soreness but no more fever. I was still feeling unwell but could at least get out of bed and function. By late Thursday most of the symptoms subsided and I started feeling better. Friday morning I was no longer having symptoms.  It was the initial symptoms Tuesday night and Wednesday that concerned me the most because it hit me so severely and fast. The pharmacist warned me of possible side effects that would require over the counter medication, but in my case that did not suffice. I was physically unable to do anything but sleep which is highly unusual for me, and my entire body was in more pain than I?ve ever experienced.

Following that I had a headache, nausea, flu like symptoms, body aches, and a fever. Missed 2 days of work. My symptoms from the vaccine were worse than when I had the COVID virus.

They eventually after monitoring me for awhile sent me down to ER, by then my voice was raspy and scratchy, my lower lip was big, my tongue still felt big. I still felt nauseous. The dr asked me if my eyes are usually swollen and red and I said no. My extremities were still numb and tingling. I got epi and other drugs, zofran, benadryl, pepcid, I think a dose of steroids. The symptoms continued so I ended up getting a 2nd dose of epi. I went home around 5pm. When I woke up that evening to do a neb treatment I was nauseous, my lower lip again big, my tongue felt thick and this time my upper throat felt swollen, I gave myself epi and took myself to ER, they monitored me for 3 hrs the dr was gonna hospitalize me if I got worse, I still felt nauseous and the numbness and tingling feeling in my hands and feet when I left but was not having any airway issues when I left. Not sure if the numbness/tingly is gonna go away in my hands and feet.

This rapidly turned into skin tingling, violent shivers and shaking throughout the body followed by burning hot fever. Once this passed, at about 2:00am, nausea began and mild vomiting. After that, exhaustion set in and loss of appetite. The exhaustion and lack of appetite lasted until about 8pm on Saturday - about 28 hours post-vaccine. However, vomiting occurred again at midnight that night as well about 34 hours post-vaccine.

                                                started with drowsiness and no appetite, chills came on but nothing serious but within 1 hour the chills became very intense and I couldnt  warm up or take it. I had sweatpants, two sweatshirts, slippers and 2 blankets on to help. Later on I had fallen asleep to wake my husband to uncontrollable laughter and crying, mentally I knew what I was doing was not right but I couldn&#39;t control it. I believe my feve may had spiked so high that it was border line hysteria. By morning I woke and the fever had broke however I still had no appetite, terrible headache along with weakness and fatigue....I also tried food but ended up spitting it out because everything tasted strongly of metal. Sunday I was back to tasting to food and more energy.

By 6:30pm, I was down for the count with the cold sweats, diarrhea, headache and vertigo like symptoms (dizzy when standing or moving). Tylenol was taken for fever and water and Gatorade is all that was drank for the remainder of the night. When awaking around 8am the next morning,  fever was gone as well as chills. headache and dizziness remained. Around 1pm, toast and oatmeal was eaten and started feeling more normal again. by 5pm was fine, just tired and sore still.

Saturday I felt achy and a little unsteady when I got up or walked around (these reactions I expected). Sunday morning I woke up covered head to toe in hives that lasted for three days. I have never had hives so bad before. I called the pharmacy and was instructed to take Benedryl which didn&#39;t work. I took Allegra on Tuesday which seemed to help clear them up by the end of the day.

                                                36 y.o. female referred for the above chief complaint.   She has no significant medical history and presented with a headache that became severe 3 days ago.  She received the Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine on March 25th and had a mild headache following that which she attributed to the vaccine.  3 days ago the pain became excruciating and was associated with vomiting.  This prompted presentation to the ED where she was treated with Dilaudid. She was discharged home and has been using her mom&#39;s headache cocktail with some transient relief.  She presented back to the ED today with continued symptoms.  MRV revealed a venous sinus thrombosis and neurology was therefore consulted.   She has no history of clots personally or in the family.  Her dad did have a stroke in his 50s.  Patient otherwise denies any other associated speech change, vision change, extremity numbness, extremity weakness, coordination difficulty, or dizziness. Patient admitted to the neurology ICU and started on anticoagulation.

                                                I got the shot Saturday afternoon. My side effects started around 9:30 with chills?I just couldn?t get warm. I drifted off to sleep all right around 10:30, but by midnight, my legs were on fire like I?d just run a marathon. I?m pretty sure I had a fever because I was sweating and tossing and turning for what seemed like hours. By 4:00, I had a massive headache and felt like I was going to throw up. I took Advil and Zofran at 4 and went back to bed. Sunday I still battled headache, aches, and fatigue. The fatigue is what&#39;s still lingering yesterday and today.

                                                Symptoms began later in the same day the vaccine was received. Fever was between 100-102 for about 48 hours from symptom onset, and had significant joint pain in all joints, but especially knees. Major fatigue but unable to sleep because of intensity and discomfort of symptoms. Outbreak of new aphthous ulcers in mouth. Contacted physician to ask if I could take acetaminophen or ibuprofen to lower fever and get relief from joint pain - was advised both were safe to use. Took acetaminophen. Major symptoms resolved after 48 hours, but some general fatigue, loss of appetite, and night sweats continued for approximately 1 week post-vaccine.

The red spot  has grown to the size of 5 inches  in diameter. Slight nausea the first day of injection. Along with genera malaise.

I put an ice pack on my head because it feels swollen and there?s a lot of pressure that it?s painful. This morning I tried to eat crackers so I could take ibuprofen but I threw up immediately. I?m currently still experiencing a lot of head pain/ache and nausea and muscle tightness.

                                                I went to a community event (held at a church) for the COVID vaccine. After the vaccine, I wanted the 15 minutes and felt ok - just hot. I went out to my car and over the next few minutes - I was getting hotter - My face was extremely hot and flushed, and hives started developing on my arms and chest. They were burning and itching; my skin was hot to the touch. My chest felt tight and my throat felt swollen, but I was able to breathe (breathe felt a little short, but I was able to take a full breathe). I was also dizzy and felt nauseous. I went to the ER, where they treated me for anaphylaxis with Benadryl, Pepcid, Breathing treatment, and a steroid. After about an hour or so I felt fine, and the dr gave me some medications to take over the next few days.

                                                I took the J&amp;J shot roughly at 11:50a, and naturally felt the immediate burn, and swear I felt the liquid moving through my arm. My arm was immediately tingly and numb simultaneously, and I felt...light and weird. Around 2p, I began feeling feeling lightheaded and weak, and at 6p, I had chills, severe weakness, dizziness and nausea. I couldn&#39;t stand up longer than 2 minutes without wanting to vomit and faint. I couldn&#39;t even stand up long enough to wash dishes, prepare a bowl of grapes to eat or shower. Throughout the night, I sweated so terribly from the chills to the point that my bed was soaked to the mattress pad, and currently at 2:02p on April 6th, I&#39;m still experiencing the extreme weakness, nausea, and chills.

                                                Approximately 9 hours after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA, I experienced sudden fatigue followed by onset of severe muscle and joint pain including severe head pain followed by severe chills followed by fever and excessive sweating. I was very dizzy and felt disoriented. I was in bed when all this happened and was already wearing warm clothes under the covers. The muscle and joint pain was so severe, I couldn&#39;t grip anything including my cell phone (my wrists were in sharp pain). The head pain was so severe I was sensitive to light regardless of how dim it was. I felt like my toes were curled, but that could have been me &#34;bracing&#34; and tightening up due to the total body pain. I could move very little. It was very strange. These symptoms persisted through the night. The following morning at around 9am, I still had a very bad headache that made me nauseated and continued to be sensitive to light. Some of the joint and muscle pain tapered down enough for me to get out of bed to go potty but it was exhausting to walk 5 feet to the bathroom and then get back in bed. I still ran a mild fever. At around 1pm I took a Tylenol that helped subside the symptoms but felt wiped out all day. By the following day (Monday), I was feeling better getting more energy and by that Monday evening, I felt like nothing ever happened. I&#39;m sure these just fall into perhaps the more severe level of the side effects, but I was frightened by the intense sharp muscle and joint pain to the point I couldn&#39;t even grip anything.

I got home and had the worst headache I&#39;ve ever had and felt flu like symptoms and very weak. The next day at work I was so sick I had to go home. I was puking and had diarrhea  over and over for a few hours. I also felt lightheaded and dizzy and weak. Also had the headache. I was getting chills as well once I got home.

Because it would make me more nauseated.  Terrible headache I fell asleep earlier in the afternoon I had to hold my Stomach and even turning in bed led to more nausea.  Finally fell asleep  dor the night woke up so far today I don?t feel nauseated I do feel dehydrated and I tried to drink Gatorade but drinking  from a cup aggravates it so only like ice chips or popsicles don?t aggravate my stomach    I felt like I was dying just laying on the floor for hours I laid on the. Ahg room floor because the tile was cool and I was near the toilet.  I tested positive for covid asymptomatic in October and then positive again in December with mild symptoms.  I never fully regained sense of smell or taste only partially even though that was months ago.  I wouldn?t wish that vaccine reaction in anyone   I was hesitant sins with already had covid to get vaccinated but was encouraged to do so.  I definitely won?t do that again ever.  It wasn?t that bad actually having COVID that was way worse.

                                                Immediately began to feel a headache, dizzy and nauseated.  The doctor on site had me lie down on the floor. Was starting to feel better so was able to sit up in a chair for about 15 minutes. Another wave of dizziness and nausea came over and was lying on the floor again. It was hard to breathe, but oxygen and HR were good. The doctor tried to give me juice to see if it was my blood sugar going low, but afterward, I still felt dizzy and nauseated. It was still hard to breathe. It felt like something was sitting on my chest. BP was elevated, oxygen levels were good, HR was good but I started to get a cold chill where my teeth were chattering. At that point (about 45 min to an hour) the symptoms had not gone away and the ambulance was called. Was transported to the local hospital where I received a liter of saline and Zofran for nausea.  BP was high, but oxygen levels and HR were good. The heart monitor showed no signs of arrhythmia or tachycardia so I was discharged. The doctor believes it was a side effect and not an allergic reaction.

I fainted at table, then my spouse didn&#39;t know when he came downstairs, he thought my head was just resting at the table. He asked if I wanted to walk to the couch to rest, and as he helped me do so, I fainted and he caught me and carried me to the couch. Recovered within 1 minute but my hearing was  fuzzy for a couple more minutes, sounded like static in my ears.  Other reactions were:  Standard ones I read could happen- Fever of 100.1 that lasted less than a day, chills, aches, warm feeling and fatigue.

Woke up 20 min later, chills and body symptoms continued to worsen. Got very bad, could not get off the couch, in lots of pain. Nausea started. Light headache, Lasted for about 6 hours until I decided to take Tylenol and a bath. This helped immensely! After the bath I got very warm, burning up. Slept some and the next day felt significantly better. Light body aches and headache, tired. Back to almost 100% two days later/48 hrs.

                                                Starting in the afternoon after my shot I started feeling extremely cold. I had chills and my teeth were actually chattering at one point it was so bad. This gradually got worse as the evening went on. With it I also started feeling weak and fatigued. By 8pm I started to have a headache. Throughout the night symptoms worsened and I had a fever and more serious headache. My head was pounding so badly. I couldn&#39;t sleep at all. I also had a couple hot flashes to where I woke up sweating. Then I would feel frozen again. The nausea started during the night too. I thought I would throw up but didn&#39;t. At one point my heart was racing so fast I was a little concerned something bad would happen to me and contemplated going to the hospital. By morning I felt a little better, still nauseous and with a bad headache. My body was a little weak. These symptoms lasted all day Thursday. By that Friday morning I only had a little weakness and slight headache. By mid day Friday I was pretty much back to normal.

There were no immediate side effects present, other than soreness at the injection site. Approximately 17 hours after the vaccination, the following symptoms started: nausea, malaise, fever (102.3), chills, headache, and lower back pain.

                                                Shortly after the vaccine on the drive home the injection site got super hot, the arm began to swell and turn red.  I developed a fever and my sinuses got really stuffy.  I began to throw up profusely which made all symptoms from other issues occur causing me to swell all over and because I couldnt take any meds or keep anything down I went to the ER.   While there I began wheezing and experiencing SOB which still is an issue today.  I have foggy moments where my brain seems so foggy that I am having issues with my short term memory.  I was administered IV fluids, IV morphine and IV ibuphropen to help with the symptoms and was hospitalized for less than a day further evaluation

                                                Approx 12 after shot I woke up feeling very ill and nauseous. As I walked to the restroom to vomit I lost 100% of my vision, I became very disoriented and had the loudest screeching in both ears. I screamed for my husband and I caught me as I was taken to the floor with no mobility. The episode last several minutes before he was able to move me back to bed. I had severe sweating and ear ringing. As I report this I still have a lingering brain fog and ear ringing.  I reported it to my physician and told to go to the ER if any reoccurrence of reaction.

                                                I have a history of anaphylaxis, and disclosed that to the medics so they watched me more carefully, which was good, as while I did not experience anything that severe, I did immediately get itchy, turn red and feel quite nauseated. However,  after they monitored me awhile, I told them I felt okay to go home. The next day I had the expected mild flu-like symptoms, which I anticipated. However, what?s been atypical is they returned tenfold three days later. This time with a much higher fever (103), severe chills, fatigue, a seemingly never-ending headache,  muscle spasms,  chest palpitations and suddenly I am experiencing asthma (which is typically seasonal) and am coughing, too.  I?m now a week past when I was vaccinated and each day was feel worse, not better. I have had to cancel my clients and hire a sitter to care for my kids as I am too weak and ill to do it.  I looked up common reactions and nothing states chest pain and/or asthma, nor that it should last this long. That said, as I am high-risk, I work from home and homeschool both of my young kids. Thus, I have been nowhere aside from the vaccine site. Moreover, my partner, our kids and sitter get routinely tested for me,  and everyone is negative. Thus, it appears I am having prolonged, heightened side-effects much more intense than the ?mild? flu-like symptoms otherwise reported, which is concerning. I took no medication prior to receiving the vaccine, either.

                                                Nausea and headache within a minute of vaccination, then after going home began to feel fatigued and achy. By 7-8 hours after receiving the shot, I started noticing a fever. Had a fever of 102 all night along with chills, extreme body aches, and headache. Temperature stayed between 100.5 and 101.5 all day today (the day after the vaccine), and the body aches and general feeling of being unwell are still being experienced. I am guessing my immune system is reacting to the vaccine and hopefully the symptoms will subside soon. I have not reached out to my doctor at this time.

About 30 mins to an hour later I notice that every move I make, the joints I&#39;m moving hurt. Like EVERY joint is now sore when I move. (With the exception of fingers/toes) I tossed and turned all night and got a headache. The queasiness was very mild, but happened any time I moved.  This morning now my joints no longer hurt, but I still have the headache.
