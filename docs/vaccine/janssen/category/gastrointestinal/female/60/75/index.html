                                                Eight hours after the shot, I quickly became very chilled with total body aches and pains and extremely tired.  My mouth became very dry.  This lasted most of the night.  The next morning approaching 24 hours after the shot, the initial side effects were gone but I then had a headache and a bit of nausea.  Again was extremely tired and pretty much rested all day.  All side effects were gone the next day.  I felt no need to call my healthcare provider and did not take any over the counter pain medication.

Went to bed and became extremely cold - teeth chattering, chills and fever at 11:30pm - approx. 8 1/2 hours after injection.  After that vomiting, soreness, headache body aches, fever of 100 degrees.  When awaking the next morning, still had fever of 99.8, chills, nausea, headache.  Finally felt like myself by 3pm on Tuesday, March 16.   I am not a chronic complainer.  After receiving my flu shots every year for many years, this was the first reaction I&#39;ve ever had to any immunization - ever.

I felt like I hit a wall. My body just ached. I took some Ibuprofen and continued my shift. I woke up the next day with a headache so bad that I couldn&#39;t lift my head off of the pillow. I took Tylenol and that continued the entire day. I stayed in bed all day. The next night, I woke up in the middle of the night with chills, but no temperature. The following Monday, I still had the chills along with nausea. By Tuesday, I felt normal again.

                                                Approximately, 11 hours after the shot Severe cold chills, so severe my teeth would not stop chattering. I was shaking so hard my body ached from shaking. Goosebumps, a crazy headache.  I thought i was having an anurysm.  Not a normal headache.  Cold sweats so bad you could just about wring out my sheets and clothes. Nausea, some vomiting.  On a scale of 1-10 of these symptoms is was an 11-12.  These symptoms changed as the days went on.  In the moring of the first night.  I was ok.  Woke up with a bad headache, still nauseas and still cold but not like at night tollerable.  About 5PM day 2 it started all over again, just as severe.  Next moring ok.  This pattern kept reapeating for 4 days.  Food now getting repulsive.  No way I  could eat anything.  On day 5 the symptoms continue now throug the day, however the teeth chattering not happeing and the cold chills a bit less severe.  I would say by day 5 on the scale of 1-10 i am now about a 9. This was so horrible for so long.  Every single night i would wake up soaked in my own sweat.  This is still happening 11 days later.  I am still experiencing headaches.  I never have headaches.  I did not go to a Doctor because i figured what are they going to do, i have to ride this out.  Also a strange thing is took my temparture daily and seveal times.  Zero temprature. by day 5 I could not get out of bed for 3 days.  Day 8 things getting better, still cold chills and headaches but not as bad.  Day 9 way better, now getting hungry. Daytime cold chills now gone mostly less headaches.  Oddly headaches and cold chills start about 4-5pm and continue through the night.  In the morning i wake up with a headache still today.

I checked her blood pressure, which registered as 80/60.  I offered to call 911, due to hypotension, but when I checked it on her other arm, it was 177/87, which she confirmed was closer to her baseline.  Additionally, she complained of nausea and vomited.  I then offered to call 911 again, but she said that she was feeling better.  I continued to monitor her, and offered to call an ambulance again,  She did not complain of any difficulty breathing or chest tightness/pain. I continued to monitor her for twenty minutes, and then she said that she wanted to go home.  I offered to call an ambulance again, but she assured me that she felt better and wanted to go home.

I got in my car to go home from a friends house and started severe chills and called Doctor for fear of heart attack. They told me to go to ER. I continued driving home. Chills got worse. I got in shower with heater on and chills persisted. Drank coconut water and heart palpitations resided.  Got in bed and fever spiked to 102 and every bone was inflamed in pain. Nyquil did nothing. After a few hours of severe and unbearable pain I called ER. Headed over to ER at 3:00 a.m. and sat in parking lot. Fever broke at 3:00 a.m. which was hour 14 after vaccine. Other than severe nausea, pain calmed down. Drove home with Tylenol. Took 1,000 mg and finally rested at 4:00 a.m. Woke up at 8:00 a.m. with nausea but pain gone. 24 hours from vaccine, most of the reaction gone. 48 hours out body normal but pain in injection site.

Took 2 Tylenol every 4-6 hours to help the headache. It lasted until Sunday morning. My nose felt stuffy when I woke up Sunday morning at which time there was blood in my nose. The rest of the day it was clear but a small amount appeared Monday morning as well. Both sides of my temples are sore to the touch as if they were bruised. Other than that and being weak the other symptoms are gone.

I had periods of nausea and dizzy spells for the following week. I had an extreme migrane the night of the shot and chills throughout the next week. I did not report the symptoms to  anyone because I had not heard that these were reactions to this vaccine. After I heard that others were experiencing similar symptoms, I felt I should report my experience.

                                                Developed heart palpitations approximately 10 hours after receiving vaccine. Also insomnia  making it impossible to sleep.  Palpitations seemed to get better by 11 am the next morning but my heart rate was still elevated ( pulse 106-112).  Shortly after that ( around 11:45 am) I became extremely light headed and dizzy and felt like I was going to pass out. I also started to feel nauseous and sweaty.   I rested lying down for two hours before hearing back from my doctor&#39;s office.  I was able to control the lightheadedness and dizziness by lying down. The feeling of passing out / nearly fainting went away.  I continued to feel nauseous and my  heartrate was still elected. I started to get a headache as well.  On the advise of a nurse at my doctor&#39;s office,  my husband took me to the ER.  My EKG was normal . My heartrate was elevated.  Due to the overcrowding at the ER that day I was made to wait at least an hour and half for further evaluation.  I continued to feel light headed and slightly dizzy. My nausea and headache got much worse .  I was finally taken back to a treatment room and received IV fluids, Zofran and Tylenol.  My heartrate went back to normal and my headache and nausea improved with treatment and I was discharged around 7pm.  I continued to feel very tired and slightly lightheaded that evening. The next morning  I was much more nauseous again and still very weak feeling and slightly lightheaded. I have  continued to feel weak, very fatigued , unwell and nauseous on and off until today, April 14, which is 6 days after I was vaccinated.

                                                4/11/21  (evening)  - Headache.  Called doctor on Monday. Took 1 aspirin with doctor&#39;s approval and was fine.  5/4/21 (approximately 1 a.m.)  Awoke feeling nauseous. Went to bathroom and proceeded to vomit four times over the next 90 minutes. Last episode was just vomiting water that I&#39;d sipped and could not hold down.  No sore throat, fever, chills or diarrhea. Just vomiting.  Able to handle crackers, ginger tea &amp; ginger beer. Plan to try soup today. Still more tired than normal (though 16-18 hour workdays don&#39;t help here), and stomach still feels a little unsettled.  5/4/21 - Present - Headache. Afraid to take aspirin as it might upset stomach that has already had a tough time.   NOTE: Regarding question on next page about adverse reactions to vaccines, I haven&#39;t had a vaccine since childhood. My parents, who were typically never sick, became terribly ill for months after receiving their first and only flu vaccine. One of my sister&#39;s had a similar reaction. For that reason, my other sister and I have never opted for vaccines in adulthood, until now. I just took it now because I don&#39;t want to die, my employer is pushing for us to return to campus, and I know my high school students will not vaccinate or wear masks if they can avoid it.

My life partner started calling my name and check my pulse (which he said was strong) ; then I came to but was really dizzy; I was nauseous and vomited for a few minutes; extremely hot/sweating; and after I stopped vomiting, then had a bowel movement (He had to aid me in getting to the bathroom).   About 20 - 25 minutes later I felt much better; everything calmed down.  I was ultimately able to fall back to sleep.

Woke on Friday  3/19/21 with fatigue and diarrhea with body aches.  Woke Saturday 3/20/21 with fever 101.7. (During this duration to include today I have  taken Tylenol rotating with Motrin every 2 hours, this never broke my fevers). Fever continues on and off with body aches, nausea, the worst headache I have ever experienced and pain in the base back of my neck L side.  These symptoms have continued since Saturday.  It is now Friday, 3/26/21.  I will say that during waking hours 8am - 10pm on Wednesday 3/24/21 and Thursday 3/25/21 I had no symptoms except absolute fatigue.  The fever returned on those two nights at around midnight with it breaking about 4 am, waking up in a pile of sweat.

Day 5 very tired despite adequate sleep. Mild diarrhea. Symptoms not bad enough to keep me home from work, but I thought it odd symptoms didn&#39;t begin to appear until 4 days after vaccine.

In the morning it seemed getting better but then my symptoms got worse.  I took two Ibuprofen which helped. I still continued to feel tired. After my vaccine, I also got a weird taste in my mouth. I was very tired over the weekend. My armpit itched and so I scratched it and I felt raised bumps under my armpit, under the pit of my arms on both sides, right greater than left. My left arm was the one vaccinated. I also had bad diarrhea on 03-29-2021. Today I still continue with the rash under my armpits and still feel very tired and fatigued.

I went to the ER and they gave me fluids. I was told it was a reaction to the vaccine, but my paperwork said upper respiratory infection. My cough started out dry, I had SOB, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea and joint pain. My PCP put me on a steroid and an antibiotic Keflex (500mg, 3 times a day). I get lightheaded just walking around the house. I&#39;m still experiencing SOB, fatigue and the cough. Today is the first day that I could get up an move around. I&#39;m fine when I first wake up, but I eventually feel depleted.

Ibuprofen did not help. I was so tired, I could not move. It lasted through the night and would wake me up. I slept most of the next day until about 1:00pm.  I finally began to feel better about 12 hours after it began and within 24 hours I was back to normal other that the sore shoulder.

                                                The next morning, 09:00 am, I had mild flu symptoms which was full body aches and feeling feverish and unwell. I didn&#39;t register a fever on the thermometer. I was very tired; no appetite. I stayed resting all day. Slept a lot. It was easy for me to sleep - very unusual. By 9:00 pm that all lifted and I was feeling back to normal. The morning of March 28, I woke up with a very sore throat. And on 3/29, I had really continued sore throat on and off and Tuesday it got much worse. There was a really strange sensation of being extremely thirsty - I had never had experienced that before. Swollen gland on the right side of my throat - between the jaw and ear area. I had a little bit of an earache on the right side. I drove by the drive-in testing area. I am working in person each day so I get the drive by testing - I think Tuesday, the 30th. Called the dr and did the Telehealth visit - Wednesday - the 31st. I had in and out of laryngitis - raspy voice and headache. I looked in my throat with flashlight and could see a definitive red spot in back of throat and some white spots.  They said it could be a blocked salivary gland and told me to eat something very sour to activate it. Over 6 to 8 hours it did clear the issue somewhat - thirst went away. I still had a sore throat. They told me that by the weekend, I could maybe start antibiotic. Saturday night I took first dose of Zpack - two tablets at first dose and then one tablet a day after that. By late evening Sunday (Easter) I felt some relief of symptoms. This week I still have a little bit of raspy voice and post nasal drip and clearing my throat at this point. I am recovering but not fully recovered.

                                                Beginning approximately 10 PM (about 8 hours post-injection), I started to have chills (feet were freezing) and was exhausted. Went to bed, and slept most of the night, only waking once to urinate and to drink a small amount (approx 2 oz) of Coca Cola -- I was very nauseous and thought it would help settle my stomach. During the night I sweated profusely. At 8 AM,  I woke again and went to urinate. At that time I felt very nauseous, dizzy, and light headed. When I walked about 2 -3 feet to my bedroom, I collapsed on the floor - unconscious. My partner called EMS, they arrived minutes later. By then I was conscious. They transported me to Medical Center Emergency Room, where I remained for several hours. They indicated that my SYNCOPE was a result of dehydration. TODAY, 4/13, news of BLOOD CLOTS has compelled me to report my adverse reaction.

On 4/9/2021, I started to feel a pulsating feeling on my upper head and felt anxiety. It felt like I could not reduce my stress by taking deep breaths and letting it out slowly which was unusual because this usually works.

                                                Right after shot, did not feel anything that morning till around 5pm I started to feel feverish, headache, tired.  My arm never got sore or swollen.  AFter 5pm till, the feverish feeling and hot cold got worse as time went by and I started shaking uncontrollably - pretty severe.  I took Tylenol early hoping to stop the achy feverish and shaking but did not seem to help.  THis went to till about 1am or 2am when I could finally lay down and try to sleep.  The shaking had stopped.  I did take more Tylenol and drank some herbal chamole type of hot tea.  I could not sleep that night.  Next day I was exhausted, body aches and still had some feverish feeling.  By the way, took my temperature and it was normal.  Then on Wednesday, I believe is when I had a huge episode of diarrhea (came on sudden).  I kept calling and talking virtually to the doctor telling him all of what was going on.  The next day I the feverish feeling and body aches and being tired kept happening  - adding headache getting worse.  I kept taking Tylenol.  Seem to help some but did not take the pain away. EAch night , I could not sleep due to the headache.  I started to feel better but then on the weekend, I had that headache and tired feeling.  The headache was getting stronger and it circled my whole head and both shoulder and around my neck.  It scared me because I felt at times that my throat was getting smaller.  I could still swallow but it was so strange.  I kept putting heat packs and ice packs and taking Tyelnol.  I know that on Thursday or Friday the week, the doctor told me if I wanted to to go get tested for Covid and I did.  I was tested negative on both the quick test and the other test that takes longer.     I had that headache, sinus tension pressure for quite a few more days.  Overall it took 7 days. I had to take off  most of the week from my telework job because I could not function.  I also did not eat much and drank lots of water during this time.  It seem to go away and then about a week later, I got this painful diarrhea out of the blue and went to see an urgent care doctor.  They tested me for blood, urine, and stool and they were negative.  I was also having pain on my left side.  Then it seem to go away after I was on the BRAT diet for a few more days.  Then the diarrhea happened again the next week or so.  This week, as of yesterday, I got a very strange throbbing pain in my left hand and not sure where that came from.  It can be extreme at times.  I tool Tyleonol but the pain is still there.  Also, during this time and before the shot, I got a trigger finger issue on my right index finger.  I don&#39;t think that has anything to do with the vaccine.  Please note I have been told my doctors and I know this for a fact, my body is super sensitive to food, meds.  I don&#39;t usually get the flu shot because of that.  Today I am experiencing the left hand pain and now metal tasting in my mouth.  I am about 5 weeks out from the vaccine.  I wish I had never taken it.  I pray nothing more will happen  in my body  If I have left anything off it is because I did not write this down when was happening.  I really thought I was going to die one night because of the pressure I was having in my head, neck and shoulders.   I have a little bit of a headache now and told my PT doctor that if I needed to know, I could get a brain or some kind of scan to see if I am hainvg any issues. I am going to bring this up to my virtual call today.

                                                Whether the adverse events were caused by the vaccine is to be determined.  We are available to discuss more details if this information can be used to help others from experiencing these reactions.  The morning after getting the vaccine, patient discovered that she could not swallow.  As her condition worsened, she was taken to the emergency room.  Over the past month, patient went to the emergency room 4 times.  The last time resulted in extended hospitalization that continues to this day.  In addition to the swallowing problem, two other major adverse events need to highlighted.  First, on 27 March, while in the hospital, vaginal bleeding started.  On 29 March, her doctor, performed a hysteriscopy/DNC finding &#34;  &#34;an unexplained blood clot (hematoma).&#34;  The second major event was when patient demonstrated significant confusion and lack of memory.  On 7 April, she was diagnosed with Metabolic Encephalopathy.  Neurologists at the hospital suspected that her MS was reacting to her UTI and once the infection is eliminated her memory should come back.  But as of 10 April, she was still having issues including hallucinations.  Although she is eating some as of 13 April, she is still very weak and will likely by moved from the Hospital to a rehab facility.  She still does not remember much of the last 37 days.

Patient reports that she felt lightheaded after the vaccine when she was leaving. She got home and felt better but then that night woke up in a delirium which passed by the morning. She had some weakness in her extremities, brain fog, cold feeling, funny GI feeling and fatigue for 3 days and then was fine.   Two weeks ago she started to feel that the circulation in her lower legs was cut off with sensation of blood pooling in her legs with associated numbness and tingling. She describes it as what you feel when a tourniquet is applied to your arm.  No visible lower extremity swelling, redness and no pain.    One week ago she felt like her right hand was not working well and then left hand too. She then felt pooling in her arms like the sensation in her legs.No swelling, redness or pain.   She reports she did a hand stand and afterward felt pooling sensation in her lower abdomen which has since resolved but continues to have a prickling sensation that comes and goes.   Last night while lying on her back she felt the pooling sensation in her chest and this morning throbbing in head and chest and neck. That is when she decided to come in and be seen.    Patient denies severe headache, backache, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, bruises, unusual bleeding or rashes.   Patient has not had a physical exam with blood work since 11/9/17.

                                                My sister, received the J &amp; J vaccine on March 5th.  I now know that she was not feeling well for a few days afterwards.  She then felt better until day nine after the vaccine.  On the evening of the ninth day,  she began having abdominal pain, vomiting &amp; diarrhea, headache. This was Sunday evening.  Unfortunately I wasn?t aware of how she was feeling and she didn?t go to the emergency rm. until Tuesday morning.  Tests determined her platelet level was low and abdominal CT showed bleeding from her adrenal glands.  She was given platelets, pain meds and admitted into the hospital.  Later that night staff felt she wasn?t responsive and a head CT was performed.  It was determined she had a brain hemorrhage and emergency surgery was performed. It is my understanding that there was brain damage at that point.  During the early morning hours of the 10th day, post surgery, a repeat CT scan was done showing more hemorrhaging and blood clots. She also developed a  DVT and PE and was kept on a respirator until the 13th day post vaccine to allow family to say their goodbyes.  On the morning of the 13th day patient was removed from life support and she passed.

I got chills and fever, but didn&#39;t take my temperature. The next morning, took my temperature and it was 101. Ate a piece of coffee cake with some tea. Was very tired, so went back to  bed. Was also a bit queasy, and not hungry for lunch, and had a mild headache. Slept most of the day, had chills and fever off and on, and joints very sore. I did eat dinner. The next day I was much better, but still had some soreness in my joints, one or two episodes of mild chills, was somewhat tired and lethargic. The next day I was more or less back to normal. I did take Tylenol at some point, but I can&#39;t remember if it was the afternoon of the first day of fever, or not until the next afternoon. I know I did take it again the next morning.  All in all, it felt like a full-blown case of the flu, but was of short duration.

I took a Zyrtec-D the morning of the injection so I think that helped keep the swelling under control.  April 15, 2021-around 6:00 pm I became very nauseous and dizzy.  The nausea subsided by the next morning but the dizziness has continued to this day.  Had to stay in bed all day April 17 and 18 due to dizziness.

This lasted less than 2 days.  Other things, mostly starting 5 or 6 days later and some cropping up as late as 4/11.    Random itchy red rashes on each shoulder and back of upper arm that would go away within an hour or 2.   Itching and possibly bumps on buttocks and thighs.  Intensely itching palms for a little while on 2 or 3 different days.  Sudden appearance of a 4 x 4 inch patch of 15-20 bumps of various sizes in the crook of my left elbow (injection arm) with bright red skin. These looked similar to mosquito bites or blisters but didn&#39;t itch. It completely disappeared without a trace within an hour.    Tingling tongue followed by tongue swelling on 4/6/21.  I had eaten my bran flakes with some rice pudding a little bit before this, both of which I&#39;d eaten every day for the past week or so and had had several times in the past. On the advice of my doctor&#39;s nurse, my husband drove me to an urgent care center. By the time we got there, probably 1.5 hours after this started, the swelling was some better. The nurse practitioner that I saw prescribed an antihistamine and 3 days of one 20 mg prednisone pill a day. I&#39;ve never had a tingling or swelling tongue before in my life. I took only a half of one prednisone on 4/6, no Allegra.  On 4/7 the random itchy red rashes mostly on arms/shoulders happened once or twice and disappeared fairly quickly, but my upper lip swelled. I could feel it happening as I sat in my recliner in the morning. I hadn&#39;t had anything to eat yet. The doctor advised I take my Allegra and prednisone I received at urgent care on 4/6, so I did. The lip swelling gradually went down over a few days, but it still feels irritated on the inside of the lip as of 4/11.   Diarrhea beginning around 1:30 a.m. 4/8. Lasted about 3 days. I only very very rarely have diarrhea.  Mild sore throat starting Friday 4/10. Better by Saturday. Sore throats are so rare for me that I can&#39;t remember the last one, possibly several years ago.

My chest was burning like it was on fire - lungs felt like they were on  fire. I woke up the next morning, with a little bit of body aches - I slept the entire next day pretty much (the 7th). On the 7th, I noticed that my heart was beating - fluttering- skipping- beating. My left left also swelled up and was red. I had  PVCs with pulmonary embolism on that left leg  in1996 - when I was doing the chemo. My left leg ached, burned and got red on the 7th. I was going to see the PCP the following week and I was still having issues with the heart but the leg was getting better. It can still swell, burn and get red quite a bit of night because I stand on my legs all day - but the amount of pain and swelling did go down over that week while I was waiting to see the doctor. I had an ultrasound on my leg. And a heart halter to monitor my heart for 24 hours. I do have PVCs.  Stress from vaccine caused Herpes Outbreak - that was on the left inner thigh right next to genitals - bumps within four days of vaccine.  Created more pain. Took Benadryl for pain - helps with the nerve pain - two days with. I took 3000 mg a day of Tylenol for three days after the vaccine.  Have not recovered from the calf and heart symptoms.

The pain was predominately at night while laying down and would occur between 3-4 am .  The pain did not pass. I went to the emergency room on April 15, where i told them I had the J&amp; J vaccine and was now experiencing the abdominal pain which was in the time frame for the side effects of the J&amp; J vaccine. They did  a CT scan, it showed diverticulitis with an abscess. I had no previous issue with diverticulitis until this time, my diet had not changed either. I was admitted to the hospital for treatment

                                                8 hours after getting the vaccine I started feeling very cold. It came on me all of a sudden.  Shaking, shivering, teeth chattering ensued along with generally feeling very unwell.  (Similar to how I felt years ago after having surgery)  This progressed during the night to fever, chills, extreme body aches, stabbing pains in the head, heart racing, dizziness and nausea.  After 12 hours I started to feeling improvement.  At the 16 hour mark I am really tired and nauseous but feel like I&#39;m coming back.  Probably the worst I&#39;ve ever felt.  We considered going to the ER in the night.

I returned home and took immediately to the couch, where I had a low grade fever and stayed all day. I had no appetite, no energy to get up except to go to the bathroom.

I woke up and I was talking gibberish. I was aware that nothing I said was making sense. I went to bed and slept almost 24 hours. I woke up feeling wiped out but I wasn&#39;t confused and I was talking normal again. Right arm hurt and is numb. ( right side of my body typically is kind of numb but the right arm seemed more so numb after the vaccine)

                                                The actual injection itself was so painful that I almost passed out. It hurts so badly while the needle was in my arm and when she took it out it was worse. I was in such pain that I began to sweat profusely and apparently I turned white and began dry heaving. This was all within a minute or so.  I really thought I was going to pass out. A woman with a tag that said pharmacist came rushing over. She got a reclining chair with wheels, they help me into it and then took me to a recovery room. After a few more minutes of sweating and dry heaving I began feeling better.  The pharmacist got me some paper towels so I could dry myself off as I was drenched in sweat. I asked her for a bottle of water. I waited the 15 minutes and came home.  They never checked my vital signs. Once I got home, I laid down and slept for 15 hours. I was fine the next day and my arm was never sore.  Could  the shot have hit a nerve? I?ve never felt such acute pain.

Mild flu the next day with  general Malaise.  The chills were so intense that I was constricted for much of the time with little relieve. I would call them violent chills with a tetany kind of full body involvement.  Never have  I experienced chills like I have described. I?ve never had a reaction to vaccines and tend have a high tolerance. I did not contact my physician but spoke to colleagues who suggested  report the experience.

I went to the ER on March 19  for nausea and vomitting, was dehydrated and received IV fluids. I also had hives which I was prescribed Steroids for.  The next day, March 20, I went to urgent care for severe hives and was given a steroid shot and epinephrine shot.  I don&#39;t know if these symptoms are a result of the vaccine, but I did not have them prior to the vaccine so I thought they should be reported.  Thanks

I threw up until about midnight for a total of 7 times. The night before I had difficulty sleeping. The next morning I felt nauseous again and threw up about 10:00 a.m. I started having diarrhea which has lasted through today (Thursday) and I had lost over 5 pounds in just 3 days and my weight is still over 5 pounds less today because it is difficult to eat much. Sunday I was feeling pain around my lest breast where I had had my mastectomy in June of 2006. That eased up the next day.  Feeling stressed because I have bad tinnitus and was worried about a reaction.

                                                Four days after I received the vaccine (this week Tuesday), I suddenly felt very dizzy and faintish.  I sat down until the dizzy spell passed.  I felt very cold and clammy and nauseous.  My hands were very shaky. I  felt very weak and very tired so I slept the whole day.  Today I woke up and felt the same dizziness, very cold hands and nauseous.  Both times I had diarrhea.  I have never had dizzy spells before so I know this has to be vaccine related.

Mental fogginess began at 8 PM (8 hrs after shot) and lasted until late the next evening Chills began at 8:30 PM and continued until early Friday AM. There were also a few instances of hot flashes in between the chills. About 10 hours after the shot the following began: headache (I rarely get headaches), nausea, muscle aches - mostly my quadriceps, low back pain, pain in the back of my neck, general lethargic feeling. These all lasted into Thursday evening, except the low back pain, which lasted into Friday AM. I felt a dull pain in all my back teeth that lasted about a day and was intermittent.

Early Monday, 4/12/21, I woke up with a severe sinus headache. I took some sinus medicine by 7 am but it remained fairly strong for 2-3 hours. It eased up some so I went to work and by 11 am took another dose of sinus medicine. I felt nauseated so I ate a couple of Tums through the afternoon. I assumed it was related to the sinus medicine.  After work, I went home and was very tired. I went to bed earlier than normal but woke up this morning feeling normal. (With a mild - as usual - headache)

                                                Got shot a little after 3 pm March 11, 2021. At about 10 pm that evening, had about an hour of chills, no big deal. Then began to get headache with slight fever and the headache got progressively worse, with nausea and rapid heart rate. The headache was so bad I could not sleep at all - the worst headache I have ever had. I took one extra-strength Tylenol at about 10 or 11 am the next day, March 12, which took the edge off the headache. The headache diminished till it was gone by about 8 or 9 pm. The rapid heart rate, along with tiredness, low energy, and feeling jittery continued for several days, then stopped. About 3 or 4 weeks later...there&#39;s more BUT FORM WON&#39;T LET ME GO TO CONTINUATION PAGE

I alerted the person at the vaccination site saying something was not right and then they called the paramedics who took my vitals and said my heart rate and blood pressure was extremely high. They gave me a shot of Benadryl and oxygen because I was feeling shortness of breath. They kept me until about 11:35 in observation when I felt myself again. The headache, nausea and body aches stayed for about 2 weeks but all other symptoms subsided.

I expected this, but a few days later I was still having what I describe as migraine type headaches and at one point I was sweating profusely, dizzy massive headache with not only nausea, but  dry heaving so bad I could barely get to my medication and seriously thought it would never subside.  I continued with headaches up until today April 14.  This is the first day I have not had a headache.  I contacted my vascular doctor as I had a blood clot several years ago and he has prescribed Eliquis twice a day for the next 2 weeks.   Today marks 2 weeks and like I said, it&#39;s the first day I have not had a headache

Began having a dry cough, went to nurse to as if normal, she said no, she started monitoring me. Still had cough, then became light headed and nausea. She gave me 25 mg of  Benadryl,  coughing continued, breathing became rapid, then I was given  shot of epi,  I became dizzy again and couldn?t complete a sentence. Words were slurred, heart beat racing. EMT?s were called. Received another shot of  Benadryl. It did not counteract anything. Received another shot of epi. Had uncontrollable shakes and hard to breathe or speak.  Was difficult to get BP reading due to shaking. Finally got reading of 196/99. EMT listened to heart and lungs. Said all was good. Taken to ER for monitoring of heart, Lungs and BP. Was there for approximately 2 hours u til shakes and BP were good.

Followed by nausea and violent vomiting. (EMT Vitals were all normal and they didn&#39;t think it was an allergic reaction this long after vaccine so I declined hospital ER visit.)  After several hours of severe dizziness I developed violent chills with heavy breathing that lasted 20 minutes then stopped.  Much improved after 24 hours but two days later I still have considerable dizziness. Headaches occurred Earlier in the week but none with onset of dizziness. Otherwise I experienced the typical fatique and flulike vaccine side effects with no pain at injection site about 2 days after vaccination that lasted several days.

                                                I received the Janssen COVAX on Monday morning, 5 Apr 2021.  A week later, on Monday evening, 12 Apr 2021, I experienced extremely painful leg cramps and broke out in a sweat. I felt extremely nauseous, and weak, this was followed by a sever pain in my head that was so extreme that I passed out. After coming to, the pain in my head finally began to subside, along with the leg cramps. My husband indicated that I was unconscious for just under a minute.  For the next two days, I had bouts of nausea, headaches, sweats, and was extremely tired.  On Wednesday, 14 Apr, after learning of the issues related to the Janssen vaccine, and the symptoms described being what I experienced, I contacted the advice (cont&#39;d)..Additional information for Item 18: Line and was told to go to Emergency Room at the hospital, which I did.  I do not feel that they addressed my concerns or the symptoms that I was experiencing, and at no time did they try to determine if it was due to the vaccine.  The discharge papers did not even address the &#34;event&#34; and the &#34;symptoms&#34; that I described.  They did not take any information down related to the vaccine, lot number, etc., that I had received.  They seemed to go through a set routine:  blood pressure, blood work, temperature, EKG, and CAT scan.    21. (continued)...Visited Emergency Room, however, was requested by ER to go to Primary Care as follow-up, however, as a  Employee we cannot be seen by Primary Care on THIS site.  Instead , we have to go on the local clinic to receive care.  The issue is that this was a vaccine that I was scheduled by my leadership to receive, with no choice in choosing which vaccine I could receive, and without follow-up care for adverse reactions. The hospital did not indicate to me that I should report this incident, however, I am concerned as a result of the &#34;event&#34; that I experienced, that it should be reported.  Furthermore,we should have a choice as to which vaccine we want to receive, just as everyone does.  Your form does not allow for input addresses  Also, your form does not allow for a phone number.

                                                2 hours after receiving the vaccine, I grew exhausted and had to sleep into late evening and was chilled,  had a fever of 101 and developed severe pain and inflammation on the top of my collar bone that was feverish and migrated toward my shoulder region on the same side as my vaccine. Ibuprofen would not help with the pain but helped with the fever. My mind told me that I had things to tend to the next day, but still was forced to sleep off and on for 2 more days. After a week and a half, not only did I have thirst, but also food didn&#39;t taste right and was metallic.  This lasted for 2 days and finally my taste was restored. The exhaustion lasted off and on for 2 weeks and I just listened to my body. The pain and inflammation on my collar bone has subsided 4 days ago but still have pain in my shoulder when I sleep.  On April 5 around 8:30 a.m. a nasty virus hit me out of the blue. I grew week and tired and had to go to bed. I slept all day until around 9:00 p.m. and woke to uncontrollable diarrhea and fainting spell while in the bathroom. I had abominable pain and nausea that last for a half hour and then I returned to bed. The next 2 days, I was week and exhausted but continued with my regular routine.  My equilibrium is still affected from time to time.

Then on the 15th or 16th I noticed that the roof of my mouth was hurting, was sore. So I asked my husband to check it for me because I could not see it very well and he said there was a sore on the roof of my mouth. Yesterday I asked him to check again and he said it was even worse. I am going to see a doctor today, appointment today at 12:30PM. I also saw another Dr. also at the same clinic on 04/14/2021.

I am calling it a &#34;fire&#34; to approximate what it made my abdomen feel like) for the rest of the week. Since the perception of abdominal irritation/inflammation wasn&#39;t on my handout of possible adverse reactions I did not report. I had muscle ache and ache that I treated with advil. Those aches only lasted 2 days, but the abdominal symptoms continued until the weekend. I read last eve an article online and am reporting because I saw that abdominal pain was listed as an adverse effect that was to be reported.

About 1:00 am I got so chilled I couldn&#39;t get warm, I did not take my temperature because my thermometer goes under my tongue and I was afraid I would break it cause my teeth were chattering so bad. The next day I felt very weak and nauseous.  Then I discovered I had a rash at the top of my legs. My left breast was very sore I felt like  someone punched me. Today is Monday and I still have diarrhea.

Headache became worse, and fever during the night.  By morning dizziness, extreme fatigue, severe headache and stomach upset which continued throughout day and night of second day.  By third day symptoms had subsided some but still incapacitating.  By fourth day better but symptoms still there, kind of how a hangover feels.  Each day since there has been a little more improvement.  Received the shot Tues. morning.  Now it is Sunday morning, and still some fatigue and dizziness, but headache is gone and stomach better.  Only medication I used during severe symptoms was tylenol.

I felt a bit foggy all day even with Tylenol.  3/16/2021 Still felt tired with a bit of a headache on and off. Took Tylenol and it helped.    I don&#39;t take meds often so I just took 500 mg Tylenol, 1 tablet. I am healthy with no underlying conditions and do not have reactions to the flu shot.  I expected the same  with this shot.

Lot of congestion and a runny nose.  I also got a stomach ache later in the evening.  by the time I went to bed around 10 pm I hurt all over and was very sick to my stomach.  I felt like if someone touched my skin my bones and muscles would all shattered.  I did not sleep much that night and woke up on Saturday, the 27th with the same symptoms but not quite as bad.  I still had nausea and a stomach ache and was very tired and drained.  I did start to get diarrheic around 3:30, 4:00.  I still hurt and have diarrheic and am very tired today, which is Tuesday, the 30th of March at 5:15 pm.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported.  The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included seasonal allergies, and codeine allergy. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1802068, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 05-MAR-2021 to left arm as prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 06-MAR-2021, after vaccination, she felt fine all day and night. The next morning she woke up and felt sick. She had nausea, headache, hive under eye. She laid back down and tried to sleep. A few hours later, she woke up to use the bathroom. She was very nauseous and dizzy. She lost consciousness and fell trying to get to the bathroom. She fell on her bed and was uninjured. The paramedics took her to the hospital. She was given medication for nausea, headache, and IV fluids. She gave blood for lab tests and they came back normal. No COVID test was administered. When she felt better, she was released. A few days later, she discovered her tongue was sore and red. She called her primary care physician (PCP). PCP said the red and sore tongue was probably related to allergies. Two weeks later, her tongue was not sore, but still red. They advised her to get a second opinion with another HCP. She was going to visit her allergy specialist.. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea, fatigue, inflammation on left eye, and small hives under eye on MAR-2021, and vomiting on 07-MAR-2021, and had not recovered from canker sore under tongue, and the outcome of fall on bed was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged).  Additional information was received from the patient on 23-Mar-2021. The following information was updated and incorporated into case narrative: Patient&#39;s medical history added as seasonal allergies and codeine allergy, Vaccination site as left arm added; Additional events as small hives under eye, fall on bed; lab test of blood work added; Event outcome of loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea, and fatigue was updated to recovered/resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: v1: Follow up information received updates  patient&#39;s medical history (seasonal allergies and codeine allergy), Vaccination site as left arm; Additional events (small hives under eye and fall on bed), laboratory test (Blood Work); Event outcome  (loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea and fatigue was updated to recovered/resolved). This updated information does not alter prior causality assessment of reported events 20210323730-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S-headache, nausea and fatigue. These events are labeled and are therefore considered potentially related. 20210323730-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S-loss of consciousness, fainted, heart racing, dizzy, vomiting, canker sore under tongue. These events are considered unassessable. The events have a compatible/suggestive temporal relationship, are unlabeled, and have unknown scientific plausibility. There are no information on any other factors potentially associated with the events.

The next morning I was very tired. As time progressed, I felt like I HAD to be horizontal. No energy at all. No appetite at all. Took my temperature and was shocked to see it at 101.4º. Pharmacist suggested I take aspirin, which I took one, and then another one several hours later. It did help and reduced the fever to 99º.  The following day the temperature remained at 99º but under 100º. (I never took any other aspirin other than the two that I mentioned). The third day I was good to go!

Later that day and up into that Saturday I was very fatigued, nauseous and the body aches were severe.

                                                After the injection I started to sweat profusely. I could feel the vaccine traveling through my body. I started to get sick to my stomach. I had to regulate my breathing by slowing it down. When I opened my eyes the light was so bright I had to keep them closed. I thought I was going to faint. I finally decided to put my head between my legs and then I started too pullout of it.  Very scary feeling.   This lasted for 10min.

The fever lasted one day and the back pain for about a week until it started feeling better. I also had pain on the left side of my stomach area and a rash under my breasts. Rash and stomach pain gone.

On the 12th had severe chest pains which I chalked up to a very bad case of heart burn.  On March 24th, while driving I had two major (what I thought at the time) was panic attacks...body started shaking, heart was beating like crazy, couldn&#39;t catch my breath, felt like I was going to pass out or die.  Had to pull over twice to calm myself down.  (From what I read this could be a sign of a blood clot but I am not a doctor.)  Had minor heart burn until April 5th....which ironically was the end of my 28 days until the vaccine fully kicked in.  Just reporting what happen.  I feel fine now.

                                                During the week of 3/29/21 (the week following my vaccine), I began to experience periodic lower abdominal pain (lower right and lower center) during movement (walking or going from sitting to standing.   On Monday, 4/5/21 (13 days after my vaccine), I began experiencing severe abdominal pain upon getting out of bed at 7am.  The pain was worse with movement of any kind (walking, turning, going from sitting to standing).  I was convinced something was seriously wrong, and called my Dr&#39;s office .  While waiting for the NP to call me, I decided that I should go to the hospital.  My husband drove me, and even the car ride there was painful (bumps and turns).  The pain upon standing was as if my bladder was going to fall out.  The pain when walking was a stabbing type of pain in my lower right abdomen and a stretching sensation in my center/lower abdomen. The E.R. Dr  diagnosed me with epiplogic appendagitis, and instructed me to rest, hydrate, and take tylenol. I followed the Drs advice.  I took 4/5&amp;6 off from work, spending most of that time in a reclining position in my livingroom and I drank plenty of water. I felt noticeable improvements daily.  I saw my PCP  for a follow-up visit on 4/8 for an abdominal exam, at which time I was experiencing pain primarily in bed (in a stretched out position) and periodically with movement (walking and going from sitting to standing or turning).  I had my second follow-up today with my PCP (4/15).  I continue to improve daily.

                                                My symptoms started 03-18-2021 at 11am where I developed chills, was very sleepy that I slept 15 hours straight. I felt very fatigued and my eyes hurt so much and I could not keep them open. On 04-06-2021 I still was not feeling well. I started to have problems with my right side of my face, eyes and mouth which gradually got worse so I went to the hospital. At the hospital they checked me for stroke, performed lab work, did MRI and CT scans and the  the doctors came back and said it was Bell&#39;s palsy. I again went to the hospital 04-11-2021 but this time due to GI issues with pain.  On 04-14-2021 through 04-15-2021, I started to experience neck pain behind my right ear. At the hospital they had prescribed my prednisone 50mg, so I took half for my pain.  I still have trouble sleeping and have lots of pain.

                                                I received the vaccine on a Saturday evening and by Sunday morning, I was sick as a dog with flu like symptoms - massive headache, terrible backache (like someone kicked me in the back), chills and fever.   Sunday evening in the middle of the night, in bed, I was shaking so badly from chills that I was afraid to get up to get Tylenol.  I finally did and I couldn&#39;t even focus my eyesight and control my hands as I went to open the bottle of pills that my hands were shaking so badly that I spilled them all over the place.   Finally I woke my husband who heated up blankets in the dryer and brought me hot tea.  My husband helped me to the bathroom where I vomited.  I cannot remember when I was so sick.  I missed work that day at my part-time job and the next day at my full time job as a teacher.

Approximately a week later, the patient experienced stomach cramps and diarrhea and 1.5 weeks later she had foggy feeling in head and &#34;believes the vaccine is contaminated&#34;, had fever blister, facial pain and vertigo. Approximately 3.5 weeks after being vaccinated the patient experienced pressure choking and difficulty swallowing. A throat (ENT) specialist was unable to diagnose and they felt there was some autoimmune effects. A month after being vaccinated the patient experienced stomach burning sensation, night sweats and tooth pain. Given the close temporal relationship and the nature of the events, the events of sinus inflammation, sensation of pressure in ear, injection site lump, chills, felt ill, injection site pain and fatigue are considered related to the vaccination. The insufficient information precludes a meaningful medical assessment of the remaining events, including &#34;autoimmune effects&#34;. The events will be assessed further when additional information is received.

                                                4 hours after receiving vaccine I came down with overwhelming head pain that could not be lessened with pain medication.  No pain meds worked at all - all I could do was sleep.  I had nausea, muscle aches (bad-still suffering);  While still undergoing symptoms I got my teeth cleaned at the dentist (BIG MISTAKE).  I came down immediately with a severe periodontitis infection that needed treating with antibiotics.  The dentist was dubious that the infection had anything to do with the teeth cleaning (I disagree- I believe the infection exacerbated the period of disease (2 weeks one day )   I am writing because I literally CRINGE each time I hear about the Janssen vaccine only effecting a handful of people!!  I SAY CRAP TO THAT!!   This is a bad vaccine.  I have not been this ill for decades and it is doubtful to me whether or not it was worth getting this vaccine at all.  I would NEVER take it had I know HOW BAD and HOW LONG the side effects lasted - Over 2 weeks.  I highly recommend that this vaccine is permanently shelved.  I would not wand ANYONE to undergo what I have gone through the past 2 weeks - obviously complicated to some degree with the oral infection and teeth cleaning, however, I have never in the past been affected by a vaccine or teeth cleaning in this way before - ever.

The skin of my upper body begin to itch and burn and got worse over the next couple day. It continued to get worse so I went back to the pharmacy on 15th but the pharmacist knew nothing regarding what I was experiencing and advised I used Aveno and swithch from Allegra to benedryl to help with the itching and if it didnt get any better to go to the dr.  Within the next couple weeks I reached out to my PCP a couple times but all he could provide it that I continued to take the benedryl because topical ointments wouldnt work.  Its still here but not as bad as it originally was.   I have a dermatologist appt on May 6th.  It had gotten better over the next few weeks but I am still experiencing the skin sensitivity.

I had a weird sensation in my nerves in my right arm and a little all over my body. I think the shot may have hit a nerve in my arm. Two weeks after the shot I was very pale, and my stomach was very upset. I had a headache and abdominal pain. I felt very ill so I didn&#39;t eat or drink much that day.  The smell of food made me throw up and felt really bad for 24 hours. I did not eat much for three days and it helped my nausea and I recovered after four days I still had the unusual feeling all over my body. I got some IV therapy twice and it helped. It did start to fade over time and I finally started to feel normal after a month. I am fully recovered now.

They monitored me. After another 10 minutes, I was not feeling better, nauseous. My BP rose and I went into a fibrillation. They transported me at that time to the ER. The Afib went away on its own. It was probably an hour at the mobile clinic and ER ride; by the time I had arrived my afib had resolved on its own. Discharged Heart palpitations over the next few weeks. The following Sunday, I started to feel like I was going back into Afib. By the time I got there, everything was ok. They sent me home with a heart monitor for 48 hours. I will get the information on 5/7/2021. *5/7/2021 follow up appointment with PCM to find results of HR monitor.

This lasted throughout the night with body aches severe such that I was awakened by them about once an hour.  By the following morning, Friday, 3-12-21, symptoms were still present but less pronounced, and the headache had abated. Slept most of the day and by nightfall had only lasting fatigue, which was still present this morning, 3/13/21. By this afternoon all symptoms had abated.

Woke at midnight, 4/5/21, severe headache, now took (2) Advil and slept better until Mon. Morning, 4/5/2021.  Experienced two sluggish, low energy days and still have no appetite. What the heck????

                                                Within a few hours of receiving the vaccine, I started feeling nauseated. Since the day I took the vaccine, my appetite has been nonexistent. A day later, I felt very tired and confused. I received the vaccine on Monday and I woke up in a panic on Wednesday morning. My heart was racing, palms were sweaty, I felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe and it seemed like I was having a panic attack when I woke up. From that point forward, I fell into a deep depression. At first I didn&#39;t connect it with the vaccine, but I kept feeling nauseated and then wondered if it was connected. The depression became unbearable and I felt suicidal by the next week. I finally contacted my doctor&#39;s office and had a telemed visit where I explained that I had the J&amp;J vaccine the week before and these symptoms presented themselves afterward. The doctor put me on Zoloft and I HAVE been treated for depression in years past with that; however, I had not taken depression medication for about 8-10 years until this. Likewise, because my doctor put me on an anti-depressant, she also wanted me to see a counselor--which I have done. The medication is helping somewhat but I still don&#39;t have an appetite. I don&#39;t know if the vaccine had anything to do with the depression, but I wanted to report it just in case others have had similar symptoms.

                                                Metallic taste in mouth 30 minutes after receiving vaccine. I have had a lot of stress (significant other diagnosed with Stage 4 inoperable NSCLC ) and had been attributing the often present headache to that, but they were also accompanied by a butterfly pattern red flush across my nose.  Acid reflux which I was attributing to stress or alendronate.  Woke in the night 4/12 to severe acid reflux, nausea, headache, flush, thought maybe I was having a heart attack (I have no cardiac/BP issues); then last night, 4/14 about 6 PM, weird numbness tingling in right arm from center of my chest  passed in about 5 minutes. Significant Other said I had the pattern flush on face at time of attack which faded as I began to feel better.  I have not consistently felt at 100% since vaccination, but I have a lot going on and attributed it to that.

She reported the following:  &#34;She had a massive stroke on MARCH 27TH, 2021 leaving her paralyzed on the right side with the inability to speak, swallow, or see. She was initially diagnosed with Ovarian cancer approximately three and one half years ago. She was chosen for a study with Pharmaceuticals and her diagnosis was changed to a vary rare form of cancer called clear cell carcinoma which originates in the gynecological area. She did have a previous stroke approximately three years ago, (just after original diagnosis) but she was on a different course of treatment at that time...Oncologists have explained that this most recent stroke event would not be considered a side effect of her current treatment routine. She wanted to bring it to the attention of the health department in case it needs to be looked at more closely by the J&amp;J research/scientific team. She passed away on 4/5/21. Her current treatment consisted of palliative chemo only. &#34;  Decedent was a resident but was vaccinated in another state. After the CVA she was brought to the hospital and subsequently transferred to the Medical Center where she died on 4/5/2021. Sister is willing to speak with any investigators if deemed necessary.

My seizures are not always triggered by migraine. I have a history of hives and I get reactions to bites. I decided to get the Johnson &amp; Johnson because it seemed to be a better option. Ten days after the vaccine I had a Migraine that was so bad I had to go to the doctor. When I got there my blood pressure was high. I was given some migraine medicine, but it did not help. The migraine was there for four weeks after the shot. I still got a numbing headache after the shot until five weeks after the shot.

I started having diarrhea about 5:30pm.  Later in the evening  around 8:30pm, I had more diarrhea.  Around the same time I became very, very sleepy and had extreme fatigue.  My right arm where I received the shot did not hurt and still does not hurt.  Around 6:00pm, my left arm starting hurting in the same spot where I received the vaccine in the right arm.   On the morning of 3/8/2021, I ate breakfast consisting of whole wheat bread and peanut butter and weak coffee (my usual breakfast) and had diarrhea again soon after eating.  At 3:30pm, I ate broiled, skinless chicken, green beans and small amount of instant mashed potatoes.  Around 5:00pm, I had diarrhea again.  I have been drinking a great deal of water on both 3/7/2021 and 3/8/2021 as I normally do every day.  At 6:30pm, I had more diarrhea.  Soon after, I took two imodium gelcaps and hoping they will help the diarrhea.  My left arm has become increasingly more sore and hurts in the muscle.  No other symptoms.

Woke up an hour later (9PM) with fever (100.5), HUGE migraine and being nauseous. I threw up, tried to go back to sleep but couldn&#39;t because of the migraine and fever. Decided to take 2 Tylenol, but I vomited about 20 mins later.  All night, I hardly could sleep at all, so sick I was feeling (and I&#39;m never sick!). No reaction at all on the site of the vaccine, no redness, no swelling at all. All day today (day after the vaccine), I have felt really weak, slightly feverish (though less than last night), with a persistent headache.

This has caused difficulty in taking a deep breath.  No congestion, coughing, or vomiting. Just pain with inhalation.  Pain can be palpated in ribs, level 6 and 7.  Somewhat better today, March 17.

I tried to go back to sleep. When I woke up, I took it easy. I did get the chills and sweats thru the day; skin turns really red (MCAS). That symptoms still comes and goes. The chills, regulating body temperature, has flared back up after being dormant for years.  3/30 I saw MD. She wanted to defer for 4-6 weeks after vaccination to see if symptoms were still persisting or leveling out.  I have since canceled every sort of appt since then as I don&#39;t have the energy.  *I am on the very tail end of an opioid withdrawal; tramadol. I have taken for 6 years, 400 mg weened down to 100 mg this last year, down to 12.5.

                                                I had the Janssen vaccine at 2pm. on Friday afternoon. By 8:00 I was doubled over with stomach pain.  All weekend had pain, diarrhea and vomiting horribly.  By Monday March 8th I doubled over in stomach pain so bad I had to call an ambulance.  Was admitted to hospital on Monday with Accute Pancreatitus.  Was in the hospital until Friday March 12th.  I am a TOTALLY HEALTHY person that is NEVER sick,  very healthy,  and I workout daily.   I have no gallbladder, I NEVER drink ANYTHING,  there was NO reason I should have been there except for the vaccine  reaction.  After having a Cat scan, MRI, Altrasound , and an Endoscopy,  the my specialist concluded it was the vacinne.

Fever-topped out at 101.4 by 3:00am, body aches, repeated vomiting, repeated massive diarrhea, severe headache -crushing, squeezing vise  (in the top 10 worst of my life -including migraines!), bright pink/red fingers and toes, racing uneven heartbeat. Couldn&#39;t sleep. In tears from headache pain. In desperation took an 800mg Ibuprofen pill at 4:00am. Finally got to sleep. Woke up 5 hours later. Fever mostly gone. Other symptoms receding, except headache. Took 2 aspirin at noon. Still have minor headache. Yuck!

Made sure this vaccine didn&#39;t have PEG in it. Asked her to stay for 30 minutes after vaccine so I could monitor her. Around 12:10pm she said her mouth felt like anaphylaxis may happen. Asked her if she felt like she could swallow she said yes gave her (2) 25mg diphenhydramine. Had her sit and took her blood pressure which was BP 202/101 hr 70 I asked her if maybe she was anxious she said no she was very calm. Around 12:20pm she said felt throat was closing like before told partner to call 911. Got out Epi pen 0.3mg but she had her own administered 1 dose in right thigh. Shortly after EMS arrived and took over. The whole time she was awake and alert and responsive. Spoke to her around 4pm she was just leaving ER and said she was doing better.

These symptoms had a sudden onset. I am normally very healthy and active so these unusual symptoms without any illness were quite a departure from my normal health. They have, to date, persisted continually since onset over the past 3 weeks. They are very concerning. Last night I went to the ER to be seen since I could not get an appt. with a neurologist for several months and I am concerned about my sudden change in health status.

Within a week I went to the ER and had a battery of tests; The only thing that showed up is that I was dehydrated after several hours of not drinking water. Normally, I drink about 64 oz. of water a day. The pain sometimes radiated to my neck. An x-ray showed arthritis. I have had occasional nausea.

                                                After roughly 4 hours I started to get chills and body aches. I went to bed but could not get warm and writhed in considerable distress for at least an hour. (This was the most uncomfortable I&#39;ve been since induced labor before the anesthesiologist arrived for an Epidural 28&#43; years ago.) My temperature fell to 95 before I took acetaminophen and was able to fall asleep.. Now, at 7 hours it&#39;s 101.2 and I&#39;m just getting the side effects I expected: weakness, a little nausea.

Around 3  am, I was nauseous and vomited, although there wasn&#39;t much actual vomit. I vomited again around 9 am the next morning, with even less vomit, since I hadn&#39;t eaten any breakfast. I rested most of Friday and ate sparingly. Today (Saturday) I feel better.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Immediate dizziness, vertigo with nausea, dry mouth, shortness of breath, headache and increased blood pressure.  Later at night I had a low grade fever with achiness and headache. The flu like symptoms resolved by morning but I continue to have vertigo and intermittent nausea and my BP was still high in the morning around 9 am but came down by 12:45 to my normal range.  Paramedics at the site did a BP, pulse ox, blood sugar, ECG . Everything was normal except my BP which was 180/90.  This morning it was 167/98 and 168/97.  No treatment.  Saw my doctor&#39;s partner at 1:00 today and BP was back to my normal range but I still have mild vertigo and intermittent nausea.  Doc gave me some exercises to do for the vertigo and did not seem to think that it was related to the shot, but since the paramedics said they had seen a LOT of the same reaction yesterday to the J&amp;J shot and two sites in other cities shut down for the same reactions, nobody will convince me that it was anything but the shot. I expected the flu like side effects but never dreamed it would cause my  BP to spike and the vertigo.

We called the emergency services when they arrived she had collapsed. They broke the window and took her to the hospital, upon arrival we were informed that she has got a hemorrhage possible clotting due to high blood pressure. I now know the term is Cerebral Hemorrhage, she has been in ICU on a ventilation machine while they tried to drain the blood and clots. She&#39;s currently out of ICU however still complains about headache and back pain. We are informed that she has now developed some blood pressure and diabetes however it could be cleared in the short term. She&#39;s at the hospital and unknown how long she would have to stay there.

                                                About three hours after the vaccination, after eating a light dinner of two pieces of pizza and drinking a beer (to celebrate,  I thought) (an identical dinner to my husband, who was vaccinated minutes after me, and who suffered no adverse effects) I suddenly had extreme nausea and, immediately, projectile vomiting. My entire stomach emptied, but I continued to retch for the entire night and into the next day, weak and nauseated for about 72 hours. I became dehydrated but couldn&#39;t keep water down for 48 hours.   That first night, I experienced body temperature swings, whole body pain (not muscle aches, and not localized) and most disturbingly, hallucinations.  I awoke in the middle of the night convinced that my body had stretched in length  and there were two of me.  This was similar to the reaction I had to opiodes, but even worse (I didn&#39;t think anything could be worse).

                                                Dull headache for several days. Excruciating abdominal cramping off and on for almost a week. Arm soreness appeared about a week later severe enough to keep me from sleeping on that side of my body.  Lasted about a week.        At the same time,   large bruises appeared on the &#34;shot arm&#34; from the shoulder down almost to my elbow. Soreness in my right calf developed after four weeks and still comes at times.

The next day, bigger lump, swollen, all just below injection and red, moderate chills, a bit itchy, nausea., and painful. Same on 3rd day but much bigger redness spreading down arm, 2 1/2 by 2 1/2&#39; hard mass and red, itchy, painful, chills and nausea. Next morning called Dr. I am taking amoxicillin-clav 875-125ng tab.  Three days later mass is turning from red to pink and retreating. Still hurts  and now bruses show around the injection site, which I thought was strange. The vaccine actually hurt when given (I get injections every three months, so I know what they will feel like, but this hurt and went very deeply and then burned). I felt warm afterwards for about 10 minutes.

                                                On day 11 post shot I started to feel mildly nauseated. Next day nausea increased, as did muscle aches and pain - by early evening I had repeated bouts of uncontrollable vomiting and uncontrollable diarrhea [no cramps, no warning] that lasted most of the night.  I did have a fever briefly - got all red and felt like I was on fire - but that passed pretty quickly while the rest continued.   I had to stay up all night, any attempt to lie down triggered more vomiting.  By 3 in the morning I was ?on empty? and by 6 am could lie down.  Nausea took three more days to leave completely.  Muscle pain is resolving, almost gone.  I am resuming my meds [everything that went down before came right back up].  The only tummy pain was after hours of vomiting [muscle strain].   Today is the 25th and I?m still tired and a bit foggy but otherwise feel better.  I had a call with my doctor about this and she said I should report it so that?s what I?m doing.

                                                Prior to vaccination, the patient stated that she was nervous, but seemed relieved and okay directly following the vaccination.  Following vaccination, patient became restless during the 15 minute post-vaccination window about 2-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  She initially presented with uncontrollable shaking/bouncing legs, palpitation, sweating, and shortness of breath (though this was very brief.   Patient remained coherent and oriented to time/person/place.   The shaking and palpitations subsided after a couple minutes and resumed towards the end of the 15 minute waiting period, accompanied by nausea.  25 minutes post-vaccination she appeared to have stabilized, and we assisted the patient to her room nearby at her request to allow her to lie down while being monitored.  After returning to her room, she very quickly ran to her sink due to her nausea, then after a minute of attempting to vomit, she collapsed and appeared to have briefly lost consciousness.  EMS was called and the patient was rolled onto her side to prevent choking in the event of emesis.  Patient remained responsive, but was weak and clammy with a weak pulse and breathing.  After the firefighters came, a search of the apartment found the previously listed medications.  Additionally, the patient experienced a seizure-like episode lasting 15 seconds in duration.  Once the EMT came, they assessed her and monitored her in the ambulance; they reported that her condition appeared stable, her vitals were strong, and transported her to Hospital for observation/testing.

                                                Heart rate increased within 5 minutes of having the shot, went from 72 to 114.   My heart rate stayed at 109 or more until 10 PM the next night when its slowly went down to a normal heart rate.  At 3 am  (12 hours after the shot) i had  a blinding debilitating headache that lasted until 9pm the next night.   It also affected my vision.   The headache was so bad i could not concentrate on the simplest task.  I  was unsure of what i could take for the headache.   So, I did not take anything.    When i woke up i was very tired and this lasted until the following day.  6am i had a fever of 102.3 this went down to 100.4 at 9:15 pm that night.  I also had chills for several hours. 9:20 AM  the nausea started followed by vomiting and dizziness.   This only lasted for a few hours.    I  experienced very vivid dreams the night of the shot.    I only drank some coconut water all day and could not eat any food.  The next day Saturday March 27 i felt better but the fatigue did not go away until late in the evening.   Sleeping seemed to help but i could only sleep for 2- 3 hours at the most.

She felt well enough to leave the pharmacy on her own after 25-30 minutes.  The  patient had a prior history of anxiety prior to receiving vaccinations and was very nervous about getting the vaccination prior to administration.  The patients daughter was with her and felt that her symptoms were due to anxiety about  getting vaccinated, but later called the pharmacy asking to report the adverse events as being related to receiving the vaccine.  It is not known weather or not the symptoms are directly related to the vaccine.

My eyes swelled and they started to tear up, I felt weak all day and into the evening. I never had a bad reaction to a vaccine before, so this was surprising.  I contacted the health department as they came to my house and gave me the shot, but I could not get through to anyone. I had to leave a message. After I was contacted back, I was told that someone would contact me that very same day, but no one ever did that day or any other day. .Because of that, I thought it must not have been a big deal, but after reading today that people in a specific had some of the same reactions I did, I thought I should report it.

Stayed in bed most of the day on Saturday and went to bed early on Saturday. Woke up Sunday completely soaked from head to tail. I have never broke a sweat like that before. Felt a bit better, but still not great all day Sunday. Monday I got up and felt better. Had lots of things to do and when I returned home I mowed the lawn. It totally wiped me out, which it never does. I was sweating bullets and extremely thirsty. Today I feel better.

I am just getting my strength back and willing to trust myself walking.

I could not get warm, even with a heated blanket.  It finally subsided a little after midnight and I could sleep, waking every hour.   My body was very achy, and I felt exhausted.   I was very nauseous too.  The next day, Sunday, my body still ached and I felt weak, like recovering from the flu.  Today, Monday, I feel fine.    I did not call my doctor.

I finally fell asleep for an hour or two, then awaken just in time to make it to the bathroom where I sat on the toilet ALL night having severe diarrhea and vomiting into a container on my lap.   I would fall asleep, then wake up, on the toilet, very sick.    The vomiting ended after that first night, but the diarrhea has persisted.  It is getting better, though. (It has been 72 hours since the shot.)  I had a headache, my left arm ached, I was nauseous, and feverish until about 8 a.m., today, when my fever broke.  I still feel like I have a low-grade flu, which I have not had in over 40 years.  And, I still have some diarrhea.  I am sipping Coke and can eat some Cheerios, with milk and banana, but that is all that I want to attempt.

Tried standing to walk it off but legs were like jelly.  Tried bio-feedback to relax &amp; stop the shivering but it just continued in wave after wave. My chest tingled and my heart felt like it was working hard. It subsided around 4:30a.m. The next day felt &#39;punk&#39; muscles still jelly like &amp; jaw really ached from chattering. The 2nd day was fine.

By 21-MAR-2021, she had minor symptoms but fever went away, her arm was sore and she had diarrhea. Her symptoms completely resolved by 25-MAR-2021. On 08-APR-2021, patient went to see her Ophthalmologist to follow up on her minor low pressure Glaucoma and Dr. told her she had an Optic Nerve Damage. Dr. told her that her eye pressure is 10 or 11 and it did not make sense that her pressure was low but she had an optic nerve damage.

                                                Within 10 minutes of getting the vaccine I started having hay fever- like symptoms.  Sinus drainage, itchy, burning eyes, runny nose, scratchy throat, hoarse voice. This lasted for several hours. It again worsened during the night and next day I had bouts of nausea and some head ache.

On 04/06 She passed out while sitting in her chair, woke up and began throwing up. Had extreme short term memory loss and low blood pressure. On 04/08 while at her primary care Dr, he suggested a hospital visit with suspicion of possible stroke.  Was admitted  and released the following day. Dr advised possible mini strokes but could also be dehydration.  CBC with differential showed other results than dehydration.   Starting around 04/20 she started having chest pains and thought it was heart burn, after medication and another visit to her pcp she was admitted to the hospital again on 04/23.  Her troponin levels indicated a possible heart attack.  She had a heart catherization and was found to have a healthy heart.  Again, her blood pressure has been decreased since, her hgb and hct has also been low with a history of it being high.  A high WBC since all of this has started among other unexplained blood results.

Throughout the day the swelling continued on the left side of face, then on bottom of right foot and later on top of both feet.  Went to emergency room and was treated for hives.  Over the next five days, the hives kept moving around, the right side of face, and then to upper lip.  I followed up with my Primary Care Doctor, who did extensive allergy testing.  All came back negative.  I felt that it was a result of my body reacting to the vaccine.  In addition, I was feeling weak muscles and joints that kept moving around.

I could not go up and down steps as my legs would not hold me. Headache.  Week 2 to present. Fatigue, I have to nap every day and I sleep 8 hours or more at night.  Diarrhea, despite taking OTC medications  to control. Dehydration and dizziness. I am now 4 weeks since my shot on March 4th and I continue to have these symptoms.   I went to see my doctor and all lab tests are normal. There is no other diagnose reason for my continued symptoms. I wish I waited to get either the Pfizer shot or Moderna as I have not heard of these extreme and prolonged side effects from those shots.

                                                Noon the day after the vaccine I was suddenly overcome with nausea, and dizziness that sent me stumbling to bed and vomiting into a bucket next to me. Vomiting lasted for one session, but dizziness and nausea stayed for about 3 hours, and then nausea, fatigue and general sick feeling kept me in bed until the next day. April 9 I woke up still feeling out of sorts, but not as bad. Note: 28 minutes after having the vaccine, once I started driving home, the vision in my left eye suddenly went blurry, and I nearly lost vision in that eye. I tried to find a safe place to pull over but couldn&#39;t. After 5-8 minutes the vision came back but stayed a bit blurry for a couple hours. Never had any such thing happen before.

                                                Tues. eve., after the vaccine, I got the CHILLS that lasted all night long!  I woke up (Wed.) with  NAUSEA and took the &#34;anti-nausea&#34; pills that I had left over from when I had COVID (11 - 2020).  My upper arm was now very sore, especially when I tried to lift it.  I took my temp. and I had a FEVER (101). On Thurs., my temp. went down to 99.5 and the nausea was gone.  Today (Fri.), I woke up with pain on my shoulder (over the injection site). I took Advil and iced it and it is now much better (this eve.). The only side effect I have now is the pain in my arm (mostly when I lift it). I am eating better and sleeping better now.

I went to get a covid test because of the way I was feeling and it came back negative.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included bladder infection, and concurrent conditions included high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and asthma/ bronchitis/ get asthma attacks often. The patient&#39;s other pre-existing medical conditions included that she had no history of heart attack or pain. The patient&#39;s family history included that her mother had bladder infection and lady part infections. The patient was not pregnant at the time of reporting. The patient received Covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 202A21A and expiry: 23-JUN-2021) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 10-APR-2021 around 10;00 AM for prophylactic vaccination on right arm. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 10-APR-2021, the patient almost passed out after she got the shot (vaccination), they (vaccine facility) had to take her out to the car, and she could hardly walk. The patient reported that injector pulled the needle back and put it in again (Wrong injection technique). It was reported that right after injection when she turns around her arm was big as baseball, mushy, swollen and it was painful (injection site). The mushiness was going down, but it was still mushy. The patient&#39;s arm was hard as a marble, redness was still as big as a baseball and she could not touch her arm. On 20-APR-2021, the patient had bladder infection/abdominal pain to groin and had infection from lady&#39;s problem and further stated it as bladder infection. The patient think that the bladder infection was not because of the Janssen vaccine. On 21-APR-2021, the patient experienced hives on the neck and she applied Benadryl cream on it. The patient went to her physician on 22-APR-2021 (Thursday) and Nurse looked at her arm and said that it was perfusion and there was blood clot inside the bump.

On the same first night, the patient experienced nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. On an unknown date, the patient experienced wheezing and she thinks that her wheezing was not related to the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. According to patient her wheezing is related to her asthma. The patient did not have any trouble sleeping since she was taking the Benadryl. The patient stated that she could move her arm up and down, but she was scared to do so. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from hallucinations, bladder infection/abdominal pain to groin, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea, and the outcome of almost passed out, hives on neck, couldn&#39;t touch the arm, blood clot inside the bump (injection site), wheezing, could hardly walk, injector pulled the needle back and put it in again and redness is still as big as a baseball was not reported. The reporter considered the causality between Covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s and wheezing, and bladder infection as not related.

No concomitant medications were reported.  On 30-MAR-2021, following vaccination, the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation almost every day unlike the time before vaccination and her heartbeat sped up and then slowed down (irregular heartbeat). On the same day, the patient experienced brain fog, fever (axillary temperature of up to 100 degrees) and headache. Since the vaccination, the patient&#39;s nausea worsened. On 31-MAR-2021, the patient experienced stomach aches and generalized body pain. Due to the ongoing concern of reports of blood clots associated with the JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE, the patient&#39;s doctor put her on a blood thinner (unspecified).

Sent email, but response saying unable to help at this time.  Very frustrating as I continued having severe symptoms and unable to get help.  Finally feeling better enough today to send form.

                                                I received vaccine at 2:00 PM on 3/10//2021.  I was tired afterwards.  By 11:00 that same night I felt nauseous, has a headache and every joint and muscle  in my body was painful.  I could not sleep or get into a position where I was comfortable.   The pain level was a 10.   I took Tylenol in the middle of the night but it did not help.  In the morning I was unable to contact my physician&#39;s nurse so I called the 24 hour Nurse Line.  The nurse took all my information and told me that I could take Ibuprofen.  I took 400 mg. and found a lot of relief from that.  I still had some symptoms for the next few days.  By 3/14/21 I felt fine.  Now today I have a stuffy nose which could be an allergy to something else.  I don&#39;t know yet.

She had been feeling fine following it, until early this morning. She awoke and went to the bathroom when she noticed a &#34;paisley pattern&#34; that was &#34;all over everything&#34;, noting that it was even present when her eyes were closed. While she was in the bathroom, the pattern began to move, causing her to feel nauseated and eventually vomit. She has never had a similar episode to this.   All of her symptoms completely resolved after droperidol. Observed in the ED and was ambulating independently and returned to her baseline.  She had no recurrence of any of her symptoms. She was comfortable going home and discharged with her sister.

At the same time it felt like my head (in notch immediately forward of middle of ear to ear)  was in a tightening vise.  Then I got hot and cold  but not severely.  Same for dizziness, very mild. I was nasusseous and not able to eat.  I had random muscles pains , none lasting more than a few minutes in any one place. Odd thing was that I felt no discomfort at sight of injection. Next day I felt just as bad but at 8:30pm I felt like throwing up (after having 2 teaspons of vegetarian vegetable soup). However, I only had dry heaves. I live by myself and started to get scared. I called my daughter and took a Tylenol at 9pm. Within 10 minutes the feeling of a vise and my aching teeth felt significantly better. but  stil very fatigued. Next day, today,  I feel much better but still a little foggy headed. I can eat. I can function normally, thank heavens. If I had to take another shot now, I wouldn&#39;t. Not even sure I&#39;ll take a booster when it comes out . It was very scarey.

                                                Patient was seen in our ER on 3/8. She stated that she had received her Johnson/Johnson COVID Vaccine on Thursday (3/4/21) and since then, had been experiencing body aches, chills, fever, fatigue, headache, n/v/d. She was admitted for treatment with IV fluids and supportive meds for the n/v/d. On 3/9, she was still feeling very ill. Fever and chills had improved but she was still not tolerating PO. BP was also elevated ranging from 142/82 to 206/80. She was also diagnosed with AKI. BUN was 51, Cr 3.26. By 3/11, she was feeling a little better but kidney function continued to deteriorate. BUN was 53, Cr 4.39. The physician decided she should be transferred to a higher level facility for her AKI on CKD. However, there were no beds available. So she remained at our facility awaiting transfer. Around 1900 that night, she experienced a bout of hypotension and decreased urine output. Chest xray was normal. EKG was NSR. She was eventually transferred to another hospital on 3/12 at 1300.

Contacted primary physician who said he would try to get me ENT appointment ASAP, but suggested  I get audiology evaluation ASAP, which I did, on Monday afternoon, 3/22/2021.  Eval confirmed hearing loss with problem in R middle ear.  Developed mild flu-like symptoms on Monday evening that persisted for about 30 hours...mild nausea, headache, malaise.  Appointment with Dr, ENT scheduled for 3/25/2021.  He said I was about the 5th vaccine related hearing loss he had seen, and has prescribed a course of Prednisone, in hopes hearing will return.

                                                Beginning about 8 p.m. on day of vaccination, I grew fatigued.  Friday, 4/2/2021, I woke up and could barely get out of bed and had the dry heaves for most of the day.  Not able to eat anything.  Stayed in bed (except to dry heave) for the day.  The odd thing about this is that just about a year ago, I had the Covid-19.  It lasted for about 6 weeks.  At the time (March/April) there wasn&#39;t any test available.  After I had the worst sore throat EVER, I then had the malaise and dry heaves for a few weeks.  Finally I found that Pepcid helped with the GI symptoms.  That was after about 3&#43;weeks of this.  I literally could not get off the couch and slept much of the time.  I just find interesting that one day of the same type of symptom that I had when I had the active virus was a side effect.  Also, note my antibodies have been positive to date.  I&#39;ve been getting them checked regularly.

Soon afterward, her husband who was also vaccinated on 3/22 began vomiting as well. She did not think that this was related to the vaccine until she noted from the news last week (approximately on or around 4/8) that a batch of Jansen vaccine was discarded. This triggered patient to think that perhaps their vomiting was from the vaccine. Patient contacted the Health Department because she thought was should have this information for our database.

I don&#39;t know when the SOB started but it continued through the month of March. I thought it was an exacerbation of my chronic issues, by Sunday 4/4/20221  I coughed up blood, and on Monday I went to the hospital and had a CT scan and was told I had a pulmonary embolism and a clot in my leg. Now I&#39;m on an injectable blood thinner for the rest of my life and I was told it would take 3-4 months to resolve the blood clots.
