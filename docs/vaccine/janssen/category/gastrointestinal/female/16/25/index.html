                                                Minutes after I got the vaccine I started to lose hearing in my left ear (it sounded like I was under water) which slowly spread to my right ear as well. My hands and feet went numb and I started sweating all over. I felt sick to my stomach and I felt like I was above the whole situation-- I could hear the people talking but I felt like I was somewhere else. After resting my head on the table for about 10 minutes I felt better and was able to move to a cot where I rested for another 20 minutes or so until I felt pretty much back to normal. I was treated by the medical team at the site who cleared me to go home.

Woke up @12:30am with chills, a headache, soreness in the injection site, and body aches in the neck, back and legs.  Got up and tried stretching and drinking water. Stoped drinking water when I felt nauseas. Did not throw up. Took Ibuprofen and melatonin before falling asleep about 30 minutes after taking the medication. Woke up @3:00am and chills were gone, only left with pain in the knees and injection site. Wasn?t able to sleep until around 4:45am. When I woke up @7:45 am, I still had slight pain in the knees, I took Tylenol @10:45 am. Pain was on and off throughout the day. I took a hot bath, that helped the pain tremendously. Fatigue throughout the day. After sleeping the day after the shot, all symptoms are gone, only soreness in the injection site.

Her symptoms included dizziness, syncope, stomach ache, foaming at the mouth, vision disturbances.  911 was called and paramedics arrived..  Her vital signs were all normal.  Patient did not wish to go to hospital, and her mother took her home.  Other pertinent information is that patient has a history of seizures and had been off of her seizure medication for 4 weeks.  I believe that I understood her mother to say that her neurologist knew she was getting the vaccine today.  Patient reported no allergies to any other vaccine, medication, or other.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after injection, I woke up after sleeping for an hour with excruciating pain in all of my limbs, especially the injection site. I could not move any of my limbs. Not because of pain, I simply could not move them. I had a fever (temp not recorded, I could only tell because I was burning up.) I was very nauseous, but never vomited. I was shaking very hard and had the chills despite being covered by a blanket and simultaneously burning up. Both of my ankles that I had suffered a running injury to several weeks ago (I have an upcoming doctor&#39;s appointment to get them checked out) were pulsing with pain. I developed a minor headache. Eventually I either drifted back to sleep or stayed awake, because I don&#39;t remember anything up until around 5am when I was able to get up and take Tylenol and water. All symptoms were gone except for the minor headache.

About half an hour after that, had a bout of vomiting, loss of vision for about 10 seconds after standing up from bed (possibly associated with undiagnosed iron deficiency), and paleness of skin and mucous membranes.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Symptoms started yesterday, March 9th, with muscle aches in my lower back a couple hours after receiving the shot. The muscle aches spread throughout my body as time went on, and joint pain and headaches came as the muscle aches worsened. I took two ibuprofens, though they had no effect. A bit later in the day, I developed a fever and felt very nauseous. When I went to sleep, I had a hard time staying asleep and ended up vomiting when I woke up at around 1:00AM. Today, March 10th, I continue to have muscle aches, joint pain, a headache, and slight nausea.

Roughly an hour to an hour and a half later, the chills/shaking stopped, only to be replaced by a fever. My temperature shot up, my ears began to ring, and my head began to pound. When I tried to eat, I felt sick to my stomach.   My fever lasted for the entire evening, and I spent most of the night alternating between chills and heat flashes. My head continued to pound, and whenever I tried to sit up, I felt dizzy. At around 4am, I awoke with an upset stomach, diarrhea, and further dizziness.   By around 8-9am, my fever had subsided, and I was beginning to feel a bit better. However, I have been feeling physically drained and a little achy today (03/26).

Day 2 a bit better but still low grade fever of 101 degrees, nausea, weak, body aches but not as bad. In the evening around 5pm noticed ears starting to enlarge but didn&#39;t think much of it, by morning today at 7:30am I felt my face was swollen and numb on the right side. Now both ears were swollen and the area in my face was red. When I took my temperature on my forehead I was normal however the swollen cheek was 102 degrees. At that point I went to urgent care to get it looked out.  Currently at 6:30pm on 4/3/2021 the redness in my cheek has turn back to normal however the face is still swollen but not as bad.

When observing her, she appeared like she was going to fall over so I had her mom help me put her on her back. 911 was called and I took her blood pressure and it was 80/49 mmHg. She remained conscious and EMS took her to ED for observation. She was given liquids, discharged and told to come back if she had any other symptoms. Per her mother, she had not ate or drank anything prior to receiving the shot.

She did NOT hit her head and regained consciousness within a minute.  Felt nauseated and dizzy.  She remained laying down for ~15 minutes until feeling better.  She left later feeling fine.

                                                She had no history of anaphylaxis from any cause, she had no history of reactions to vaccines or components.  After about 5 minutes I checked on her and she said she was feeling very dizzy.  I called management for assistance and got her ice packs for neck and forehead. I took her blood pressure and it was 150/90, HR 73. We laid her down and elevated her legs.  She said that she felt some pressure in her chest but she had pulled a muscle there the day before and wasn&#39;t sure if it was related.  She said the room was spinning as she continued to lay on the ground and it was not improving.  Her blood pressure was taken about 5 minutes later and it was 143/85 HR 73.  She said it is usually low.   She had no signs of local reaction, hives, or swelling.  She complained of nausea.  After a few more minutes she said she was not feeling any better and was having pain in her throat and difficulty breathing.  I asked her to try to take a deep breath and she was gasping for air, unable to breathe deeply.  I administered epinephrine (one dose) and called 911.  I rechecked blood pressure while waiting for paramedics and it was 125/80.  She was taken to hospital when they arrived.  Her mom arrived shortly before the ambulance and went with her.  Pt never lost consciousness.  Management followed up with patient this evening and patient is home and well, but the ER did classify the event as an allergic reaction.

It started off with a slight headache and body aches with pain in my injection spot. My whole body started to shiver uncontrollably. My body aches focused on my spine and I started to become dizzy and nauseous. Around 4:00 am, the worst migraine, I have ever had that encased my whole head, lasted for about 12 hours with hot flashes. After the migraine, my body and head is sensitive to rapid motion and loud noises.

Patient was nauseated and dizzy for another 10 to 15 minutes. Pharmacy called local emergency squad to evaluate patient. Patient refused to be transported to local hospital. pharmacy made your patient had someone take her home. Contacted patient the next day and patient said she was feeling better. Patient believed it was &#34;needle anxiety&#34; and does not believe it was caused by the vaccine itself.

                                                Within the hour after receiving shot, migraine formed along with fatigue. Both progressively got worse through out that day(4/7/21). On 4/8/21 I woke up many times through out the night with a migraine that felt as though my brain was burning and sinus pressure, causing immense eye sensitivity. Throughout the night I became increasingly more sweaty, but didn?t have the proper thermometer to take my temperature.  I took ibuprofen (at 6:45 AM on 4/8/21) which helped those two side effects subside (around 8 AM). Fatigue has been constant throughout both days. Around 5:00 PM on 4/8/21 I ate broccoli and rice for dinner, small amounts, and encountered bad diarrhea. It lasted for about half an hour. Migraine is reduced significantly (at 6:41 PM), but there is slight nausea, weakness, and fatigue.

I tried falling asleep but my fever got worse, chills worsened, I developed body aches, and I got a massive headache. I ended up not being able to get any sleep at all during the entire night because I was in so much pain. I felt tightness in my chest, stomach pains, super sore joints, and my body aches and headache kept getting worse and worse. When I got up to go use the bathroom I could barely walk because I felt so weak and was super dizzy. Later into the night my legs felt like pins and needles as if they were starting to go numb. I still have a fever, body aches, and a headache.

                                                Patient received her vaccine with 2 family members in the room who also got the vaccine. Moments after (less than 2 minutes) giving her the vaccine, I was giving another family member the injection and patient asked if she could take her mask off. I turned around and she was very pale. She took her mask off and started slumping in her seat. She was taking deep breaths and reported no difficulties breathing. She then became ill and began gagging, at which point I gave her the trash receptacle to vomit in. I had a technician grab the patient a water and packet of crackers. After half an hour of resting in the chair, monitoring her breathing, blood pressure, heart rate, and getting some food and water into her system, she appeared and reported to feel back to normal. Patient&#39;s family member mentioned she had a similar reaction a few weeks ago when getting blood drawn at her doctor&#39;s office.

                                                Immediately after receiving vaccine, a cold, tingling, transient sensation was experienced radiating from the site of the injection up into the neck. Roughly 6 hours after injection (1 a.m., 3/9/2021) severe chills were experienced for approximately two and a half hours, preventing sleep. Patient experienced dizziness. spO2 was within normal limits. Temperature was measured w/ oral thermometer to be 101.3 degrees farenheit at 4:55 a.m. in the morning on 3/9/2021.  Treatment was a single dose of ibuprofen at roughly 8 a.m. (3/9/21). Pt. continued to experience fatigue and sporadic chills, with gradual abatement of symptoms over the course of the day. Pt. had no symptoms the following Wednesday (3/10/21). Pt. experienced symptoms the following Thursday (3/11/21), with a sudden onset of intense stomach pain (8/10 on NRS) starting at approximately noon. Stomach pain was more similar to muscle cramps (with aching quality) than nausea. Other symptoms included fatigue and some feverish experiences (such as chills). Treatment was conservative (ginger tea, peppermint candies, rest). Temperature taken that evening via oral thermometer (roughly 7pm, 3/11/21) was 101.4 degrees farenheit.  Symptoms were significantly reduced the following morning, Friday 3/12/21. Temperature taken approximately 10 a.m. was within normal limits.

Today I am still extremely fatigued and have a bad headache and dizziness. This was not relieved by the maximum dose of Tylenol.

                                                I have chronic tension headaches and yesterday my headache wouldn&#39;t go away even with over the counter medication. I felt overall achy but still able to get up and do what I needed to do. Once I went to bed though, I woke up around 2:00a sweating, achy, and with a fever. I couldn&#39;t fall back asleep very easily and once I woke up around 7:00a I confirmed I had a fever. I am currently still bedridden with a fever, complete body aches, and slight feelings of nausea. As of right now it is 8:56a 04/06/21 and the symptoms haven&#39;t gotten any better. I haven&#39;t taken any medication since 04/05/21 at 6:15p ish, which was to treat my headache from yesterday.

I started getting a headache, nausea, and weakness around that time too, maybe a bit sooner, like 3:00pm. The chills  started at around 5:00pm.

                                                Hives on my arms and stomach developed within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine at 2:16. I left the facility after 30 minutes because the hives did not get any worse and I did not experience any other symptoms. At home about 8 hours later, I started feeling exhausted, weak, and my body was literally shaking whenever I stood. Overnight, I felt feverish, I had the worst nightmares, and woke up every few hours. On Friday (next day) I felt dizzy whenever I moved, nauseous whenever I stood, and once when I was standing too long I started vomiting.  On Friday evening I went to a local ER (all the urgent cares were closed) at my primary care Dr?s suggestion to ensure that I wasn?t having an allergic reaction to the vaccine. The ER determined that the hives were likely an allergic reaction but all other symptoms were reactions due to the vaccine.

My fever rose to 102 and stayed there for 36 hours after being vaccinated. I was also nauseous and was unable to keep food down until 48 hours after being vaccinated. I was taking both Tylenol and Advil, but getting sick almost instantly after taking them.

                                                I had chills and a fever starting at 5 pm the day of the injection and those broke sometime in the middle of the night. I experienced some stomach discomfort but was not nauseous. However, in the middle of the night, I went to drink water and after the smallest sip I threw up everything in me. When I would use the restroom to poop I would feel a large pressure in my head, but only then and I also experienced muscular pain in my back. I was able to relieve symptoms with Advil. The fever and stomach discomfort was over by 3 am on 3/28. The chills came and went until mid-day on 3/28 and I believe that was with help of the Advil. The occasional pressure in my head only lasted until mid-day 3/28 and the back pain did not go away until the morning of 3/29. Following the vaccine I felt very dehydrated and while I drink lots of water, I had to increase my intake to even more than normal and this feeling was over by the evening of 3/28.  As of today, 3/29 I feel back to 100%.

I then realized it was getting worse, and I was shivering uncontrollably despite sitting in front of a space heater in warm clothing and wrapped in a blanket. I checked for a fever, but my temp was only 99. I fell asleep around 1 am, and woke up at 5 am (3/8/21) to a splitting headache, extreme thirst, slight nasal congestion, muscle soreness, fatigue, and nausea. These symptoms feel almost identical to the symptoms I experienced when I contracted COVID-19 in September 2020 at my university.

                                                Began with chills and muscle aches. Got worse over the course of an hour until I was unable to get out of bed. Pain in my muscles all over from hours of full body chills. The chills stopped after two hours at which point an uncontrolled fever set in. Highest temp recorded was 103. Severe full body muscle pain prevented me from getting up or drinking water on my own. Small movements like sitting up or rolling over to relieve muscle pain resulted in sudden and severe nausea. Considered going to a hospital to bring down the fever and hydrate. After two more hours of applying cold compresses, the fever decreased to 100 at which point I slept it off for six hours.  Prolonged bouts of dizziness, dehydration and nausea over the following two days.

                                                About 10 hours after vaccine, began to feel tired and fatigued and nauseous.  Then I developed a fever and sore muscles.  It progressed to the point where I needed assistance walking.  I had extreme chills with uncontrollable shivering and muscle spasms.  I felt very cold though I was burning up and sweating profusely.  I went to sleep and woke up a few hours later with no fever but very sore muscles.  When I woke up in the morning, I felt like nothing had happened, I was just a bit groggy.

                                                Patient received Covid 19 Janssen vaccine, about 10 minutes after administration patient started to get really hot. We applied cold clothes to the neck and head and patient felt like she was going to vomit so we also gave her a bag just in case she got sick. She started looking very pale so we layed patient on floor. She started to panic that she wasn&#39;t going to go to work and eyes were rolling in the back of head. Called 911 for patient and I stayed with patient, I took her blood pressure which was normal. Patient became fully alert again and stated she was feeling a little better. The ems checked her blood pressure and blood sugar and released the patient.

I had also drank some ginger and lemon tea before bed due to stomach upset (however I believe that may be linked to my history of digestion issues that are currently going under diagnosis linked to lactose intolerance and food sensitivity). 12:00 AM 3/12/2021: I started to experience a headache, muscular aches, and chills continuing. I made myself a cup of mint tea for the warmth and the addition of the stomach settling aspect of mint.  12:15 AM 3/12/2021: I had a bowel movement and the nausea and stomach upset and gas has begun to pass (making me think that portion is linked to non-related issues of the vaccine, but wanted to note in case your professional opinion thought otherwise!). Chills, aches, and headache still continuing with little shift in extremity. 12:30 AM 3/12/2021

I was extremely tired and stayed in bed almost all day. 2 days after the vaccine, all of these symptoms were gone except the injection sight is still slightly tender 4 days later.

Today I am feeling better but I?m still extremely tired even after restarting my adderall.

I had a mild fever, severe body aches, severe headache, nausea, fatigue, etc. For the entire day of 3/13 I was pretty much bed ridden. Around 5pm on the 13th I took Tylenol and felt a little better and was able to eat something and fall asleep that night. I woke up on the 14th with just a sore arm where I received the shot.

                                                Around 10pm on 3/26, I got a slight headache, but I am not sure if it was due to screen time or a vaccine side effect. Per the clinician that administered the shot, I took 2 tabs of Tylenol (one normal adult dose) with water and went to bed. At 1 am on 3/27, I woke up incredibly sore all over but especially in my joints. I was shivering badly and woke up in a tightly curled fetal position. I was unable to lie still or warm up. I eventually went back to sleep and woke up at 5 am, this time with extreme nausea and threw up everything I had eaten the day before. This went on for a couple of minutes. I was still shivering constantly and sore and achy everywhere. Especially in my knees, shoulders, and lower back. At 6 am, I was still awake and while I still had chills, my face felt hot and I took my temperature twice. First getting 100.74 then 100.86. Slept deeply for the rest of the night. At noon on 3/27 I woke up with no nausea,  body aches but only in my joints but with general soreness everywhere (like after a good workout) and a temp still in the 100.7 degree range. I took 2 Tylenol tabs at 2pm. At 4pm, I only had slight body aches, a headache, and a slight brain fog left and my temp was at 98.7, so no more fever. No further problems showed  up and when I woke up at 9 am on 3/28, I felt absolutely fine other than soreness at the injection site and a little chest tightness which last for about 2 days, through 3/30.

                                                Sunday night, my heart started pounding really hard. I went to ER - Medical Center. They did an EKG and took my vitals. I had a fever (slight) and chills and was nauseous. Put  ONDANSETRON -4 mg. The nausea didn&#39;t go away and I couldn&#39;t eat or drink without vomiting until today. I couldn&#39;t eat or drink or was very tired and groggy and miserable. Today I  had another trip to the ER Medical, I got on an antibiotic and anti-nausea medication (GETHALEXIN - 500 mg for the GI) (METOCLOPRAMIGE HCL - 5 mg-  for nausea) from the hospital and I had a shot that went into my immune system. They also found a UTI today.

                                                At 2 am, approximately 8 hours after receiving the vaccine, I became very dizzy. I work night shift and I needed to sit down. I started getting the sweats. After sitting for a few minutes, I tried to stand up and was very dizzy again. I immediately sat back down as I thought I was going to pass out. 30 minutes later, I had a nasty headache, the chills, pain in my knees and lower back, and neck pain. Also, I had pain at the site of the injection. I felt very nauseous. These symptoms persisted from hour 8 to 44 hours after receiving the shot.

                                                After about 6 hours of receiving the shot, I woke up with uncontrollable chills, and hot flashes in between, where my chest, back and face felt hot but hands and feet were ice cold. I had a fever of 99.9 and had a headache across the front of the face and nauesa. All of this lasted together for about 6 to 7 hours. During this time I took Tyenol, used cold compress, wrapped up in blankets and sipped on water. After the chills and hot flashes subsided I continued to feel fatigue,and had  head and body aches for the next 18-24 hours. During this time I continued with Tyenol and fluids. In all it last about 36 hours before I felt like myself again.

Shortly felt a burning feeling in my chest and  collar bones, that spread to my head. My head started to burn, it felt like it was on fire, along with my neck and chest. I felt dizzy, like i was going to faint, the burning and dizziness lasted for about 5 minutes. Shortly after i felt like my throat closed up and I was having very labored breaths. The burning feeling in my body and dizziness came back, along with not feeling like i could breathe well. I went to an ER, they gave me an IV with Benadryl, and I started to feel well enough 2 hours later to go home.

                                                About 5 hours after my vaccine I had already been asleep for around 30 minutes when I was startled awake by my own rapid heartbeat, it was beating so fast and hard that I could hear it and it woke me up. I reviewed my literature about the vaccine I received at the pharmacy and saw this reaction could be due to an allergic reaction but as an uninsured person I had to just wait it out to see if it would go away. I drank a lot of water and started developing a headache but my heart rate finally slowed down enough that I was no longer alarmed, but it was still faster than usual. I went back to sleep around 2am only to awake once again around 5am because I had begun to experience the worst body aches I?ve ever felt as well as nausea and a pounding headache. I live on a semi truck with no bathroom so my fiancé had to take me to my parents house so I would have access to a bathroom. I took ibuprofen and Tylenol for my pain and took 6 showers in 24 hours just to soothe my body aches. It felt worse than any flu I?ve ever had (I received the flu vaccine back in January if that matters). I was extremely ill and had no appetite and pretty much just slept and cried for about 36 hours total, but yesterday afternoon I finally felt a little better although still experiencing a terrible headache. Today I woke up feeling completely fine. I just wanted to report my side effects.

                                                10 hours after shot developed fever 102.  Shaking and holding chest.  Was able to calm her down.  Fever started to break in the afternoon on 04/01.  Continued to vomit all day probably because of the fever.  Gave liquids only. By 9:00 pm fever fluctuating 99 to normal.  Hopefully by 4/2 all symptoms will have passed.  I did not take her to the doctor for this although when the symptoms started I was very concerned because she does not speak and I didn?t know if she was having chest pains.

                                                At around 9:15 PM I started to feel nauseous and got out of bed to go to the bathroom. While using the bathroom I felt a very strong chill come over my whole body and started shivering and got directly back into bed and wrapped myself up in a thick blanket. For 45 minutes I laid wrapped up and was shivering constantly. At 10 pm I was brought extra blankets and a heating pad but moving to get situated caused dizziness. It was about 10:30 when the shivering stopped. I was able to sleep but got up to go got the bathroom around midnight and my entire body was drained of energy and I felt that I could barely stand and walk on my own. I was dizzy and my head hurt as well. I could barely hold my arms up to look at my phone briefly. Between 11 PM and 2 AM I had 5 or 6 high heart rate alerts (over 120) according to my Apple Watch but I did not wake up to them. In the morning (Sunday 4/4/21) around 9-10 am my head still hurt and my body was very achy and I felt very hungover. All day I continued to feel achy almost with a bad cold or a minor flu. Today has been better but I have still felt pretty drained. I?ve had continuous arm soreness in the arm I got the injection - but nothing too severe.   15 minutes after my vaccine on Saturday 4/3/21 I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and around midnight of that night I took 2 of pain relief PM acetaminophen (1000 mg of acetaminophen total snd 50 mg of diphenhydramine HCI total)

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccine (04/05/2021), I became very tired, but otherwise had no adverse reactions. I went to bed around 9 pm, and at around 3 am the next morning (04/06/2021), I woke up with severe chills, body aches, a pressure headache, and some mild nausea (I believe caused by the headache) that lasted through until early afternoon. Taking ibuprofen seemed to help the body and headaches, but it seemed like it was difficult to regulate my body temperature. I couldn&#39;t tell if I was too hot or too cold, and trying to remedy one or the other made me either too cold or too hot, respectively. All effects completely cleared up by 04/07/2021.

                                                I woke up noticing a slight headache, but I figured it was from poor sleep the night prior. I noticed after breakfast that I felt really cold and felt an internal shiver, especially in my chest. My fingers and toes were ice cold even with a sweater, blanket, and a warm tea. I noticed my skin starting to feel tender and I felt very fatigued. I wanted knew I needed to eat so that I could take ibuprofen, but I experienced a loss of appetite. I had a mild cough, but I felt too tired to even cough. I rocked in a chair in the sunlight outside for about 15 minutes and still felt cold. When I took my oral temperature after coming inside, I was reading 99.9. I took 400mg of Ibuprofen by 1130 and layed down to rest. Bundled in 3 layers, I felt the shivering couldn&#39;t stop. My headache got worse and my skin was tender to the touch. I was able to sleep for approximately 3 hours and I woke up drenched in sweat. I took my oral temperature again and was at 101.1. I drank some more water and tried to sleep some more. When I woke up around 4:30 pm, I felt a lot better. My temperature went down to 97.8 and I had a boost in energy and appetite. I no longer had a headache and I had only mild muscle aches. By the next morning, I felt completely normal again.

I started getting really cold, took my temperature and it was at 100.1. Got a headache, slightly nauseous, body aches got a lot worse (particularly my lower back). I was also feeling a little dizzy and having a hard time comprehending information; this was probably the fever. Around 8pm,  I took my temperature again and it had risen to 102. I took some extra strength Tylenol which started helping about 30 minutes later. I woke up 3/12/2021 still with some body aches, slight headache, and slight stomachache.

Every-time I stand up it jumps to 116. My resting heart rate was 113 for 8hours straight Monday night. So the j&amp;j website lists that as an allergic reaction. The urgent care basically said wait it out and be careful cuz if I move like too fast I could pass out again cuz of the blood pressure

The following day, I had severe chills still that were not improving, a headache, vomiting, muscle weakness, and slight shortness of breath. The chills started the evening of the vaccine around 6:30pm, and have not stopped. The vomiting happened the day after my vaccination at 8:30am.

                                                I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine at 8:30AM on Friday, March 26. The only symptoms I experienced until that evening were mild soreness at the injection site, mild stiffness/soreness in my left arm and my neck, and mild body aches. At 6:00PM that day, I was driving and experienced sudden-onset nausea and dizziness. I experienced tunnel vision and my vision began to black out. I was able to pull off the road and began retching and dry heaving. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my lips and then in my right hand, each of which lasted for about a minute. The nausea lasted for 5-10 minutes, after which it dissipated and I started experiencing chills. After returning home, around 9:30PM I experienced a severe headache and a return of sudden-onset nausea. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my right hand again, which disappeared after about 5 minutes. I retched and dry heaved again, and I took two Advil. The nausea passed and I was able to go back to sleep. The next morning, the nausea had completely disappeared,  and the only lingering symptoms were a mild headache and mild stiffness/body aches.

Approximately 5 hours after recieving the vaccine I started feeling extremely tired and cold despite the climate being warmer than usual. I went to sleep and woke up shivering, i was cold but my body was burning to the touch. My body ached and I had a headache and nausea. My eyes hurt whenever I moved them. These symptoms persisted until 9:18, I took 2 tylenol pills and started feeling better. Today is my third day, my eye pain has not gone and I still feel tired but what is bothering the most is the eye pain whenever I look anywhere or move my head.

The entire night was spent tossing and turning, drenched in sweat while simultaneously feeling like I was on fire. On top of this I had a massive headache. Today is the day after and my fever has gone down throughout the day, but it is pretty bad. I still have a headache and also vomited a few times today. I have been taking acetaminophen and took some pepto bismol. I was able to start eating later in the day.

                                                About 4 hrs later, I had a headache and neck ache. Around 8hrs after injection, I grew ill with a fever, severe muscle and joint aches, nausea, and the headache worsened into neck pain. I have had a bit of anxiety and all around emotional swings. I felt foggy and &#34;off&#34; at this time, like my head isn&#39;t clear. There has also been constant aching at the site of injection in my left arm.

At the top of the stairs I passed out and fell backwards. Not sure exactly how long I was out, but no more than a few minutes. When I woke up I was disoriented and nauseous but didn&#39;t have the strength to get up. I rolled into my side and vomited 3 times. My fiance helped me get up slowly. He took my temp but I did NOT have a fever. The nausea, dizziness, and lightheadedness subsided after about 10 minutes, so I decided to NOT seek medical attention. This morning I have a headache and body aches in my lower back and left arm.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine in my left arm, I felt a sharp pain as if I had been punched very hard. Starting immediately and over the next 10 minutes I felt dizzy and lightheaded, as if I were about to pass out. I also felt nauseous. I recovered fully about 15 minutes later, and I didn?t think to notify the staff.
