                                                Pt started to feel hot and nauseous about 5 minutes after injection.  Pt said her stomach &#39;hurt really bad&#39; and started to vomit a few minutes later.  After several minutes, pt started to pass out, so moved her to the floor for safety.  Several minutes after that, pt started to feel better. Soon after she was sitting up, and later, able to tolerate an orange juice, then leave on her own.

                                                Minutes after I got the vaccine I started to lose hearing in my left ear (it sounded like I was under water) which slowly spread to my right ear as well. My hands and feet went numb and I started sweating all over. I felt sick to my stomach and I felt like I was above the whole situation-- I could hear the people talking but I felt like I was somewhere else. After resting my head on the table for about 10 minutes I felt better and was able to move to a cot where I rested for another 20 minutes or so until I felt pretty much back to normal. I was treated by the medical team at the site who cleared me to go home.

Woke up @12:30am with chills, a headache, soreness in the injection site, and body aches in the neck, back and legs.  Got up and tried stretching and drinking water. Stoped drinking water when I felt nauseas. Did not throw up. Took Ibuprofen and melatonin before falling asleep about 30 minutes after taking the medication. Woke up @3:00am and chills were gone, only left with pain in the knees and injection site. Wasn?t able to sleep until around 4:45am. When I woke up @7:45 am, I still had slight pain in the knees, I took Tylenol @10:45 am. Pain was on and off throughout the day. I took a hot bath, that helped the pain tremendously. Fatigue throughout the day. After sleeping the day after the shot, all symptoms are gone, only soreness in the injection site.

Her symptoms included dizziness, syncope, stomach ache, foaming at the mouth, vision disturbances.  911 was called and paramedics arrived..  Her vital signs were all normal.  Patient did not wish to go to hospital, and her mother took her home.  Other pertinent information is that patient has a history of seizures and had been off of her seizure medication for 4 weeks.  I believe that I understood her mother to say that her neurologist knew she was getting the vaccine today.  Patient reported no allergies to any other vaccine, medication, or other.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after injection, I woke up after sleeping for an hour with excruciating pain in all of my limbs, especially the injection site. I could not move any of my limbs. Not because of pain, I simply could not move them. I had a fever (temp not recorded, I could only tell because I was burning up.) I was very nauseous, but never vomited. I was shaking very hard and had the chills despite being covered by a blanket and simultaneously burning up. Both of my ankles that I had suffered a running injury to several weeks ago (I have an upcoming doctor&#39;s appointment to get them checked out) were pulsing with pain. I developed a minor headache. Eventually I either drifted back to sleep or stayed awake, because I don&#39;t remember anything up until around 5am when I was able to get up and take Tylenol and water. All symptoms were gone except for the minor headache.

                                                After about 4 hours of having the shot, I got extremely light headed and nauseous. About the same time I got really bad chills and was shaking aggressively from the cold and got very bad pain in my joints, back, neck and injection site. My skin felt very sensitive and hurt to touch.  I took medication and felt a little better but was unable to eat due to the nausea. A few hours later I still had very sensitive skin and nausea but I was very hot and couldn?t cool off. The following morning at about 8am on April 9 I woke up with hives on my ears, back of my neck up to the top of my head and the center of my chest. I still had severe body pains and my hives spread throughout the day to my face, inflating my forehead, nose and lips. I was still unable to eat because of the nausea and I was still taking ibuprofen which usually eliminates my hives. My body pain, nausea and hives stayed consistent the entire day despite taking the proper medication precautions. At about 12:30am on April 10 I checked my temperature at 100.3 degrees. At 2:30am it dropped to 98.9 degrees. The first meal I was able to eat was at about 7:30am on April 10 while take over the counter anti-nausea medication. It?s currently about 5:15pm on April 10 and most of my hives have reduced to redness, my body pain and injection site pain is still consistent and my nausea has barely reduced.

                                                I got the vaccine at 3:45 arm was sore but I wasn?t worried Later that night around 6 I started feeling disgusting from vaccine so I took an Advil.  Around 8-10pm my body started getting chills, I started shaking, I had a headache my muscles were sore, and I started getting a fever. Around 12am all of the previous symptoms got worse my fever was at about 101 and rising and I was extremely tired. At 1am I felt the worst I have ever felt in my entire life. I could barely walk because my muscles and joints hurt and my fever was over 102.5 and I felt like my veins were on fire. At 2 am I moved to my bathroom because the floor was cold and I didn?t want my roommate seeing me cry from how much pain I was in. I have a high pain tolerance but this was the worst pain I?ve ever been in. In the bathroom I was at the peak of the pain of the vaccine. My fever was over 103 all of my previous side effects were worse than ever I felt weak and a little dizzy. I also was having a hard time breathing, my breathing was weak and I felt like I wasn?t getting enough air. I tried looking up on my phone if I should go to the hospital but I could barely pick up my phone to type or look. I dropped my phone and fell asleep in the floor for 20 minutes before I woke up. I walked slowly over to my bed and took a Tylenol and then had a sip of water and felt like I was going to puke. I tried to use my inhaler and I couldn?t hold my breath to use it. I crawled into bed and slept until 11 the next day and was too sore to walk to class all of my joints still hurt and I had a fever of 101 and a headache . I took a Tylenol and around 6pm my fever broke and I was feeling better. The next day I was still too sore to walk to class and had a headache. Today I am still sore but better my lungs still feel a little tight, I feel unfocused , and I still feel dizzy occasionally. I have no appetite and I feel nauseous when I eat so I?ve been eating in smaller portions . Every single day since the shot I?ve felt very tired. I hope these symptoms get better and Looking back on the night of vaccine I should have gone to the hospital.

                                                She felt totally fine after the shot and many hours after.  She felt fine to go to a horseback ride lesson at 4.  Half way through the lesson she acutely felt like she was going to faint/nauseous (she had a ton to eat that day, had a bottle of water just before lesson, etc. so she knew it wasnt those kinds of things) and then had a crushing headache with a lot of &#34;pressure behind her eyes&#34;, dizziness, and a really &#34;strange&#34; feeling like out of body, bawling crying, and started FREEZING.  I got there 15 minutes later and she was under lots of blankets, white as a sheet, freezing, said her spine was sore from the top to bottom... just tons of symptoms.  When I got her, she moved to my car and had seat heater on high and I had to put all the clothes from a suitcase I had in my car on top of her bc she was so cold and her skin was burning up.  I gave her 3 200 advil and a bottle of water.  ½ hour later i had a thermometer and even after that she still had 102.3 fever.  She was rambling some nonsense and seemed very disoriented for a while. She went straight to shower and laid on the floor of the shower for ½ hour, took cold medicine, and evnetually went to sleep.  In the night she was freezing again and the fever had spiked and she took more advil.  The next day she felt much better in the morning and fine by lunchtime.  She was VERY sick/uncomfortable with basically every symptom under the sun.

She was feeling fine up until around 10:00 that night when she began to have some of the regular side effects in addition to some unusual ones that were more concerning.  She had chills was feverish and nauseous with flu like symptoms of her body aching.  However, at around 10:30 that night she reported having difficulty breathing and having chest pains with pain when she would take breaths. She noticeably was taking very small but frequent breaths due to the pain. She described a pressure on her chest as if there was a bowling ball sitting on top of her chest. She was crying from the pain and her difficulty breathing. She also reported that her throat felt like it was smaller/ constricted.    At that time, she was given Acetaminophen and later around 12:00 she was given Benadryl.  When she went to bed that night, she was in pain but she also reported that her heart was racing and her resting pulse at the time was 110 bpm. She had the flu like symptoms into Thursday evening but by Friday she looked a lot better except for her difficulty breathing with complaints of chest pain when she breaths with continued pressure on her chest.  She rested in bed for most of Friday and on Saturday she got dressed in the afternoon and took a walk around half a mile at which time she was exhausted and felt out of breath.  When she walked back from her destination about a half mile, she needed to rest in bed to recuperate.  The pain while breathing lasted into Sunday. Monday morning, she attempted to run and became winded from running a short distance of ¼ of the block and could not catch her breath having difficulty breathing and throwing up with a lot of subsequent chest pain that day. She was taken to the doctor by 10:00 that morning to run lab tests and get an examination.  She is slowly getting better and taking it easy but Tuesday she still had some pain and by Thursday she is reporting that while the chest pain is still there it is more of a discomfort that she feels when breathing as compared to pain.  She continues to report the discomfort when breathing till today 4/16/21 and is still limiting her physical activity but going about her daily routine.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine immediately caused injection site pain which lasted for about a week after gradually getting better. About eight hours after injection, a fever and fast heartbeat accompanied by chills began and persisted for about twelve hours. A few mild and extremely brief feelings of nausea were present as well. After taking Tylenol six hours in, the symptoms started improving and were gone after seven hours. Feelings of tiredness were present for about two days after the first symptoms showed up.

I couldn&#39;t get a reading on the BP monitor at that time as it was too low to read and she couldn&#39;t move her limbs. While waiting  for EMS she could breathe fine, I could feel a faint pulse, but I had to keep taping her leg and talking to her to keep her awake. She was able to tell us her name and how many fingers I was holding up. I kept trying to get her to squeeze my hand, but I could only feel the tips of her fingers twitching and the whole time she was unable to move her feet/toes. I was able to look at her HR on her watch right before EMS arrived and it was at 62 and by that time her body temp seemed to be back to normal as her Mom said she felt cool and clammy. The BP reading by EMS was 100/60 and they tried to get her to stand but she couldn&#39;t and she still kept wanting to roll her head back and sleep.

The next morning, at 08:00 am, I woke up to abdominal pain right under my sternum - and it lasted until 08:00 pm that night - it came and went throughout the day but was pretty much over by that night.. I went to Urgent Care. I took Tylenol for the abdominal pain as they did not know the cause of it. I was very tired until Thursday of that next week.

By 9:00pm I was unable to move the left side of my body, had sharp pains throughout my body, and involuntarily urinated and vomited. This continues until 12:00pm Friday, the vomiting and urinating involuntarily stopped but the high fever, body pains, and numbness continued until Sunday evening. Now I still am experiencing random sharp pains and numbness on the left side of my body to the point where I cannot move it at all. I am throwing up occasionally (which has never happened before), and I have had a headache and insomnia since I got the vaccine. Pains behind my eye, loss of appetite and weight loss have occurred since.

                                                The next day, I had headache, fever, and felt like throwing up. I felt fine afterwards. I went to the doctor because I had an ear infection and it was really bad - 4/28/2021 - gave me some ear drops. The ear drops helped with it. I had the ear infection for about five or six days before I went to the doctor and it lasted three or four more days after I saw the doctor.

The next morning at the breakfast table she began crying and shouting that she had lost her vision and everything went dark.  Within minutes she stopped breathing and her eyes rolled back in her head.  Her body went rigid and her mother caught her as she was falling backward in her chair. Her skin was white and her lips blue.  I administered CPR and after approximately 4 mouth to mouth breathes she began breathing again.  When she regained conciousness she said she could not hear.  The paramedics arrived and tended to her.

I think that the chills ended around midnight. I lost my appetite the evening that I got my vaccination, haven?t regained my appetite yet, and I became somewhat nauseous. I haven?t thrown up yet. The morning the day after my vaccination I woke up and my abdomen was hurting a little bit. I was hot most of the night into the next day.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Symptoms started yesterday, March 9th, with muscle aches in my lower back a couple hours after receiving the shot. The muscle aches spread throughout my body as time went on, and joint pain and headaches came as the muscle aches worsened. I took two ibuprofens, though they had no effect. A bit later in the day, I developed a fever and felt very nauseous. When I went to sleep, I had a hard time staying asleep and ended up vomiting when I woke up at around 1:00AM. Today, March 10th, I continue to have muscle aches, joint pain, a headache, and slight nausea.

                                                Roughly six hours after receiving the vaccine, I began to get the chills, and I couldn&#39;t stop shaking. Roughly an hour to an hour and a half later, the chills/shaking stopped, only to be replaced by a fever. My temperature shot up, my ears began to ring, and my head began to pound. When I tried to eat, I felt sick to my stomach.   My fever lasted for the entire evening, and I spent most of the night alternating between chills and heat flashes. My head continued to pound, and whenever I tried to sit up, I felt dizzy. At around 4am, I awoke with an upset stomach, diarrhea, and further dizziness.   By around 8-9am, my fever had subsided, and I was beginning to feel a bit better. However, I have been feeling physically drained and a little achy today (03/26).

Day 2 a bit better but still low grade fever of 101 degrees, nausea, weak, body aches but not as bad. In the evening around 5pm noticed ears starting to enlarge but didn&#39;t think much of it, by morning today at 7:30am I felt my face was swollen and numb on the right side. Now both ears were swollen and the area in my face was red. When I took my temperature on my forehead I was normal however the swollen cheek was 102 degrees. At that point I went to urgent care to get it looked out.  Currently at 6:30pm on 4/3/2021 the redness in my cheek has turn back to normal however the face is still swollen but not as bad.

When observing her, she appeared like she was going to fall over so I had her mom help me put her on her back. 911 was called and I took her blood pressure and it was 80/49 mmHg. She remained conscious and EMS took her to ED for observation. She was given liquids, discharged and told to come back if she had any other symptoms. Per her mother, she had not ate or drank anything prior to receiving the shot.

I?m in too much pain to sleep even though I?m exhausted and for a little while, I was struggling to catch my breath. I also have chills and feel that a fever is not far off.

                                                She had no history of anaphylaxis from any cause, she had no history of reactions to vaccines or components.  After about 5 minutes I checked on her and she said she was feeling very dizzy.  I called management for assistance and got her ice packs for neck and forehead. I took her blood pressure and it was 150/90, HR 73. We laid her down and elevated her legs.  She said that she felt some pressure in her chest but she had pulled a muscle there the day before and wasn&#39;t sure if it was related.  She said the room was spinning as she continued to lay on the ground and it was not improving.  Her blood pressure was taken about 5 minutes later and it was 143/85 HR 73.  She said it is usually low.   She had no signs of local reaction, hives, or swelling.  She complained of nausea.  After a few more minutes she said she was not feeling any better and was having pain in her throat and difficulty breathing.  I asked her to try to take a deep breath and she was gasping for air, unable to breathe deeply.  I administered epinephrine (one dose) and called 911.  I rechecked blood pressure while waiting for paramedics and it was 125/80.  She was taken to hospital when they arrived.  Her mom arrived shortly before the ambulance and went with her.  Pt never lost consciousness.  Management followed up with patient this evening and patient is home and well, but the ER did classify the event as an allergic reaction.

                                                Within the hour after receiving shot, migraine formed along with fatigue. Both progressively got worse through out that day(4/7/21). On 4/8/21 I woke up many times through out the night with a migraine that felt as though my brain was burning and sinus pressure, causing immense eye sensitivity. Throughout the night I became increasingly more sweaty, but didn?t have the proper thermometer to take my temperature.  I took ibuprofen (at 6:45 AM on 4/8/21) which helped those two side effects subside (around 8 AM). Fatigue has been constant throughout both days. Around 5:00 PM on 4/8/21 I ate broccoli and rice for dinner, small amounts, and encountered bad diarrhea. It lasted for about half an hour. Migraine is reduced significantly (at 6:41 PM), but there is slight nausea, weakness, and fatigue.

It started off with a slight headache and body aches with pain in my injection spot. My whole body started to shiver uncontrollably. My body aches focused on my spine and I started to become dizzy and nauseous. Around 4:00 am, the worst migraine, I have ever had that encased my whole head, lasted for about 12 hours with hot flashes. After the migraine, my body and head is sensitive to rapid motion and loud noises.

I tried falling asleep but my fever got worse, chills worsened, I developed body aches, and I got a massive headache. I ended up not being able to get any sleep at all during the entire night because I was in so much pain. I felt tightness in my chest, stomach pains, super sore joints, and my body aches and headache kept getting worse and worse. When I got up to go use the bathroom I could barely walk because I felt so weak and was super dizzy. Later into the night my legs felt like pins and needles as if they were starting to go numb. I still have a fever, body aches, and a headache.

I felt extremely dizzy after recieving the vaccine, and I&#39;ve never felt like that after any shot before, sho I was concerned. Within five hours, I started feeling really weak, and I developed a fever. In an hour, my fever rose to 104, my hands and feet were blue, and I felt so cold my fingers and feet were numb. I couldn&#39;t breathe, and I started coughing every time I took a deep breath. My entire body ached and I had stabbing pains in my abdomen. This was the worst pain I had ever felt in my life.

I experienced no symptoms for 3-4 hours afterward, but then began to develop a low-grade fever,  muscle aches, a headache, and became nauseous again.  Around 12 hours after getting the vaccine, I developed a fever of 102 F, I began to experience severe muscle aches and cramps in my calves and abdomen. I also began to develop a much worse headache and lost partial vision in my right eye for a few hours. This is when I became violently nauseous, but I was unable to throw up, or defecate.  I was unable to sleep during this time, and at 2 am, my nausea peaked, and I threw up incredibly violently and incredibly suddenly. It was so violent, it caused me to pop a blood vessel in my eye, and gave me a sore throat. However, after throwing up, most of nausea subsided.  At this point, the vision began to return to my eye. 20-40 minutes after throwing up, I began to experience chills that lasted for up to an hour. Eventually, I slept at 4 am, but slept fitfully, and woke every 40 minutes to 2 hours.  At 7 am on the 9th, the nausea was completely gone the day after my vaccination, but the muscle aches and headaches were back. My fever was down to 101, and I took some Tylenol and slept fitfully until 2 pm when I woke up feeling significantly better.

I ran over, and as soon as I got there she started to convulse, therefore appeared to be having a seizure. I help her fiance get her onto the ground safely and placed her on her side, then called for my tech to call 911. The seizure/convulsions only seemed to last 10-15 seconds. She then came to, and was disoriented. Then she felt nausous, and threw up a small amount. The paramedics arrived, checked her out. She said she was felt fine, and refused to go with them to the hospital.

I tried to go back to sleep but kept waking up to drink water every half hour or so, until 10:18 am. I got out of bed to fill my now-empty waterbottle. The headache rotated and became more intense as I got up. I could only walk very slowly and tried to keep my eyes closed. Around 12:00 pm I took one tylenol. The headache is still present. It is not located in any specific part of the brain but moves around depending on if I&#39;m sitting, standing, or laying down. During that time I also felt nauseous, but I no longer do.

I had taken Advil at 8:30 and my temperature was still 100.5. (I kept taking Advil and my temp remained at 100.5.) The pain in my head was the worst I had ever felt and was intense and stabbing .I had waves of  nausea, and had extreme chills. I had severe hot and cold flashes. I also had a stomach ache.  I tried to watch TV but it was too painful. I was really scared and I did not think the night would end.

It continued to go up until it hit 104.6 around 9:00. My chills were gone, I was a little achy and had a headache, and was unconsciously crying even though I was experiencing very little pain. I took some Tylenol, and it went down to about 101 at 10:00pm. It stayed around 101 for most of the night and was back to normal by morning. We had called the hospital and they said there&#39;s nothing they can do for vaccine symptoms, but I thought I should report the high temperature.

Woke up every half hour to an hour after that until about 8am. Experienced chills until about 10am. The body aches lasted until about 10pm of the same day, getting less and less severe as the day went on. The headache lasted until about 11:30pm. I took two Aleve to help with the headache around 12pm and it helped fairly well, although it still lingered. I felt nauseous for periods of 5-30 minutes about throughout the day, about 5 or 6 times total. I went to sleep that night and woke up this morning feeling normal besides being slightly tired.

                                                About 10 minutes after my throat and mouth was extremely dry. I went to the EMT and noticed my heart rate was beating fast. They told me to go to ER and I was having a bizarre reaction and also had an anxiety attack, which took a little while for my heart to go down. I was extremely nauseas the following one week and a half.  I am no longer having these symptoms today.

She told us ahead of time that she occasionally passes out with blood draws, but never had any issue after a vaccine. About 3-5 minutes after the vaccine, the patient turned very pale and passed out in her chair. She did not fall on the floor but slumped to the side as we held her in place. After she came to she threw up. We had called 911 because it took her a while to wake up. EMS arrived and she was already feeling much better. They took her blood pressure and cleared her. Patient waited another 30 minutes after they left to make sure she was still feeling okay.

Nausea began shortly after fever started; vomiting started partway through the night, time unknown. Severe headache began in the afternoon of the shot and lasted through the following afternoon.

                                                Patient received her vaccine with 2 family members in the room who also got the vaccine. Moments after (less than 2 minutes) giving her the vaccine, I was giving another family member the injection and patient asked if she could take her mask off. I turned around and she was very pale. She took her mask off and started slumping in her seat. She was taking deep breaths and reported no difficulties breathing. She then became ill and began gagging, at which point I gave her the trash receptacle to vomit in. I had a technician grab the patient a water and packet of crackers. After half an hour of resting in the chair, monitoring her breathing, blood pressure, heart rate, and getting some food and water into her system, she appeared and reported to feel back to normal. Patient&#39;s family member mentioned she had a similar reaction a few weeks ago when getting blood drawn at her doctor&#39;s office.

                                                Immediately after receiving vaccine, a cold, tingling, transient sensation was experienced radiating from the site of the injection up into the neck. Roughly 6 hours after injection (1 a.m., 3/9/2021) severe chills were experienced for approximately two and a half hours, preventing sleep. Patient experienced dizziness. spO2 was within normal limits. Temperature was measured w/ oral thermometer to be 101.3 degrees farenheit at 4:55 a.m. in the morning on 3/9/2021.  Treatment was a single dose of ibuprofen at roughly 8 a.m. (3/9/21). Pt. continued to experience fatigue and sporadic chills, with gradual abatement of symptoms over the course of the day. Pt. had no symptoms the following Wednesday (3/10/21). Pt. experienced symptoms the following Thursday (3/11/21), with a sudden onset of intense stomach pain (8/10 on NRS) starting at approximately noon. Stomach pain was more similar to muscle cramps (with aching quality) than nausea. Other symptoms included fatigue and some feverish experiences (such as chills). Treatment was conservative (ginger tea, peppermint candies, rest). Temperature taken that evening via oral thermometer (roughly 7pm, 3/11/21) was 101.4 degrees farenheit.  Symptoms were significantly reduced the following morning, Friday 3/12/21. Temperature taken approximately 10 a.m. was within normal limits.

It was so bad that it caused me to stay in bed all day the day following the vaccine and I had to stay home from school and work. Today I am still extremely fatigued and have a bad headache and dizziness. This was not relieved by the maximum dose of Tylenol.

                                                I have chronic tension headaches and yesterday my headache wouldn&#39;t go away even with over the counter medication. I felt overall achy but still able to get up and do what I needed to do. Once I went to bed though, I woke up around 2:00a sweating, achy, and with a fever. I couldn&#39;t fall back asleep very easily and once I woke up around 7:00a I confirmed I had a fever. I am currently still bedridden with a fever, complete body aches, and slight feelings of nausea. As of right now it is 8:56a 04/06/21 and the symptoms haven&#39;t gotten any better. I haven&#39;t taken any medication since 04/05/21 at 6:15p ish, which was to treat my headache from yesterday.

                                                I began feeling a migraine at 3pm. I took a nap and woke up at 6pm feeling extremely ill. My temperature was 101.5F and my entire body was in pain. I took two Tylenol as suggested. Over the course of the entire evening, I was vomiting profusely; I vomited approximately 10 times. By around 10pm my extremities became numb and I could not walk without assistance. I could not think or speak straight. I nearly fainted every time I tried to sit up. I tried to take ondansetron for vomiting but proceeded to vomit the medication as well. I wanted to go in to the ER because I felt like I was dying, but I do not feel financially comfortable doing so. All symptoms remained consistent until about 3am when I was able to sleep until 7am. I woke up with several bouts of diarrhea, intense nausea, and head to toe muscle and joint pains, as well as numbness and tingling in my arms and legs still. It is now 5pm the next day and I still can&#39;t eat or stand for too long without feeling faint. I still have diarrhea and strong migraine.

                                                Last night (around 9:00 pm) I became very nauseous and had a severe headache, chills and nausea. I took 2 Tylenol pills and went to bed. At 11:00pm I became extremely ill with a fever of 103 F and vomited 4 times consecutively.  I went back to bed, still with a fever and chills. At 12:30 am (April 9th) I again started vomiting again (around 3 times).  I then went back to bed and fell asleep. I woke up around 8am (April 9th) still feeling feverish, with chills and a severe headache. I have no appetite and no energy to get out of bed as of right now (11:00am).

                                                Hives on my arms and stomach developed within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine at 2:16. I left the facility after 30 minutes because the hives did not get any worse and I did not experience any other symptoms. At home about 8 hours later, I started feeling exhausted, weak, and my body was literally shaking whenever I stood. Overnight, I felt feverish, I had the worst nightmares, and woke up every few hours. On Friday (next day) I felt dizzy whenever I moved, nauseous whenever I stood, and once when I was standing too long I started vomiting.  On Friday evening I went to a local ER (all the urgent cares were closed) at my primary care Dr?s suggestion to ensure that I wasn?t having an allergic reaction to the vaccine. The ER determined that the hives were likely an allergic reaction but all other symptoms were reactions due to the vaccine.

Sore joints, and entire skull hurt. Inner ears also hurt. Slept or 12 hours Headache was also present most of the day before the fever set in.  My period started the day before and usually I have heavy days first. I had a light day after my injection and today it&#39;s extremely heavy. So it messed with the flow.

At 7:00, three hours after receiving the vaccine, I developed a fever and slight nausea, as well as fatigue. I went to sleep at 9:00 and woke up several times during the night with a fever. At 3:00am, I woke up with severe nausea which lasted for an hour. At 6:30am, I woke up with a fever, headache, and muscle pain in my left arm and legs. I took two Advil at 6:40. At around 10:40 my symptoms were relieved.

                                                About 3 hours after vaccination, intense headache began. My head felt like it was being pounded with a hammer, and the pain was so intense it traveled down from my forehead to my jaw bone. At around 3:00 pm on April 8, I began to develop a fever which first started at 100 degrees Fahrenheit. By around 5:00 pm, the fever had progressed to 102 degrees Fahrenheit, and the 700mg of Tylenol I had taken was not breaking the fever. I started to get body chills, muscle pain, joint soreness, and cold sweats. Again, Tylenol was not helping. I had no appetite and was having trouble keeping fluids down. Around 11:00 pm on April 8, I took more Tylenol and the fever began to break but did not fully break until 36 hours after the vaccination. It is now April 10 and I am starting to feel like myself again, but for a full 36 hours the pain was so intense that even a light sheet covering my body was painful.

                                                My arm swelled up about 30 minutes after the injection near my shoulder. I started feeling pain in my forearm and the facility nurse gave me an ice pack. I stayed an hour after the shot and the nurse said I should be fine, so I went home. Around 10 pm I started having a really bad reaction, worse than normal flu symptoms. A fever of 102 and body chills that lasted for about an hour. Heart rate also consistently stayed above 130 bpm. I drank a lot of water and took an Advil. I then was advised to take a warm shower, and this helped bring my fever to a 99. After the shower, I became really nauseous and started throwing up. I was debating going to the ER. I also drank chicken broth and a lot of water and did not go to sleep until 4 am.  The next two days I had a low fever and bad muscle aches throughout my body, the flu symptoms ended in 4 days.

I started to get very bad body aches and the chills, later on  I developed a headache and I couldn?t move out of bed because I felt so sick. My temp reached 102 at 8:15 even after taking a 500mg tylenol earlier. I had to stay sitting up because I got nauseous when I tried to lay down completely.  I also kept getting very hot then very cold. It?s 4/13 and I?m feeling a bit better but still feel kinda weak and get exhausted easily.

Patient states that she got the J&amp;J vaccine yesterday and then over night she had onset of severe lower back pain that is localized to her back, but can occasionally be felt in her buttocks area. She first noticed body aches prior to bed. She woke around 3am to use bathroom and had terrible headache and back pain. Headache had subsided, but the back pain has persisted. The pain is located along her lower back, bilaterally. Sometimes the pain is felt in her buttocks. Pain otherwise is localized. Pain is dull, but intense. She rates the pain as a 8 or 9/10. Pain can not be alleviated. She tried a hot pack, with no relief. Laying down increases the pain, and the pain is so severe that she is unable to move. She feels afraid to move the pain is so intense. She has noticed no other symptoms. All other symptoms from the shot have subsided. Patient also became nauseated while in the exam room. Patient had negative pregnancy test yesterday. &#34;

                                                Around 5:00 PM after having gotten my shot, I arrived home from a drive down to meet my sister. Precautions were taken, masks were worn, safe social distance was maintained and I have no reason to believe any of the symptoms I experienced upon returning home were related to anything other than the vaccine, particularly since first that is how vaccines work and second one of my friends who was vaccinated at the same time as me at the clinic was going through similar pains.  It started as a discomfort in my intestines or possibly just below my stomach in general. I thought my pants were too tight but just in case I let my mom take over driving the rest of the way home. When I got to the house, I had about an hour of usable time left before I went into a complete state of delirium. We&#39;re not sure how high my fever actually got before my mom woke up and checked in on me at 9:00 PM, but after having pulled the covers away I registered at 102.5° F. I was screaming in a half-awake and half-asleep nightmare, trying to get someone to come help me and unable to get anyone&#39;s attention. I would, as a result, like to insist that it be added to recommendations to not be alone after getting the vaccine! For the whole first night! I believe that I genuinely could have died. My brain was melting for lack of more proper medical terminology, and I stopped being able to understand and speak my own first language in an incredibly confused state. This was entirely a result of two simultaneous factors: Fever and Chills. First, the fever made my skin ache. Wearing any clothing hurt. But once I took off my pants in exchange for some breezy shorts, I was covered in goosebumps and feeling frozen even though it was solidly in the 70s. I claimed under blankets and still couldn&#39;t get warm enough. The backs of my thighs were insanely hot in comparison to the fronts of them, so I just warmed my body under 3 layers of blankets trying to get the chills to go away. I did that for about four hours during which time I was basically constantly screaming incoherently.

I had migraines, fever of 101, chills, nausea, tightness of chest, abdominal pain, difficulty with my stool / bowl movements, and body aches.  I could not move, and most effects subsided after laying in bed for two/three days straight. However, continuing up to today (three weeks later) I have still had tightness of chest/throat, bowl difficulties, and abdominal pain. I also noticed that for the past 2/3 weeks I have also had blood spotting with clots alongside my abdominal pain. It has not yet subsided.

I did have muscle pain in my hips and legs. But I did not really have a headache besides just fogginess. I received my vaccine at 9:00am and they started around 6:00pm. I left work early and went home where I slept and woke up the next day feeling back to normal.&#34;

                                                Started out with a headache and dizziness within a few minutes of the vaccine, along with nausea. I stayed put laying down with a lollipop and water bottle along with ice packs on me for about an hour until I was well enough they thought for me to drive back to my dorm. Once I started driving the headache was back but I was driving so I couldn?t do much. Almost pulled over because I was getting over whelmed but ended up making it back to my dorm. Once I got back I changed and laid down in bed hoping to fell better. Things started getting worse from there. Throughout the rest of the day my head ache and dizziness got worse to the point where I was pretty unsteady on my feet. Chills and body aches also started and progressed rapidly despite no fever.  My nausea was present in waves but eventually dissipated around 8 PM.  I tried to go to bed around 11 hoping to sleep off the symptoms. I began tossing and turning. My chills were really bad and it got to the point where my skin was so sensitive that the clothes I was wearing touching and rubbing against my skin were hurting me. I was so dizzy and light headed to the point where it didn?t matter if I was laying down or sitting up, I felt the same, extremely dizzy and lightheaded as if cotton were in my brain or as if it were working too slow. It was like trying to process thoughts through molasses. Then around 1:30 I couldn?t take it anymore and thought maybe a quick shower would help me to at least feel better so I could sleep. When I got in the shower I immediately knew things were worse.  My vision started going black at the edges and black spots in the middle to the point where at certain moments I couldn?t see. I was fighting to stay on my feet and conscious and it was hurting to breathe. I knew I needed to get help so I stumbled to my dorm and collapsed when I got in the doorway to my room. My vision was spotty, my chest was hurting and I could barely breathe.  My hands and feet went numb as well, I was shivering, and my body temperature was a little down to about 98.1 degrees Fahrenheit.   I was transported to a hospital via ambulance my vitals were normal except elevated heart rate and O2 and  was admitted at 2:40 in the morning. I received a chest x ray and  my heart rate was better.  The dizziness was under control by then. I was discharged at 4:50 in the morning.

                                                Johnson and johnson covid-19 vaccine eau  March 20th - allergic reaction to covid vaccine Johnson &amp; Johnson. Allergic reaction started approximately 2 minutes after receiving shot. It started with itching and redness on my arms and upper chest. After approximately 10 minutes, I knew something was wrong and I signaled an attendant. They immediately brought me over to the EMTs on site, where they looks me over and started drawing up IV Benadryl. In the time it took for them to draw up IV Benadryl and insert the IV, the hives on my chest started to turn into burning and ice sensations intermittently. As soon as they administered the IV Benadryl, the itching redness and hives on my arms went away within a couple minutes, and I was left with only redness on my upper chest. They felt comfortable with me getting a ride to the ER from my dad and not getting emergency transport. At the ER, they gave me pepcid and prednisone. About an hour and a half later, I started developing chest tightness and hives and redness on the side of my face. They decided to administer more Benadryl and start epinephrine. I was discharged a couple hours later.  March 22nd - I went back to the hospital, with complaints of severe stomach pain. The stomach pain lasted approximately 24 hours.  March 20th to march 26th - I experienced extreme fatigue. I was exhausted to the point where on Wednesday I took a ten minute shower and by the end of it I had to lay down again because I was shaking from exhaustion.  Symptoms improved slightly until April 5th where it started taking a turn for the worse.  April 5th - I started noticing black spots in my vision that wouldn&#39;t go away. They didn&#39;t move and they stayed in one spot for hours until I fell asleep and then they&#39;d be gone the next morning. They usually started around 8:00 or 9:00 at night. Sometimes a couple hours earlier. They came every day until Friday April 9th when they did not come.   April 5th to present - I also started noticing light-headedness, motion sickness when I stood still or sat in a chair, nausea, neck pain, and periods of muscle weakness in the neck. These symptoms have not stopped.  Friday April 9th around 6:45 p.m. I started having a bad migraine, I noticed in the bathroom at work my eyes were dilating over and over and over again rapidly. The pain was very high. I ended up leaving work early and going to the emergency room. While at the emergency room they treated my migraine with a cocktail of Benadryl, toradol, and compazine. It reduced the pain at the time, however it did not take away the migraine.  Friday April 9th to present - My migraine has continued from April 9th and is still happening. I have been having severe light sensitivity, sound sensitivity, and trouble reading. The rapid dilation of my eyes stopped April 10th, however my eyes stayed dilated until April 12th.  In addition to all of my other symptoms, there are others that I am not as positive are relevant. I have asthma and it has been worse over the past couple of weeks, it it is not usually worse this time of year. I&#39;ve been also been having quite a bit more light bruising than normal over the past two weeks and over the past one and a half weeks I have noticed red spots all over my skin. I was not sure if these red spots were normal or not because I do have them on occasion however these are darker than normal.

Fever decreased, but chills, headache, fatigue, and vomiting continued. Patient was forcefully vomiting bile after not being able to keep anything down. Patient broke capillaries across the face. Extreme tiredness pursued, but symptoms dwindled over the course of three days.

These headaches have been so severe to the point that it induces nausea and creates abdominal cramping. She has not as photophobic as before during her headaches, and nothing seems to alleviate it but water and tylenol (but that has little lasting effect). Prior to these headaches her migraines came once every 2 weeks and lasted 2-3 hours at a time, with a 5/10 severity that was bitemporal with more pronounced photophobia.

                                                I feel inclined to file this report in hopes that someone could study how receiving this vaccine affected my endometriosis. Please understand that I?m a proponent of vaccination and building herd immunity; however, women?s health is important and we have a right to be AWARE of ALL side effects. I?ve done my best to research this topic and was able to find very few sources on how COVID-19 vaccines impact menstruation. Aside from the lack of statistics, I found forums on social media platforms with women explaining how their menstrual cycles became irregular some way or another. I did experience the common side effects of fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, soreness, and fatigue. In addition, I experienced severe cramps, back pain, thigh pain, groin pain, and nerve pain associated with the sciatic and obturator. I?m happy to be vaccinated because my immune system is far from the best, but if I were to have known that I would be unable to walk from the pain radiating from my back, pelvis, and thigh I would?ve opted for Moderna or Pfizer. At this point in time, I would NOT recommend the Janssen vaccine to someone with endometriosis. At that, this vaccine should be nowhere near as political as it is! My healthcare providers should be more willing to validate my symptoms, rather than saving face with the validity of the vaccine. I was told since my menstrual cycle is irregular I must coincidentally be getting my period, BUT I have not experienced any bleeding nor even spotting. I have no idea what the vaccine did to my body, I have no clue why it would induce such severe pain. I?m glad that the ?normal? symptoms have subsided by the second day, but the nerve pain complicates walking long distance or carrying heavy objects. I think I?ll eventually make a full recovery in the upcoming days, but this experience was so frightening. I laid on the floor for hours crying after I vomited up everything I had eaten. I couldn?t sleep because I couldn?t bear to lay down for long durations of time- and by that I mean more than ten minutes. It genuinely felt like I was getting my period, but whatever it was led to no external bleeding. Again, I?m grateful for the scientists who dedicate their lives to such integral work. I just wish I would?ve known about what was internally happening to my body beforehand, I would?ve chosen a different vaccine.

                                                There were no symptoms until much later in the evening. Around 8:30 PM, I felt fatigued. A little later I had chills for about 30 minutes. Then I felt nauseous and went to the restroom down the hall (I was living in a dorm). I did not throw up, but I had a pounding headache which only got worse. I also felt very hot and the cold floor was welcoming. I laid on the floor in the bathroom but felt too awful to sit up. Someone found me in the bathroom around 10:00 PM and called campus safety, which came about 20-30 minutes later. She determined that she could not give me medication on the spot and that she had to take me to the hospital. We arrived at the ER around 10:45 PM. The nurses and doctor took my temperature and found I had a 103-degree fever. Because of my pounding headache, I couldn&#39;t hear very well. The doctor gave me a shot of 60mg of Toradol at 10:56 PM. He then gave me instructions to alternate tylenol and ibuprofen every 3 hours, increase my fluids, and only do activity as can be tolerated. I left the hospital around 11:25 PM with a huge headache, but better than when I initially walked in.

                                                Midnight - I got a fever - my face was very, very hot. Fingers and toes were very, very cold. Unable to regulate body temperature. So fever and chills. Those lasted for a good four hours before it let up and then it happened again the next day and the day after that. I had about four days straight where I was not well and I don&#39;t remember a lot. On the fourth day, I was okay until the evening and I had really painful diarrhea. I couldn&#39;t keep anything in my body and I was in the restroom for about four hours. I was scared as to what was going on. I ended up calling telemedicine. The nurse I talked to over the phone and she said wait 7 days and that I should be okay. I was still slow and lethargic for the following week after but I did feel significantly better on the 8th day after the vaccine. In February, (before the vaccine) I had an UTI that I didn&#39;t go to doctor for. I drank a bunch of cranberry juice and I was fine afterwards. I do have an IUD- and on July 12th, I noticed the presence of a UTI and I had painful and really constant urinating. I was unable to hold on to anything at all and I went to Urgent care of the 14th. And they told me that I had deteriorated my bladder walls until I had come to a point where I couldn&#39;t hold on to anything. I had collapsed for lower back pain on the 16th of July and made an appt to go to doctor. I ended up speaking to someone on the 17th, and I got the medication that day for a kidney infection due to the lower back pain that I was having. And they said that the UTI had gotten so bad it had gone to the left kidney. I was first prescribed (on the 14th)  - Cephalexin and had me take something called Uristat - an OTC cranberry aid and then on the 17th - they told me to stop taking the Uristat so it wouldn&#39;t be stressful on the kidneys and they gave me a different antibiotic  - Ciprofloxacin and Extra Strength Tylenol. That helped with my symptoms. I had to go back in to the doctor today because for the past three days I have been having the same kidney pain again. I will get the lab results back sometimes this week. I either have another UTI or I didn&#39;t get rid of the kidney infection yet completely.

                                                I had chills and a fever starting at 5 pm the day of the injection and those broke sometime in the middle of the night. I experienced some stomach discomfort but was not nauseous. However, in the middle of the night, I went to drink water and after the smallest sip I threw up everything in me. When I would use the restroom to poop I would feel a large pressure in my head, but only then and I also experienced muscular pain in my back. I was able to relieve symptoms with Advil. The fever and stomach discomfort was over by 3 am on 3/28. The chills came and went until mid-day on 3/28 and I believe that was with help of the Advil. The occasional pressure in my head only lasted until mid-day 3/28 and the back pain did not go away until the morning of 3/29. Following the vaccine I felt very dehydrated and while I drink lots of water, I had to increase my intake to even more than normal and this feeling was over by the evening of 3/28.  As of today, 3/29 I feel back to 100%.

                                                Headache that evening and that lasted for about two days. Around 11 PM that same night of vaccine - I had chills but no fever. The second and third day I was super fatigued. Everything was okay after that but a week and a half later I was receiving severe stomach pain and a little blood in my stool. That is what brought me to the ER on 23rd when I had the blood in my stool . I had a rash on the back of my thighs  and I had swollen lymph nodes on each side of my neck that started after that. I went to ER again last weekend and that ER was at another location - no tests were done there. They told me to take OTC Tylenol. I still have the swollen lymph nodes and the rash is getting better not completely gone.

Stayed seated until it mostly passed, then went outside for fresh air and to cool down. Put a cold rag on forehead/back of neck for half hour following symptoms. Drank water at soon as possible. For the next 36 hours after receiving the vaccine: sensitive skin, muscle weakness, tiredness, headache, body aches (including the sight of injection), chills, hot flashes. Took Advil every few hours to reduce pain, kept lights off, laid in bed to rest.

By 7 pm, the fever progressed to 103.7 deg F. By 11 pm, I started to have nausea. Throughout the night I continued to have chills and sweats with episodic vomiting. The next morning I had terrible body aches and restless leg syndrome. I still had a fever and a lack of taste. It wasn&#39;t until 48 hours after receiving my vaccine that my symptoms eventually subsided.

That same evening I developed the chills, stomach pain. The next day I began experiencing a fever, headache, nausea, light headedness, dizziness, chills, back pain, lock jaw, some numbness on left side of face, zoning out or spacing out. My period also came two weeks early. I had some throat irritation as well as the feeling of being weak and some neck stiffness. All these symptoms seem to have gone away by Sunday evening, if not Monday morning. Except for the back pain, the nausea, and the throat irritation and some head pain and some numbness in face seem to have persisted.

                                                I had the typical soreness about 12 hours after the injection. No worries there. The next morning, on the 10th, around 11:40 AM, I started feeling extremely dizzy. The room started spinning. I was standing at the time, and I kept standing, but other than that, I had no control. My hearing starting going fuzzy, starting with ringing in my ears until it sounded like I was underwater. My vision started blurring, as well, eventually going completely black. For a solid 5-10 seconds, I could neither hear clearly nor see at all. I was conscious, because I could think relatively clearly, and I could feel my eyes blinking and could wiggle my fingers, but that was it. Once the episode passed, I immediately sat down. About a minute later, I started having excruciating abdominal pain. The pain was wracking my whole body, causing me to go pale (as I later saw once I could hobble to the bathroom) and making me sweat. After about twenty minutes, the whole thing passed and I was left with minor dizziness and slight nausea. Now, three days later, I still have some of the dizziness, but none of the blindness, deafness, or pain has returned. All other side effects, such as soreness, have completely left.

Following day it was still there, so we took her to the Emergency Room where after an abdominal cat scan she was diagnosed with mesenteric adenitis.

                                                After about 7 hours of receiving the vaccine I started to shiver. My body felt extremely cold even though I was in 75 degree temperature indoors. I started getting goosebumps. That lasted for about 9 hours throughout the night. I also experienced nausea for about 30 minutes at 8:45 pm. I felt like I was going to pass out within that time period too. My head was also hurting throughout the night. My body was aching through the night as well. The only reason I am not sure if I had a fever is because I did not have a thermometer. My arm was sore for 3 days and I was also sweating throughout the first night.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  The morning after getting the vaccine I woke up feeling very tired and sore/achey all over. I got to work (I lifeguard at the pool on campus) at around 6:15am and helped get the pool set up. When I sat down to try to do homework I started feeling very dizzy and nauseous. The pool deck is very hot, so I decided to try to go into the pool office where it would be cooler. I remember walking through the door and into the office, and then laying down next to the trash can because I thought I might be sick. One of my coworkers brought me some water and Goldfish, and I layed on the office floor for the rest of my 45 minute shift. Afterwards, when I was looking for my laptop, my other coworker said that when I had tried to go through the door into the pool office I had run into the door (I later got a small lump on my head from this) and that I had dropped my latptop. I do not remember either of these happening, so I believe that I blacked out for a moment, and it was likely hitting my head on the door that woke me up. A small scratch and some mild pain in my foot leads me to believe I dropped the laptop partially, but not completely, on my foot. I felt very tired for the rest of the day, and a little dizzy up until about mid-afternoon. I spent most of the day in bed sleeping. Waking up the next morning I felt completely fine, and was able to go about all of my normal activities with no side effects at all.

                                                Two days after receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson  vaccine, the patient (myself) awoke in the middle of the night with painful cramps in the lower abdomen. She got up in the morning to some blood in her underwear. The next day, she awoke to an immense of amount of blood coming out of her vagina to the point it was dripping down her leg. For context, the patient received the Mirena IUD several months ago and had not had a period since receiving the IUD, besides spotting. This is why these events were startling since she had not had a period in several months and this immense bleeding and cramping  was abnormal to her. As of today (4/15/2021), she has been experiencing heavy bleeding for 5 days. Again, this is very abnormal to her since she has not experienced a period for several months.

I felt like I couldn&#39;t stand up. I started feeling the chills and joint/muscle aches by 8:00pm. I fell asleep at 9:30pm because I was so tired and woke up at 11:00pm feeling incredibly feverish, naseauish and weak. I couldn&#39;t stand in the shower I felt so weak. Then around 11:30pm I vomited all of the contents of my stomach. I didn&#39;t feel nauseous after I finished vomiting. The next day I still felt feverish and like I didn&#39;t have an appetite. I spend around 5 hours of the day sleeping. I felt more like myself by 7:00pm the following day.

No cough, no SOB, c/o chest pain on inspiration intermittently, more a sharp pain near the center just above the breastbone, not a squeezing or a pressure substernal  Took some APAP and took alleve 20 min ago  I adv that the body aches, N, HA all may be consistent with ADR to the vaccine and generally should be limited to a few days, ok to take OTC pain relievers but not in excess to bottle recommendations. Keep hydrated. Consider a hot pack. Watch the chest pain if this persists or worsens,  consider HCF evaluation, though given the body pain throughout and location of the pain may be muscular.

A week later (5/03), singular hives began to appear on arms and legs, resulting in loss of sleep. Much worse the next day (5/04)- clustered hives accompanied with burning rash all over arms and legs. Benadryl anti-itch cream only enflamed them more. Vomited the next morning (5/05) and made an appointment with healthcare clinic, despite hives and rash subsiding overnight. Doctor ruled vomiting as an effect of prescription medication, but rash and hives as a result of a reaction to the vaccine. Next day and the day after,(5/06-5/07), had a few single hives appear on body. Haven&#39;t had any more appear since then, and I&#39;ve felt fine.

I considered going to the ER. I went to a friend&#39;s house and the pain from my leg and calf was extremely bad and 4:00PM in the afternoon, I drove to my parents house. My parents helped me out of my vehicle and took care me. I waited to see if the symptoms would go away or if they continued to persist and finally went to a Doctor after 3 to 4 weeks to find out what was wrong with me.

I got out an ice pack and put on the back of her neck and she leaned forward on another chair to try to get the blood to her head.  She started breathing heavier and complaining of her stomach hurting and not feeling well.  She was sweating and crying.  We called 911 and laid her on the floor with a cushion under her head until they arrived.  The patient continued to cry and complain of stomach pain and could not open her eyes.  She also had no strength to stay upright.  Her blood pressure was elevated at 163/100.  The patient was taken by ambulance to the hospital.

I fell back to sleep an hour later after covering myself with another blanket and throwing up. My Apple Watch shows at 4 AM my heart rate rose to 127 BPM when I was asleep. It is now 6 PM and I am feeling body aches, headache, stuffy nose, still a bit nauseous-- almost like cold symptoms.

                                                I first noticed that I was extremely cold and could not get warm at about 11 pm on the evening of my vaccine. I then realized it was getting worse, and I was shivering uncontrollably despite sitting in front of a space heater in warm clothing and wrapped in a blanket. I checked for a fever, but my temp was only 99. I fell asleep around 1 am, and woke up at 5 am (3/8/21) to a splitting headache, extreme thirst, slight nasal congestion, muscle soreness, fatigue, and nausea. These symptoms feel almost identical to the symptoms I experienced when I contracted COVID-19 in September 2020 at my university.

                                                Began with chills and muscle aches. Got worse over the course of an hour until I was unable to get out of bed. Pain in my muscles all over from hours of full body chills. The chills stopped after two hours at which point an uncontrolled fever set in. Highest temp recorded was 103. Severe full body muscle pain prevented me from getting up or drinking water on my own. Small movements like sitting up or rolling over to relieve muscle pain resulted in sudden and severe nausea. Considered going to a hospital to bring down the fever and hydrate. After two more hours of applying cold compresses, the fever decreased to 100 at which point I slept it off for six hours.  Prolonged bouts of dizziness, dehydration and nausea over the following two days.

                                                Patient received Covid 19 Janssen vaccine, about 10 minutes after administration patient started to get really hot. We applied cold clothes to the neck and head and patient felt like she was going to vomit so we also gave her a bag just in case she got sick. She started looking very pale so we layed patient on floor. She started to panic that she wasn&#39;t going to go to work and eyes were rolling in the back of head. Called 911 for patient and I stayed with patient, I took her blood pressure which was normal. Patient became fully alert again and stated she was feeling a little better. The ems checked her blood pressure and blood sugar and released the patient.

After laying in bed, the headache became extremely painful/throbbing. Full body aches (back, neck, legs) began. Ears got sensitive to sound, eyes got sensitive to light. Stayed in bed experiencing pain until ~1 pm the next day. After taking aleve around 11 am, the headache and fever subsidized, but the remainder of symptoms still persist.

Could not fall asleep due to difficulty breathing and headache and chest pain. At 11pm, began self-administering diphenhydramine (50mg) and Ibuprofen (400mg) every 4 hours. Was able to fall asleep at 4am. Symptoms improved upon waking at 8am, but chest pain and breathing difficulty remains as of 3:30pm April 9th (24 hours since injection)

We took her final bp and it was 117/73, she felt better and left on her own (walking unassisted). She made the statement that she does not like needles, and that every time she has given blood, she had passed out, or almost passed out.

By 11:00 pm my daughter started complaining with feeling dizzy. She kept saying she felt like she was going to throw up, meaning she was nauseated. She was complaining with her bones hurting. We both got these symptoms at the same time. We both stayed in and out of the shower letting the shower water just run on us. I had to give her ibuprofen because she complained of a mild headache &amp; the pain all over her body. She couldn?t sleep at all. She cried. It had her scared. I fully believe she?s having an allergic reaction to the Janssen shot. I have fully read the Janssen ?fact sheet?. My daughter was having hot flashes &amp; cold sweats. She has ongoing symptoms &amp; it?s been 2 days since receiving shot including fever. She was having what I thought heart palpitations. We both swelled up causing our bodies to feel tight. We both were healthy before receiving the shot. We?ve never had covid nor tested positive. We are currently going to receive a check up by a doctor. The side effects of this medication is dangerous &amp; doesn?t compare to flu like symptoms.

The following day was the exact same, except my front rib cage didn?t hurt anymore (only the back). I was extremely fatigued and I couldn?t sit down because my body hurt so much. The worst symptoms were the sharp ear and neck pain (by the ears). It was a sharp, sporadic pain, but it still hurts a lot.  It?s now been 2 days since the shot and the neck and ear pain is now more frequent, though my fever and some of my muscle sores are now getting better. I also feel extremely nauseous, like I?m going to puke anytime soon.

                                                7:00pm- start to feel really cold, develop a high fever and chills and eventually go home to lay down.  8:30pm- uncontrollable shaking and high fever maintains and I develop I very bad migraine, I can&#39;t feel my arms or legs and everything sounds like my head is underwater (I think this might have been a migraine but I&#39;ve never had one). When I stand up my vision goes black, and I develop joint pain, muscle aches, and very bad nausea.  9:00pm - I take 500mg of aspirin and all of my syptoms persist for ~30 minutes when suddenly my fever breaks and I&#39;m sweating underneath my 3 blankets and I can think again as long as I don&#39;t move my head. Everything still sounds weird and my stomach and joints still hurt but I go to sleep. 4:00am- wake up crying from the headache and with a fever again so I take 500 more mg of aspirin and set an alarm to take more at 10am.  10:00am- I feel exhausted and really weird, I take only 250mg of aspirin and sleep the whole day.  4:00pm - I wake up feeling so much better. Kind of achy and still very nauseous, my ears still ring when I stand up.   4:00pm yesterday - now: I kept movement at a minimum and was still nauseous throughout the day but was able to eat at around 9pm. I think I may have had a low grade fever on and off last night but the headache has thankfully stayed away and other than a little bit of arm soreness and weakness I feel back to normal today.

                                                I woke up at 1am feeling fatigued. At 3am it hit my like a truck. My body was so weak I could barley move. I had an unbearable headache. I felt very nauseous.  I had extreme chills and sweats.  This lasted non-stop  until 6am.  I woke up around 10am  with a bad headache and like my body had been through something traumatic.  I felt even more nauseous and had very bad diarrhea . Anything I would consume would make my stomach go into a knot and come straight out. After 10am I felt dizzy and weak. I still had a bad beach ache; and medicine wasn?t doing anything.  This lasted until I went to bed around 11pm that next night.  When I woke up around 9am on Friday I still felt a little drained and a small headache. My stomach was the worst part after my episode on Wednesday night. Around 5pm medicine started to help with my headache so I would say my symptoms stopped about that time , not including my abdominal pain. My stomach pain lasted until Saturday evening.

                                                Several hours after the vaccine I noticed abdominal pain located in my lower back, primarily on the left side. I also had a pounding headache (not a migraine), and other body aches. Over the next several days (Thursday night through Saturday, 4/1-4/3) these symptoms persisted along with mild dehydration and constipation. The aches I treated with ibuprofen, and I used a mild, natural laxative to try to poop. The constipation was relieved by pooping, but it was much less than my normal amount of stool, and it took a couple days to fully abate. I also noticed that I wasn?t sweating very much/at all until about a week after I received the vaccine, which was very worrying. I attempted to drink plenty of water during all of this, though I can?t be sure I succeeded. I think my menstrual period may have happened during this week, maybe starting on the Tuesday falling the vaccine, but cannot remember for sure. Constipation and dehydration are unusual for my period, though the pain is not. There was soreness in my arm muscles around the vaccine site, but it was consistent with what I feel from any other vaccine, and only lasted a day.  All discomfort ceased about a week after the vaccine.

                                                About 9 hours after receiving the Janssen vaccine on April 9th, I started feeling ill. I had a fever of 102, difficulty walking/moving on my own, intense nausea, numbness in my left arm for about 2 minutes, and I spontaneously got my period (which was very regular up until then). I took Tylenol, went to bed, woke up with a 100 degree fever but feeling much better, and it soon dropped back to 98 degrees.  Today, on April 13th, I started having pain in my left arm and leg. Specifically, in my left bicep (not the injection site) and my left thigh. This pain does not feel like muscle soreness, but almost like a knot? I&#39;m not sure how to describe it, but I find it odd the pain in my arm increases a bit when I walk/move.

I threw up 4 times and then continued to dry heave for another hour. My temperature hit 102. I then started experiencing extreme pain in my right kidney area. I ended up trying to take Benadryl and then  threw that right up. I  then ended up going to the ER and receiving  Zofran, Fluids, Tylenol, Torodol and Morphine.   I got discharged with &#34;an adverse reaction to the covid-19 vaccine and unknown pain&#34; When I was discharged I had a fever of 100 and on the drive home I was in intense pain. It subsided but I am still not feeling well, I feel very groggy and light headed in addition to the pain.

It stared with loose stools that led to tissue type red stool that did not look like poop. Abdominal pain continued until the next day and I pooped red tissue type stools the next morning. I tried to call the VAERS toll free number and left a message. I had a virtual call with the clinic and was told they did not know of this side effect and to go to the ER.

Mother reports that she had the vaccine, had no symptoms, and then started with a fever that evening of 103.  She was having cold extremities, numbness, tingling of the arms, face, legs.  The fever dropped and went away and was having fatigue and getting winded doing regular activities.  By Monday she continued with the shortness of breath and go increasingly worse as the days went on and also the.  By Wednesday she was having chest pain, numbness and tingling of her extremities and shortness of breath.  She went to the hospital, gave her IVs, says her BP was elevated and sent her home.  Mother told her to sleep and see how she felt.

She was then taken back to the hospital and said that she her BP was high and said that she had the Janssen vaccine, and said that she was hyperventilation due to anxiety.  Once they got her stable and released her again.  Mother asked the doctor if he felt that this was normal, and could see her throat contracting and that she was stable and to go home, and he said yes and that it was anxiety and that sometimes we get ourselves worked up about things and that was causing it.    The daughter has no history of anxiety, no breathing issues.   They did labs and everything was okay, her counts were somewhat off but nothing felt to be abnormal.      She then went to another Hospital as she was still not feeling well, and checked the other reports from the other hospital and they conferred with that information, gave her Valium and sent her home.    As the evening progressed on Friday 4/16/21 she started having chest pains and her girlfriends mother is a nurse and came and saw her and called the mother and told her that she did not like how she was looking, and that her SOB and weakness in her extremities and the tightness in her chest was not right and that she felt that she had a PE.    They took her to another location, she had extremely high calcium levels, and high blood pressure and her heart rate was high and she was admitted.  She has been on flushes to reduce calcium, and her blood levels are improving.  She is on Warfarin to prevent clotting.  She has had a CAT scan and other studies and all were negative.  She felt better yesterday, but she states today that she is not feeling as well, she is nauseous and gave her Zofran,  has a headache, and they gave her something a little stronger than Tylenol.  She is extremely fatigued and weak.    Mother said that she saw her on Sunday 4/18/21 and that she was not able to walk, they had to put her in a wheelchair, and her grandfather walks faster than she can.    They are presently getting her up to get her to walk and see how her strength is, 4/20/21.  They are now waiting to get her levels under control and to see if she is strong enough to go home.

I woke up at 2:00am with a fever of 102.5, a terrible headache and unbearable body aches. I took some ibuprofen and tried to go to bed but began vomiting. This lasted for 3-4 hours and I was unable to sleep. The next day I began to feel better in the afternoon but by 6:00pm the fever and aches worsened again and I began vomiting uncontrollably, about every 10 minutes. I couldn?t keep anything down, even water. I had a virtual urgent care visit and the doctor ordered me to go to the emergency room. At the ER, the doctors determined I was severely dehydrated. I received 2 bags of IV fluid, nausea medicine and pain medicine. I spend about 3 hours in the ER before I was sent home. I had to keep taking nausea medicine to prevent vomiting for the next day or so.

                                                I?m 22 years of age. I?ve been having periods since I was in middle school. I went on birth control when I was 17 years of age. Since being on birth control (5 years now), I haven?t had a single period where I have had heavy symptoms of cramping, bloating, or any unusual pain. I?ve actually been symptom free since starting the pill. The only trends you?ll see with me is starting to eat more during the week. I just had my first peirod since taking the covid Johnson vaccine and have had a nightmare of a period. I?ve been woken up many nights and times with painstaking period cramps and a whole lot of bloating after eating a single thing. This is being my reported because I haven?t changed a single thing in my lifestyle for my period to go crazy. The only thing I have done is put this vaccine into my system. This has lasted for 4 days. I will be reporting my next Period if I have reoccurring symptoms. With the fear of being infertile down the line, I am again reporting this as it should be documented in my medical records. I also have a doctors appointment lined up to discuss further documentation and help on what to do.

She was seated in our observation chair when the friend she was with asked for a trash can because she was feeling nauseous. He stated that she has a phobia on needles, and nausea was common. I went back into the pharmacy after giving her a trash can. I then looked over at the observation chair and her friend stated she was going to pass out. She became stiff and arched back in her chair for a few seconds before slumping forward.  We called EMS while placing an ice pack on the back of her neck. Once the ice pack was in place she became more alert and oriented. She vomited. We placed her laying down on her side until EMS arrived. She was alert and oriented at this time.

I had also drank some ginger and lemon tea before bed due to stomach upset (however I believe that may be linked to my history of digestion issues that are currently going under diagnosis linked to lactose intolerance and food sensitivity). 12:00 AM 3/12/2021: I started to experience a headache, muscular aches, and chills continuing. I made myself a cup of mint tea for the warmth and the addition of the stomach settling aspect of mint.  12:15 AM 3/12/2021: I had a bowel movement and the nausea and stomach upset and gas has begun to pass (making me think that portion is linked to non-related issues of the vaccine, but wanted to note in case your professional opinion thought otherwise!). Chills, aches, and headache still continuing with little shift in extremity. 12:30 AM 3/12/2021

I received the vaccine Friday afternoon 3/12, and around midnight that night (so 3/13 technically) I developed flu like symptoms. I had a mild fever, severe body aches, severe headache, nausea, fatigue, etc. For the entire day of 3/13 I was pretty much bed ridden. Around 5pm on the 13th I took Tylenol and felt a little better and was able to eat something and fall asleep that night. I woke up on the 14th with just a sore arm where I received the shot.

                                                Around 10pm on 3/26, I got a slight headache, but I am not sure if it was due to screen time or a vaccine side effect. Per the clinician that administered the shot, I took 2 tabs of Tylenol (one normal adult dose) with water and went to bed. At 1 am on 3/27, I woke up incredibly sore all over but especially in my joints. I was shivering badly and woke up in a tightly curled fetal position. I was unable to lie still or warm up. I eventually went back to sleep and woke up at 5 am, this time with extreme nausea and threw up everything I had eaten the day before. This went on for a couple of minutes. I was still shivering constantly and sore and achy everywhere. Especially in my knees, shoulders, and lower back. At 6 am, I was still awake and while I still had chills, my face felt hot and I took my temperature twice. First getting 100.74 then 100.86. Slept deeply for the rest of the night. At noon on 3/27 I woke up with no nausea,  body aches but only in my joints but with general soreness everywhere (like after a good workout) and a temp still in the 100.7 degree range. I took 2 Tylenol tabs at 2pm. At 4pm, I only had slight body aches, a headache, and a slight brain fog left and my temp was at 98.7, so no more fever. No further problems showed  up and when I woke up at 9 am on 3/28, I felt absolutely fine other than soreness at the injection site and a little chest tightness which last for about 2 days, through 3/30.

She was very clammy, sweaty, and alert but very groggy when the pharmacists went out to  her. She also stated that her throat felt swollen and sore and that she felt like she was going to throw up. We called the EMS, and she left in the ambulance about 25 minutes after being vaccinated. We don&#39;t have any further update at this time.

                                                patient experienced a wave of nausea, light-headedness, and briefly lost consciousness during vaccination. When she lost consciousness, I supported her weight and she remained in the chair for approx 15 seconds until she regained consciousness. I  had two technicians to assist in calling a code white and documenting the event. At 10:43 am, patient lost consciousness and regained 15 seconds later. Once I knew the patient was stable enough to support her own weight, i held her hands to make sure she was not going to lose consciuosness again. I administered an ice pack and a cool towel at 10:45 am. Code white was responded to by associates from AP and manager. I observed the patient for 15 minutes, and AP associate observed for another 15 minutes for a total of 30 minutes. The patient recovered fully and had a friend drive her home.

She said  she was about to pass out. She was sitting on chair with head leaning back, and resting on the wall. I raised her legs, resting on another chair. About 2 min later, she vomited. About 1 min later, she started to feel better. She asked for water, and we gave her some lukewarm water. Her face started to come back to normal, and she started to feel better and better. She sat for another 20 - 30 min, she felt better and left the pharmacy.

Client said she was feeling warm and her head was throbbing. Client said her name. Client was eventually able to sit up in a chair and said she was feeling hot and lightheaded. Client asked to lay on the floor and legs were placed on a chair. Client said she was feeling better after this. PHN came back to the bathroom with ice pack, fruit strip, water, and apple juice. Client seen throwing up again, vaccinator was standing by with client. Vital signs taken after episode of emesis. BP: 113/84 and HR: 75. Client asked to take deep breaths and slow breathing, which client was able to do. Client said she was still feeling hot so client was given another ice pack. Client felt cold after some time so both ice packs removed. PHN asked another PHN to come assess client and Dr. called in to assess client also. Client was throwing up for the third time, and Dr. suggested we call 911 to get her checked out. EMS called at 1808 by other PHN. Client said she is only allergic to an antidepressant but did not recall the name. Client continued to talk and be responsive throughout entirety of event. Client called someone she knew to pick up her truck as she knew she would be going to the hospital. PHN took down name of friend, his number, and client?s keys. PHN gave keys and information to client flow lead, who gave items to an employee to ensure keys were returned to trusted entity. EMS arrived. Client denied any swelling, throat closing sensation, sensation of a thick tongue, or itching. Client taken on stretcher to Hospital.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. About 1am I woke up short of breath. I sat up in bed to catch my breath and immediately felt nauseous. I went to the bathroom because I thought I was going to throw up but only ended up dry heaving. After sitting for a minute to catch my breath again I started shaking really bad and couldn&#39;t stand up without having blacked out vision. Luckily I grabbed my phone when I went to the bathroom so my mom could come home to help me. Until about 5 am I was shaking going between being extremely hot and extremely cold. After that my body SEVERE:Y ached all day with off and on sweats and headaches. I took Tylenol all day. I started feeling better with just some fatigue around 6pm.

                                                Painful injection but fine for the majority of the day. Started feeling muscle fatigue around 4pm, with upper body aches, stinging eyes, and nausea by 6pm. Fever of 102, and progression to full body aches and headache by 8pm in addition to the aforementioned symptoms that continued throughout the night. Fever lowered to 99 and only minor body aches by mid morning on the 12th. Headache continued throughout the day with low grade fever. I predict that I will feel 100% better within 48 hours.

                                                I received the shot at 14:30, in which medical staff in the jail&#39;s medical center watched me for 20 minutes to ensure there were no immediate reactions. I went about my day afterward with no symptoms. At 21:30 when I went to sleep, I got some aches in my joints and took 1 dose of liquid capsule NyQuil to help with the pain and went to sleep. At 00:30, the 7th, I woke up groaning in my sleep to the extreme pain in my joints and feeling hot internally. I decided to get up and take a warm bath to ease the aches. I went and ran the bath and all of a sudden while it was running, I had a severe need to throw up, but could not naturally. Since this was concerning, I got up and walked out of the bathroom and all of a sudden in the hall I got a feeling of impending doom and that something was not right and I fainted. I laid on the floor for what I would approximate to be 5 minutes going in and out of consciousness waiting for the blood to fully return to the brain. After this, I instantly felt like I needed to survive and that I felt like I could be dying so I slowly crawled down the stairs to get to my military ID so I could call the military&#39;s nurse advice line. I had to take a break and lay on the concrete in my garage because I felt so dizzy and so hot and began to feel my vision disappear like I was going to faint again. I waited a few minutes before getting back up the stairs crawling to my phone to call. When I called them 00:58, they told me to call 911 because they believed I would be having a severe reaction, though I noted to them I did not have a rash or hives. I then called 911 at 01:08. They sent EMT&#39;s to my home which took my vitals. I had normal blood pressure, SPo2, and temp, but an elevated heart rate of just under 100 and a high respiration rate. EMT&#39;s made the decision for me to stay home since the hospital did not seem immediate in their opinion. After this I stayed on the couch for a few minutes and then felt very tired so I walked slowly to my room and fell asleep. I woke up at 06:00 for work, and arrived at 07:00. In the hour after waking up I was achy, sweating, and felt light headed. I got to work and my Sergeant told me to go home and sleep. I slept another 5 hours at 08:00 and when I woke up most of my symptoms went away other than aches and getting flush very easily for 5 days.  At this current time all I notice is some random light headedness that quickly resolves and comes a few times a day at random and without cause.

I first fainted at around 4:00 AM on March 24, 2021 after waking up. My parents carried me down the stairs and I fainted again after that. I didn&#39;t receive any treatment afterwards. I had a fever for the entire day and was feeling dizzy and nauseous for most of that day. I haven&#39;t fainted since then but still feel a little bit dizzy every once in a while.

On April 12th I had a fever and woke up with red little dots around my eyes.  At night the fever went away. The following day April 13th I felt my chest tight and had shortness of breath throughout the day. I also had stomach pains at times.  April 14th and 15th (today) my chest still feels tight and I get tired very easily.  My arm is also still very sore and sensitive, I have a little bump where the vaccine was put in.

                                                Immediately after receiving the shot I began to have fairly intense pain at injection site. It continued in waves. I began to walk around the store for the allotted 15 minutes. I began to feel very dizzy and faint. My ears began ringing and I didn?t feel well. I stumbled back to the pharmacy to ask for help. At this point I was also feeling like it was very hard to breathe. I explained all these symptoms to the pharmacists on duty and they told me to just sit down. After sitting down I still felt faint but suddenly felt the need to vomit. I stumbled to the bathroom where I collapsed in front of the toilet and passed out twice, striking my head and throat on the bowl. After awaking I was very disoriented and felt very hot and clammy. The pharmacist then came and found me and told me to once again sit down and continue waiting. After sitting down for about 5 more minutes I began to feel less dizzy and was having an easier time breathing. I left the store as the pharmacist was ignoring me and didn?t seem concerned about my symptoms. After arriving home I was tired and week and very very cold. I noted my body temp was lower than usual. I took a nap and then these symptoms continued for about 24 hours. I am now feeling much better.

                                                Patient was very nervous about getting the covid vaccine. She sat for 15 minutes and after about 8 minutes she said she thought she was having a panic attack and felt hot. Tech administered vaccine and sat with her the whole wait time since she was nervous. Held an ice pack on her neck when she stated she felt hot. The 15 minute timer went off and she still felt nervous so she continued to sit. Rph also was present once the ice pack was given.  She had a dry heave at about 12 minutes. After 20 minutes we moved her to the floor she said she was seeing light flashes.  She was sweaty and hot. BP was taken at 420pm 162/109 and 98 pulse. Asked pt if we could call an ambulance, she felt she didn&#39;t need one. We got lead from Division 1, also suggested an ambulance and this time pt said ok.  Now BP taken was 157/109 and pulse 108.  Patient felt a dry heave and we put her on her side.  Ambulance arrived and put pt on a stretcher.

I had complications with the insulin and the shot was causing my sugar to rise and there were complication. I was not able to lay on my left for a week longer maybe a little longer.

Right away after the shot I passed out and when I came to, I threw up a couple of times. I was taken to the ER and I had low potassium levels were low, but all other tests were normal. I had some aches pains and feverishness for a couple of days. Five days after the vaccine I had bad diarrhea several times a day. I was nauseous and feeling bad. I had an appointment with my GI doctor a week later but I had to go to the ER before that. They did not find anything in most tests. The next day I tested positive for CDIFF. I was prescribed antibiotics. I went back to the ER a third time because the Vancomycin prescription had caused severe nausea. I am still feeling bad after six weeks but it has gotten better.

                                                About 8 hours after receiving the vaccine, my body started hurting, I got intense chills, and I became exhausted. 13 hours post vaccine, I had a fever of 101.6, I began vomiting, I was sweating, I was trembling, and had diarrhea. The vomiting lasted for about 2 hours. Also, I was vomiting up small amounts of blood. About 24 hours post-shot, my entire body was sore, I still had chills and sweats,  I had a fever of 101.2, fatigue and a headache.  Day 2 after the shot, I was still extremely fatigued and sore. Day 3, I began to feel better. I was still fatigued, but the only soreness was in the arm that I got the vaccine along with some redness around the injection site. I also had no fever. Day 4,  my injection site was a little sore, I was slightly fatigued, and a small rash was on one of my arms for most of the day, but then the rash faded.

I had a fever (slight) and chills and was nauseous. Put  ONDANSETRON -4 mg. The nausea didn&#39;t go away and I couldn&#39;t eat or drink without vomiting until today. I couldn&#39;t eat or drink or was very tired and groggy and miserable. Today I  had another trip to the ER Medical, I got on an antibiotic and anti-nausea medication (GETHALEXIN - 500 mg for the GI) (METOCLOPRAMIGE HCL - 5 mg-  for nausea) from the hospital and I had a shot that went into my immune system. They also found a UTI today.

                                                After about 6 hours of receiving the shot, I woke up with uncontrollable chills, and hot flashes in between, where my chest, back and face felt hot but hands and feet were ice cold. I had a fever of 99.9 and had a headache across the front of the face and nauesa. All of this lasted together for about 6 to 7 hours. During this time I took Tyenol, used cold compress, wrapped up in blankets and sipped on water. After the chills and hot flashes subsided I continued to feel fatigue,and had  head and body aches for the next 18-24 hours. During this time I continued with Tyenol and fluids. In all it last about 36 hours before I felt like myself again.

Shortly felt a burning feeling in my chest and  collar bones, that spread to my head. My head started to burn, it felt like it was on fire, along with my neck and chest. I felt dizzy, like i was going to faint, the burning and dizziness lasted for about 5 minutes. Shortly after i felt like my throat closed up and I was having very labored breaths. The burning feeling in my body and dizziness came back, along with not feeling like i could breathe well. I went to an ER, they gave me an IV with Benadryl, and I started to feel well enough 2 hours later to go home.

                                                About 5 hours after my vaccine I had already been asleep for around 30 minutes when I was startled awake by my own rapid heartbeat, it was beating so fast and hard that I could hear it and it woke me up. I reviewed my literature about the vaccine I received at the pharmacy and saw this reaction could be due to an allergic reaction but as an uninsured person I had to just wait it out to see if it would go away. I drank a lot of water and started developing a headache but my heart rate finally slowed down enough that I was no longer alarmed, but it was still faster than usual. I went back to sleep around 2am only to awake once again around 5am because I had begun to experience the worst body aches I?ve ever felt as well as nausea and a pounding headache. I live on a semi truck with no bathroom so my fiancé had to take me to my parents house so I would have access to a bathroom. I took ibuprofen and Tylenol for my pain and took 6 showers in 24 hours just to soothe my body aches. It felt worse than any flu I?ve ever had (I received the flu vaccine back in January if that matters). I was extremely ill and had no appetite and pretty much just slept and cried for about 36 hours total, but yesterday afternoon I finally felt a little better although still experiencing a terrible headache. Today I woke up feeling completely fine. I just wanted to report my side effects.

Continued to vomit all day probably because of the fever.  Gave liquids only. By 9:00 pm fever fluctuating 99 to normal.  Hopefully by 4/2 all symptoms will have passed.  I did not take her to the doctor for this although when the symptoms started I was very concerned because she does not speak and I didn?t know if she was having chest pains.

                                                At around 9:15 PM I started to feel nauseous and got out of bed to go to the bathroom. While using the bathroom I felt a very strong chill come over my whole body and started shivering and got directly back into bed and wrapped myself up in a thick blanket. For 45 minutes I laid wrapped up and was shivering constantly. At 10 pm I was brought extra blankets and a heating pad but moving to get situated caused dizziness. It was about 10:30 when the shivering stopped. I was able to sleep but got up to go got the bathroom around midnight and my entire body was drained of energy and I felt that I could barely stand and walk on my own. I was dizzy and my head hurt as well. I could barely hold my arms up to look at my phone briefly. Between 11 PM and 2 AM I had 5 or 6 high heart rate alerts (over 120) according to my Apple Watch but I did not wake up to them. In the morning (Sunday 4/4/21) around 9-10 am my head still hurt and my body was very achy and I felt very hungover. All day I continued to feel achy almost with a bad cold or a minor flu. Today has been better but I have still felt pretty drained. I?ve had continuous arm soreness in the arm I got the injection - but nothing too severe.   15 minutes after my vaccine on Saturday 4/3/21 I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and around midnight of that night I took 2 of pain relief PM acetaminophen (1000 mg of acetaminophen total snd 50 mg of diphenhydramine HCI total)

The only thing that made it better was walking but lying down or sitting felt like the worst thing in the world. Nausea much later in the night and my heart rate was higher than normal for the most part. My resting rate is usually 57-62 bpm but this time it was ranging between 100-108bpm. Arm soreness  Back pain was mostly felt on the left side and accompanied by leg pain. I?ve had back pain in the past but this was x100 worse to the point where I considered going to the ER. My final symptoms were nausea but waking up this morning I feel fine

                                                I started experiencing side effects about 6 hours after receiving the vaccine. I experienced chills, sweating, 99.5 fever, headache, head pounding, dizziness, nausea,  tiredness, sore body, sore left arm, and had trouble sleeping. I took two Motrin pills and felt a little better and was able to sleep. In the morning, I woke up tired, sweating, had a sore left arm and sore body so I took two more Motrin pills and am feeling mostly better. Fever, headache, head pounding, dizziness, and nausea are gone.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccine (04/05/2021), I became very tired, but otherwise had no adverse reactions. I went to bed around 9 pm, and at around 3 am the next morning (04/06/2021), I woke up with severe chills, body aches, a pressure headache, and some mild nausea (I believe caused by the headache) that lasted through until early afternoon. Taking ibuprofen seemed to help the body and headaches, but it seemed like it was difficult to regulate my body temperature. I couldn&#39;t tell if I was too hot or too cold, and trying to remedy one or the other made me either too cold or too hot, respectively. All effects completely cleared up by 04/07/2021.

                                                Got the shot at 9:20am on Saturday (April 10th). By the time I sat down to do the 15min waiting period before I could leave. My arm from the back of my shoulder all the way down to around my thumb joint in my hand ached so bad. By around 3pm on the same day, I started to feel really tired and had a pounding migraine. By 4:30p I started to get really cold and everything started to ache. By 6p I was feeling hot but at the same time cold and shivering. My head was pounding. Every muscle ached all over my body, and by every muscle I mean even my eye muscles and pelvic floor muscles. My face had so much sinus pressure that it felt like it could explode. My skin, all over my body, was so sensitive that it hurt to the touch. On top of my skin being sensitive to the touch, off and on my skin would tingle, including the inside of my mouth and tongue. My lymph nodes were swollen enough in my neck that my throat ached.  I was mentally confused and shaking. Everything got bad enough I started crying and hyperventilating. I felt sick to my stomach and felt digestive pain. My entire body felt so heavy. By the time it got to around 8p, my mom finally took my temperature, which at that point I had already been taking Tylenol all day and was no longer shivering, and I had a temperature of 101 degrees F. I finally went to bed around 9p. I was thirsty but my stomach felt sick. I still ached and woke up around 10 times throughout the night either feeling too hot or cold or hurting so bad. At 4am I took a Tylenol because it everything hurt bad enough to able to fall asleep. The next day. I mostly better. I was still tired and a little achy and my lymph nodes under my arm pits were swollen. At this point my lungs felt strange. Harder to breathe than normal.  I was starting to cough. The day after that (today) I have felt fairly normal except I?m coughing and my lungs still feel a little strained. No more aches or fever or anything like that though.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Immediately after receiving the vaccine, I had no side effects. The following morning, my arm hurt and I felt a bit tired, but other than that normal. About 27 hours after I received the vaccine, I had severe stomach pain. I ended up vomiting and having diarrhea at the same time, for an hour. Immediately following this, I was very feverish, and I got the chills horribly for about an hour. I was very tired for the next 48 hours, but Tylenol alleviated the fever and headache.

Passed out, unconscious within 5 minutes of receiving the shot. Could not sit up/dizzy for 30 minutes. Nausea, weakness, dizzy, poor mental acuity/memory. Later that night, and through the night for 10 hours, severe back pain. Nausea, severe weakness, dizzy, poor mental acuity and memory, sweats and chills.  The next day (day immediately after receiving vaccine) symptoms continued but lessened by 5 pm. Each day since then, the symptoms have ALL remained in a more mild form. Today is day 6 and I still have moderate back pain and occasional sweats, weakness and fatigue.

                                                Felt generally unwell 12 hours after the vaccination: onset of headache and body aches. During the night, fever spiked to 103 degrees, had uncontrollable shakes, chills, cold sweats, dizziness, and mild nausea. This lasted roughly 48 hours. After 48 hours, fever was reduced, body aches remained, but other symptoms subsided. I continue to feel generally unwell with body aches and a slight fever. In retrospect, I should have gone to the hospital.

Sometimes in knees, mostly in calves... continued until midway through the night) - fatigue (felt just a little more tired than normal, really tired by bed time: 9pm) - heightened heart rate (excitement from vaccine / apprehension for potential illness?) Second day - Thursday:  - fatigue (tired all day, almost fell asleep through a couple meetings) - leg pain (reappeared in the morning, ached and throbbed. Made it difficult to relax. Was gone around 3/4pm) - headache (probably from dehydration, I was warm, but not completely a fever. Attempted to drink a lot of water, but too much made me nauseous)  - chills (sporadic, barely noticeable except it agitated the headache) - nausea (I barely ate more than a granola bar and attempted to drink water and tea, but too much made me sick, especially if it had sugar - mainly drank water. Had some soup later in the day (6pm) and most of the nausea went away)

                                                I was running on the treadmill and all of the sudden my feet started tingling. I got off the treadmill to try to massage my feet. Then, I felt nauseous and vomited. After vomiting I could not move and I had very hard time walking. I noticed that my face had swollen, my throat was closing, and my vision was blurry. I also broke out in hives. Once I could get mobile (about two hours after the adverse reaction started) I took a Benadryl and that helped ease the swelling.

I woke up at 3am with intense body aches/ chills/sweats, felt like I had a cabin fever for the entire day of April 9th. I felt dizzy,  had a headache, my eyes aches and very very fatigued and couldn?t eat. Night of April 9th I started to not feel so dizzy but I was very very hot and could not cool down. Ever since April 10th I?ve have runny/stuffy nose/ body aches, sore throat, I developed a cough week of April 12th, eyes ached and very very fatigued. Today, April 21st, I am still a little fatigued, little soar throat, but runny/stuff nose still, and body soreness/aches.

                                                Two weeks after the vaccine I had an extremely sore throat in the afternoon. It was hard to swallow but it was also painful all the time. I went to the doctor and got a Strep test and Covid-19 test which were negative. I just took Advil and it lessened the pain. I still have a tender throat especially in the morning and when I work out. It has been a week and it does seem to be getting better.

                                                Two hours after the vaccine I felt bad. I had fatigue and a very sharp headache, chills and muscle and joint pain. The headache was very painful. I took Tylenol and used ice packs. I was still experiencing fatigue, nausea and headaches for tow weeks after the shot. The fatigue was very severe and I had no energy. Several weeks after the vaccine I was still very fatigued, and my depression was getting worse. I felt fine before the vaccine and my medication was working. My dosage was increased and it helped with the symptoms. It seems to have stabilized now  after eight weeks.

                                                A couple hours after getting the J&amp;J vaccine, I experienced extreme cramping and a light/medium flow of blood from my vagina. The cramps were very painful - on a scale of 1 to 10, an 8. I have been bleeding ever since. Sometimes there will be only be a drop or two of blood that comes out for a couple hours but usually it is much more than that. It&#39;s like I&#39;m on my period, but I am not. I have an IUD and also am on the birth control pill (Junel). I am not on the placebo week on my birth control pill pack, so I should not be experiencing a period right now, but ever since the shot, I have been bleeding and experiencing intense cramps and pain since.

                                                I received the Johnson&amp;Johnson vaccine on Friday, May 28th...within 6 hours of receiving it, I was experiencing nausea, chills and fever. It rapidly progressed within 3 hours to the point where my entire left side was numb and I had foot droop, slurred speech and a severe migraine, often associated with a stroke. I was immediately taken to the ER where a CT of my brain, labs, and EKGs were performed due to symptoms I was experiencing closely related to neurological issues. All came back normal, but my left side numbness didn?t subside, nor did any other symptoms mentioned above, even with medications. I was transferred to another hospital to see a neurologist where they ordered an MRI of the brain and more labs and admission into the hospital for observation. Everything came back normal again but still unable to walk and use my left side. It came down to a diagnosis of a hemiplegic migraine, which is a rare and serious form of a migraine with symptoms mimicking a stroke. I was discharged 3 days later and was told to follow up with my primary care doctor and neurologist for further long term care....4 days later and I?m finally able to walk but definitely no where?s near my normal self. Very weak and experiencing many migraines a day

My lips and fingers were blue. I was incredibly cold, shaking and simultaneously felt hot. I also almost blacked-out. The shaking lasted for about an hour. I continued to feel sick and exhausted for about a week, but felt much better after the first day.

                                                Starting the day of the shot, I had chills and heat flashes, often back to back along with muscle pain. Starting June 12th, I had random shaking of my right arm, so much so that I believed the baby in my lap was having a seizure, only to realize it was my arm. It happened every few minutes daily, however, I was out of town and didn?t know of any places to report it. I have video footage of the shaking. Since then, if I get excited or nervous about anything, I feel a sensation that I can only describe as my blood vibrating. I quickly calm myself and it goes away. Other than that, I have persistent stomach pain whenever I eat. It?s a pain I?ve never felt before and don?t know how to describe it. It takes place right above my navel and lasts for what I assume is the duration of me eating.

                                                I woke up noticing a slight headache, but I figured it was from poor sleep the night prior. I noticed after breakfast that I felt really cold and felt an internal shiver, especially in my chest. My fingers and toes were ice cold even with a sweater, blanket, and a warm tea. I noticed my skin starting to feel tender and I felt very fatigued. I wanted knew I needed to eat so that I could take ibuprofen, but I experienced a loss of appetite. I had a mild cough, but I felt too tired to even cough. I rocked in a chair in the sunlight outside for about 15 minutes and still felt cold. When I took my oral temperature after coming inside, I was reading 99.9. I took 400mg of Ibuprofen by 1130 and layed down to rest. Bundled in 3 layers, I felt the shivering couldn&#39;t stop. My headache got worse and my skin was tender to the touch. I was able to sleep for approximately 3 hours and I woke up drenched in sweat. I took my oral temperature again and was at 101.1. I drank some more water and tried to sleep some more. When I woke up around 4:30 pm, I felt a lot better. My temperature went down to 97.8 and I had a boost in energy and appetite. I no longer had a headache and I had only mild muscle aches. By the next morning, I felt completely normal again.

I started getting really cold, took my temperature and it was at 100.1. Got a headache, slightly nauseous, body aches got a lot worse (particularly my lower back). I was also feeling a little dizzy and having a hard time comprehending information; this was probably the fever. Around 8pm,  I took my temperature again and it had risen to 102. I took some extra strength Tylenol which started helping about 30 minutes later. I woke up 3/12/2021 still with some body aches, slight headache, and slight stomachache.

Every-time I stand up it jumps to 116. My resting heart rate was 113 for 8hours straight Monday night. So the j&amp;j website lists that as an allergic reaction. The urgent care basically said wait it out and be careful cuz if I move like too fast I could pass out again cuz of the blood pressure

                                                I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine at 8:30AM on Friday, March 26. The only symptoms I experienced until that evening were mild soreness at the injection site, mild stiffness/soreness in my left arm and my neck, and mild body aches. At 6:00PM that day, I was driving and experienced sudden-onset nausea and dizziness. I experienced tunnel vision and my vision began to black out. I was able to pull off the road and began retching and dry heaving. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my lips and then in my right hand, each of which lasted for about a minute. The nausea lasted for 5-10 minutes, after which it dissipated and I started experiencing chills. After returning home, around 9:30PM I experienced a severe headache and a return of sudden-onset nausea. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my right hand again, which disappeared after about 5 minutes. I retched and dry heaved again, and I took two Advil. The nausea passed and I was able to go back to sleep. The next morning, the nausea had completely disappeared,  and the only lingering symptoms were a mild headache and mild stiffness/body aches.

Approximately 5 hours after recieving the vaccine I started feeling extremely tired and cold despite the climate being warmer than usual. I went to sleep and woke up shivering, i was cold but my body was burning to the touch. My body ached and I had a headache and nausea. My eyes hurt whenever I moved them. These symptoms persisted until 9:18, I took 2 tylenol pills and started feeling better. Today is my third day, my eye pain has not gone and I still feel tired but what is bothering the most is the eye pain whenever I look anywhere or move my head.

                                                Started to feel tired a few hours after the vaccine with slight aches. I had a fever by the time I went to bed. The entire night was spent tossing and turning, drenched in sweat while simultaneously feeling like I was on fire. On top of this I had a massive headache. Today is the day after and my fever has gone down throughout the day, but it is pretty bad. I still have a headache and also vomited a few times today. I have been taking acetaminophen and took some pepto bismol. I was able to start eating later in the day.

I felt foggy and &#34;off&#34; at this time, like my head isn&#39;t clear. There has also been constant aching at the site of injection in my left arm.

                                                I walked up the stairs to go to bed at 10:45pm and started feeling very dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseous. At the top of the stairs I passed out and fell backwards. Not sure exactly how long I was out, but no more than a few minutes. When I woke up I was disoriented and nauseous but didn&#39;t have the strength to get up. I rolled into my side and vomited 3 times. My fiance helped me get up slowly. He took my temp but I did NOT have a fever. The nausea, dizziness, and lightheadedness subsided after about 10 minutes, so I decided to NOT seek medical attention. This morning I have a headache and body aches in my lower back and left arm.

Starting immediately and over the next 10 minutes I felt dizzy and lightheaded, as if I were about to pass out. I also felt nauseous. I recovered fully about 15 minutes later, and I didn?t think to notify the staff.

Fever lasted approximately 12 hours, and included heavy chills and sweating. Extreme fatigue, weakness, and dizziness. Metallic taste in mouth. Body aches, and especially soreness in the left arm (injection site). Loss of appetite. By 24 hours after the vaccine injection, almost all symptoms were gone, but soreness in left arm persisted. About 26 hours after the vaccine, I had extreme acid reflux which lasted a few hours. In the two days since the vaccine I&#39;ve experienced a ringing in my left ear.

                                                Vaccine was done at 2:50. Around 6pm I started getting a headache, neck pain and my lymph nodes were enlarged. Took 1000mg of Tylenol. At 1030 pm, I started getting all over muscle spasms, headache returned, onset of dizziness, nausea and uncontrollable shaking. At 1145pm, I started vomiting, the muscle spasms got increasing  worse, the shaking only decreased while in the bath tub in very hot water. No fever was noted with thermometer, but after a second dose of 1000mg of Tylenol at 1am, I broke out profusely sweating 30 minutes later.  The uncontrollable shaking stoped at about 4am, along with the nausea and vomiting.  Upon waking up the next day, muscle spasms were still there as well as the headache and dizziness. By end of day 4-10-21 (today) all symptoms have resolved but the headache.

At approximately 3:30 p.m. that same day of the shot that I received, I started experiencing flu like symptoms such as severe aches throughout my body and hot flashes. My body was also significantly shaking as I would randomly become very cold and achy when I wasn?t having hot flashes. I also had a severe headache. Slight pain on the injection site, but not horrible. The day after the shot, I feel weak and nauseous.

                                                I had nausea, vomiting, chills, fever (up to 103F) before taking a fever reducer, body aches, fatigue, I couldn&#39;t stand for very long with out feeling nauseous. My left arm still hurts more than the rest of my body but I still have some body aches too. The chills started around 7:30 on the 10th and while I still have pain from body aches it now feels like a really hard workout from the gym. I was able to break my fever for good by the 12th and regain my appetite.

Approximately 8 hours after receiving the shot, severe and sudden nausea occurred, causing the patient to violently vomit in the middle of the night.   Patient awoke the next morning, about 15 hours after receiving the shot, with body aches, chills, minor low grade fever, headache, and dehydration. After 24 hours, the patient felt fine.

Onsite paramedics stated blood sugar, blood pressure, and pulse were within normal range after sitting on stretcher for 15 minutes. I signed a release refusing transport to hospital as i was feeling better. Throughout the first day I started feeling tired and sore but that was to be expected. Following day 4/11, extremely nauseous, headache, body aches and typical flu like symptoms, low grade fever of 100-101. At roughly 9:45 am and again at 11:25 am started throwing up bile/stomach acid.  Flu like symptoms did not subside until morning of 4/13.

Meanwhile, my sister had the same vaccine at the same time as me (she is 2 years younger), and she had the opposite psychological reaction?weepiness, lack of energy, sadness. These symptoms went away when we went to sleep that night. For the next few days, we had flu-like symptoms (aches, fatigue, intermittent nausea).

After 2 hours, I started experiencing severe body aches (primarily in my knees and back) and a headache, my body temperature felt as thought it was changing from cold to hot frequently, and my temperature rose to 103.6 for about 1.5-2 hours. It finally decreased to about 102 and remained there for about 6 more hours. I had trouble getting up to use the restroom and would feel very dizzy, my temperature dropped midday to about 100. My fever finally broke about 24 hours after my vaccine, but I still lost my appetite and was experiencing body aches and a headache. I couldn&#39;t eat anything for about 48 hours after my vaccine, I was able to take small sips of water to help stay hydrated. It took until Saturday (5 days after my vaccine) to feel back to normal. I felt very puffy and swollen the entire week following my vaccine and was very fatigued.

I decided trying to take Tylenol to help alleviate my pain would just come back up as vomit. Within the next hour I had became increasingly nauseous and my hand started to cramp up and go numb. I couldn&#39;t move my hands. My husband then decided to call the E.R. and ask if this was a common reaction and they recommended we come in. We got to the hospital and my left hand had started getting feeling back and moving but my right hand had not. They preformed a neurological test and ruled out a stroke and that it was happening on both sides of my body. The ended up giving me a dose of tordol and a shot of antihistamines and sent me home with a prescription for ibuprofen.

When she  came to the pharmacist gave her some orange juice.  It didn&#39;t help and she  was very nauseous.  When  she got up to leave she was totally incoherent, was unable to walk on her own.  When she got home she was no better so I first called our family doctor which both said take her to the ER.  There they did many tests and they all came back fine so they sent her home.  By that evening she was able to walk on her own and talking right.  She was terribly tired and still today 4/14 she is feeling worse but still not 100%. With the pause today for this vaccine we are very worried about this.

                                                About 7 minutes of receiving my J&amp;J vaccine, I started to feel nauseous while sitting down and waiting for my fifteen minutes of monitoring. I experienced pain in my left arm and my heart was beating fast. My vision was in and out, started seeing black and white spots. I then got up from my chair and I went to the counter and as I was talking to the clerk telling her I did not feel good, I just went down and fainted. I had fainted and when I came back, woke up a nurse was trying t put an epi-pen on me but I told her I did not need it. They called the ambulance and they monitored me there. The EMT said to me that my blood pressure had dropped and I had had a &#34;vasovagal syncope&#34; and that my body probably went into shock. I did not go to the hospital and went home. For the rest of the day I felt ill, and out of it. I also felt pain, an aching pain to the right buttocks region. The next day I still felt not good. Also I have noticed since the J&amp;J vaccine, I had my menstrual cycle but normally my menstrual cycle lasts 5 days now this month it only lasted about 4 hours and I this concerns me.  Before this vaccine, I did not have experience these symptoms.

                                                Until ~5PM adverse events were extremely trivial -- mainly I &#34;felt stupid&#34;. Starting about 5PM, I started feeling bad -- stomachache, strong muscle cramps primarily in the right leg (*not blood clot), and I staggered around dumbly much like a severe fever victim (*I had no actual fever). My period started about a week and a half early (typically only varies by a day or two) and was extremely thick and black, tar-like (typically is bloodlike -- reddish and watery). I did not suffer any unusual amount of period pain.  Symptoms worsened sharply between 9:30-10PM, when I became extremely sensitive to light and sound and lost emotional control almost entirely. From 10PM to 4 or 5 AM, in pitch dark and total silence, I laid in my bed raging at the &#39;excessive brightness and noise&#39;.   The next day (5/2) my emotional state returned almost to normal, but I was still &#34;stupid&#34;, and the leg cramps continued. I spent most of the day sleeping. I also drank obscene amounts of tea that I didn&#39;t urinate out, so I would assume that if I wasn&#39;t chugging tea like a frat boy on a keg during spring break, I would have suffered dehydration.  On 5/3 my mental state returned basically to normal. The leg cramps continued. Presumptive dehydration period ended.  On 5/4 the leg cramps began to subside, and my period became more normal (bloodlike, watery). On 5/5 the leg cramps and period ended.
