I went to the ER two weeks ago but there was no concern because there were no blood clots. Now my bowel is restricted and I&#39;ve had auto-immune issue about a year and a half ago. Now just cramps and bloating. I also have a tooth that&#39;s come loose and I have a strange taste in my mouth since having the vaccine. I saw the doctor and they just called and the doctor stated that I&#39;ve continue to have problems I should consider having an ultrasound of my stomach. Also, in the past, I went to Hospital.

Same symptoms as my daughter (she has filed a report).   Saw Dr. at PCP office on Monday, June 7th.  Blood tests requested.  Stool Sample requested.  Awaiting results. Since my daughter and myself both came down with same symptoms within 24 hours of each other we were instructed to complete this form and we have been discussing possibility of food poisoning with our PCPs.  Still have nausea, chills, abdominal pain.  Bloody stools have stopped for me.

Jumped in a hot shower for 15 minutes and that went away.  I thought maybe my blood pressure had dropped too low; had same reaction when first put on too much blood pressure lowering medication.  Or sometimes allergy makes the blood pressure drop.

I laid back down asap due to slight nausea.  No appetite. Whites of eyes were uniformly pink, eyes glassy.  3/23  Sore spot  to the touch on left temple just above the eyebrow.

It was as if I was falling in space, especially my head. Could  not sit up without feeling terrible. Lessened somewhat during day but could not move head without feeling vertigo/dizziness.  Unable to eat without nausea and vomiting.  That was 04/09/21. On 04/10 and 04/11 it was difficult to arise from bed without feeling very dizzy. But after getting up very slowly without moving head, I could move slowly to use  bathroom, get a little food, etc.  Today, 04/12, still had to arise from bed very slowly, trying not to move head to avoid weird dizzy type feeling.  Have been able to eat, get dressed and leave the house carefully. Try not to move head too much and move rather slowly.

I went to bed and didn&#39;t feel good, the next day I still didn&#39;t feel good. I got so chilled again and nausea and went back to the ER and say the same Dr. and took my Blood work again and said my blood work was better than the night before. I also had a fever and they told me to take Tylenol and it was just a side effect.  I feel so weak and sick at my stomach still.

Patient had difficulty swallowing, tingling on tongue, and got the jitters about 10-15 mins post dose.  She was recommended by her PCP to try the Johnson and Johnson vaccine because of this allergy.   We had discussion with an ID specialist and pharmacy manager to go ahead and give the vaccine after weight the risks/benefits.  A pharmacist was there to monitor the patient and about 15 minutes post dose, patient had difficulty swallowing and noted that this was a very similar onset to when she received the Moderna vaccine.  A code blue was called, patient was sent up on stretcher to the ER.  Patient received steroids (methylprednisolone) , famotidine, and Benadryl while in the ER.  Currently being monitored in the ER.
