Jumped in a hot shower for 15 minutes and that went away.  I thought maybe my blood pressure had dropped too low; had same reaction when first put on too much blood pressure lowering medication.  Or sometimes allergy makes the blood pressure drop. For 24 hours after that I was on the couch or in bed lying down;  brain hurt(BAD headache), stiff neck, a big effort to lift my head off the pillow so I didn&#39;t unless I had to go to the bathroom.  I laid back down asap due to slight nausea.  No appetite. Whites of eyes were uniformly pink, eyes glassy.  3/23  Sore spot  to the touch on left temple just above the eyebrow.

I called my neighbor and took me to the ER . They ran Blood test and urine test and everything was ok. They told me i was a side effect for the vaccine and sent me home. I went to bed and didn&#39;t feel good, the next day I still didn&#39;t feel good. I got so chilled again and nausea and went back to the ER and say the same Dr. and took my Blood work again and said my blood work was better than the night before. I also had a fever and they told me to take Tylenol and it was just a side effect.  I feel so weak and sick at my stomach still.
