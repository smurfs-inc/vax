                                                I started to lose mobility in my left arm the evening of my vaccine appointment. The following morning, I could not raise my arm at all. The pain in my upper left arm (where the vaccine was administered) has been severe for more than 48 hours. It is extremely painful to the touch. I can use my left hand, but cannot function/cannot perform necessary daily work and school tasks due to the loss of mobility. I have been in extreme pain and fear my shoulder has been injured.

Her dizziness became worse and I got the Epi Pen ready.   A few minutes later, she asked to lie down due to her dizziness.   I assisted her and had my tech call 911.   She had no trouble breathing but did develop tingling in her hands and a blotchy red rash on her chest.  The paramedics arrived and checked her vitals which they said were fine.  They took her out to the ambulance as a precaution.

                                                Experienced light headedness ( started before time stated but not sure when exactly). Around 6:30pm-7pm I began feeling dizzy, going between dizzy and light headed. I was drinking plenty fluids and did eat. A few people noted that I looked very out of it, and I felt very out of it. I tried staying seated and this did not have any effect on the dizzy feeling. I went to lay down and before going to sleep around 10pm-11pm, laying in bed I felt like the room was spinning. I also had typical symptoms, soreness as injections site and arm (starting immediately the day of vaccine), fever at it&#39;s highest was 102 (starting at 100.5 that morning, not peaking until Motrin wore off*see below*), feeling tired and very heavy.. like everywhere was waited down by something (starting early in the morning).  I was given Motrin by my coworker in the morning as I was had a headache  and was feeling sore and moving sore due to heavy feeling. Wednesday waking up the dizziness  and lightheadedness were gone. A slight feeling of being out of it however, fever was about 99-100 throughout the day (99 being my typical temp). As of today only a feeling of sore arm and tiredness which sometimes feels like I and out of it but I feel both from later yesterday and today is due to the tired feeling that comes common.

                                                12 hours after vaccine around 3:30am on Saturday I woke up with sever chills, shaking uncontrollably for an hour or 2. I fell back to sleep and woke up about an hour later burning up and sore head to toe. I threw up and had a migraine that lasted the rest of the day. I was able to fall asleep around 6:30am and when I woke up around 9 I was just exhausted, sore all over, nauseous, with a headache. This lasted about a day. On sunday afternoon my toddler lightly hit my right arm where the vaccine was and it became sore, red, and swollen. By the late evening that day the soreness and redness increased. Monday-Thursday the redness and swelling increased to about 2 inches round and felt very tight with a lump in the swelling and it was warm to the touch. By friday the redness and swelling reduced to about an inch, but there is still an inch small lump at the injection site and hurts when anything touches it. The redness has faded and there is no visual bruising.

I came out of it within 10 minutes. 16 hours later I had a 102 fever. Took Tylenol Felt fine 24 hours later 32 hours later I started to get a headache and light sensitivity. Fever back to over 99- low grade for me.  35 hours later I had such a bad headache and light sensitivity. I couldn?t watch tv, be on my phone, or look at a computer screen. I also started to get bouts of nausea. 38 hours later, I vomited for the first time. Same symptoms as what I described last. 42 hours later, I vomited again. 48 hours later - 5 days later, light sensitivity and  migraine symptoms continued , but improved slowly each day.               6 days later, all previous symptoms were gone. I woke up with a bump in my inner eye. Slowly went away throughout the day, then developed a itchy, red bump in between my lips and nose, that progressively got bigger throughout the day and made my lip swell. Bump was about 2 inches in diameter at its biggest. Took Claritin, cleaned face with alcohol, and by 24 hours later it was not noticeable.  8 days later, the bump appeared again in between lip and nose on the opposite side of my face.  Took Benadryl, bump slowly went down throughout the day. By 24 hours later it was gone

                                                On Sunday morning i woke up to my left arm being swollen, red, hot to the touch. Over the course of the next few days the swollen part got bigger to the size of a baseball Tuesday I called my doctor and they wanted me to get seen right away at the ER. They did an ultrasound  right away and they ruled out a blood clot and an abscess. They figured it would just be an infection. They put me on an antibiotic for 7 days up to 4x a day. Today 4/21 I took my last dose of the 7 days. Called my doctor and they are starting me on another 5 days of antibiotic to get rid of this infection in my arm. It is now down to a quarter size or a little bigger. Hoping that in the next 5 days it will be completely gone. I don&#39;t have the redness and heat anymore just a smallish lump.

                                                The side effects began the night following my vaccine and lasted the entire next day. It began with fatigue/brain fog, then chills and soreness at the injection site. Once the chills began I was very ill with a fever (100-101), severe aches and pains in my body from head to toe, and experienced  occasional shooting pains. Once the fever went away about 30 hours after my vaccine, I still felt pain and heaviness in my body and had a bad headache. The next day (day 3) was much better- I had no fever but still felt some brain fog, drowsiness, and slight muscle soreness (but no pain).   Two weeks after my vaccine (4/20/21)  I had a very similar experience but am not certain it was related to the vaccine. I developed chills, fatigue, and a headache for the majority of the day. In the evening, it progressed to muscle/joint pain, a severe headache, extreme fatigue, and a 100 degree fever. The next day (today 4/21), the fever has subsided and I feel slightly fatigued. Though I am not sure this was related to the vaccine, it mirrored my initial reaction to the vaccine two weeks prior. It is very unusual for me to get a fever in the 100 degree range and typically only happens every two years or so.

                                                The first 2 days had awful headache and muscle aches, could not leave the bed. Then a week later, I got a horrible rash all of my body, worse at my hands and feet. The rash included many blisters. Loss of appetite and cannot sleep. I still have the rash now, and it is even getting worse in some parts, while other parts are better due to a steroid cream prescribed by my dermatologist.  On April 26, I felt very dizzy and weak and went to urgent care. I have since recovered from those symptoms.

This happened while she was waiting the 15 minutes.   She did tell me she has Raynaud?s , however the room was very warm.  There was a nurse on site who evaluated her, checked BP, listened to lungs, HR. The nurse stayed with her and I checked on her periodically.  After about 30 minutes she felt fine and returned to work.  She did tell me she was a little skittish about getting shots  when I gave her the vaccine.

                                                So the 28th, early in the morning, I started getting a fever until 06:00 pm that day. Then I felt fine. Monday, the 29th, I had a small rash on my jaw area. It was pretty small but it kept spreading - face, ears , neck and then on to my chest, arms - it was very itchy. Thursday, I went to Immediate Care. I was prescribed prednisone. On Friday, my face was swollen to double the size. They gave me five days worth of doses which I got from the pharmacy on Friday, the 2nd.. I started April 2 with the prescription. It didn&#39;t offer immediate relief. I was still taking Benadryl in addition to prednisone. My rash still lasted for another week and a half to two weeks. I think there are still sometimes traces of it - it appears in small patches - I still get a rash on my neck. It has not fully gone away.

I continue to experience this all over my body, it is not localized to one area. This has never happened to me before, I am not allergic to anything that I am aware of, and have never had a reaction from a vaccine previously.

On left knee, bruises were located on the inside and outside of my knee. On the right knee, bruises were located on the inside of my knee. These bruises were at least 3-4 inches in diameter. News of blood clotting from J&amp;J vaccine was released on 4/13. Days after 4/11, knees and ankles started to swell. By 4/14, the swelling in my knees and ankles continued and I became fearful of blood clots that would become life-threatening. Evening of 4/14, admitted myself to the ER.

                                                During injection, felt pins and needles from injection site to fingertips which faded to tingling and stopped entirely after about 7 minutes.   Intense nausea and sweating beginning 1-2 minutes post injection; unable to sit up. Lasted approximately 7-10 minutes before clearing up  2 hours later (7:10 pm), arm at and above injection site felt hot to the touch and had mild dull pain at every movement. Slightly dizzy and nauseous. Arm periodically ached without movement.  By 7:26 pm, arm pain from movement was a sharp pain, though still pretty mild.  Around 9:30 pm, gently pressed at site of injection and a jolt of pain went all the way down to my fingers  Nausea increased at 10:13, still mild. Decided to go to sleep. Woke up at least 5 times before 12:30 am in various states of pain and discomfort, including nausea when attempting to sit up; dry throat/mouth; pins and needles throughout my glutes and thighs accompanied by pain in my left hip, knee, ankle, and jaw; and mild to moderate arm pain at the injection site. Took about 15 minutes to be able to get up due to nausea and got some water.  Was cold so wrapped myself in a blanket. Nausea and arm pain with movement remained but I was able to go back to sleep around 1:15 am.  Woke up at 2:53 am - arm pain minimal and nausea gone, blanket felt nice but unnecessary, went back to sleep  Woke up at 5:34 am with pins and needles  in glutes and thighs and pain in my right jaw, knee, hip, and ankle (all sites of previous moderate injuries) along with a low grade headache. Went back to sleep.  Woke up after an hour or so feeling relatively normal, arm pain and headache returned after sitting up. Got out of bed but ended up taking another nap.  Woke up after another hour with just a headache and brain feeling fuzzy, but strong tingles began returning to my glutes and thighs  like they had fallen asleep (referred after this point as tingles). Arm hurt. Drank some more water and took another nap.  Woke up around 9:15 am with a low grade headache and slight tingles; fuzzy brain feeling was gone. Legs wobbly when I walked. Realized that tingling got worse anytime I was sitting down or lying on my back.  Around 10:20 am started crying - no known cause. Couldn&#39;t stop for a few minutes. This is not normal for me.  Around 1 pm realized I had a pretty high fever; unsure how high it was or how long I&#39;d had it. Took another nap at 1:30 pm and woke up at 2:20 pm feeling much less hot so I thought it had broken, but I was told by my friend who dropped by that I was still feverish just much lower.  Slept from about 2:45-3:55 pm; headache was much better when I awoke; tingles and sore arm remained.  Realized at 4:13 pm that I&#39;d had no appetite the whole day. I&#39;d also barely been able to force myself to drink water; too cold and it hurt, room temperature didn&#39;t feel right.  No times, but felt periodic stabbing pain in my left ear until about 6:30 pm.  Much else also recovered by 6:30 pm: felt well enough to drink cold stuff, tingles were low grade, fever was present but low. Arm was still sore.  7:08 pm headache was gone.  8:49 pm felt much better and able to do things and take care of myself with minimal discomfort, but felt a little lousy overall - low grade headache, head felt like there was some pressure in it, periodic tingles, achy arm.  9:29 pm felt exhausted and slightly achy but otherwise mostly normal. Felt some hunger twinges for the first time that day but nothing felt appealing (realized I had only eaten about 5 spoonfuls of soup the whole day). Fell asleep getting ready for bed; woke up at 10:49 pm and finished getting ready for bed then went back to sleep.  Summary: Friday: Symptoms: mild to moderate nausea, mild dizziness, mild to moderate injection site pain, pins and needles in glutes and thighs, joint pain  Treatment: drinking water  Saturday:  Symptoms: mild to moderate pain at injection site, headache, fever, nausea, tiredness, glute and thigh tingles, lack of appetite, periodic stabbing pain in left ear  Treatments: ice/cold pack on arm (helped with arm pain while on), drinking water, sleeping

Accompanied by body aches, mild headache. Took Acetaminophen occasionally over 24 hours, but lower fever (100.8) persisted each time after medicine wore off. Limbs are sore. Slight soreness at injection site but more soreness in ankles/lower limbs. About 24 hours in, I noticed 2 faint red splotches on my stomach and chest.

                                                My shot hurt very bad, and my IMMEDIATE reaction was ?wow she shot me really high on my shoulder?. Thought that was strange, but didn?t think anything of it. Pain increased daily, and 3 weeks after my vaccine (after taking advil/tylenol daily) I was in such excruciating level 10 pain that I was losing sleep at night. I then found out about SIRVA from a friend, and after doing some reading, I was sure that?s what it was. I went to urgent care, and they knew nothing about it. They gave me muscle relaxers that didn?t do anything. I woke up a few days later with such intense throbbing/sharp pain that I was unable to move my arm/shoulder above my elbow. I went to the emergency room with a friend because I couldn?t even drive, and they also didn?t know what SIRVA was. They gave me oral steroid medication &amp; an orthopedic referral for it it got worse. The meds helped a little, brought my pain down to a 6/7. Once the meds were complete, my pain increased, so I went to the ortho, who KNEW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT, and diagnosed me with SIRVA after doing an x-ray. He told me to let him know how it was feeling a week later, since the steroids did help a bit. Unfortunately, the pain only got worse, so I went back in for a cortisone shot. That helped more than anything, and my pain is now down to a 2/3. I have been trying out some PT, but am honestly reading some crazy stories about chronic pain online that are scaring me and am afraid I will never have my arm at 100% again. The reason I am bothering with this form, is because I would love to be considered for any compensation for the nearly 3 grand in medical bills sitting on my desk. Of course on top of it, my last day at my last job was 3/31 (few days before getting vaccinated) and I just got a new job this week. These past few months have been a really really stressful time period, and I?m super angry that it?s just because I got vaccinated. Sorry for the rambling, but I really hope they raise awareness of this and alert untrained health care workers of the possibility, so that no one has to go through this again.

                                                I woke up at three AM feeling like I had a fever. I had body aches. The next morning when I woke up I felt like I had a tourniquet on my arms and legs. I was also short of breath. I went to the ER and they checked for blood clots. I started to get lower extremity cramps and muscle spasms. Two days after I started to have some shortness of breath and I was out of breath if I walked any length. One week after the vaccine I ended up wit an ear infection in my right ear. The muscle spasms continued especially in my right lower legs with twitching which lasted for five weeks. Two weeks after the shot my Asthma, which is normally controlled  got very severe. My inhalers didn&#39;t seem to work. Three weeks after the vaccine my Asthma got worse and I was having trouble breathing. I went to the ER again and there were more tests done. I was prescribed Prednisone, and I took one week off work. After multiple treatments I was prescribed antibiotics and switched my inhaler which helped. I have been trying to do some Cardio activity this weeks and I feel better after six weeks. I don&#39;t have to use my Nebulizer as much as I had been.

I took some Ibuprofens and went to sleep around 9pm and the headache was resolved around 11:30pm. However, later during the night the headache came back. Also, my body aches all over and just generally uncomfortable feelings. The injection site felt warm to the touch and sore.

                                                I noticed a very mild headache and slight coldness within 2 hours of my vaccine.  Onset of my severe symptoms began around 10PM on 03/12/2021 with a stabbing headache (Felt like someone took an air pump and kept &#39;blowing up&#39; my head. My eyes felt achy and heavy and every time I looked in a different direction I would get a zapping/electric feeling throughout my head that would cause my head and neck to spasm (longer duration) or twitch (quick jolt). This also caused dizziness). I got really cold and had intense shivering and shaking. Around midnight, my skin started feeling bruised all over my body (very sensitive to touch, including my bed sheets against my spine felt like rubbing up against a wound). At the same time, my joints (especially my neck, hips, and knees) got hot to the touch and were incredibly painful (induced tears). My muscles developed a deep ache that also caused significant pain. I felt very weak and confused. I didn&#39;t take my temperature until the early morning, and it was 102.9 at that time. I alternated taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen throughout the day, but my temperature stayed between 102 and 103.1 for about 24 hours, as did the previously noted symptoms.   I noticed a gradual improvement of my symptoms over the next two days. On the evening of 03/14/2021, my headache worsened some, and I had an unexpected episode where I nearly passed out (dropped to the floor but stayed conscious). I also had intermittent foot tingling (very noticeable, not mild) over the course of a few hours.   For 3 full days (but by far the most severe within the first 24 hours), I experienced some strange sound processing. Things like the sound of a car driving by or the ceiling fan felt like it echoed throughout my whole body and gave me an uncomfortable shivering feeling.   As of today (03/16/2021), I am mostly recovered. I am still experiencing fatigue, a very mild headache, and some mild pain. My nausea has completely resolved, though that was never a chief complaint of mine.   I realize that some of my symptoms are to be expected with this vaccine. But especially the level of pain I experienced throughout my entire body was very concerning and not something that I was aware could happen as a result of the vaccine.

                                                About five hours after the vaccine injection, at around 11 PM, I began to feel cold and achy, which soon led to body chills all over. It felt like I could not get warm no matter how many extra blankets I added. This soon led to a fever. I was in an out of sleep for the next few hours and woke up around 2:30 AM. At that point the fever had broken and I was sweating. I still had body aches, which I think was due to my body being tensed up for some many hours, and I had a splitting headache, as well. At around 4:30 AM, I woke up again, with a very sore arm a terrible headache still. I got up and took 400 mg of Ibuprofen and went back to sleep. At 7 AM my alarm went off and all adverse effects seemed to be gone other than a sore arm. The sore arm last for about 6 days.

                                                Injection technique seemed poor as it was the most painful vaccination I&#39;ve ever received, and upper arm became tight and achy immediately. Soreness lingered but the sharper pain went away shortly after. About 8-10 hours later I began feeling nauseous and lightheaded. 12 hours after vaccine I had trouble falling asleep, overcome with nausea and chills.  This turns into sweating and insomnia the rest of the night. The following day I felt better, but the next night (and following one) I continued feeling a bit sick. Currently (3 days later) my upper arm is still very sore and I have lots of muscle/joint aches throughout my whole body.

I didn&#39;t take anything for awhile for it. Thursday morning, on the first, my arm - at the injection site - was swollen to size of nickel. Over the next few days it grew to a size of a paper dollar bill - red, hot and swollen and very itchy. Saturday - 4/3/2021 - I went to a pharmacy where I get my meds and the pharmacist suggested I take anti-inflammatories and Benadryl. I did put ice pack on before taking those. I do still have a lump on my arm at the injection site - it&#39;s probably the size of a quarter now.

                                                Starting on 4/8/21 around 9:00 PM my body started to feel slightly sore and I had a low grade temperature of 99.6. Throughout the night my body became extremely sensitive and sore especially in my lower back and neck. My temperature also continued to rise to 103.0.  Throughout the day of 4/9/21 I was taking Tylenol and ibuprofen on a rotating schedule. My temperature went up and down throughout the day spiking at 105.7 and dropping down to 101.2. Around 10:00 PM it was around 102.9 and my body was becoming even weaker. This morning, now 36 hours after my symptoms started, I can barely lift my arm, my headache has worsened, my total soreness and weakness is no better and my temperature is 102.3.  I have also had trouble with staying hydrated because my skin hurts if it is not covered from the air and I get heavy chills,  but when I cover up I am profusely sweating constantly. The sweat is so bad, I constantly have to lay on a towel and change my clothes.

                                                Was administered covid vaccine J&amp;J  on left arm felt a burning sensation just after it which i knew it normal you just got a vaccine. Walked to the observatory area where we are supposed to wait 15min until you are released to go. Well less than 10 min in the observation area that?s when i started to feel un well my body started sweating excessively and thats when i felt numbness on my right side of my head with a tingling sensation couldn?t hear with my right ear and i freaked out when i started to get blurred vision thats when i knew something was wrong i got up to ask for water once i got up i felt like i was going to faint and felt really dizzy. Once i got to the lady that was there in the observation area  she was shocked at how i looked she told me to go sit down and brought me water as she called the ambulance. Once i was sitting down and was brought water i drank like more than half of the water and the numbness was going down from my right side of my head but still had blurred vision and just felt disoriented and not my self. The ambulance took me to the ER once i got there i felt a little better but still disoriented and dizzy. So disoriented that i left the hospital with me actually realizing i had to stay there to get checked because they kept saying i was fine.

                                                In the evening while making dinner I noticed mild pain at injection site and began to notice increasing chills, and unusually intense tiredness, which were followed that night by a low grade fever, headache, and nausea which led to vomiting.  Was unable to sleep that night and unable to eat most of the following day due to these symptoms, primarily the nausea. Symptoms began to resolve during the later afternoon of April 11th. No medical treatment sought as these were side effects listed on the fact sheet and expected to go away which they did. Still experiencing mild arm pain in injection arm but expecting that to resolve soon on its own.

These symptoms started about 6 hours post-vaccine and lastest for about 36 hours on and off.    Arm at injection site is still sore to the touch, but manageable.   Around 3 PM on Sunday, April 11th a small rash/hives broke out on the inside of my left arm opposite of my elbow. My vaccine was given in the right arm, but the right arm did not have any reaction. This rash lasted for about 12-24 hours and then was gone. It was never itchy.

                                                I had sparkles in my vision 5 min. after getting my shot. They went away quickly, so I wasn&#39;t concerned. I had a little bit of hotness up my neck and a little itchy, but both also were quick to go away. I went home and went to bed without issue. I woke up at 4am crying and in a lot of pain all over my body. I had a crushing headache, my back, arms and legs ached down to the bone. I had a fever of 100.7, and had to call in sick from work. I took 3 ibuprofen and it didn&#39;t help stop the pain or fever. I cried myself back to sleep after wreathing in pain for 3 hours. Woke up again crying again and the pain and fever continued on. I drank 2 beers to see if that would help relax my muscles and back around 3pm and by 4pm I finally felt somewhat better, but still couldn&#39;t get up out of bed. I had to call my brother over to help me and considered asking him to take me to the hospital several times because the pain was so intense. The spot where I got my shot wasn&#39;t inflamed, or if it was I didn&#39;t notice. It did seem a little stiff. I managed to fall back asleep and by the time I woke up again the next day around 5am, I felt completely fine. Fever disappeared and the body pain was gone. It was like nothing had ever happened.

As of 4/15 hard lump remains at injection site. 4/6- 12:15pm hives, redness, itching, burning on sides of upper thighs, buttocks, within 2 hours hives spread to backs of arms, all the way down legs. Went to quick care facility at 2:30pm. Waited in waiting room until 3:50pm checked legs with doctor at 4:00pm and little red dots appeared in random clusters down both legs. Doctor assumed folliculitis, prescribed Cephalexin. 5:00pm took 50mg Benadryl while waiting for prescription. Picked up antibiotic around 6:30pm. When I got home around 7:00pm both legs were burning. Discovered huge painful red patches all over both legs. 10:00pm took 50mg Benadryl again. Went to bed 4/7- 9:00am red patches still painful, burning. Took 50mg more Benadryl. Spent most of the day sleeping 4/8- hives gone due to benadryl. Red patches slightly less painful. New red patches/dots appeared on ankles and tops of feet 4/9- red dots spread over tops of feet/toes, new itchy bumps with red dots appeared trailing down the backs of calf area on both legs. 8:30am went back to quick care facility. Saw new doctor who instructed to stop taking antibiotic and switch to cream form of &#34;triamcinolone 0.1%&#34; twice daily. Also referred to dermatology specialist. 3:30pm first application of steroid cream made legs burn and feet/ankles swell. Determined too much was used 4/10-4/13 smaller amount of cream applied twice daily as directed. Burning stopped but feet/ankles still swollen each day 4/13-original large red patches mostly cleared. New red dots on backs of calves and tops of feet still prevalent. 4:00pm saw dermatology specialist who determined red dots were a form of vasculitis. Ordered blood and urine analysis to determine if other organs have been affected.

                                                On 03/18/2021 at 03:30AM I had a lot of arm pain from my shoulder to my elbow in my left arm. This lasted until 03/31/2021.  On 03/18/2021 I woke up with a headache that would not go away. Next, at about 03:15PM I was not able to walk for about 10 minutes. Then, at about 05:00PM I started menstruating. At 07:00PM I had severe pain in my pelvic area for an hour and a half. At approximately 08:30PM I passed a softball sized blood clot vaginally.  I bled heavily through the night.  On 03/19/2021 I still had a headache and no energy at all. I continued to bleed heavily all day as well. 03/20/2021 was the exact same as the days prior. 03/21/2021 I was still bleeding heavily throughout the day with no energy. I still had the headache as well. I started feeling dizzy while walking on this day.  03/22/2021 I went to work like normal. I was cold all day. I was still bleeding, headache and dizziness. It was hard to stand for 30 minutes. While climbing the stairs I got very light headed and dizzy. I could not go up the stairs at a normal pace. 03/23/2021 I had the same symptoms all day but I was getting short of breath walking short distances. I still had very little energy and a headache. I also lost all color in my face and hands. I was still cold all day. I noticed some slight swelling in my ankles.  03/24/2021 The symptoms were getting more intense. I was still cold.  I finally took some aspirin for the headache because it was very severe. The medication didn&#39;t help with it. This routine went on for the next week and the symptoms intensified with each day. Throughout this time I was still passing clots that ranged in size from golf/ping pong ball to baseballs. They were very painful when they passed.  The days from 03/25/2021 to 04/01/2021 were all the same as far as how I felt.  On 04/02/2021 I woke up with the same symptoms but now I could not stay awake for anything. I slept on and off all day. I only ate one meal a day because I was so tired and I had no appetite. The headache was getting worse as the days went on. The bleeding was still happening. It was not as heavy as the weeks before, but enough to be painful still. I also started having abdominal pain.  On 04/03/2021 I was seeing stars when I moved too quickly. My heart rate was elevated with shortness of breath along with the rest of the previous symptoms. My headache however was very intense.  04/04/2021 I still couldn&#39;t stay awake on top of all the other symptoms. The dizziness and stars were more frequent. I couldn&#39;t move my head without seeing stars.  04/05/2021 I couldn&#39;t get warm and I still felt the same way. I called and made a doctor?s appointment for Wednesday the 7th. I had all the same symptoms still and they were getting worse. I had to move in slow motion so I could try to function.  04/06/2021 I woke up drained of all my energy and color. I couldn&#39;t shower because of the pain in my body. I couldn&#39;t stand because I felt like I was going to fall down. I could barely stand up straight let alone walk very far. I was shaking from being so cold. I had all the same symptoms from the days prior. I was in severe pain. I couldn&#39;t sit because of the pain in my abdomen I couldn&#39;t stand because of the weakness in my legs. I could barely see anything because of the stars I was seeing. At this point I had no color and I was barely conscious. That is when my family took me to the emergency room.

                                                On the 13th, I had a low grade fever and it never actually broke past 100. I spent most of the day in bed. Fatigued - and general was exhausted and tired .After that day, everything was pretty good. I had minor discomfort in my arm (that first day.) On the Friday, the 16th- my left arm - a third of my upper arm was bright red, swollen and hot to the touch and it was very painful. I reached out to a doctor for a chat with a doctor. The dr had me take 600 mg of Motrin and a Claritin and I took those based on the dosages allowed on the box, consistently for about 24 hours and after that it started getting a lot better.  I&#39;d say by Sunday the 18th, I was pretty much back to normal and everything resolved.  Doctor chat but not a regular doctor visit.

                                                Broke out in hives once a week since 04/09/21 that varies: around my stomach,  on both sides of my torso from armpit to waist, inner thighs, around the clavicles, and/or below my knees. Worsens at night.  Since  04/23/21, it happened almost everyday and it comes and goes. As of now, on 04/30/21, it hasn&#39;t appeared.   I take generic Benadryl around the evening time, but it doesn&#39;t really help.

Thursday evening, 8th, I got hives - all over my body and that started on my left arm and then it didn&#39;t go in my mouth but otherwise all over. I went to my doctor  - the ER at my doctor&#39;s site - on Saturday, 10th. He prescribed me some medicine - don&#39;t remember what plus I took Benadryl . I had to take a week and a half off of work because the medication was so strong.  My hives lasted another week. It stopped growing after that week and then it started healing.

                                                I started to feel a little intoxicated 20 minutes after the vaccine. After  about 30 minutes I had rashes on my face. I was unable to walk in a straight line.  I was also very emotional.  I took a nap and woke up with a headache, chills and sweating, I had body aches and pain in my back. My skin was hot to the touch.  I was nauseous and weak with no fever. The next day I was having shortness of breath and I thought I had blood clots.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine, my left arm and left side of my neck and back became very sore and I felt very light headed and dizzy. 7 hours later, the back pain worsened and I started sweating a lot. Soon after my skin all over my body began to tingle as if I had bugs crawling all over my body and it was very uncomfortable. During the night I couldn&#39;t sleep because I was sweating so much, the back pain was getting worse and worse, and the tingly skin feeling turned into very intense skin sensitivity and hurt any time my body touched something or rubbed against my clothing. At some points I would be extremely hot and sweating a lot and then some points I was freezing cold and shaking uncontrollably. These signs all lasted 24 hours and slowly started going away after 48 hours. After 48 hours, I felt much better and back to &#34;normal&#34; but couldn&#39;t help but notice some strange reactions that I still have today, 3 weeks later... I have had acne which is uncommon for me. I have had period cramps and mood swings but am not on my period. I also have had crazy bloating in my stomach and all over my body... swollen legs, feet, hands, etc. I also have been experiencing brain fog where I loose my train of thought in conversation, I can&#39;t remember where I put things, I can&#39;t remember if I took my eye contacts out or not, or fed the dog... very strange and uncharacteristic of me to be so aloof and forgetful but to the point where I have zero recollection of doing such activities.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Injection site on arm hurt immediately after injection and upper arm is still sore today (3 days later). Approx 7 hours after receiving vaccine I experienced a sudden onset of overall body aches and joint pain specifically in my knees. It was kind of severe- even my skin was hurting when I got goosebumps. A fever came on after that and I was shivering, cold, sweaty. Approx 11 hours after injection I began to experience a severe headache and sleepiness. Symptoms continued overnight and disturbed my sleep, but were relieved somewhat by taking ibuprofen. By the next morning (after sleeping 14 hours) I was only feeling tired, arm soreness, and headache (no more fever, chills, body aches). All symptoms except arm soreness cleared up rather suddenly, approx 24 hours after they came on (which was approx 31 hours after injection).

                                                I had some slight arm pain the day of the shot, but the morning after my arm that received the injection was in so much pain that I could barely even move it. Very little mobility, slight bruising and a red circle around the injection site about 1.5 inches. However, I felt fine most of the entire day besides that. Around hour 28 of getting vaccinated I started to get very bad chills that lasted for about 3 hours. Took my temperature, which stayed around 100 degrees the entire night, 100.5 at its highest point that I checked. The next day it was standing in around 99.9. Felt slight muscle soreness the last couple days, but no fever since then. My arm gained a little mobility on Sunday, 2 days since vaccination so I thought it was getting better. but Monday and today (Tuesday) my knot/lump in my arm at the vaccination site is back to hurting extremely bad and the swelling and size of the lump and red circle is actually growing and pain is starting to increase again.  The red circle is around 4.5 inches now and the pain is sharper where the injection happened.  I am starting to get worried something is wrong, but will give it another day or so before checking in with a doctor.

                                                Approximately 48 hours after receiving the vaccine, i developed what may  be described as &#34;Covid Arm&#34;: A warm, red large circle surrounding the injection site that was tender to the touch and itchy at times. Additionally, I developed a hard mass under the skin at the injection site. The redness and itchiness lasted about a week. The redness increased with touch and after showers. The itchiness slighlt subsided with topical cortisone. The pain/tenderness surrounding the hard mass lasted about 12 days. I&#39;m currently 13 days out from receipt of vaccination and continue to have the hard mass under the injection site.

I had a bad headache, fever, chills, muscle aches, and nausea. I couldn&#39;t hold down water of food. At 10am the following day (3/21) I was able to take aTylenol and the fever came down. So far, I have taken Tylenol throughout the day and kept the fever down, however I still get bad night sweats and muscle aches. Today (3/23) I feel a little off, but much better.

I had blankets piled on me, an ice pack on my head, and two ibuprofen.   The fever broke over night and the headache reduced over night as well. The oter symptoms became less severe over the course of the 28th and are only remnant on the 29th. The arm pain and swelling are still present and I have muscle tension and pain pulsing up the left upper back/ neck area.

No swelling or redness but my arm hurts to touch or move. Beginning this morning (4/1/21) around 7:30 am I started having a headache.  I took an ibuprofen which slightly lessened the pain but it has not gone away all day.  It worsens with activity. Starting around 8:30-9:00 am I started to feel nauseous and lightheaded.  I didn&#39;t take any medication for these symptoms.  They&#39;ve stuck with me all day. Starting around 11:30am I started to feel cold chills and body/muscle aches.  This has continued throughout the day. Starting around 2:45 pm I&#39;ve felt feverish, with severe cold chills.

                                                About an hour after injection (~9:15am), I felt mild fatigue and a very mild headache. The fatigue progressed throughout the day and made me very exhausted. About 8 hours after the injection, I had chills, still fatigued, mild headache, and about an hour later I ran a low grade fever (about 99*).  Took Tylenol to keep my fever down. Temp shot back up to 101* a few hours later (still having body aches, fatigue and chills, and some mild nausea at this point.) My fever broke about 19 hours after the injection. 24 hours after the injection, the injection site was sore and I had a moderate headache with mild nausea. This continued throughout the day so I rested. 48 hours after the injection, still soreness in my upper left arm from the injection with mild headache, mild nausea and small lack of appetite. 72 hours after injection, completely back to normal with some soreness in my upper left arm at injection site.

About 5 minutes in, I started to become dizzy, my vision started blacking out, my hearing was muffled, I became clammy, sweaty, and experienced mental disorientation. It became harder for me to breathe, but I never struggled to take a breath. I drank some water and waited for the symptoms to subside. I remained seated and these symptoms went away within 5 minutes. After feeling better for about 5 minutes, I felt cold and was shivering. The woman sitting next to me was completely fine after her shot. I&#39;ve since felt a slight burning sensation on my skin in areas that I have scratched lightly. I&#39;m also experiencing strange feelings throughout my body- specifically my head, leg, and hand. It feels like I can feel something in each area for a bit and then it subsides after several minutes.

It was like an asthma attack, but normally my asthma attacks are caused by a sinus infection. This was just shortness of breath and gasping for air.  I used my rescue inhaler with increasing frequency over the course of the following week. By March 12, I had to use my nebulizer. I used the nebulizer once on March 12, twice on March 13, twice on March 14, and I finally went to urgent care on March 15 when the nebulizer stopped helping. Urgent care was unable to help due to covid protocols, so they put me on oxygen for 5 minutes and transferred me to the ER.  At the ER, by the time I got to the ER, my breathing had normalized. I was given prednisone on site, as well as a prescription for 5 days. I had a chest xray done that returned completely normal.

                                                I received the vaccine on 4/8/2021 around 8:35am. I felt fine all day, only soreness at injection site. Later that day (around 6:00pm) I started feeling lightheaded, chills and a headache. My hands, feet, nose and hands were freezing but other areas of my body were warm. I also felt body aches- my lower back started with the aches and it spread up to my upper neck. Around 9:00pm I started feeling very hot and this hot/cold changes continued throughout the night. This morning of 4/9/2021 I have less of a headache however, my body is still very sore and I continue to experience the hot/cold changes.

Headache and nausea about four hours after shot. Fever of 102.6 about 7 hours after shot accompanied by chills/shaking worse than any fever I?ve had. Tylenol was taken around time of headache which may have delayed the fever and chills. Tylenol and ibuprofen were taken simultaneously every 5 hours starting that evening and throughout the night and all the next day. Food consumption was minimal due to nausea but hydration  was maintained.

                                                I had the Janssen covid shot yesterday. The shot stung a little and made my arm sore. Later on in the evening I became tired (so far nothing I didn&#39;t assume would happen) so I took a nap. When I woke up, my arm stung worse than when I had the shot and the pain kept shooting up my shoulder into my neck. I went back to sleep, thinking it was just normal vaccine stuff. When I woke up this morning, I had chills, a fever of 101.7, and muscle aches. My body feels like I have a sunburn all over it. My right arm feels like it was stung by a scorpion. I feel dizzy and nauseous, and I have head fog. I feel the exact same way I did when I had COVID19, but with my arm hurting so bad, anything that barely touches it (such as clothes) shoots a stinging pain up my neck

                                                I experienced a low-grade fever (100), muscle and joint pain, pain at the injection site, and fatigue during the first 24 hours after receiving the vaccine. A little less than 24 hours after the vaccine, my fever broke, and I began to develop a rash on my legs, which consisted of small, itchy, bug-bite like red bumps. I consulted my primary care physician, who recommended I take Benadryl. The rash worsened and spread to my torso - stomach, chest, underarms, and forearms - but was never present at the injection site. The rash on my chest was significantly different than the rest of my body, and when I saw an urgent care provider (5 days after being vaccinated), she diagnosed the chest rash as a separate issue (Folliculitis) and prescribed oral antibiotics. I saw no improvement in any symptoms. A week after being vaccinated and symptoms not improving, I saw my Allergist, who prescribed a 10-day course of oral steroids (Prednisone). My symptoms gradually improved, but the rash did not fully disappear for approximately 3 weeks after the first symptoms appeared.

The site of injection has been sore to the touch ever since I got the shot as well.

                                                Om March 26th I recieved the vaccine and then had a fever later that night. I recovered from the fever. On April 1st I was exposed to someone who had Covid 19 and contracted it myself. I became symptomatic with congestion, cough, fatigue which all last until the 9th of April. On April 12th a rash began to breakout on my skin and I began to experience nausea. Today, April 13th, the nausea has worsen and the rash spread to my whole body. I am unsure of whether it is related to Covid or the vaccine.

                                                On Sunday, 4/11  my eyelids were tingling, it then went to my forehead, entire face and both of my arms. My muscles stiffened and my hands/thumbs were cramping inward. My hands were also red and blotchy during this time. My face was tight and hard to move or talk. This entire incident lasted in total around 20 minutes or so. I seem to be okay since that incident, I have had a headache off and on. Not sure if it?s related to the vaccine but I haven?t experienced anything like this before.

I started feeling nauseous about an hour later. Then at about 9:00 pm, I started to feel really sick. I felt very tired and my whole body hurt. I had a low body temperature, 95 degrees. Chills, fever, shaking, nausea. Very SEVERE symptoms. Felt very disoriented. I thought I was going to pass out and faint. Vision blurry and seen white.  Pounding headache. Ears ringing. I could hardly walk that night, I was crawling on the floor. I felt out of breath. My heart was beating very fast. My left side of my chest hurt by my ribs. When I did wake up from sleep, I woke up with blood in my mouth and dried blood on my lips.

Redness is gone, and slight pain remains when touched.

                                                I was tired the night of the shot and my arm was painful near the injection site, hard to move arm and touch caused great pain. My neck also started to lock up from my shoulder across to my spine and up my neck. This lasted about three days with occasional tension in the neck area coming back. Next morning I was very achy and my entire body felt like my muscles had a buildup of lactic acid. I did not have a fever but felt feverish that night. I felt the fever broke Saturday night/early Sunday morning (4/4) while I was asleep. I developed a slight cough for a few days and the muscle aches decreased by half each day. I felt mostly better after a week but occasionally felt tired and the cough lasted about a week. My arm developed a bolus at the injection site in the muscle that took about two weeks to go away, with occasional ice. The arm pain only lasted about 4 days before full range of motion was restored.

                                                I received the shot on Saturday, March 6th. Flu-like symptoms developed 12 hours after (aches, chills, extreme fatigue) and lasted about 12 hours -- pain in left arm lasted a full five days. On Thursday March 11th I started to develop a cold sore on my chin which was followed by malaise and swollen glands. I treated it with Zovirax. On Wednesday March 17th I developed what looked to be a pimple in the middle of my left eyelid. There was a small white/ fluid filled head about the size of a pin head. Over the next three days, three more fluid-like blisters the size of a pin-head began to develop on upper eyelid. By Tuesday March 23rd, I had over half a dozen fluid filled blisters that were painful and began to crust. The blisters extended from upper eyelid to below the brow (only on left side of face). On Tuesday March 23rd I went to the eye doctor. The eye doctor had asked if I ever had shingles (I have had the chicken pox vaccine, but never had chicken pox nor shingles). I have had HSV-1 since childhood and get the yearly cold-sore when stressed or immunity is low, but I never have had cold sores appear anywhere else other than lip/chin area. The doctor had suspected the eye blisters were a form of herpes and prescribed me 14 days of Valacyclovir. The blisters only affected the skin-- not the cornea or inside eye. Within a day and a half of the antivirals medication, the blisters were fully crusted over and started to clear up.

                                                I have severe, random, and unprovoked bruising covering both legs. I have abdominal pain that has persistent since being vaccinated. I?m dizzy. I?m bleeding in my urine, stool, and vaginally. Period came early (unrelated to previous vaginal bleeding) and is not clotting. Just significant amounts of red blood, soaking through one ultra absorbency tampon an hour. I have a headache. Went to the ER and my platelets were (345) and my blood sugar low. My bp was 145/90 which is high for me, from the bleeding.  They said I have a ?higher chance of being bitten by a shark? than having a side effect. They diagnosed me with a single contusion and sent me home. Have been feeling worse since leaving the hospital.

It?s gotten much better, but I still have a very small lump there. I was seen on April 19th for constant pounding in my left ear that started around April 12th. I was told I had pulsatile tinnitus, and I will be having a MRA scan on May 8th. I have felt some pressure in my head since then, and was told it may be related, but to just wait for the scan.

Treatment: During the time it was spreading, I made an online doctor?s appointment to get it checked out.

Outcome: Claritin turned out to be enough, rash went completely away within 2-3 hours of taking it. Steroids were not needed.

                                                Developed hives on arms, legs, and feet within 24 hours. Was able to suppress hives for the first week and a half with Benadryl. Switched to Zyrtec and Pepcid with some break through hives. It has been 7 weeks since the vaccine and hives continue. Sometimes they will be mild or completely suppressed by the medicine. Other weeks there will be bad outbreaks despite continued medication (40 mg Zyrtec, 40 mg Pepcid as prescribed by the doctor and occasionally an additional Benadryl). This includes hives covering feet, legs, butt, back, chest, arms, and hands. Sometimes the hives are small and distinct and other times they merge together to large red swollen areas. Hives are red and swollen often surrounded by a thin white area. Sometimes they are not at all itchy and other times they are highly itchy.

                                                I developed a rash under my right breast and on my right back. It was itchy and I went to the doctor (on a regular OB appt) and they diagnosed as shingles. And I was prescribed Valtrex for two weeks. I took it the full course and the rash went away.  I still had the rash when baby was born but it went away after that. While I was in the hospital for delivery, a few different people came and looked at the rash with a concern it might be contagious to my new daughter.   Pregnancy - first pregnancy; due date was May 9 and I delivered on May 3.  Birth weight of baby - 8 lbs and 13 ounces.

Asthma attack happened one time, during the coughing phase.  High blood pressure started the evening of the vaccine and has continued. Doctor has prescribed a low dose of blood pressure medication to help combat it. Fever and chills started on the first day and lasted through the second day.

                                                Same day on the vaccine I noticed swelling on the vaccine site. Two days later I started feeling my throat swollen I had my lymph node swollen on my neck &amp; under the jaw line everything was on the left side as the vaccine. It started to become very painful 6 days later I went to the urgent care and they gave me antibiotics to treat it. It was a 2 week treatment once I finished it about 5 days later I had to go again because it started to happen again I went in to get more. Now a couple a weeks ago its starting again but I have not gone to the urgent care anymore I&#39;m just watching it and hoping it goes away. If it does get worst then I will be going again.

                                                At the time of injection, it was pretty painful and thus sent my body into a shock less than 5 mins after receiving my dose. My vision went white and I was very light-headed and hot/sweaty.  A nurse came with me outside to monitor and I was feeling back to normal in 15 minutes. This is something that happens when I experience a high amount of pain, so just reporting for others who maybe have low blood pressure issues.  At about 8pm, other side effects started to set in. I first experienced a headache, then experienced soreness/ache-y-ness  in my back. Around 8:30, I started to feel light headed again and soon my whole body felt ache-y. I quickly developed chills where I felt so cold that I was uncontrollably shaking and felt very sore/stiff. I have been laying under a heated blanket for the last hour and a half and am finally feeling better with no more shaking  or chills. I still have soreness throughout my body and a headache, but I took ibuprofen around 8:30pm.

                                                Around 3:15 in the afternoon, I began experiencing severe aches and muscle pains, combined with a growing migraine. Not realizing what it may be related to, I took two ibuprofen and I&#39;ve acetaminophen.  By the time I around home around 6:30, I could barely hold myself up. I ate dinner, which only helped minimally, and by 8 pm felt like death. My husband notice I looked red and felt my forehead, immediately going for the thermometer. I had a fever of 100.5.  We eventually got me into bed after downing a lot of water, but the pain would not ease up. The pain was too excruciating. At 10:30 my husband came to bed and we took my temp again which was 101.6. To help me sleep I took another Tylenol. At 5:45 my work alarm went off and I checked my temp again; still 101.6. I got a cold pack for my migraine and went back to sleep. Slowly throughout the day my fever dwindled, until it finally broke in the early afternoon. By 4:15, as I am writing this, all that&#39;s left is done tiredness, thirst, and a small bit of achiness.

                                                Vasovagal syncope a few minutes after vaccination.   Fever of 101.8F 24h after vaccination (3/10/2021). Fever is continuing today (3/11/2021), but is lower at 100.4F. Tingling fingers on hand from vaccination arm (left), swelling from vaccination injection site, headache, and neck pain all developed on 3/10/2021.  Headache and neck pain could be due to head trauma from vasovagal syncope. Tingling fingers were not observed on 3/11/2021.    *I have had vasovagal syncope in the past, but never with vaccines. It always occurs when I see my own blood.

I took two pills of extra strength Tylenol and water and laid back down to break the fever and help with the aches and pains. I woke up around 9:30am on 3/13/21 and did not have and appetite all day. I was extremely fatigued all day and had no energy to get out of bed or do much.  On 3/14/21 I began to develop an appetite again around noon. I was still fatigued. My arm was very tender and itchy at the injection site and hurt to the touch. My 5:00pm on 3/14/21 I had more energy and the aches were gone but my arm was still hurting and sore.

                                                I started feeling subtle flu-like symptoms about 6 hours after receiving shot. At first I thought it was in my head but by the early evening I felt like I had a full blown fever even though I never actually had a fever at any point.  I had chills, muscles aches, head aches, and extreme fatigue. My back hurt especially and overall I felt very weak. I also had pain at the injection site that got worse the following day. I had trouble even lifting my arm to reach a drink just a few feet away from me.  The arm soreness lasted through the Monday following my vaccination (I received it on a Friday). All my symptoms were at their worst on Saturday. I felt much better on Sunday but still had the arm pain through Monday. Motrin did help relieve the worst my symptoms. I thought that was the end of my symptoms but that last week I have noticed what I believe to be a lingering fatigue from the vaccination. While it&#39;s not usual for me to feel tired at points throughout the day, I have been feeling a heavier and more full body fatigue than I usually experience. I have had to take naps more often, sometimes multiple times in a day.  During these bouts of fatigue, my whole body feels heavy and somewhat weak. It&#39;s similar to the exhausted feeling someone might have after they&#39;ve been crying for a while but I haven&#39;t been crying or emotionally taxed in anyway.  Normally when I wake up in the morning, I might feel tired for the first 30 minutes to an hour but once I get moving, I feel better and more alter. I have been having a harder time feeling rested or awake in the mornings and even if I get more sleep than normal, I still feel exhausted. I did not change my routine or diet which I why I think this is related to the vaccine.

The day after I recieved the covid vaccine Janssen, I started noticing the injection site getting red and swollen. By the next day it had grown in size and was itching rather badly. I could sleep from how badly it was itching and burning. It has been 6 days since I got the vaccine and it&#39;s still large and swollen and really itchy. I have been taking ibuprofen for the pain and using benadryl for the itching.

After taking some Advil my lips returned to normal and the body shakes stopped although it was hard to regulate my body temperature. I was sweating but felt cold. The worst of the symptoms seemed to last around 13 hours after they had started (so about 7pm on 3/25 to about 8am on 3/26). It&#39;s now been around 30 hours and I&#39;m feeling better but still fatigued and have soreness in my left arm where I received the injection.

                                                I received the vaccine at 1:30 pm in the afternoon on 3/22/21 and immediately afterwards I felt fine. I waited my 15 minutes and had no signs of a reaction and was free to go. Later in the afternoon, around 3:15 pm, I began to feel a little fatigued and my arm was sore. Around 6:00 pm that same night, I developed a low grade temp of 99.8, I was very fatigued, had achiness all over, as well as my arm was very warm and tender.  I was unable to sleep through the night of 3/22/21 into 3/23/21 and got out of bed around 4: 30 am on 3/23/21 and had to call into work due to the pain. The pain was not an achiness but sharp throughout my whole body. Around 9:00 am, I took a pain reliever and was able to sleep for a few hours. Upon waking up around 1:30-2:00 pm, I was still hurting and was then nauseated as well. I tried to drink water and ate a few crackers to settle my stomach with no relief. At 5:15 pm on 3/23/21, I went to the bathroom and got in the shower to try to help with the pain. After a few minutes in the shower, I became extremely lightheaded and felt like I was going to be sick. I sat down in the bathtub and hollered for my mother to come help me because at this point, I felt like I needed to go to the hospital. Upon sitting down in the bathtub, I began to profusely vomit and started to lose feeling in my legs. My mother entered the bathroom and I explained what was happening and soon after my hands contracted and were stuck in an abnormal position. The pain was unbearable and I was unable to move them from that position. I was unable to get myself out of the bathtub so my mom then called for an ambulance. These symptoms occurred somewhere around 5:20-5:21 pm and EMS was called at 5:22 pm. After a few minutes, I was able to regain movement of my legs but my hands and fingers were still contracted and unmovable. I was able to help my mother enough to put my clothes on and to make my way outside to the front porch to get fresh air. After getting outside, I was accompanied by my mother and my neighbor whom is a nurse. My neighbor looked at my hands and noticed they were discolored and she attempted to straighten out my fingers to no avail. The pain in my fingers was sharp and excruciating but there was also a pins and needle type pain as well. I remained outside until EMS arrived. I was then transported to Hospital where I was seen in the ER for this. Upon arrival to the ER, the physician ordered labs and fluids and stated that apparently he had seen at least 2 other cases that day with a similar reaction to the vaccine. He explained that I was having an adverse reaction to the vaccine and that my hands should return to normal within 24-48 hours. I was then discharged home. As of 3/24/21, I was able to straighten my left hand out and my right hand, my fingers would straighten out, but they would return to a curled resting position. As of 3/25/21, I returned to work and I have some weakness in both hands with a slight discoloration of each hand as well. I am a nurse and work in an office and the physicians in my office commented on the color of skin upon seeing them. I was still very achy and fatigued. My arm was still sore and tender as well. As of today, 3/26/21, I am still achy as well as tired. My right hand has improved some but still returns to a curled resting position. The color of my hands has improved as well. I am a nurse and have seen many things throughout my career. This experience has been absolutely terrifying and I still have no answers as to why this happened to my body. I did my part by being vaccinated and was terrified that I was going to lose my life to it. I pray this does not happen to anyone else.

                                                On Monday 3/15 or Tuesday 3/16 I started developing a rash on the knuckles of my right hand and fingers. It first looked like small burns, and then started swelling to look more like spider bites. The rash spread over the course of the next two weeks, and also showed up on my left hand. Eventually, the one on my right hand looked like a blood blister. The rashes itched at first, and then started hurting to the touch. They were especially sensitive to sunlight. Now, as of 3/30, they seem to be clearing up.

I already imagined that the fever was starting. 3 hours later I got home and took my temperature, it was 101 F.   the fever lasted more than 15 hours. I didn?t  take any medication. I put cold cloths on my head, bathed and rested. the headache was very intense. So far I have discomfort from that but the fever has already stopped. The most striking thing was the allergic reaction that I began to have around midnight and it continued until today. they were hives all over the body. swelling and itching and redness. Finally after 24hs after vaccine I took an anti allergy called levocetirizine  cause itching won?t stop.

The dizziness subsided close to 1 pm. At approximately 4 pm I was lethargic, and starting to run a fever with arm pain at the injection site. By 7pm I had no energy, small cough, fever (unknown), chills, and headache. This lasted until 10 AM the next day. Headache lasted until 5 pm the next day.

Fever of 100.4. Had a headache and was shaky all night. The next two days I have been fatigued.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Day after vaccination I had a slight fever and severe fatigue. I was only able to stay awake for an hour at a time. I also had a severe headache and pain and swelling at the injection site. The next day, the fever broke (about halfway through the day) and my fatigue lightened. I was still experiencing a minor headache and continued pain and swelling at the injection site. The third day, I woke up feeling normal, until I engaged in physical activity. The fatigue returned, however I am no longer experiencing a headache and the pain in my arm has lessened considerably. The swelling hasn?t reduced.

Once I was done freezing and with the fever it felt like my skin was on fire. I was in so much pain that night that I couldn&#39;t move without crying. After I slept that night and about 7 hours the next day I finally started to feel better.

                                                I had immediate soreness after the vaccine does. Then at 7pm of the evening after getting my vaccine, I began to feel weak, get chills, and run a low grade fever. At midnight, my fever had increased to 101 and I began taking Tylenol (recommended by Pharmacy). I had sever body aches, muscle fatigue, joint paint, chills and nausea through the night and the next day. In the morning, I had excruciating pain in my abdomen and began vomitting. Later that  day, my fever increased to 102.7 (with Tylenol) and I called my regular doctor. She told me to continue to monitor and if my fever did not decrease by 7pm to go the hospital. Finally, my fever decreased to 101, muscle aches, chills and joint pain continued. I began vomitting uncontrollably for a short period of time. I was very dizzy and weak the remainder of the day. Saturday, my fever finally broke (I sweated all day) but my body was still weak and sore. I also had dizzy spells on and off. Sunday, I felt much better but was still very tired compared to my normal self. I had abdomen pain and burning on and off. I also got hive on my hands Sunday afternoon. After Benadryl, the hives went away but I still felt itchy all over.  Today (Monday), I still don&#39;t feel like myself, but it is the best I have felt since receiving the vaccine. I have never experienced anything like this and was miserable Thursday night, Friday and some of Saturday. It truly was a terrible experience.

                                                I started getting a body aches, a headache and chills around 6 p.m. the night that I got the vaccine. I ended up having a 102 degree fever later in the night with continued body aches, nausea, headache and chills. The morning after I got the vaccine I woke up feeling disoriented and nauseous. I had several spells of dry heaving that morning and a headache and body aches most of the day . I had soreness at the injection site for about a week.

                                                Woke up between 10:30 and 11pm night of vaccine administration with full body shaking and shortness of breath. It?s unclear if shortness of breath was a direct result of the severity or the shaking or something else underlying the shakes. Walking or standing for any period of time was nearly impossible. I felt too warm and too cold at the same time and felt myself sweating but also shivering. My temperature was 99.6 (high for me - I?m usually low, around 96-97 on average) which persisted until around 5:30-6am the following morning. A severely painful, throbbing headache was present until well into the next evening. The symptoms of the headache did subside with use of OTC extra strength Tylenol (2 oral every 6 hours, taken twice totally 4 over the course of 24 hrs) but the headache was still felt somewhat even with use of Tylenol. Moderate fatigue was present all of 4/9 and until around mid morning of 4/10. Pain at the injection site was present but only noticed if laying on the affected arm (left) or if the site was accidentally touched. Dull aching at the site was felt on occasion until the following Monday, 4/12. All other symptoms had fully subsided by 4/10. As of today, 4/13, I am symptom free but I have noticed that I am taking deep breaths every once in a while (maybe several times an hour) as if I?m trying to catch my breath/I can?t catch a full satisfying breath. It feels somewhat like breathing through a straw for a few moments and I breath in until a full breath ?catchs?.

The following day I was dizzy, tired, running a fever, and my injection site was very sore. I could not lift my arm above my head without being in pain. I was not able to eat anything the entire day. I attempted to eat some soup but threw it up. I woke up at 3am on Wednesday morning and drank some water but within 10mins I threw that up along with blood. At one point when I checked my temperature it was 104.8. By Wednesday afternoon I was still not able to eat anything but I was able to drink Gatorade. My fever did not break until Thursday afternoon. I was able to go back to work on Friday but my arm still hurt and was red and swollen. The injection site began to itch on Friday and continued all weekend. On Sunday my hand of the arm that had the injection got swollen for about an hour. It is now Tuesday of the week following my vaccine and I feel fine but my injection site is now purple.

My left arm was tingling , this lasted the rest of the night. The next day i experienced numbness/tingling and dull aching pain in my elbow, down my arm to my palm and two fingers (middle and ring). This has been intermittent for a week now, really effecting me while i drive and work as a travel nurse.

                                                Headache that night of the shot (within an hour or two of the shot). That lasted until Thursday evening and going into Friday. I didn&#39;t wake up with it. I took 600 mg of Ibuprofen at bedtime on Wednesday. Didn&#39;t wake up with the headache Thursday. I started getting  body aches all over my body on Wednesday and they got worse until about 2:30 and I took a 15 min nap and woke up and felt a little better but I had them all the way to bedtime. And I was cold. That was until 1:00 PM on Wednesday. Wednesday night at 06:00 pm, on my left foot from arch to my toes I had a hot sensation. I thought one of my pets had pied on my foot - hot and wet feeling. But they didn&#39;t. That  has been happening frequently and intermittently and I am still experiencing them. The level of heat has decreased - it it warm and wet instead of hot and wet feeling. Happens frequently throughout the day. On Friday, I noticed, I had a rash on my left forearm. I noticed it on Friday evening and that went away on Thursday of last week after I was able to be hydrocortisone ointment on it for a few days. The rash was really itchy.

I have gotten many shots in my adult life and have never done this. About a week after the vaccine, the normal shot soreness began to turn into extreme stiffness. I experienced weakness and loss of range of motion as well as pain in my left arm.

Within 5 minutes after receiving injection I got up and walked less than 10 feet when I began experiencing extreme dizziness, ringing in the ears, lightheadedness, felt warm, and began to feel chills/tingling throughout my whole body but especially in my head.  I ended up passing out and was unable to sit up in a chair without assistance. For about 10 minutes I was profusely sweating all over my entire body, had continued chills/tingling, difficulty breathing and was semi coherent. The nurse at the pharmacy had me sniff ammonia salt and gave me water to help. I waited for 20 more minutes before finally feeling able to get up and walk around the store. Body chills and cold sweats continued for a while but no further symptoms at this time (2hrs after vaccination).

                                                About 7 hours or so after I was vaccinated I began to feel a pulsing type of headache, but i was tired so I fell asleep. About 3 hours later (around 6am) I woke up with the worst headache I&#39;ve ever felt. On a  pain scale of 0 to 10 it was a solid 10. It was a splitting headache, a pulsing and crippling pain, it was also sensitive to light. Every time I moved or changed the direction in which I was looking the pain would surge through my head and paralyzed me. I took 1000 MG of acetaminophen and then half an hour later I took 800 MG of ibuprofen. The headache calmed down a for a while, but 8 hours later I was already feeling just as bad as when I felt the headache the worst, so I took another dose of acetaminophen and ibuprofen. The entire day went on like that, along with body aches, some nausea and fatigue. Throughout the next four days,  all of those symptoms gradually diminished. On the third day after vaccination, the injection site felt very sore; my whole arm would hurt every time I moved it.

My muscles hurt and a body felt very fatigued. Also, a little bit nauseous. I think my fever got to 100 degrees. By noon, I broke my fever. By three pm I was fine again.  The following days, I had soreness at injection site. I had a couple of headaches. There was one  episode where two weeks later, I did get a panic attack and went to urgent care. I went because it lasted longer than normal. This panic attack lasted for 30 minutes that is why I went to Urgent Care. Usually my panic attacks last for 3 minutes - but I also had personal things going on that could have caused it. No treatment, they just said to relax.

HR 140s. pt is A/O x3. &#43; nasuea, chills fever 101.2. denies throat swelling or SOB. pt presents with swelling at vaccine site and rash to both shoulder blades She does feel lightheaded and dizzy.  Denies any recent illnesses.  Denies any prior intolerance to vaccines. Fever 101.7F Patient has low-grade fever but nontoxic-appearing.   Blood work shows mild leukocytosis with left shift likely reactive otherwise within normal limits.   After 3 L of IV fluids she remains persistently tachycardic in the high 130s to 140s. Additional information for Item 18:  She states she was feeling fine prior to her vaccine, denies any recent illness, sick contacts, recent travel, CP, SOB, abd pain, dysuria. After eating and drinking patient states she feels a little nauseous and having some indigestion so was given some more Zofran and Maalox.   She continues to be presenting tachycardic in the 130s.   Given the rest of the reassuring ED work-up I think this is likely autoimmune response to the vaccine however given her current heart rate I cannot discharge her safely.   Will admit her to medicine team for observation.   SIRS, likely 2/2 vaccine - hold off on antibiotics for now without clear source of infection, procalcitonin negative - tylenol prn for fever   Principal Problem:   SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) Active Problems:   Tachycardia   Asthma  3/12 discharge summary She was given 3L IVF bolus in the ED -- still tachycardic in the 110s, fever has improved.  There was concern for adverse reaction to vaccine and she was given prednisone 60 mg x 1 in the ED.  Her symptoms have improved and she is able to tolerate PO without vomiting.  Of note, she says her entire family had a respiratory viral illness approx 1 year ago which her PCP suspected was COVID 19, but were unable to be tested at the time.     Fever has resolved, has been afebrile x24 hours, leukocytosis has resolved   tachycardia has improved although still HR in the 110&#39;s with ambulation, ordered an echo however patient did not want to stay wanted to follow-up with PCP and have this done there.   Vital signs have been stable, patient states back to her baseline and feeling great.  Would like to go home.

Woke up next day with all symptoms gone except the swollen, painful lump in my arm at the injection site, which I still have as of today, June 10th.  It&#39;s not getting any smaller. If the lump and pain doesn&#39;t go away by Monday, I will be visiting my doctor again.

                                                4/8: Immediate injection site numbness and dizziness. As day wore on, I felt fatigued and later developed a fever ranging around 100.5°F. Throughout the night, I had body chills, muscle and joint pain as well as skin sensitivity. 4/9: Fever ranged from 100.5°F to 101.1°F. Dizziness, fatigue, headache, chills, muscle and joint pain, skin sensitivity and nausea. 4/10: Fever ranged from 99.8°F to 100°F. Dizziness, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint pain with mild nausea. 4/11: Fever ended. Mild dizziness, fatigue, muscle and joint pain. Around mid-day, both arms went numb with tingling/prickling pain from shoulders to fingertips. Could not open and close hands well. Could not hold, grasp, text or type/weakness in hands. Pain: 7-8/10. 4/12: Severe numbness. Noticing pain radiating from behind both elbows and going up to the shoulders as well as down to fingertips. Weakness in hands. 4/13: Went to school clinic and referred to ER for testing. Was given ibuprofen and told to take OTC painkillers. 4/19: Issues with insurance/unable to schedule follow-up with neurology in home town due to insurance based in nearby city but I am unable to drive and school is still in session. Telehealth call with PCP to go over options. Left arm is slightly improving but still going numb/tingly/prickly occasionally with pain radiating from behind elbow. Pain: 5-6/10. No improvement in right arm with pain and numbness being constant. Noticing slight pain behind left knee. Pain: 3/10. Purchased hand brace and arm sling for right arm. Taking Advil but noticing little to no relief. Use of warm and cold compresses as well as massage instead to help alleviate pain. 4/29: Attempted performing everyday tasks and school assignments for ceramics. Exasperated both arms. Severe numbness and tingly/prickly pain. Pain: 8-9/10. Left knee pain has not dissipated/becoming more and more noticeable.  Pain: 3-4/10. 5/4: Intense pain decreased back to usual pain levels. Noticed swelling behind left knee and pain going down to calf muscle. 5/6: Appt w/ school clinic again. Referred to ortho doctor on 5/13 and prescribed Celecoxib 200 mg. 5/12: Appt w/ school clinic. Saw ortho doc. Diagnosed with potential Baker&#39;s Cyst. Sent to ER to double check for blood clots. There was none. Diagnosis is potential Baker&#39;s Cyst or Meniscus Tears. Was prescribed Diclofenac Sodium 1% Gel and told to wrap knee. 5/13: MRI of full cervical spine with and without contrast done at Radiology at another city. 5/26: Left arm is almost completely recovered. Pain: 2/10. Still slight pain behind left elbow. If overused, however, more pain and numbness. Right arm is constantly in pain but it is not as severe as previous month. Pain is 6/10 and runs from shoulder to fingertips but more prevalent around shoulders to behind left elbow and wrist. Shoulder pain feels like burning pain instead of usual tingly/prickly pain like the rest of the arm. Left knee gives out randomly and I feel pain from behind knee to calf whenever standing for long periods of time or walking for more than 20-30 minutes. Pain 2-3/10. 6/1: Telehealth appointment with PCP to go over test results. Referred for neuro consult. Was prescribed medication for neuropathy but currently meds are with mother in a city. Unable to drive from city to city to pick it up. 6/8: Telehealth appointment with neuro consult. Waiting on referral for nerve conduction study. Pain has not changed for right arm or behind left knee. Decreased walking due to more frequent moments of knee giving out.  Overall, due to constant arm pain in dominant arm (right arm),  I am unable to do most activities without assistance such as cooking, cleaning or driving. Right arm/shoulder get exhausted fairly quickly or nerves become inflamed when attempting to use it more. Shoulder feels like it&#39;s burning slightly. Sometimes hand/arm will shake and feel a spike of pain when overused. Must do things more with left arm and can not walk far without falling down randomly due to left knee giving out.

                                                Headache for first 24 hours and feeling achy. I felt sluggish around 8:00PM. My mom woke me up in the morning because I was burning up and I took a Tylenol. When I woke up, I had a massive headache and feeling achy all over. Had the headache for about 24 hours and feeling achy.  I did go to work later that day, still, I was just a bit sluggish, brain-foggish and achy. I had the brain fog for a few days. I have been having a headache most days - not every day though. Right now she has me taking some magnesium and some Riboflavin to see if that will help. I hydrate quite a bit. June 8th, Rash on my neck - itchy and burning sensation. I applied Cortisone but it wouldn&#39;t go away. On the 11th, I called doctor because it was getting bigger and going across my neck. She told me to stop taking that and she prescribed for me some  Clotrimazole  but I stopped taking it - it seemed to make the rash worse and one day my throat was closing  up and I went to the ER and I took Benadryl before I went in. By time that I got there to see the doctor, it wasn&#39;t so bad. Diagnosed at ER with Contact dermatitis - is diagnosis - and they prescribed a medicine for it - Prednisone and to continue taking Benadryl until the rash disappeared/healed. After about 3 days of that, it seemed to be going away. Right now, it&#39;s healed but there&#39;s still marks from it. There is still a small patch of the rash that is on my neck (where it originated)  there and my doctor said to leave it alone for right now. Recently, I have been experiencing some leg pain on my left leg. It&#39;s been hurting lately. Doctor has prescribed an ultrasound to look at my calf and my foot.

By 4pm I had a headache, body aches, upset stomach, tired, fever, and chills. My fever would go up and down, highest was 103.2 reached that temp 3 times. By 2am my mother drove me to the ER. I was diagnosed with a migraine and was given IV fluids and an IV migraine cocktail. After receiving the fluids and meds I felt much better and was released back home. I periodically have pain in the injection site.

                                                Right after I received my vaccine I was told to pull up and wait 15 minutes. After about 2 minutes I started to feel hot and noticed my arm was red. I pulled down my visor and used the mirror to look at my face and chest area and noticed red splotches all over. The rash quickly moved to cover my whole body within minutes of receiving the vaccine. Ochsner had me pull over by the EMT tent and I waited 45 additional minutes to see if I had any other effects. The rash didn&#39;t go away but I didn&#39;t itch and I wasn&#39;t uncomfortable. It was just a surface rash. The rash was completely gone by 10PM that same night. I woke up at 2AM that same night/early the next morning and the whole left side of my body was numb and felt very heavy. I also had a very mild fever and cold like symptoms. These symptoms included chills, dizziness, fatigue, and headaches. All of my symptoms, including the pain and heaviness on my left side, were gone the following morning which was about 36 hours after first receiving the vaccine.

A few minutes later she fainted and fell out of the chair onto the floor. We helped her up to a sitting position and gave her a bottle of water and an ice pack.  The right side of her forehead appeared red from apparent hit on the floor when she fainted.  We had her wait on the floor for about 30 minutes to ensure she remained conscious.  Patient reported an ache on her forehead at site of hit.  She was also sweating and reported feeling hot. Patient had a partner with her who agreed to escort her to an urgent care clinic in the same building as the pharmacy. Store manager in charge took the patient to the urgent care clinic by wheelchair to be examined.

Concerned my bone was hit with a too long vaccine needle. Had chills/fever evening of 4/4/2021 into morning of 4/6/2021?had to take off work. Have had neurological symptoms ongoing with ?brain fogginess? since 4/5/2021. On 4/6/2021, began to see flashes/spots of light in vision of left eye, which worsened through today. Took off afternoon from work and went to an eye clinic to have eye dilated and looked at, but the spots in vision continue through reporting time (4/7/2021, 5pm CT).

                                                At around 6:30 p.m on April 9, 2021, I started to feel very cold at home. I had sever chills where I was under 5 heavy blankets unable to get warm. I also had a high fever which was 104.8 degrees Fahrenheit. I also threw up twice and had body aches in my arm where the nurse injected the vaccine, my lower back, and calves of my legs. When my temperature did not go down, I went to Emergency Room at around 12:00 a.m. April 10, 2021. I was placed in isolation. The nurse took my vitals and the doctor ordered covid test for me and a urine analysis. The covid test came back negative and my urine analysis was in the normal range. The nurse gave me Tynenol at  around 1 am and ibuprofen at around 2:30 am. I was discharged at approximately 5 am on April 10, 2021 with a 98.4 degree temperature.

                                                -Dibilitating headache came on slowly starting around 4pm day of vaccine (roughly 60-90 minutes following) Built in intensity and the following morning throughout the day after vaccine was causing dizziness to the point of motionsickness and vomiting when moved too much. headache hit peak at 24 hrs post vaccination and slowly decreased in intensity until about 48 hrs post vaccination. Took advil throughout. -Full body shivers despite warm or hot environment and comfort level Beginning about 30 hrs post vaccination vaccination and lasting about 6 hrs.  -Large bump at vaccination point started developing 72 hrs post vaccination. By 5 days post it was the diameter of roughly a baseball but only slightly raised, hot to the touch, very painful, restricted arm function and itched. That evening before bed (5 days post) self treated with 20 minute ice pack,  hydrocortizone cream and performing deep massage moving outward from vaccination point as long as could tolerate pain. Noticed extreme improvement the next morning: area had cooled to regular body temperature marked improvement in pain, size and fuctionality. Repeated &#34;treatment&#34; that evening (6 days post) and today (a few hours shy of 7 days post) area is still itchy, knot has decreased to the size of a bean, pain gone except when poked like a bruise. I will likely repeat self prescribed treatment more time.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA On 4/13/2021, I work up and noticed a rash on both of my hands and wrists consisting of little small red docs about the size of a pencil eraser.  That night, my knees where very itchy and I noticed the rash was on my knees, thighs and hips.  On 4/14/2021, I woke up and the rash was all over my body from the neck down.  My left arm was very red with my right arm not having as much redness.  My knees very extremely red with little normal skin color showing.  The rash was slightly itchy.

                                                From the moment I was injected I felt a sharp shooting pain from the injection site down to my elbow. This was constant for about 2 weeks and up until now it is frequent with some intermittent relief. It is a deep pain that still radiates the entire upper portion of my injected arm (left arm).. at this point, I am unsure if this could be permanent and result in testing.

Immediately had a phone appointment with primary who advised to take benadryl and go to hospital if it gets any worse. Immediately went to get benadryl and by the time I got to the pharmacy, my lips and tongue were completely numb. Benadryl was effective, hives and scratchy throat persisted for 10 days.

                                                About 24-36 hours after receiving the vaccine I experienced pain/burning on my labia (the outside, not inside). After inspecting it myself I realized I had multiple lesions 2 days post vax. I saw a nurse practitioner and I went on anti virals prescribed by a local woman?s clinic for suspected herpes which cleared things up within the 10 day regimen. They immediately did a swab of the area for suspected herpes simplex which was negative. I have since done 4&#43; herpes simplex 1 and 2 tests (blood and swab) and all have been negative. I have also done HIV, RPR, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and auto immune blood tests (and more) and all results have been negative. The issue is now cleared but my PCP wanted to find the root cause of the issue and potential underlying condition.   I have a history of shingles on my back/shoulder and the pain/lesions appeared similar in nature but presented on both sides of my labia in this situation (though much more on one side than the other). My last major outbreak on my back/shoulder was in 2010-2011. This was the only outbreak in which lesions appeared though I sometimes feel the area tingle/tense up when under stress or sick.   In addition to the lesions, I had typical flu like symptoms after the vaccine that began about 8 hours after and lasted for 2-3 days.

                                                Almost immediately after the vaccine at the injection site I  got a real bad hot sensation.  For about 2 days it was swollen and had localized pain for about 9 days.  I was very fatigued.   And I developed a severe headache the next day that was so bad I could barely stand it.  4/11 I  went to the Primary Care and saw a  dr who took bloodwork and prescribed some iron because she said I was anemic.  But for about the first 3 days after the vaccine the headache pain intensity level was at a 10, then it lowered on its on to about a level 3 but was still there for about 3 more days and after about day 6 the headache intensity returned to a level 10 and on day 8 I went back to the dr because nothing would relieve the pain and the pain was so intense I couldnt bare it.  I had an MRI on 4/21 which came back normal with sinus pressure present and finally about 4/23 the headaches finally subsided.   I also notice  the next 2 menustral cycles  after I had severe cramping and my breast got really tender and sore and I bled longer than usual which is abnormal for me and I also noticed I had developed a cyst in my right breast and had a mammogram performed which did show that I had a large cyst in my breast

I instructed patient to hydrate and minimize activity for the rest of the day if rash returns take a benadryl.

Could only sleep short spurts after taking 400 mg of Ibuprofen. 24 hours after the vaccination, my body is still achey, sore at injection site, and uneasy stomach.

Then later around 10:00am a feeling of tiredness came over my whole body.  Around 12:00pm I felt even more tired, lightheaded  and my eyeballs felt as if with high pressure in them and are feel sensitive to the sunlight.  Also, at 12pm, I had lunch, which was my first meal of this day and felt the necessity to lay in bed and take a nap for 20 minutes before returning to work.  While taking the nap I felt tingling on my feet, arms, hands and neck along with certain sudden muscle contractions on the same parts.

                                                Developed a fever of 104F at 14 hours after injection.  After taking acetaminophen, the fever dropped to around 101 and stayed there for 12 hours before subsiding.  Body aches and extreme fatigue were also present.  48 hours after injection (03/08/2021) I woke up with major skin irritation.  There were no visible signs like a rash or any redness, but my skin felt sunburned and wearing clothes was extremely uncomfortable.  This lasted until 03/10/2021.  I used lotions and took cool showers to help with the symptoms.

                                                About 6 hours after vaccination on 3/8, flu-like symptoms: chills, weakness, fatigue, headache. That lasted into the following ~1.5 days and was relieved with Tylenol and bed rest. Mild nausea on 3/9-3/10. The most concerning possible adverse event started on the evening of 3/12. I noticed my achilles area was itchy after taking a shower that night. I woke up the following morning on 3/13 VERY itchy on my left arm and ankles. I started to break out in hives on my lower legs and bilateral arms into the afternoon. I took Benadryl as directed on the package to try and relieve the hives. In the evening on 3/13 I tried taking a lukewarm bath with 1/2 cup of baking soda and epsom salt. After soaking for about 30 minutes, the hives had worsened and about 65% of my body was covered in hives. I called my primary care&#39;s emergency line that night and was prescribed 40mg Pepcid x 7 days and a Methylprednisolone pack to take in addition to the Benadryl. I took the 40mg Pepcid along with Benadryl and was able to relieve most of the hives. I did not take the methylprednisolone at all. I did wake up in the middle of the night with a scratchy throat and took another Benadryl to relieve that. The following morning on 3/14 I woke up and had some hives on my hands that disappeared that early afternoon without having to take Benadryl. In the evening on 3/14 at around 6pm the hives started to reappear on bilateral arms as well as legs. I took the 40mg Pepcid as well as Benadryl and the hives did not completely disappear before bed. The following morning on 3/15 it appears that the hives had disappeared. They did not reappear the following evening but I still took the 40mg Pepcid the evening of 3/15. Today is 3/16 and I have continued to be hive-free. One other detail to note, on 3/15 at around 4 in the afternoon I took an old supplement - Cranberry with Vitamin C. So I am not sure if this reaction was related to the expired supplement, the vaccine, or both.

On March 11 I broke out in hives on both arms, both thighs, neck/clavicle, and lower right leg this started around 8am. After work I went to Pharmacy to their consultation window (2:15) and they recommended benadryl and to call my PCP. I took my first dose at 2:30pm and followed up with a second one around 9pm. I called and  spoke with my PCP over the phone, she had me take benadryl at night for the next 3 days and claritin in the morning for the next 3 days.  The hives and redness were gone by the morning of the  12th. My skin was still sensitive throughout the 12th but was back to normal by the time I went to bed on the 12 (10pm ish)

                                                At 0700, a splotchy red rash appeared in my wrists and feet. It was not raised up and had an irregular border and was very very itchy. By 1000, the rash was splotchy up to my ankles and onto my forearm. By 1400, the entirety of my forearms were solid red rash, and I had large splotches on my calves, thighs, and upper arm. By 1800, the rash was only on my shoulder area, but lower body was still very red. My entire right leg from ankle to hip was red splotchy and my left leg from knee up. I had 2 splotches on my hips. I took 1 benadryl at this time and went to bed. I woke up on 3/18/21 with a few light splotches on my chest but no where else. This faded By 1000 and I do not have any rash now.

                                                I received the vaccine at 36 weeks pregnant. I am estimated to deliver April 16th.  About 8 hours after receiving the vaccine I noticed general bodily discomfort and achiness, as well as a loss of appetite and a headache. About 30 minutes after that I developed chills but no fever, and was fatigued enough to fall asleep an hour before my usual bedtime. I slept terribly in the night due to the achiness and pain at the injection site making it hard to lay on my side, which I have to do for pregnancy. I went to bed with chills but woke up sweating and discovered a fever of 100.2 around 12:45 AM. By 5:30 my temperature was down to 98. The following morning I continue to experience achiness, fatigue, decreased appetite, and a headache. I seem to have felt some pelvic cramping associated with pregnancy but it may be unrelated.

                                                About 24 hours later, I noticed a rash the size of quarter. On Tuesday, the rash was bigger and it was swollen underneath - the lump underneath it was the size of a golf ball. Wednesday and Thursday - Nurse measured it had rash top was 7 cm and the lump underneath was the size of my palm (much bigger). It was really painful and really itchy.  On Thursday, I did a telehealth video chat - and I showed it to the doctor and that&#39;s when I went to the clinic where the nurse measured it. Treatment was given: Steroid cream - called Triamcinolone. I used it that night and by the next day the redness had gone down 50% and the lump decrease, also. I have been using it twice a day since Thursday. Today the redness is gone and the lump is maybe the size of a quarter.  It&#39;s about 90% better but not completely gone.

                                                After being administered the vaccine at 7:12 am, when the nurse stood me up and started to walk me to the holding area, I became dizzy, my legs got weak, and there was a loud ringing in my ears. I nearly collapsed as I reached the seat in the holding area they were taking me to. I placed one 0.5MG tablet of my prescription Alprazolam in my mouth and waited for the nurse to bring water. They took me via wheelchair from the holding area to a secluded spot behind a curtain. There, I laid on a cot, received cold water, and a nurse talked to me while I recovered. It felt like I was having an anxiety attack, which has never happened to me after getting a shot before. Fitbit heart rate data shows my heart rate at 105 BPM at 7:00 am (going through the admission process, walking around the facility), 83 BPM at 7:10 am, 79 BPM at 7:15 am, 74 BPM at 7:20 am. Between 8:15 am and 1:25 pm, my heart rate remained between 63 and 89 BPM. My arm was sore and my skin hurt (an issue that I have when I feel very stressed). Additional symptoms arose around 1:35 pm. I began going through cycles of chills, sweating and overheating. My heart rate ranged from 127 BPM and 93 BPM for the remainder of the night. I took Tylenol at 7:07 PM to help with my fever.

                                                Within about 30 mins of the shot I became extremely lethargic. Hard to keep my eyes open. The injection site was extremely hot to touch and very sore. While the rest of my body was of normal temperature. Shortly after, I?d say about 45 minutes after injection, came the cold chills. I was freezing cold and shaking  fallowed by a fever. I became very foggy. It was hard to keep a conversation and had extreme waves of nausea. My mouth would salivate like the vomit was coming. I never actually vomited. But that continued  for the next 36 hours. I had to call out of work yesterday. Starting 24hrs after injection. I could not get out of bed. My body was very weak. Aches everywhere, I was freezing cold shaking with chills yet waking up in my bed covered in sweat. I was extremely restless and kept waking up to put a cold towel on my head to try to break my fever. At this point my headache was so severe. Any movement felt like my head would explode.  It?s now 48 hours after the injection my head is still pounding and my body still full of aches. Left arm is still really sore. I truly regret taking the vaccine. And would recommend others to not take it until further testing goes into this product.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I began by feeling stiffness and soreness in my joints and muscles, particularly my back and lower body.  The pain and stiffness worsened, and I began to feel ill similar to a common cold. Approximately 12-18 hours after receiving the vaccine, my symptoms worsened so much that I could hardly stand or move around, and began throwing up. This continued and worsened as my entire body felt pain and stiffness, I felt very weak and fatigued, and I was throwing up violently with frequency. I threw up so much and with enough force that I started to see bright red blood in my spittle and vomit. I had a severe headache accompanying these other symptoms.  I also had problems with homeostatic temperature regulation  and was simultaneously sweating profusely and very warm to the touch while feeling like I was cold.  I was shaky and experienced tremors and twitches in my hands, arms, legs, and feet. I kept throwing up and experiencing these symptoms for approximately 72 hours after recieving my vaccine.  I was virtually incapacitated for those three days of severe illness-like symptoms.

                                                Six hours after injection of vaccine, I experienced nausea, moderate chills, headache, and a low fever which lasted for 6 hours. I also had numb fingertips which lasted for around 20 minutes right after the chills really set in. I&#39;m not positive its related but two nights after my vaccine injection, I woke up at night because my feet were itching and hot. They also had the pins and needles sensation and these symptoms lasted around 20 to 30 minutes. I have never had that happen before so I assume it was vaccine related.

On 4/14, 6 days after receiving the Janssen vaccine, I started to break out in an itchy rash at about 5:30pm. It started on my left calf, and over the course of the next couple hours it spread to my left arm (bicep area), right arm (bicep area), right calf and knee, and left thigh. The areas were red, hot, and itchy, with some larger raised welts scattered through the area.   It didn?t seem to respond to Benedryl, but I was able to sleep after liberally applying hydrocortisone cream. It seemed better in the morning, with a few lingering patches by the knees. However, at about 1:30pm it came back, this time mostly covering new places- lower back, shoulders, forearms, stomach.

                                                On March 6, 2021, I received the Johnson and Johnson Vaccination at about 8:15 am.  Around 7:00 pm that evening I started to experience the normal symptoms that they had advertised. Yes, I felt like I COVID again for about 48 hours, but nothing alarming.   On March 12, 2021, I went to an appointment with doctor due to extreme abdominal cramping and very heavy period.  This is not totally out of the norm due to my infertility, but I felt like something was off. I had random abdominal bruising and ruptured cyst pain; which I am still experiencing. She ordered an ultrasound to rule out a mass in my uterus due to the extreme pain and bruising.   On March 22, 2021, I woke up at 3:00 am with extreme stomach pain and extreme diarrhea.  As the morning went on I began to feel worse and worse. Other symptoms I experienced were; severe headache, shortness of breath, heartburn (I felt like I was having a heart attack), nausea, back pain, and extremely tired.  At 6:30 am  took me to the ER due to my worsening symptoms. Everything checked out fine and they thought I could have an ulcer, but I wanted to make you aware of these symptoms that I experienced.   I still have days that I experience some of these symptoms, but they have been under control and monitored closely.

Saturday  4/10 , monday 4/19 the same occured. I saw a hematologist as I was concerned, pending more bloodwork.

                                                Began on 3/26/21 with numbness in face. Woke up on 3/27 with numbness in feet. Spread to my feet and up legs and arms through next couple days. Fatigue increased dramatically, though it was present prior. Dizziness, sharp pains in left ear in skull, nerve issues. The following is a log from when the symptoms became most intense, so significant I have not been able to drive myself and been working from home due to balance issues, no feeling in feet, and neurological symptoms. After different a week and a half,, i sought medical care and began logging daily as follows:   Fri 4/9: fatigue was high, neuropathy present. Balance was off. Stabbing sharp pains into the left ear but behind the ear in head. Dizzy spells with static feeling rush in forehead lasting a few seconds and passing. Gate while walking feels awkward and difficult. Think walking after sprinting on a treadmill plus&#39;s stiffness   Sat 4/10: couldn&#39;t eat. General malaise. Fatigue. Neuropathy and balance issues present. Gate slightly improved. Noted increase in joint pain and popping in wrists elbows hips and knees. Needed white noise to cover ear ringing to sleep.   Sun 4/11: feeling a bit better. Able to eat. Gastric issues after eating. Slightly more energy but neuropathy and balance was frustrating like superglue on my fingers and areas of my feet with no feeling at all surrounded by pins and needles. Aching in wrists and pain shooting down through to heel of my foot. Ear ringing more noticeable. Two instances of ice pick ear pain.   Monday 4/12: neuropathy present, balance improved. No digestive issues. Feeling more stable while walking. Still numb in hands and feet and part of my face but less pronounced. Ear ringing unbearably loud and constant.   Tuesday 4/13: slightly less energy but neuropathy still seems improved and not losing balance as much. Ears obnoxious, joints popping and cracking constantly. Pain in wrists and hands. One instance of ice pick ear pain   Wednesday: same as Tuesday, but no ear pains. Had to take a nap in the middle of the day due to worn out feeling. Laying in bed felt something in my back snap, then a stabbing pain into my lower right side of my back. Aching like the skin was hurting for hours.    Thursday: other symptoms same as Tuesday. Ears ringing crazy loud, stiff in the hips more noticeably. Neuropathy present with dizzy waves/vertigo. Low back skin pain right side continue. Also right hip. Gate while walking is starting to feel like it did before after a few days of improvement.   Friday: back still hurting. Neuropathy increased. More numbness than previous few days. Very stiff throughout lower back hips and legs. Low back pain. Gate while walking feels awkward and robotic. Ears ringing. Joints throughout cracking/popping. This is not historically common for me.

                                                The day after I experienced extreme muscle and joint pain that lasted about a week. And it started to get better but the following Saturday I got a very terrible headache. And over the course of that week I started bruising very easily and all the veins all over my body were very prominent. The headache wouldn&#39;t go away and I started to have chest pain by that monday. And at that point all the muscle and joint pain came back and it was very very painful. At that point I called my primary care provider and they scheduled me with someone else in the clinic because i was having the chest pain. And they did a test for covid and urged me to go to the emergency room, which i did. After that I went to the emergency room and sat for 5 hours, they did bloodwork to check clotting factor, basic blood panel and also a CT of my head. According to them, everything was normal and they sent me home with a terrible headache. My biggest complaint was the bruising all over my body but no one ever looked at that.

                                                About 7 hours after, I developed a fever of 103 that lasted about 12 hours. On 5/25, I woke up with a rash/hives that covered my chest, stomach and back, which I still have. I went to the urgent care and was given steroids, Benadryl and Pepcid. The meds stopped them from spreading, but they didn&#39;t go away. On 5/31, I went back to urgent care due to it spreading more onto my neck, bottom and starting to do down my thighs. It looks like little burns all over my body. They are thinking I got it because my body was trying to fight off the vaccine due to my deficiency. I was put on 12 days of steroids to prevent it from continuing to spread, the inflammation and itching. She diagnosed it as Pityriasis Rosea. She said that I will have this rash for approx 4-8 weeks.

Approximitely 8 days later, my entire body broke out in what looked like measles &amp; hives. It was extremely itchy and sensitive; it was treated with steriod pack via Urgent Care, where the Dr. confirmed that this was an allergic reaction to COVID-19 vax.

Itching started the day after rash appeared. Rash appeared 6/13 and itching started morning of 6/14. Monitoring the site to see if it gets any bigger, if so then will have to seek medical. I do take a high level oral otc allergy medication everyday ( Allegra 24hr) so I cannot take anymore allergy medication for the day.

I also experienced a full body rash, not on my palms or soles of my feet or face but I did have the rash everywhere else. It was itchy, on a scale 6-7 out of 10 on VAS scale, persistent, pervasive and my PCP diagnosed me with pyrethrum rosacea. There was a patch on my back examined by my PCP.  My PCP told me it would go away on its own, also gave me a prescription Aciclovir, low dose (25mg) for treatment.  As far as today, my rash is still present, comes and goes and I have mild itchiness in more areas of my body and also the back of my knees.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Mid Saturday night I woke up to chills and was shaking so bad I couldn&#39;t fall back asleep even after adding another layer of clothes and blanket. Sunday morning I was still very cold and tired from not sleeping. I developed body aches but they were everywhere not just my arm. I was very fatigued and didn&#39;t have an appetite. The worst part was getting a migraine with extreme light sensitivity. I couldn&#39;t stand to be around any windows without blinds. I spent the day in my bedroom sleeping with the curtains closed and an eye mask on. By that night, the migraine had subsided but I was adding hot flashes to the problem list. Had a pretty restless night again on Sunday. Woke up Monday to the light sensitivity back but not as severe. I took the day off work because I couldn&#39;t handle looking at a computer screen all day. By about 1pm I was feeling mostly back to normal. My arm is still sore near the injection site and I&#39;m a bit fatigued at times but those are the only things remaining.

                                                I?ve never had an allergic reaction to anything before.  Received the vaccine at around 9:55am on 03/08/21.  Pain while the vaccine was being administered but it healed within a few minutes. I started getting a mild headache at around 3:30pm while at work. When I got home at around 6pm I started having severe chills, the headache became intense, my mouth and eyelids felt hot, my hands and feet felt very cold and when I checked temperature it was 102.4.  By 9:00 pm the headache became excruciating like I?ve never had it before, as if my head was being squeezed or pressed. Eyes and the back of my jaw hurt too.  Had light and sound sensitivity. Took 200mg of Advil but pain was still almost intolerable until I was finally able to fall asleep at around 4:00 am.  Was still in pain the day after but not as bad as the night before. Only mild pain today but started feeling itchy tonight and noticed some rashes on my body.

Swelling did not respond to Benadryl. No other allergy symptoms (hives elsewhere, etc.) - Filing this report on Day 16 after vaccine and, while swelling has improved, itching persists and I still have a walnut-sized mass of firm tissue under skin near injection site and patch of redness/discoloration on deltoid. Have been checked by doctor who ensured that reaction is indeed dermatological allergic reaction (not infection).

                                                Most websites said 1-2 days for side effects to kick in but I was rocked pretty hard within the first 12 hours. The biggest symptoms I had were severe body aches, debilitating chills, fluctuating fever, headache, and no appetite.  4/1/21: * 11:15am: Vaccine administered * 12pm-6pm: Arm soreness, feeling cold/experiencing some chills, minor headache and stomach ache (I felt a little off but couldn?t tell if it was real or in my head) * 5:30pm: I walk home from work, which takes about about 35 minutes. Regret the decision about 10 mins from home due to onset body aches and fatigue  * 6pm: I go straight to bed freezing with crippling chills, body aches, and a headache * 8pm: Extreme nausea kicks in, I take Advil and cannot stomach more than one bite of food; still experiencing chills and body pain * 9pm: 100.7 fever, the chills subside and I start to get hot * 10:15pm: I finally eat some food, drink more water, body still aches, start to get chilly again  * 10:45pm: My fever is down to 99.3, my ears really hurt, like, ear-infection-style pain  * 11:15pm: 12ish hours post-vaccine, I have severe body aches, I alternate between really hot and cold, take more Advil and go to bed (finally fall asleep at midnight)  4/2/21: * 6:15am: Wake up; I spent the night tossing and turning with extreme night sweats. At this point I still have a pretty bad headache and painful body aches, specifically in my lower back and legs; fall back asleep * 8am-9am: Wake up and take more Advil. My whole body hurts. Toss and turn for a bit more. Small fever?99 degree temperature. Make coffee but have absolutely no appetite. * 9am-10am: So sweaty, fever is fully breaking * 11am: No more fever, slight headache, and body aches seem to be subsiding * 11:45am: Almost exactly 24 hours later and feeling good, comparatively speaking. Finally eat a bagel * 5:30pm: After lunch, I took a nap. My body aches have completely subsided, no fever. I still have a small headache and my ears still ache. But overall, I feel pretty normal! Just a little tired but probably from lack of sleep last night.

                                                5 hours after injection I got a headache, 101.0 fever, chills, full body aches, sever nausea and vomiting (every 20-30 minutes for 20 hours). Vomiting and Nausea subsided after 20 hours (25 hours after injection). Fever, chills, strong body aches (especially in legs) and headache lasted another 24 hours. It is now 72 hours post injections. Only remaining symptom is mild soreness at injection side but digestive system is still trying to recover from the intense vomiting that lasts 20 hours. I probably should have gone to the hospital but I don&#39;t have insurance so I tried to wait it out because I can&#39;t afford the bill and luckily I seem to be ok now.

                                                Roughly 10 hours after injection, moderate muscular pain at injection site, and severe pain in old lower back injury - chronic bulging disc. Back pain onset was severe enough to wake me up from sleep and persisted despite use of OTC pain management. Used 2x extra-strength 500mg acetaminophen, only dulled pain, then 600mg ibuprofen approximately 8 hours later to same result. As of 27 hours post injection, pain is still moderate and disruptive. Lack of sleep and pain make it hard to determine if the fatigue is a unique symptom or purely the result of the pain symptoms. In a non-measurable manner, having had this back injury for over 10 years with multiple reoccurrences, it feels like the joint/disk swelled enough for it to press on the spinal nerves despite attempts to mitigate with ice, elevating feet and head to open intervertebral space.

                                                I received the vaccine at 3:50 pm and by 9:45 I had the typical side effects --muscle aches, minor pain at the injection site, and chills.  Within an hour from that I also had a terrible headache, nausea, and my skin hurt to touch.  I slept most of the next day, save for 5 or 6 hours.  Starting on 3/30/21 (exactly two weeks from receiving my vaccine) I started having sore skin.  No rash, red marks, itching, just hypersensitive to touch, even with clothing.  This started on my right arm right above the elbow.  The following day the pain had moved to inside both arms right above the elbow.  The day after that, the pain was more intense and was straight across my stomach at belly button height, and across my lower back at that same height.  It was more intense for two days and hurt whether anything was touching my skin or not.  It was very uncomfortable.  In the days following it continued to move to different places on my body.  Legs, bottom of feet, palms of hands, ankles, hips, groin, lower back.    Sometimes it just hurts, sometimes it&#39;s like a prickling, sometimes the skin in that area aches -- especially when on my hands. It&#39;s also very sensitive to anything cold.  Again, if you look at my skin though you can&#39;t see anything.  There&#39;s no visible signs of something being wrong.  It also stopped for a day or so, or just lessened so much that it wasn&#39;t that noticeable, but then returns.  That&#39;s happened twice where I thought this was finally over, only to have it return the next day.

Put on compression socks but the restless leg and shortness of breath continued for 3/4 hours.

                                                I received J&amp;J vaccine on 31st March. I?m 32 years old woman.  I?m currently out of states, I came to another Country on 9th April. About 2days ago, I observed some tiny spots on my fingers (3 on middle finger, and 1 on ring finger - refer attached image). Also, at the same time I felt little disorientation where I was almost blank for just few seconds. I believe that might be due to empty stomach/low sugar. And then, I?m having a headache today.  After the vaccination, I had a fever of 102.7 degrees for about 2days.  I?m just concerned that this is nothing to worry about. And, if there are some blood tests or scans that I should get done just to be safe.

Second day after shot arm got a knot at the Injection site  and started to turn red, get hot, and swollen.  Red spot grew in size for 5 days. Took benadryl and the heat and inflammation went away in 2 days. Lump/knot is still the same size as day 2 on day 9. Ice packs didn&#39;t help. Dr is having me rub the knot and apply heat as much as possible along with taking over the counter anti-inflammatory. Lymph nodes behind ears have now swollen.

The fever and muscle aches lasted until the following morning. Around 12pm is when I began expecting some stomach discomfort/sharp pains on the upper left hand side of my stomach. It began to increase in intensity around 4pm when I began to get nauseous. 5-6pm is when I began vomitting, and decided to go to the ER after the pain reached a level 8-9 and my face and limbs felt numb. I was admitted to the emergency room at 11:30pm and was given a CT Scan where it was discovered I had appendicitis. Wednesday evening I underwent surgery, and was discharged Thursday 4/15. I am still experiencing a slight fever and soreness at the injection site on my left arm.

I had a slight droop on the l eft side of my face, mostly noticeable around the corner of my mouth. I also experienced itchiness around the injection site. The symptoms started with numbness in the tip of my tongue about 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine and slowly spread to the rest of my face. Approximately 5 hours after receiving the vaccine the entire left side of my face was numb. I called a nurse hotline to find out if I should seek medical care that night or wait until morning. They urged me to go to the ER.   I went to the ER, underwent a plethora of tests, received positive results on all of them, and was sent home with instructions to return if my condition worsened. The doctors said I had Bell?s Palsy but had little insight as to why it had occurred.  a nurse hotline

I also have headaches that wont stop with electrical zaps in my head. I also have weird digestion noises located near my liver region. I have developed a rash on all of my neck. I also woke up with the left side of my fact frozen, it took a while for it to start working again. Might be Bells Palsy. Non-stop chest pain which has gone from terrible to manageable over the last 10 days.

A few hours after vaccine, felt weird &#39;brain fog&#39;. This lasted through the following day. Not a typical headache.   6 days later -- experience &#39;brain fog&#39; experience again... again lasted 24-36 hours.  Still able to work as normal , just harder to focus. Also had weird sensations of goosebumps randomly when not cold.   15 days later -- notice that if I rubbed arm near injection site it was sore. Arm not sore at all unless touching it. Then notice a bruise at the site of injection the following day. Also feeling light-headed.

About 2 days after the vaccine, my upper lip was swollen for a few hours after I woke up. This week (about 9-10 days after the vaccine), I noticed red spots and very small bumps on my body, specifically on my left breast, below breasts, and lower stomach areas. It does not itch or hurt. I dont seem to have any other symptoms. I have not had any new foods or used any new products on the affected areas. &#34;

She received her vaccine around 2:00 p.m. She began developing itchiness in her palms/soles of feet and scalp that quickly developed into a a welt like rash about 3-1/2 hours after receiving the vaccine while on a walk with her husband; this was shortly followed by facial swelling over her right eye.  They made it home and she got in a cold shower to cool down, became dizzy, started seeing spots and had difficulty breathing. Her husband called EMS and she was hypotensive when they arrived.  She was given 2 doses of epinephrine (0.2 mg each per ED note) and a dose of Benadryl which helped. Shortly after the 2nd dose, she began having difficulty swallowing, maintaining the ability to breathe through her nose. She was given a 3rd dose of epinephrine and transferred to the ED; during transport an IV was started with an epinephrine drip. She was seen at Emergency Department; she was given IV fluids, solu medrol, tryptase level and had a normal EKG.  She was discharged with an epi pen prescription. Tryptase is still pending at the time of her visit. She started a new prenatal vitamin at 11 am 4/28/21. Otherwise, she reports no new foods, medications or topical products. She did eat before going on a walk, pepper jack cheese, wheat thins, and black bean hummus. She is pretty sure she was not stung by a bee prior to onset of symptoms yesterday.   Interestingly she reports recent urticarial episodes that occurred in February of 2021. These occurred when she was visiting her in-laws and occurred in the middle of the night, 2 nights in a row during the middle of her visit.  She has never had hives previously.  She reports no family history of hives or anaphylaxis.  She reports no use of new topical products or medications.

                                                When I received the J&amp;J shot I had typical side effects (headache, pain at the injection site, and chills) for the first 5-6 days. The side effects subsided and I felt normal. About 3 weeks later I started to have pain at the injection site again which started very mild and then built up to nearly the same pain level I felt after the injection. The pain has since decreased and the pain is in a different part of the muscle. I feel a strong pinch in the muscle, almost like a pinched nerve, when my arm is at certain angles or doing a motion such as lifting, tugging, throwing, etc. The pain has been persistent for over a month. I am able to do most daily activities with manageable pain, but the pain is persistent and frustrating. There is no noticeable swelling or rash, nothing to visually indicate that there&#39;s pain in the muscle. I scheduled a telehealth visit with my PCP who said that delayed reactions had been documented in some cases with Pfizer but there wasn&#39;t data on J&amp;J yet. She recommended that I monitor my arm, take Tylenol as needed, and keep her updated with any developments. I took Tylenol twice and it didn&#39;t do much. I don&#39;t know anyone else who has had this type of reaction and without data on J&amp;J, I don&#39;t know how long to expect the pain to continue.

                                                Around 3:00pm on 3/7/21 I began to feel a little tired. But 3:45pm I was experiencing muscle pain through my body at only continued to get worse. At 4:30pm I took 400mg of ibuprofen since sitting, walking, and lying down were all painful. Relief came around 5:30pm and I was able to nap for an hour. At 6:30pm I awoke and attempted to eat, as I was beginning to feel nauseous. At 8:30pm I laid down again, my symptoms returning and worsening. I was now experiencing chills with my muscle pain and a headache. Pain was located throughout my body and my skin was sensitive to the touch. At 10:30pm I began shaking violently and struggled to feel warm, despite my skill feeling hot. My temperature was not taken. Another 400mg of ibuprofen was taken and one 350mg chewable of Tums anti-acid was eaten. It was not until 12:30am that I was able to sleep again.  The morning of 3/8/21 I was still fatigued and sore. Moving was difficult and painful and nausea was still present, and my headache returned. I was unable to eat despite trying. At 10:00am I took two tablets of Excedrin Migrain and napped for almost two hours. Currently, my muscle aches are minimal and my headache has improved. This may however be due to the medication.

I have had no complications so far in my pregnancy. On the day after receiving the vaccine, I developed a severe headache, congestion, dehydration, and fatigue. I felt feverish and had chills, but I did not have a fever. I was unable to go about my daily activities (I was not working on this day). These symptoms went away about 36 hours after being vaccinated. I also had pain at the injection site.

Third day - head ache  and muscle fatigue   5th day- starting at 4am. I woke up with skin itching. I noticed a rash on my arm where injection was. It then spread to back, other arm, legs, neck , ankles and knees. Took Benadryl and Zyrtec by doctors orders. The rash went away- but then six hours later returned and has grown. I also have to take more Benadryl since the same amount has not helped the rash disappear.

                                                Yesterday I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I was the last appointment, so they observed me for 5 minutes, and I left. After riding in the car for a few minutes, I noticed that I was having a hard time breathing and my throat felt like it was starting to swell. By that time, the clinic was closed, so I went to the emergency room just in case and sat in my car since they didn&#39;t allow people to sit in the waiting room because if covid.  It started becoming increasingly difficult to breathe, and I was feeling more and more swelling of my throat and tongue. I was having a lot of dizziness, nausea, facial flushing, palpitations, and some mild confusion. I then started getting numbness in the bottom half of my face. Over time, the numbness spread, mostly staying on the left side of my body (face, scalp, lower arms and legs, left side on tongue and inside of mouth). I also started getting a prickling burning pain sensation for brief periods of time where I had numbness. I had decided that if my breathing worsened at all, I would go to the er even though I can&#39;t afford it.   After about an hour and a half, my breathing started to feel less constricted and like there was less resistance. The swelling in my throat was mostly in the upper throat where I had difficulty swallowing but not as much difficulty breathing. The numbness continued to get worse and was sometimes disappearing and reappearing in the same spot.  At 9:30 pm we went to go get some benadryl. I continued feeling less and less swelling and having an easier time breathing. At that point, I went home. Once I was home, my breathing continued to improve and the numbness started to dissipate.  In the middle of the night, I started itching and getting widespread hives and getting a sharp burning pricking pain that would last a few seconds in different areas. The numbness also started coming back mostly in my face. I continued to have difficulty swallowing.  I am feeling much better today. I still feel some slight swelling in my throat when I swallow, but my breathing is fine. I&#39;m still itchy and occasionally breaking out in hives. Im having mild lower facial numbness. I&#39;m also starting to get the normal side effects of fever, headache, arm soreness, and body aches. I&#39;m taking benadryl every 4 hours.

                                                I had general fatigue and headaches. The after I woke up my left arm was red and puffy. Overnight the area had doubled in size, itchy and painful. The area was circular and 2-3 inches in diameter. I went to Urgent care and they gave me Benadryl and a Steroid to take. The area is still painful and swollen and is starting to improve. It has been seven days and the area is still red swollen, warm and itchy. I have three more days of Steroid medication left. I just had a headache and fatigue for the first couple of days.

                                                Received vaccine at approximately 12:30 pm  on 3/15/21 at 13 weeks pregnant (due date of 9/15/21). Weight and height 5&#39;0&#34;, approximates 136lbs.   During injection there was a pain from the needle insert and immediate soreness. I would describe it as more painful than the flu shot that I received in November of 2021. I was then escorted to a chair for a 15 minute observation period. I did not have any allergic reactions to the shot. I continued to feel slight soreness in my left arm for the rest of the day.  At approximately 8 pm I began to feel &#34;aches and pains&#34; similar to those during a cold and flu. I took (1) regular strength Tylenol Acetaminophen 325 mg tablet. I began to feel a little bit warm around 9-10 pm and checked my temperature with an infrared thermometer and it was slightly elevated by a degree (no exact measurement). I  went to bed at approximately 11:30 pm.   At approximately 12:45 am I woke up and took my temperature. I first used the infrared thermometer and it came back as 99.4 F. I felt very warm so I then switched to an Oral thermometer for accuracy and began to record the following: 101.1 F - 12:45am (was under blankets so got out of bed to cool off) / 100.0 F - 1:05 am / 100.9 F - 1:20 am  At 1:10am I used a cold compress (small ice pack wrapped in a kitchen towel) to cool off and then took a luke-warm shower at 1:15 am (did not wet hair). I also drank a big water bottle of water (Tap Water) probably around 500ml. The room temperature was around 74 F. I re-measured my temp at 1:40 am and it decreased to 99.3 F. I took a 2nd Tylenol tablet (same as above) at 2 am. My temperature at 2:05 am was 100.0 F.  I then went in and out of sleep and recorded my temps every time I woke up and went to the bathroom / drank more water. 98.5 F at 3:55 am / 98.4 F at 5:55 am / 99.0 at 7:25 am. At 7:30am I took a 3rd &amp; 4th Tylenol. Temp at 7:55am was 99.4F. I went back to sleep and then woke up at 9am to login remotely for work. Temp at 9:25 am was 98.7.  I then took a nap from 9:30 am to 12:00 pm (my boss told me to go to sleep after our call) and slept very soundly. When I woke up I felt a lot better. Aches and pains were no longer present and fever appeared to be gone. The worst of the symptoms were over. I then spot checked my temp a few times throughout the day: 98.0F at 12:15pm / 98.3 F at 1:40pm / 98.7 at 2:05 pm. At 2:15 pm I took a 5th Tylenol just in case. I took my last official temp at 2:20pm at 98.3 F.   At about 3pm 3/16 I had a telehealth visit with my OBGYN. She said that my symptoms were normal and everything looked ok. My test results from my 12 week sonogram I had 2 weeks prior were all OK as well. To my knowledge the baby is tracking healthy. Note that during the whole time I did not experience any symptoms related to the baby. No cramps or pains in my abdomen. I am happy to share any past or future data about my pregnancy if anyone reading this is interested in contacting me.  I then randomly measured my temp until bed but it never came back as higher than normal (didn?t write it down). Slept through the next night normal and woke up normal temp as well. I would say I was more tired than usual on 3/17 but did not have any more flu like symptoms. The only thing that remained was a soreness at the injection site. It was at the spot of injection and also kind of the general area. The pain/feeling completely went away by the end of the week 3/19.   This is a very long description of symptoms. I don?t know if it?s helpful or if anyone even read all of it. But I?m just writing it down for record.

I woke at 3am with severe chills and shaking. I had a fever of 101.5. I took Tylenol Extra Stength and that helped.  Had trouble sleeping but managed to fall back asleep for a little bit. Upon waking, I had a head, muscle aches, and a fever. I kept taking the Tylonel every 6 hours throughout the entire day. My fever got as high as 102.1. It broke around 7pm on March 18th. My shoulder where the vaccine was injected was sore through Saturday, March 20th. I had muscle aches and weakness through Saturday, March 20th.

Started experiencing fogginess and feeling cold at 1:00 am 20Mar2021. Went to bed at 1:00 and dreamed of being sick until waking up at 8:30 am 20Mar2021. Woke up and was very weak (could not push toothpaste through toothpaste tube), almost passed out in trying, so I sat on the floor. Tried getting back to bed and was extremely nauseous and started vomiting. After that, I had the sweats/fever/chills for a couple hours (until ~11:00am), and was fatigued until 4:00 pm. Spent most of the day sleeping, unable to do anything. Today, 22Mar2021, feel slight tingling on palm of left hand and fingers. Injection site is still sore and bruised

I took 60mg of prednisone and 5mg of levocetirizine the next morning (3/10/21) and the hives subsided until 4pm that night. I went to the Urgent care and received a shot of dexamethasone IM that day as well. I took 40mg of famotidine and 50mg Benadryl that night and woke up the next morning with only a few small patches of hives that went away throughout the day. The next morning (3/11/21)  I took 40mg of famotidine and had a few small patches of hives that went away throughout the day. On 3/12/21 I woke up and had no hives and have not had any symptoms since.

                                                I did get sick that evening - I had a fever and chills. I did throw up. That lasted all night. The fever broke by the morning. But the exhausted next day - I went home from work early that day. Friday, I got a rash  - very itchy and sore  (it felt very tender when touched)- on my left side (abdomen). It spread around the left side on my back and to my stomach. I say my doctor on this Tuesday (virtual appt) said it was Shingles - Valtrex - to help it heal faster. The rash is starting to scab over and is peeling now.  It&#39;s getting better.

                                                Starting around 8 pm began experiencing fatigue, Chills, and nausea. By 10 pm began having headache and went to lay down. Woke up in middle of the night with high fever, cold sweats, and migraine. By morning migraine intensified, could not stand for more than a few minutes without feeling faint and waves of nausea, complete loss of appetite and felt extremely dehydrated and lethargic. Sore arm at injection site started second day and progressively got worse day 3 and 4. 36 hours after vaccine was when I felt more able to eat, walk around, migraine reduced to a dull headache. Fatigue lingered in day to day activities for about 1 week.

My ears were slightly swollen and very red and itchy. At this point I took a good dose of benadryl . Before the benadryl kicked in, it had spread down my back, arms, and stomach. After the medicine had time to work my symptoms started going away and I was fine.

                                                I found out about my pregnancy the day I got the vaccine (which was after I got the vaccine). After that I proceeded to get a pregnancy test confirmation  (march 26) and it came back positive from the doctors office. On March 28 I began to have bleeding and I passed a blood clot the size of a baseball.  I called the nurse line that next day and they told me they could not give me any medical advice because I had not been seen by a doctor for this pregnancy.  During that week I began to experience a rash that began in the middle of my chest and proceeded to spread All over my stomach and back. It is now April 19 in the rash has continue to spread all over my limbs. On April 5 I went to the pregnancy clinic and was also getting a ultrasound and they were unable to locate the embryo in the uterus. On April 15 I got an ultrasound transvaginal and they were unable to locate an embryo or in a heartbeat. I then went to the hospital the next day on April 16 the hospital that I received my vaccine at and they did not give me any care and told me that my rash was a possible contact to something I may have come in contact recently. I try to express to the doctor that I?ve been experiencing issues since I received the vaccine and he did not connect any of the dots to my experiences.  As of today April 19 I have come across several Different websites that state that red spot is a part of the symptoms an adverse reaction to the vaccine or should be of concern.

Vision slightly obscured, but I could still see. Applied a cold compress throughout the day and monitored for additional concerns. By the end of the day, the swelling subsided. By Monday, both eyes still felt pressure pain, but the swelling was significantly improved. Other side effects included the expected muscle soreness/aches, fatigue, and a mild rash around the vaccination spot. No additional adverse effects observed.

                                                Injection was very painful and felt immediately as if it was improperly administered causing my arm to go limp (so to speak)  right away. The pain was so intense that I became extremely lightheaded almost to the point of fainting. Within 15 minutes following the vaccination, I started experiencing excruciating arm pain at the injection site . The pain has persisted for the past month with little to no relief, I now have limited range of motion and cannot make certain movements with my arm.

                                                Patient experienced sudden dizziness and nausea within 5 minutes of receiving Janssen COVID-19 immunization. Gave her water, crackers and cold/wet rags for her forehead as she felt hot. Took her temperature, returned normal. Gave her a trash can to keep near. Kept an eye on the patient and realized she was getting red in the face and more dizzy than she had been. Went out and stood next to patient, with her mom on her other side. Began to experience light sensitivity, feeling like the room was spinning. Patient almost fell out of the chair while sitting still. Mom used a personal pulse oximeter on patient, all results normal. Asked the patient about other symptoms, such as chest/abdominal/leg pain, headache, shortness of breath. Patient reported a headache, dizziness, nausea and leg numbness roughly 30 minutes following the vaccine. I recommended going to the ER, mom believed it would pass with time, but insisted she never responds this way to immunizations. Patient began to experience stabbing chest and abdominal pain around 45 minutes. Patient&#39;s mom was still hesitant to take her to the ER immediately on her own and asked us to call her PCP. He wanted the patient to go to the ER. Patient believed she would fall if she stood, offered to get a motorized cart, wheelchair or call an ambulance to transport her. Both patient and mom requested the ambulance. Asked a technician to check patient medications and allergies for EMTs, retook the patient&#39;s temperature which was normal again. Stayed with patient until EMTs arrived, reported all symptoms patient was experiencing.

The only thing different in my body was the Janssen Vaccine. Midway through my IV I started itching, numbness in my fingers, lips, and feet. My face was on fire and my tongue was swelling and I could feel my throat closing. My arms turned red and blotchy and swelled. My nurse stopped the Benlysta and started Benadryl and a saline flush. The symptoms then went away.

These symptoms carried through to the next day (4/9/21).  When I woke up at 6:00 am on 4/10/21 I had a rash on the backs of my upper arms and the front of my thighs.  As the day went on, the rash progressed to cover my entire body.  I went to the ER around 2 pm where I received a steroid injection and was prescribed oral steroids.  I was fatigued for the next two days, but was able to return to work on 4/12/21.  The rash began subsiding, but overall lasted 2-3 weeks.    I completed my seven day prescription of oral steroids on 4/17/21.  On 4/18/21 I was very fatigued.  On 4/19/21 and 4/20/21 I was extremely fatigued and unable to get out of bed, sit up, or stand up.  On 4/23/21 I woke up at 7:00 am with a swollen face, throat, tongue and lips.  I returned to the ER where they prescribed me another round of steroids, but a lower dose and a longer duration.  I experienced fatigue for 6 weeks after receiving the vaccine.

                                                Right eye lid swelled up within 24 hours of the shot and is still an issue as of this submission.  Some days the swelling has been severe some days and less severe, but the swelling has never fully gone away in the last two months. The swelling can include the eyelid, the skin between the lid and the brow, and below the eye . The eyelid and skin near brow will often turn pink/purple. Beyond the swelling pain, no major main. Some pain on outer eye bone for both eyes.  The swelling seems to get worse when I  sleep longer or lay down horizontal.  When I go to sleep propped up, the swelling is less severe. Or, if I sleep for 7 or less hours, sometimes the swelling can be less.

                                                I received the vaccine at 9am on Saturday, March 6th. My arm was immediately very sore throughout the day. Around 9:30pm that night I began to feel nauseous. As the night progressed my symptoms got worse. I experienced intense chills and by 11pm had a 100 degree fever. Sunday, March 7th my fever had decreased, but I continued to feel nauseous and have chills throughout the day. Additionally I felt extremely fatigued, weak, and had a throbbing headache. Completing simple tasks were difficult and exhausting. Monday, March 8th I continue to experience significant fatigue, headache, and muscle weakness, but at less intensity. Also, my right arm where I received the injection is very sore. I have also been somewhat dizzy today. I have been taking Advil, drinking fluids, using an ice pack, and resting as much as I can as part of the treatment.

My fever peaked at about midnight with a temperature of 101.8. At that point, I took two Tylenol. Had a rough night and didn&#39;t sleep well. Continued taking Tylenol the following day to manage the low grade fever. I seem to back mostly back to normal today (two days after receiving the vaccine), however I do still have soreness in my left arm where I got the shot and some residual aches and pains.

                                                Within about 30 minutes of the shot I started to get the chills, feel nauseous, hard to focus, and very lethargic. Injection site was hot to the touch and did swell a bit. The following day I went through strong waves of feeling very ill and then feeling ok for about an hour, then back to having chills, nauseous, headache, body ache, and extremely lethargic. Half way through second day I broke out in a rash all over my chest, tummy, and back. Entering into day 3 ( today ) I do feel better, but can&#39;t shake the brain fog and feelings of being tired. Rash is still present currently.

                                                4/8/21:  I receive the injection at 1:50pm on my left arm.  8pm: I begin experiencing normal side effects: soreness, body aches, and headache.  9pm: In addition to the soreness, body aches, and headache, I start having chills, which last on and off throughout the night. 4/9/21:  7am: I feel fatigued, with headache and body aches throughout the morning and afternoon. 3pm: I begin to have some itchiness on my forehead and both ears. My right knee cap feels hot and bruised, but there is no mark. 5pm: Visible hives appear on my forehead and right knee cap, and my ears are red. All of these spots are very itchy and uncomfortable.  9pm: The hives begin to be much more noticeable and itchier. I take one Benadryl before going to bed which helps the itchiness somewhat. 4/10/21  3:30am: I am woken up by pain in my ears and they have gotten incredible swollen, red, and hot. They are very tender to the touch. I take another tablet of Benadryl.  7am: There are more hives on my forehead and cheeks, as well as my knee and now on two of my fingers. A few spots also appear on my feet and on one toe. My ears are less swollen but still not back to normal, and they are still red, hot and tender.  9am: I have a video call with a Physician?s Assistant who determines it is most likely not an anaphylactic reaction (no swelling in my throat or eyes or any of the other red flag symptoms. I also take my blood pressure with a home monitor and it is normal). He prescribes me a steroid pack.  12pm: The hives begin to be less and less itchy and red.  8pm: The hives are almost completely gone, save for a few spots on my feet. As I am breastfeeding my 14-month-old daughter, I had waited to begin the steroid pack until after our last nursing session of the day (around 7:30pm). As the hives seemed to be going away on their own, I decide to not take the medication. I do take one dose of Zyrtec. 4/11/21:  7am: the hives are completely gone

That same night I began having a horrible headache, and my muscles and joints began aching and hurting. It felt like I was holding a two ton rock over my head when I would try to walk. I took Benadryl and used Sarna lotion for the itching, and took tylenol for the headache and muscle aches. IF symptoms don&#39;t subside, then I will visit the clinic at my job to be treated and see what they could recommend.

                                                I received the J&amp;J one-dose vaccine on Thursday, April 8, at approx. 1600. Within an hour I had a mild headache and was nauseous. I went to sleep around 2130. At 0030 (or 30 minutes past midnight) I was awoken to the sudden shock of feeling very cold. My temperature was 91, within 15 minutes I spiked to 100 degrees, and then 15 minutes later I was at 102. I was shivering but felt like I was on fire. I had intense pain throughout my entire body. Internally and topically (skin) my entire body felt like it was on fire -- a burning sensation. Clothes -- even a soft hoodie -- felt like a steel wool scrubber was brushing against my skin and my skin was very hot to touch. I continued to feel nauseous.  After 90 minutes of this, I was able to take acetaminophen (2 x 500 mg). After another 90 minutes, my temperature dipped to 99 and the horrible pain mostly subsided.   From 0530 to 1830, in three-hour increments, my temperature continued to spike and fall between 99-101 degrees and the pain came in the same waves. Nausea continued. So, I continued an acetaminophen regimen throughout the day to help with the symptoms and took a few tums to help too.  After 1830, I felt very weak and tired. My temperature stabilized at normal. Nausea continued.   On Saturday, April 10, I was mostly just tired and had minor body aches/soreness. My shoulder bruised where I was vaccinated. Food did not sit well and my stomach was quick to turn.   Sunday, April 11, mostly back to normal. Although, still fatigued. No major side effects or symptoms.   Monday, April 12, seems to be the same as Sunday.   Note: I had COVID the first week of February 2021.

                                                I received the vaccination 4/2/21 at 11am and at about 6pm the same day - I felt a sudden flush and felt like I was going to faint in the middle of Grocery store. Got very clammy and sweaty and weak - immediately left the store and started projectile vomiting outside the store and all night the first night. Had extremely joint/bone pain throughout my entire body for 4 days straight in bed, very weak, chills and night sweats, day 2 I had a little energy and drove about an hour and immediately started vomiting again  for day 2-day 5. Day 5 I woke up with swollen eye lids and hands and thought it was an allergic reaction to something in my house so took benedryl, but didn?t help. The swelling went down on day 6. I?ve had no energy and very foggy brain and been very down. My chest has felt like an anxiety attack 24/7 all week. I am on day 10 since the vaccination and my chest pain has increased. I still have foggy brain and been very out of it and weak still. I vomited day 1-day 5. Really bad pain in my hips and arm where I received the shot.

                                                I had the normal flu like symptoms about six hours after the vaccine on 4/01/21. They subsided the next morning 4/02. On Saturday night 4/03, I developed a rash on the creases of my arms. I woke up on Sunday 4/04 itching like crazy on my legs. The rash moved around my body throughout the week: back, torso, legs, arms. Everywhere except for my face and feet. It seemed to be hives, as I would have the urge to itch and then the rash would flare up. This went on from 4/03 to about Friday 4/09 and then it subsided. I was advised by a GP to take Zyrtec twice a day and could use a topical steroid until the rash subsided and to avoid an oral steroid. I have had a handful of rashes throughout my adult life so I could tell this one did not look very serious. Like the standard rash, I was so itchy at night. It felt like my skin was crawling.  I suspect it was my body&#39;s delayed reaction to the vaccine shot.

                                                Approximately 1 day after receiving the vaccine my arm was sore and red at the injection site.  My arm continued to have red discoloration and soreness for about a week after injection.  One the redness went down the injection site was hard and continues to feel as though there is a marble under my skin.  It&#39;s about the size of a Nickle and now bruised.    This might be normal but wanted to report it in the event that it&#39;s not.

                                                4/10/21 Patient presented to Urgent Care with Arm Pain (left arm painful and tingly since COVID shot 4/8; now pain is different and there is a lump on her forearm she can feel).  4/13/21 Contacted the office to schedule an appointment regarding worsening symptoms.  Scheduled appointment.   4/14/21 cont. Seen in office by PA for: 1. Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses. - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT; Future   2. Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3. Family history of DVT - see #1 4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.  (Per provider result notes.)  4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.  Following the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.     She has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.  No abdominal pain.  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.   Patient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.  Advised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.    4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine. An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE. She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days. She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot. She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago. The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.   Today, patient presents states he feels &#34;a lot better&#34;. Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved. She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter; she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this. She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.    She was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75. Today her blood pressure is 122/78.   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved; she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds. She denies pain or swelling of the arm. She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone. She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla. She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.    Her mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved. She denies worsening or severe headache; denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.   Phone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr. After review of patient&#39;s history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily. They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week. They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.   I did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice. They had just left this morning for another state by car. I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not. She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended.

And I was not able to do anything the next day and that was the 11th. I l also got my period that day. The 12th, my period became a geyser - I never had a period like that before - I was bleeding a lot for about 5 days (my period didn&#39;t last longer than  a normal  period though) ; and I still had some muscle aches (they continued through the 12th). So I gave my PCP a call and went in, and she told me to watch it (she didn&#39;t know I had been vaccinated. I&#39;ve had an ongoing headache this week: on Wednesday (the 21st) - for 22 hours non-stop and Thursday (the 22nd I had another one on Thursday - it was about 6 or 7 hours).

                                                patient was treated with the Janssen/Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 adenovirus vaccine on Saturday April 10, 2021 and she relates having had symptomatic problems since that time stating prior to administration of the vaccine she was in her normal state of health.  She relates that on the evening of April 10 she had chills but otherwise no other major symptoms and the next day felt fine as well as during that week.  However she states that starting 1 week later on Saturday, April 17 she began feeling poorly characterized by a recurrence of hives that she has had in the past along with a sore throat.  She states this occurred while she was at work and describes the sore throat as unusual from prior sore throat she has had in the past with a description of a globus-like sensation along with some difficulties swallowing for more pressure than overt pain.  She attempted salt water gargles without benefit.  The rash was the characteristic hives rash that she has had on 2 prior occasions with rapid development of itchy red lesions scattered throughout especially in her proximal extremities and torso region.  She relates the hives worsened on Sunday, April 18 essentially from &#34;head to toe&#34; although not actually involving her face.  She also related new accompanying symptoms including diffuse arthralgias, stiffness and swollen painful muscles and joints.  This was throughout her entire body and somewhat of a migratory nature involving all of her major joints including the hands, wrists, shoulders, feet, ankles, knees and hips.  She states that because of the severity of symptoms she had an urgent care appointment on Sunday, April 18 and felt to have a exacerbation of urticaria for which she was prescribed montelukast, loratadine cimetidine and a Solu-Medrol Dosepak.  She states she was unable to fill the Solu-Medrol Dosepak initially but took the other medications without relief and then presented to the emergency room here at Hospital on Monday, April 19 where she had an evaluation which was largely unremarkable other than laboratory testing with a nonspecific elevation in inflammatory markers including a CRP of 5.7, ESR 34 and white blood count 15.92.  She was notably COVID-19 negative at that time as well as Monospot negative.  She was discharged home and ended up filling the Solu-Medrol Dosepak which she took and noted some improvement in her hives but has been continue to experience this ongoing sore throat, arthralgias, myalgias and diffuse swelling which is quite painful.  She specifically relates &#34;every time I use a muscle it seems to inflame.&#34;

                                                patient admitted 4/23 for a multitude of symptoms and signs suggestive of a multisystem autoimmune inflammatory disorder of unclear etiology. Her past medical history is relevant for mild intermittent asthma, history of recurrent idiopathic urticaria, history of migraine headaches, hypothyroidism on supplemental levothyroxine, history of bipolar affective disorder on antipsychotropic medications (lamotrigine) and ADHD on stimulant medication (Focalin).  Notably, the patient received a Johnson and Johnson COVID19 vaccine on 4/10. She reports current symptom onset on 4/17. Symptoms include pleuritic type chest pain, myalgias, arthralgias, diffuse interstitial edema, urticaria and objectively evidence of diffuse inflammation manifested by rising leukocytosis 16,000, CRP 9.3 from 5.7 just days ago, ESR 71 from 34 just several days ago, and new acute hepatitis. Pt admitted to the hospital and hospitalist states &#34;Unclear etiology definitively but the clinical features all developed approximately 1 week after administration of the Janssen/Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 adenovirus vaccine which raises suspicion for this vaccine setting off the disease process&#34; and &#34;Strongly recommend consideration for reporting of possible adverse reaction to the Johnson Johnson vaccine&#34;.

However, starting 04/28/21 patient began experiencing full body itching. The only recent change was immunization. Patient is unsure if vaccination is the cause of the itching but wanted to report just in case. Patient is without a primary care provider currently and went to an urgent care center after a sleepless night 04/30/21 due to itching. The urgent care prescribed something for the itching but patient didn&#39;t feel she was taken seriously with concerns about vaccination. Patient will try to follow up with previous primary care provider in the future.

It&#39;s tiny now - I can still feel it but for the most part it&#39;s down to just a little lump. Went to   Urgent Care - about two weeks after the vaccine. Topical ointment was given to me and was told to take Benadryl. I took it for two days and then went to see the other doctor and he said that the ointment wouldn&#39;t do anything and it hadn&#39;t so I stopped taking the Benadryl and using the ointment.

Over the next few days they continued to weep. They stopped weeping and were crusty, and then the crust came off on the Wednesday after it began. My lips were still sore and sensitive, but were back to normal about 10 days later. Doctor prescribed an antiviral (vircyclovir) for cold sore but I don&#39;t think it was a cold sore. I actually did develop a cold sore on my bottom lip 2 weeks after the initial lip issue.

On Tuesday (May 18th), my legs, buttocks, and arms broke out into a severe rash. Large welts, extremely itchy, and spreading quickly. I went to my doctor the same day to receive treatment after trying topical antihistamine cream and witch hazel, which provided little to no relief.

Two weeks after shot I noticed a lot of bruising on arms and legs and started to get red/pink skin patches/rashes on my body.

                                                Around 7 pm on the night the vaccine was administered (5/14/21), I noticed my legs felt heavier and weird. When I looked at my legs, they were swollen and slightly red. This did concern me, but given that I can not afford health insurance, I laid in bed with my legs elevated and eventually went to sleep. When I woke up the next day around 9 am, my legs were no longer swollen, but my hands now were. The swelling went away by 5 pm that day(5/15/2021). Thus far, besides a headache that persisted for three days straight from 5/21/21 until 5/24/21, I haven?t experienced any other abnormal swelling and I currently feel fine today.

It is very similar to the &#34;COVID Arm&#34; hypersensitivity effects seen with the Moderna vaccine.

                                                Within 10 hours of getting the Janssen covid vaccine, I had suddent and severe joint pain in multiple joints, severe body chills, fatigue. I was shivering and felt unable to get warm despite truck temperature at 90 degrees along with a blanket and seat warmers on. Took 1000mg of Tylenol and symptoms mostly resolved with some minor joint pain and fatigue but had to continue the tylenol every 8-10 hours for the next 2 days or the symptoms returned in the severe state. Site of injection has also been swore with touch still at day 9. No redness or swelling at injection site. Also had 2xepisodes of random severe fatigue which is not normal and it lasted about 1-2 hours.

I washed my hands added lotion to them and went back to bed. I was okay when I woke up in the morning.

                                                Nothing right away other than some tenderness at the injection site. Later that evening (about 11-12 hours later) I became very tired. Was able to sleep until about 3:00 a.m., at which point I woke up to changing temperatures from hot to cold, headache and muscle aches. Most of the aching is occurring in my legs and arms. The back of my thighs are the worst, then my valga, and lastly my biceps and triceps. The headache is mild.

Shortly afterwards I developed a warm red bump about the size of a lime (which is still there today). My mother, brother and myself all developed backaches and headaches the next day, but those have passed.   I still have pain at the injection site whenever it is touched.  I called the health department two days after the vaccination and was told that the side effects should only last 24-48 hours, but I still have the redness, lump and soreness.

                                                I got the vaccine, then was asked (due to having previous allergic reaction to Levaquin in the past, I was asked to wait 30 minutes) I got up and walked a total of 30 feet to sit in a chair. I felt completely normal, up until this point. I sat down and began to text my Mother that I had just got the vaccine &amp; I was told to wait 30 minutes, at this point (2 mins in) I felt normal. I sat my phone down on my lap and was just looking about. I began at that point (2 1/2-3 mins mark) seeing the tile floor morph; the blue tiles and the green tiles kept merging together and forming one color. Then my heart raced, immediately and I started having hot flashes that shot out my ears. My heart raced even more and at that point I had realized something wasn?t right. A National Guards member came up to me and had asked if I were okay, I explained I was not and something was not right. They took me to a medical area and made me take deep breaths, and made me drink some water. My BP was high, and my Pulse Ox had dropped slightly, and then went straight back to normal once they had asked me to stick my head between my knees and keep breathing deeply. Also, both of my ears had turned deep red/purple and they were VERY warm to the touch. They felt as if heat were tunneling out of them. The only way I can explain truly how I felt, and I have NEVER done it fully, I felt as if I was fainting. Out of nowhere I felt as if I was going to pass out ? but it didn?t happen. The entire ?spell? lasted about 20 mins? I was monitored for an additional 40 minutes and was allowed to leave.

Felt a little nauseous immediately after shot. Flu symptoms came on around 10pm and lasted until about 5pm on 3/21/2021. Worst period of symptoms was overnight (about 12 hours.) Took 2 Tylenol 2-3 times while I was experiencing side effects which helped some with symptoms.  Had pain with injection and sore arm for about 48 hours after. It was a much more severe, deeper muscle pain than with other vaccines.

                                                Fatigue that increased, muscle and body aches, starting at the vaccine site then radiating through my shoulder and back, fever, chills, and severe body aches around 11 hours after receiving the vaccine. I took ibuprofen, which didn?t have much effect, followed by Tylenol 3, which relieved the pain enough that I fell asleep. By morning (7am) the fever had dispersed along with the other symptoms apart from soreness around the injection site.

Muscle aches and stiffness in neck - lasted about two days.  Nausea - was mostly on the second day after shot when I noticed it the most.

The injection site of the vaccine was hot to the touch.  I have a history with severe food and medical reactions and know what my body feels like when it is about to go into anaphyisis so I immediately took 3 Benadryl.  During this time my body tempature rose from 97.8 to 98.6.  After an hour, the symptoms passed.

My body felt very hot but I was still cold. Went to bed without taking any pain relief. I woke up at 2 AM, took Tylenol and went back to sleep. I woke up again at 3 AM, felt very hot and turned on my fan. When I woke up in the morning at 7:30 AM, my body still aches and I still had a headache. I took more Tylenol. Headache went away but for the rest of the day I felt very lethargic, a little foggy in my brain, slightly achy. I took Tylenol again when I went to bed at 9 PM and when I woke up at 4 AM the next morning I felt better. All symptoms are gone.

She went to Dr. to have a physical since she was feeling so bad.  They did blood work and everything came out fine.  She is going back to the doctor to show them the rash since she forgot to show him when she was there to get her physical.  She is applying alcohol rub which seems to be helping.  All of her symptoms have subsided excluding her rash.

                                                Within a couple minutes of receiving vaccine I became very sweaty, dizzy, increased heart rate. Medic had me lay down with feet elevated, cold compress. I felt ok enough to drive home after 30 mins. The next day I woke up very sick, like I had the flu. Sweating, chills, extremely achy, upset stomach, diarrhea, pain at injection site and numbness:tingling in left arm all the way down to pinky finger. Next day I woke up with a bright red rash all around base of neck. Next day woke up a lot better.

                                                the first 2 days had the expected fever, body aches.  Day 3 and onward started experiencing new and building symptoms as each day progressed.  Headache for 3 days (above right eye, caused some vision changes), then sore throat, cough, brain fog, difficulty sleeping, along with body aches continuing.  Currently on day 13 and still have sore throat, coughing, brain fog, difficulty sleeping, muscle aches, congestion.  Also on day 3, eczema has been building on my face/neck.  Eczema has continued to get worse each day.  when I got the shot, I communicated to the nurse, I was maybe pregnant.  it was too soon to test.  That was Friday.  I had a positive pregnancy test the following Tuesday.  I&#39;ve since taken 2 more tests that were positive and have missed my period.  So safe to say i&#39;m pregnant.

The headache was so severe I felt if you drilled a hole in the top of my head air would spew out.  Additionally, on 04/10/21 I had soreness in the injection site, some pain in the right shoulder blade which felt like an inflamed bursa, some fatigue,&#43; dehydration (cotton mouth-dry tongue). After 04/10/21-todayI have had mild headaches occasionally during the week. I had started to have a mild cough since 04/22/21.

I finally went to the doctor and they has me taking  2400 mg of prescription ibuprofen and on flexeril muscle relaxers for 2 weeks to see if I get any relief.

                                                Became very tired, took a 3 hour nap starting roughly at 6pm. Woke up around 9:30pm with flu like symptoms, lethargic and didn&#39;t feel like I was able to move, but was not comfortable laying in bed. Got chilly shortly after waking up around 9:30 pm. Was able to feel warm with a hoodie, sweatpants, thick socks, and a blanket on.  Was not hungry but felt like eating was not a good idea. I didn&#39;t feel like I had the energy to eat. I was drinking water as I felt it was necessary. I went back to bed around 11:30pm and woke up the next morning feeling fine. My arm was sore for 2 days, afterwards, ached near the injection site, and when I used the upper arm muscles to move my arm. I&#39;m not sure after that because I was taking ibuprofen and Tylenol for cramps.

                                                That next Tuesday, I felt a swelling in right armpit, I went to the urgent care. It was warm and swollen and looked like the start of the infection. They prescribed sulfameth/trimethoprim 800/160mg 2x a day which didn&#39;t help anything and I went back 2 days later. The abscess had swollen to golf ball size. I also had swelling at injection site, hot, red, &amp; painful. Doxycycline 100mg. That started helping but the arm was still painful. Hidradenitis suppurativa was the diagnosis. Dermatologist says that it was caused by a autoimmune response. Armpit was injected with a steriod/lidacaine injection. I had to have wound treatment. Clindamycin lotion, 1% to help would site clean. The issue was the injection site area that took 2 weeks to resolve. It was hard, red, raised and hot. They were not sure if it was an allergy or infection. I also felt like I was in a brain fog during this.

                                                The day within 10 minutes I started feeling hot and feverish. Then I started to feel lumping and cramping in my left breast and it persists and it turned in to nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. I also felt body cramping and both of breasts became extremely hard and was not comfortable. I also had muscle aches along with a mild fever for about a week. The pain was persistent. Then on day 2, the headaches started and I couldn&#39;t sleep because every time I moved the headache would cause me to vomit. So, I couldn&#39;t. My vision was blurry and I was not sure if it was due to the headache or the vaccine. I ended up going to the ER on 05/16/2021  for cramping in my left leg which was down by my ankle and was bruised. I&#39;m still experiencing heart palpitations, tiredness, cramps still happen in my breasts,  and there are still moments when my vision goes in and out.

                                                I went to the ER on 05/14/2021 because I had swelling in one ankle. I am pregnant so I was concerned. I was tested and a Deep Vein Thrombosis in my right leg. The swelling was in my left leg. There is no redness or swelling in that leg. I am taking subcutaneous injection of Lovenox 0.8 ml twice daily.  I was 27 weeks pregnant at the time.  I am currently experiencing injection site pain and I am seeing a maternal Fetal Medicine Specialist monthly. A birth plan has to made for when I deliver because of the medication.  The diagnosis states Right Popliteal and Proximal  calf DVT.  Due-Date-08-09-2021 Pregnancy-First Pregnancy

The injection site is extremely tender and hurts to lift my arm. As of 11 am the next day I have also added diarrhea to the list of symptoms.

                                                Approximately 7.5 hours after the vaccine I woke up with severe/violent chills/shakes. Fever unknown. I sat in a hot bath for about an hour and they stopped. When I got out I took ibprophen and went back to bed. Soon they started again and I piled on a weighted blanket to get them to calm down and eventually fell asleep. I also had a lot of head heaviness and pressure during this time. The next morning I woke up with body aches from all the tensing up and felt week and still had head pressure. By midday I was back to normal. Still some injection site soreness and swelling her today, Monday 3/15.

                                                I began to have a small headache about 4 hours after the shot which turned into a bigger full body aches, and tiredness 8 hours after injection. Chills started approximately 10 hrs after injection and lasted for at least 4 hours, followed by sweats which lasted at least another 6 hours. Aches were very painful for ten hours and I took extra strength tylenol twice over the ten hour period. Aches and exhaustion continued, though less painful, for the next  12-18 hours. and were gone after about 36 hours total.  Shoulder at injection site did not hurt initially, but began to hurt about 10 hrs after, and continued to get worse for about 10 hours until finally dissapating in that spot 48 hrs later.  However, the pain at the injection site has moved to the shoulder joint, and adjacent clavical area over the next day or so where it has stayed now 5 days after injection.

                                                I received the vaccine on Friday afternoon at 4 and woke up on Friday night being extremely nauseous followed by chills and sweats. Saturday I felt achy and a little unsteady when I got up or walked around (these reactions I expected). Sunday morning I woke up covered head to toe in hives that lasted for three days. I have never had hives so bad before. I called the pharmacy and was instructed to take Benedryl which didn&#39;t work. I took Allegra on Tuesday which seemed to help clear them up by the end of the day.

                                                I had the usual symptoms of a vaccine reaction like extreme muscle pain in my upper back/neck, chills, and fatigue.  But then on Monday I noticed a very tender left armpit, and I also have very itchy eyes, something I never have.  I also developed a small purple patch on my leg, and a little skin sore on my left arm.  It looks like more may be developing.

                                                Received vaccine at noon. Injection site pain was manageable. Started to feel tired around 4pm and took 500mg Tylenol. Took an Epsom salt bath at 6:30pm. At 8pm got hit with chills, fever of 100F, entire neck and back started to ache and have pain, mild headache, and both hands and fingers felt weak and had a burning sensation. Took another 500mg Tylenol then laid down and fell asleep around 9pm. Woke up at 11pm drenched in sweat with same symptoms. Changed into dry clothes and woke up again around 3am drenched in sweat again, but fever was gone. Woke up on April 9 feeling lethargic, a tire body was achy and sore and had a headache. Fever never came back and the weakness and burnings ends ruin in hands was gone as were the chills. Throughout the day I rested and had physical therapy to loosen my muscles in my neck and back. By the end of the day I still had a headache and sore back and neck. Woke up on Sunday april 10 and back achy ness is tolerable, headache is still present, but manageable. Took 600 mg Advil in morning.

She experienced extreme soreness, swelling, hardness, and redness at injection site.  Patient went to doctor and they gave her antibiotics however I don&#39;t think there was any infection, it just sounds like an injection site reaction.

                                                On Thursday, April 8, 2021, between 915 and 945 AM, I received the Janssen/Johnson &amp; Johnson single dose COVID-19 Vaccine. As I have had adverse reactions to vaccines in the past, I was advised to wait at the vaccination site for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, and I did. Approximately 2 hours after receiving the vaccine in my left arm, I developed a red lacey-type rash all over my body. (This rash still persists today, Tuesday, April 13, 2021 at 3:37 PM and is relieved temporarily with consistent doses of Benadryl capsules, liquid or tablets.)  On Thursday night (April 8), after receiving the vaccine, I began to have body aches and to feel fatigued around 7:30 PM. I took 50 mg Benadryl, 500 mg acetaminophen, 800mg ibuprofen and went to bed. I woke around 12:30 AM and was drenched in sweat and my clothes were wet with sweat. I urinated and went back to bed and was shivering uncontrollably from the time I got out of bed until I got back in the bed and bundled up?it was several minutes before the shivering stopped and I went back to sleep. At approximately 2 AM, I woke up to urinate again. I had a terrible headache, like my head was in a vice; my tongue, throat, and nasal passages were very swollen, and it was difficult to breathe through my nose at all. I took an additional 50 mg of Benadryl and a 500mg acetaminophen and went back to bed. On Friday morning I woke to a phone call from work checking on me. I had slept through all of my alarms and it was 8:35 AM. I was unable to report to work that day and went back to sleep and slept for most of the day, only getting up occasionally to get a drink and use the bathroom. That evening I was able to get up and do a few things with the children and run to the grocery store, however, I became very fatigued and went to bed early without eating dinner.  On Saturday morning, when I woke up, I realized that I had slept for over 12 hours. I was groggy and fatigued all day and had a nap in the afternoon. That evening I was able to participate in family movie night and was feeling ok until about 10 PM. At that time, I began to feel very nauseated and had diarrhea, even though I had not eaten anything that would upset my stomach. I had intense abdominal cramping and felt like I would vomit if I moved around too much. I went to bed and had to get up to use the bathroom with diarrhea at least twice after the initial symptoms at about 10 PM.  On Sunday morning, I woke up after sleeping approximately 10 hours and was able to get up without feeling too fatigued. I did chores and errands and began to feel fatigued in the afternoon and took a nap for about 2 hours. That evening I also had to rush to the bathroom with diarrhea, however, there was no nausea. I went to bed at about 10 PM. On Monday morning, when I woke up, I felt very groggy and did not feel like I had gotten enough sleep. By the evening on Monday, however, I had begun to feel a little less fatigued and more clear-headed. As of Tuesday, April 13, 2021, I have had the red lacey-looking rash intermittently since having the vaccine. I am already on several OTC allergy medications for seasonal allergies and continue to take those medications, however, I have increased my Benadryl intake from 25 mg in the morning to 50 mg in the mornings with 25 -50 mg every 6 hours or so, as well. The rash improves for a short time while I am taking the Benadryl, but it reappears within a few hours after taking the Benadryl.

                                                A few minutes after the injection I felt strange sensations in my arms. About half an hour after the injection started feeling a little dizzy and tightness in chest and throat. Later in the evening I had mild flu like symptoms, chills aches. The following morning was a Sunday and was feeling better but later that day throat started hurting. Throat progressively became swelled and irritated and extremely sore. Flu like symptoms returned. Throat was swelled and to the peak of pain on Monday night. Tuesday morning I was seen at a clinic and it was a little bit better. It started getting better after that but also it has now been a week and a half and throat is still a little bit irritated. I also have brown splotches that appeared on my face either the night of the vaccine or the morning that have not went away.

                                                I got the vaccine at 4pm at the pharmacy where I work. I had no symptoms except for very mild local injection discomfort but was able to do my usual normal activities. At 2 am that evening, I woke up with  a lot of pain in my legs, I felt they were so heavy to move around in bed. My lower back was extremely painful too, I tried to stand up to walk a bit, the pain was very severe and I couldn?t stand straight, it was very hard to drag my feet, they felt very heavy and my muscled were painful to the touch even. So went back to bed, and was in agony. I had to go to work in the morning to open the store I work at until they find me coverage. Driving was very hard with my painful legs. J reached the store and I was walking very slowly, I couldn?t have a full control over my legs, they were painful waist down, and felt very heavy, when I sat down my muscles were painful wherever pressure was applied to them (from the chair).  Lightheadedness: I felt lightheaded when I woke up from bed at night to try to walk and ease the pain. So decided to go back to bed to prevent falls. At work, while walking and sitting, I had episodes of very light headidness and sat often on the floor and lifted my legs. Measured my blood pressure on 3 occasions it was 90/50  then 100/50 then 110/60. One time only I fainted where my colleagues put me down and lifted my legs.  At 8am (morning of 3/9/20201) I had a feeling of  heavy breathing. Needed to take deep breath as if my lung muscles were tired and needed to take deep breath to fill them with enough air. At work and because of the increased intensity of muscles pain, I started to breath faster and deeper coz I was in agony   Headache: severe and excruciating headache started from 6am to 12pm on 3/9/21.   Throughout the symptoms, I refused to take medications to let the vaccine run its course. My family drove me back from work coz I was weak and lightheaded and in severe pain at 10.30am. Came home, took one Advil 200mg at 11am. I was completely pain free  at 12pm. Lungs still felt weak, needed to breath deeper for two days but then got better.

                                                On March 13th, 2021 I was given the opportunity to receive the Janssen Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid 19 vaccine so I decided to go ahead and get vaccinated.  Within 1.5 hours of receiving the vaccine, I began to feel unwell. It started with my left leg going numb. From there symptoms continued to increase. I got very tired could hardly stay awake. Then the chills hit. I could not get warm.  By the next morning (Sunday day 2) I had developed a low fever, headache, body aches and whole body weakness. I could still hardly stay awake still. When I was awake, I was very dizzy and I felt like everything around me was moving but I was not. My left leg still felt numb but I thought it would pass on its own.. Because of how I felt, I just laid around and rested. My injection site was swollen, Red and extremely hot to touch.  Next comes Monday (day 3), I got up that morning, still not feeling well. I made my way to work. That did not go well. The more I moved, the worse I felt. I was completely unbalanced and looked like I was drunk. I couldn&#39;t walk straight, I had to randomly grab onto chairs and sit down. I was feeling weaker by the minute. I left work at that point and went to see my primary physician that afternoon. At this point I could see straight to drive myself, could hardly walk as my left leg now dragged. I had no balance and having lots of dizzy spells at this point. He suggested I head to th ER but eventually decided we could wait until morning to see if things improved at all. If no improvement,  I was to go to ER. Tuesday Morning (day 4), my husband took me to the emergency room. I had reached the point of not being able to walk unassisted. At this point, the weakness and numbness I had on my left, had spread to my right side. We had no idea what was happening. We got right in and discussed what was going on. What lead up to me being there, etc. The ER ran blood work, xrays of my chest and 3 different MRIs trying to figure out if something happened like a stroke. NOTHING was present on any test they did yet there was something obviously wrong with me. My arm was still very Red and hot.. I had developed a lump in my arm where the vaccine was given. After ruling out everything the doctor could think of, he consulted with the on call neurologist since it was obvious to him something was happening with my neurological system. The diagnosis...my body was taking the vaccine as a toxin causing my neurological system to react and shut down. They felt that I should be starting feel better in the next few days as the vaccine settles into my system. I was told to follow up with a neurologist and my primary. I was then discharged from the hospital in the condition I had arrived.  Wednesday (day 5) I spent the day at home, not able to do anything. I napped most of the day. I still felt like crap and had no idea when I would start feeling better. No improvement that day.  Thursday (day 6) I woke up feeling a bit better. My right side was beginning to feel normal again but I was still feeling weak and unbalanced. This is also the day I meet with a neurologist to follow up. I don&#39;t know that this appointment had accomplished much as she didn&#39;t have access to all my medical records. She ended up prescribing me a medication to help with nerve pain I was having in my left side and referred me to do physical therapy. I am to follow up in 2 months.  Friday (day 7) my right side is back to pre-vaccine stage. My left is not. I feel pretty good except the occasional dizzy spell and the fact my left isn&#39;t working yet.  Day 8 and beyond...I&#39;m feeling ok. I went back to work but still have issues with my left side and residual dizzy spells. I began physical therapy 2 days a week to work on strengthening my left side however it has yet to help.  I am now just over 4 weeks post covid vaccine. I am now using a cane to help me walk as my left side has still not returned to normal. It is unknown if it will. I&#39;m in Physical therapy 2x a week still. The lump at injection site is now the size of a pea. I still have moments of unbalanced feeling and dizzy spells.

Along with it I would sweat profusely, and be hot but not running a temperature above normal. The temperature of the area when it was red, would range between 99.4-101.0

Took Claritin and Benadryl and slept with ice packs to cool my skin. 4/12 - hives were gone in the morning but came back that evening. Took Benadryl and made an appointment with my PCP for the following day. Still feeling dizzy and lightheaded. 4/13 - had appointment with PCP and was instructed to continue with Claritin and Benadryl for a week. At this point I was feeling EXTREME worry, panic and anxiety. Hear rate was elevated so I had to stay until that came down.  4/13-4/17 - Still dizzy and lightheaded - brain fog - continued with anxiety and worry. Set my alarm for every hour at night to be sure I would wake up. 4/18 - Finally feeling like myself - still a bit of worry but so much better!

                                                About two days after I received my vaccine, I was sitting out in the warm sun wearing shorts and noticed that my legs were becoming red and splotchy where exposed. I took note and thought it might be light sensitivity immediately following the vaccine, but would perhaps go away.  But it has continued to happen. Recently, I was sitting out in the warm sun wearing pants and experienced the same effect: red splotches all over my legs where they were getting warm from the sun, even though they were covered by denim. This had never happened to me previously, so I reported the occurrence to my doctor.

                                                Patient had a reaction immediately after the JJ vaccine. Patient passed out for 10-15seconds, her body stiffened up, she felt hot and then cold and started sweating excessively. Patients eyes closed briefly and then opened. Patient then became conscious and was unware what had happened.  Patient is not on any medication and had not eaten all morning. After administering the vaccine a small amount of blood came out. I gave her a cotton ball to apply on the area and to hold. After 20-30 seconds she said she felt faint and hot all of a sudden. Her body then went limp and her eyes began to close. Her body then stiffened up for a few seconds. After shouting her name a few times she regained consciousness and was able to talk. she didn&#39;t realize what had happened. Her body was fine again but she had urinated during the episode.  Upon speaking to the patient I learnt that she was nervous about the vaccination and she had felt dizzy in the past when giving blood. I observed the patient over the next 45 minutes. Her speech was fine, she was still a little light headed. She was in her seat for 40 minutes, then I asked her to stand and to move a little to see how she was. She was able to walk a bit but then sat down as she still felt light headed. She than sipped on water and continued talking and seemed to get some energy back.

I responded that it was only on my right leg and I didn&#39;t see any blood in urine or stool but that I had got my vaccine 4/11 she did call me around 10:15am and wanted to walk through some questions and asked about stomach pain and I had been having some pain and diherra and he also asked about vision changes and migrains and he said at that point because of the recent concerns with the vaccine he did want me to get checked out considering my history petechiae . He advised me to go to the er because of vaccine induced trombotic thromboctopenina (VITT) and he wanted to run some blood test and diagnostics. I arrived at the Medical center around 11am and I was seen by Dr  and explained everything that was going and he knew that they were concerd about VITT and they ran a CBC, and Estimated Glomerular Villtration Rate, Lypaz, Liver profile, collected urine and did a culture with an analysis and a pregnancy&#39;s test, Vitals were normal. the test came normal. All blood work came back normal, plateness was at 300, urine should a little bit of epidilla cells. They didn&#39;t feel like they needed to be concern about the VITT. I was discharged and then told to follow up with my family doctor and have had some communication, they asked that I followed up with a dermatologist and too look at genetics. 4/28 in the evening my left leg closer to my knee also started to itch it also developed a rash looking like strains but not as bad as what was on my right leg. but since then I have not had any more pop ups but I do still itch.

                                                I had flu like symptoms for 24 hours afterwards. My arm swelled up from shoulder to elbow. I had a bright red rash that started to go away and then came back and got worse over two weeks. I have a half dollar size lump at the injection site that showed up 24 hours after the vaccine - hard like bone. Not hard like a muscle knot or something. Hot to touch  - the whole rash area and itching. I went to  Urgent care  on the 21st -after it didn&#39;t go away in two weeks. They prescribed Cephalexin to take 1000 mg twice  a day for a week. The rash is mostly gone and heat is gone but lump is still there.  And followed up on Sunday 29th. The doctor said that the hard lump might be permanent. Doctor said the rash part looked like Cellulitis. Rash and fever are gone but lump is still there.

                                                Arm started feeling sore around 8pm day of vaccine. At 4am I woke up shivering uncontrollably with a headache. Arm soreness was worse and was now affecting my whole right arm and not just injection site. Hurt to move right arm any at all and chest felt like an elephant was sitting on it. Fever at 6am was at 102.5 F. Treated pain and fever with Tylenol. Temp went down to 101.9 at next check. Continued running a fever all day, shifting from sweating to shivering and being cold. Was very tired and stayed in bed most of the day.  Temp was down to 100.5 when went to bed. Arm is still sore today and woke up covered in sweat. Temp was at 99.9. Still very tired but chest tightness has gone down.

By the 25 minute mark, I noticed numbness in my cheeks, around my mouth and my forehead. I turned around and went back to the Health Department for observation. I sat with a nurse until I passed the hour mark for after the vaccine had been given. By that point, the numbness was gone around my mouth and forehead, but the numbness remained in my cheeks and they were visibly red where they were numb. At this point, I left the health department because my symptoms were getting better. It took about 2.5 hours for the numbness to gone in my cheeks.

                                                I went to a community event (held at a church) for the COVID vaccine. After the vaccine, I wanted the 15 minutes and felt ok - just hot. I went out to my car and over the next few minutes - I was getting hotter - My face was extremely hot and flushed, and hives started developing on my arms and chest. They were burning and itching; my skin was hot to the touch. My chest felt tight and my throat felt swollen, but I was able to breathe (breathe felt a little short, but I was able to take a full breathe). I was also dizzy and felt nauseous. I went to the ER, where they treated me for anaphylaxis with Benadryl, Pepcid, Breathing treatment, and a steroid. After about an hour or so I felt fine, and the dr gave me some medications to take over the next few days.

                                                I took the J&amp;J shot roughly at 11:50a, and naturally felt the immediate burn, and swear I felt the liquid moving through my arm. My arm was immediately tingly and numb simultaneously, and I felt...light and weird. Around 2p, I began feeling feeling lightheaded and weak, and at 6p, I had chills, severe weakness, dizziness and nausea. I couldn&#39;t stand up longer than 2 minutes without wanting to vomit and faint. I couldn&#39;t even stand up long enough to wash dishes, prepare a bowl of grapes to eat or shower. Throughout the night, I sweated so terribly from the chills to the point that my bed was soaked to the mattress pad, and currently at 2:02p on April 6th, I&#39;m still experiencing the extreme weakness, nausea, and chills.

Woke up at 5am with aches and pains all over, soreness at the injection (upper left arm) and a headache.  Took Excedrin at 9am and felt better until around 3 when the aches came back.  Took my temperature and was running a slight fever at 99.0 degrees.  Took Tylenol extra strength as a fever reducer.

                                                As the vaccine was being administered into my left deltoid, the vaccine hurt at the injection site and I immediately felt very strange and felt a rushing sensation to my head and throughout my body, with a concentration in my upper body.  It felt like an out of body experience: I fainted, hitting my head on the adjacent wall and fell to the ground, where the impact caused a bruise to my shoulder and back.  It was reported to me that I lost consciousness for about 10 seconds.  I felt disoriented, but lucid when I came to.  I was not exactly sure what happened, but I could feel that I hit my head on the right side and asked if I fainted since I was disoriented and on the floor.  With assistance, I was able to sit back on the bench, but felt extremely dizzy, light headed, fuzzy/strange type of blurry vision, and intense sweating.  I did not feel well and knew I would have an unsteady gait if I attempted to stand.  After about 15 minutes, I felt well enough to return home.

After about 10 hours from the time the shot was given I had tiredness, weakness, chills, muscle aches, and fever of 102.  No more serious symptoms lasted for about 10 hours.  After the fever went away, I was left with a splitting headache and some body aches and sweats.

                                                8:00am. Sunday, april 11th woke up with extremely sore neck on the right side. It became visibly swollen over the day and unable to turn my head without extreme pain. The lymph node in the area is extremely tender and warm to the touch. Around 5:30 a rash started occuring on the neck where it is swollen.  All of this is occuring on the opposite side of where the injection was given.  No other side effects have been noticed through out the days after the injection until today.

Noticed  a bit of a red rash on back that looked like &#34;pimples&#34;. Two days later noticed red streak under left armpit and painful to touch along with some swelling.  (not sure if this is still there) Did not miss work due to these side effects.

Patient states redness was approximately 2 inches around the injection site, patient states it is warm/hot to the touch and swollen. As of today 4/13/21 level of redness, swelling have been stable and she called us as she expected symptoms would have resolved by now and because she has an underlying swelling condition that may confound level of swelling.  Patient referred to contact primary care provider or seek treatment at walk-in clinic/urgent care for evaluation. Presently unaware if patient has followed recommendation and sought evaluation by healthcare provider, but expect that provider to complete their own VAERs or the patient will follow up with the pharmacy and we will submit a new form with those dates and outcomes.

On Saturday night and Sunday I felt some normal side effects like a severe headache, chills, nausea, and fatigue. Monday I felt better than normal and I thought I was in the all clear. Today (Tuesday) I woke up feeling like I had a stroke. I can still lift both arms and both sides of my face, but I can not think and feel like I am dying. I am scared to go to the hospital. I am unable to work. I feel incredibly emotional and unable to think. I feel so tired and the pain at the injection site is now even worse. I am getting chest pains, dizzy spells, really bad headache, and it feel like I am in a dream state unable to do things I normally can do. I am not okay and really regret getting the vaccine. I had no prior health concerns and probably would have survived covid, but it feels like I may never get my mental functioning back again.

                                                I got the vaccine on 4/7/21 at approx. 10am. Soreness at injection site started about an hour later. At approx. 3pm that day I began to have body aches and chills and had a low grade fever and a very bad and continuous headache. Those symptoms lasted approx. 24-36 hours. By Friday 4/9, I was feeling better and fever was gone. Starting approx. Sun 4/11 I began to have a dull headache wrapping around the back of my head/neck and began having muffled hearing (bilateral, but more prominent in left ear). On 4/15 at approx. 1:15pm I was sitting at my desk and suddenly my heart rate went from resting heart rate to 150. I could feel the pounding in my head and ear and also placing my hand over my heart. I tried to stand up to walk around thinking that might help my heart rate, but I felt faint, so I immediately drove myself to urgent care. My heart rate came down and was back to normal approx. 5-10 min from onset. EKG and CT were done in the ER. I was released approx. 5-6 hours after arrival and told to treat headache with Tylenol or Ibuprofen (which I have not done so far because I normally try not to take medications), and follow up with my primary doctor in a week. Headache and muffled hearing are still present today (4/17), predominately affecting left ear.

Hives and swelling itching  returned on  4/16 worse and spreading on legs armpits and neck-other patches spread all overs, took Benadryl at 5:00pm no 4/16, worsening and went to a local urgent care for treatment around 7:00pm on 4/16, told it may be related to the vaccine as it did look like a medication allergy.  Given liquid oral steroids at urgent care and prescription called in for prednisone and hydroxyzine to be started the next day on 4/17.  Hives did not go away at all, able to sleep until about 5:30am 4/17 and woke to worse itching and hives spread even worse, all over legs, hips, arms stomach back and neck.  Pharmacy not open until 10am 4/17, to pick up new prescriptions, so was not able to take the hydroxyzine and  prednisone until 11:15am today, 4/17, which was 1 hour ago, still extremely red, itchy, swollen hives all over as of right now.  Will give the medicine more time to work before going to emergency room, since my breathing has been fine.

The male nurse even looked at the needle. After the 1st 24 hours after shot i had a mild fever and tired. After 2nd day after receiving vaccine my arm  was very swollen and red.  Its been almost 2 weeks and  i still have a small knot at the injection site.  I occasionally feel a sharp pain in my arm from time to time.

Three weeks after my vaccination, my shot site began to hurt and then I started to exhibit an allergic reaction to foods I had never been allergic to previously. First it was ground turkey, and then two days later, I had an allergic reaction (hives, itchy mouth, and anaphylaxis) to chicken. A few days later I developed the same reaction to beef, and now I have the same reaction to berries and vegetables. My body seems to be attacking everything I eat.

                                                The evening I got headaches, chills, muscle, loss of smell and taste. The third day I woke up with swelling like hives and rash around my right eye. I took 10mg of Claritin. The hives spread around the back of my neck and the rest of my body over the course of the morning. Within a few hours it had spread to my chest and my throat felt like it was closing. I had taken Benadryl but it didn&#39;t seem to help. I was also fatigued but had no shortness of breath. I had not eaten anything before the hives started. It had been 48 hours after the shot that I was in the Emergency Room, the hives started around 36 hours. I was given Epinephrine 3mg, Prednisone and Famotidine and given steroids for a few days. I have not had any problems since the first three days after the ER visit.

I was given Pepcid, Benadryl and an Epi. I was released after a few hours and I went home and slept for two days. The guy that gave me the shot must have hit a bone and I was in pain for weeks. I am still experiencing some issues from it. My doctor has me stretching every morning due to my shoulder feeling tight. She says it could be a nerve issue.

                                                On Friday I woke up with swelling around both eyes and in my forehead. Swelling increased progressively so that by Sunday my left eye was nearly swollen shut. I saw a nurse practitioner on Monday and she gave me some steroid eye drops. This helped reduce inflammation a little bit but the swelling and redness continues. The skin was stretched, red, thin, itchy, and crusty. It has now been 15 days since my vaccine. The worst of the swelling has subsided but my eyelid and the area under my eye are still puffy, itchy, and red.  I am concerned based on the area of the reaction that this was related to an adverse interaction between the vaccine and dermal fillers I had Injected in February of 2020.   In addition to this reaction I had extreme fever, shakes, lethargy, and random superficial bruising. The bruising appeared in places where I had had no injuries 6-9 days after the vaccine and looked similar to those you see on people who do cupping - not round but like tiny red dots with pooled blood à stippled bruise with no pain.

                                                I started experiencing skin rash in face and flushing about two weeks after the vaccine about three times and had to take a Benadryl each time for the reaction even while being on Zyrtec on a regular basis. I started having under eye puffiness and body rashes right after these reactions that didn&#39;t go away even with regular allergy medication. I then started having a reaction similar to a nut allergy even though I ate something I made at home that had no nuts. I had some swelling on the right side of my face and eye. I also had some minor lip swelling and itching along with throat tightness. I had to take a Benadryl as well with this reaction. I have experienced episodes of this type everyday after eating or just in general and I&#39;m on a high histamine regimen as prescribed by the doctor. I was placed on steroids Prednisone for three days with no results after that. I have episodes where I feel my throat swelled and tightness along with itchy swelled lips, nasal pressure and itchy body.  I&#39;m still taking the his histamines as prescribed and Benadryl when the bad reactions occur. I have a epi pen.

It started around my ankles and lower legs (Thursday night) which made me initially think something had bitten me in my sleep. However it progressed rapidly throughout the day Friday to the point where my palms and the soles of my feet were raging with burn. my arms, top of hands, fingers, legs, top of feet, all were covered and burning/itching. I finally went to the hospital after trying topical creams with no success.

                                                Received shot around 2:10 pm. Experienced some stinging at injection site within a few seconds that became uncomfortable for several minutes then disappeared.  At 2:40 texted spouse that my face was tingling.  Started in cheeks and upper lip and spread to nose. A few minutes after that I started having hot flashes and my face was flushed.  Hot flashes lasted for an hour and subsided, tingling has mostly subsided except for area of cheek closest to my nose (it is 6 pm now).  Did not formally check into the urgent care facility but did contact them to see if this was normal.  Was advised to take antihistamine and, and if symptoms worsened to go to ER.  Symptoms did not get worse.

                                                I had redness that started small then spread throughout the arm. The diameter of the redness at its worse was about 4 inches. I also had itching, swelling, I have a hard lump on the injection site, the area of the lump is very tender, and the area is warm to touch. I called the advice nurse line and was told it was covid arm. It was treated with warm compresses, Tylenol for pain, antihistamines, and Triderm cream for the itchiness.  Now most symptoms have resolved, except for the hard lump on the injection site and mild tenderness.

                                                On the day of getting the shot it burned badly. About an hour later a knot formed at the injection site and my skinned turned red. On March 12, my arm was still red, feverish and the knot was still present. I went to the doctor on March 15 where he examined the knot. It was still feverish sore to touch and starting to turn the color similar to a bruise. He put me on an antibiotic because it seemed infected. I finished the antibiotic and as of today March 30, the knot is still present. It doesn&#39;t hurt to touch it anymore but I still have a hard mass a little bigger than a quarter at the injection site and the bruising color is still present. I go for an ultra sound of the knot on tomorrow, March 31.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 vaccine was administered to patient and the patient immediately reported pain at injection site, change in taste, and trouble breathing. Patient began gasping for air. The patient remained aware and able to communicate. I instructed a tech to call 911 and the operator instructed me to use a dose of epinephrine. After administration, the patient&#39;s breathing improved. EMT&#39;s arrived and took over care for the patient. I informed them of the time of vaccination and the time of epinephrine administration. The patient was then taken to the hospital to receive additional care.

I went to dr who advised I was having an allergic reaction and told me to take benedryl I had a 2in by 2inch hive under my skin at my time of visit which had gone down a little because of benedryl and it was extremely painful even 9 days out. I experienced extreme confusion and mental fog from Sunday all the way to Wednesday where I felt confused, and was having some rapid breathing.

                                                Received vaccine at 4:10pm on Thursday 4/8/21. 2 hours later, at 6:15pm, I noticed mild tongue swelling which slowly continued to worsen. I pulled out my Epipen but was not having any difficulties breathing and my tongue was only mildly swollen still, so I took Zyrtec at 8pm (which I usually do), and continued to monitor. Zyrtec seemed to slow the progression of tongue swelling slightly but at 10pm, I started having a dry cough and wheezing. I took Albuterol and Benadryl and that worked to stop the tongue swelling. Please note, the reason I don?t use Epi immediately is because I have Reynaud?s and it is contraindicated. So I use other rescue meds first if I can. My O2 sats remained above 95%, so I was not in full anaphylaxis. I did not eat anything or come in contact with anything within those 2 hours that would have caused the allergic reaction, so I am positive it was the vaccine. I also have a red, raised itchy bump at the site.

                                                5.5 hours after getting the vaccine, I had chills (guessing I had a fever) body aches, a headache, joint pain, muscle pain, skin pain, nausea, I was exhausted, felt very emotional (felt like crying), had the constant feeling like I needed to stretch, and I could not get comfortable or lay still. At one point my fever broke, I woke up at 245 am drenched in sweat. The symptoms previously stated all came back about 255 am. I could not get comfortable or sleep but was extremely exhausted.  I tossed and turned getting tiny naps here and there until I got out of bed at 8 am (4/8/2021), I was again drenched in sweat, tired, had a headache,  was nauseous and food sounded horrible. I could not move around much because of joint/muscle pain and would get random bouts of chills. I had to just lay down all day but was never hungry and  did not eat again until that night around 7pm. On 4/9/2021 I woke up at 630am drenched in sweat I was still tired and could not exert myself (just going downstairs made me have to stop and catch my breath) throughout the day I would get random nerve pain in the elbow  and forearm of the shot arm. This morning I woke up with the shot site hurting worse, a headache, still tired and drenched in sweat (it was 40 degrees in my house and i had a thin blanket covering me). My appetite is back today but still cannot exert myself.

                                                Normal side affects felt: fever, chills, body aches. Felt by 5pm and lasted until the next morning ~0700. After symptoms broke, the feeling of sluggish occurred all next couple of days. Throughout, it seemed like I could not quench my thirst.  Additionally, red bumpy rash on my legs (mostly thighs) occurred and itching along with it on legs. Not enough to go to emergency room, but definitely uncomfortable. Took Benadryl to help. Subsided about a week later. At injection site, only bruise which I am guessing was from some abnormal bleeding that occurred at injection. I barely had any soreness in the arm.  Lastly, a feeling of inability to take a deep enough breath. A feeling of if I had vicks on my chest type cool feeling when I took a breath. The feeling has lingered until now, but not enough to cause any issue. I can breath, but not full deep breaths. Because it has been getting better every day, I imagine it will subside soon. I will go to doctor if it does not get better.

This lasted 2 days.  Muscle pain  was the worst down the spine and at injection site, but persisted for 7 days! Joint pain worsened in hands particularly. Had to take anti inflammatory medication to alleviate it at day 6.  Still taking medication, so unsure if this is over.

Numbness lasted about an hour. 40-50 minutes post vaccine nausea would come and go. 4 hours post vaccine the typical flu-like symptoms began: extreme fatigue, mild headache, muscle weakness, painful skin, lack of appetite.

                                                I have many allergies and adverse events from prior vaccines, so I took a Benadryl before the injection. I was very pleased nothing detrimental happened at the time. My head and neck were a little itchy but went away, some dizzyness but went away, all after about an hour. The arm didn&#39;t blow up like usual.  That night, I started to experience the usual vaccine side effects i.e. headache, feverish, sweating, joint aches. All this I expected starting around 8:45 -9pm.   At about 10 - 10:30 pm, I began to have abdomen pain/pelvic pain... I started feeling like I was getting period cramps and lower intestinal discomfort. I just had my period though, so it didn&#39;t make sense (about 7 -10 days ago). I am also on the pill so I know for a fact I just had it and started a new pack. I was very confused and thought it was odd...can&#39;t be, maybe it would go away.   I woke up about 3am with intense uterus/period cramps which kept me up, in and out of sleep. About 5am I felt like I had my period (fluid down there), went to the bathroom and indeed, I was bleeding... a lot. The cramps continued, the bleeding continued and now 6 days later it is finally going away. I never get head aches and my head has continued to hurt on and off also.

                                                Itchy red rashes on upper body (stomach, arms, neck) started on April 11 afternoon and got better after taking 10ml Zyrtec.  Large red hot patches appeared again late night on April 12. This time felt like hot burning skin and it was all over (lower body, arms, chest, neck, back). Again, taking Zyrtec improved the symptoms.

Pharmacy gave Benadryl when advised of reaction.   15 mins later family drove me to ER to wait to for the Benadryl to take effect in case ER services were needed. ER services were not needed once Benadryl took effect.  I?m at day 14 and still having lingering reoccurring headaches and fatigue.

                                                Around 6 pm on the ninth, I started to feel lethargic; really lethargic. 8:30 pm - 100.5 fever. 09:00 pm I had chills that shook my body. Very intense. Extreme body aches and especially legs which prompted me to use a weighted blanket. That was all overnight and excessive sweating overnight. That may have been from the fever. I had nausea that started around midnight. That was mild. I did notice a little bit of a headache at that time as well which was mild. Saturday, fever all day, fatigue. Overnight that night - a little achy; but the chills had gone away. Tuesday night the body aches had gone away - they had diminished Saturday- Monday. I had body aches until about 6 or 7 pm on Monday. The fatigue -all this week I&#39;ve still been dragging - I&#39;m still tired. The fever would go up and down with Tylenol but I needed it until Sunday night. Headache - the first one was gone Saturday morning. I had a headache  Sunday evening and Monday morning. It was gone about lunch time.  The injection site was tender with the delivery of the shot until Sunday when I went to bed. It was not pain but just tender to the touch. Usually that happens with any shot for me but usually it doesn&#39;t stay tender for that long. April 13th - Televisit with a Physician&#39;s Asst in my doctor&#39;s office.

On Saturday, 4 days after receiving the vaccine, I had severe pain that decreased after taking tylenol 3. The arm pain has been consistently present since I received the vaccine.  4. March 25, 2021, I told my nurse practitioner about the continued pain; no intervention was done.  4. On March 28, 2021, I had chills and arm pain, so as a healthcare provider myself, I suspected cellulitis. 5. On 3/302021, I started antibiotic Keflex and finished entire course for suspected cellulitis, yet had no warmth or redness at injection site or surrounding area.  6. 4/15/2021, evaluated by NP again for continued arm pain, as it hurts to turn my steering wheel of my car, lift my arm in any way. Had normal bloodwork for suspected DVT, and STAT ultrasound ordered, after I requested NP to change order to STAT 7. 4/16/2021, had scan for DVT which was negative.  8. Used Tylenol and warmth to area on 4/16/2021, at 11:00pm, and pain increased!!! 9. I am concerned that I have muscle injury at this point, and I need to speak with someone

My left hand experienced the same shooting pain followed by tingling in my fingers. My right arm them experienced the same pain and tingling. I then began to sweat, get dizzy and felt like fainting. I have had pain and tingling in my hands and feet ever since, along with sensitivity. I also have pain in my joints and legs similar to what I imagine arthritis would feel like. I also have throbbing chest pain and pain in my legs since vaccination.

Did not itch which I found strange bc they looked like flea bites. But I went to the ER and said they were purpura.   Also as of Tuesday  April 13th, I have had throbbing headaches daily lasting on and off all day.   Finally today and last night (April 19 and 20th) I have been dizzy.   I am feeling weird.  I regret taking this vaccine.  If there was a way to undo this I would.

Those symptoms lasted about 24 hours and, by midday Wednesday, she was back to her baseline of intermittent dry cough, shortness of breath, and no smell or taste.  It wasn&#39;t until Sunday, two days ago, that she developed sharp, pinpoint right superior parietal scalp pain that, after a few doses of OTC Aleve, did somewhat improve.  Other than two 220 mg OTC Aleve tabs twice daily, she has not been taking anything else for her symptoms other than prescribed asthma/allergy meds. She states that her shortness of breath has been helped from the use of albuterol as needed.  Unfortunately, the Aleve has not helped with her chest pain, which she describes as a &#34;constant ache.&#34;  Initially, patient had some pleurisy, but that has apparently cleared up.     No history of CVT, PE, and she does not smoke or take oral contraceptives.

                                                Within 12 hours I had uncontrollable shaking due to being very cold, 102 fever, profuse sweating all over body for 5 days and completely drenched during the night, severe body aches - loss of full mobility in arms and legs, extremely tired. These symptoms lasted for 48 hours. The sweating continued for 5-6 days throughout the day and was worse at night.   The week after the vaccine, a bump developed on my wrist. It&#39;s believed to be a ganglion cyst, but I won&#39;t have confirmation until after I see a specialist. About a week or two after the vaccine I also developed burning in my feet and it became uncomfortable to walk.

Each spot last about 1 day, then fades and then another 1 or 2 pop up in another spot. This started one or two days after receiving the vaccine and is more prolific now than at any time.

                                                Starting about 2 hrs after receiving the shot, muscle pain throughout left arm, spreading through all muscles of body by 5am. Sever periods of chills followed by sweating and feeling hot. Nausea, headache. Took Excedrin, Aleve and tums. Worst of the symptoms subsided by 24 hrs post vaccine administration. Slight nausea and headache still persists at time of filling this report out. I feel it&#39;s important to note that I had COVID in December and feel the adverse reactions were due to having sufficient antibodies against COVID. Perhaps it shpuld be recommended that people get antibody titers to determine if the vaccine is necessary as is done to determine if HepB boosters are necessary.

                                                Upon injection into the right arm, blood started to pour out of the injection site. Bleeding stopped once the nurse administered pressure. There were no immediate side effects present, other than soreness at the injection site. Approximately 17 hours after the vaccination, the following symptoms started: nausea, malaise, fever (102.3), chills, headache, and lower back pain. The onset of side effects was intense and required that I immediately stop what I was doing and rest.

                                                Shortly after the vaccine on the drive home the injection site got super hot, the arm began to swell and turn red.  I developed a fever and my sinuses got really stuffy.  I began to throw up profusely which made all symptoms from other issues occur causing me to swell all over and because I couldnt take any meds or keep anything down I went to the ER.   While there I began wheezing and experiencing SOB which still is an issue today.  I have foggy moments where my brain seems so foggy that I am having issues with my short term memory.  I was administered IV fluids, IV morphine and IV ibuphropen to help with the symptoms and was hospitalized for less than a day further evaluation

                                                I have a history of anaphylaxis, and disclosed that to the medics so they watched me more carefully, which was good, as while I did not experience anything that severe, I did immediately get itchy, turn red and feel quite nauseated. However,  after they monitored me awhile, I told them I felt okay to go home. The next day I had the expected mild flu-like symptoms, which I anticipated. However, what?s been atypical is they returned tenfold three days later. This time with a much higher fever (103), severe chills, fatigue, a seemingly never-ending headache,  muscle spasms,  chest palpitations and suddenly I am experiencing asthma (which is typically seasonal) and am coughing, too.  I?m now a week past when I was vaccinated and each day was feel worse, not better. I have had to cancel my clients and hire a sitter to care for my kids as I am too weak and ill to do it.  I looked up common reactions and nothing states chest pain and/or asthma, nor that it should last this long. That said, as I am high-risk, I work from home and homeschool both of my young kids. Thus, I have been nowhere aside from the vaccine site. Moreover, my partner, our kids and sitter get routinely tested for me,  and everyone is negative. Thus, it appears I am having prolonged, heightened side-effects much more intense than the ?mild? flu-like symptoms otherwise reported, which is concerning. I took no medication prior to receiving the vaccine, either.

                                                Immediate injection site pain including stinging and burning.  Site continued to sting for over an hour post injection.  Burning feeling at injection site continued for several hours.  Brain fog and chills set in within 2 hours post injection.  Fatigue, headache, and joint stiffness and pain started about 4 hours post injection.  Injection was given on left arm; left hand became painful about 4 hours post injection, as though someone had put it in a vice.  Joint pain worsened.  Upon laying down to sleep, I became so cold I could not get warm even with an electric blanket on high.  Started to feel stabbing pains in my jaw, back of my neck and down behind my shoulder blade on my left side.  Headache worsened and started to feel pressure in my ears.  Joints, my knees in particular, felt like they were made of gravel and someone was stabbing them with a hot poker.  Did not sleep due to pain.  Has been 20 hours post vaccine, injection site is still very painful and swollen.  Joint pain, headache, fatigue and chills continue.  Was unable to go to work today.

I elevated over the next 24 hours frequently an swelling went away.  2 - On Friday, March 26, swollen glands under my left armpit (shot received in left arm), swelling is completely gone as of 3/29.  3 - the evening of 3/28/21 I became itchy on my scalp, arms and back.  I have showered and applied lotion and have not introduced anything new to my routine which is why I believe it may be shot related and worth mentioning.  The intensity is mild but if it persists or worsens I will contact my doctor.

I shivered and sweated for 12 hours overnight with a severe headache. I tossed most of the night and had to get up to pee 3 times throughout the night - which is extremely uncommon. By 24 hours after the injection, I still had a strong headache and was mostly able to regulate my body temp. By 36 hours after, I felt tired but no longer had a headache or chills. My injection site is red, raised and very tender.

                                                It started with my hands getting red and scaly, which at first I passed off as my skin getting irritated from washing my hands at work). Thursday the backs of my hands began breaking out in hive like spots and I started getting itchier skin on my arms, legs, back and stomach. When I got home from work I was breaking out in spots that almost looked like chicken pox (which I had as a child) on my arms, back and stomach, the backs of my hands were rough and bumpy and looked like I&#39;d touched poison ivy, bruise like rashes on my leg. By Friday the hive like spots were spreading down my legs and up my neck to my face, my scalp began breaking out, the skin behind my ears became inflamed and scaly. I had developed every childhood rash I&#39;ve ever had in a matter of days. I had no fever and otherwise felt fine. I saw a nurse practitioner, but there was no obvious cause for such a sudden flare up of so many different skin reactions at the same time, so she prescribed Prednisone and a topical steroid cream - I have been taking and using both of these since Saturday and the flare ups have subsided and the worst area are drying up and the inflammation is going down. I&#39;m not sure if it is related to the vaccine or not,  but I cannot think of anything that&#39;s ever caused such a random flare up all over my body.

                                                Intense body aches (I was less achy after my first marathon) that kept me from sleeping despite taking tylenol and sleeping medication from 11pm to about 10am. Added advil to the tylenol and the body aches lessened and I was VERY tired until about 5pm the next day (slept most of that time.) Injection arm was very sore for several days. Everything I experienced seemed to track with the expected vaccine side effects though. I was never worried that my experience was abnormal.

                                                The shot was administered by a young woman at pharmacy, who I later learned was an intern. She injected the shot less than two fingers down from my shoulder bone, much higher than I have ever had an injection given before.  I immediately felt intense pain, and the intern had trouble pushing the syringe down fully.  She said ?I need help!?, and her male manager ran over, and quickly jabbed the syringe further into my arm, and pressed extremely hard down on the syringe, forcing the remaining contents into my arm. I immediately felt a shooting, searing pain down my entire arm, into my wrist, and  my arm went numb, felt heavy, and tingly by my hand.  The manager pulled the needle out of my arm, and said ?you must have hit bone, the needle is bent?.  I then felt extremely nauseous and woozy, and my vision started going in and out.  I fanned myself and after about five minutes my vision stabilized, and I felt less nauseous.  It is now 9 hours later and I have intense shoulder and neck pain, and limited range of motion of my shoulder.

All thru that night I was in pain.  Next day still felt like my head was in a vice with a migraine.  The chills had gone away. still had body aches just not as severe.  Day 3 after vaccine.  SLight headache (nothing  like the vice headache) , arm is still very sore. body aches have subsided considerably.   I treated with taking Tylenol and using a heating pad on my arm and back to help with body aches and pain,.

Patient was instructed by her Md to get the Janssen vaccine instead of the 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine that was due on 3/28. A few minutes after the injection, the patient became itchy and had increased respiratory rate. Despite using her inhaler and receiving a dose of liquid Benadryl, the patients breathing worsened, and I injected the patient with an Epipen. Patients breathing improved and we monitored her for an hour before releasing her. A follow-up call was made on 4/13 to confirm the patient was stable.

Carried on with my day like nothing happened.  3/29/2021: (1) Uncharacteristic, debilitating headaches began started around mid-afternoon (ish) and continued on/off - occurred approximately 5-7x and largely tapered off by 4/9/2021.  (2) extreme soreness continuously occurring on the upper right side of my back b/w the spine and scapula. I could barely move it most days. Has gotten slightly better beginning 4/12/2021, but remains unresolved as of this report.  4/15/2021: woke up with severe headache again.

Made effort to continue to raise the arm and engage the muscle to alleviate pain, which helped by the end of *that day*, though tenderness persisted at the injection site for the following 4 to 5 days, including feeling pain when sleeping on that arm. Also, on the day of receiving the vaccine and dealing with the initial sore arm, I experienced a surge of energy lasting into the evening, that is common to me right before I fall sick ( for example as a runner, it sometimes manifests as a PR and then soon after that I get sick). The morning after the vaccine, I woke up slightly queasy, ate breakfast,  went for a bike ride and hike, then headache &amp; nausea appeared near lunchtime (1 pm). I pushed through the rest of the afternoon but headache/nausea worsened, and by late afternoon (maybe 5 pm) I also had developed body aches, chills (with sweats), and low-grade fever.

This continued for the following two days.  On 4/10 I began what I thought to be menstrual bleeding, this flow  has been consistent and  persistent  as of today 4/18 with no indication of reducing in volume. On  4/15  I began to notice pin point non-clustered petechiea  throughout my arms legs and chest.  The number present on  my body appears to be increasing in a random distribution.  No other observable abnormalities at this time.

I additionally broke out with a Herpes 2 outbreak on 4/19/2020. I have had Herpes Simplex Virus 2 since November 2017. However, this is the first case of Shingles I have ever had.

                                                Within minutes of shot, on the shot going in - it stung so bad I cried and I have a high pain tolerance &gt; extreme nausea right after the shot was in; I felt short of breath - Heartrate - While standing in line, my heartrate was 75 or 76  and it went up to 130  beats per minute after the vaccine (I have a watch that tells me); my heart was racing. I was putting cold water bottles on my neck to feel better. Heartrate went from 130 to 100 at 45 minutes out. It stayed in the hundreds for a couple of hours. About three hours after shot - I developed itching and hives all over - chest, arms, and tops of thighs. I took Benadryl. The injection site on arm stayed incredibly painful - I couldn&#39;t even move my arm. 4/12/2021 - I got in contact with someone from Clinic. They felt like there had been a reaction to vaccine - advised to continue Benadryl. A localized reaction to injection site. First 48 hours  bone, muscle, joint pain was extreme - it hurt to be alive. It took a week for that to fade so I could function again. Got in contact with Dr. again 19th. Swollen oval under my skin about 2 -3 inches long at injection site; fatigue and nausea is still there. Ran some bloodwork. Advised to take Benadryl when itching came back. This morning, I called the doctor today 20th - an allergist was pulled in for this conversation as well - I was prescribed to take Zyrtec; Claritin and a prednisone (to prevent reaction from continuing) and also Zofran for the long term reaction to the vaccine. Watch the injection site for any redness and heat (there&#39;s none right now). Three days after vaccine, I did get a blistery rash across my neck at my collarbone area, down my chest and under my breast and across my rib cage on front and a little on my back on the back of my shoulders and down along the spine. Additionally there was a flat orangish rash that developed - on my face and nose. And then my skin started peeling off there and it (that flat orangish rash) showed up  also on the middle of my chest too right in the middle of the other rash on my chest. That is improving with the medications I&#39;m taking.

The main thing is that I slept a lot and was unable to work which lasted 9 days. The thing that I went to urgent care for pelvic pain, body aches and pain, developed an UTI and my symptoms cleared at home with medications.  At the urgent care lab work and urine culture was performed. When I went to the urgent care they said I also had tachycardia.  My symptoms have resolved.

I took some Aleve - that helped some with the symptoms - but not efficacious. It turned into bone deep pain that made me cry. I would say 7 on the pain scale. That lasted two days. It started slow and then it got big. It was very bad for 12-16 hours. I didn&#39;t leave bed and I cried a lot. Worse than childbirth. I was left with another two days after that with some severe fatigue and then I started recovering. About 10 days after vaccine,  on the morning of the 17th, I thought I had a spider bite but it was the beginning of a rather severe shingles outbreak which I haven&#39;t had before.  I had a telehealth appt with employee health -  I was treated  with anti-viral - Valtrex generic on the 19th. The rash was mostly gone with the  medicine - everything is scabbed over but the nerve pain is still here to this day. I still missed work this week.

                                                I received the shot on 5/12. On the evening of 5/13 starting around 5pm I had fever of 101.4 and chills which lasted through the night.  My fever broke the morning of 5/14.  My arm has a hard knot where I received the shot that is very painful.  This was reaction was within a few hours of receiving the vaccine. I still can&#39;t sleep on my left side as of 5/18, but the knot is getting smaller.  My lymph nodes under my left arm where I received the shot are noticeably swollen.  This happened most noticeably on 5/14 and remains swollen.

I had a rash on my shoulders, ankles and forearms. It was little spots about six inches. Those symptoms lasted for 36 hours. After that point I had very low Oxygen levels and my Asthma was very severe. My Nebulizer and rescue inhaler were not very effective. It has been almost nine weeks and my Oxygen levels are still lower than normal at 96 or 97.  Before the vaccine my Asthma was controlled and I rarely used the rescue inhaler. I use my rescue inhaler once daily. I am using my Nebulizer once daily. Immediately after the vaccine I was using my Nebulizer four times daily. It is still not near the level of control I had before the vaccine.

                                                Several hours after the vaccine my head started to itch, the next day I had a full body rash and my skin was red and painful. My underarms, genital area, head, and eyebrow area was severely itchy. I went to the hospital where they gave me a 12 day steroid taper, steroids in the hospital and monitored me until my skin calmed down. They also gave me hydroxozine and Pepcid. Two days after the steroid taper was over the rash returned and my primary care gave me 7 days of steroids. The day that ended I felt itching in my head  and eyebrows and my skin began peeling, and I saw a dermatologist that day who prescribed a 21 day steroid taper. I have just finished this medication today. I have missed work due to symptoms. The second time the rash came back my face looked like I had shingles and was painful to the touch.
