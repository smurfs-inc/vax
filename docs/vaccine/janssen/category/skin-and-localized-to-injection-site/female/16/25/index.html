                                                began with body aches in the knees, took Tylenol and went to bed @9:30pm. Woke up @12:30am with chills, a headache, soreness in the injection site, and body aches in the neck, back and legs.  Got up and tried stretching and drinking water. Stoped drinking water when I felt nauseas. Did not throw up. Took Ibuprofen and melatonin before falling asleep about 30 minutes after taking the medication. Woke up @3:00am and chills were gone, only left with pain in the knees and injection site. Wasn?t able to sleep until around 4:45am. When I woke up @7:45 am, I still had slight pain in the knees, I took Tylenol @10:45 am. Pain was on and off throughout the day. I took a hot bath, that helped the pain tremendously. Fatigue throughout the day. After sleeping the day after the shot, all symptoms are gone, only soreness in the injection site.

                                                I felt really good until late at night when I got a pretty mild headache, then I started shivering and I didn&#39;t stop for nearly an hour. My muscles were very tense and the headache got worse. I took ibuprophen and that seemed to help with the shivering and lessen the headache. It is now the morning after and I just have a mild, but persistent headache and skin sensitivity which I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related to getting the vaccine or not.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after injection, I woke up after sleeping for an hour with excruciating pain in all of my limbs, especially the injection site. I could not move any of my limbs. Not because of pain, I simply could not move them. I had a fever (temp not recorded, I could only tell because I was burning up.) I was very nauseous, but never vomited. I was shaking very hard and had the chills despite being covered by a blanket and simultaneously burning up. Both of my ankles that I had suffered a running injury to several weeks ago (I have an upcoming doctor&#39;s appointment to get them checked out) were pulsing with pain. I developed a minor headache. Eventually I either drifted back to sleep or stayed awake, because I don&#39;t remember anything up until around 5am when I was able to get up and take Tylenol and water. All symptoms were gone except for the minor headache.

                                                Very large hives formed on my right shoulder, underneath both of my buttocks, behind my knee, and on my thumb.  All of the hives were painful. My thumb swelled up a couple of hours after I noticed the one on my shoulder and thighs, and I watched and felt as my thumb swelled up. The next morning I woke up and they were still there, but no new hives formed.

                                                After about 4 hours of having the shot, I got extremely light headed and nauseous. About the same time I got really bad chills and was shaking aggressively from the cold and got very bad pain in my joints, back, neck and injection site. My skin felt very sensitive and hurt to touch.  I took medication and felt a little better but was unable to eat due to the nausea. A few hours later I still had very sensitive skin and nausea but I was very hot and couldn?t cool off. The following morning at about 8am on April 9 I woke up with hives on my ears, back of my neck up to the top of my head and the center of my chest. I still had severe body pains and my hives spread throughout the day to my face, inflating my forehead, nose and lips. I was still unable to eat because of the nausea and I was still taking ibuprofen which usually eliminates my hives. My body pain, nausea and hives stayed consistent the entire day despite taking the proper medication precautions. At about 12:30am on April 10 I checked my temperature at 100.3 degrees. At 2:30am it dropped to 98.9 degrees. The first meal I was able to eat was at about 7:30am on April 10 while take over the counter anti-nausea medication. It?s currently about 5:15pm on April 10 and most of my hives have reduced to redness, my body pain and injection site pain is still consistent and my nausea has barely reduced.

Felt these symptoms from about 4:00 PM until about 11:00 PM when I went to sleep. The next morning, 24 hours after receiving the vaccine, my head still ached/throbbed, and my back still felt incredibly awful. My left shoulder was also still very sore. As of now, almost 60 hours after the vaccine, the only symptom still remaining is the very sore shoulder. I cannot extend it fully without immense pain, but it still hurts otherwise.

                                                She felt totally fine after the shot and many hours after.  She felt fine to go to a horseback ride lesson at 4.  Half way through the lesson she acutely felt like she was going to faint/nauseous (she had a ton to eat that day, had a bottle of water just before lesson, etc. so she knew it wasnt those kinds of things) and then had a crushing headache with a lot of &#34;pressure behind her eyes&#34;, dizziness, and a really &#34;strange&#34; feeling like out of body, bawling crying, and started FREEZING.  I got there 15 minutes later and she was under lots of blankets, white as a sheet, freezing, said her spine was sore from the top to bottom... just tons of symptoms.  When I got her, she moved to my car and had seat heater on high and I had to put all the clothes from a suitcase I had in my car on top of her bc she was so cold and her skin was burning up.  I gave her 3 200 advil and a bottle of water.  ½ hour later i had a thermometer and even after that she still had 102.3 fever.  She was rambling some nonsense and seemed very disoriented for a while. She went straight to shower and laid on the floor of the shower for ½ hour, took cold medicine, and evnetually went to sleep.  In the night she was freezing again and the fever had spiked and she took more advil.  The next day she felt much better in the morning and fine by lunchtime.  She was VERY sick/uncomfortable with basically every symptom under the sun.

She was conscious when i ran to her.She said she usually feels nausea after vaccines and feels like this was just her normal reaction. She refused an ambulance and felt like she was ok. We gave her ice water and and ice pack as she bruised her head when she fainted. We continued to monitor her and she kept refusing medical assistance. She had a friend come to drive her home.

                                                Within a few hours of getting the vaccine started with Flu symptoms of severe body aches, chills, headache, fever. Day 2 a bit better but still low grade fever of 101 degrees, nausea, weak, body aches but not as bad. In the evening around 5pm noticed ears starting to enlarge but didn&#39;t think much of it, by morning today at 7:30am I felt my face was swollen and numb on the right side. Now both ears were swollen and the area in my face was red. When I took my temperature on my forehead I was normal however the swollen cheek was 102 degrees. At that point I went to urgent care to get it looked out.  Currently at 6:30pm on 4/3/2021 the redness in my cheek has turn back to normal however the face is still swollen but not as bad.

After the migraine, my body and head is sensitive to rapid motion and loud noises.

                                                Jansen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA The first side effect began at 4/10/21 ~9:00 PM, approximately 6 hours after injection.  The very first noticeable symptom was chills. As the night progressed, chills came in cycles while headache and an abnormal sensation in the head became apparent. Throughout the night, there was also a feverish feeling, body aches, periodical sweating, and sore arm at injection site. I?ve experienced all these symptoms (except the sore arm and sweating) while being sick with Covid-19 approximately over a week prior to the vaccination. Symptoms continued until the next day, 4/11/21, and they gradually went away as the day progressed and after taking doses of acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Symptoms completely dissapeared by the evening of 4/11/21.

My friend told me that my forehead was puffy (swollen). I laid down and I realized I was really really cold but skin was hot to touch. I think I had a fever.  I was shaky and shivery and trembling. I tried to take a nap. Fell asleep for an hour - don&#39;t remember that time at all - but my friend told me I went to sleep. My smart watch was telling me my heart rate was 120s and 130s while I was sleeping. I debated whether I should go to the Dr. and I called the school police and they took me to the ER   - at 03:00 am on the 8th - and they told me to rest for  day and wait it out. I still feel like I have a lot of adrenaline - my watch says that my heart rate is way to high for what I&#39;m doing. It&#39;s usually in 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s but it&#39;s in the 120&#39;s and 130&#39;s every day and I am really shaky with adrenaline. I have had a headache since Wednesday night and it hasn&#39;t gone away. If it goes past Wednesday, I will go to my primary care doctor but otherwise no treatment at this time.

                                                A few hours after I got home from getting the shot, my lower body started to ache super bad. My skin started to hurt like I had rug burn, but I wasn&#39;t surprised because that happens to me when I get the flu. My legs and groin region started to hurt more and more and I got the chills. It was extremely bad and I was sort of writhing but I told myself I was overreacting. At around 8 or 9, I decided I would sleep it off and went to bed. At 1:00 am, I got up to use the bathroom and I began feeling lightheaded. I thought I had just stood up to fast so I continued. As I walked, i got more and more dizzy and I couldn&#39;t hear well. When I sat on the toilet, I realized I wasn&#39;t going to be able to get back up, so I sat and waited. I started to get super hot so I took my shirt off. I finally was able to get up and walked towards the sink but I collapsed before I got there. I started drinking the sink water and ran my shirt under the water and put it on my head to cool off.  This really helped so I went back to my room to call my mom. I have never fainted before or come this close to fainting. For the rest of the night I had the worst migrane of my life that gave me aura in my left eye and made my left arm and left side of my face go numb, as well as pulsing in my head. The pain on my skin, and in my legs and head was still there for two days after but it was manageable enough for me to go about my day. I tried to exercize to ease the muscle pain but this did not work.

I take Hydroxyzine at night and in the mornings - Loratadine - to help with the itching. I&#39;m still a little itchy but my rash has gone away for the most part - it does pop up again sometimes but not as bad as it was. It&#39;s not as painful.

                                                Pt&#39;s throat and tongue and jaw felt like it was swelling. She had extreme pain in her arm and her hands started swelling. She got a rash on her arms and on her hands. I took her to the urgent care facility and they gave her a shot of Decadron and a shot of Benadryl. They also Prescribed steroids. She was very sick like she had a severe flu. I was very worried as her mother. She was weak and slept constantly. Her arm could barely move and It almost appears as if she had had a stroke. She had brain fog and she wasn&#39;t remembering her days like she was missing memory. After five days, the reaction started up again so we took her to the emergency room. They did a variety of tests including a urinalysis, CT of the brain, ECG 12 lead, peripheral venous duplex of her upper arm. Everything checked out OK so they put her on more steroids and sent her home. Pt is still having arm pain a month later but finally feels better.

                                                5 hours after the vaccine, I started having a sore arm at the injection sight and a low grade fever of 100.0 with chills and I was uncontrollably shaking. I took ibuprofen at 8:00pm. That night at about 9:00 my fever was 100.8 and I felt extreme fatigue.  I woke up at 3:30am feeling both extremely hot and cold with a bad headache and my temperature was 101.5. I took ibuprofen again at 3:30am. I then woke up at 5:15 am with a horrible headache and was very hot and sweating. I put cold compresses on my forehead and back of my neck which helped. The entire night, my arm with the injection site was very painful and stiff to move.

                                                The first night I had a severe headache, but it was gone the next day, had no symptoms until yesterday, March 18th, after waking up with a huge rash all over my upper thighs and stomach, and the next day, March 19th, it had spread to my arms, and further down my legs, and is starting to spread to my face. No rash has appeared at the injection site, which led me to believe this wasn&#39;t a result of the vaccine, but I have made any behavior or diet changes, and have no known allergies, so the only thing I could think to cause the rash was due to the vaccine. I am not saying at all that this means I regret getting the vaccine, I just thought it would be responsible of me to report these symptoms, in case others were experiencing a delayed rash and was concerned. The rash hasn&#39;t caused any distress other than existing, there&#39;s no itching or pain from it, it just keeps spreading fairly rapidly.

They appear as small bug bites and are very itchy. They are hot to the touch and only slightly risen.   Additionally, at around 10 hours following the vaccine, I experienced severe muscle aches and chills (but this was listed as a typical side effect).

                                                Hives on my arms and stomach developed within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine at 2:16. I left the facility after 30 minutes because the hives did not get any worse and I did not experience any other symptoms. At home about 8 hours later, I started feeling exhausted, weak, and my body was literally shaking whenever I stood. Overnight, I felt feverish, I had the worst nightmares, and woke up every few hours. On Friday (next day) I felt dizzy whenever I moved, nauseous whenever I stood, and once when I was standing too long I started vomiting.  On Friday evening I went to a local ER (all the urgent cares were closed) at my primary care Dr?s suggestion to ensure that I wasn?t having an allergic reaction to the vaccine. The ER determined that the hives were likely an allergic reaction but all other symptoms were reactions due to the vaccine.

                                                Around 5:00 PM after having gotten my shot, I arrived home from a drive down to meet my sister. Precautions were taken, masks were worn, safe social distance was maintained and I have no reason to believe any of the symptoms I experienced upon returning home were related to anything other than the vaccine, particularly since first that is how vaccines work and second one of my friends who was vaccinated at the same time as me at the clinic was going through similar pains.  It started as a discomfort in my intestines or possibly just below my stomach in general. I thought my pants were too tight but just in case I let my mom take over driving the rest of the way home. When I got to the house, I had about an hour of usable time left before I went into a complete state of delirium. We&#39;re not sure how high my fever actually got before my mom woke up and checked in on me at 9:00 PM, but after having pulled the covers away I registered at 102.5° F. I was screaming in a half-awake and half-asleep nightmare, trying to get someone to come help me and unable to get anyone&#39;s attention. I would, as a result, like to insist that it be added to recommendations to not be alone after getting the vaccine! For the whole first night! I believe that I genuinely could have died. My brain was melting for lack of more proper medical terminology, and I stopped being able to understand and speak my own first language in an incredibly confused state. This was entirely a result of two simultaneous factors: Fever and Chills. First, the fever made my skin ache. Wearing any clothing hurt. But once I took off my pants in exchange for some breezy shorts, I was covered in goosebumps and feeling frozen even though it was solidly in the 70s. I claimed under blankets and still couldn&#39;t get warm enough. The backs of my thighs were insanely hot in comparison to the fronts of them, so I just warmed my body under 3 layers of blankets trying to get the chills to go away. I did that for about four hours during which time I was basically constantly screaming incoherently.

                                                Johnson and johnson covid-19 vaccine eau  March 20th - allergic reaction to covid vaccine Johnson &amp; Johnson. Allergic reaction started approximately 2 minutes after receiving shot. It started with itching and redness on my arms and upper chest. After approximately 10 minutes, I knew something was wrong and I signaled an attendant. They immediately brought me over to the EMTs on site, where they looks me over and started drawing up IV Benadryl. In the time it took for them to draw up IV Benadryl and insert the IV, the hives on my chest started to turn into burning and ice sensations intermittently. As soon as they administered the IV Benadryl, the itching redness and hives on my arms went away within a couple minutes, and I was left with only redness on my upper chest. They felt comfortable with me getting a ride to the ER from my dad and not getting emergency transport. At the ER, they gave me pepcid and prednisone. About an hour and a half later, I started developing chest tightness and hives and redness on the side of my face. They decided to administer more Benadryl and start epinephrine. I was discharged a couple hours later.  March 22nd - I went back to the hospital, with complaints of severe stomach pain. The stomach pain lasted approximately 24 hours.  March 20th to march 26th - I experienced extreme fatigue. I was exhausted to the point where on Wednesday I took a ten minute shower and by the end of it I had to lay down again because I was shaking from exhaustion.  Symptoms improved slightly until April 5th where it started taking a turn for the worse.  April 5th - I started noticing black spots in my vision that wouldn&#39;t go away. They didn&#39;t move and they stayed in one spot for hours until I fell asleep and then they&#39;d be gone the next morning. They usually started around 8:00 or 9:00 at night. Sometimes a couple hours earlier. They came every day until Friday April 9th when they did not come.   April 5th to present - I also started noticing light-headedness, motion sickness when I stood still or sat in a chair, nausea, neck pain, and periods of muscle weakness in the neck. These symptoms have not stopped.  Friday April 9th around 6:45 p.m. I started having a bad migraine, I noticed in the bathroom at work my eyes were dilating over and over and over again rapidly. The pain was very high. I ended up leaving work early and going to the emergency room. While at the emergency room they treated my migraine with a cocktail of Benadryl, toradol, and compazine. It reduced the pain at the time, however it did not take away the migraine.  Friday April 9th to present - My migraine has continued from April 9th and is still happening. I have been having severe light sensitivity, sound sensitivity, and trouble reading. The rapid dilation of my eyes stopped April 10th, however my eyes stayed dilated until April 12th.  In addition to all of my other symptoms, there are others that I am not as positive are relevant. I have asthma and it has been worse over the past couple of weeks, it it is not usually worse this time of year. I&#39;ve been also been having quite a bit more light bruising than normal over the past two weeks and over the past one and a half weeks I have noticed red spots all over my skin. I was not sure if these red spots were normal or not because I do have them on occasion however these are darker than normal.

                                                About 6 hours after I recieved the vaccine, I started to feel relatively sick. I had a bad headache and was achy, which I know were listed as possible side effects. A few hours later, I started to have a severe burning sensation all over my body. It felt similar to the sensation when your skin gets extremely sensitive to any touch, but was magnified 10x over, and was over every inch of my body. There was no rash, and I did not have a chill as though I had a fever, although my skin was warm to the touch. I took 2 500 mg tablets of extra-strength Tylenol, and the symptoms did not improve at all.

                                                Around 9pm was very tired with small headache. Went to bed at 10pm and laid there for an hour and a half with my head pounding and burning. I?ve never been able to feel a fever on myself?it was so high. I also had major chills the whole time. I?d get up and hydrate and took 2 Advil around 12:30pm as no sign of sleep was coming. I put ice packs on my hot head for an hour with no relief. Meanwhile my heart rate was steadily above 100 for the whole night until about 4am when my fever went down and I was able to sleep till 7am. I thought I was going to die it was so hot and painful and pounding. In the morning the fever is gone and I am extremely tired. Currently not recommending people get the vaccine.

                                                Headache that evening and that lasted for about two days. Around 11 PM that same night of vaccine - I had chills but no fever. The second and third day I was super fatigued. Everything was okay after that but a week and a half later I was receiving severe stomach pain and a little blood in my stool. That is what brought me to the ER on 23rd when I had the blood in my stool . I had a rash on the back of my thighs  and I had swollen lymph nodes on each side of my neck that started after that. I went to ER again last weekend and that ER was at another location - no tests were done there. They told me to take OTC Tylenol. I still have the swollen lymph nodes and the rash is getting better not completely gone.

My apartment-mate who came with me for the shot laid me down on the floor until I could sit up again without feeling dizzy (~15 min). I also had pretty serious bruising at the injection site for ~9 days following the injection and my arm was swollen and painful (although this is a pretty normal side-effect).

                                                Originally, I started with random muscle aches in my left shoulder then it went down my back (a few hours after receiving vaccine). Then slightly fogginess and at night the muscle pain became worse making it difficult to sleep and started getting cold flashes. Once asleep around 12:30 I started getting muscle aches that felt like they were burning and in random spots on body along with a headache and would get random cold and heat flashes. Kept yelling out in pain all night and increased tremors in hands. Boyfriend noticed I had a fever as well and gave me ibuprofen around 3am since pain was unbearable and was difficult to sleep. Almost took me to the hospital due to the intense pain.. In morning slightly better but still frontal lobe pain and aches throughout body with raised heart rate. Cannot do much or else aches get worse including headache.

Then symptom completely gone over 1-2 days.  She also noticed left face/hip with raised red areas that looked like she had been bitten by ants on 4/2 (day after receiving vaccine).  This rash was gone in one hour and no symptoms since.

                                                My daughter got the shot at 1 pm on the 8th of April, 2021. (My daughter &amp; I both got the shot at the same shot at the same time). By 11:00 pm my daughter started complaining with feeling dizzy. She kept saying she felt like she was going to throw up, meaning she was nauseated. She was complaining with her bones hurting. We both got these symptoms at the same time. We both stayed in and out of the shower letting the shower water just run on us. I had to give her ibuprofen because she complained of a mild headache &amp; the pain all over her body. She couldn?t sleep at all. She cried. It had her scared. I fully believe she?s having an allergic reaction to the Janssen shot. I have fully read the Janssen ?fact sheet?. My daughter was having hot flashes &amp; cold sweats. She has ongoing symptoms &amp; it?s been 2 days since receiving shot including fever. She was having what I thought heart palpitations. We both swelled up causing our bodies to feel tight. We both were healthy before receiving the shot. We?ve never had covid nor tested positive. We are currently going to receive a check up by a doctor. The side effects of this medication is dangerous &amp; doesn?t compare to flu like symptoms.

                                                About 9 hours after receiving the Janssen vaccine on April 9th, I started feeling ill. I had a fever of 102, difficulty walking/moving on my own, intense nausea, numbness in my left arm for about 2 minutes, and I spontaneously got my period (which was very regular up until then). I took Tylenol, went to bed, woke up with a 100 degree fever but feeling much better, and it soon dropped back to 98 degrees.  Today, on April 13th, I started having pain in my left arm and leg. Specifically, in my left bicep (not the injection site) and my left thigh. This pain does not feel like muscle soreness, but almost like a knot? I&#39;m not sure how to describe it, but I find it odd the pain in my arm increases a bit when I walk/move.

After 4 to 5 hours of the vaccine shot in the left arm, the area was swollen, red and painful.   The adverse event  different than reorted one is that the day after, a bruise appears and still in pain.

                                                Several hours after the vaccine I noticed abdominal pain located in my lower back, primarily on the left side. I also had a pounding headache (not a migraine), and other body aches. Over the next several days (Thursday night through Saturday, 4/1-4/3) these symptoms persisted along with mild dehydration and constipation. The aches I treated with ibuprofen, and I used a mild, natural laxative to try to poop. The constipation was relieved by pooping, but it was much less than my normal amount of stool, and it took a couple days to fully abate. I also noticed that I wasn?t sweating very much/at all until about a week after I received the vaccine, which was very worrying. I attempted to drink plenty of water during all of this, though I can?t be sure I succeeded. I think my menstrual period may have happened during this week, maybe starting on the Tuesday falling the vaccine, but cannot remember for sure. Constipation and dehydration are unusual for my period, though the pain is not. There was soreness in my arm muscles around the vaccine site, but it was consistent with what I feel from any other vaccine, and only lasted a day.  All discomfort ceased about a week after the vaccine.

I had body and muscle aches in my full body including neck, back, abdomen area, legs, and arms. I had a headache most of the day. I had the chills throughout the full day and had on and off nausea. I was extremely tired and stayed in bed almost all day. 2 days after the vaccine, all of these symptoms were gone except the injection sight is still slightly tender 4 days later.

I received the vaccine Friday afternoon 3/12, and around midnight that night (so 3/13 technically) I developed flu like symptoms. I had a mild fever, severe body aches, severe headache, nausea, fatigue, etc. For the entire day of 3/13 I was pretty much bed ridden. Around 5pm on the 13th I took Tylenol and felt a little better and was able to eat something and fall asleep that night. I woke up on the 14th with just a sore arm where I received the shot.

                                                Around 10pm on 3/26, I got a slight headache, but I am not sure if it was due to screen time or a vaccine side effect. Per the clinician that administered the shot, I took 2 tabs of Tylenol (one normal adult dose) with water and went to bed. At 1 am on 3/27, I woke up incredibly sore all over but especially in my joints. I was shivering badly and woke up in a tightly curled fetal position. I was unable to lie still or warm up. I eventually went back to sleep and woke up at 5 am, this time with extreme nausea and threw up everything I had eaten the day before. This went on for a couple of minutes. I was still shivering constantly and sore and achy everywhere. Especially in my knees, shoulders, and lower back. At 6 am, I was still awake and while I still had chills, my face felt hot and I took my temperature twice. First getting 100.74 then 100.86. Slept deeply for the rest of the night. At noon on 3/27 I woke up with no nausea,  body aches but only in my joints but with general soreness everywhere (like after a good workout) and a temp still in the 100.7 degree range. I took 2 Tylenol tabs at 2pm. At 4pm, I only had slight body aches, a headache, and a slight brain fog left and my temp was at 98.7, so no more fever. No further problems showed  up and when I woke up at 9 am on 3/28, I felt absolutely fine other than soreness at the injection site and a little chest tightness which last for about 2 days, through 3/30.

I was seen by my primary care doctor, sent pictures to my dermatologist, and went to the Emergency room. The spot was ichy and painful. There was a bruise of different colors. It was spreading and I am going back to the Doctor today. I am on antibiotics for 10 days, taking this doxycycline pill two times daily. Furthermore, every 6 hours I have been taking benadryl and applying ice.

                                                At about 5 hours after receiving the vaccine at around 5 p.m., I developed a pounding headache. As the night continued, if I moved my head at all it would cause severe pain and a pounding headache. Additionally, I experienced shooting pains through my neck and back, I became extremely hot to the touch, yet I felt freezing cold and could not stop shivering. Then I developed severe aching and tingling from the top of my head to the tips of my toes, with excruciating lower back pain and I could feel my heart beating very fast. My entire body was tense and sore. These symptoms did not alleviate for 12 hours and I could not fall asleep due to the discomfort I was in. I finally was able to fall asleep at 6 a.m. after the aching/tingling/pain/hotness subsided (about 12 hours after side effects started).

Started feeling muscle fatigue around 4pm, with upper body aches, stinging eyes, and nausea by 6pm. Fever of 102, and progression to full body aches and headache by 8pm in addition to the aforementioned symptoms that continued throughout the night. Fever lowered to 99 and only minor body aches by mid morning on the 12th. Headache continued throughout the day with low grade fever. I predict that I will feel 100% better within 48 hours.

The area was also red and swollen, with a &#34;hard lump&#34; underneath that is painful to touch. Affected area also felt hot. After a week since injection, the skin around the adverse area became dry, with mild skin flakes forming. The bruise and pain growing as time went on.   At home treatment included an ice pack for 15-20 minutes daily for 2 days. 1,000 mg of over the counter Tylenol Acetaminophen daily for 4 days.  Adverse effect ended after 10 days since injection date. Currently only a very mild pain when lifting right arm up. Area no longer is painful to touch.

                                                The day of vaccination and day after I was suffering from very severe head aches that caused me to not be able to look at screens or light during that time. I noticed on Sunday I began developing some redness on the tops of my hands. On Monday morning my hands began getting a rash on the knuckles and tops of my hands. I also noticed that since being vaccinated my nipples have been erect and are tender. Today my hands are no longer displaying a redness to them but they are still itchy and the skin feels dry like Eczema, something I never have had before in my life.

                                                I received my vaccine April 11th at 3 p.m and began to have a fever around 9 p.m.  My fever did not go away until the next evening. On April 12th I had a fever and woke up with red little dots around my eyes.  At night the fever went away. The following day April 13th I felt my chest tight and had shortness of breath throughout the day. I also had stomach pains at times.  April 14th and 15th (today) my chest still feels tight and I get tired very easily.  My arm is also still very sore and sensitive, I have a little bump where the vaccine was put in.

                                                Immediately after receiving the shot I began to have fairly intense pain at injection site. It continued in waves. I began to walk around the store for the allotted 15 minutes. I began to feel very dizzy and faint. My ears began ringing and I didn?t feel well. I stumbled back to the pharmacy to ask for help. At this point I was also feeling like it was very hard to breathe. I explained all these symptoms to the pharmacists on duty and they told me to just sit down. After sitting down I still felt faint but suddenly felt the need to vomit. I stumbled to the bathroom where I collapsed in front of the toilet and passed out twice, striking my head and throat on the bowl. After awaking I was very disoriented and felt very hot and clammy. The pharmacist then came and found me and told me to once again sit down and continue waiting. After sitting down for about 5 more minutes I began to feel less dizzy and was having an easier time breathing. I left the store as the pharmacist was ignoring me and didn?t seem concerned about my symptoms. After arriving home I was tired and week and very very cold. I noted my body temp was lower than usual. I took a nap and then these symptoms continued for about 24 hours. I am now feeling much better.

                                                I had a red, hard, spot on my arm that lasted over two weeks. I also had a bruise that was changing colors.  My arm was painful and the redness was spreading. I was given antibiotics for ten days afterwards. My mother also had a rash at the injection site, and was given same shot as me on same day. The lot number for my shot is 1808609. I have many pictures of the reaction if you want me to upload. Furthermore, the doctor said that my reaction would be aligned with a &#34;moderna&#34; reaction but is NOT typical of a J and J reaction (which is the shot that I had received and obtained a record of receiving from the Pharmacy).  I got an ultrasound and blood test around two weeks after vaccine, no blood clot found.

I started getting the sweats. After sitting for a few minutes, I tried to stand up and was very dizzy again. I immediately sat back down as I thought I was going to pass out. 30 minutes later, I had a nasty headache, the chills, pain in my knees and lower back, and neck pain. Also, I had pain at the site of the injection. I felt very nauseous. These symptoms persisted from hour 8 to 44 hours after receiving the shot.

I had a fever of 99.9 and had a headache across the front of the face and nauesa. All of this lasted together for about 6 to 7 hours. During this time I took Tyenol, used cold compress, wrapped up in blankets and sipped on water. After the chills and hot flashes subsided I continued to feel fatigue,and had  head and body aches for the next 18-24 hours. During this time I continued with Tyenol and fluids. In all it last about 36 hours before I felt like myself again.

                                                At around 9:15 PM I started to feel nauseous and got out of bed to go to the bathroom. While using the bathroom I felt a very strong chill come over my whole body and started shivering and got directly back into bed and wrapped myself up in a thick blanket. For 45 minutes I laid wrapped up and was shivering constantly. At 10 pm I was brought extra blankets and a heating pad but moving to get situated caused dizziness. It was about 10:30 when the shivering stopped. I was able to sleep but got up to go got the bathroom around midnight and my entire body was drained of energy and I felt that I could barely stand and walk on my own. I was dizzy and my head hurt as well. I could barely hold my arms up to look at my phone briefly. Between 11 PM and 2 AM I had 5 or 6 high heart rate alerts (over 120) according to my Apple Watch but I did not wake up to them. In the morning (Sunday 4/4/21) around 9-10 am my head still hurt and my body was very achy and I felt very hungover. All day I continued to feel achy almost with a bad cold or a minor flu. Today has been better but I have still felt pretty drained. I?ve had continuous arm soreness in the arm I got the injection - but nothing too severe.   15 minutes after my vaccine on Saturday 4/3/21 I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and around midnight of that night I took 2 of pain relief PM acetaminophen (1000 mg of acetaminophen total snd 50 mg of diphenhydramine HCI total)

Then I started feeling cold chills, and had to lie down in bed for the rest of the day.  Slight fever also occured and intense body aches. However, these slowly subsided after taking tylenol at about 6PM. I slept through the night and outside of feeling a little lethargic the next day, I was back to normal.

                                                Patient received her Janssen COVID vaccine and was sitting in a chair in the conference room when she slumped over in her chair and became unresponsive. Patient had just received her one dose Janssen vaccine and was sitting in a chair approximately 3-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  She began to slump over in her chair and was unresponsive. Two RNs responded to assess the patient. Patients feet were elevated and ice packs applied to her neck and axillary areas. Patient was breathing and had a pulse. Patient responded to her name once and then passed out again. Patient was unable to respond after this.  Her eyes were open.  Patient was lifted into a wheelchair by three nurses and brought to a private area.  Patient was warm and sweat was running down her face.  Her sweater was removed and ice packs again were applied to her neck and axillary area.  Patient continued to have a pulse and was breathing.  EMS was called.  Patient slowly began to come around and could answer questions after about 5 minutes of being unresponsive. She was confused and had no memory of what had occurred. She reported feeling light headed and seeing spots in her vision.  She continued to feel light headed. EMS assessed patient.  Vitals were stable and blood sugar was WDL.  Patient reported feeling much better. She denied feeling light headed or dizzy any longer.  She was able to answer all questions asked.  Patient did not want to go to the hospital and refused transport to the hospital via ambulance. She was observed for an additional 20-30 minutes at which time her boss arrived to pick her up. She was educated on calling 911 if she began to feel light headed or dizzy again. Patient verbalized understanding. She was walked to the car by an RN.

                                                Initial injection was recieved with arm extended out and raised in car window. Really painful injection. Several seconds after vaccine injected I felt a wave of chills on my body and immediately started profusely sweating. Seconds after that i then began to get extremely dizzy, blacking out, trying to stay conscious for a personnel to walk by and after a few moments the feeling slowly lightened up minus the excessive sweating and chills. Personnel then told me it was just anxiety and brushed it off. I have never had a reaction like this from a vaccine before so this experience was unsettling.

                                                First day there was a red line going under the site an hour after injection. 2-4 th day there was bruising, swelling, warm to the touch, and a red area underneath the injection site. Visited a MD (seeked out help after results worsening) and he stated it was due to a vessel being punctured  during  injection (not due to vaccine) which caused the bruising  at the site and the redness/swelling is due to the vaccine.  It?s on day four now and the bruising is healing but the redness and swelling is still consistent. MD cleared me of no infection but stated if redness grows (or fevers) to seek out help again.

                                                At around 10:30 AM on 3/29/2021, I began to notice some irritation and phlegm build up in my throat, as well as some tingling and numbness in my face. This lasted for approximately 30 minutes before subsiding. At around 8:00 PM on 3/29/2021, I began developing a fever and somewhat severe body aches that lasted until the morning of 3/31/2021. I also developed a somewhat severe headache on the morning of 3/31/2021 that lasted through 4/1/2021. The injection site was tender to the touch from the evening of 3/29/2021 until 4/2/2021, and my arm was also very sore during this same time frame. I also noticed unusual exhaustion from the evening of 3/29/2021 until 4/5/2021. During 3/29/2021-4/1/2021, I was taking Tylenol Extra Strength (1 pill every 6 hours or so) to help alleviate symptoms, but it only helped for about 3 hours in the 6 hour interval.

                                                Got the shot at 9:20am on Saturday (April 10th). By the time I sat down to do the 15min waiting period before I could leave. My arm from the back of my shoulder all the way down to around my thumb joint in my hand ached so bad. By around 3pm on the same day, I started to feel really tired and had a pounding migraine. By 4:30p I started to get really cold and everything started to ache. By 6p I was feeling hot but at the same time cold and shivering. My head was pounding. Every muscle ached all over my body, and by every muscle I mean even my eye muscles and pelvic floor muscles. My face had so much sinus pressure that it felt like it could explode. My skin, all over my body, was so sensitive that it hurt to the touch. On top of my skin being sensitive to the touch, off and on my skin would tingle, including the inside of my mouth and tongue. My lymph nodes were swollen enough in my neck that my throat ached.  I was mentally confused and shaking. Everything got bad enough I started crying and hyperventilating. I felt sick to my stomach and felt digestive pain. My entire body felt so heavy. By the time it got to around 8p, my mom finally took my temperature, which at that point I had already been taking Tylenol all day and was no longer shivering, and I had a temperature of 101 degrees F. I finally went to bed around 9p. I was thirsty but my stomach felt sick. I still ached and woke up around 10 times throughout the night either feeling too hot or cold or hurting so bad. At 4am I took a Tylenol because it everything hurt bad enough to able to fall asleep. The next day. I mostly better. I was still tired and a little achy and my lymph nodes under my arm pits were swollen. At this point my lungs felt strange. Harder to breathe than normal.  I was starting to cough. The day after that (today) I have felt fairly normal except I?m coughing and my lungs still feel a little strained. No more aches or fever or anything like that though.

Then, I felt nauseous and vomited. After vomiting I could not move and I had very hard time walking. I noticed that my face had swollen, my throat was closing, and my vision was blurry. I also broke out in hives. Once I could get mobile (about two hours after the adverse reaction started) I took a Benadryl and that helped ease the swelling.

                                                The night I got the vaccine 3/10 my arm was sore just like any other vaccine I?ve received. Two days later, I woke up and noticed a welt on my arm that was about two inches in diameter. It was itchy and painful. I could not lift my arms up. By noon it had doubled, and the slightest touch was unbearable. The ?Covid arm? was also hot in temperature. That night, it was at its worst at 5 inches in diameter and it was even more swollen. It stayed that way for three more days before it started to go down. A week after my vaccine a bruise developed where the welt was. Two weeks after my vaccination it was still bruised and swollen. It felt like a tide pod when I touched it. My mom encouraged me to go to urgent care. So on 3/26/21, I went to urgent care and was told it was a cyst. My arm is currently still squishy at the welt and bruised. I have an appointment on 4/19 at my dermatologist for further care.

                                                Itch started around stomach area, first thought it was a bug bite. Eventually hives started spreading all over the chest, back, under the arms, thighs, and now my hands and neck. Was not sure if this was caused by the vaccine until 5/1. Found out that this was a rare non-severe symptom, and  that&#39;s when I started taking allergy meds (Benadryl) for Antihistamines and it has relieved the itch temporary. Does not stop the spread of the itchiness.

                                                I woke up noticing a slight headache, but I figured it was from poor sleep the night prior. I noticed after breakfast that I felt really cold and felt an internal shiver, especially in my chest. My fingers and toes were ice cold even with a sweater, blanket, and a warm tea. I noticed my skin starting to feel tender and I felt very fatigued. I wanted knew I needed to eat so that I could take ibuprofen, but I experienced a loss of appetite. I had a mild cough, but I felt too tired to even cough. I rocked in a chair in the sunlight outside for about 15 minutes and still felt cold. When I took my oral temperature after coming inside, I was reading 99.9. I took 400mg of Ibuprofen by 1130 and layed down to rest. Bundled in 3 layers, I felt the shivering couldn&#39;t stop. My headache got worse and my skin was tender to the touch. I was able to sleep for approximately 3 hours and I woke up drenched in sweat. I took my oral temperature again and was at 101.1. I drank some more water and tried to sleep some more. When I woke up around 4:30 pm, I felt a lot better. My temperature went down to 97.8 and I had a boost in energy and appetite. I no longer had a headache and I had only mild muscle aches. By the next morning, I felt completely normal again.

                                                Approximately 7 hours after receiving the single dose of the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine,  symptoms such as muscle aches, fatigue, and fever set in. Symptoms rapidly worsened over the next few hours, with the fever reaching a max temp of 103 degrees Fahrenheit. This required monitoring and the use of ice packs to keep the fever under control. Muscle aches were severe, and were particularly prominent in the lower back region and the injection site. Fever remained in the 100-103 degree range for the duration of the night and by the next day, temperature returned to around 98 degrees.

                                                I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine at 8:30AM on Friday, March 26. The only symptoms I experienced until that evening were mild soreness at the injection site, mild stiffness/soreness in my left arm and my neck, and mild body aches. At 6:00PM that day, I was driving and experienced sudden-onset nausea and dizziness. I experienced tunnel vision and my vision began to black out. I was able to pull off the road and began retching and dry heaving. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my lips and then in my right hand, each of which lasted for about a minute. The nausea lasted for 5-10 minutes, after which it dissipated and I started experiencing chills. After returning home, around 9:30PM I experienced a severe headache and a return of sudden-onset nausea. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my right hand again, which disappeared after about 5 minutes. I retched and dry heaved again, and I took two Advil. The nausea passed and I was able to go back to sleep. The next morning, the nausea had completely disappeared,  and the only lingering symptoms were a mild headache and mild stiffness/body aches.

Approximately 5 hours after recieving the vaccine I started feeling extremely tired and cold despite the climate being warmer than usual. I went to sleep and woke up shivering, i was cold but my body was burning to the touch. My body ached and I had a headache and nausea. My eyes hurt whenever I moved them. These symptoms persisted until 9:18, I took 2 tylenol pills and started feeling better. Today is my third day, my eye pain has not gone and I still feel tired but what is bothering the most is the eye pain whenever I look anywhere or move my head.

I felt foggy and &#34;off&#34; at this time, like my head isn&#39;t clear. There has also been constant aching at the site of injection in my left arm.

                                                Arm was sore in injection site immediately after injection and has remained sore. Started getting a headache around 6/7pm. Headache got worse and started getting muscle aches all over body around 8/9pm. Skin was very sensitive and tender to the touch (eg touching my arm or brushing up against something). Fever started around 9pm, went up to 101.4°F. Had chills. Trouble sleeping. Now 7:30am the next day and still have body aches and severe headache, but don?t feel as feverish.  Finally took 2 extra strength Tylenol tablets around 7:30am so hopefully that will help.

Fever lasted approximately 12 hours, and included heavy chills and sweating. Extreme fatigue, weakness, and dizziness. Metallic taste in mouth. Body aches, and especially soreness in the left arm (injection site). Loss of appetite. By 24 hours after the vaccine injection, almost all symptoms were gone, but soreness in left arm persisted. About 26 hours after the vaccine, I had extreme acid reflux which lasted a few hours. In the two days since the vaccine I&#39;ve experienced a ringing in my left ear.

At approximately 3:30 p.m. that same day of the shot that I received, I started experiencing flu like symptoms such as severe aches throughout my body and hot flashes. My body was also significantly shaking as I would randomly become very cold and achy when I wasn?t having hot flashes. I also had a severe headache. Slight pain on the injection site, but not horrible. The day after the shot, I feel weak and nauseous.

                                                Around 6pm I started to get a really bad headache and all I wanted to do was lay down because I was getting very tired. About an hour later my entire body was aching and I couldn&#39;t stop shaking with chills. I couldn&#39;t move or turn in my bed without my entire body just hurting. Even the blankets and clothes I had on were hurting my body. I tossed and turned throughout the night. At midnight I woke up to use the bathroom and my face and eyes were hurting. Once I got into my bathroom and looked in the mirror, my face was a little swollen and my eyes were a little puffy. My forehead and cheeks were a little red so I took my temperature and I was running a fever of 102.

                                                On the evening of 4-18-2021, I noticed the palms of my hands and feet were extremely itchy. Lotion did not relieve the itch I eventually put ice on them so I was able to sleep.   I woke up 4-19-2021 and felt itchy all over but no noticeable rash. I took my last antibiotic pill around 9 am. By 2:00pm I started getting small ?hives? on my arms. By 4pm my arms were covered and my chest and neck had began to break out.   By the time I reach the urgent care (4:45pm) my back and stomach, and upper legs had become affected also. I received a steroid shot in the muscle of my buttocks.   I got home around 6pm and put cool towels on my legs and eventually the rash was almost completely gone.    I woke up 4/20 around 6am with the chills and goosebumps all over feeling cold, but sweating like crazy. The rash/hives had came back and even worse/covering more of my body than before.  I am now taking  Prednisone 2x per day for the next 7days  starting 4/20 11am
