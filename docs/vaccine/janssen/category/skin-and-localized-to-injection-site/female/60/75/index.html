                                                The patient received Janssen COVID vaccine on 3/6 to RIGHT deltoid. She has a past medical history significant for LEFT sided breast cancer, treated with lumpectomy and radiation ~5 yrs prior. Remains on Letrozole. 1 day post-vaccine, she developed fevers (tmax 104), chills, malaise. 2 days post-vaccine, the fevers, chills, malaise dissipated but she developed a &#34;rash&#34; to her LEFT breast (same site as prior malignancy). This rash became a widespread erythematous area encompassing her entire breast. Axilla excluded.  No palpable lymphadenopathy. She reports area to be tender and itching. Rash is blanchable. It is somewhat response to OTC antihistamines (Claritin/Benadryl) and OTC hydrocortisone. She has no respiratory distress, lingering fever, or other allergic reactions. She was given a prescription topical steroid (triamcinolone) and will follow up with her in a few days, if she remains stable. If not back to baseline within the week, will obtain breast MRI for further evaluation.

Most of the hives are on the torso, more severe on the front and some on the back.  A few have been on my arms.  After going back to sleep, the hives are gone when get up for the day.  No hives during the day.  Then awakened by hives again at 4am or 5am.  Prior to receiving the one-dose Janseen COVID-19 vaccine,  had only experienced hives three times in my life, several years apart.  Now it has occurred early every morning seven times in a row and expect it will happen again, since the ones this morning were worse than the previous few times.

                                                severe chills, exhaustion, nausea, constipation, urinary discomfort, odor in urine - most symptoms lasted until Tuesday 3/16. However, that evening I developed a red bumpy itchy rash on both my legs (front only from knee to upper thigh). I took a Benedryl and it was gone this morning. The discomfort while urinating has returned this morning 3/17 and my primary doctor is sending me for lab work.

                                                Headache and neck stiffness within 15 minutes of vaccine and lasted for a couple days.  The days after vaccine I had extreme tiredness and felt like I had a bad cold with a lot of coughing and shortness of breath.  I was coughing up a lot of mucus.  The cold like symptoms are still ongoing, 2 weeks after the vaccine, but are less extreme.  8 days after the vaccine I started to have pain at the injection site.  My upper hurt if I touched it.  Twelve days after the vaccine my upper arm hurts if I raise my arm and if I shake my inhalers to use them.  This seems like a muscle pain from the injection site to my shoulder.

                                                I noticed a rash on my right upper arm.  At first it was small bumps (no color) &amp; didn&#39;t itch.  After a few days the bumps got larger &amp; started to itch.  They also appear to be turning red in color &amp; possibly spreading.  I have been putting anti-itch cream (Benadryl) on them twice a day.  I didn&#39;t think much of it @ first since I got the vaccine in my left arm.  With the weather being cold, I have only been wearing long sleeve shirts.  I have not changed my laundry or shower soap either.

The pinpoint soreness was vague and lingering until the middle of the night last night when the intense pain woke me from my sleep.  It isn&#39;t bursa pain it is deltoid pain more intense than I ever imagined it could be especially at the two week mark post vaccine!! It is pretty terrible.

                                                I am covered in a severe rash that itches burns and tingles. First RX was a 4mg prednisone pack that did not help from an urgent care facility. I then went to Dr who gave me RX and the next day it was worse again so the current RX is described earlier. It is not getting any worse but I am struggling to not itch. I can not wear clothes for long periods of time and it is quite debilitating  Clothes

                                                Shot immediately started stinging.  My upper arm swelled with a hard ridge about 3 inches long and 1 inch wide.  Extremely painful.  Could barely raise my arm and could not sleep on that side or tolerate even soft touch of my entire upper arm.  No other reaction that seemed like an allergic response.  I did get very sick for 2 days with severe flu symptoms and strange shooting pains in random parts of my body.  Enough pain to wake me from a sound sleep.  Bad chills, but no fever. I did. I give my legs seemed swollen for about 3 days.   I got the J&amp;J vaccine on 3-6-21 and my arm is still swollen with a slightly smaller hard and painful ridge at the injection site and it sometimes throbs and itches severely.  Today is 4-2-21.  Starting to wonder if it will ever go away.  I still cannot sleep on that side.  The pain overall is less, but it still throbs and itches periodically throughout the day.

Significant headache presented in front and sides of head (near temples), beginning day 1 after injection, with duration of 4 days. 3. Fatigue presented on day 1 after injection, duration of 4 days. 4. Mental health symptoms after day 1, with duration of 5 days, presenting as feelings of sadness and depressive ideation.   The last symptom (#4) is difficult for me to correlate specifically to the vaccination, as I am a 60 year-old and in my first year in a rigorous doctoral program at a hospital. The negative physical symptoms experienced by the injection could have added an extra layer to the sadness that I reported from the daily app check-ins. I already operate (since fall 2020) in an overwhelmed state (while beginning a difficult academic program via Zoom). Could the physical fatigue and headaches from the vaccine lead to the feelings of sadness? Or were the feelings of sadness a third symptom of the vaccine? I cannot answer, and therefore cannot provide this correlation link with any reliability.  I did speak to my therapist via Zoom, and reached out via email to my general physician (who recommended OTC meds.

I got in my car to go home from a friends house and started severe chills and called Doctor for fear of heart attack. They told me to go to ER. I continued driving home. Chills got worse. I got in shower with heater on and chills persisted. Drank coconut water and heart palpitations resided.  Got in bed and fever spiked to 102 and every bone was inflamed in pain. Nyquil did nothing. After a few hours of severe and unbearable pain I called ER. Headed over to ER at 3:00 a.m. and sat in parking lot. Fever broke at 3:00 a.m. which was hour 14 after vaccine. Other than severe nausea, pain calmed down. Drove home with Tylenol. Took 1,000 mg and finally rested at 4:00 a.m. Woke up at 8:00 a.m. with nausea but pain gone. 24 hours from vaccine, most of the reaction gone. 48 hours out body normal but pain in injection site.

                                                Chills and low grade fever, then within another hour felt light-headed and my body hurt all over - skin was sensitive to even my clothes.  Headache started in the front of my forehead by late evening, and I literally couldn&#39;t even walk up to my bed.  Restless sleeping with all the sweating and chills.  Woke up with headache remaining and feeling very &#34;wiped out&#34; and still light-headed.  No more chills or sweats the next day, but I was weak for about 48 hours.  Honestly - I&#39;m very healthy and getting Covid directly from another person couldn&#39;t have been worse than getting  the vaccine.  :(   And I am even saying that as a 35 year professional Research Scientist.

                                                Was doing CDC TEXT tracing first week after injection, but new reactions started after tracking completed. Had mild reactions originally. Pain in arm, and fever next day that rose to 100.9. No chills, no major problems, no rash. A couple nose bleeds on second day which were not typical for me. Returned to work on third day. Now on day 10 I&#39;m convinced I&#39;m having a delayed reaction. Still mild but present. Low temp 99.5, headache, fatigue, feeling of not being normal. Not allowed to work today. Reason for report of such mild symptoms is my surprise of this delayed reaction 10 days later. There is a bruise on my injection arm now, opposite side of arm, that also is puzzling, but not really worrisome. Know to monitor for platelet issues.

                                                I got an itchy rash on my right leg within the first 15 minutes, staff at the site tried to get me to belief it was from anxiety. The redness subsided though bumps remained when they let me go home. I also felt a bit &#34;detached&#34; on the drive home and really had to concentrate on my driving. Once home, I still felt odd but went about my day. About four hours later, I realized I was scratching my stomach and chest while watching TV. Upon raising my shirt, I saw a bright red rash on the top part of my belly that extended underneath both breasts and to the area directly over my heart, and up my left side into my left armpit. All of these areas were very itchy. I put Hydrocortisone cream on them, which helped reduce the itching quite quickly. I then took half a Benadryl tablet. When I awoke the next morning, the areas that had been bright red now had dark red dots but did not itch. However, I had lines of a bright red, itchy rash on both thighs near my groin. I again applied Hydrocortisone cream and took Benadryl, which helped abate the symptoms. Lymph nodes in my left armpit were quite sore as well, so I took ibuprofen.

                                                Started on Monday morning at 8:30 am started feeling cold chills.  Took 800mg of Ibuprofen and after an hour felt better.  When going to bed around 9:00pm I noticed that my skin was soaking wet and that I had a hot feeling.  When I woke up in the morning  (tuesday April 13, 2021) around 7am I could not fully open my eyes.  I looked in the mirror and noticed that my entire face was swollen and was red in different areas.   I took some benadryl as I thought this was an allergic reaction and went back to bed.  A litter later I started getting cold chills and then hot flashes.   Around noon time I took another benadryl.  By 2:30 I was not feeling any better and I also had body aches and pains and called my doctor.  I was able to get in to the office.  I was told that I was having a reaction to the shot and that I was boarder line for the hospital.  They gave me a shot steriod shot and prescribed Metheylprednisolon tablets (24) to be taken as directed and to continue to take benadryl.   It&#39;s now Wednesday morning April 14, 2020 and the swelling has gone down but not fully gone and I have stated on the prescription.  I now have redness in my chest area.  I still have a some chills and hot flashes.

                                                I took 1 Benandryl about 1 hour before the injection of the vaccine prior to leaving my home.  My son took me as I would anticipate some type of reaction given my history.  J&amp;J was the one my doctor recommended in hopes that I could handle the response better and only need 1 dose. I had options to get pfizer or moderna, but my dr wanted J&amp;J so I waited several weeks longer to get this one.  Within 10 minutes of having the injection, my  ears swelled up, and felt like I was on a bad plane and could not burst clear.  Then my throat on left side, the same side I got the shot swelled.  My face was full of red and rash and my son mentioned he was concerned how I looked.  I told him my symptoms and then took another Benadryl before we left the store. I told the pharmacist that I was having a reaction, they wanted to call 911-I said please no. I am used to having reactions and would want to see if I can manage it with Benadryl at home.  I came home and took my Alegra (as I take my alegra at night before bed to help with congestion).  Going forward every 2-3 hours I would take another benadryl rotating the time frames and slept as much as possible. It took several hours for the swelling to subside, longer than I was used to.  Over the next several days, I would have times when my ears, throat would swell, my face would be red and rashed, especially at night my face will get red, rash and ears and throat swell late at night. It waxes and wains depending on how I feel.   After the main allergic reaction of 12-24 hours later, I stared with the COVID symptoms, fever, chills, body ache, the joints that I have trouble with hurt so much more (knee, foot, arms, hands) I was so thankful I did not catch COVID. I don&#39;t think I would have survived. On Friday, March 19, 2021 was the first day I started to feel better except for the late night episodes of allergic reaction. I take Alegra or when needed Benadryl. It seems to lower my swelling response.

                                                I experienced after my J&amp;J vaccine headaches for two days. Then on 04-16-2021 upon waking up I had a red rash which was warm, hot sensation when touching my arm. This hot sensation radiated up to my neck, trachea and down my forearm. I got concerned about the red rash and because I felt my arm hot sensation and I went to see my doctor who asked me if I had trouble breathing or if I had any chest pain. I told him I could breathe and I was concerned about my rash. He prescribed Prednisone medication which I took several days to go away. To this day I still continue with the headaches that come and go and I take 2 acetaminophen to relieve the pain. I do not know if my headaches are related to the J&amp;J vaccine and the rash  has gone away.

                                                I am filling out this report today because I received a follow up call from the website because I had reported loss work, loss of job, loss of activity and visits to doctors. I received the vaccine on March 12, 2021, I started having arm and shoulders symptoms the day after getting the vaccine but did not feel well that first night while trying to sleep. The symptoms worsened every day, I am in week 11 post vaccination. I have had 22 medical appointments with 3 to PCP, 13 to Physical Therapy who diagnosed left bicep tendinitis and shoulder impingement many weeks ago, 4 to acupuncture, and 1 to xray. This Thursday I finally get an MRI. I lost my job on week 7 after the vaccine, I can barely use my left arm, I live alone, I am exhausted and spend much time chasing a diagnosis or help in resolving this issue. I reported to website every time the link was sent to me. I called the Pharmacy on Day 3 and called Janssen hotline on Day 3 to report a reaction. I wrote to my doctor on Day 5 to say something was not right. By the next day I had an injection site reaction, very hard swelling in my arm, a dark red jagged surface reaction at the injection site now there is a divot there. Feeling very unwell, aches and pains, no fever. I had bad abdominal cramps that night after the injection, diarrhea for days, arm pain with swelling, joint pain in shoulder, knee, and fingers, and a  rash across my back, I had to continue to work, typing fast 9 to 10 hours a day, I am a self-employed contractor doing tax technical support and the pain in my arm grew worse daily, I was in tears trying to work. Sitting to type, to read, to drive is the worse. I can dictate into my devices but not rapidly enough for the level of my work. The worse pain in my arm and shoulder is less by avoiding typing and driving  but the injury is still there. The pain is constant even without movement.

The shot location in my left arm itched a lot. I scratched it, it bled. It became a large hole. 3 days later approximately, I start feeling very very tired. It got progressively worse . I then developed &#34; brain fog&#34;. I have barely been able to work since then.. I believe I started to recover yesterday but not completely sure yet. I also developed a painful tumor in my right arm pit that lasted for a few days. It has since gone away. It was approximately 3/4 &#34; in size. It developed overnight.

(it has been months)  Then she had itching all over.  She took a shower and then noticed she had a bump on chest, then on her arms, and her both legs, stomach, back, and breast.  These bumps appear like little blisters and then burst and scar her skin like a cigarette burn.  Most are small but there are some larger ones.  She says like look the measles.  She went to her PCP Dr.   She was told she was having a reaction to the vaccine and to come back if it got worse.  Pt will reach back out to her doctor for medical advice.

                                                My big toes began hurting really bad. They got hot and reddish. They hurt for about an entire day. I put fungi with extra tea tree oil. That calmed it down. The right foot pain and discoloration completely stopped. On the left foot went to a reddish purple to an opal color. It then varied to a reddish purple again. It is discolored in my toenail. It lightens and gets darker. The pain and discoloration went on for about a week. The pain is gone but the discoloration is still present. The Tuesday after mother&#39;s day I cut my finger and received stitches. Along with the stiches I also received a tetanus shot. I received the tetanus shot in my right arm but I developed a painful knot in both my COVID arm and my tetanus arm. I put neosporin and a bandaid and massaged them which helped. The knots are going away but they haven&#39;t completely disappeared.

Then a few days later  I got a purple line on my right calf that was painful.  The next day I had 3 big yellow spots on the same leg. They went away in 2 days which I thought was odd.  Next day I got a very large bruise at the vaccine location.    After that I started with pains in all of my joints.  Ever since then I have been having pains in all my joints.  The pain level is not going away and has been getting worse

It was a rash then the rash turned into these big red mass, these lumps were nasty and I could not sleep for three days. They were on my arms and legs, stomach, back, parts of my face. The rash went away and came back, was on different parts of my body. I went to the ER to get checked out but at the ER they did not do any exams for me, they just told me I had hives. It took 4-5 days for my hives to go away.  I still get these little bumps, they are small growing around my back, chest and legs and at the bottom of my legs and body and they do not itch.

Round, hard lump (chick pea size) developed at injection site a week or so after injection.  Lump faded over 3-4 weeks.  Left a quarter size indentation about 1/4 inch deep.  My primary physician said there is muscle atrophy and the chemicals in the injection likely killed muscle cells.  Left arm is slightly sore.

Twenty minutes after shot, felt skin flush pass over me and was directed to private area where paramedic took blood pressure and checked for hives. No hives but bumpy skin. Blood pressure spiked to 186/75. No history of such high blood pressure. Waited a while and blood pressure went down, flush and skin bumps subsided, and I went home. Blood pressure erratic in evening but never as high. Next day pulse higher than normal. Took homeopathic remedy. Pulse slowed down a bit. Better by next day.

                                                The day after I took the vaccine I awaken with a terrible headache and remained in bed all day.  The next day I noticed a goose egg shape on my left arm in the area of the vaccine site, with soreness in my arm and shoulder throughout the entire week.   Called the pharmacy who suggested I complete the form online and contact the doctor.  Called the nurse line.

The redness and heat on cheeks intensified through out the night and into the next day. Called my primary care doctor who recommended Zyrtec which eased symptoms.  After 48 hours symptoms had mostly subsided.

Woke on Friday  3/19/21 with fatigue and diarrhea with body aches.  Woke Saturday 3/20/21 with fever 101.7. (During this duration to include today I have  taken Tylenol rotating with Motrin every 2 hours, this never broke my fevers). Fever continues on and off with body aches, nausea, the worst headache I have ever experienced and pain in the base back of my neck L side.  These symptoms have continued since Saturday.  It is now Friday, 3/26/21.  I will say that during waking hours 8am - 10pm on Wednesday 3/24/21 and Thursday 3/25/21 I had no symptoms except absolute fatigue.  The fever returned on those two nights at around midnight with it breaking about 4 am, waking up in a pile of sweat.

Day 5 very tired despite adequate sleep. Mild diarrhea. Symptoms not bad enough to keep me home from work, but I thought it odd symptoms didn&#39;t begin to appear until 4 days after vaccine.

In the morning it seemed getting better but then my symptoms got worse.  I took two Ibuprofen which helped. I still continued to feel tired. After my vaccine, I also got a weird taste in my mouth. I was very tired over the weekend. My armpit itched and so I scratched it and I felt raised bumps under my armpit, under the pit of my arms on both sides, right greater than left. My left arm was the one vaccinated. I also had bad diarrhea on 03-29-2021. Today I still continue with the rash under my armpits and still feel very tired and fatigued.

More patches developed over March 27, 28, and 29th.I self treated using Benadryl, Pepcid, cortisone cream and memetasone furoate cream.  On March 27 at about 6pm I was able to secure a doctors appointment for March 29th.  At the appointment I was given the regiment of one Claritin tablet in am, one 20 mg Pepcid in pm,  Hydroxyzine  25mg at bedtime and to continue use of memetasone cream as needed.  Rash has resolved. Still using meds as I felt itchy yesterday

There was no color change in the skin, neither difficulty to make movement of the arm in any direction. After a day and a half the symptoms disappeared. It was not necessary to take medication for the pain only the application of ice compress symptoms improved

                                                Immediate pain at injection, stinging sensation. Lasted for another 20 to 30 minutes off and on. Tingling and numbness of right arm for short periods after shot off and on for about first 15-20 minutes. Slight dizziness for first 15 -20 minutes lasting short periods. Nausea, briefly twice in first 20 minutes. Light-headed for the duration of 30 minute wait-and-watch period. This was the most noticeable for me, besides the intense stinging sensation in my arm. After 30 minutes of being watched in common area, I stood up to leave with my adult children and my legs were wobbly. The nurses made me sit and stay a while longer and brought me a snack. I drank my water I had brought with me. Left after an additional 15 minutes.

                                                Intense pain, hot from injection site, down entire arm immediately after given.  Continued pain after two days into two weeks, shooting pains , crawling at injection site,and throbbing, even at elbow and wrist.  Arm was also very weak, and still gets tired and throbs .  Has been 4 weeks this week-end . Reported to nurse who tod me to see my Dr. which I did this week.  No redness at injection site, just soreness, know something was off, according to side effects.   Very tired feeling, still, and had some flushed color the first week in my face and like heat flashes for two weeks.    Hope to get the normal feeling back in my arm.  Not sure ?   Maybe a nerve was nicked?  But was not like a Bee Sting like tech described it would feel like that day.  Had a ruff start.

This has never happened to me in 61 years, so I&#39;m very sure this is related to the shot. Prior to that, I had run a fever, and had my whole upper arm swollen and hot , which have both just started to subside.

Left ring finger went numb, white and cold, with bruise appearing on the middle digit. Other finger tips turned pink. Skin turned red onhands with tingling sentation. Right hand blood vessels came to the surface and began to swell at intersections. Skin on rt. hand looked whiter and dry. The sudden onset sent me to the emergency room, the condition began to fade in 3 hours, not completely. The same reaction occured the next day at 12 noon. I took a hot shower and the condition improved followed by extreme tiredness. *At the time of vaccination, &amp; on both of these events I had a stiff neck/red skin.

                                                9 hours later began feeling a general &#34;ick&#34; like when coming down with something, then moderate headache and body aches, especially my back. This lasted less than 2 days.  Other things, mostly starting 5 or 6 days later and some cropping up as late as 4/11.    Random itchy red rashes on each shoulder and back of upper arm that would go away within an hour or 2.   Itching and possibly bumps on buttocks and thighs.  Intensely itching palms for a little while on 2 or 3 different days.  Sudden appearance of a 4 x 4 inch patch of 15-20 bumps of various sizes in the crook of my left elbow (injection arm) with bright red skin. These looked similar to mosquito bites or blisters but didn&#39;t itch. It completely disappeared without a trace within an hour.    Tingling tongue followed by tongue swelling on 4/6/21.  I had eaten my bran flakes with some rice pudding a little bit before this, both of which I&#39;d eaten every day for the past week or so and had had several times in the past. On the advice of my doctor&#39;s nurse, my husband drove me to an urgent care center. By the time we got there, probably 1.5 hours after this started, the swelling was some better. The nurse practitioner that I saw prescribed an antihistamine and 3 days of one 20 mg prednisone pill a day. I&#39;ve never had a tingling or swelling tongue before in my life. I took only a half of one prednisone on 4/6, no Allegra.  On 4/7 the random itchy red rashes mostly on arms/shoulders happened once or twice and disappeared fairly quickly, but my upper lip swelled. I could feel it happening as I sat in my recliner in the morning. I hadn&#39;t had anything to eat yet. The doctor advised I take my Allegra and prednisone I received at urgent care on 4/6, so I did. The lip swelling gradually went down over a few days, but it still feels irritated on the inside of the lip as of 4/11.   Diarrhea beginning around 1:30 a.m. 4/8. Lasted about 3 days. I only very very rarely have diarrhea.  Mild sore throat starting Friday 4/10. Better by Saturday. Sore throats are so rare for me that I can&#39;t remember the last one, possibly several years ago.

Today, 5/5 she came to the pharmacy to show me the  circle rash that had developed around injection site. It was also swollen and felt like a bruise. I counseled patient on &#34;covid arm&#34; and that it was likely her immune system activating. I explained this can be a common reaction after getting the COVID vaccine. Patient had no other symptoms. I went over things to look out for in relation to blood clots and any warning signs and when to reach out to her doctor. I suggested she fill out Vsafe and I told her I would report to VAERS.

My chest was burning like it was on fire - lungs felt like they were on  fire. I woke up the next morning, with a little bit of body aches - I slept the entire next day pretty much (the 7th). On the 7th, I noticed that my heart was beating - fluttering- skipping- beating. My left left also swelled up and was red. I had  PVCs with pulmonary embolism on that left leg  in1996 - when I was doing the chemo. My left leg ached, burned and got red on the 7th. I was going to see the PCP the following week and I was still having issues with the heart but the leg was getting better. It can still swell, burn and get red quite a bit of night because I stand on my legs all day - but the amount of pain and swelling did go down over that week while I was waiting to see the doctor. I had an ultrasound on my leg. And a heart halter to monitor my heart for 24 hours. I do have PVCs.  Stress from vaccine caused Herpes Outbreak - that was on the left inner thigh right next to genitals - bumps within four days of vaccine.  Created more pain. Took Benadryl for pain - helps with the nerve pain - two days with. I took 3000 mg a day of Tylenol for three days after the vaccine.  Have not recovered from the calf and heart symptoms.

In the middle of the night my headache kept getting worse, my eyes started to hurt really bad and I also broke out in hives. About 6 hours later my headache felt like it wanted to explode. I saw a doctor through Tele-health by  who prescribed a 6pk of steroids.  Then on Day 6, my headaches came back along with the hives and I felt really tired and the hives broke out all over my body including my crotch and ear canal. He prescribed a 6pk of steroids and I started to feel and get better. On Day9, all of my symptoms were resolved except for the fatigue. To this day I still continue to have fatigue.

                                                A few minutes after the patient received dose 1 of the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine, the patient started having trouble breathing, her throat felt &#34;swollen and thick&#34;, was shaky, had itchy hands, and her lip was swelling. Her blood pressure was 174/86 and her pulse was fluctuating in the mid-high 80s. I administered 1 tablet of diphenhydramine (25mg) and 1 dose of the 0.3mg epi-pen. After about 7-10 minutes, she said her symptoms started to level out and were no longer getting worse. Her lip swelling started going down by the time EMS arrived. I continuously checked her blood pressure, heart rate, and heart rhythm while waiting for EMS to arrive and take over her care. They took her to the closest emergency room for continued monitoring.

Benaydyl was given and an Epipen was used, I was taken by ambulance to the local hospital ER where an IV was started, steroid was injected.  I was kept several hours for observation and sent home.  The following day I had attacks of itching and rashes as well as occasional numbness in my lips, by Thursday evening it was worse, returned to a different hospitals ER at 2am Friday morning, more steroid was given and I was observed, and sent home with an prescription for an epipen as well as steroids.  Continued to take Benadryl often taking two with in a half hour, Monday May 24 went to my own docotor, as I had a new reaction of pressure in both ears with pressure in my cheeks and around the back of my head.  She give me a prescription for additional steroids and is still monitoring me as I am still reacting.

The headache was three days long. I felt achy and sore the next day as well. I felt like I had a flu. There were huge blood clot looking blisters, and red dots on both my arms. My left arm was worse than my right arm. I called the doctor and she asked me to come in, but I had to take pictures first of my arms before coming in. Then when I was able to go to the office, I took blood tests and the MRI. Everything came back okay.

Fever lasted 2 days and fever lasted for 5 days. 5/10 the arm was sore and there was a 6x6? huge rash. 5/24- 5/26 I had a rash that I kept under control with Benadryl. 5/29 my saliva glands began to swell and that?s why I went to the Doctor. The Dr sent me to an ENT and Rheumatologist.

                                                The actual injection itself was so painful that I almost passed out. It hurts so badly while the needle was in my arm and when she took it out it was worse. I was in such pain that I began to sweat profusely and apparently I turned white and began dry heaving. This was all within a minute or so.  I really thought I was going to pass out. A woman with a tag that said pharmacist came rushing over. She got a reclining chair with wheels, they help me into it and then took me to a recovery room. After a few more minutes of sweating and dry heaving I began feeling better.  The pharmacist got me some paper towels so I could dry myself off as I was drenched in sweat. I asked her for a bottle of water. I waited the 15 minutes and came home.  They never checked my vital signs. Once I got home, I laid down and slept for 15 hours. I was fine the next day and my arm was never sore.  Could  the shot have hit a nerve? I?ve never felt such acute pain.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the single dose at 10:40.  In approximately 11 minutes I started to experience shortness of breath.  I thought it was my N95 mask so decided to head to the car after my 15 minute wait period was completed.  After sitting down in the car I started the following symptoms:  shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, swelling of face, dizziness, weakness.  I sit in the car for approximately 15 minutes then headed home.  I had a driver (thank goodness).  I continued to have symptoms and what felt like elevated blood pressure (I did not have access to a pressure cuff).  After resting at my driver&#39;s house for about 5 hours I felt better and headed home.  The next morning the symptoms were less but still present.  In addition I had a slight rash on my stomach that wrapped around my back.  After approximately 48 hours all of the symptoms subsided.  My blood pressure had returned to normal also.  All swelling went down.

I went to the ER on March 19  for nausea and vomitting, was dehydrated and received IV fluids. I also had hives which I was prescribed Steroids for.  The next day, March 20, I went to urgent care for severe hives and was given a steroid shot and epinephrine shot.  I don&#39;t know if these symptoms are a result of the vaccine, but I did not have them prior to the vaccine so I thought they should be reported.  Thanks

                                                Arm became sore on the left arm - I had a lump and my whole arm was like one giant bruise. That lasted about three weeks. I still have a lump but it isn&#39;t bruised looking anymore. The incident I went to medical care for - I saw the doctor on 4/2/2021 and he diagnosed I have shingles on my right leg. I thought it was spider bites. I did have the shingles vaccine. It is inflamed and I get nerve pain down my leg. It is very, very sore to the touch. Right now it is kind of dry - like blisters on it. It&#39;s a mild case. Doctor put me on Valacyclovir. He put me on it for one week and I have two more days after today.

                                                Initial reaction was flu-like symptoms but more concerning reaction was a bad rash with red small bumps on the same side as the shot was given directly above my left breast that was severely itchy. This rash is just now starting to dissipate but still itches; I used OTC cortisone creme and Benedryl to address the itching. The other major effect involved my left arm. For a full week, the muscle in which the shot was given was extremely sore to the touch and the whole arm ached. I still cannot fully extend that arm above my head without it feeling like an aching weight. Lastly, I had a pain in the center of my back as a hard ache that one week later still has not fully dissipated. It appears to be going away, but has lingered longer than I would have expected.

                                                I got the vaccine at around 11am on 6th April.  By 8pm the same day I was experiencing very severe chills - I have never felt so cold before in my life,  and the evening was not cold..  The next day, 7th April,  I woke up with bad aches in various, seemingly random areas of my body:  both upper arms, outside parts of both thighs, center of back between shoulder blades.  Interestingly all the aches were symmetrical.  I had not done any serious exercise to cause these symptoms, just a stroll around the park after getting the vaccine. I also experienced crushing tiredness and had to go back to bed in the afternoon.  Today, 8th April at 5:30 pm my left arm at the vaccine site still aches, but all the other symptoms had vanished by the morning.  I&#39;m 5&#39; 4&#34; and weigh 114lbs.  My husband got the vaccine at the same time and had no symptoms.  We are speculating that my smaller size may have contributed to my adverse reaction.  He is 5&#39; 6&#34; and weighs 180lbs.  In spite of this discomfort I&#39;m so relieved and pleased that we were able to get the vaccine.  Thank you!

                                                Experienced all common symptoms as well as other I have not heard of. Mental fogginess began at 8 PM (8 hrs after shot) and lasted until late the next evening Chills began at 8:30 PM and continued until early Friday AM. There were also a few instances of hot flashes in between the chills. About 10 hours after the shot the following began: headache (I rarely get headaches), nausea, muscle aches - mostly my quadriceps, low back pain, pain in the back of my neck, general lethargic feeling. These all lasted into Thursday evening, except the low back pain, which lasted into Friday AM. I felt a dull pain in all my back teeth that lasted about a day and was intermittent.

                                                2 hours after I received the vaccination, I came down with severe chills.  My entire body was shaking and I could not get warm.  I got extremely fatigued to the point that I could not get out of bed.  I got a severe headache (and I get headaches a lot...this one lasted for almost 10 days).  It seemed that every bone and muscle in my body began aching, from head to toes.  My fever went up to almost 102.  These symptoms continued for a course of four days, except the headache and fatigue (which lasted for approximately 6 days and the headache for 10 days).  I alternated Tylenol, Advil and Alleve.  They did not help hardly at all, unfortunately.  2 weeks later, I developed lymph node swelling in my right arm pit and alongside my right breast.  Today, these lymph nodes are still swollen and are painful to the touch.  I experienced pain at the injection site and if I touch it, it is still painful today, but does not ache like it did initially.

Next day she said the warm red spot is growing so she had a nurse at her workplace draw a circle around the site.  Within 2 hours the spot had grown bigger than the circle.  The spot is now bigger than a 50 cent piece.  Pt has taken Tylenol. Pt has an appt to see a NP today @ 2:45.

                                                Frontal lobe headache to start within a few hrs of vaccine. Back of the head to lower neck headache 8 hrs after. Every tooth in my mouth started throbbing at around 11 hrs  and continued for about 5 more hours. Also during that time, waves of nausea but no vomiting, also uncontrollable shivering but I wasn&#39;t cold and I wasn&#39;t hot but weird shivering. I did not take my temperature as I didn&#39;t feel like I had a fever. Around 13 hrs after a stabbing pain in front of thighs like hot pokers started and around 14 hrs thigh pain was still present but then the calves on both legs started to get the same stabbing pain.   At around 24 hrs after - headache remained, pulsating teeth stopped, thigh pain stopped but calf pain remained. Headache remained off and on for several days. General brain fog also lasted for about 1 week. The calf pain comes and goes even after 2 weeks. Arm where shot was administered was very tender to the touch for the last 2 weeks.   Lastly, I wouldn&#39;t say I had shortness of breath but at times I just felt like I needed to stop and force myself to take a very deep breath.

                                                Seven days after receiving vaccination I broke out in a rash that increased in severity for three days. It was located around my waist, down my legs and ankles. It started as raised red bumps that itched. By day four the clusters formed a flat mass of red- like blood pooling under my skin. The rash started Saturday night and I consulted with my healthcare provider in. I was in Denver for the week and she encouraged me to be evaluated. On Tuesday April 13 I saw Urgent Care.  He seemed stumped - especially since the onset of rash was seven days after injection. He put me on a six day course of methylprednisolone.  I began the course that day and that stopped the itching  and the daily multiplication of spots and spreading blood like areas.  Today, April 28 I am home in Portland and the spots are fading.  Both health care providers went through list of common irritants and they did not apply. I was traveling with my husband who did not develop any rashes or spots.

                                                The  day after my J&amp;J vaccine, I experienced left leg and knee pain with numbness sensation. I had a left knee replacement in September 2020.  I experience numbness below and above my knee cap. I also experienced bad migraines , arm soreness at the injection site. I called my doctor and he gave me an appointment to see him and he did not think it was related to the vaccine but he was not sure since I do have history of rheumatoid arthritis.  Today my left knee and leg still feel numb and I am taking my regular medications as instructed.

                                                First I had the itching and I came home and took a Benadryl and it subsided. The next day, I woke up stiff as a board. Everything hurt. Like I remember having the flu - feeling you get when joints etc. hurts all over. I took Tylenol - maybe took 1000 mg twice in that day. I have fibromyalgia and this was over and above that. The third day, the injection site on arm really hurt. The fourth or fifth day, the cough started - first a little irritation and then I started coughing and rattling and I have had the cough ever since. I have seen my doctor four times in the last month to get medications that work. I had to go to the walk in (Urgent Care at the clinic on Weekends) this Saturday  (5/15/2021) and get this new medication that seems to be working - it&#39;s a steroid - it&#39;s Levaquin . Although, yesterday, I still had that overall body hurt (I was in bed all day) - could have been side affect of medication but today (after two doses) seems to be better and I&#39;m not coughing as much.

I scratched so hard I bruised my arms! My skin turned bright red. I chewed 2 Benadryl, and after about an hour it faded somewhat but I kept itching until about midnight. My family monitored me to make sure I didn&#39;t go into anaphylactic shock. The nest day I called my physician&#39;s assistant and he said just to monitor it, in case it happened again.  It happened again on 5/4/21 at 10:30 p.m. It was not as severe, but I took 2 Benadryl immediately, since I recognized what was happening. I was better by about 12:30 a.m.. I had been in contact with my PA regarding my statins, and he said there wasn&#39;t anything they could do but to report it. He didn&#39;t think it was the statin that I had been taking, as I had discontinued the statin after the first incident, due to other concerns.

The itching did not begin subsiding until much later that evening. My appointment with  Dermatology was at 7:45 am on on 6/9/21.

About 1:00 am I got so chilled I couldn&#39;t get warm, I did not take my temperature because my thermometer goes under my tongue and I was afraid I would break it cause my teeth were chattering so bad. The next day I felt very weak and nauseous.  Then I discovered I had a rash at the top of my legs. My left breast was very sore I felt like  someone punched me. Today is Monday and I still have diarrhea.

She broke out with a rash the thursday after getting the vaccine and after a few days of vaccine she decided to go to urgent care since the \&#34;burning wasn&#39;t stopping\&#34; and it spread to her chest. She was discharged with a script of prednisone and the rash seems to be getting a little better. I will follow up with her in 2 days to make sure it has cleared up.

                                                March 13, 2021-1:30pm-Shot administered to right arm-it bled and the nurse had to apply pressure with an alcohol swab. It stopped immediately. 1:40-started feeling a tightness in the muscle in my neck under my right ear Stayed a few minutes longer than the required 15 to see if anything else presented. Mentioned it to the nurse and rep. The rep asked if I was nervous about getting the shot. When I said yes, he said it may just be that. Told me to contact my doctor with additional issues.  1:55-When leaving the parking lot, I felt my lips and nostril on the right side go numb-it felt like when Novocain is wearing off after a dentist visit. As the day progressed, the area under my ear and down my neck got more and more sensitive. My lips continued to feel numb. My injection site was tender and black and blue. When I went to bed at 9pm, I began experiencing lots of pain in my right lower jaw. I took a Tylenol but it didn&#39;t alleviate the pain. I called on-call doctor. Since I already had taken a Tylenol, he suggested an anti-inflammatory and warm moist compresses and to contact him again if things worsened. 3/14/21-7:00am-Upon awaking, my jaw pain was virtually gone but the whole area I had had the issue with was very tender to the touch. My lip still felt a bit numb.  3:25pm- It is now 26 hours since my vaccination. I still feel like I had trauma to the right side of my face and neck because it is sensitive to the touch. I also have a continued slight sensitivity of my lips on the right side. My glands on both sides of my neck now seem tender, as well. 3/15/21-3/17/21-I continue to have random pain/tenderness in the aforementioned areas. I also have an aura of tingling in my brain from time to time.

Vomited in middle of the night.  Felt very drained and tired with myalgia all of the next two days.  Majority of symptoms went away after that but I felt as if I was coming down with a cold for the next 7 days - today my nose has been running all day and I have a stuffed head  (and I have not had a cold since November 2019). I  had a covid test yesterday because I need to accompany my husband for a medical procedure on Friday - that was negative. I have seen no one, gone nowhere, and done nothing different since I received my vaccine than I had beforehand yet I am displaying symptoms normally associated with a cold although I have no fever.

The pain at injection site was quite sore for the first few days and then went away for the most part for a day or two but has now come back much worse.  It hurts to lift my arm or move it and feels like I&#39;ve lost strength to raise my arm.   I am in constant pain now and my arm around the injection site is painful when I press down especially on the bony area.

Lot of congestion and a runny nose.  I also got a stomach ache later in the evening.  by the time I went to bed around 10 pm I hurt all over and was very sick to my stomach.  I felt like if someone touched my skin my bones and muscles would all shattered.  I did not sleep much that night and woke up on Saturday, the 27th with the same symptoms but not quite as bad.  I still had nausea and a stomach ache and was very tired and drained.  I did start to get diarrheic around 3:30, 4:00.  I still hurt and have diarrheic and am very tired today, which is Tuesday, the 30th of March at 5:15 pm.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported.  The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included seasonal allergies, and codeine allergy. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1802068, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 05-MAR-2021 to left arm as prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 06-MAR-2021, after vaccination, she felt fine all day and night. The next morning she woke up and felt sick. She had nausea, headache, hive under eye. She laid back down and tried to sleep. A few hours later, she woke up to use the bathroom. She was very nauseous and dizzy. She lost consciousness and fell trying to get to the bathroom. She fell on her bed and was uninjured. The paramedics took her to the hospital. She was given medication for nausea, headache, and IV fluids. She gave blood for lab tests and they came back normal. No COVID test was administered. When she felt better, she was released. A few days later, she discovered her tongue was sore and red. She called her primary care physician (PCP). PCP said the red and sore tongue was probably related to allergies. Two weeks later, her tongue was not sore, but still red. They advised her to get a second opinion with another HCP. She was going to visit her allergy specialist.. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea, fatigue, inflammation on left eye, and small hives under eye on MAR-2021, and vomiting on 07-MAR-2021, and had not recovered from canker sore under tongue, and the outcome of fall on bed was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged).  Additional information was received from the patient on 23-Mar-2021. The following information was updated and incorporated into case narrative: Patient&#39;s medical history added as seasonal allergies and codeine allergy, Vaccination site as left arm added; Additional events as small hives under eye, fall on bed; lab test of blood work added; Event outcome of loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea, and fatigue was updated to recovered/resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: v1: Follow up information received updates  patient&#39;s medical history (seasonal allergies and codeine allergy), Vaccination site as left arm; Additional events (small hives under eye and fall on bed), laboratory test (Blood Work); Event outcome  (loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea and fatigue was updated to recovered/resolved). This updated information does not alter prior causality assessment of reported events 20210323730-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S-headache, nausea and fatigue. These events are labeled and are therefore considered potentially related. 20210323730-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S-loss of consciousness, fainted, heart racing, dizzy, vomiting, canker sore under tongue. These events are considered unassessable. The events have a compatible/suggestive temporal relationship, are unlabeled, and have unknown scientific plausibility. There are no information on any other factors potentially associated with the events.

                                                Slight chills and headache on the day following the vaccination.  My two adult children were vaccinated at the same time and had hard lumps and more pain at the injection site than I did.  My daughter&#39;s arm stayed that way for more than a week and then looked bruised.  My son has complained of mental fogginess while my daughter and I have suffered frequent light-headedness, chills and fatigue.  My lightheadedness seems to be becoming worse by the day.

This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: v0 This report involves a patient who experienced sinus inflammation, sensation of pressure in ear, injection site lump, chills, felt ill, injection site pain and fatigue next day after receiving Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Ad26.COV2.S for prophylactic vaccination. Approximately a week later, the patient experienced stomach cramps and diarrhea and 1.5 weeks later she had foggy feeling in head and &#34;believes the vaccine is contaminated&#34;, had fever blister, facial pain and vertigo. Approximately 3.5 weeks after being vaccinated the patient experienced pressure choking and difficulty swallowing. A throat (ENT) specialist was unable to diagnose and they felt there was some autoimmune effects. A month after being vaccinated the patient experienced stomach burning sensation, night sweats and tooth pain. Given the close temporal relationship and the nature of the events, the events of sinus inflammation, sensation of pressure in ear, injection site lump, chills, felt ill, injection site pain and fatigue are considered related to the vaccination. The insufficient information precludes a meaningful medical assessment of the remaining events, including &#34;autoimmune effects&#34;. The events will be assessed further when additional information is received.

                                                24 hours after the vaccine I developed a sharp pain on the inside of my left knee, slightly above the knee cap.  There was a soft bump in that area.  At work the next day I felt more sharp pains and bumps developing around my knees on both legs. The backs of my thighs were also beginning to burn.  I contacted the hotline set up at my work for adverse reactions when I got home from work that night.  They were concerned and had me call my doctor.  My work is onboard an aircraft and she did not want me to fly again without an ultrasound. I had an ultrasound perform on my left leg and the thigh of my right leg. It was normal.  Over the next week I would get stinging , painful bumps and used NSAIDS to help. Approximately six days after the shot the burning sensation on my thighs got worst. It spread for the back of my thighs to the front and then to the calves, arms and shoulders in that order, I started taking Benadryl to release the burning. I went to my doctor who sent me for another ultrasound and blood up. Three weeks after the injection the painful stinging bumps are still happening and the burning is on my legs, arms and shoulders. I am going back to the doctor today and talk about prescribing Gabapentin.

The skin of my upper body begin to itch and burn and got worse over the next couple day. It continued to get worse so I went back to the pharmacy on 15th but the pharmacist knew nothing regarding what I was experiencing and advised I used Aveno and swithch from Allegra to benedryl to help with the itching and if it didnt get any better to go to the dr.  Within the next couple weeks I reached out to my PCP a couple times but all he could provide it that I continued to take the benedryl because topical ointments wouldnt work.  Its still here but not as bad as it originally was.   I have a dermatologist appt on May 6th.  It had gotten better over the next few weeks but I am still experiencing the skin sensitivity.

That night of the shot, I had a headache - (Like a bus hit me) at 07:00 PM. The headache never went away after that. 24 hours later, I had a full body itch - I took Benadryl for that and that helped the rash. Since that first headache - I have had headaches every day. I have had to manage it with Tylenol and Ibuprofen and I still do. I saw my doctor 2 weeks after vaccine. My vision was going blurry about two weeks after my vaccine is when I really noticed it. My doctor sent me to an Ophthalmologist - I was told I had cataracts. I had my regular Optometrist - in January 2020 and nothing was noticed with cataracts. The doctor told me to try to manage the headaches and if I have any extreme pain then to go straight to ER.

Went to urgent care on unspecified date. NP examined me and discovered a lump in my arm. Both the lump and the vaccination site hurt when she pressed on them. She prescribed presdone and gave me a work order for a vascular ultrasound to be performed on my left arm. I went on unspecified date for the scan. It was discovered that a DVT blood clot had formed in my brachial vein in the left arm. I was then prescribed eliquis, 20 mg a day for 7 days and told not to take the predesone. NP called my pcp, his office immediately called me and asked me to come in as they are concerned about the high dosage of the eliquis.

I had a health report today primarily related to a different health issue but I asked her if I should use the Fluticasone cream on them. She cautioned me to use the steroid cream minimally on my face. The eczema I have on my hand - that is what I always there in dry, bad weather -  seems worse than it normally gets. The rash on my neck is gone. Also, two weeks after the Vaccine, I have noticed that my eye sight is different. I am going to the eye doctor tomorrow because of this.

I had a little headache. 4/2/21 Day 3: Morning was slow.  I noticed that I was tired.  Headache was stronger.  I took Ibuprofen 400mg. By mid day, I was on the couch the rest of the day.  My body was telling me to rest.  So I did.

Developed a rash on face. These all developed within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine. Took a benadryl to be safe shortly afterwards. Itching lasted for approximately 2 days. The rash is still about the same.   There was also swelling at the injection site, plus a rash that developed at the site about a day later. Other symptoms, such as fatigue, tiredness, and achiness, seem to be more typical outcomes.  Also developed a swollen lymph node under the arm that received an injection. This occurred two days afterwards.

Staying hydrated, but skin on lips sheeting off at times.  Also, using Chapstick.  This is not normal for me and I can only connect it with having received the vaccine.  I think the symptom is improving, but it very slow and minimal.  This started shortly after receiving the vaccine a month ago and continues to this day.  Other side effects were very temporary:  Headache, fatigue.  No arm soreness at all.  Mild body aches within 24 hours, but diminished rapidly.

                                                The injection did hurt quite a bit more than other injections I have had in the past but it began to feel better and I sat in a chair and was on my phone to send a message, spoke to a stranger who was looking for where to go, and was ok until the feeling of fainting began 10 minutes after the shot. I put my head between my knees but it did not help so I called for help and eventually was helped onto the floor to lie down which began to help. I had vision trouble and hearing trouble and could not speak. I was told my neck became bright red as my face grew white and my hands twitched and my eyes rolled around. I found out later that I had also peed my pants. I have fainted only once before in 1989, and found this reaction pretty frightening although I do not believe it happened as a result of anxiety or fear, the adverse effect itself was frightening and unexpected- not listed on any paperwork I received and was not aware it could occur.

I felt lightheaded and needed to sit for awhile after the shot. The next night I started getting pain in my right arm and I couldn&#39;t move it. My nerve endings in my arm, shoulder, and clavicle felt like they were on fire. The lymph nodes under my right arm and neck were swollen. I had three swollen lymph nodes in my neck, but one went down, and I still have two swollen nodes in my neck. My quality of life has suffered because the pain in my arm is so bad.

I did feel like it wouldn&#39;t be smart to drive so my husband drove me home. I had a slight fever that night and next day, I felt super tired. I scheduled an ultrasound for 1 week following the shot, My ears kind of freaked out after the ultrasound and was itching and burning, I also got a rash around my neck after ultrasound. The rash felt like fire. Allegra helped with the itching. Faint rash traveled down my arms. The Dr. put me on prednisone the rash spread to my back and upper legs. Benadryl was not helpful. It lasted approximately 2 weeks.

It turned into a right side rash and moved all the way up to my rear - mainly the back side of my leg. It was very severe and painful. The doctor gave me Valtrex (Valacyclovir tablets), Tylenol, and Methylprednisolone. I had some relief after a week, but the rash started to scab up.

The muscle is still affected and strained after 6 days. I waited a half hour at the site and got into my car at 3:45. On the drive home within 30 minutes my face started to itch and turn red, then my mouth inside started to itch, then my eyes started to itch. After that my throat started to feel gravely, so I took 75 mgs of gel cap benedryl. This is what I feel and take upon getting stung by a bee. I also took my albuterol inhaller two puffs which I also always have on me because of my asthma. I was sleepy but had dinner and went to be. I did not feel that I had to take more benedryl during the night.

                                                One week after vaccination, patient awoke with intense generalized itching  (she described as a &#34;internal burning itchiness&#34; that was &#34;all over&#34;).  She saw no rash or hives.  Continued for remainder of night, difficult to sleep.  Next day her husband found what he described as a few &#34;faint, non raised patches of very light hives&#34; on the patient&#39;s back.  She looked more carefully and found a few small similar patches on both arms and legs.  Treated with OTC lotion, CeraVe Itch Relief Lotion from store.  Patient says 12 hours after onset that the &#34;insane burning/ itching has subsided for now.&#34;  Patient reports no new foods, clothing, washing machine detergent, illnesses, or other exposures.  I am a physician, and the patient called me (her brother) to ask me whether this was a known side effect of the Janssen COVID vaccine.  I did not see this described in the FDA advisory committee data package, but just a general reference that urticaria would be an expected side effect to a vaccine.

Treated with 1 Benedryl around 1.5 hrs after rash first appeared. Also used some cortisone cream on the worst areas. Symptoms mostly relieved although some rash still present. Took 2nd Benedryl before bed (10 pm). Day 7 after injection: Hives returned at 4am slightly worse than when it first appeared. Took 1 Benedryl and after 2 hrs the rash started to go down and itchiness greatly reduced. 1 Benedryl around 11am. By evening only a few bumps remained. Residual itchiness lingers. No more Benedryl taken. I have never had a rash or hives like this.  There have been no changes to detergents, soaps, diet.

                                                Saturday night around 9:45 my hands and arms began itching.  Then i noticed they had broken out in a red rash with whelps beginning on my arms.  It then began breaking out on my face and legs.  I took 25 mg of benadryl.  The rash continued to spread so  I went to the ER. They administered prednisone, pepcid, and benadryl.  After about 1 hour the itching was better and the rash began to fade but it didn&#39;t go away.  The ER sent my home with a predisone dose pack for 6 days and to take 50 mg  benadryl every 6 hours.  When i awakened this morning I had the rash on other sites on my arms, legs and stomach and in my right eye, it was red and a little swollen.  I took the first day&#39;s dose of prednisone and 50 mg benadryl and 20 mg of famotidine. After about 30 mins to 1 hour the itching and redness improved but has not completely gone.

Hives in the crook of my right arm. Burning, itchy little red bumps. I couldn&#39;t swallow but I think that was from the high blood sugar as my mouth was very dry.

                                                In the same area as my shingles virus, which is well on its way to healing, I developed a rash about 6 or 7 hours after the vaccine.  The rash is small red markings that look like hives and it is unbelievably itchy.  I took benadryl which reduced the itching within 4 hours, but did not appear to impact the rash.  Today is day 1 after my vaccine, so I am watching the rash to see if and how it progresses over the next 48 hours.

Took 2 Benadryl three times that day, contacted doctor via email.   The rash was better the next day (March 16) but took 2 Benadryl again three times that day.   Sent photo to doctor who had an allergist in the clinic look.  He said it was a reaction to the vaccine.    March 17 rash was completely gone and have had no other reactions since.

                                                On 4/4/2021, I developed a red rash on both arms at approximately 3 pm.  As the evening progressed, the rash spread to both legs, tops of both feet and lower back area.  I took a Benedryl dose in tablet form before going to bed. As of 4/5/2021, the rash is still present.  My physician was notified.  I have taken another Benedryl tablet to help with the rash.

Right away after receiving the vaccine-- stiff neck on the left side which after a night&#39;s sleep, moved to my right side of neck. No big deal.     Tired &amp; &#39;drunk&#39; after the vaccine which lasted until mid-afternoon the next day.  No big deal.       The worst of all happened at 3 1/2 days, a rash started in the evening, went to bed, woke up the next day with rash almost everywhere. Red, swollen, &amp; itching like crazy.   The next day- Sunday, along with Monday &amp; Tues. was horrid. I am covered from my scalp to the tops of my feet, my crotch hurts, as do my breasts. Used Benadryl cream, aloe vera to no avail.

Don&#39;t remember reactions to previous vaccines but not surprised considering allergies. Left side of face felt strange but didn&#39;t look any different when a selfie was taken. Sometime during the afternoon/evening, experienced a headache of short duration. Approximately six hours after shot, experienced chills and low grade fever. Simply went to sleep. Better the following morning, though very tired.  Probably unelated rough itchy patch on RIGHT arm the day following vaccine. Went away with no treatment.

She got the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine on 4-6-21 at 1:37pm. She said she was fine but 4 days later at the site of injection it was very red, swollen and about 2 inches in diameter. She has been taking Benadryl around the clock and it seems to be helping she just wanted to have  Vaers report filled out just in case. She doesn&#39;t believe it serious to require a visit to the emergency room.

Pain continued throughout the night, until I finally got up and just walked around house to try to get some relief then laid down and try elevating leg on pillows. The pain continued so got u p and walked around more and pain finally subsided enough to get some rest.  Then felt like just had a bruise in that area of the leg for a day.

                                                2 weeks post inoculation developed burning sensation/tingling /pain from armpit to thumb; some tingling in thumb - sensation more like nerve pain vs muscle pain.  After two days gradually improved.  Muscle strength not affected, but movement in most directions elicited sharp pain coursing down arm.  Gradually improving to pain over the deltoid near injection site;  as of 19 days since initial pain motility much improved but still periodically throbs and sensitive to pressure and certain movements.   No treatment except restricting use of arm and time.  10 hrs post inoculation developed chills, myalgia and headache.  Chills and myalgia resolved in a few hours; an aspirin the next day resolved the headache.    This reaction was not unexpected.  Did not have pain at injection site until 2 weeks post injection.

                                                Metallic taste in mouth 30 minutes after receiving vaccine. I have had a lot of stress (significant other diagnosed with Stage 4 inoperable NSCLC ) and had been attributing the often present headache to that, but they were also accompanied by a butterfly pattern red flush across my nose.  Acid reflux which I was attributing to stress or alendronate.  Woke in the night 4/12 to severe acid reflux, nausea, headache, flush, thought maybe I was having a heart attack (I have no cardiac/BP issues); then last night, 4/14 about 6 PM, weird numbness tingling in right arm from center of my chest  passed in about 5 minutes. Significant Other said I had the pattern flush on face at time of attack which faded as I began to feel better.  I have not consistently felt at 100% since vaccination, but I have a lot going on and attributed it to that.

                                                I have developed a hard very sore lump starting on day 5 after my vaccine. The lump is below the injection site to the right of my bicep and it is about the size of a large grape and very sore. I have heard of others developing a lump in the area of their lymph notdes under their arms but my lump is not in that area.

                                                For the 1st 10 days it felt like my brain was swollen too big for my skull.  Not like any headache I have ever had.  I did take some acetaminophen but it didn?t seem to quell the pain.  While still at vaccine site I got a weird taste in my mouth, dry mouth and my voice started going hoarse.  I stayed a while longer to be watched as I also had itching.  I did not go into hives.  I had pain in my body from time of injection ? the ?typical? sore arm didn?t set in until day 3-4.  I had hot spots all over my body ? but not fever or rash.   On 4/11/21 I broke out into a rash on my forehead that lasted about 4 days.  What I want to specifically report is I like these zinger/sharp traveling pain from my temples to posterior head.  Still having this sensation but not as frequently.  They don?t last long but are noticeable at the time they are happening.  The only way I can explain the pain is that it felt like when you break a blood vessel in you finger and it really, really hurts for a short while and then pain subsides.  I started having these pin prick sensations within the first few days all over my body (arms, legs, back) but the frequency has decreased.  Days 2-6 I was just wiped out and rested.  I am still feeling lack of energy still today.

Did not bother me except when flu-like symptoms flared up in the afternoon for 4 days. The rash then itched and stung a bit. I used a cannabis ointment on it for comfort. I still have a few small dried scabs from the rash.

                                                SORE ARM, AT FIRST ATTRIBUTED TO muscle ache, but later realized it was very specific to injection site, and very intense pain.  I was unable to sleep more than a few short spurts the entire night as the pain was so intense.  I read online that Benadryl was to be used for the pain, as well as ice.  Originally I had used heat, before finding the information online.  Nothing seems to help at this point.

The cough got worse, and I had green sputum. After ten days I contacted my doctor and he prescribed antibiotics. It cleared up a little, but it was persisting. I was tested for Covid-19 and the test was negative. I had the cough for almost three weeks. I developed a weird bruise on my right forearm the size of a silver dollar. It was round and it took a couple of weeks to go away. My arthritis in my hands was also worse than normal for the three weeks.

The morning after the vaccine I felt lightheaded and weird. I had heart palpitations and I was queasy. I started to walk back to my bedroom. The next thing I knew I woke up on the floor after passing out. After that I felt like my body was crumpled and I was disoriented. I could barely walk but I made it to the couch, and I had bumps in the front and back of my head near my ear. I was in a lot of pain and I think I was in shock. My foot was painful, and I saw a foot doctor. I had a doctor?s appointment and they did an EKG and they sent me to a Neurologist. It has been seven weeks I still have dizziness and nausea and it is hard to focus. I also have pain in my knee and my right arm.

I was lethargic, wanted to sleep all the time, and had no energy. This is gradually getting better, but still occurs. I periodically have headaches. After two full months I continue to have regular eruptions of hives on my arms. Prior to taking the vaccine I had no health issues, ran daily,  and worked out regularly. I have just recently started walking, but have not been able to run.

I had a cough and an extreme stuffed nose that I had to take Musilex in order to breathe. The cold lasted 11 days, but I still wake up with a cough and stuffed nose. I also have hives on my face. Sometimes I see them and sometimes I just feel itchy. At first I thought it was a side effect to the Atenolol I started taking -- and it might be -- but my face continues to itch despite having stopped taking Atenolol over a week ago. I wonder if these side effects are the vaccine, especially the cold symptoms since the vaccine has a cold virus in it.

After this time the lump started to decline and pain in the arm started.  This pain ran all the way down my arm to my fingers from the injection site.  At times the pain is unbearable and requires that I take Tylenol and put on a Lidocaine 1% patch.

                                                Right after receiving the vaccine my thumb started to swell. I took a picture of it because I couldn&#39;t believe the size. For the next three mornings I woke up with a headache. I took Tylenol and it helped get rid of the headaches. I started to see unexplained bruising on my arms and legs a week after the vaccination. To this day, I still have bruising, but it is going away. I noticed that I was getting Petechiae (tiny red, flat spots that appear on the skin). I noticed a bruise on my breast ( I am a breast cancer survivor and have had reconstructive surgery on my breasts.) After the bruise started to disappear, my skin was already thin from radiation, but the skin started to open up and expose my silicone inside my breast. I had to go to the surgeon and my implant had to be removed. Now I am flat chested on that side. This is going to take several weeks of recovery to get through this. The surgery for the removal of the silicone was 9PM PST, Emergency Surgery.

                                                I tested positive for Covid-19 with no severe symptoms in February of 2021. One week after the vaccine on 04/09/2021 I broke out in hives after eating a meal. The hives were mostly on the right side of my body but there were some on the left. I also had some numbness and tingling in my mouth. I used some anti itch cream, and the hives were mostly gone the next day. Twelve days after the vaccine I started to unusual vision symptoms which included wavy zig-zag lines in my vision. My doctor advised that they were Ocular Migraines. I had a headache at the same time, but I have never had Migraines before. I was also fatigued with a little dizzy and nauseous. The headache lasted for one day, but I still felt a little nauseous the next day. The feeling of fatigue and tired ness lasted for about six weeks. Two to three days after Ocular Migraines I started to notice a bright red rash on the right side of my back. It quickly spread around my side to the midline and then up my right side to my Bra line in front. I consulted my doctor on 04/19/2021 and he identified the rash as Shingles I was prescribed Acyclovir 800mg for 7 days and then an additional 5 days. I saw my Dermatologist on 05/06/2021 and he said that the Shingles were still active so I was Prescribed Valacyclovir. The Shingles lasted about six weeks total with some fatigue before I felt normal. I still have some visible signs of the rash on my back.

Then she got petechia in both legs and she took it easy, drank a lot of water.  She took it easy, but ever since then her energy is not there, she is &#34;zapped&#34;.  She has changed her whole routine, she is pretty active and now she cannot do much due to the fatigue.  She is now really concerned as it is lasting.  She feels like she is mentally confused.  She could not tell me her address without looking it up first.  It has started to subside some the feeling of being off.  She feels like that she has no blood in her.  She feels like she&#39;s out of iron, and zapped of energy.   She has not called her doctor.

                                                Patient received Janseen COVID vaccine. The first 1/2 of the vaccine was given easily IM to the left deltoid and then the patient complained of severe arm pain, tensed her muscles, and the last 0.25ml was difficult to inject. Then the patient became hypotensive 90/45, dizzy, and felt like she was going to pass out. She was laid in the supine position, given a cool cloth for her forehead and monitored for approx. 45 minutes. Her blood pressure remained 90/60, 96/56 at discharge. Her heart rate ranged from 55-65, regular. Her son came to take her home as we did not feel comfortable with the patient driving. The patient was continuously monitored by the NPs and APCT. She ambulated without difficulty and was discharged home. She was given information for V-safe to report her reaction and advised to follow up in the ER for any SOB, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, syncope, CP, etc.

There is a burning sensation with mild itching and red blotches/spots.  I contacted my physician who recommended OTC treatment at home and advised me to report it to VAERS.  It is mild in terms of impact but not expected four days after the vaccination date.

                                                3/18 vaccination  3/19 4am woke up I felt sick I had a HA, Nauseas, dizzy, hard to stand, hard to keep eyes open to even go to the bathroom. I tried to go back to sleep. When I woke up, I took it easy. I did get the chills and sweats thru the day; skin turns really red (MCAS). That symptoms still comes and goes. The chills, regulating body temperature, has flared back up after being dormant for years.  3/30 I saw MD. She wanted to defer for 4-6 weeks after vaccination to see if symptoms were still persisting or leveling out.  I have since canceled every sort of appt since then as I don&#39;t have the energy.  *I am on the very tail end of an opioid withdrawal; tramadol. I have taken for 6 years, 400 mg weened down to 100 mg this last year, down to 12.5.

On Monday, the 15th, I had the worst flare-up of sciatica that I have ever had in my life. Left leg - it had a tremendous swelling. It was crippling. I am still using a pain. I cried because the pain was so horrific. I was able to get into the doctor early on Tuesday - prescribed Prednisone; hydrocodone; muscle relaxer. None of which touched the pain. I was unable to sleep for three days. I slept upright in a chair. I used an office chair as a wheel chair. I wasn&#39;t able to lay down. I&#39;ve improved but I still can&#39;t walk to the mailbox - could walk down there - two houses down but couldn&#39;t get back. I am using a cane still. I have to elevate leg on a recliner to sleep so it will help with the continued swelling. There was nothing I did that triggered it.

By the end of the day ,they were pointy hard lumps with heads on them. They spread to other parts of my body. They would rupture and they were huge. They were very itchy and painful. They were on my thighs, arms, back but they were worst on my feet ankles and calves. I took Benadryl and Epsom Salt baths which helped but they were there for a week. The first three days were the worst. They were popping up a few at a time for another month. They later ones were mostly on my thighs and I never had any on my arms. I have never had hives that ruptured so easily and were so big.

I slept 4 hours past my normal time for getting up. I had no balance and would stagger when standing. My entire body was in muscle and nerve pain. Even my skin hurt. I took 300 mg of Gabapentine which eased my pain. I continued to be off balance the remainder of the day, however, by the end of the day I was much better. I took several 1 hour naps throughout the day.

PCP has seen similar rashes in other patients after covid vaccine so recommended filing the report to vaers out of an abundance of caution.

I talked to my doctor about my symptoms and he does not know what caused my skin itchiness. He recommended for me take Benadryl and allergy medication. He also gave me a steroid but I could not take it since I am allergic to the steroids.  I want to find out why after my vaccine, my whole body and skin is itchy. I still have the itchiness today and it does not want to go away.

I hardly slept. (all these not worrisome to me) I&#39;m so glad my vaccine provider warned me that with underlying conditions, the vaccine could make them flare up. Which they did. In the morning I had widespread pain all over. Severe headache, and shortness of breath. Because I already have near emphysema hypoxemia oxygen levels, I checked my Oximeter and my blood oxygen was in the dangerously low 70&#39;s.  It stayed there until I put my oxygen concentrator on. Monitoring oxygen levels all day, I was able to keep it in the 80&#39;s to 90&#39;s, which helped.  40 hrs after injection , symptoms already fading away. All my adverse events were related to underlying conditions responding to the inflammation of the immune response. I feel  protected, glad I had the oxygen handy,  and I feel great about the  J &amp; J vaccine!

                                                I noticed a rash on my left front thigh about 1 day after vaccine. It then spread to my left front thigh. No itching or pain. It is one week later and it is almost gone. I was not sure if it was related to the shot as I had been doing yard work during that time. Then I saw an article this morning which described the rash accurately.  So it is probably related, however that being said, given the choice, I would take it again. Had no pain at injection site, no other issues, and I feel safer for the experience. Pharmacy sent text.

                                                Patient developed hives from upper thigh up to her neck bilaterally.  These were more localized in the torso area, to the point they overlapped.  These lasted for 3 days heavily but decreased in size and quantity over time.   They continue but are now much smaller and less frequent.  Claritan has helped to calm the hives.  Patient also noticed minor swelling of lips two days after vaccine.  No swelling of throat and no shortness of breath per patient.  The lip swelling would come and go and has disappeared.

Arm soreness appeared about a week later severe enough to keep me from sleeping on that side of my body.  Lasted about a week.        At the same time,   large bruises appeared on the &#34;shot arm&#34; from the shoulder down almost to my elbow. Soreness in my right calf developed after four weeks and still comes at times.

                                                I reported to my doctor that around 2 weeks after receiving the J &amp; J vaccine, a large bruise appeared on my right thigh. Their office recommended that I inform you of this.  Bruising is rare for me and I had not, to my knowledge, done anything to cause it. I have been in the system for follow-up reports regarding the vaccine and have always reported doing well. I have no other symptoms. This bruise, however, caught my attention after the latest news. So, I am reporting it, as directed.

                                                I can&#39;t say for sure but 9 days after receiving the vaccine, my condition called Erythromelalgia flared up terribly, which involved uncomfortable to intense burning of the outer ears 24/7 with no relief.  It calmed down for a couple of days and then came back with other symptoms, including the burning ears, and parts of my neck and face.  In addition to that, my eyes were bloodshot and had drainage coming from them and in the morning, it appeared that they had like a lining of film over them.  Skin is peeling due to all the burning in the areas described.  Several different treatments were tried but none has slowed down the flare-up.  After another trip back to the NP, she said that it was inflamation and gave me a steroid shot along with prednisone tablets.  I also went to an optometrist who found some things wrong with my eyes and prescribed some steroid eye drops.  Before the vaccine, we pretty much had the Erythromelalgia under control with meds but this time, it&#39;s been hard to get things under control and more tolerable.

About 45 min after vaccine in car, shooting pain in upper arm that went down my forearm, and up neck, stopped and then started up again... - lasted for about 10 min.  thought I was having a heart attack, but it all subsided.  My husband felt it was anxiety - Happened again when we got home on and off,  we thought sore muscle - subsided.  Wakes me up at night sometimes, happens occasionally during day, happens when golfing - asked a PA friend in heart department at hospital and she said it may take time to heal from vaccine bruising.  Past 3 days got another cold virus and yesterday my vaccine site and forearm was killing me all day off and on, a couple of times up same side neck.  Got me concerned enough today to call Tri-county who scheduled vaccine to see if anyone else had similar symptoms - told me to fill this form out.  I was concerned it was a blood clot.  Better today- dull pain off and on.

                                                That next day, the injection site pain was with me for over a month. I couldn&#39;t move my arm; felt like someone was jabbing me. I can finally touch my arm now without feeling pain. The brain fog - it feels like - in the front of my forehead right above my eyebrows -  like there&#39;s something the size of orange that is just sitting there. It stops my thoughts and word processing. I was fine the day before the vaccine. That has not gone away. The doctor does not know what to do about the brain fog. I was having horrific full body muscle pain - especially in my legs. Like someone had put 20 lbs weight on each of my ankles. That is sort of resolved. But the fatigue - hasn&#39;t resolved. I always have a little bit of low level fatigue but this is worse - I have to have two naps a day now. Brain fog is the most troubling to me - hard to function - it&#39;s like instant Alzheimer&#39;s - my words are stuck in my mouth and I feel like I&#39;m trying to think through a veil or fog.

Same on 3rd day but much bigger redness spreading down arm, 2 1/2 by 2 1/2&#39; hard mass and red, itchy, painful, chills and nausea. Next morning called Dr. I am taking amoxicillin-clav 875-125ng tab.  Three days later mass is turning from red to pink and retreating. Still hurts  and now bruses show around the injection site, which I thought was strange. The vaccine actually hurt when given (I get injections every three months, so I know what they will feel like, but this hurt and went very deeply and then burned). I felt warm afterwards for about 10 minutes.

I started getting dizzy and very whoozy. I felt my vision starting to close in. I thought I was going to pass out. I got the attention of the person across me to get an attendant and they brought me a chair with wheels. Two people got me up (and I&#39;m not a big person) - they were worried I was going down and I was taken to exam room. They said I was white as a sheet. She checked my eyes and throat a few times and checked my blood pressure. It was lower than normal but she didn&#39;t seem really concerned about it - 104 over 60 something which is low for me. She gave me water to sip. She gave me very cold compresses to put on my forehead. They watched me pretty good. She had the epi-pen ready. She watched me and I sat in there and nurse came in a quite a few times to check me for about an hour. About an hour later the tightness went away and I started feeling myself again. We went home. I went to sleep. I woke up at night to go to bathroom and I was still a little woozy but I didn&#39;t fall. Next day, I just didn&#39;t feel well. My left arm was starting to hurt - was no swelling; it was a little red at injection site. It hurt just a little. I was woozy. My eyes couldn&#39;t focus as well. I felt out of it. I drank a lot of water and took a nap.  Yesterday, I felt pretty decent but still woozy somewhat. I tried to run errands with my husband  - just wasn&#39;t quite right. Today, much better but I&#39;m not quite myself yet. Just a little wooziness - weird feeling. Yesterday, I did feel a soreness in the back of my right calf muscle. It wasn&#39;t warm to the touch or swollen. I don&#39;t have it anymore, it went away.  It could have been a muscle thing from the first day of the vaccine when I got home and I got up and almost fell down. I do still have some achiness in joints. Especially in my knees - which isn&#39;t normal because they are replaced.

                                                Patient received vaccine on March 11, and reports that she began experiencing arm soreness immediately afterwards.  She was reporting soreness with pulsating pain for the first 2 to 3 days, now reports a constant dull and achy pain that is worse with activity and movement.  She has been using Tylenol, which she reports does help reduce pain symptoms.  She denies any reduction in her range of motion, but states pain symptoms are more prominent with movement.  She is also reporting daily headaches that occurred starting the day after getting the vaccine.  Patient reports headache is bilateral in nature with a dull, aching quality.  She states headache starts within 10 to 20 minutes of waking up.  She takes Tylenol to help with headache symptoms, which does seem to relieve the headache.  Some days, she reports headache comes back in the afternoon or evening.  She denies any nasal congestion, vision problems, tinnitus, postnasal drip or sinus pressure. No balance, near syncopal, or syncopal problems. Denies any sensory or motor impairment accompanying the headaches.

My chest felt a little funny. about 9am my face was really red, I got my BP checked 188/85 Oxygen was good and Dr said  to take benadryl and took two right away and I took 2 more after 6 hours, symptoms subsided that evening. My BP stayed high and I felt not good, I had pressure in my chest and some pressure on the left and right side of my breast,  BP was 177 at 4pm. I went home to bed I woke up with pressure again in my chest. I went to the Dr and he said come back in two weeks and see how you are, I went in this last monday and he put me on medication for high blood pressure

She complained of intense pain to her left shoulder above the injection site all the way to her neck. She had pain when moving her arm at first. We monitored her for 30 minutes and before she left she was pain free and able to freely move her arm.

                                                On day 11 post shot I started to feel mildly nauseated. Next day nausea increased, as did muscle aches and pain - by early evening I had repeated bouts of uncontrollable vomiting and uncontrollable diarrhea [no cramps, no warning] that lasted most of the night.  I did have a fever briefly - got all red and felt like I was on fire - but that passed pretty quickly while the rest continued.   I had to stay up all night, any attempt to lie down triggered more vomiting.  By 3 in the morning I was ?on empty? and by 6 am could lie down.  Nausea took three more days to leave completely.  Muscle pain is resolving, almost gone.  I am resuming my meds [everything that went down before came right back up].  The only tummy pain was after hours of vomiting [muscle strain].   Today is the 25th and I?m still tired and a bit foggy but otherwise feel better.  I had a call with my doctor about this and she said I should report it so that?s what I?m doing.

Drawing cramping pain followed in forearm, prickling turned to numbness. Mentioned this to one attendant, who recommended sitting longer. Sensations continued, another nurse/attendant checked on me, also mentioned I sit at least 30 min. All other sensations normal-no nausea, no headache, etc.  Small finger, finger next to it,-and their part of the hand to the wrist -were first numb, with occasional tingles, now still numb.[7:30 pm.]  Slight cramp from top of arm to neck, is off -and- on from injection wait-time til now.  I left at 11:55, took temperature at 12:20, =99.4 (my usual basal is 97.6).

                                                I woke up on Sunday morning with tingling in my left arm from my shoulder to my fingertips and my right leg by the shin area.  My left ear was itchy and hot to the touch. I took half a Benedryl. I did a telemed visit with my MD about my arm. She ordered a STAT US of my left arm and prescribed me prednisone.

Way more than my normal. My ear is pealing off more than before the shot. I am losing parts of my left ear every since the SHINGLES shot. This lasted for a couple of days then went back to my NORMAL(?) reactions i have had for many years from the shingles shot.

                                                Janssen covid-19 vaccine EUA - side effects 1.  head &#39;fog&#39;   2. voracious hunger   [i&#39;ve NE:VER had a flu vaccine]   21 hours in i&#39;m still starving . what&#39;s the cure? 15 hours later I woke up at 6 a.m. because I was starving I had to make myself eggs and toast. 17 hours  &#34;  I had a bagel. 18 hours &#34;  I made meatballs I was eating them like candy.  [albeit my meatballs are delish carmelized onions, roasted garlic, basil, pesto...yum]   I feel drugged. [ it&#39;s like a trip from the 70s flashback].  I feel weird.  closest thing is dizzy but not dizzy just weird, very weird.  head/brain fuzzy .  The munchies continue.   I never heard of these side effects before we&#39;ll see how long they last. only a pale yellow bruise where the injection went in.  minimal arm soreness if any , no rash.    I got a 12-page booklet for taking the vaccine yesterday I&#39;m going to report the symptoms to the CDC, Johnson &amp; Johnson janssen and whoever else wants to hear about them there&#39;s a big long list in the pamphlet they gave me.  Maybe there&#39;s a cure. I hope it doesn&#39;t last too long I&#39;ll run out of food.  6 hours later I&#39;ve got the munchies I&#39;m eating everything in sight for dinner I had soup, two salad,s a steak, dessert and pretzels.  I&#39;ve never eaten that much ever.   4 hours down I started getting super hungry but I thought it was cuz I barely ate breakfast and lunch cuz I didn&#39;t know how this was going to react.  I still don&#39;t feel a thing in the arm. yay hope it sticks. I can&#39;t even see where they gave me the shot. I will admit the shot did hurt a little when it went in, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s cuz she pushed the plunger fast, or  if it was cold from the refrigerator or what but I definitely felt a little something with it going in but not since.   I realized that when I went into the hospital out building to get the vaccine I was talking to the nurse for a while because they had to go get my vaccine and she was telling me that three of her family members got the Johnson &amp; Johnson and they didn&#39;t feel a thing, no sore arm no fever no nothing so I&#39;m hoping that subliminally I absorbed that and that&#39;s why I&#39;m having such a favorable results cuz I think I was really expecting something or other.  Even though I know someone who got the jnj &amp; didn&#39;t have a problem. I did my own research and nobody under 50 has had a problem and even those people had medical conditions and we&#39;re taking prescription drugs and so on which is not my case we&#39;ll see.   The first hour has passed no rash, no soreness of arm nothing I&#39;m a little bit surprised happily.

                                                On MON evening after the shot, at 11:00pm I experience severe chills that lasted for hours. Tuesday morning I awoke with a bad headache and had body aches all day as well as tendonitis- like pain in both lower arms. I felt somewhat better on WED but I did notice that my compression sleeve on my right arm (lymphedema arm) felt more snug than usual. That night I had severe chills and fever of 101. I slept until 11:45am on THU and felt aches all over. Very fatigued. Went back to sleep from 2:00pm until 6:00pm. Temp was down to 99.8.  When I woke and removed my compression garment, my arm was red and swollen, also rash-like bumps, and was very warm to the touch. FRI morning it looked worse, so I contacted my lymphedema specialist and then my PCP. This is NOT a good situation for anyone who has lymphedema and will necessitate months of treatment.

                                                Within 5 minutes of the shot, my skin began to itch all over (legs stomach, arms, neck) and my tongue went numb.  I have had this reaction before with exposure to wet polyurethane.  The doctor looked at my leg to see if if there was a rash (there was not) and she gave me a bendryl.  The symptoms subsided.  I stayed at the clinic for a total of 2 hours.  Later that evening, the itching came back so I gave myself one benedryl and the itching subsided.  The following morning the itching was gone and my tongue felt better.

                                                Later the day after the vaccine I developed severe chills and a really bad sore throat.  I developed hives in my throat and mouth which cause hoarsness and was hurting really bad.  On that Monday I visited my PCP who prescribed an antibiotic which did help and took antihistimines also.  I developed a fever an was really tired and after about 3 day the symptoms subsided.  My arm was really sore for about 2 days also.

                                                On Saturday, I started itching in the inside of my lower arm between my wrist and elbows (both -  mainly my right arm but left arm was itchy too). I had splotches like a rash and light red bumps. My arms puffed up a little (both). It looked like corduroy fabric -  red like line indentations. I started using aloe vera. That helped a little bit. I had some Cephafil cream (OTC). I thought I had a reaction to something in the soil from yardwork I was doing. I had redness and a rash in my knuckles - between palm in my hand and my knuckle of where it bends - they were red; rough and raw. There was a little rash on the tops of my hands. I went to the doctor on the 12th and he prescribed. I used it for four days: Trimethadione cream with an acetate name on the end of it. My right arm did have a little swelling around the elbow joint.

                                                Johnson and Johnson Janssen COVID-19 EUA vaccine  At the time of the injection, the vaccine burned as it entered my arm. (I have never felt that burning sensation with any other vaccination that I have had in the past. Twenty minutes after the vaccination, I became lightheaded and dizzy.  I could walk but I was wobbly. At one hour after the vaccination, I felt a sharp stabbing pain in the left side of my tongue and then the left side and only the left side of my tongue began to go numb. Within a couple of minutes, I realized that my left jaw was going numb, too.  The numbness slowly but surely began to move up the left side of my face all the way to the top of my head.  I had a sharp but brief headache on the left side of my head  that subsided quickly but the numbness remained.  I went home and talked to two people on the phone for several hours because they wanted to be sure that I was OK. At two hours after the vaccination, my face was still numb but I could think and talk clearly, but I was clearing my throat and coughing a lot.  At that point, I also realized that my whole left arm was a little numb and my fingers on my left hand were tingling.  That numbness lasted about 20 minutes and then subsided. The facial numbness lasted for hours.  I wasn&#39;t scared and I wasn&#39;t in pain but it was very strange.  It felt a little bit like the after affects of dental anesthesia but it wasn&#39;t just in my mouth it was the whole left side of my face.   I believe that this must have been an allergic reaction to one of the chemicals in the vaccine but I don&#39;t know which one.  If you can tell me which chemical it might have been, I will avoid it in the future.

On exam the patient has obvious facial swelling.  She has what appears to be an urticarial rash on her chest.  While she does have swelling around her lips and face otherwise she does not appear to have any obvious signs of airway involvement with no swelling of her tongue or uvula, she has good phonation with normal respirations without difficulty.  Does not appear to be having reactive airway disease exacerbation at this time.  Does not appear to have impending respiratory distress.  She otherwise does have some skin changes in her bilateral lower extremities that she reports is baseline with her history of eczema.  Primary concern at this time is for possible allergic reaction.  Patient appears to have angioedema.  Does not appear to have anaphylaxis.  Other abnormalities are considered.  Patient will be connected to cardiac and respiratory monitors.  IV access will be obtained.  The patient will be given a 1 L IV fluid bolus.  She will be given Benadryl, Solu-Medrol, and famotidine.  Patient be monitored for response.  Labs have been ordered to evaluate.  EKG as well as chest x-ray will be obtained.  We will file VARES report.   Chest x-ray obtained.  There is no acute cardiac no acute pulmonary pathology on my interpretation.  Laboratory evaluation has returned.  The patient&#39;s CBC is reassuring.  CMP shows a glucose of 78, otherwise reassuring without significant abnormality.  Troponin within normal limits.  Covid, influenza, RSV testing is negative.  On repeat evaluation the patient is resting comfortably.  She reports that the itching has resolved.  Her face feels less uncomfortable.  She has had no progression of the swelling.  On repeat examination she continues to have facial swelling as well as swelling around her lips however she has no tongue swelling, no swelling within her posterior oropharynx, and her phonation continues to be normal.  She and her friend were informed of the initial findings.  Plan at this time is to admit for further evaluation and treatment.

                                                On day 9 felt both sides of neck tender under ear by jaw line.   Upon palpation  both sides painful however left side more.   Paid no attention to it except on  day 10 because pain still felt  with left side more painful.  No lump or bump felt just very sensitive and painful upon palpation.   Left side more painful when palpated.  It seems to be going away slowly.   Did not put this on my daily  report because I chalked this up to being maybe a cold or something coming on.  After thinking about this symptom I realized it is slowly going away and as an R.N. contributed to it now as a side effect.  Below I put &#34;No&#34; regarding recovery because the pain is still there however not as bad.  It seems to be going away slowly.  Hoping it will be gone in a few more days.

                                                As soon as she injected the vaccine into my arm I immediately felt a burning sensation go down the inside of my arm to my wrist. It lasted about 5 minutes. I felt fine the rest of the day. The next day I developed a burning sensation in my tongue, mouth throat and chest. Then weakness in my chest and dificulting breathing. It is Saturday April 10, 2021 and the symptoms still come and go. The burning sensations mostly at night. The chest weakness and breathing issues seem to be in the morning and when I exercise. These symptoms are not as bad as they were initially but still present. I am unable to get an answer when I ask if the burning down my are is normal when getting a vaccine. No one else that I have talked with has experienced this symptom.  I emailed my doctor she suggested taking tylenol.

Started as a small area on 03/16/21 then expanding to cover my entire left forarm from my elbow to my wrist by 03/18/21.  I sent a phot to a friend that works for a doctor &amp; was told to have it seen ASAP.  My doctor was out of the office that day (Friday March 19th) my insurance company told me to go to the ER.  I went ,  They diagnosed it as cellullitis on my left arm and also an allergic uticaria on my right arm.  I was prescribed Cephalexin 500 mg &amp; Prednisone 20 mg &amp; Claitin D.  The area cleared up, however it is coming back. I currently have an area of red, itchy and a little swollen of approxiamately 3&#34; x 3 1/2&#34; on my right arm.

                                                Approximately 21 days after receiving vaccine I started to have symptoms of what was later diagnosed to be shingles.  My skin was very sensitive to even wearing clothes and I thought I had bites on the back of my neck into my hairline because we had been on Nantucket.  But I could not see it.  I was feeling very fatigued and had pain from my left ear down my left arm and side.   I did not think it could be shingles because  I received the Shingrix vaccines in 2019.  Finally I had my husband take a picture of it and sent it to me PCP ON 4/8/2021.  She informed me it was shingles and put me on a prescription (not sure of name for 1 week).  Because nerve pain in neck and ear still continues I was prescribed Gabapentin which I am still taking.

About a week later I noticed a huge black bruise on my L  hip with a knot in the middle of it - it is still there but much lighter. Some days later I noticed a bruise on my R knee. Today I noticed a bruise on my R forearm. I do take a low does aspirin every day. I did get a little dizzy a couple of times and when I look up I get vertigo - not sure if that is related.

                                                The injection site felt &#34;achey&#34; immediately after the injection and this discomfort lasted several hours despite my gently massaging the band-aid site. My left arm felt &#34;heavy&#34; for the rest of the day. Within 18 hours of vaccination, I was awaken from sleep shaking violently. I thought that someone was shaking me violently. When I realized that my body was shaking so, I wrapped myself in a comforter; then I passed out or went back to sleep. When I was aware of myself again, I was too hot wrapped in the comforter and removed it. I was very concerned about what had happened to me so I moved slowly getting up and starting my day. I live alone so there was no one to help or advise me. For the next few days, I rested often, not sleeping, just feeling the need to lay about.   By week 2 after the injection, I was &#34;dragging&#34; but not sleeping. When I laid down, my mind roamed about, when I tried to read or engage in meaningful activities were not successful.  By week 3, I have full-blown insomnia. I go to bed at 4 am to be awake for hours while in bed, then being exhausted during the day. I am normally active, but I do not have the stamina to do what I love such as mowing my own lawn and working in garden. My heart rate jumps to 122 after 10-20 minutes of activities when in the past I could work steadily for 40 minutes and my heart rate never get above 90 beat per minute ( I  wear a charge 2 watch that monitors exercise parameters.) I had to stop to rest up to 4 times to complete the yard work that I could normally complete in less than 40 minutes.  Currently, I have &#34;hay fever&#34; symptoms: itchy runny nose, tickle in the throat with dry cough, tired, runny eyes  and frontal headache; I take benadryl  and other allergy medicines. I have poor sleep habits.

There are also welts on the top of my thighs, where coloration is more blotchy.   After a couple days I realized I was having small episodes of near-fainting.  I would have the sensation that I was was going to faint, and it went away without any fainting or dizziness.  It was a warning sensation.  This occurred 10-15 times a day.  It would grab my attention &amp; be gone just as quickly.  The same weekend I started with the rash, my anxiety level rose very high.  I felt a motor in my chest all the time.

                                                observed injection site that afternoon when removing bandage:  my upper arm was full of tiny pinpoint dots, injection site was swollen/hard.  I was busy that day finishing payroll and preparing for trip .  I did not notice so much in the morning, I drove to visit family for a few days.   Upon return home, I read the paperwork provided by the clinic after I had received the shot...and began examining my body for tiny blood spots.  Now, with each shower  etc I would notice random spots and try to remember if they  had been there before...  My doctor was retiring and called last weekend to followup on a lab test he had previously  ordered to take in May.   During that conversation I asked him about the random spots, and he made an appt for me to see the  PA  the next day and do my urine sample for the lab order.   PA ordered bloodwork for low platelet counts, which I had had previously,  and urine test for abnormal immunofixation.

I was not concerned as I have them on occasion. I felt fine. Went to bed that evening and woke up with extreme burning and itching in my index finger and thumb of my right hand. Also a very large hive on the inside of my arm about 2 1/2 inches from my wrist bend. Intense itching.  I took a Benadryl tablet and felt better almost immediately. Later in the day about 6 1/2 hours later, I had more itching on my hip where the high was located. I took another Benadryl. I am fine. I also call my doctor and reported it.

However , 18 days after my vaccination, around April 2, 2021,  began to have deep muscle pain radiating around the injection site, which was in my upper right arm, in the muscle at the top of my arm.. It was SO painful,  the pain was deep in the muscle but not painful to external touch., that I had to take Tylenol for three days. Today is April 7, 2021, and the deep muscle pain is barely noticeable, but once in awhile, I will still get a jab of pain..

                                                First, the injection was far more painful than anticipated (and it bled down my arm).  My arm immediately ached intensely.  Approximately 10 minutes after injection, I began to sweat profusely, followed by intensifying extreme lightheadedness. I could not stand, or lift my head, as I would have definitely passed out.  My shoulders and neck became extremely painful, as if ?frozen?, also preventing me from lifting my head.  After about 35 minutes I very gradually began to recover. It was about an hour before I began to move around normally.   Pharmacy and store staff  debated calling the paramedics, but I refused.  FYI, I had not been especially anxious about the vaccine, and I have never experienced such a reaction to anything in my life. It was a traumatic experience I would not wish to repeat.

Throughout the day the swelling continued on the left side of face, then on bottom of right foot and later on top of both feet.  Went to emergency room and was treated for hives.  Over the next five days, the hives kept moving around, the right side of face, and then to upper lip.  I followed up with my Primary Care Doctor, who did extensive allergy testing.  All came back negative.  I felt that it was a result of my body reacting to the vaccine.  In addition, I was feeling weak muscles and joints that kept moving around.

This appears to be shingles with the distribution and vesicles that were fluid-filled. She was given prednisone orally. I am seeing her 5 days later and she has a scabbed over rash in a dermatomal distribution that still stings and burns. No other contact dermatitis risk factors. I think this is Herpes Zoster.

Body aches and stiffness, affected my walking.  Did not take temperature at that time.  Got back into bed with 2 blankets and a comforter and still couldn&#39;t sleep.  Got up a 7AM - temp 102.2, shaking less but still  feeling cold, body was hot to touch.  I had a bad headache and body aches and stiffness were still there. I noticed at that time  that I had a bright red flush on both cheeks and my nose that was hot to the touch.  Took 600mg of Ibuprofen.  Went back to bed feeling terrible.  At 12 noon I got back up and temp was down to 99.7.  Headache, body aches, stiffness, and &#34;red flush&#34; still on cheeks and nose.  Went back to bed.  Took more Ibuprofen at 7pm - temp was down to 98.7.  Headache was better, body aches improved.  Flushed hot face was still present.  Went to  sleep at 11:30PM  and slept for 10 hours.  Today, 03/06/21, all symptoms improved, no fever, redness of face is still present but less.

Taking extra celecoxib, heat, resting has provided some improvement but still having problems 3 weeks later.

                                                Had vaccine at 2:15 in the afternoon on 4/1/2021. That night in bed had mild itching on tops of both legs, thought it was dry skin.  Next morning I noticed red splotches on both legs from top of thigh to just below knee, front and sides (not on back of legs). That night about 10:30 I woke up with severe itching and hives on the same areas of both legs.  Bumps and red splotches and very hot.  Called Hospital and told me to take a Benadryl and go to ER if I experienced swelling of tongue or difficulty breathing.  I had neither.  I only had Cetirizine Hydrochloride 10 mg so I took one of those. Itching went away in about 1/2 hour.  Got Benadryl next day and Cortisone cream.  Red splotches are lessening each day but definitely still there.  It doesn&#39;t itch during the day only at night. So I am still taking the Benadryl before bed.  I had no other side effects besides the hives.  No fever, no headache, no body ache, no pain at injection side, no chills.  The vaccine did sting when going in and lasted a few minutes after.  I had no other changes that might cause this. Didn&#39;t work outside, clothes the same, eating the same, nothing different that would trigger this.

I woke up (Wed.) with  NAUSEA and took the &#34;anti-nausea&#34; pills that I had left over from when I had COVID (11 - 2020).  My upper arm was now very sore, especially when I tried to lift it.  I took my temp. and I had a FEVER (101). On Thurs., my temp. went down to 99.5 and the nausea was gone.  Today (Fri.), I woke up with pain on my shoulder (over the injection site). I took Advil and iced it and it is now much better (this eve.). The only side effect I have now is the pain in my arm (mostly when I lift it). I am eating better and sleeping better now.

                                                The left arm where the shot was given was only sore for a short time, but my right are began to ache the next day.  It seems to be in the muscle between the elbow and shoulder.  I can use my arm, but grasping items and raising them above my shoulder are very painful (like holding my hair dryer and raising it to dry my hair).  I have debated with myself about reporting this, but with the current concern with the Johnson and Johnson - one shot, I thought maybe I should report it.

                                                Patient with questions /concerns-said she had to get vaccine because of recent dx/tx for breast cancer. She said received vaccine on 3/13- then on 3/16 she was seen for one of her breast cancer therapy sessions- they have been treating her for lymphedema - she said she has been going for breast cancer in July- no chemo just radiation- surgery of breast with removal of seven surrounding lymph nodes. She was advised to wear a compression bra- on 3/16 and ever since then her left side of neck has been sore- thought it was likely related to compression bra not fitting correctly b/c too tight &amp; was professionally fitted on her- the straps seem very tight over the collar bone area that was damaged/irritated by the radiation she received on that side up through Oct 2020 for cancer. Now when she saw story today in news she got concerned could the neck soreness really be from a blood clot? She as been going the week for tightness in neck to physical therapy which started yesterday for lymphedema. Again her radiation ended Oct 2020 but she has had persistent swelling in breast &amp; fluid in lymph nodes on the left side. She still has pain in on collar bone- on same side of radiation- blisters, sore, red. As well as this new compression bra having two tight straps on each side. Her COVID vaccine shot in right arm but left side where breast surgery was She went on 3/16 for consultation on breast lymphadema - that was when told her to wear tighter bra for compression on 3/16. She is going today to be fitted for new one that is not so tight. She is approx. 4 weeks post vaccination &amp; post when started wearing that tighter bone- maybe three inches from where had radiation injury is located.

                                                The medication that was injected stung me. My arm just kept stinging, I kept ice packs on it all day. After 3 hours I started feeling very tired which lasted for days. The next day my left gland in my neck was swollen, arm was hot. I felt like I was getting a sinus headache. The gland kept swelling on and off for about a week.  The tiredness lasted for about three weeks. Developed a rash on my chest and lower back area. The doctor gave me a cream to use on the rash.

A month afterwards, I did have a couple days of extreme tiredness. Left eye blurriness and I changed my contact lens; but noticed there was double vision in the left eye- Ocular migraine - the optometrist thought it was like that. It lasted about five hours. During that time I did have blood test for Thyroid.

                                                5 pm on Sunday, I started getting pains on my lower leg. Not like an ache. All up and down the inside of the leg (the pain was). There was a pressure point where I found a point where if I pressed it, it was really painful. My skin - the inner leg towards the back - it was really really sensitive. If you touched it lightly it felt painful - not a searing pain. If I massaged it, it would go away but in a few minutes it would come back. I took an aspirin in case of a clot. At this time, I was thinking of deep vein thrombosis. Gradually, it went away. It lasted quite awhile - it lasted between 2 or three hours like this. Even now, the skin isn&#39;t sensitive, but I can still press that one point and it hurts. (That pressure point.) I went to the Doctor on the 13th, he sent me to an Ultrasound there wasn&#39;t a clot in the leg. That came out fine. When I had the IBS for four months (with a lot of diarrhea). I just found out yesterday that my magnesium was low and they gave me a drip for that. My potassium was a little low also. I had the magnesium drip last night - it was an Hospital ER visit - but it was for bloodwork that had been done yesterday to check me after IBS symptoms.

In the morning, her entire arm was covered in blood and her sheets wet. Her husband cleaned her up, and the next day, she did not have any bleeding.  But then the second night, again overnight, she bled heavily and woke up with her arm covered in blood and sheets wet with blood.  She also experienced leg pain so bad that she couldn&#39;t walk.  This happened after she had done some leg exercises in which she used a tension band.

There is a knot about the size of a large walnut at the injection site.  This has been there since about 10 days after shot was given and it is still somewhat tender in spots and it feels like a bruise.  I cannot lie on my right side comfortably.  I have not had any serious pain with this reaction and can lift my arm without discomfort.

                                                04/19/21 TELEPHONE CALL: I was asked to call this patient who has been experiencing a rash and swelling  since 4/9. She received the J&amp;J vaccine 4/8. Rash described as very itchy, starting on extremities, especially wrists, hands,  arms, legs, back. Not anterior trunk, not head or neck but head was itchy. She  had swelling where the rash was/is, no asymmetric swelling. Much of it has  resolved - she states it is &#34;much better&#34; now. Now the rash is mostly just on her  hands and wrists, with a little swelling. Her joints do not bother her. No headache, fever, pain other than usual achiness from her medical conditions  that include myasthenia gravis and DM. No flare or change in symptoms or state of  her chronic illnesses. She has been taking benadryl at night, 12.5 - 25 mg, since 4/11, and using  hydrocortisone cream on the rash. She has had a new puppy since  4/13. She gardens and works in her yard. She is active in walking, gardening,  weeding, and her activity has not decreased since this began. Although she could  have been exposed to weeds or plants in her yard that she might react to, she is  covered when she goes out, long pants, shirt, boots etc. She has not used any new  soaps, detergents, etc; cannot think of any new exposures. I offered medical evaluation here, but she is comfortable monitoring it at home  since it is getting better. I advised her to come in for evaluation if rash or  swelling became worse, asymmetric, or if new symptoms begin.

About 2 weeks after receiving the vaccination, my arm started hurting at the vaccination site. There is no redness, no swelling, nothing visible, just a pain inside; however, pain has increased. . I texted the CDC about this issue and received a fairly generic response.

What happened next, I had gone to ENT for my ear (5th) and he put me on heavy dose of Prednisone (6th). Following Tuesday, I was on Prednisone for ear. I was already really achy by then. On the third day after the Prednisone I fatigue, headaches and neck pain but I didn&#39;t have any other pain. I still couldn&#39;t hear though.  I was on this for almost 4 weeks and from them I started like I was having a hot flash and then I would get cold; sore throat; headaches heavy bones and achy muscles; earaches; fatigue; dizziness like you wouldn&#39;t believe. They were cyclical - I&#39;d have them for a couple days and then for about a half a day I&#39;d be a bit better and then it would start up again. The fatigues and dizziness didn&#39;t change when the other symptoms seemed to be a bit better. My hearing didn&#39;t start to clear until I went to see the 2nd ENT which was a couple of weeks down the road. I do not have the stamina I had before the vaccine - I&#39;m not sleeping well at night and I&#39;m always short of breath at any exertion. It is improving but it&#39;s slow. Again, the symptoms I experienced during cyclical times: Cold symptoms, runny nose, sore mouth, ringing in my ears was horrible; dizziness and short of breath - cyclical for three weeks. The Prednisone took away all my cramps and pain in my joints that I had before the vaccine. Currently: My heart feels like it&#39;s going 100 miles an hour at night in bed - chest discomfort at night. Legs blue in the shower. The week of the 28th, I was done with the Prednisone and then all the pain came back and more. I can&#39;t take an inflammatory - the pain is still there and my usual cramps came back.

About 24 hours AFTER the Janssen shot, rash began with red, itchy splotches on my face and neck.  Several hours later these areas became more numerous, more inflamed, so that by 48 hours later they resembled 3rd-degree burns b/c of their hotness and intensity.  Neck also broke out in hives, besides being red and inflamed.   The normal course for this whole reaction BEFORE the shot, was about a 5-6 day cycle, before the rash would start all over.  Since the shot, the intense burning reactions occur every other day, before the first &#39;burn&#39;/inflamed area is healed.  It is intensely itchy, painful, and non-stop hotness.

She said that it seemed to be getting worse and even moving toward the armpit. It did not start until several days after getting the vaccine. I advised her to contact her family physician. The family physician called in a prescription for Cephalexin 250 mg  four times daily for 10 days. She began taking the antibiotic Monday evening and I followed up with the patient Wednesday morning, 3/17/21. She said it was no longer as sore or red or hot to the touch. She was seeing her doctor again on Thursday morning to follow up.
