This redness , itching, swelling and warm to the touch has been going on since Sunday evening  and it is not Wednesday night and doesn?t look better yet.

                                                5:00 pm 3-9-21  I became instantly exhausted and had fatigue.  I got chills and ran a 99.8 fever.  I went to bed and about 5 hours later my fever broke and I felt fine in the morning when I woke up.  9:30pm  on 3-13-21 I found both of my thighs bright red.  It was not itchy, but it was warm to the touch.  7:45pm on 3-14-21  My butt cheeks were bright red and warm to the touch.  Then about 30 minutes later my thighs became red.  Everything red started itching was raised like hives.  I found three dots on my arm and later those spread into large spots of hives.  Then over the next 9 hours, a new spot would start, it would spread, then it would itch like crazy.  I took 25mg of Diphenhydramine at 8pm.  I took another 50mg at 10 when I was having no relief and it continued to spread.  At 1:15am both of my hands and wrists had hives and these hurt and itched the most because they were swollen and hard to bend.  At 3am both of my feet started to flair up.  Finally around 5am the hives stopped.  I was not able to sleep through it.  I did not ever have a fever, I checked that 4 times.  I also did not have trouble breathing or have any swelling on my face. 3-15-21 @ 9:20am I went to see my doctor.  All of my vitals were good.  All of my hives were gone.  He put me on Prednisone in case it came back and at 11am I took 4 pills and went to bed.  I woke up 2 hours later and my feet were itching again.  My left foot broke out in hives bad.   It lasted for over an hour.  My toes were hard to bend.   4:34pm on 3-15-21 currently I don&#39;t have any hives and I am tired.    I thoroughly thought through everything that I have eaten, worn, and used, and I have changed nothing over the past 2 weeks.

The chills subsided after about 2 hours, but then my resting heart rate went up to 110-120 bpm rather than the normal 75-85 for me. It felt like my heart was beating out of my chest even though I was laying down in bed. That lasted through the night and I felt back to normal around mid-morning.

After no side effects, I drove away.  Only to have a sudden reaction as I was driving.  I&#39;ve felt dizzy with flu vaccines before and have felt the same symptoms as with the covid vaccine when IV dye was injected for a CT scan 5 months ago.  Felt faint/ dizzy, Got severe tachycardia, thought my heart was gonna explode.  I drove back in a hurry, scared and confused. I was waiting to be seen, and no one ever came out.  Symptoms subsided on their own after 15 min, therefore I just left without notifying anyone.  2 hours after vaccine, my arm looked moderately red and swollen, with minimal pain.  7 hours after getting the vaccine I started with chills and body aches.  8 hours after getting the vaccine I felt feverish and malaise.  After taking Tylenol with feverish symptoms (didn&#39;t check temp) slept for 2 hours and felt a little better.

                                                I felt light headedness right away. The night that I got the injection, I felt kind of drunk. I felt like I had too much alcohol. I am very sensitive to things. I felt silly - loose - tired.  In the night, I had aches and chills - no fever. The next day I felt achy and really really tired. I had a pain at the injection site. That evolved into a left side migraine (the achiness and fatigue and pain from shot) It created tension up my arm and up my neck - and I did get nausea with the headache - on Saturday. Sunday, I felt a little bit better but energy was still low - unusual tiredness; couldn&#39;t exercise as I felt a heavy fatigue. On Sunday, I went to a dance class but it was difficult as I was tired. On Monday, I felt a tiny bit better but still fatigued and did another dance class which went a little better. On Monday evening, I felt like I did the night of the injection - a little loopy and &#34;drunk like.&#34; Monday night, I woke up with a Fiery, achy, itchy, burning rash on both of my arms and the tops of my legs. If I would itch it, it would exaggerate it. When I woke up the next day - the rash went everywhere in my body - it would come and go in different places - neck, face, down and up my legs and feet and on my butt. Pretty much every spot had the rash at one time or another. It was really bad on Tuesday morning, I called the doctor. Was treated with Benadryl and cortisone cream which helped with the symptoms. Tuesday night, it was excruciating - it was all up and down my legs, arms, neck and face and stomach and rear end and feet. It was very achy, burning and itchy - very intense. It would hurt if I scratched it. Accompanied with really intense fatigue. Wednesday, after taking Benadryl, I woke up and it was a tiny bit better. It was still on my legs, neck and face. Sometimes my arms would flare up and sometimes they wouldn&#39;t. Any kind of exertion - like my dance class - would trigger the rash - so I took a break from exercising that week.  It started getting incrementally better - very slowly. Still there on Thursday - still fatigued and I was still taking Benadryl. Friday, also. Saturday, it was pretty much gone but it would threaten to come back and I felt itchiness in my legs when I went for a walk. It still feels a little lingering - my legs are itchy. I&#39;m still building back my energy. Incrementally my energy is increasing. Still not 100% there but it&#39;s getting better day by day.  Note: My history with my skin: I do get flare ups when I get bug bites and when I get poison ivy - I have very sensitive skin.

                                                In addition to the known side effects of extreme fatigue, low grade fever and body aches, I also have right arm pain at the site of injection with right arm swelling, warmth and right axilla swelling and tenderness.  The arm pain was began immediately at the time of injection and did initially lessen some for the first 12 hours until it started worsening mid-morning 22-24 hours after the injection.  Around 26 hours after the injection the arm pain worsened such that it couldn&#39;t be ignored and the axilla pain became very prominent almost worse than the arm pain.  Upon inspection I noticed obvious swelling and pain in my right axilla.  The right arm and axilla pain has persisted and worsened over the last 2 days to now include upper biceps, upper triceps, lower deltoid, trapezius, clavicular and right lateral breast pain.  The axilla and arm swelling has persisted and worsened over the last two days to now include swelling in my upper arm, around my clavicle, my upper chest and upper back.  The initial axilla swelling has not decreased any and is more prominent than any of the swelling located elsewhere.  Of note, I cannot easily palpate any axilla, clavicular or cervical lymph nodes.  If there is lymp involvement the nodes are not appearing to be extremely swollen with palpation exam.

                                                Around 6 hours after vaccine, I had uncontrollable chills. This led to a low grade fever. I tried to sleep it off, but woke up with my heart racing- My resting BPM was around 120. My skin was super sensitive. I started taking 2 extra strength Tylenol every 6 hours around 5pm, and that helped a little. I couldn&#39;t focus on anything- I could basically stare at the wall while my heart was hammering. I finally slept, and woke up soaked in sweat with my fever broken (my fever never got above 99) around 2am, and improved steadily after that.

                                                My vaccine was administered at 12:30pm. I waited until 12:55 at CVS after the vaccine to make sure there were no reactions. I also move my arm around a lot after the injection to keep it from hurting. I drove home, at lunch and about 2:45 was hit with a very noticeable headache. I never get headaches and eat healthy and consume about a gallon of water a day. I knew it wasn&#39;t from dehydration or being hungry.  Headache was in the temple area and made my eyes hurt in the same way they would if you had cried for an extended period of time or were overtired. At 3pm a wave of exhaustion hit me. I was sitting working trying to combat the headache and felt almost wiped out. I got through the rest of my work day (4:30) and went to lay down immediately. I passed out almost instantly until 7 pm. I work up and showered, ate dinner and started to feel a little warm. It should be noted it was an unseasonably warm day and got up to 77, so it was a tiny bit warm in my home. I put on loose fitting clothes and slayed on the couch still with the bad headache and the injection site started to throb so I placed and ice pack on for 20 minutes. I could only stay awake until 8:45 and got in bed. I could not get comfortable for several hours feeling very warm. I tried a fan on high and drinking more water but i felt very warm like how you feel with the flu. I took my temp at 1130pm it was normal. I continued to toss and turn and feel very warm and slightly dizzy, in the sense that I hadn&#39;t been able to sleep and with the headache my body was just exhausted. Around 2 am i woke up for more water and got in the shower because I had sweated so much my sheets were wet and my clothes. I got out of the shower around 10 minutes later, changed and got new sheets and got back in bad. Around 330 I felt very hot again and opened the windows and got another ice pack for my arm which was throbbing again. I finally fell asleep after 3:45am. I got up for work at 6am. I felt slightly foggy, and very hot. But no fever. My temp is normally around 97.4-97.9 and it was 98.4. Still normal but I was running warmer than usual. It took a long time to get ready and despite hot water in the shower I was freezing. i got dress and debated going to work. Got in the car at 6:45 and my drive to work is 30 minutes. 1/2 way into my drive I got very sweaty again and went home to change my clothes because they were too warm. Got to work around 7:20 and still felt warm but they take our temps at the door and min was still okay, no fever. I drank a lot of water and ate, and at 8:30 am all of a sudden the exhaustion was gone and I felt normal. I got home form work at 5:30p and took a 3 hour nap and felt normal again.

                                                Pain in arm immediately upon injection. Extreme dizziness, light-headedness, and a warm flush came over me within 2-3 minutes. Sat down on a chair, put my head between my knees. Wasn&#39;t helping so I sat down on the floor cross-legged and put my head to the ground to try to keep myself from fainting. A medic noticed I wasn&#39;t doing well and took me to a tent on the other side of the large room to lie down. She asked if I wanted a wheelchair and I declined. I barely made it to the tent to lie down before I would have fainted. Lying down was significantly better than sitting down. After staying prone for about 20 minutes, I was doing better so I left. Immediately after walking outside and feeling cool fresh air I was much much better. Dull headache approximately 19hrs after shot that lasted half a day.  48hrs post shot had tingling and numbness in injection arm that lasted about a day. Injection arm soreness for 3 days total.

(Not normal )  This lasted two days.  Intense chills/shivering. Night sweats, nausea.  This was the night of the injection.  Headache. Everyday since  injection.  Throbbing in left temple.   Muscular pain, left deltoid. This has increased since day of injection.   Redness, swelling, pain  at injection site that has intensified since injection. (No other indicators of it being an infection. Not warm to touch, no oozing or bleeding or any type of fluid.)   Left  forearm  muscle pain, left wrist pain- almost like a dull ache going down arm.

Within an hour began to feel like I had taken a sedative (reminded me of how klonopin made me feel when I was taking it for anxiety).  Sedative type feeling lasted for approximately 4 hours.  Headache developed approximately 2 hours after receiving vaccination.  Headache and nausea persisted until bedtime.  Had major issues sleeping and had night sweats all night.  Nausea is gone this morning but headache is still present.  Some mild tenderness at injection site that is still present this morning.

The next morning  15 hours after vaccine my arm started to hurt so badly I could barely move. The nerves in the injected arm running up and down with shooting and  pulsing, lack of feeling in hands and extreme pain through the the arm and shoulder on the injected side.  The pain was extreme for 13 days I lost work time. I saw several doctors who sent me on my way. My arm still hurts right now 24 days since vaccine. The pain is not extreme but the nerves still shoot pain and oils and there is often extreme pain by the end of the day.

                                                Patient had covid19 vaccine yesterday in her left arm. Today, she noted some swelling at the base of her neck on the left and it is quite tender to touch. The upper arm is only mildly tender. The vaccine was Johnson and Johnson. She has no breathing difficulties and no trouble swallowing. No fever, chills or myalgia. No chest pain.   Acute onset. Stable. She has no evidence of airway compromise or difficulty swallowing. This does not appear to be lymphadenopathy. I want her to monitor closely. Apply ice to area as directed on after visit summary. Acetaminophen for pain. If enlarges with any evidence of airway compromise at all, she must go directly to Emergency Department or call 911. I encouraged her to report this on VAERS site for adverse vaccine reaction.  As of 4/11 1:41pm pain at collarbone is same, but swelling is down a bit. Injection site is now very tender/ painful to touch.

Today is Wednesday, almost a week after with leg pain, headache, swollen arm, and weird feeling.

                                                On April 8th at 4am, I woke up feeling a strong pain in my heart / esophagus region. I was alone and out of town and didn&#39;t know what to do, so I just sat in the hotel bed and waited for morning to come. I didn&#39;t know if i was having a heart attack or if it was gas from drinking soda the previous day. I went to work. At work, the left side of my tongue suddenly started swelling and a tingling and numbness set in my upper lip. I was very scared, rushed to the drugstore and bought GasX, Ricola drops (my throat was slightly sore, too) and Allegra 24 hours. I immediately took the Allegra pill but still went to the hospital. When getting to the parking of the hospital, though, the anti-allergic started kicking in and the tongue started getting back to normal, so I went back to work and didn&#39;t enter the hospital. I was ok for a while. Hours later, rashes started showing all over my body. Starting in my arms then under my breasts. On the night of the 8th, I even had fever and chills. Still, I had to go to work so it was a real nightmare. I also had diarreah. I then went to the drugstore again and also bought regular and night Advil, lots of water and electrolytes drink, Peptobismol and Benadryl (only Allegra was not enough). The following day, April 9th, the rashes started spreading all over my body, the fever was only being controlled by Advil. I flew back to Miami and was bedridden until the April the 11th. On the night of April the 11th I still woke up with very strong headache and on the 12th spent the day with a headache, but since have gotten better.

                                                One week post injection I developed a rash a couple inches below where the injection was received that spread down my outer arm (to a little above my hand).  Within a few hours the same rash appeared on my other arm the same way.  I later realized it was also on my stomach and sides down to my upper thighs.  Those rashes were gone within 12 hours or so.  I did continue to get small rashes on my inner thighs and small rashes or itchy spots on my lower legs and ankles for a week or so.

The following day body aches increased, numbness on the left side of my face and right lower leg, hives on my chest, neck and face, debilitating fatigue.

The only remaining symptom is the numbness in my face and leg. There is occasionally pain in my leg (feels like nerve pain).

                                                The first few days, I had flu-like symptoms. After I got the vaccine - my migraines became very severe - they would last for days. They became unmanageable and I had to go to ER.  I have asthma - it&#39;s a lot harder to breathe - this is on and off. It used to be once in awhile I need my inhaler but now I need to use it more. It feels like I&#39;m catching my breath a lot more now.. My rashes went away - but I had had rashes (random places - arms/legs) that came and went for the first two weeks after the vaccine. I went to hospital ER on the 12th of April - because my migraines were so bad that my blood pressure went up to 200 something and they had to clear me to make sure I wasn&#39;t having a stroke. I have always had migraines but the only thing different that has changed the severity is the vaccine. I just finished off the steroids&#39; - Progesterone that the neurologist (at ER)(the one that called the cold stroke) prescribed to me. But that didn&#39;t really help. I&#39;m waiting for approval from insurance for another medication. Saw another neurologist - after the ER visit.

He said the patient experienced fever of 101 and tingling/sharp prickling of the face the night of the vaccine and the following morning. She took an unknown fever reducer with success.  The following day her legs began looking dark and bruised and she was numb and tingling in the legs. As of today (the next day), the bruising (dark color) has reduced and she only has slight numbness and tingling in the legs. He said she had back surgery 3 weeks ago so is unsure of the cause.  We informed him that she should be taken to a doctor as soon as possible to rule out the possibility of blood clotting. He acknowledged and said they will discuss immediately when he gets home and either take her to the ER or keep a close eye on her and take her to PCP on Monday morning.

                                                The day after the vaccination, 3/16, I noticed red irritated skin on the back of my right hand and wrist.  It did not itch or feel irritated, just noticed that it was red and thought I might have scratched it on something.  The next day, 3/17, I woke up to see that the irritated area now had blisters and I felt a burning sensation in that area.  I also noticed a few of the red patches and one blister on the underside of my right forearm.   I took Benedryl which seemed to help with the burning feeling. Today, 3/18, it now is less red, but the blisters are still present.  It does not burn and I have not taken any more medication for it.

                                                Low back pain began about 6 hours after shot.  Next morning, 12 hours after shot, woke with muscle aches, headache, chills and sweating.  Approximately 18 hours after shot, hives began to appear at wrists, thighs.  About the same time, diarrhea occurred twice, and severe dizziness occurred.  Likely brief loss of consciousness occurred, resulting in fall due to sudden dizziness upon standing.  Hives became progressively worse, became severe and full-body.  Called doctor, who instructed us to go to ER for IV steroids and additional care.

The allergy meds helped but once they wore off I would start itching. Two days after the shot my face got really puffy especially around the eyes. For six days I took 2 Zyrtec in the morning and 1 benadryl at night. After 6 days of the allergy meds I finally was back to normal.

                                                Started with chills shortly after getting the injection, which got progressively worse. At 9:30 pm, the evening of injection, chills got worse, along with a headache and muscle aches that started with my shoulders and moved quickly down my body, eventually, ending at my toes. It hurt to move, even my fingers. I took 2 regular strength Tylenol, which helped get me to sleep. I then woke up around 4 am in a puddle of sweat... I took my temp and no fever, but body aches, headache and chills were still prevalent. I spent the next day in bed without moving or eating much - drank a lot of water. Tylenol every six hours. An hour after taking Tylenol, I seemed to be well enough to not be moaning and groaning, but it wore off too quickly and I had two hours of feeling horrible before taking more Tylenol for a bit of relief. I woke Sunday morning around 5 am in another puddle of sweat and severe body aches and headache. I took more Tylenol, went back to sleep and woke around 9 am feeling groggy, but quickly realized that I was feeling 100% better! Just like that. I also had pain at the injection site that for some reason seems to be getting worse today, Sunday (April 4). I do not have swelling or redness. It just feels hot and very very sore and getting worse. Heavy and hard to lift.

As the minutes passed, the feeling of fullness was more pronounced. We offered EPI-PEN and to call 911. Patient wanted 911 only. We called 911, took her blood pressure (188/119). Paramedics arrived within 1 minute. After examination, patient was transported to hospital at 1:30p.m. accompanied by family members. At 3:55p.m.,  I spoke to her fiancé to inquire about her well being. She was still at ER at 3:55 p.m. She was given Benadryl, EpiPen, and Prednisone. Fiancé said she was breathing better but there was a rash and itching at injection site which was being treated with Benadryl and Prednisone. Fiancé said patient was frustrated at having to be at emergency room.

                                                On 4-8-21 at approx 2:30am I woke up with chills, nausea and severe diarrhea. I began experiencing severe abdominal pain in belly button as if it were on fire. Hurt to take deep breaths. Developed hives all over body and very itchy. Scheduled phone call with triage nurse at 11:15am and then a follow up call again with my primary care doctor immediately following. At approx 1:22pm my primary care doctor told me to go to urgent care or ER due to concern of me going into anaphylactic shock. Immediately went to Emergency Room and admitted after waiting in waiting room for over 5 hrs. After bloodwork and CT Scan of abdomen my appendix was perforated and needed to be removed immediately. Immediately sent to OR for surgery at 11pm.

Internal rotation, weakness in left ankle. It happened again as I walked shortly after. That day I tripped many times due to weakness in that ankle. When I showered and shaved my legs I realized that I had absolutely no feeling in the left lateral part of my lower leg. It felt like I had a novocaine injection in my leg. I could not even feel a pin prick there. By Friday 4/9/2021 I started to have some sensation, but still decreased sensation and weakness in my left ankle even at this moment.  ****4 WEEKS AFTER THE SHOT**** My period started Monday, April 5th, 2 days early. By Friday, 4/9/2021 and through the day and night Saturday 4/10/2021, I had such a heavy period that I kept soaking through tampons, pads, and 2 pairs of jeans. I have never blead like that and could not keep up.

                                                With prior vaccines and flu shots, I have either had no side effects or mild.  But with the COVID vaccine, I was sicker than sick!  I wasn&#39;t expecting to miss as much work as I did, nor go to the doctor three times in a week&#39;s time.  I received it around 11:30am on Thursday, March 18.  Around 1pm, my mild headache started to intensify and had ringing in my ears that would repeatedly come and go (still is doing so today, just not as frequent).  Around 4pm is when all of the &#34;normal&#34; side effects started?chills, hot flashes, sore arm, and super sleepy.  I woke up a couple hours later, with a headache that was WAY worse and was super nauseous.   This was close to 10pm.  Then, around 11pm that same night, I developed HORRID shooting ear pains and took my first Tylenol.  The ear/jaw pain was more than I could stand - had it in both ears, but the right ear was more intense.  It felt like I had a lighting rod between both ears and had these intense &#34;zings&#34; that kept going back and forth, like they were playing ping-pong.  The painful &#34;zings&#34; reminded me of those felt during an ear infection but WAY MORE INTENSE.  My jaw was super tight, as well, with a horribly intense headache.  I spent the entire night night doing warm compresses on my ears, taking Tylenol every 4-6 hours, staying in the shower, and lots of crying.  It was so bad that I felt the need to go to the ER but didn&#39;t feel comfortable driving and didn&#39;t want to go the ambulance route?and thought it was pointless because going to the ER for ear pain would leave me there for hours and hours since I didn&#39;t feel it would be viewed an an urgent emergency.  My goal was to make it through the night and see if I could get into my PCP doctor the following morning.  I took another Tylenol around 5am, and I thankfully cried myself to sleep for a couple of hours.  When I woke up, I called my PCP but couldn&#39;t get in, so I did an online doctor visit through my insurance company.  My fever was about 103.06 at its highest during the night but was gone by 3:34pm Friday afternoon (assuming because I was taking more Tylenol than I had been post-online doctor&#39;s appointment).  Around 7pm Friday evening, I knew I needed to go to the ER or urgent care.  I got a ride and was taken to urgent care for my intense ear pain.  They gave me a Toradol injection and Tramadol prescription.  By bedtime Friday night, the injection was doing its job and made the ear pain and zings were much less intense (didn&#39;t get the prescription until a couple days later).  On March 20, Saturday night, is when I developed a red, itchy rash on my back and tummy.  Over the next couple of days, it was on my chest, arms, legs?pretty much come and was in various places.  I called my PCP Monday morning (March 22), left a message, and they called me back to tell me to restart taking my Zyrtec/HCL to see if it would help the itching.  It has and am just mildly breaking out at this time.  The stinkin&#39; ear/jaw pain returned on Tuesday the 23rd, so I loaded up on OTC ear drops and made an appointment with my PCP for Wednesday, March 24.  She saw no ear infection and essentially told me to keep taking the pain meds.  I received the vaccine on March 18 and did not return to work until the following Thursday.  In retrospect, I should have just missed the remainder of that week, too.

                                                When I first got the shot I noticed it in my throat. I told the nurses they had me wait 20 minutes before I could leave. I felt dizzy but not dizzy enough to not go home. It felt like it went to my stomach, then my head, and then I could feel it in my joints.  I drove home from the city. Two hours pass, I notice a rash but I didn&#39;t think anything of it due to indoor allergens, springtime plus it went away within an hour.   I started to get chills and fever. I had a lack of sleep due to pain throughout the first night. I was waking up feeling like my head was on fire from my ears to the top of the skull area and in front of my face by my eyes too. My eyes felt like they were going to burst. I layed in bed for 24 hours.   Day two: pain, tiredness, headache, and sensitivity to light for the next few days. Symptoms come and go for days then wean off.   Next, I had issues with anxiety, sleeping, yet being really tired as well coupled with problems sitting still. These are subsiding but still there.  I am still very tired today and a bit anxious on April 13th, 2021. I also notice my typing skills, as well as testing skills, are not as sharp as before the vaccination.

                                                P/C from patient. States she took the vaccine on 4/1/21 @ 1:30 PM. When she heard of the issues that were in the news about the vaccine she thought she should call.  4/1/21 Thursday: That evening around 6 PM she started to have a rash. It started on her L arm where she got her vaccination traveled up her neck, covered her face and trunk. It started out as an itchy red rash but became raised hives. It resolved on it&#39;s own and on Saturday she did not have the rash anymore. Never had any difficulty with breathing. Her left arm where she received her vaccination still has some discoloration. States on Thursday evening she started having a &#34;brain fog&#34;.   4/2/21 Friday: The next morning she woke up and was unable to finish a sentence, states she was confused, &#34;felt like I was on pain medication, like I was drugged&#34;. States she was confused, could not think and could not remember anything. Cried all day over nothing. Would tell her daughter something and then immediately ask what did I just say as she couldn&#39;t remember what she said. She was working on the graduation hooding ceremony and scribbled all over her papers like a 3 year old and the papers were strewn all over the floor. She reports that she had a mild headache all over her head dull pain and pressure 4/10. Took tylenol but that didn&#39;t help at all. Denies having any visual problems, trouble breathing or chest pain. Did have some abdominal dull cramping with nausea and even though it felt like she was going to have diarrhea there was no diarrhea or vomiting . The abdominal pain went away after friday but the nausea stayed through Sunday.She states she got lightheaded if she stood up too fast or turned her head too fast. This just happened on Friday. Denies having any weakness, lack of coordination, or speech issues. She states she was crying and could not stop all day on Friday. She told her boss she was having a mental breakdown and had to go home.  4/3/21 Saturday: Patient states she felt stupid, could not think, could not remember anything she said. States that the horrible headache came on Saturday. It was so bad she had to lay down in a dark room with a wet washcloth over her eyes. The horrible headache.lasted about 1 hour at a 10/10 level. Took some more tylenol but does not think it helped. Went to sleep and when she woke up the headache was still there at a rete of 4/10. She was still nauseate but the crying had resolved.  4/4/21 Sunday: Again, had a  severe migraine when she woke up. 7/10, not as bad as the one on Saturday. It lasted a couple of hours and then went back to the 4/10 headache that has persisted at the 3-4/10 level the entire time since she got her vaccination. The headache never stops hurting and stays 3-4/10.   4/5/21 Monday: Had a regular headache 3-4/10. Still felt &#34;loopy&#34; and with brain fog.  Went to work on Monday and told her boss about it and that she still says she can&#39;t think straight. Her boss has been very supportive and has helped her to complete her assignments to get them in on time.   4/6/21 Tuesday: Still had a  headache, It has been continuous ever since Friday. Still taking Tylenol and it doesn&#39;t seem to help. Yesterday she even tried Ibuprofen and it didn&#39;t help.   4/13/21 Today is day 13 and she still can&#39;t think straight. still has 3-4/10 headache, still all over her head. Feels that she still has brain fog, but not as &#34;loopy&#34;. Feels like she can remember what she has said better.   She called the nurse line at her husband&#39;s work.They told her that it was just a reaction to the vaccine. The patient didn&#39;t think to report it to the Health Center.  She got the vaccine from the Health Center (she asked if employees could get the vaccine and said she would prefer that)  She is not pregnant.  She has no chronic health conditions and takes no medications routinely  She denies being allergic to any medications and states she has taken the Flu shot without any reaction in the past.  NOTE: Tested positive for COVID on 2/4/21 and was told it was OK to get the vaccine. She lost her taste and smell and said she felt she had a mild flu for a couple of days. Has regained her sense of taste and smell and has had no residual symptoms.   Instructed patient to go to the ER for an exam. She needs a full neuro exam and at least a C_T scan of the head. She would like to contact her Primary Care Provider. States she hasn&#39;t seen him for a couple of years but feels like he would want to know. Instructed patient to call me with the outcome of her visit to her PCP or the ER. Patient verbalized understanding of and agreement with plan.

                                                Injection given very high on left shoulder. When injection started?burning pain went through the shoulder and then followed bloodflow down left arm to fingers, back up arm, down left side of back of neck, down the back, down the back of the left leg to foot, and back up to the middle of body before the burning no longer followed a path. Upon standing, I was dizzy, and told the pharmacist, and I told her that something felt wrong. She asked me to wait outside the pharmacy, standing, for 10 minutes. I was shivering and visibly shaking. Immediately after the injection, the burning on the left side persisted for over 30 min, and was over the whole left side of my body.  I could not move my shoulder joint without a lot of pain. The pain has gotten worse each day, around the shoulder.....pain in the rest of my body has lessened.

                                                March 9, 2021: 3:30am:  Woke up with chills and feeling very cold 7:00am:  Woke up with fever of up to 103F and extreme fatigue and headache which lasted during the day.  To ease the symptoms I took Tylenol every 6 hours. 10:00am:  Started noticing hives, first on my left shin and continued to manifest in my torso/back as well as forearms.  I called my physician via telehealth and I was advised to take Benadryl as needed.  Took Benadryl twice (6 hours apart) and the hives calmed down and eventually went away during the course of the day.  March 14, 2021 1.30am:  Woke up with itchy hives on my torso and back.  Took Benadryl once again.  I called my physician and was instructed to take Cetirizine for the next couple of days (10mg at 1x per day).  Symptoms subsided.  March 23, 2021 4:00am:  Woke up with itchy hives on the left side of my torso and across my back and my groin area and upper thighs.  Called my physician once again who instructed to take Cetirizine for a course of 2 weeks.  No symptoms while taking Cetirizine.  Stopped taking Cetirizine on April 2.  April 6, 2021 6:00am. Woke up with itchy red patches (with very small bumps) in localized areas of the body (ie on my hand, on my right leg, and areas near my armpits.  These lasted a little while with intense itchiness...would subside to just having red patches, and another area of the body would manifest red itchy patches.    The above lasted several days as I wanted to see if this would go away on its own.   On April 9th, called my physician to advise of the continued itchy patches which seem to come and go in different areas.  Advised to take Cetirizine once again for another 2 weeks once a day.

                                                Numbness starting from the injection site (upper left arm) and surrounding area, noticed about a week after the shot. Then numbness continued progressing down my upper arm, and into the front of my lower arm. This is accompanied by pins and needles kind of tingling and an intermittent heavy aching feeling along my entire left arm (picture the feeling of dental numbing wearing off).   On 4/14/2021, I noticed the numbness is now also in my left thumb.  Arm appears to function normally at this time, but worried about the increasing loss of sensation.  Went to doctor who performed a complete blood count and recommended monitoring  as she felt nothing could be immediately done.

My throat starts to swell, it?s hard to swallow. I start coughing profusely.  Later that evening came the chills, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea. That lasted 3 days. On day 8 I had severe pain down my arm. The same as the pain I had before I had my cervical spine fusion. On day 11 I had severe down my leg. Again the same type of pain I had before having lumbar spine surgery.  I?m on day 12 as I?m writing this.

                                                As soon as I took the vaccine shot I had an immediate headache, after taking the vaccine I took Tylenol and slept in the rest of the day. The next day I woke up and my arm was red and swollen. I was running fever, still had the headache and now blurry vision. My entire body was hurting. My left side of my body felt numb and tingling. The next two days the pain became worse. I did not really have an appetite. When I did eat I could barely hold my food down. On Wednesday morning I could barely get out of bed, I also felt extreme pain in my lower legs, stabbing pain in stomach and right lower side. I also had ringing in my ears, more in the right ear. I then notice a bruise on my left leg, that it was not originally there, and was also tender to touch. I went to the emergency room on the same day and I was admitted. I was in there for 4 days, they tested my leg and stated it was not a blood clot, although it look and felt like one. They discharge me and advise me that it was a migraine that was causing all my pain.  This was on Sunday, I had a follow up with my PCP on the Friday, however to being in so much pain and shortness of breath, and arm pain I was advise to go to the ER on the Thursday and was admitted again. I was told in the ER I had a blood clot in my right arm and it was most likely from the IV from the previous visit. My blood pressure and heart rate was so high that they put me on medication. No matter the pain medication they gave me, it would not completely take the pain away. They discharge me again on Monday and after me begging them to get run any and all test, they said they found nothing. I&#39;m still in the same amount of pain and same symptoms, still having trouble keeping my food down. The only thing that changed is my left arm is not as sore, however I still have a huge knot and its still warm to touch. I don&#39;t know what else to do that is why im contacting the CDC for help. I&#39;m in a extreme amount of pain and pounding headaches.  Please help

Approximately 7 hours after the injection (6:45pm), physical exhaustion set in; mental state was wide awake (thinking about everything/mind racing), however. Approximately 1 hour after the exhaustion began, slight fever and chills started.  By 9 pm the fever and chills increased to the point of teeth chattering and touch to the body felt raw.  Throughout the night, the fever and chills continued.  Sleep was mixed with pain in the legs and restlessness, coupled with a mild headache.  In the morning, the headache increased, but the chills subsided and the fever had broken (8am); slight nausea.  Eating food seemed to keep the nausea at bay; body exhaustion still existed.  headache subsided by the evening. no further chills/fever symptoms.  1.5 days for major adverse symptoms.  Soreness at injection is still continuing (no discoloration or lump, just soreness).  no vomiting, diarrhea, migraine  perhaps related, but not sure...my right leg had a broken fibula a month prior, but was ~98% healed.  The evening of the injection, that ankle was swollen to the size when the injury first occurred.  Earlier that day, the ankle had no visible signs of injury (no swelling, discoloration, etc).  In the morning, the ankle appeared as it had the day/week before.

She started practicing Yoga for 1 hour twice a week since 4/2/2021 until present,  and realized that the sensation and strength are different on both upper arms. The injection (Left) arm has more pain and less strength than the right side.

                                                THE PATIENT CAME TO THE PHARMACY TO BE VACCINATED FOR COVID-19, WITH JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON, ON FRIDAY, MAY 21, 2021 AT ROUGHLY 2PM.  I GAVE HER THE VACCINATION IN HER DELTOID MUSCLE ON HER LEFT ARM.  SHE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY COMPLAINED OF DISCOMFORT AND ASKED IF I HAD A COLD PACK.  I PROVIDED HER WITH ONE, WHICH SHE USED WHILE WAITING THE 15 MINUTE POST-VACCINATION OBSERVATION TIME.  SHE LEFT THE PHARMACY WITHOUT INCIDENT.  ONLY A COUPLE HOURS LATER, SHE CALLED THE PHARMACY TO REPORT ERYTHEMA AT AND AROUND THE INJECTION SITE.  I DID NOT KNOW AT THAT TIME WHETHER THE ERYTHEMA WAS DUE TO THE COLD PACK OR IF IT WAS A VACCINE-INDUCED RASH, SO I INSTRUCTED HER TO TAKE A DOSE OF ANTIHISTAMINE.  AS SHE HAD CETIRIZINE IN THE HOUSE, SHE TOOK THAT.  SHE WAS HOME WITH HER HUSBAND.  I RECOMMENDED HE KEEP AN EYE ON HER AND IF SHE DEVELOPED ANY ADDITIONAL SYMPTOMS OR WORSENING RASH, SHE SHOULD GO TO THE HOSPITAL FOR EVALUATION.  ADDITIONAL SYMPTOMS INCLUDED SWELLING, TROUBLE BREATHING, WHEEZING, CHEST OR THROAT TIGHTNESS, OR HIVES.  THOUGH SHE DID NOT EXPERIENCE ADDITIONAL SYMPTOMS, SHE DECIDED TO GO TO UCONN HEALTH CENTER ER IN FARMINGTON.  THEY DID BELIEVE THE RASH WAS VACCINE-INDUCED BUT DID NOT FEEL SHE REQUIRED ANY ADDITIONAL TREATMENT AND DISCHARGED HER (I.E., NO EPINEPHRINE).  THE PATIENT NOTED THAT HER BLOOD PRESSURE AT THE ER WAS HIGHER THAN &#34;HER NORMAL&#34; AT 152/95.  THE FOLLOWING TWO DAYS, THE RASH STAYED THE SAME AND WAS DESCRIBED BY THE PATIENT AS THE &#34;WORST SUNBURN SHE&#39;S EVER HAD&#34;.  SHE ALSO HAD NORMAL SIDE EFFECTS OF BODY ACHES AND CHILLS/SWEATS.  ON MONDAY, 5/24/21, SHE FOLLOWED UP WITH HER PCP.  HE AGREED WITH THE HOSPITAL THAT THE RASH WAS VACCINE-INDUCED AND TOLD HER THAT HE DIDN&#39;T WANT HER GETTING ANY COVID-19 VACCINES IN THE FUTURE.  HE DID BLOODWORK TO RULE OUT PLATELET ISSUES, WHICH, PER PATIENT, WERE NORMAL; SHE NOTED THAT HER RBC&#39;S AND HEMATOCRIT WERE SLIGHTLY ELEVATED.  HER PCP GAVE HER A MEDROL DOSEPAK FOR THE RASH. THE PATIENT IS RECOVERING.  I BELIEVE IT IS WORTH NOTING, HOWEVER, THAT THE PATIENT APPLIED THE COLD PACK DIRECTLY TO HER ARM FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME AND DID NOT PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO EITHER THE ER OR HER PCP.  SHE SENT ME A PHOTO OF HER ARM WHICH SHOWS GENERALIZED ERYTHEMA (THE SIZE OF THE COLD PACK) - THE ONLY PART THAT IS COMPLETELY NORMAL IS THE SKIN BELOW THE BAND-AID.  I BELIEVE THE PATIENT CREATED AN ICE BURN BY USING A COLD PACK TOO DIRECTLY, FOR TOO LONG, AND THAT THE UNDER BAND-AID AREA WAS NOT RED BECAUSE IT PROTECTED THE SKIN FROM COLD BURN.  I SUGGESTED TO THE PATIENT THAT SHE RUN THIS THEORY BY HER PCP, AS I BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT &#34;MISSING INFORMATION&#34;, THAT COULD POTENTIALLY CHANGE THE DIAGNOSIS AND ALTER HIS RECOMMENDATION TO AVOID FUTURE COVID VACCINATION.  WHETHER OR NOT THE PATIENT CONTACTED HIM AGAIN IS UNKNOWN.

Fatigue and achiness the following day.  4/17-4/19 tingly and soreness in neck and shoulders.  Virtual visit with doctor on 4/19 to discuss if symptoms were related to blood clots and/or vaccine.  Week of 4/25 extremely swollen and sore lymph nodes.  5/4 -5/6 fever (101).  COVID test 5/5 and negative result received 5/7.  Fever returned higher (102.9) on 5/8.  Virtual visit with doctor 5/10 to discuss fever and fatigue symptoms.  5/13 UTI test.  No infection but blood in urine.  Off and on fever and extreme fatigue continue along with loss of appetite and weight loss.  5/18 in person doctor visit to check symptoms, another UTI test and bloodwork.  Blood work came back normal, UTI normal, still blood in urine.  5/20 X-ray to check for pneumonia (none found) and ultrasound on kidneys and bladder to check for infection, kidneys stones (none found).  Also had more blood work done that day to check for mono (had as a teen with similar symptoms).  5/24 confirmed reactivated mono.  Symptoms have slowly improved since 5/23.  Another test is scheduled for the future to check the blood in urine again.

                                                About ten minutes after leaving the vaccination site, I began feeling a strange dizziness; an internal wobbly-Jello-like sensation. I felt a pin/needle/ stabbing sensation on my left fingers, particularly on the dorsal side of the third and fourth fingers, and in the middle of the tongue. The tongue felt as if was receiving a subtle electric charge that immobilized it with every shock. It lasted about 5 minutes. My vision was blurry. After that, my mind was foggy.  At about midnight, flu-like symptoms began sudden, but they were the expected symptoms for a covid vaccine (fever, body aches, sweats, sore throat, severe headache, pain on injection site, etc.) However, the pin/needle/ stabbing sensation was felt throughout the body. It sometimes felt as if a bubble, waves, or something was moving inside of me, in different areas of the body (rib cage, legs, chest, arms, legs, face, and top of the head (like when a baby moves inside of a pregnant woman, without the visible bump). My body, head, and neck felt stiff.  Symptoms were milder after 48 hours, on and off, until 4/13/2021 when I felt a sunken feeling, like something dropped inside of me (sugar, blood pressure, blood rush, I do not know). The tense feeling of the body returned. I felt dizzy. Left arm and leg felt tingly. There were palpitations, but I think that it was due to being scared about all the other symptoms. I felt cold and was shivering. The head felt stiff again. I was very thirsty. In the following days, symptoms got milder. On 4/22/2021, at about 4pm, the sunken feeling returned, along with the dizziness, wave or bubble-like sensation through head, face, body. The wave-like sensation flashed across my face, head, and neck intermittently. It was hard to speak, pronounce words, and swallow. The tongue felt numb. It lasted about two hours. I felt exhausted, so I took a nap until 8pm. When I woke up, I felt like nothing had happened, no symptoms until 1:00 am.  At 1:00 pm, 4/23/2021, the sunken feeling, dizziness, palpitations, heavy breathing without shortness of breath, cold/shiver, blurred vision, the wave-like sensation, and pokes suddenly returned. The waves were more intense and felt like pressure on the right side of the head and left side of the chest. Went to the Emergency Room. With every wave of sensations, was accompanied by an urgency to urinate. I urinated like 3 times in a span of 30 to 45 minutes (full bladder). Findings were normal but symptoms continued through 4/24/2021, on and off. Each episode lasts anywhere from 1 to 4 hours.  Short lasting, mild symptoms returned Monday 04/26/2021, at night, until Wednesday 04/27. However, that Wednesday night, I felt a belt like, tight sensation around the left bicep and neck. It felt as if I was being grabbed by the left arm.  On 4/29/2021, around 5:00 pm, I called an ambulance because all symptoms had returned ?full force?, such as sunken feeling, blurred vision, dizziness (like passing out), intense head and left chest pressure (in waves, like having a huge fish or parasite inside the chest and head), numb mouth (like dental anesthesia), hard to speak (hard time sending the message from brain to mouth). It took great effort to speak and felt that I had to decide whether continue speaking or staying conscious. I also had blurred vision with the first sunken feeling. Symptoms continued 2 to 3 times a day. Since 4/29 a feeling of being inside of an elevator, airplane, or earthquake, and the numbness on the left side of chest and arm remain, even when no other symptoms are present. Also, both arms become numb while sleeping, every night, multiple times a night, since 4/29. Since then, I sleep on 3 pillows (two in my head, one on the shoulders to create an angle) to minimize the numbness of the arms and the head/neck pressure while sleeping.   On 5/5/21, symptoms began while car riding as a passenger and upper body felt tight. Strangely, symptoms ended when car stopped moving. Later that day, while walking through a department store, nostrils felt uneven, as if the left nostil were breathing cold air while the right was taking warm air. That night, symptoms intensified (the attack). Like all other times, urinating was too frequent while ?the attack? is present. This time, my body felt sore and tired (Flu-like). There was an intense pressure on the right side of the eye and forehead. The neck stiffness was intense.  For the past two weeks, ?attacks? have been less frequent, about 2 to 3 times a week, lasting a maximum of 2 hours. The numbness on the left side of the chest and arm continues. The feeling of something moving or pins/needles may appear sporadically throughout the day. At times, they feel like twitches. The woozy feeling of being inside of an elevator remains. Breathing still feels heavy, like trying to breathe with the face in front of a fan.  All test results from the 2 ER visits were normal, including the CT scan. A brain MRI, done on 5/5, was also normal. A 24-hour heart monitor also had normal results.

I have a follow up appt with my endocrinologist Dr. on July 6th 2021 to see how Thyroid is doing. On 4/23/2021 I noticed that my feet were purple and they were stinging. I went to the doctor for this issue today and he said it could be from the vaccine or it could be another kind of circulation problem from sitting; or low iron. He says he wants to see me back in a month. No tests were ordered right now but he would do them in a month if it&#39;s still an issue. In April, it was just every once in a while that I noticed it and now it&#39;s every day. It starts in the afternoon and then by the time I wake up in the morning, it&#39;s better. Thyroid recovery is unknown. For the purple feet - No I have not recovered.

                                                11 days after the injection, I noticed a small patch of itchy red bumps on my side, above my hip on the left side of my body.  Over the course of the next 2 weeks, the itchy bumps developed into small vesicles which burst and began to scab over, eventually healing but leaving a small reddish purple discoloration on my skin.  I had a doctor diagnosed case of shingles approximately 24 years ago with nearly identical symptoms and sensations.  I personally believe that rash was  a recurrence of shingles.

These continued all night and got better the next morning when I took Ibuprofen. On Sunday morning, a little less than 48 hours after vaccine, I notice certain parts of  both arms were itchy. This morning, a little less than 72 hours after vaccine, I am experiencing an itchy rash in several places on my body including torso , knees and arms and legs.

                                                Started pretty immediately with feeling overheated like a wave of heat then started feeling unwell or not right then my right hand went numb that was about five minutes after the shot. Told the nurses they took me back in a room took my vitals at that time I started to feel weak like my arms and legs were Jell-O or jelly. I also felt jittery the nurses gave me apple juice and crackers they put me in a private room they check my vitals again my heart rate was elevated and my blood pressure also went up . 02 That?s normalsats normal My feet are they just started to feel numb as well. A doctor came in and checked me out they felt like my exam was normal but they also felt like I might be having a mild reaction around 1500 I started to get itchy but no hives noted I took a Benadryl 25 mg at 1500 around 1515 my feet were still numb but I definitely felt better still kind of felt like my arms and legs were weak but not as bad so after an hour and a half I was allowed to leave and was told to rest for the rest The day and you call or go to the emergency room if I had trouble some side-effects about four hours after the shot  my lips did start tingling at home I did check my oxygen saturations and it was normal I look at my lips to make sure that they weren?t swelling the only thing I noticed was that a scar I have on my lip that usually you can?t see was more prominent and you could actually see it my lower back hurts a lot

                                                About 7 hours after the vaccine injection I started to feel flu-like symptoms: aches, chills, woozy and slightly nauseous. Within the next few hours the symptoms became increasingly worse, but not different other than the addition of a headache. I took 2 Tylenol to help with the headache and fever. Overnight sleep was difficult due to chills, sweats, fever dreams and aches. The symptoms lessened the next day (24-hours post injection), but still included muscle/body aches, headache, and extreme fatigue. Again took 2 Tylenol to help. Today (48-hours post injection) I&#39;m feeling quite a bit better although still not 100%. Soreness at injection site persists, especially when lifting my arm.

                                                We had a vaccine reaction today at pharmacy 1870. Patient signed up vaccine online.   I saw on her form that she had a reaction to vaccine. , and discussed the vaccine reaction with her.  She said she had hives to influenza vaccine five years ago, but had influenza vaccines every year since including 2020 without incident.        I gave her the vaccine (Janssen) and almost immediately she said she felt tingling in her arm.  I had her sit in site of my gatekeeper for the vaccines.  In less than 5 minutes, she was swelling and red in the arm and it crossed over to her chest neck and the other arm.  She asked for a benadryl tablet and we complied, but the swelling continued to get worse. We immediately called 911 and the paramedics arrived in about 5 minutes. They gave her iv benadryl and transported her to hospital for observation.  Employee followed up with patient this afternoon.  She had been released from hospital and is doing well.  She was very pleased that we called to ask about her well-being.

                                                Day of vaccine, I felt like my lymph nodes were swollen. Two days later the injection site started to get deep red. Friday I started to about an inch of so, swell up some. Saturday I had a rash on my arm by the injection site, the top part on my bicep was pretty red and swollen. I didn&#39;t take my Humara or Zolar injection. On Sunday the rash got worse and grew in size and really hot to touch, the pain was radiating all the way to my wrist and hurt really bad causing pain when I moved my wrist. It was hard for me to go to sleep so I called the dr and went in . The dr. said it looked less red that what it was and told me to take Ibuprofen 800mg* 3x day.  The pain is now in both wrist and hard for to grip stuff and a little hot to touch.  You can see the difference in the skin tone where the rash was, it looks bruised.

                                                Patient received her vaccine at 11:30 AM.  Immediately after receiving the Jansen vaccine, the patient reported feeling lightheaded as she stood up.  She sat in our waiting area for about 10 minutes, and reported that she felt as though her tongue was swelling.  We contacted EMS at this point, and provided a dose of Benadryl to the patient at her request.  We brought the patient into our vaccine room where she began to break out into hives.  She vomited several times.  EMS arrived shortly thereafter and checked to see if the patient was experiencing an allergic reaction.  EMS took the patient to the hospital.  At about 2 PM, the patient called the pharmacy to let us know that she was okay.  She said that it was confirmed as an allergic reaction at the hospital.  She indicated that she had received a steroid injection at the hospital and was feeling much better.  We encouraged the patient to call us at any time if she had any further problems or questions.

                                                About 3 hours after the vaccine was given, I had chest pains and started running a fever. I had acute lower back pain and felt overall very lethargic. The fever continued  through the night and broke around 3am.  The next morning I felt okay but by 10am started to run a fever again for the remainder of the day and chest pains and headache/body aches were now VERY present.  It is now 5 days after the shot and I?m just starting to feel like myself again. The headaches and overall body aches lasted for days.  I also had blurry vision on and off during this time.  My husband and I workout every day and eat very well.  We?re not overweight and don?t smoke. The injection site is still sore 5 days later.   I will complete another form for my husband but he experienced the EXACT SAME reactions....every one of them.

                                                I had a very bad case of Covid in January 2021 and have not regained my taste or smell.  I was in bed for 2 weeks and had a prolonged fever up to 105 degrees--so high that I had visual and auditory hallucinations.  I had hair loss in the following months and I also continue to be fatigued.    I received the vaccination on 4/6/21 around 11am; a slight headache and face flushing occurred about 30 minutes after shot, but generally felt ok.  Woke up at 4am on 4/7/21 with chills, extreme joint pain, body aches, migraine headache, and a fever of 101.5 degrees.  Took Tylenol around 6am and went back to bed.  The migraine headache, chills, body aches, and extreme joint pain continued.  I was dizzy and extremely fatigued.  Woke up around 9 am and fever was at 102.7 degrees.  Joint pain and headache were almost unbearable at this point and I took a hydrocodone.  Took temperature around 12 pm and it was 103.5 degrees.  Fever continued rising to 104.4 degrees at 2:30 pm.  Took another Tylenol and went to sleep.  The next day, my fever had fallen back down to 102.5 degrees.  I continued with Tylenol to control me fever to around 101 degrees.   My fever persisted for 3 days.  I still have extreme fatigue, joint pain, burning scalp (which will likely mean more hair loss), zero appetite and weight loss, dizziness, blurred vision, etc.  The side effects are exactly how i felt when I got Covid in January.

                                                I had a sudden, large, spontaneous bruise on the index finger of my left hand with no precipitating incident or injury.  It filled the space between my first and second knuckle completely and extended into the finger tip and below the second knuckle. It is only in hindsight that I thought it could be a blood clot, although I am not sure. It resolved on its own with a few days, although I unfortunately don&#39;t know exactly when.

                                                I had a headache the next morning but no other symptoms initially.  Then, Saturday evening, just over 24 hours after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine I was sitting in landscape pavers outside in jeans and a long sleeve shirt next to the pool. My husband looked over and said what is wrong with your feet, they are blue. He said that is not good with circulation and you should probably talk to your doctor. Unfortunately I did not take a picture at the time and noted I was a little chilly but would reach out to my doctor if it continued and didn?t think anything more of it until I saw the reports Tuesday morning of them recommending to stop the J&amp;J vaccine.   I called my doctors office Tuesday morning and they asked me to come in over lunch to see the doctor. While sitting waiting to see the doctor my feel replicated the situation from Saturday  night. My toes were especially blue up through my ankle and the doctor pointed out I had red patches looking like a rash. She also noticed my right leg was worse and more swollen up to just below my knee. We did take pictures that we can share if prompted.

The tiredness and dizziness lasted about 7 days. The bad pounding headache lasted all day followed by mild headaches throughout the week.

The rash was on my trunk near where my bra is. It was a strawberry rash and I took some Benadryl it lasted three days. A few days later I started to get leg cramps like my legs were tired. On the right leg it went up into my thigh and my hip. It was cramping sensation that was constant and lasted for a week. It helped if I put my feet up it improved. Overall the leg cramps lasted for two weeks. I am recovered right now and the symptoms have not returned.

                                                I had - as soon as she gave me an injection - I felt like it was a little bit hot. I told her that. I knew I had a lot of allergies so I was being careful. Within a minute of sitting down, my right arm became swollen and bright red and felt burning and itchy. And it spread across my chest and went to my left arm. The rash or hives continued up my  neck up to my face and that all happened within first five minutes. Immediately after that, I had excessive coughing - couldn&#39;t cough up anything. I couldn&#39;t catch my breath and my throat started swelling a bit. they gave me 25 mg of Benadryl - capsule over the counter - and the 9-1-1 operator advised not to use the epi- pen. Paramedics came - gave me addition 50 mg of Benadryl - and they took me to the ER across the street and I was administered another 25 mg of Benadryl and also some steroid - Solumedrol - and after receiving these - then these symptoms went away. I continued on Benadryl and prednisone for a few weeks - the very next week - I had a large streak that went from injection site to left chest and I had a second red streak from left chest that ran down to my left arm. For two weeks, that burning fire rash would just come. No rhyme or reason as to when or why - arm, neck, chest, legs and sides. And I&#39;d have to take extra Benadryl every time it would happen and I was still on the high dose of steroids as well. I also had - the next day - 24 -48 hours after vaccine - I had a severe headache and it lasted all day long. And about 24 hours after the vaccine- extreme fatigue, body aches and headache and weakness and that lasted for about three days. Fatigue lasted three to four weeks. Joint aches lasted three to four aches. Headaches have still continued. They have almost been worse actually. I had two headaches that I was so concerned about that would not go away - worst headaches I have ever had: one on May 1 and one on May 9 - and I took Maxalt and some Benadryl - the Benadryl did help a little bit (enough for me to go to sleep). Each headache lasted 12 -15 hours and they were the most severe headaches I had ever had. I didn&#39;t have anyone to take me to take me to hospital so I just tried to sleep. I saw my primary care doctor - virtual visit. I took the prednisone for two to three weeks. I still contend with the headaches.

                                                Initially I had a red raised mark that was a bit itchy, sore, and hot. That faded after about a week, but it still felt like a bruise. Approximately one month later (I noticed on 5/7/2021) I realized that the same area that had been red/raised/sore/hot/itchy seemed to feel sunken in like an indentation. I measured the indentation area on 5/14/2021 and it was appx 3cm high and 5cm wide. It doesn&#39;t seem to be getting larger, but it feels deeper today, 5/18/2021. I can&#39;t find any instances of this issue and am starting to worry as it seems to be getting deeper and deeper. It does feel a little sore as well.

                                                It started as soon as I got the vaccine. I had a feeling of heat travelling down my arm followed by a pins and needles sensation. I stayed for 30 minutes and I could feel a strange feeling of pins and needles seemed to be travelling up my neck and into my face. When I saw that my arm was swollen. My arm started to itch and I was taken into the observation area and checked out. I went home and four hours later I felt like I couldn&#39;t take a deep breath and I started to get a headache, chills and fatigue. The next day my arm  and face were still little numb and I was still having a little trouble breathing. On day four I still felt like I couldn&#39;t take a deep breath and my heart rate was erratic. On the fifth day I went to an Urgent Care clinic. My blood pressure and heartrate were a little high. I went to the doctor the next day because they had found some hardening of my heart. After five weeks I still have a little feeling of pins and needles in my left arm and in the left side of my face.

Starting the next day with onset of rapid symptoms including severe headache, extreme  full body muscle aches and chills that felt painful as if had the flu, no fever,  then the extreme tiredness hit where i had to lay down and sleep.  I had to have my mom come get my young son because i couldn&#39;t even stay awake.  muscle twitching in my calf muscles and my right thumb pad, post nasal drip started then stuffiness and that smell you smell when you are sick. So i slept hard for about 5 hours and when i got up i felt 80% better. The headache had been so bad when i opened my eyes it was very painful. My arm still is very tender and sore and swollen, but these symptoms were weirdly short lived. The most scary was the sleepiness that i couldn&#39;t control.

It stayed that size for 4 days, and then finally started getting a little smaller each day. It&#39;s officially been 10 days and I would say that lymph node is about golf ball sized now. I did see my doctor and she said it can be a normal side effect and as long as it&#39;s going down not to worry.

                                                within 15 minutes, I had an immediate headache.  Over the next 72 hours, my headache worsened and a firefighter friend came to check my blood pressure.  It was 240/110 for the next 4 days.  I had not had blood pressure problems before.  I also developed a rash on my legs that appeared at hour 26 after the vaccine but resolved after 48 hours of the vaccine.   My heart was racing and extreme headache persisted.  My cardiologist saw me and put me on a heart monitor and had me record daily blood pressure numbers.  On day 18 after the vaccine all symptoms mysteriously resolved.  The doctor continued to monitor for 30 days total and then we decided if anything serious were to happen, it would have by then.  So monitoring discontinued.  I had not blood pressure problems before. Now its somewhat higher but within acceptable ranges (140/90 now)

                                                The injection site was really sore. Ran high fever and had flu like symptoms for about 15 hours. Then those symptoms stopped but the injection site pain continued. The intensity of the pain grew for about 3 weeks. Then pain extended to neck and shoulder blade. Went to urgent care  for the  arm/neck/shoulder pain. Took neck X-rays. Given a steroid shot and an another shot I think for inflammation. Prescribed a muscle relaxer.

In the morning I took ibuprofen which brought the fever down and took care of the headache. The fever did not return, but I took another dose of ibuprofen about 5 hours after the first for a returning headache. Today is the 6th and the pain in my arm (injection site) is still fairly intense and especially to the touch.

                                                Dizziness immediately following vaccine. Slight headache, moderate muscle aches, severe pain at injection site. It was also swollen with redness, itching, and it was hot. . Never had a fever. I immediately started taking Benadryl every 4 hours. I had really bad nausea (no vomiting)  to the point I was unable to eat and lost 7 lbs. I had really bad cold sweats so bad I was drenched with sweat multiple times a day for over a week. I ended up going to the walk in clinic about 5 days after the injection and was given Zofran for nausea.  I was also told I had a moderate allergic reaction to the vaccine and any other time they would start me on steroids but they said if I took steroids it would make the vaccine not work. So I was told to continue Benadryl and deal with it.  To this day which will be two weeks tomorrow since I received the shot I still have a hard hot lump in my arm, I still break out in cold sweats, and still have a little nausea.  Never had wheezing or issues breathing though.

                                                Started with the lower right leg and foot being itchy and red 7 days post vaccine. It then progressed to the right lower leg. After a few hours, the upper legs became red and itchy. It then affected my right arm, a little on my abdomen, and then the right elbow area. Benadryl, a cold shower, and icing the areas made the symptoms go away for several hours, but they returned over night at 3am.  Day 8, the symptoms were gone most of the day, but returned in the evening around 8pm. Benadryl taken and iced down the arms and legs.  Symptoms subsided.  They returned again at 3am and woke me from sleeping. It affected both feet, both legs, both arms, a little on my back and sides.

Parked the car. Car was in park but still running. Attendant at the clinic instructed me to move my car forward. I put the car in Drive and as I moved forward I lost consciousness. Completely blacked out. Unconscious in the car, the car carried on moving forward and crashed in parked car. I came to once someone tried to wake me up. Presently have no smell and have been very tired with the chills. I was sweating in my sleep, shivering and woke up in a wet bed from all my sweat. The next day I am just weak.

                                                Approximately 20-30 minutes after receiving the vaccine left arm became slightly numb, noticeable during the short 10 minute drive home. Within 30 minutes of getting home there was notable numbness in the left arm, especially below the elbow and into the hand with last two fingers being the most affected; numbness was also up into the neck and felt in the left cheek/jaw up to near the left ear and the scalp. This diminished over the course of the evening. The next two days there was lingering soreness in the left neck from where neck meets shoulder and slight tingling in the last two fingers. Ibuprofen 600 mg was taken to assist with any pain, usually in the morning with other medication before going to work. By two to three days after the vaccination there was no more soreness or numbness. While no bruising ever occurred, firm pressure on the site of injection two weeks later is still mildly painful.

AND TOLD HER TO TAKE 75 MG DIPHENHYDRAMINE.  THE REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT A.C.  WAS HAVING A MODERATE REACTION TO THE VACCINE (A.C. DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANAPHYLAXIS).  MOST OF THESE ADVERSE REACTIONS IMPROVED AFTER TAKING THE DIPHENHYDRAMINE.   TODAY, 2 DAYS POST-VACCINATION, A.C.  IS NO LONGER HAVING ANY SIDE EFFECTS AND IS RECOVERED.

Loss of appetite for 3-4 days.  Diarrhea on day 4.  Pain in arm at injection site for 4 days.

Treated with IV steroids and benedryl, no effect. Did bloodwork and showed hypocalcemia. They gave me an oral calcium supplement, tingling and numbness did not subside until next day. Intermittent tingling and numbness in legs continuing to present, 3 weeks post injection. Bloodwork by PCP on 3/30/21 showed normal calcium and protein levels but decreased GFR and low vitamin D despite regular supplementation of 6000 IU/day.

I broke out in hives  and whelps on the front of my neck and chest. It spread across my jaw as well by the end of the day. I was extremely hot and my skin felt like it was on fire. My head was extremely itchy. I took a Benadryl which did help the hives/whelps to clear a little after two doses bower I am still extremely itchy. I can?t stop itching. It?s everywhere to. Legs, arms, back head, shoulders...just everywhere, but no more hives. It is very frustrating.  This doesn?t appear to be reported as a side effect and I?m very concerned.

                                                The evening of Sunday, March 28 (4 days after J&amp;J vaccination) my skin began itching on my legs, feet and arms and was extremely itchy all through the night and into the next morning. On the morning of Monday, March 29, a red rash appeared on my legs and feet and arms. It would rise up in one area and then move to another area. I was itching uncontrollably and went to a clinic. I had never experienced any kind of skin condition or reaction like that before. The Nurse Practitioner guessed that it was some kind of allergic contact dermatitis, with the inciting irritant unknown, and gave me a prescription for Prednisone to take over two weeks. By the time I got home the rash and itching had moved to my back, chest and stomach. The itching and rash subsided after I took the first couple doses of Prednisone that day. I finished out the prescribed dosage over the following two weeks. I have not had any more rash or skin irritation since March 28-29.

                                                Within 4 hours I experience chills, fatigue and a headache.  Within 8 hours I had a fever and slept for the next 24 hours.  I broke out in buckets of night sweats.  The following 2 days I was generally fatigued and had sniffles.  After that I was fine, until Monday night (Day 10). I suddenly experienced a sudden onset of a painful and raised red rash at the base of my spine on my lower back. Within hours it migrated up to my head, face and then to the front of my torso. My eyes and throat closed. I took benadryl with no relief.  I called Dr. on Demand and they urged me if the symptoms got worse to head to urgent care/ER.  The next day (Tuesday 4.13) I went to the ER where they gave me a steroid shot, and prescribed me predisone and Prilosec to block the histimines.  I am still having rash symptoms,itchiness and burning.  While I have a history of seasonal allergies they&#39;ve always been stuffy nose at the most. We had no new dietary introductions or new habits.

Pt reported she awoke from sleep late 4/7/21 early 4/8/21 with severe pain in her left leg. She reported it hurt so bad she was &#34;screaming&#34;. She stated it felt like a &#34;charley horse&#34; and her husband noted a knot in her leg. She went to the ER on 4/8/21 due to the inability to put pressure on her leg and/or walk on her leg. She reports having a CT scan of her chest at the ER and no clots were noted. She stated they did not image her leg at that time and scheduled an ultrasound/doppler for around 4/27. She was prescribed some oral blood thinner, but could not recall the name. She stated she stopped the blood thinner on 4/12/21 after the new reports regarding the J &amp; J vaccine and not using blood thinners to treat. Today she states her leg is purple, black and blue and is swelling more when she is up on it at work. RN instructed pt to call her primary provider regarding stopping the blood thinner and to see if re-evaluation of her leg is needed. Pt also instructed to seek emergency treatment for increased swelling or pain to her leg, headache, abdominal pain, shortness of breath or any other concerns. Pt plans to speak with or see her primary provider today.

This began the day after the vaccine (4/9). By the afternoon of 4/12, it was feeling more intense. That&#39;s when I realized I had a skin irritation on my lower back and stomach. I went to my doctor and it was diagnosed as shingles.   My doctor said it was not caused by the vaccine but a stress reaction to the vaccine &#43; normal stress in my life.

                                                I immediately felt sharp pain and burning in my arm while being injected. The burning in my arm lasted for about 20 minutes. I got a severe migraine about an hour after the vaccine that lasted for about ten hours.  I broke out in hives all over my body later that night, the same day as the vaccine. I also had intense heartburn. I never get heartburn so this is not normal for me. The following day, I was still having hives and started also having chest pains. I was consistently taking antihistamines to keep the hives under control. On Saturday morning, 2 days after the vaccine, I was still breaking out in hives. My throat also started to swell and I was having a hard time breathing. My heartburn was also getting more severe. I ended up going to urgent care. There I was prescribed 2 stronger antihistamines and prednisone to help with my reaction. I was also given an epi pen.  Later that night, I ended up going to the ER as I was having severe chest pain. I have a history of DVT so I was concerned about blood clots. I had several tests done along with a chest CT scan. Thankfully everything came back clear for blood clots and heart attack. The ER doctor could not explain why I was having chest pain and advised me to monitor it and to come back in if it got worse. The following day, I was still needing antihistamines for hives and difficulty breathing. I woke up in the middle of the night with severe stomach pain and cramping. I had intense vomiting and diarrhea. The diarrhea started to have a lot of blood in it. I went back urgent care and they sent me for a CT scan which showed I now had colitis. The bleeding lasted for about 3 days.

Had I not taken the Allegra D that morning and Famotidine 1 hour before the shot, I would have gotten hives all over my torso and face and swelling would have started in my face.   I had an anaphylactic reaction but the histamine blocker and anti histamine kicked in after about 10-15minutes and I felt better.  Had I not taken the medicine I would have ended up in the Emergency Room.  That night I developed Oral Lichen Planus.  This became extremely bad and uncomfortable for the next 48 hours.  Then it started to heal.  It fully went away after 6-7 days.

On March 30 &amp; 31 I would have massive nausea.  On 4/2 after dinner I started to have chest pain.  This lasted into the night and I had cold sweats, nausea, vertigo and went to the ER.  CTScan w/contrast was done, chest Xray, EKG was adnormal.  Was admitted to the cardiac unit for observation.  Was there 24 hours.  On 4/4, I was still having the chest pain, went to another cardiologist where I had another EKG, Stress test, blood work. Everything looked good, couldn&#39;t figure out why I was having chest pain.  Echo was scheduled. The night of 4/6 the vertigo increased drastically where I couldn&#39;t close my eyes and go to sleep, went to the dr on 4/7 and that is when it was thought that it was tied to the vaccine.  Was put on meclazine for the vertigo as needed.  It was then that the anxiety and depression started.  By body broke out in Hives, was put on allergy medicine to help with those.  Unexplained bruising was occurring on my legs.  Was put on a Mediterranean diet which is supposed to help with inflammation. Stopped drinking caffeine and alcohol. The vertigo, anxiety and depression continues.  I had an MRI of my brain to see if there was anything showing. Bloodwork was done. Started to experience breast pain, went to my dr, had a mammogram and ultrasound to see if anything was there.  Lymph nodes are still swollen, have to go back in 6 weeks. Went to an ENT for the vertigo and he found some of the crystals in my ears, I&#39;ve never had that before. On 4/29 I had a hair appt where 1 minute after she put the hair dye on my hair, I experienced more vertigo.  Still experience the depression and anxiety, hoping that subsides very soon.

The itchiness and redness stayed for the rest of the day and night. The following morning I noticed the rash spreading to my chest. I went to doctor where I was given Zyrtec. This calmed the itchiness and the redness. I didn&#39;t feel any itchiness by the following morning. The rash went away as well, but the roughness of my skin is still partially there. I didn&#39;t have any other symptoms, or any reaction around the injection site.

Patient voiced that she took Benadryl immediately and the reaction began to subside. The patient also stated that he woke up Saturday evening with a large sized knot on her arm where the vaccine was administered. Patient stated that it has since gone down in size but is still fairly large.

Left Arm immediately felt odd---sore, heavy, tingly all the way down to my wrist.  By noon, I was asleep.  Slept for about 3 hours.  Up for 3 hours.  Slept for 3.  Up for 3.  Then slept all night.   I had a headache and slept most of the next day.  Definitely felt like my body was fighting something.     I have an approximately 3 inch diameter circle around injection site that is a red, swollen, hard, lump,  It is hot to the touch and extremely sore---at times it itches.  I am shocked how big and hard the knot is.  Its crazy!  I cannot put weight on that arm.  Extremely sore.  It is now 4 days after the vaccine and the knot does not seem to be getting smaller.  In fact, it may be bigger.

                                                I started getting fatigued around 7:00 pm that evening. It was hard to finish walking my dog. I was getting the chills to the point that my teeth were chattering.  I couldn&#39;t wear a shirt at this point because it felt like sandpaper on my back, but I did not have a rash.  I went to bed earlier than normal and woke up around 11:30 with the worst headache of my life.  My head was throbbing and pulsating and any little movement made it worse. The bottom of my head hurt, where my head connects to my neck.  My lower back hurt.  I woke up every 1 1/2 hours in pain, due to terrible headache.  After suffering for several hours, I finally took some Aleve at 7:00 a.m. the morning following the vaccine.

It was flat, round, pinkish in color and grew  about 2&#39; in diameter and was warm to the touch. By Sunday and today it was not as sore, but was still the same size and bruised.

                                                As soon as the shot was administered in the deltoid muscle within 3 seconds my axillary node was on fire and I couldn&#39;t put my arm at rest.  Extremely painful in my armpit.  The injection nurse said that is not normal and gave me a sheet to report to the CDC scan code.  My entire left arm was on fire within a minute.  She had me sit for 30 minutes.  I had no other reaction.  My arm was subsiding a little bit to toleration.  I went home and rested, drank a ton of water.  I went to bed and woke up at 2 am in a cold sweat, I felt like I was freezing and could not stop shaking.  My teeth chattered.  My husband put on many blankets and helped me get warm.  He said I was burning up.  My muscles were so weak and painful, joints hurt and extreme head ache.  I took some Advil and he warmed me up.  My left arm was numb up my left side of my neck and my left cheek.  I took the day off work.  In addition, in the morning I felt like my left leg and foot had minor numbness and prickles.  I could walk but it was colder and prickled on the foot each step.  The next day I was 50% better and made it to work barely.  It took me 3 days to recover from the flu like symptoms.   My left arm continued to feel numb and had bouts of prickles and tingling.  The muscles were hard to use in my left arm and I really didn&#39;t use it at all.  Over the course of 2 weeks things have improved.  I still have not recovered feeling in my left pinky and ring finger.  They are weaker still today.  Every morning my left arm is numb for a little while (I don&#39;t sleep on my left side) but recovers to about 75% except my pinky and ring finger.  My left neck and cheek have a warming prickle feeling every morning for about a half hour.  They mostly wake up to entirety.  My L foot at the bottom has period/episodic prickles.   Daily my left arm is colder and is weaker than before.  I am a high school teacher so I don&#39;t have to use my left arm very much but it is causing pain and negative sensations and is reducing the amount of use of my left arm.

I was also experiencing a constant fluctuation of hot flashes / cold chills for several hours. This persisted into the morning, until approximately 8 am. &gt; After lots of hydration, rest, and heachache medicine (Acetaminophen), I felt better; this was around approximately 11:45 am/12:00 pm.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA:  Immediately after the vaccination my arm was sore and shortly after my right hand was stiff.  About 8 hours after receiving the vaccination I began to have extreme chills and a fever that was near 102 F.  I had a fever and chills all night and woke up with a migraine.  After sleeping most the day from extreme tiredness I woke up to my head feeling very weird and I was acting very sleepy and irritable according to those around me.  After 24 hours, most  reactions have gone away except for soreness at the injection site and a pain in my right leg.

At first it was intense all over body itching that felt like it was from the inside out. By the time i got home i was getting red blotchy patches over my face, neck, and chest. I took benedryl which did nothing to subside the reaction. When my chest started feeling tight i went to the emergency room. My lips were itching and puffy. At the er  i received treatment for annaphylaxis once and about a half hour to forty minutes before i was to be discharge i had a reoccurance of symptoms and was treated for it a second time and admitted to the hospital. This was from the March 31st clinic held at the fire department.

                                                On 3/23, I received the vaccine. Within a few hours, my right elbow began to hurt and swell. On 3/24, I could not move my arm due to inflammation and intense pain. The skin was hot to touch. I also had a high fever and severe headache. (The fever broke within 24 hours and the headache lingered for about 48 hours.) On 3/25, the arm swelling started to decrease but was still intensely painful, red, and hot. I treated the arm with ice packs, Advil, and Bio-freeze. On 3/25, I also contacted my PCP by email with my concerns and progression photos of my arm. Another doc responded by having his nurse call me. They denied the reaction could be vaccine related. The nurse insisted on their diagnosis and that I should take antibiotics for a skin infection. I disagree because my symptoms did not match their explanation. On 3/31, I contacted my rheumatologist (due to the inflammation) and they referred me back to my PCP. I am filing this report b/c I believe this was related to the vaccine. Lesser symptoms remain.

I called the neighbor for help. I couldn&#39;t communicate, my body was shaking, trembling, I stuttered as I was trying to form words. I was taken to hospital by ambulance. I was unable to speak, I was shaking and my blood pressure went up and down. I was given IV fluids and Ativan for anxiety, dysarthria and altered mental state.

The pain has not decreased over these several days and radiates down to my thumb. Monday the site became raised and has a hard bump under the skin.  Tuesday the raised hard bump has a slight peak similar to a mosquito bite and is becoming itchy. Today/Wednesday there has been no decrease in symptoms.

                                                Around 06:00 pm, which was about 9 hours after having received the J&amp;J vaccine, I began having a slight fever and chills.  The most pain I had was in the back of my legs.  Both of my calves felt as if they had both been kicked and were badly bruised.  It was painful to walk for about 48 hours/2 days (Sunday - Monday).  That was the first time in my life that I had that kind of pain in my back calves.  Never had before from running or walking.  Then around 09:00 pm on Tuesday, a reddish dot appeared on the left side of my cheek.  I thought it was just a big zit.  But the following day, the dot got bigger, and looked like a scratch.  On Wednesday, it was definitely a scratch-like shape (2 lines, less than an inch long) and had begun to feel itchy.  That was when I had realized that it had the same pus-like dotted features of a cold sore.  But oddly, it&#39;s not right next to either side of my lips.  Instead, it is further down, towards the left side of my chin.  It is very rare for me to get cold sores.  I can&#39;t remember when my last one was, as it was years ago.  So I am wondering if this cold sore is due to having received the vaccine.  The fever, chills, and leg pain have not returned after those first 2 days.

                                                My arm was immediately sore and was sore for a week.  Within a few hours from the vaccine being administered I was tired, hands and feet very cold, chills, headache and a fever.   This lasted for 3 days.  I was and am still fatigued and it has been 2 weeks since my vaccine.  On Friday, April 9, 2021  (8 days after vaccine) I woke up with a sore throat and a swollen gland in my neck on the right side (side of my injection).  The sore throat and my swollen gland is starting to subside on Day 14.  Throughout these whole 14 days I have had hot and cold &#34;flashes&#34; and while I already have anxiety my anxiety has been much worse (feeling of a pounding heart) since the vaccine.  It is not my normal anxiety.  On Day 11, Tuesday April 13, 2021 I woke up with a black spot on the right side of my chin closer to my bottom lip.  It does not hurt, not raised and it is just a black spot.  It is still there on Day 14 and slowly starting to fade but not by much.

                                                About 4 days after the vaccination, I developed a rash, first a large patch on my lower back, followed by other areas, including another large one on my upper left arm (the injection site) and many other smaller ones on my fingers, abdomen, leg, and arms. The rash was initially made up of small clusters of intensely itchy bumps, which would eventually redden and join together. The worst areas also swelled a bit and the skin started to feel dry and began peeling in places.  The rash drove me crazy all day and woke me at night. I treated myself at home with o/c antihistamines, anti-itch creams (hydrocortisone, etc.), and ice packs for a week and a half; but the rash did not subside and was continuing to pop up in new places. I had my appt with the doctor on 04/7/21. Due to my allergy to medrol, I was not prescribed oral steroids. I was prescribed doxepin for pm (sleep and itching), o/c Allegra for am, and a steroid cream. The treatment has been effective and the affected skin is healing.

                                                Patient states that she received her Johnson and Johnson vaccine on 4/7. That night she started feeling fatigued, developed a headache, had some body aches and chills that lasted through the following day, then symptoms resolved.  One week later on 4/14 she developed severe bilateral joint pain, specifically in bilateral shoulders, elbows, and knees- to the point where she could barely walk. She was also very fatigued and had chills. This lasted through the following day and started to subside, but then noticed small, papular lesions scattered across chest and arms. The lesions are itchy, small- 1-2 mm, and follow no particular pattern.  She states that today her symptoms have overall improved other than the small itchy bumps. Denies any headache, abdominal pain, joint pain, fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, or redness/swelling of extremities.

On Sunday morning 04-11-2021, I had horribleheadaches and I took a Tylenol but it did not help. On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday I again woke up with headaches and I felt extremely fatigued. I went to see my PCP who performed blood tests and also did a D-dimme test which the tests came back as being okay. I also experienced a full body rash and was having slight breathing issues. I also went to see an allergist on Monday 04-12-2021 due to my whole body rash, patchy skin, red and white bumps on my forehead. I was also concerned because at the inside of my mouth and upper pallet I had red bumps which lasted three days. I took me a whole week to recover from these symptoms.

                                                Approximately  2 hours after the vaccination I felt very minor side effects (headache / soreness on injection site). The next morning I felt the more intense side effects (fever of 101.1, chills, fever,  extreme sweat, loss of appetite, body aches and fatigue).  While the majority of the side effects have passed I still have no appetite.  I am a very healthy adult that does strength training  4x a week, I typically eat and snack every 3 hours.  Since the vaccination day I have no desire to eat and I am down to 2 meals (breakfast and dinner). I am also experiencing headaches and dizziness but this could be from the lack of nutrients.  Because I feel dizzy I am forcing myself to eat as I almost fainted during a morning workout and had shortness of breath. This particular morning I had coffee, a protein shake and a banana prior to my workout.  I have not read or seen any additional information on the loss of appetite lasting this long and I am getting concerned

Controllable with Advil during the day and most gone by 24 hours after the shot. Rash: By that morning, had a rash that worsened over the next day or two and lasted over a week. Was primarily on my neck, upper chest and right arm. Patches of small red bumps that were quite itchy. Took Benadryl that 2nd night, which provided some relief but not entirely. Tried Allegra 12-hour the following day, with limited relief. On Tuesday 4 days after the appointment, I went to see the doctor and she prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide Ointment, 0.5%, which offered the best relief. Rash improved though persisted over a week.

                                                Day of the shot: Muscle aches, fatigue and chills. The next day, I was feeling better. Day 3, I had migraine headache. Day four I was better. Day five, I broke out in a full body rash - Saturday evening. It started on  the right arm and it spread all over my body. It lasted off and on for thirty-six hours. It migrated over my body. I went to the ER, and they said I was having a reaction to the vaccine. She prescribed me steroids, I didn&#39;t take them because I was hoping the rash would get better without them. I went to my Dr. the next day - by the time I did see my doctor the rash was getting better so she said I didn&#39;t have to take the steroids. I was taking Benadryl from the time the rash started and continued until it was gone. The rash ended on day 7. Once the rash went away, I had fatigue for four days.

Heavy clots of menstrual discharge were observed. It is not yet known whether these side effects will continue for my next menstrual cycle. Lesser effects followed two days after the vaccine with fatigue, sore arm, armpit, and glands in the injection arm. These side effects dissipated by day 3 status post vaccine administration.

                                                The day I received the Janssen vaccine, I had pain at the injection site immediately, which was to be expected. My arm was very sore for over a week. I felt ill at dinnertime but was able to eat. Around 10:30 PM I started to feel like my skin was on fire. It was hot to the touch as well. However, I was freezing and couldn&#39;t get warm. My teeth were chattering. I started crying uncontrollably. I have never had tears run so hard down my face. The tears felt like they were burning my skin because my skin felt so hot. I awoke my husband to help me. He wanted to take me to the Emergency Room, but I wanted to wait. My muscles ached terribly. I had to pace back and forth because of the intense pain. My head also felt like it was going to blow off of my body. It wasn&#39;t like a normal headache. It felt like I had swelling in my brain. The left side of my head was sore for days afterwards. I then became terribly nauseated. I didn&#39;t throw up but felt like I was going to. I also felt extremely dehydrated. I was able to drink some water. It was a very long night. Looking back, I probably should have gone to the ER. My husband worked from home the next day so he could be available if needed. It took a long time for me to fully recover. I woke up exhausted and struggled with fatigue for a while and had extreme exhaustion in the evenings. My ears would turn bright red in the evenings and feel hot to the touch. I still have some fatigue now but am mostly better.

                                                A week after the vaccination I developed a mild case of shingles -- deep pain along upper back/between shoulder blades, along right shoulder, along right rib. It eventually ran up right side of neck. A few days later blister-like welts appeared along right shoulder/upper back and later right side neck. A lot of pain and burning along right shoulder and neck followed and continued for 3 weeks. Chills and headache also followed for 3-4 weeks. Slowly the blisters opened and crusted over.

I started choking on my own spit. My hands got really big. I couldn&#39;t talk. The pharmacist told my friend to take me to the ER. I could kind of spit out stuff. She took me to Urgent Care. They gave me an epi-pen and instantly my tongue got small.  Through an IV they gave me: Prednisone, Benadryl and fluids  - by the time the IV was done I felt 90% okay. Four about 4 or 5 days - I would get fat fingers and itching. I would still have trouble swallowing - kind of choked when I swallowed. About 5 days after the event the allergy part was gone. I had three days of an oral steroid I was suppose to take and two weeks of Zyrtec. I did have flu-like symptoms also on the night of the vaccine. I had COVID in December 2020.

I was admitted into the hospital for diverticulitis in which I have never had an episode prior.  After 2 scans I still have the infection and have been on antibiotics for 3 weeks now.  I also have significant joint pain on my right side which is the side the shot was administered on.  My right knee and ankle are inflamed and in severe pain.

                                                So within ten minutes of receiving the vaccine, my chest area was completely covered in hives. It started off small and then covered my chest, I walked over to the nurses and they called the EMTs. They checked me and my throat to make sure it wasn&#39;t closing up. Within twenty minutes it started to go down (the redness). In an hour I had some tingling all over my body. I spoke with my PCD the day after the vaccine and then physically saw her. Now we are much after the vaccine and I see a neurologist suggested by my PCD, because I have random numbness in my fingertips and body and I also experience a lot of fatigue, very tired regularly. I also had a delayed menstrual cycle for about a week. I also felt cramping on my fingertips and toes.

The vial was accidentally not discarded at store closure and was placed back into the refrigerator. The next day Friday, May 28th the patient was administered a vaccine from the expired vial. The manufacturer was called for a recommendation. They stated administering the vaccination at the time period it was given was not studied and for the pharmacist to use their best clinical judgment. After consulting other pharmacists it was determined to not re-administer the dose, but to contact the patient and monitor for infection. The patient was contacted to be made aware of the event that had occurred and reported feeling &#34;achey&#34; with a slightly red injection site but no fever (05/30/21). The patient was advised to call back with the onset of any side effects, and has not called us to date.

I could barely walk and I felt stiffness and pain in my legs. I went right to bed and I was sweating. My skin was burning all over and I had headaches. I felt better after 24 hours but I was still a little tired. I started to get a rash which was on my right arm and my left and right chest. I went to clinic. The rash was raised red bumps that were very itchy. It covered my whole right arm. The rash got better after I started to use the Triamcinolone cream. I was given.  I still have the rash on my arm and my chest after two weeks but it has improved.

                                                Vaccine was administered high and towards the back of the upper left arm.  Retired, older lady was giving the shot, she didn&#39;t squeeze the arm muscle or check the arm for correct placement.  Longer needle than was needed was used.  Arm was relaxed during the entire duration of injection.  As soon as the injection went in, deep pain was felt down to the wrist and mentioned to those administering the vaccine.  They instructed me to move my arm as I left the area.  I experienced immediate pain in the shoulder, never had arm muscle pain.  Shoulder pain became excruciating over the next 2 weeks.  Went to orthopedic walk-in clinic, they took x-rays and diagnosed me with impingement syndrome based off of my symptoms of pain and decreased range of motion.  I started physical therapy April 26, 2021 and continue to present.  Physical therapy has helped to increase range of motion and build some strength in the shoulder, but specific areas of pain (front and top/outside of shoulder area) continue to disrupt daily activities and interrupt sleep at night.

Patient had already discussed with doctor and he still recommended getting the COVID vaccine. Benadryl 50mg  STAT was administered and patient waited another 15  minutes. She was feeling well other than the itching. Recommended that famotidine could also be administered to help with itching, and hydrocortisone cream if a particular spot was more bothersome than others.

I wasn&#39;t that concerned at the time because they do that sometimes during my menstrual cycle.  I did find it odd and was frustrated because my entire body, and then varicose veins just ached and I couldn&#39;t do my morning runs.  The veins in my hands burned and throbbed when I took a leisurely walk around the neighborhood with my husband.  I told him at the time it felt like even my skin hurt.

                                                Immediately 10 minutes after receiving the vaccination, I started sweating really bad, I got a metal taste in my mouth. The next morning, I woke up with a huge migraine, couldn&#39;t concentrate, pain in my arm, and my whole body was just very hot. Over the next few months, I had developed swelling from my toes to my mid-calf, which went into my thigh the next week. It got to where I could no longer fit into my jeans. My whole body turned red. I went to the urgent care, which they immediately sent me to the ER. They did an ultrasound all over my body to test out blood clots, they took blood work. They ruled out having a heart attack and blood clots. They sent me home. A Few weeks later, I was at work and the pants I was wearing were cutting into my abdomen. I went to my PCP; I was so swollen head to toe. He put me on a steroid. PCP did blood work and everything is still going on and they still can&#39;t figure out why and having more symptoms on top of swelling. I have been on many different kinds of steroids. Had hallucinations, my PCP told me to go to the ER again. My breasts got super enlarged, the doctor I got at the ER still didn&#39;t figure anything out. They did a CT, Blood work, EKG, more ultrasounds. They then sent me to another ER, they did another CT, my brain was smaller than normal, my eyes were in the wrong place. To this day I am still experiencing all of these symptoms.

Also a terrible migraine-type headache on the left side with an unusual (for me) ocular disturbance. The rash seemed to appear first on my left arm, and the rash was worse on my left side (left arm worse than right, left side of face more covered than right). I cannot say exactly when on Saturday I noticed it. The bumps on my face itched terribly. I took Benedryl at night, by Tuesday morning it began to fade. The migraine appeared at approximately 2 PM on Saturday, July 10. I took my usual migraine medication, Sumatriptan. The headache presented with a sudden blurring and sense of pressure in the left eye. This headache and change in vision also persisted until Tuesday morning, July 13.

                                                Got vaccine at 5:36 pm and during waiting time afterward, she reported around 5;53 pm having generalized tingling then followed by generalized pruritis. Denied and did not exhibit signs of urticaria, angioedema, cough, dyspnea, wheezing, CP, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, lightheadedness, weakness, pallor, tachycardia. Discussed giving her diphenhydramine and she agreed stating she had no previous adverse reaction to this treatment. At 5:56 pm, I gave diphenhydramine HCL 50 mg/ml 1 ml IM in her right deltoid muscle. Around the time of the injection (approximately 5:59 pm, pulse was 76, oxygen saturation 97%, BP 138/90, lungs clear, heart RRR. Within 20 minutes (6:22 pm) of diphenhydramine injection, she reported that the tingling had largely subsided (only remaining in lower legs) and her pruritis was improving. Her pulse was 77, oxygen saturation 96%, and BP 126/82 at that time. She also reported she had not developed any new symptoms (see above). By 6:28 pm, she reported no further tingling nor pruritis and feeling well. We released her at that time as we deemed her recovered from the symptoms. We advised her to call 9-1-1 if the symptoms returned especially with one or more of the above symptoms she had twice denied experiencing. 3/9/21 11:47 a.m. Called to check on status. No answer. Left message.

                                                My injection was on a Monday at 1pm. I had no issues for about a day and a half. On Wednesday afternoon I started having itching and redness on my forearms and top of both hands. Both arms on Wednesday evening were swollen, quite red and sore (a bit of a burning sensation). It almost feels like a bad sunburn at times. I took an antihistamine to help with the itching and swelling and this morning actually put calamine lotion on my arms to help soothe the burning feeling. It is more irritating that painful and nothing needing medical attention but I thought it should be reported.

                                                A bumpy itchy rash started first in my arms and after in wrists and hands so i took 2mg of betamethasone and after 45 minutes another tablet of 1 mg. After 2,5 hours the rash calmed down on the upper part but it started on legs, tighs and foot. I was on fire and to have a bit of relief i put a wet cloth on the skin and i took another tablet of 1 mg of betamethasone and 1 of benadryl allergy. Around 11 pm the rash stopped and the skin became normal. I slept with no problem, but the next morning after 20 minutes I woke up the rash started again in all the body so I took 2 mg of betamethasone and 1 benadryl allergy. I went to the vaccination center but there wasn&#39;t any doctor, only a nurse that told me to keep on taking antisthamine and corticosteroids.  It calmed down around 12 am and started again in the late afternoon.I took a benadryl, i used the wet cloth and around 10 pm stopped. Night with no problem, but around 9.30am the rash started again so i took 1 mg of betamethasone and 1 benadryl. Around 1 pm calmed down and at 2pm i took 2 benadryl. Around 8 pm i had some itchy spot on the legs but it didnt turn out in rash. Today after 30 minutes i woke up i had some spots on the legs, i took a benadryl and after 1 hour disappeared.

I went to facility on Saturday at night because I was worst and the doctor told me to don&#39;t worry because It is normal when you got a shot but she never looked to my arm. she went into the room only to give me the diagnostic but without look to my arm. The diagnostic were: adverse reaction to vaccine. I already have the syntoms and tomorrow it will be 1 week since I got the vaccine. I don&#39;t know it is normal. If you want I have pictures.

One time each day Tue, Wed, Thur then Friday morning I woke up with my whole forearm on the arm I got the vaccine covered in hives.  After an hour the other arm started having hives then on my stomach.  After Benadryl it stopped. Sun morning at 5:00 am I woke up with hives covering from my elbow to my shoulder on the vaccinated arm. I took Benadryl immediately and it did not spread

                                                I got the vaccine on Tuesday. That night, I had some slight aches and was warm, but nothing awful. The next day, I was just a bit warm. I exercised on Thursday morning because I felt better (stand up paddling). Then the rest of the day, I was very tired and then Friday and Saturday and Sunday, I was very dizzy, foggy, fatigued, no mental clarity, difficult to hold a conversation and answer questions, no focus. Today, Monday, I still feel like I have a brain fog and am talking very slowly. No focus. Conversations feel tiring.

                                                I had burning with the actual injection.  It burned as it went in and went down a small ways into my left arm.  The rest of the day I had the normal symptoms- Pounding headache, nausea, horrible body aches (couldn?t lay down or stand to be comfortable).  That night around 11:45pm I got up to let my dog in and I started seeing small black dots- blurry vision.  I felt nauseas.  I ended up falling on the floor.  I was able to get up.  I then ended up waking up in the bathroom on the floor and had no idea how I had gotten there.  My hands were vibrating.  I called my husband from work to come help me up.  I was able to sleep and didn?t seek medical attention.  I am not sure if it was low blood pressure or what could have happened I have never experienced that before.  I did contact my doctor?s office this afternoon via (online) but haven?t had a response yet.  I have been in bed all day today.  - Body aches, nausea, pounding headache

I wasn?t able to wake my husband and remained as calm as possible. I drifted in and out of sleep. By 4am I was able to wake my husband. He used our elevating bed to sit me up and gave me ibuprofen and water through a straw (not sure why that was his solution and just thankful I?m here today to type this response). By 6am I had terrible shooting pains in my hands, fingers and then Charlie horses in my feet and calves. That is when the ability to move came back. At that point I was extremely fatigued and exhausted and felt like I had a terrible flu. I was in bed for the next 6 hours clammy and  sweaty and in a very achy.  24 hours after the vaccine I was back on my feet.  50 some hours after the vaccine I still have an aching in my hip on my left side and tenderness at the injection site.

If I move my arm a certain way, I will get a tingling shock in the area (feels like hitting funny bone). Muscles up and down arm burn after non-strenuous activity.

Visited personal allergy physician 4/9/21. per MD Allergist/Immunologist DXd = systemic immunological vasculitis. Most probably a delayed hyper immune response to my vaccine. Legs, arms and sides covered in innumerable petechial eruptions beginning 6 days post vaccination and 3 days post vaccination side effects (chills, headache nausea) subsided. Eruptions spread consistently for 36 hours and are constant not intermittent. They are hot, painful to the touch, and do not blanch. I?m on 60mgs of prednisone for 5 days (the highest dose given outside a hospital) and then 40 for 5 days and then 20 for 4 days. If I get any mouth nose or eye or interior genital irritation I have to go to the hospital and be admitted for higher dose steroids and constant monitoring. Dr advised  this  will take weeks to resolve and the eruptions will likely fade slowly and possibly peel.

Took Pepcid 20 mg and symptoms subsided after 10-15 minutes.  A few hours later began to vomit, which subsided quickly. The nest day had body aches which only lasted 1 day.

My left hip is hurting really bad, my left arm sometimes hurts. My back is also now hurting. Nothing I take alleviates the pain, I have tried Aleve, Tylenol and Ibuprofen. I am extremely fatigued both day and night now. My bones feel very painful even sometimes down to my feet. While most of my body hurts, the left side seems to hurt more than my right side. When I got the vaccine I felt very &#34;out of body&#34; if that makes any sense, but now I feel very off. I also seem to be bruising easier than I used to before as well.

                                                I received the vaccine at approx 930 am, Wed, March 17 (Johnson and Johnson Lot 1805020) at the Facility by Fireman(Emergency Responders). Vaccine was from Health Care. At first, after about 15 minutes I was feeling a little flush, there were light red splotches on my skin (only a couple, very light red - like when i get really nervous and get red splotches on my neck.) I felt a little nauseous and dizzy off an on for about an hour (but i had not had anything to eat or drink yet that day either). The site of the shot was a little sore and warm about an inch or two away from the needle injection site, but not a big deal. That night my right arm (which is where i received the shot) ached terribly, all the way from my shoulder to my fingers. The next day (Thursday, March 18) was the same. Sometimes my left arm tingled like it was starting to fall asleep. This went on the whole next day. Injection site still sore too, and warm.  The day after that (Friday, March 19) the injection site was sore (like a sore muscle) and that was it. Saturday, March 20, the same until about midnight. Around midnight my son, and I came upstairs from watching tv and my arm (at my wrist) was aching intensly! I looked down and there was a small lump where one if the veins are. I can see my veins easily here and I am very light-skinned. Son could also see the lump. My arm kept aching so badly! I was messaging the lump over and over. After about 5-10 minutes it went down a little bit, ached a little less, and i left it alone. The next day it looked like i had a bruise on my wrist and hand (where the meaty part of your hand is  going to the thumb. The next day, Sunday, March 20th, a neighbor said it could be a blood clot and i took an aspirin.    Today, Wednesday, April 14, 2021.   Approx 1130am, after getting out of bed, getting some coffee. I was sitting at my desk in my home office, took my medication and took my first sip of coffee. All of a sudden, my chest starting hurting. I cant say where the pain originated, it was in the chest/upper stomach area. It ached a lot, I felt very flush, I honestly cant remember if it were hard to breath, all i could think is &#34;what is this?&#34;. I didn&#39;t know if i would throw up, burp, pass out. the aches starting migrating, still saying in the chest, but expanding to my lower back. I got out of my chair and tried to move around...it took a good 3-5 minutes before it started to dissipate and I took another aspirin.

                                                The first side effect I noticed was hives on the arm of the injection site as well as the arm being painful. I became light headed and very tired after the first hour of getting the vaccine. As the evening progressed I begin to get chills and a fever. My body ached from head to toe. I was nauseous and achy all over.  I was feeling sick for the next 24 hours, I stayed in bed and could barley move because my body ached so bad. I had a extreme head ache as well.  By the 3rd day I felt much better and only had pain in the arm of the injection site. After day 10 I noticed a lump near my collar bone and assumed based on web searching that it may be a swollen lymph node.  It&#39;s day 12 and I still have a little tenderness near the injection site and my lymph node is still swollen.

                                                Severe R shoulder/arm pain since injection.  Upon receiveing the injection I experienced severe pain in my R shoulder joint, but the nurse told me that was normal.  Over the following hours/days/weeks the pain began to radiate up my neck, down my arm and into my scapula and lat areas.  My range of motion (ROM) had become severely limited and I began to experience neuropathies in my right arm and hand.  I tried all OTC pain relievers which had absolutely no effect.  On April 6th, I was in so much pain that I went to an urgent care clinic.  They provided me with prednisone, soma and celebrex (upon completion of steroid).  In addition, I started myself on gabapentin which was provided in the past.  I have one more day of celebrex remaining.   While my symptoms are not nearly as bad as they were, they have not resolved.  I continue to have pain in/around my R shoulder, neuropathy in my R arm and limited ROM/weakness cross-body and above 90 degrees.

                                                I had a deep purple bruise the size of a quarter on my right arm a few days after taking the Janssen vaccine. I did not injure myself or bump into my right arm so I was baffled about how I got the bruise. I also experienced weird sensations in the muscle of my left calf on two occasions a few days within my vaccine. They felt like muscle contractions  and the muscles quivered and I thought I was getting a charlie horse, but they were not painful or unbearable.  The quivering lasted about 10-30 seconds. I&#39;ve never had any sensation like this in my calf before. All of this coincided with me hearing news about the blood clots and deaths associated with the J&amp;J vaccine shortly after I took the jab. Initially, I brushed it off and talked myself out of any connection between the vaccine and my symptoms. I was talking with family &amp; friends recently and they suggested I report my symptoms so that&#39;s I why I&#39;m reporting now 11 days after my vaccine.

                                                Not too many adverse symptoms the day of and after vaccine... tired at times and sensitivity to light but continued to eat and helped w energy.   Also, warm left side of neck and slight red rash.  Not expecting to have leg pain in my calf 6 days later then moved to quad muscle and entire left leg felt achy.  CDC at this point said to check out any leg pain.  Pain was not severe but bothersome... had STAT ultra sound at ER on day 7, turned out negative for blood clots.  Returned to my physicians office day 8... still not feeling right with more of a rash on left side of neck and warm to the touch. Tired and slightly light headed and slight pain in left upper chest.  Digestion not the best starting day 5 thru 10.  Blood test returned normal for platelet levels but low eosinophils... either allergies or body is fighting the vaccine and creating antibodies (most likely).  No known allergies besides maybe skin reaction to Timothy Bluegrass.  Moderate headache day 9 and 10 which made me more fatigued (pain on both sides of head above ears and temples)... normally I do not get headaches.  Also, loss of appetite or feeling slight nauseous on day 8, 9, and 10 after the vaccine.   Now on day 11 and 12.. feeling better but still not quite right.  Lightheaded and feeling fullness in head but more energy than day 9 and 10 by far.  Never heard of people having symptoms after day 1 or 2 of the vaccine, so obviously I think this should be more documented for patients especially after blood clotting as a possibility 6 days after the vaccine.

                                                No flu symptoms but experienced a lot of pain in the arm injection was given.  It has been two weeks since the injection and I have a hard lump under the injection site and it is still tender to the touch.  My parents received the injection the same day and neither of them have this issue.  I have not seen anyone about this yet as I don&#39;t know if this is serious or not, I just keep waiting for it to go away.

I stayed in bed  and drank OJ, multi vitamins. On 04-10-2021, started to feel bit better, chills went away, still had muscle body aches, cramping in my hands and by Sunday I noticed an aching sensation from my left shoulder to my left elbow, itchiness and also started to experience an aching, itchiness sensation on my back down the back of my leg and calf. I then made an appt with my provider to get evaluated. I had lab work done to check my platelets and a follow up was given to me that all was normal. After a few days, my symptoms got better, I have no symptoms today only a headache and muscle cramping to my shoulder areas these last couple of days.

I put ice, massaged it and tried to break it up. I talked to my doctor who recommended me to apply light pressure massage. These symptoms lasted for 1-2 days.  My left arm is still sore but doing better.  I feel anxious due to the side effects the J&amp;J vaccine is having.   I do not have the lot # with me at the moment.

                                                Developed tinnitus in my right ear that has not gone away. Onset of that condition happened around April 26-27. I do not normally have this condition. Also, received allergy shots in each arm since my vaccination, and both have resulted in large welt and subsequent bruising which has not occurred in the past year of having the same injections.

Over the next week I got a red spot around the site of the shot which got bigger. It was sore itchy and tender. It grew to the size of two inches in a circle around the site of the shot .I also had a headache for a week that was constant for the whole day.  I went to the ER and they just told me to take Tylenol for the pain. My arm was still effected, for two weeks total and it itched toward the last few days. My headache also got better.

                                                Received shot around 3:15pm. A few minutes later the area around the injection site got really hot and painful, and then I started getting really hot from the abdomen up to my chest neck and face. I called out for the nurse who came in to check on me and I almost fainted. I stayed at the facility for almost an hour until I was able to leave. I was not anxious or faint feeling before the shot so anxiety did not cause this. Once at home I was really tired. Today, July 13, I have had a fever, muscle aches, chills, headache, stomach issues, and a random numbness and tingling in my lower left leg that I?ve never had before.

                                                Arm was just sore for a couple days after the shot at site of injection. It got better after a couple of days.  On Tuesday, July 13 at approx 9:30 pm the arm started hurting just below the injection site and felt warm in that one spot.  I had on a tank top and it was cool in the bedroom.  It is now Thursday afternoon and it is still sore and warm to touch in that spot and the arm is a slightly weak and sore feeling all over.  Not too bad.  It is not getting worse, just not any better.  I just went to the doctor and she is sending me to have an ultrasound just to be on the safe side to rule out a blood clot.

                                                Around four hours later began with a head, heart beat really fast, small fever, extreme nausea and IBS-like symptoms (gas pains and diarrhea), fatigue. The later lasted for nearly a week, but the rest were gone by day 3. I did not see a dr as my fever never got very high and only occurred the first night. The nausea last maybe a day and a half. I am about two weeks out and I seem to be having a gluten skin reaction (dermatitis herpetiformis) and given most of the symptoms I listed could also be celiac symptoms, I was curious if there was gluten in the shot as it was very much like an extreme reaction to gluten that I normally get with celiac. I usually see gluten rashes a couple of weeks to a month after being exposed and I was not exposed to anything during the last few weeks that could be causing it (that I know of). The nurse who gave me the shot did not know if there was gluten in the shot. Hence, I know the first symptoms were definitely related to the shot, but not if the current rash is from the shot (because gluten, this is definitely DH and not an allergy rash). I hope this helps, if other celiacs have also had a hard time.

Woke up around 7 am feeling better. Mild heat flashes until about noon. Felt fine the rest of the day. On Thursday 3/25 around 6pm I started developing hives, itching and red rashes on bilateral lower legs. Thighs, knees, feet and ankles. I waited several hours to see if it would go away and it did not. By 10:30 pm it was much worse. I took a 25mg Benadryl tab. Rash went away. On Friday 3/26 rash and hives, itching and red rashes returned. Both kneecaps very red and hot. It mainly stayed on lower legs until about 5 pm. The rash then started on bilateral arms. I took another Benadryl at 6pm. It is currently 7pm.

                                                I have a history of Guillain barre and typically after infections or vaccines I get a relapse of symptoms. About 2.5 hours after my injection I noticed numbness starting at the tip of my toes on my left foot. By 5 hours after same on my right. At 24 hours it was up to the base of the toes. Now 2 days after I have numbness to the balls of my feet. I also have numbness around the injection site. Although this is fairly normal for me. Typically lasts about 3-7 days of progression with 1-2 weeks to resolve. So far the pace is spot on for my history. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Fingertips still feel like electricity is running through them and fingers/hands still hurt; extremely hungry/thirsty from 03/25/2021 - 03/29/2021; fatigue, pain at base of skull under ears, tinnitus extremely loud and both ears feel like ear ache; During the night of my high fever, lower back where kidneys are started hurting very badly.  What is still left of that pain on day 5 is a pain radiating from my lower back down my right leg many times throughout the day (treating with ibuphrophen).   Pain around knees, elbows, ankles, and bottom of feet- different than joint pain.  All my POTS symptoms are in high gear (tachycardias, very low BP,  pain, dizzy, vertigo).    If the leg/lower back pain, and left arm problems continue, I will see my neurologist or immunologist.  I have reached out to both to make them aware.  My husband had the JJ shot same day, same place and had zero side affects.

Took two 500mg Tylenol. By 10am, has no fever. Just tired and a little weak. Rested throughout the day and felt better. No more fever since. Feel a little odd numbness  on my tongue, but no lost  of taste. Still have the odd numbness on the tongue. All other symptoms are gone (still a little sore in the left arm, but not a big deal).

                                                Starting on morning of Day after vaccine, experienced very SEVERE fatigue, headache, and nausea. Also low grade fever with sweats and mild sore throat.  Arm was mildly sore at injection site for several days.  Headache and fatigue continued for three full days. On 5th and 6th day after vaccine, had diarrhea.  Was told by doctor at vaccine event not to take any anti-inflammatories for 3 to 5 days.  He said Tylenol was ok.  Took Tylenol day after vaccine when adverse effects were the worst and it did not help at all.  Finally took Advil on day 4 and it relieved headache.  Now 7 days after vaccine still have intermittent headache.

The flu-like symptoms included muscle aches, nausea, stomach pain including more significant pain in the upper left stomach area, headache and fatigue with difficulty sleeping.  I needed to take time off from work due to these side effects and had difficulty performing daily activities.  Also experienced pain at injection site that got worse in the first 12 hours and lasted also approximately 36 hours.  Minor nausea, stomach pain and injection site pain have continued after 36 hours with ability to return to daily living activities.

Rph applied constant pressure using cotton balls to the area for 5-7 minutes. Bleeding had stopped and a new bandaid was applied. Injection site adverse event was then resolved. Pt expected this due to her having a medical condition of anemia and taking subsequent B-12 injections. Pt was observed for 30 minutes and no bleeding re-occurred or was seen. Pt was directed to put ice and pressure on it for further home care.

NO FEVER but major body aches and soreness. AFter the chills wore off I was in a sweat..this pattern of chills, vs soaking sweats continued throughout the night. Add to that dry heaves due to nausea but no vomiting. The dry heaves just added to the muscle pains that I already had. I was in bed until 5 pm the next day, no energy, sore body aches to the point that my skin hurt. still no soreness in my arm at all. I finally had the strength to get out of bed at 5pm took a shower and ate 2 pieces of toast to combat the nausea. Fast forward next day, felt fine and arm was mildly sore at injection sight. SO glad J and J is only one dose.. I would have dreaded a second day like that.

Dizziness lasted for a few minutes which created nausea. Sat at site for approximately 25 minutes after shot. Left arm was sore between shoulder and elbow, which was to be expected. Later in the evening, experienced fatigue. When trying to go to bed around 11pm,  my left are was throbbing. I did take Tylenol at about 6pm. Throughout the AM hours, sever body aches started, extreme fatigue throughout the following day. Flu like symptoms continued the next day.  I had heard of these symptoms for the other shots but not for Johnson and Johnson. Hungry but too weak to actually cook.

                                                I received the shot in my left arm and experienced the expected symptoms of a sore arm and tenderness at the injection site the day of the shot and the day after.  Yet on the third day when symptoms were supposed to be getting better, I developed severe pain in my upper left  shoulder and across the back of my neck into the middle of my back.   My collar bone area on both sides was also sore.  I did nothing physically to explain this additional pain.  It was so uncomfortable that I spent most of day  3 and 4 after the shot laying around while taking Tylenol around the clock.   The worst of the pain was gone by day 5     but I continued to have discomfort in my left shoulder for almost another full week so much that if I wore a bra, I would have to take it off half way through  the day because it caused so much discomfort with the strap on my shoulder.  Everything feels ok now  that it has been 3 weeks since my vaccine but the muscle pain and discomfort was very painful and unpleasant way past the listed side effects of the vaccine.

                                                Injection was administered very high on shoulder next to what feels like a bone. As injection was being administered I felt pain on inside upper arm down to wrist. Pain subsided. Day progressed. I used my arm to grocery shop. About 6:30 -7:00pm I noticed stiffness and inability to lift arm with extreme pain in attempts to lift arm. During the night had restless sleep. Had to use other hand to move arm into resting positions. No comfortable position.  Saw general practitioner on 4/12/2021. Received a paper with physical therapy exercises. Today, 4/13/2021, Still extreme pain to stretch arm to side and in front. If raising arm overhead with help in range of motion exercises (abduction) cannot lower arm without severe excruciating pain in inner shoulder area. New symptom includes numbness in wrist and forearm.

I had no soreness around the vaccine site. I used steroid cream and took 50mg of Benadryl. Two days later it was gone.

Patient presents with concerns related to possible reaction to the J&amp;J COVID vaccine she received last week. She developed some face tingling/numbness, then felt like her throat was closing - not sure if due to lymph nodes swelling or possible reaction. She thought about going to ED or using epipen, but ultimately did not need to do either. She has been on zyrtec for her allergies which have been really bad too, so was not sure if that could be contributing. Later that evening she developed headache, chills, joint/muscle pains and fatigue which continued through the night and into the next day. She also had burning of her skin, specifically her hands and feet. She continues to have some fatigue, joint/muscle pains and mild headache. She is worried about recent development of potential clotting with J&amp;J vaccine - she has factor V Leiden and is supposed to travel later this week. Headache not described as severe, no SOB, leg pain or swelling or abdominal pain reported. Tachycardia  &#34;

                                                I am a runner and run regularly. On 3/23 I was running with friends early in the morning and got a strange cramp in my left calf. I?ve never had that happen before. It was so strong that I had to stop running and walk the last mile home. The strange cramp/pain lasted about 4 days.  Then last week my family and I were skiing and I got a sharp pain in the shin of my left calf.  Nothing brought it on, it was intense and just started out of nowhere. The pain lasted about 10 minutes and then subsided. It was very strange. That night I had a large bruise. The next morning the bruise was the size of the palm of my hand. The bruise was gone after about 4 days. I don?t know if these are related but I?ve never experienced things like these in the past without something causing them.  So after hearing reports of adverse reactions these seemed worthwhile to report.  As a side note, I also did get sick during the 24 hours after my shot. My symptoms included intense body aches, headache, sinus pain, sore throat, fatigue, nausea and a fever of 102.4. These symptoms all subsided after 48 hours of my vaccination.

                                                I woke-up on 4/7 with an itchy throat and hives were starting to form on my stomach.  As the day went on, the hives were all over my torso and went up to my neck as well.  When I have hives on my neck, they usually start to bother my asthma/breathing, and this happened on 4/7 as well.  My allergist said to up the dosage of Allegra 24 hours from 2 tablets a day to 4.  I also took my Albuterol inhaler to control the wheezing.  My doctor also gave me a prescription for Prednisone in case I needed it over the weekend, and recommended I go to the ER if my symptoms got worse.  Luckily, the extra Allegra and asthma inhaler calmed by symptoms down.   Things calmed down over the weekend and by 4/14, the hives were completely gone and I was not longer experiencing any side effects.  I did not need to do any in-person doctor&#39;s visits; I just talked to my doctor on the phone.  Please note that I also had the &#39;flu-like&#39; symptoms after the shot as well.  I felt great after the shot and even exercised on my elliptical around 7:45 that night.  At around 9:00, I had extreme chills, where my body was shaking, as well as sweating.  I also had extreme fatigue, a headache, and some body aches as well.  I slept for 16 hours that night and felt somewhat better when I got up.  By that late that night, all the flu-like symptoms were gone.   I took some Tylenol for the headache.

                                                Within a half hour of injection, I experienced pain in my left leg (thigh muscle mostly). Throughout the day the pain spread to my left hip and left calf. Additionally, I felt like my muscles were ?on fire? on the left side of my body. I also felt a ?tingling? in my body, fingers and toes, leg muscles, primarily on left side. (I assumed at that time that this was ?normal?.) About 11 hours after injection, I experienced extreme muscle pain all over my body, lasting for about 12 hours. (Flu-like muscle pain and the feeling that all of my muscles were on fire.) The following day, I began to feel the feeling of pins and needles everywhere but primarily on left leg, thigh and calf.  By Thursday evening (three days following injection), I felt the most severe pins and needles feeling as well as ?itching? primarily in calves and hands and feet. I was so uncomfortable and panicked, I couldn?t sleep. On Friday evening, I felt intense leg pain and ?heat? on left side in both calf and thigh muscle and couldn?t sleep. On Saturday evening and all day Sunday I had a headache which I can?t say was related but caused me great concern. Now, eight days later, most of the pins and needles feeling has subsided but the pain in my left leg (thigh muscle) is at an all time high. Extra strength Tylenol is not helping. I did have a consult with my doctor last Thursday and I called again yesterday and I?m waiting for a call back. (Last Thursday, she agreed that my symptoms were unusual and thought I might need to see a neurologist.) Additionally - my left knee has bothered me and feels like someone hit it with a bat. I?m not sure if this is joint pain?  FYI - I have no apparent swelling in legs, no numbness, no trouble breathing and no significant headache today. I never had a fever or chills. The injection site burned for a few days (mild)  but was never red.

                                                6 days after I got the vaccine, I noticed a large rash across my torso.  I am unsure if the rash was developing prior to when I noticed, but the rash is on my stomach and part of my lower back.  I finally visited my primary doctor today and was told the rash is a drug reaction - it is not itchy nor painful.  **I am supposed to be on baby aspirin indefinitely due to my heart condition.  I have not taken baby aspirin in a few years.  But after there were reports of women getting blood clots after getting the JNJ vaccine, I started taking baby aspirin 6 days after I got the vaccine.  The rash may have happened before or after I took my first dose of baby aspirin.  I stopped taking baby aspirin the following day.   Today, my doctor advised me to stop taking all Vits and Supplements.  I will be taking Zyrtec and Tagamet for next 10 days, hoping the rash will go away.

                                                3/28/2021 12:45pm Shot received  as part of 1200  had gotten access to. It felt like fire in my arm at the point of the shot and moving down toward my wrist. It was cold and rainy, and I had taken my arm out of my sweater and the sleeve had gotten a little damp. I put my arm back in the sleeve and the cool damp sleeve made my arm feel better while I was observed and then drove home.  3/28 3pm I got home and the arm the shot had been given in was sore ? the aches seemed to move across my shoulders and all over my body.   3/28 10pm ? 7:30 am, Over the course of the evening, the aches seemed to get worse and I developed a headache, so, I took 2 tylenol and went to sleep.overnight I had severe chills.   3/29 7:30 am I took 2 Alkseltzer Cold &amp; Sinus (tylenol and decongestant) and laid back down. Around 9am I had a glass of juice ? I was extremely thirsty and this helped.  3/29 11:30am The headache and body aches continued, but the chills seemed to break with a trade to cold sweat. I took 2 more Alkseltzer Cold &amp; Sinus (tylenol and decongestant) and got up.  3/29 3:30pm The headache and aches continue, I took 2 aleeve to manage the headache and body aches.  3/29 6:30pm the body aches and headache are better but not gone. Cold sweats starting again 7:30 ? 2 more tylenol. 3/29 11:30 2 tylenol for bed ? slept through the night no problem.   3/30 ? 8am: Woke up still achy, but the headache is significantly reduced, started feeling a little dizzy and periodic cold sweat 3/30 ? 6:30 pm still a little dizzy and marginally achy  3/31 ? 8am: mostly back to normal. The spot on my arm is still raised and tender, but in general, I feel like I did before the vaccine, suffering seasonal allergies sinus congestion and headaches. My eyes are very tired, I?m having a hard time pulling things into focus or looking at screens ? the headache on Monday was a migraine complete with severe light sensitivity. Wearing readers with blue light blocking helps my eyes feel better.   4/1 ? arm still sore at location of shot, going to continue using scar cream on bump where shot was given. Eyes still a little weak/tired.  4/3 ? arm finally quit hurting ? still sore, but not actively in pain at site of injection.

                                                The day after the vaccine I woke up feeling achy and lethargic. The following day I got a rash at the injection site. Three days after getting the vaccine I went to Urgent care because I had a rash and my joints were swollen. I had target shaped rashes and blisters all over my body. It was extremely itchy. It was not on my face and upper chest but they seemed to be focused around my joints. My joints were a little achy. I also had pins and needles in my hands and feet. I was given Prednisone  for seven days and discharged from the urgent. The rash lasted about seven days. Some of the spots were still scabs at that point. The swelling in my joints and the tingling feeling were resolved in two days after taking the Steroids. I have Eczema and Hashimoto?s disease and pre-existing nerve issues. I was told it was an autoimmune response. I have had problems with my allergies since I got the vaccine which has not happened since childhood. I am also having episodes of food triggered Eczema. It took about three weeks before I was fully recovered but the food triggered Eczema which I have not had problems with for 15 years.  It does seem to have settled down a little.

After that day everyday I woke and it grew, inflamed, it was firm lump to about inch and half near injection site, and grew overnight larger it was red, swollen and painful. Called my dr on 05/02/2021 and did not hear back from him at all. The lump ended up being the size of my hand, I placed iced on it, and it has went down. Each day since, I have iced it and it  has gone down each day. During this time, my period it was very heavy flow for  8 days, then it stopped then began again 9 days later and lasted 7 days heavy flow again.

                                                I discovered patient on the floor at approx. 3:03pm. She was lying face down on the floor next to the chair she was sitting on during her 15-minute observation post-covid19 vaccine. Unknown person turned patient over face-up, Face was clammy and warm/hot to the touch. Pulse was taken (weak). Sweating. Eyes were closed when EpiPen was injected on left thigh through pants. It was decided to inject patient as we did not know what exactly happened, why she was on the floor, and she was unconscious at the time we initially thought to give epi injection. 1 pen injected. Pharmacist called emergency services at 3:05pm. Patient eventually regained consciousness while waiting for the paramedics. She was able to talk and answer questions. She was taken outside the gym on stretcher, but her son met us at the school to pick her up. She declined going to the hospital for further treatment.

It felt like my bones were made out of glass and someone had taken a hammer to my bones.  My face was swollen and red.  Unable to sit up.  Walk from bed to toilet only.  Overall, I would say extreme flu-like symptoms.  Temperature 99.6 all day.   I could not take the pain any further at 4:20 pm and took 1,000 mg of Tylenol.  I finally fell asleep and woke up at 8:30pm and could walk again and my fever had broken.  I still don&#39;t feel great, but I think the worst is behind me.

                                                On the evening of March 16, 2021, I developed an itchy rash (and possible hives) from my elbows down to the tips of my fingers on both arms and from my knees down to my feet on both legs. On March 15, I had taken a long walk outside, so the rash seems to have followed exposure to sunlight, which is the same allergic reaction I have had to sulfa drugs in the past. So this made me think that potentially my itchy rash/hives could be an allergic reaction to the vaccine, but I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;m just reporting it out of an abundance of caution. I am taking Benadryl and using an anti-itch lotion and cold compresses. The rash/hives are still present more than 24 hours later, but even though the itchiness is bothersome, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a severe problem. I am hoping it will go away soon. I plan to let my primary care person know via email, but I don&#39;t currently plan to see her about this unless it doesn&#39;t go away after a few days  or gets worse.

The staff noticed I was in some distress and kept asking if I was okay to which I replied I thought I&#39;d be fine once I got some fresh air.  Left the facility to drive home and didn&#39;t feel right, Within 30 minutes, developed chest pains, rash and labored breathing.  I recognize the symptoms as the same symptoms I get when I&#39;ve had morphine, which I now must list as an allergy.  This lasted 4 hours, then got better.  The next day around 1:00, I became ill again with flu-like symptoms and had to leave work.  Headache and body aches mostly.  I was ill with these symptoms for a 24 hour period.  Hopefully all symptoms have passed, except my arm which is red, swollen, itchy and feverish.

My husband was monitoring me, laid down and elevated my legs above my head, took Benadryl, hydrated, and rested. When I could stand, I took a pure hot shower to warm up. I thought I was going to die.

Aches in my muscles and joints as if I had Rocky mountain spotted fever again. That is what the side effects reminded me of. This went on for over 48 hours. I have never been so sick. Very nauseous by next day. Also fell to the floor from nearly passing out the following morning. Took a minute for the light headed To pass. Arm pain still today. It was very scary and seemed to be a very serious reaction. Friday after noon finally started feeling better. The other strange part of this is that my daughter and best friend and I received the shot together in the same lot number and every one of us was deathly ill with the same symptoms. I am the only one with the fainting spells. Still feel fatigued today. And shoulders and left arm injection site still sore and achy.

Fourth day, no pain unless you push on site. Also experienced achy legs the day after getting the vaccine for a day.  3 days after getting the vaccine, I started to get mild headache mid-day.

I was achy all day off and on.  Sunday 4/11 I felt okay all day until around 10 p.m. At this time I noticed my throat was sore and swollen. I started coughing and feeling achy again. If I laid down I started to wheeze. I was very tired. Monday 4/12 I slept all day until 2:00 p.m. When I got up I felt achy and my throat was sore. I had a dry cough. I could not taste or smell. 4:15 p.m. went to my Doctor and was tested for Strep and Covid 19. I tested positive for Covid 19.

                                                by 10-11 p.m. that night severe chills. did not sleep the entire night due to extreme headache, chills, fever (102&#43;), body aches.  felt truly awful.     by 6 am Saturday feeling nauseated and wound up vomiting. Saturday night/Sunday -- not 100%, no appetite, intermittent nausea, but able to work/do normal activities. Monday 4/5--nausea at an 8-9 in the morning and kept a trash can next to me during virtual hearings I had that day.   Intermittent nausea throughout the week and not much appetite but made sure I was eating/drinking despite that.   Wednesday night 4/7 -- I went to use a PT stick on my left leg b/c I had felt a little pain in my left knee and figured my quadriceps were fibrotic.  I could barely put any pressure on my left thigh. I had never experienced anything like this.  As soon as I started rolling the stick on my leg, my skin was immediately red and warm and my leg was so sore and tender I had to stop.   Saturday 4/10 -- woke up with severe headache and later that morning felt very weird in my head/heart, like heart racing and my head felt &#34;spinny.&#34;  Felt like I might pass out at one point so I had one of my kids sit on my bed with me until I felt a little better. Sunday 4/11 -- had another episode like Saturday (headache and lightheaded/spinny/pass out feeling/slow speech) and asked neighbor (an RN) to take my BP.  her at-home device said 147 over something and she suggested I go to urgent care just to double check.   About three hours later, I was seen at  urgent care.  BP was normal, heart rate normal, oxygen was 96.  4/13--followed up with primary doctor.  Send me for blood work to check platelets, etc.  Feeling pretty good today but nervous after the news and the pause.

Next day, fatigue and muscle and joint soreness. It continued for almost three weeks. The third week I got calf pain that was very painful. I went to Urgent Care. It lasted until the next day (so for two days total). When I woke up on the 6th it was gone like it wasn&#39;t even there. The third day after the vaccine, the injection site started hurting - but not swollen or anything. The muscle at the injection site still hurts - the pain comes and goes.  I did get an iron transfusion (march 8th) before the vaccine - I had a doctor&#39;s pass to take the vaccine.

                                                About 4 days after I started having abdomen pain, it was like having contractions, then bleeding and spotting, and it was a different type of color instead of a period color, more burgundy. it lasted 26 days, when I&#39;d eat it would start again, I started having headaches, and had vision problems, then SOB started and I used the inhaler to help. I also had a low grade fever of 99.8 - 100 that lasted up until about 5 days ago. I started having bruising and leg pain, the bruising would be if someone helped me get up, I have little bruising dots over my body.  I went to the ER 3/16/2021 because the stomach and headache pains, they did a MRI and Ct and said it was acute stomach pain and migraines and told me to see a OBGYN for the bleeding and gave me meds for stomach pains. Bentel for stomach and Floraset for headaches but it never worked. I had a nerve block on my head for the migraines but it didn&#39;t work.  The GYN gave me something to stop the bleeding and she&#39;s wants to do a D&amp;C. I&#39;m waiting to see my PCP on the 19th.  I still have the purple dots and headaches, I still get the contractions and the stomach issues have settled some.

                                                Headache and general tiredness began 30-45 min after shot.  Muscle soreness (injection site, rib muscles, leg muscles, back muscles and neck muscles) began soon after.  By 6pm, muscles had become painful.  I had chills but no measurable fever.  I got in the bed but unable to sleep due to muscle pain and discomfort.  Hip joints and back began to ache.  Fever and chills worsened over the next several hours to measurable with highest at 102F.  I took 1000mg tylenol generic which did not lower fever but fever did not rise higher.  Throughout the night, I experienced calf muscle cramps and foot cramps, stomach pains, joint pains, inability to sleep, worsening injection site soreness and armpit soreness (likely lymph node soreness).  Once in middle of night I may have felt chest tightness but I even doubted that I really experienced it as I had been thinking about all the AEs I was experiencing.  Symptoms continued through night.  Next morning, developed a cough so I made appointment to get a COVID exposure test at 1pm on 13th April because I had flown in plane on 10th April.   Cough could have been due to allergy type post-nasal drip because of high pollen in area.  By late Tue evening, I felt better.  Headache had resolved and muscle symptoms improved.  Now (3:45pm on 15th April) I am still experiencing lymph node/armpit soreness and general inability to focus, think clearly.  I feel like I am in a fog.  I emailed a message to my physician and reported this through VAERS

No appetite at all.  I&#39;m coughing now - lingering. Felt burning when the injection was going in at the time of vaccine and I told her that it needed to be taken out right away. The administrator said the burning was the vaccine going in. It was on my left side, it&#39;s like when you get contrast in your body and it&#39;s warm-like sensation. It felt like on the inside of my left side of body - it was warm; pain. It felt funny - like it was burning. I noticed that my ankle (left) was getting red and then it was getting a little dark and getting darker. When I got home (about an hour or so later) - part of my foot to my lower part of my leg looked like it was burnt. Like a very ugly bruise and like a burn. That is still here. I have put aloe vera and cocoa butter on it but it&#39;s not going away.  I have photos I can upload. Have called my doctor because these symptoms haven&#39;t gone away - I talked to telehealth nurse and she said was normal. But then I called and made an appt with Primary care doctor and that appt is May 27th - upcoming.

                                                The shot was given very high on my shoulder and was extremely painful. My range of motion was limited, but I thought it was normal because all people report pain, but then a few days later my whole shoulder really started to hurt very badly so that it was even waking me up if I rolled over on it at night. It was very, very sore. I thought I might have injured myself somehow, but recently I was told that some people have this strange shoulder reaction that can come later, so I figured I should report it. It&#39;s been two months now and the intense pain is gone, but I still do not have full range of motion in my left arm. It still hurts if I try to raise my arm straight up. I don&#39;t know if it pierced my bursa or what happened. The pain is deep around the joint of the shoulder.

                                                Developed deep lowerchest/upper abdomen pain on right side 4 days after vaccine was administered.  Pain got progressively worse and a rash developed on right thorax in the Thoracic rib 5 region; Visited Army doctor on 12 MAY.  Based on visual exam of multiple, tiny water-filled blisters only on right side of thorax &#43; description of pressing pain in chest similar to feeling of a heart attack, both doctors on shift diagnosed shingles.  Forgot I received COVID vaccine 4 days before symptoms started so I never mentioned it to the doctor.  TRX= 800mg acyclovir 5x/day x 7 days.  Rash continued to get worse and spread more before finally subsiding and starting to crust over.  Nearly 3 weeks later, rash is now a combo of scabs and open wounds.  Pressing deep pain in right chest is persistent and only relieved partially with 800mg ibuprofen q 8 hours.

I was told to take Benedryl by my doctor. It took three days to clear. It returned a week later. I followed the previous request and took more Benedryl. It cleared and returned again last week. I called the CDC and they informed me that the hives may come and go.

                                                After about 15 minutes I started to feel my scalp itching and tingling. The itching started to spread. Took Benadryl. Itching continued to be rather intense all night. In the morning I woke to hear my heart pounding and pulsing in my ears and head - what I am told are heart palpitations. The itching subsided after two days. Flu like symptoms started the next night after the shot and subsided after a day. Extreme fatigue began immediately and continues today. Heart palpitations continued for weeks. I sought out my doctors office after a week. During this time I also experienced alarming chest pains and pain while breathing. This confused gor about 3-4 weeks. My doctors office seemed to not know to report this or seek advice so I lingered while tests were being run. I normally had a low heart per my Watch and during this time my heart rate was double my normal resting rate. The chest pains, breathing pains and heart palpitations have improved, but the extreme fatigue continues to impact my ability to keep my normal routine and I?m having to reduce my work hours and take days off just to rest.

Shakin lasted for over 2hrs at which point I took 2 Tylenols. After 20min the shaking decreased. The shaking came back about 1.5hrs later. At that point I took 2 ibuprofens. The shaking went away. The entire following day had mild fever. have been tired physically for a week now after receiving the vaccine. Lost sense of smell and taste on the 3rd day after vaccination. It has since slowly improved. Botox injection sites (received Botox injection for migraine on March 4, 2 days before the J&amp;J vaccine) are still slightly red a week after the vaccine. My facial skin is breaking out also. Vaginal yeast infection started 4 days after receiving the vaccination. I feel slower than usual in my thinking processes since the vaccination.

By the second or third day post-vaccine I developed hives on the back of my neck and shoulders and cold sores on my mouth and nose and continued to have a headache.  I was seen by my doctor on March 12th and was told that I had a sinus infection.  I was prescribed 100 mg Doxycycline Hyclate and began seeing improvements within 36 hours to the sinus infection.  The hives are still clearing up and were not treated.

                                                Left arm was sore after injection, but on day 8 after receiving the vaccine my arm throbs all the time.  I have had pain in my left arm from the shoulder to the elbow for the past 5 days and it seems to get worse.  Ibuprofen and Tylenol did not seem to help much.  It is difficult to use the arm because of the pain .  I can?t sleep right now so I figured I would fill this out.

                                                The next day after the shot, I had a small rash on my wrist.  It disappeared during the day.  Saturday evening, my right thigh felt like it received a trauma like a hit, but I did not have an injury.  An area the size of my hand is slightly pink on the thigh.  On Tuesday, I tried starting ibuprofen, but it did not really remedy the pain.  I went to urgent care Wed. evening.  They sent me for an ultrasound to rule out blood clots.  No blood clots, but lymph nodes were visible in ultrasound.  They suggested I follow-up with PCP.  On Thursday and Friday, the leg felt crampy but less painful.  Friday night the pain traveled down my right leg to ankle as well as right lower lung had dull ache.  Returned to urgent care.  They are treating the leg for cellulitis (1000mg daily of generic Keflex.)  They said if the leg felt better in 24 hrs, probably cellulitis, but if not, it might be a response to vaccine.  There is no relief after 3 doses and 24 hr &#43; later.

I had vomiting and diarrhea for seven hours. I had hives about an hour and a half after the shot all over especially and my feet. The hives were extremely itchy, and my skin felt like it was on fire. The next morning, I went to urgent care and gave me an anti-itch medicine/antihistamine Hydroxyzine. The prescribed medicine knocked me out, but it only helped a little with the itching. The hives stayed for another four days. I have also had severe joint pain that is still lingering in my feet and hands. I don?t normally have joint pain, but it started the day after the shot.

No other symptoms that day. Today is Tuesday,  March 23 and I am still experiencing side effects from the vaccine. The side effects, other than the &#34;brain ache&#34; come and go. The side effects include what I can describe as a &#34;brain&#34; ache, some itching (3/16), random sweating, arms feeling like dead weight, overall general feeling sick, random body aches (don&#39;t last long), dragging of feet when walking, noises being louder than what they actually are, brain &#34;fog&#34;, dizziness, nausea, tingling in legs and feet .  What I describe as a &#34;brain ache is a different feeling than a headache or migraine.  It is as if my brain actually hurts. A very notable side effect that occurred on  Wednesday, March 17, was an episode of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. Throughout my life I have experienced AIWS  at bedtime.  On Wednesday, I experienced an episode during the day and it lasted for three hours.  My session is going to log me out.  I cannot type anymore.  Please contact me for more inforamtion.

                                                I was held for approx 30 minutes. Drove out and when driving home started to get short of breath, so turned towards the hospital rather than home and called them. My significant other also had his shot, so we switched spots driving at that time. I called the hospital on my way when I started to feel my throat start to close at exactly 1829 on my phone (6:29 pm.). Appointment was at 6pm for shot. Hospital was 13 minutes away. Half way there my tongue started to swell and my lips slightly with tingle. My breathing was more labored to keep up effort as I could not expand my lungs to capacity. I was always able to breath and speak, my voice did become more raspy.    Upon ER, Blood Pressure was very Hypertensive around 140s/120s with my respiratory effort to get in. Pulse was stable around 70-80. O2 was 97-99.  I was able to lay down and relax my breathing which relaxed my blood pressure to 140s/ 80s. I was given IV Benadryl, IV Dexadron, PO Pepcid with a liter of fluid. Monitor up until after 8pm when I was released with still mild tonge swelling but breathing ok. Continue Benadryl at home with my Epi pen for bees stings available.    Did go to work today 07/08/2021. Was wheezy, SOB, no throat swelling, tongue swelling at base. Kept up with Benadryl. Made it 1/2 day and went home. Walking and movement makes increase lung workload. My staff concerned with effort and flush skin while getting supplies. But flush and redness does subside some with rest. When talking need to take a break to breath. But can today notice when Benadryl kicks in. No history of Asthma ever or breathing issues ever. Very active on my farm and at work.

                                                Had face and tongue swelling and tingling plus rashes starting about 15 minutes after. It was not severe but lasted entire day. At night I was shivering with fever of 100.6 - 101.3. I had such severe joint and muscle pain I could not lie down. I was so sleepy but had to get out of bed every 90 minutes or so and walk around because the pain was so bad. I was severely nauseated.

                                                Within one minute after the vaccine was administered I felt unable to breathe and was very light headed. I took 25 mg. of Bendryl which helped with the breathing. I felt very faint and experienced episodes of high blood pressure which lead to  uncontrollable shaking. I broke out in hives accross my arms and chest.  I laid with my feet elevated for one hour at which time symptoms subsided and I was able to leave the pharmacy. I had no further allergy type symptoms after leaving the site.

                                                Site of the injection started to burn as I sat in the waiting area.  The best way to describe the burning feeling in my arm  is the feeling of when you receive a local anesthetic or a nerve block at the dentist.  It lasted for 30 seconds to 1 minute .  I began to feel nauseous and hot, I broke into a sweat and called over someone as I felt like I was going to pass out.  All happened within the first 3 minutes in the waiting area.  I sat with the medics for a few minutes and I returned to normal.  I never lost consciousness.  I was able to leave after the 15 minutes.

                                                Headache started on 4/6/2021 hasn?t really gone away altogether just gotten less intense. On Saturday evening my right arm started to hurt from my bicep to my fingers. When I woke up Sunday morning I couldn?t move my arm without extreme muscle and nerve pain. I wasn?t able to make a fist or grip anything in my hand. It eased up throughout Sunday and by the evening it was fine. Also on Sunday morning I vomited twice and once in the evening. By the evening I also had diarrhea, which is still going on. I woke up Monday feeling sore all over had a fever of 101.9. The fever broke the same day. Throughout Monday and more so on Tuesday and today I am constantly itchy especially my fingers. It feels like I have things crawling on me. I called my pcp yesterday (Tuesday) gave them my symptoms told them I had been vaccinated on 4/6. They didn?t call me back until today (Wednesday) &amp; wouldn?t let me split the office fee in two so they wouldn?t see me. I also called the pharmacy on Tuesday  spoke to the pharmacist was advised what was going on is side effects and I needed to report it. The diarrhea and itchy feeling is keeping me from being able to work and I?m not sure what to do from here.

Called and set a telehealth appointment, and was advised to visit urgent care. At urgent care, I was examined and diagnosed with hives. I was given a dose of prednisone and a short prescription for hydroxyzine to help with the itching. I&#39;m still extremely itchy. I&#39;ve never had seasonal allergies, there have been no med, food or product changes, and the prednisone helped briefly but did not eliminate the itchiness. I was told to try an over-the-counter relief products, which I will be trying tomorrow.

                                                The next day after the vaccine around 12n I began feeling really fatigued and developed a fever off and on through out the day which went as high as 101 causing me to take a tylenol.  I had chills, muscle aches and a cough started.  I had a headache on Sat and Sunday. Sunday I was still fatigued,  slight temp, winded and lightheaded more than dizzy.  The temp finally diminished by the Sunday evening but still winded and very fatigued to date.  I reached out to my PCP for the SOB I was experiencing who advised if it gets any worse to go to the ER for further assistance and the symptoms still persisted so on Tues I went to the Urgent Care but they referred me to a outside makeshaft to setup for COVID testing but nothing still was done.  So  I went back to ER who checked my O2 sats which was good but still nothing was done there either and I am still experiencing the SOB.   I developed a bruise on my left forearm which developed yesterday and today my lower legs has developed various light colored little greyish looking bruises and is very sensitive to the touch.

Skin felt like it was burning on legs and arms, felt like rug burn. Sore throat, terrible headache...the worst of this tapered off within two hours or I would have gone to Emergency Room. Was sick for another 48&#43; hours but by then more mild flu symptoms not crazy horrible sickness that first night.

                                                I got the J&amp;J covid vaccine on 4/10/2021 at 11:40am.  Later on that day, my left arm was sore so I took Tylenol.  After my shower that night around 10pm, I felt cold/shaky/chills &amp; had really weird dreams.   The next morning (4/11/2021), I slept in late &amp; was very tired when I woke up.  I also had a headache, fever (100.2F) &amp; nausea. Took 2 Tylenol 500 mg each  &amp; these symptoms went away later that night.   Two days after the vaccine, on 4/12/2021, I woke up with itchy red rashes all over both of my legs &amp; feet (~30 small-med size). Took 2 doses of Zyrtec &amp; Benadryl 50mg twice that day so it wouldn?t itch so much. Also applied mometasone ointment to rashes.   On 4/13/2021, I did a video visit with a doctor.  She said my rashes were probably due to an immune response to the J&amp;J covid vaccine (meaning it is working) &amp; it didn?t look serious since it was only on my legs.  She said to continue the Zyrtec up to 2x/day, Benadryl every 6 hrs if needed, &amp; apply mometasone steroid ointment for the rashes 1x/day.  On 4/14/2021, the rashes have improved and I had less than 10 rashes on my legs.  Since I still had some rashes, I continued to take 1 Zyrtec 10mg in the morning &amp; applied mometasone ointment to the rashes.   On 4/16/2021, the rashes had resolved.

                                                The night after my vaccination I had pain in my ears and had a headache as well as fatigue and overall not feeling well.  By April 8th my symptoms we greatly reduced.  My vaccination spot remained red and wam for the retainer of that week.  I have had a headache since April 13,  2021.  On April 24th I noticed a rash the softball size at my injection site that included lots of red dots all around.  There was also warmth in the rash area.  I went to unspecified pharmacy with my headaches and rash.   Due to my symptoms I was referred to emergency department.

Went to bed for the evening, Monday 4/26/2021 and woke up at 1:50am on Tuesday morning, 4/27/2021 in full body sweats, dripping with sweat.  So weak I couldn&#39;t get up or lift my head.  My husband took my temperature which was 103.  Massive headaches, full body aches and pains, chills which made my body shake uncontrollably.   My whole body hurt.  Could not get up to use the restroom, tried and fainted back into the bed.  Heart felt like it was beating out of my chest.  My husband wanted to call 911 but I didn&#39;t want to.  Felt like I had COVID again.

                                                Calf and forearm muscle stiff and harden, numbness on fee and hand and fuzzy feeling on leg and arm. Fingertips tingling, leg cramp if walk, can&#39;t form word, sharp pain on collar bone (only happen once). Janssen vaccine was administered on Apr 12, 2021. On the same day I have severe headache and mild pain on muscle. Severe headache extends to the next day and occasionally happen during the first week along with mild to moderate muscle pain. On the second week (Apr 19 to Apr 23, 2021) have frequent muscle pain, muscle on calf becomes stiff and harden and occur more frequent. It alternates between right calf and right forearm. I also often have tingling on fingertips, numbness on hand and feeling fuzzy on arm, legs. Symptoms comes and goes but get worse if have short walk. Foot and back of the knee on right leg cramp and more stiffness and more pain. On May 2, I woke up with numbness on my right foot and discover red spot on the instep. This prompt me to go to Urgent care. Since numbness and feeling of fuzzy along arms and legs but at the urgent care could not diagnose since they don&#39;t have tools to run the test so they advise if it bothers me, I should go to the ER. I worry about high cost of ER so I went home and plan to go see family doctor on Monday but just 5 minutes away from urgent care, I have trouble saying out the word that I want to say. It just doesn&#39;t come out although I try to form a word. At that point I more concern if I would have stroke so I ask my husband to turn around to go to Emergency Room. While waiting to be treated, numbness occurs more on feet and under of the forearms, Doctor run blood test, order ultrasounds, MRI scan on the head and EKG. All result came back normal but numbness and headache still persistent. I was discharge in the evening but still have no idea what cause it. The discharge paper indicate that it is &#34;Paresthesia&#34; and I believe Janssen vaccine is the cause for all the symptoms that I have. I still have numbness on feet and leg stiffness still occur even sit down for less than 5 minutes. Should the staff administered the Moderna type that I have signed up for. I believe this side effect won&#39;t happen to me. I signed up for Moderna but after check in, the staff show a note &#34;L@837&#34; to the fire fighter. I don&#39;t know what it means but heard their conversation that &#34;We don&#39;t do that today&#34; then after vaccine was administered, I found out that it is Janssen that I have not signed up for.

                                                A few hours after vaccine, I had been sitting down at a table and I got up to walk and I stepped down on my right foot and it felt like someone kicked me in my lower left leg. Kind of in the shin, but in the inside of the shin. The ball that sticks out - four inches above that on the inside. Every time I took a step it felt like someone was kicking me with a metal toed sharp boot. I hobbled around that day and the next day I realized I couldn&#39;t move on it. The Urgent Care I was closest to that was open didn&#39;t do x-rays. So on Monday, I went to Urgent Care Center - could feel a little knot where the pain was. Pain lasted three and 1/2 days consistently and then that was it. I did keep it wrapped for two weeks like the doctor told me just in case. About 10 days after I had been to the Urgent Care, it happened on my left side - about four inches above the ankle bone on the inside of the shin, I had the same sensation of pain. So I used the wrap for that ankle. It wasn&#39;t as severe as the other side - it was about 30% pain - it felt like someone kicked me with a sneaker instead of a metal pointed boot. That lasted about a day and 1/2 (about 1/2 the time that the right side lasted). I had like something was biting my ankle  - it got to be inflamed - I never had a reaction to a mosquito bite like that - I thought I had scabies. I went to my doctor and he didn&#39;t know what it was. It wasn&#39;t scabies - just a violent, insane reaction to a mosquito bite - it was inflamed, red, bumpy and hard - on my right ankle and also on my left ankle - started small and got to be the size of a quarter. I never reacted to mosquito bites like that in my life. My doctor told me to take Benadryl or Claritin. Normally I take one in the morning at this time of year and I was taking three a day to keep the itching manageable. She gave me a mild steroid cream to put on it - about four or five days after putting the cream on it that it was better. I don&#39;t have any pain above my ankles anymore and the area where the crazy bite reaction was, I can still see but it&#39;s 92% better and that has been almost four weeks ago that it happened. It&#39;s been about 3 weeks since I saw the dr about it.

I don&#39;t even go to the doctor. I went to clinic they prescribed me meds called acyclovir, the second time I went back the blisters were cracking open they gave me Valacyclovir. I was an able to work because of the open blisters., I looked like Donald Duck.

The rashes are itchy but not overwhelmingly bothersome.  evaluating the rash present on her arms was difficult due to her tattoos, but it did appear erythematous, maculopapular and not consistent with Hives/urticaria (no Wheals). The rash lasts longer than 24 hours when it appears.  typically, rash lasts 4-5 days then resolves and can appear elsewhere on the body.  She states they can crop up and last a few days and then subside.

The arm that I got the shot in felt numb. I called the medical people over and they wanted to check me right away. They observed me for 20 minutes and I started having a hard time breathing. I used my epi pen and the ambulance was called and I went to the ER. On Monday, I went to see my doctor and was prescribed medication. I had a hard to walking and still have a hard time breathing and have a cough.

                                                I was getting at home treatments and I was using a lot of medications because I could not get my head to stop hurting. I called my neurologist to schedule and appt. I was having IVIG treatments and the headaches became uncontrollable. I saw Dr. and he advised to continue my medicine and to schedule a f/u. He noticed I developed a rash and he said he thinks it was an autoimmune reaction and I would have to let it run it&#39;s course. I received a shot of Torodol and it helped. It aborted the cycle that I was in. I finally felt like I was able to get everything under control. Overall, my joints still hurt, but I feel that I can manage. My days seems to end early because of extreme fatigue.

                                                There was extreme pain in the injection site immediately. Twelve hours after the shot, I had terrible chills and flu like symptoms that lasted for several days. I then started getting strange pulsing in my legs that moved around and was more prominent at night. I was somewhat short of breath when exerting myself for about a month. Then I had pain that would travel throughout my legs and in my groin.  2 1/2 weeks later it was so bad that I went to the emergency room to be tested for blood clots, which were negative. The pain in my arm dissipated gradually, but 7 weeks later it still hurts enough to wake me up in the middle of the night. The pulsing in my legs has for the most part finally dissipated, but continues from time to time.

                                                Ten minutes after I received the vaccine, my left arm and leg felt very heavy, like I was uneven. I started to feel very dizzy and my left eye became very blurry. I started feeling nauseous, as well. On the car ride home I noticed a rash. We thought it was an allergic reaction. After I got out of the car I noticed it went away. It came back later again, around my neck that evening, but it only lasted 5 minutes. It was a rash with white bumps and then it went away. At night I experienced chills. When I woke up I had a blistering headache with neck pain that lasted a couple days. The nausea and balance picked up and got worse. I spent two weeks being unable to see, walk, read or drive safely. I have had to take time off of work. I cannot view a computer screen without feeling nauseous. Most of the first week I spent on the floor because of the nausea and spinning issues. I sought medical treatment. I had a CAT scan and they ruled out a blood clot. I still have low grade nausea. I have regained peripheral vision in my left eye, which was missing for three weeks. I have been off work for more than 2 weeks. I still cannot work at my normal capacity. I still have a very strong chemical taste in my mouth. It is getting less and less, but I can still taste it. I&#39;ve have a lot of swelling at the base of my skull, that has not resolved.

Just watched them and kept an eye on them and used  Benadryl and anti-itch cream, postponed allergy shots from Friday 4-16 until Monday 4/19.  Hives went away in the next day or two.  2nd event-Lower right back pain achy off and on and eventually wrapping around to the right side.  Went to urgent care on 4/29.  They did a CT with contrast and found a large kidney stone that I would not be able to pass without surgery, referred to neurologist. Saw neurologist on 5/3,  kidney X-ray confirmed an 18 mm kidney stone in my right renal  pelvis. Scheduled lithotripsy with stent placement on 5/10. Had  that done on 5/10. Had follow up kidney X-ray and stent removed on 5/17.  Then on 5/24 another follow up kidney X-ray. Results weren?t easy to see due to gaseous distention but he thought I had passed most of the larger particles. Will see him in 6 months. May see him sooner because I?m still experiencing achy  pain in the same areas off and  on  that same side.

                                                Patient called pharmacy on Thurs 6/3/21 approx. 10:15am to report adverse reaction that she believed to be a result of receiving her COVID vaccine. Patient received Janssen/J&amp;J vaccine (207A21A 06/23/2021; L arm) at our store on Wednesday, 6/2/21. She reported 30 minutes to 1 hour prior to calling us that she started experiencing sharp stomach pain (epigastric region). She denied any history of pancreatitis and has already had her gall bladder removed. I explained that was not one of the common adverse effects from the vaccine, but that it is possible that it could be attributed to the vaccine. I recommended she contact her doctor to see if they want to bring her in and examine her to rule out anything severe that may be going on. If she cannot get in touch with the doctor and the pain becomes severe, I recommended seeking emergency medical help. The only other symptom she had mentioned experiencing was the typical arm soreness at the injection site associated with intramuscular vaccines.

                                                I had swelling in both ankles. I&#39;m having excessive bruising all over in odd spots. Bruises just appear mostly on trunks of body but some on arms and legs. Pain in calves. I went to the doctor. The swelling is less of a problem as I&#39;m wearing compression socks and putting. I am still having quite a bit of pain in my calves, especially later in the day and it&#39;s keeping me off my feet. The bruising is subsiding, I&#39;m noticing a sudden appearance of spider veins, and also some of my veins on are leg (left leg) they are near the skin and they have become more visible and when I wear the compression socks those veins hurt. I realized that was the site of the pain were where those veins are so I took the compression socks off and that helped to alleviate the pain. The compression socks were kind of aggravating those veins. Leg pain is still an issue.

Have recovered from this.  The next day, 24th, evening about 06:00 pm - rash on hands. It was the same on both hands. It is red with little red marks. Not a bump. It isn&#39;t itchy and doesn&#39;t hurt at all - it&#39;s between index finger and thumb on both of my  hands and it spreads out between the fleshy part between the hand and the knuckle : Thumb, index finger, middle finger and pinky there&#39;s a red splotch on each of those parts of both hands. It&#39;s exactly the same on both hands. Called Dr on Friday morning. I will watch it to see what it does. No bumps and no discomfort (not dry or itchy). It just stays there (little tiny red spots) - been there for five days.

I still have the rash for the shingles and I can still see the bite infections. The poison ivy has dried up but can still see it on my leg. I got an anti-biotic for the deer fly bite. I got a Steroid Prednisone for the poison ivy. There was nothing they could do for the shingles because it was too late. First I went to Urgent Care - and that&#39;s where I got the antibiotic. After that, I went to the doctor and they gave me the Steroid and then went back to doctor and they increased the steroid.

                                                The day after I got my shot I had a lot of pain in my arm at the injection site. I was a little fatigued. The pain remained in my arm and is still there currently. My doctor advised me my vaccine may have been injected to high . As a result of the pain I was prescribed an anti inflammatory Diclofenac Sodium 75mg 2xdaily which I have been taking for 2 weeks now.  My doctor also referred me to a physical therapist because he felt there was a possibility of a pinched nerve in my neck. The pain has since moved through my entire arm and through my fingers as well. It feels similar to Tennis arm. It has also caused difficulty with sleeping at night.

Day 7-present Knot harder and maybe bigger. And the tingle in the arm and fingers  is back. I&#39;ve done some  research and this is not mentioned anywhere. Especially at 12 days. Nor anyone i know with this symptom. I thought it was worth mentioning. Will call doctor if arm tingle doesn&#39;t go away by early next week.

When I got up, my eyes were almost swollen shit.  The whole day of 3/18/2021, it felt like bees were stinging my eyes.  I did have the corona virus in December and my eyes reacted the same way at the end of my sickness.

                                                I believe the shot was improperly administered too close to my shoulder joint, and as a result, I have experienced increasing pain over the last 11 days.  Initially, there was mild pain (I would rate a 3-4 out of 10) near the injection site immediately which persisted for days as expected after getting a shot; mainly discomfort during sleep and when moving my arm. Pain has become progressively worse, and not better as reported to be a normal and expected side effect. At day 10 I called my PCP to go in for an exam. She ordered an Xray and prescribed muscle relaxers. Xray showed no signs of breakage (as expected).  Today is day 11 and  I can barely move or lift my arm without severe discomfort, I would rate the pain as severe (9 out of 10) when moving or lifting my arm, rotating shoulder, sleeping on it.  While I have not been diagnosed with anything in particular yet, I believe I have a shoulder injury relating to improper vaccine administration (SIRVA). I have requested to be referred to a shoulder specialist for evaluation. I have not had prior injuries or symptoms in this area. I am an active and healthy person with no known health conditions and this is very troubling. I am a strong advocate for COVID vaccines, yet, I must say this experience has me questioning my decision to get one.  I never knew this could happen, and I sincerely hope my shoulder is not permanently impacted by this event.

About 12 hours later, I had facial swelling.  One full day later, a chain-like rash appeared on my arms, chest, thighs, and feet.  Each subsequent day is spread to a new body part (but never occurred on my face),  I had to take Benadryl EVERY 4-5 hours to keep everything at bay.  Three days into the event my neck and torso skin were extremely painful to touch.  Most days since, I am exhausted and get winded easily.  Today is 30MAR21 and it&#39;s happening again as it began on 21MAR21.  I took two Benadryl in the hopes I will not have to go to ER again.

                                                I am having neck pain and left arm pain.  I would say that the arm pain may be muscular.  I have been taking  ibuprofen and tylenol fo the past few days.  I went to the Chiropractor and had temporary relief of the neck pain.  It lasted for maybe 10 minutes it is hard to turn my head to the left.  I am just letting you know about the reaction.    The other thing is that the injection area the first day was very itchy I know better than to scratch it.  It becomes very itchy on and off yesterday and today.  These are probably not what you want for adverse side effects but I am letting you know that this is the case with me.

                                                The patient received the Janssen Covid 19 vaccine (lot 1805022) on 3/17/21. Today (4/5/21) the patient called to report several adverse reactions. She stated that she had body aches and chills the day after the vaccine. The aches went away but the patient reports that the chills in her hands, legs, and feet have persisted. The patient also said that she started to have facial paralysis on 4/3/21. Also on 4/3/21 she reported developing multiple skin rashes on different areas of the body. She also said she went to the ER and had multiple tests run, including an MRI to rule out stroke. She did report to her primary care doctor who advised her to see a Neurologist. I offered to reach out to her primary care but she did not provide the information. I advised the patient that she would need to seek care from a provider who could assess and treat her as needed. I called Janssen and they said the facial paralysis is a very rare possibility but did not have any additional information to provide me. They advised me to tell the patient to seek medical care as necessary. I spoke with the patient multiple times this evening and provided her with the information to VAERS and Vsafe. I also let her know that I contacted Janssen and gave her the information they gave me. I expressed to her that I understood that she was concerned and she could reach out to me if needed. I also will follow up with her later in the week.

I alerted the nurse - she took my blood pressure and it was very high (XXX/110). EMTs were called in case I was having an allergic reaction, but I did not have any other symptoms of allergies, just a very high BP and heart rate. At this point I&#39;m sure anxiety drove my BP higher, on top of the reaction, since I was concerned I was going to go into anaphylaxis, but the original racing heart started within one minute of the injection while I was beginning my 15 minute wait time near the injection station. I worked on regulating my breathing and with the EMTs monitoring, my BP down to a manageable but still elevated rate after about 20 minutes. I did not go to the hospital. Once I was resting at home it took about 4 hours before I felt my heart rate was at a normal level and the feeling of racing was gone.  I did not have any other adverse reactions until 4/7/2021 which is the first day that the injection site (upper L arm) started aching.

I felt my throat constricting a bit.  The rash itchiness is still ongoing.

Following the headache I experienced bruising on my thighs, tightness in my left arm, bruising oat the injection site for at least one month and a weighted feeling on my chest along with tightness and shortness of breath. Subsequently, I experienced blurred vision and loss of sight one month following injection. The loss of sight lasted close to 10 minutes.

                                                About 3 hours after receiving the , vaccine on April 5 at 3:15 pm, I had uncontrollable shivers and chills, shaking violently through my whole entire body.  I was freezing cold to the bone.   I felt nauseous and threw up my entire dinner.  That didn&#39;t make the nausea go away - I continued to throw up that evening 5 or 6 more times.  The nausea continued the next day making me throw up 3 more times.  And yet the nausea persisted for a whole entire week.  I had a horrible headache that night that has stuck with me these last ten days.  My muscles ached and shot strange pangs through my body.  I was exhausted.  I could not stay awake.  I was so weak and tired.  I had no energy and just laid in bed for a solid four days. My throat hurt, my neck hurt, my head hurt, my arm where the shot went in hurt so bad.  Very strangely, my stomach was constantly bloated and hurt inside like a bad stomach ache - even if I hadn&#39;t eaten anything it still bloated and hurt.  The painful stomach lasted seven or eight days.  I had diarrhea for those seven /eight days.  I was completely dehydrated.  The diarrhea lasted way too long - it was difficult to return to work.  The second day after the shot I woke up to my left eye red, like some blood vessels had burst.  It took four or five days for my eye to go back to normal.   my heart has a stabbing feeling randomly all the time now and it is hard to breathe.  I wheeze and cough all the time.  It is very uncomfortable.  This heart issue has persisted the entire time since getting the vaccine.

                                                Within 5 minutes of the shot, I started to have difficulty swallowing. I notified the staff at the clinic, They put me in a separate room where I took 50mg Benadryl. I continued having difficulty swallowing along with tingling in tongue and lips. I then decided to give myself an Epipen 0.3mg shot. I had this with me because I had a severe allergic reaction in January to Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. 911 was called. In the ambulance, IV Benadryl and Solu-Medrol was administered. My face was starting to itch on the way to hospital even after IV medication administered.  I was monitored for 2 hours in hospital. I was also given normal saline IV in the hospital. I was discharged with Pepcid 20mg daily for 4 days and Prednisone 50mg daily for 3 days. I consistently had to take Benadryl 50mg for three days to keep itching and swelling at bay.

                                                Immediate muscle tension in left arm  following vaccine shot in left arm.  The soreness persisted for several days. Painful to lift left arm higher than my shoulder.  The morning of day 3, I woke up to feel a pronounced skin irritation under my left armpit.  Later that day, I noticed a small welt on my left arm and the irritation had grown to include my upper left arm front and back. Over the next few days, the number of welts increased and the pain was increasing from the skin irritation. The tension in my shoulder started to give way to feeling tightness in my left chest.   I reported the symptoms. I tried to report to the Health Department, but they wouldn&#39;t take a report stating that the symptoms I was reporting did not match &#34;known symptoms&#34;.  On 4/13/21, I went to the Urgent Care to have the rash examined. The doctor tentatively diagnosed as Shingles. However, because of the chest pain, he referred to the Emergency Room for blood tests to rule out a possible Pulmonary Embolism.  The blood tests came back normal. I was prescribed 12 Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen for the pain and discharged.  On 4/15/21 I returned to Urgent Care because the welts were continuing to spread and the pain was increasing. Including sharp pains associated with the shingles. At this visit I was prescribed 21 tablets of Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen and 21 tablets of ValACYclovir.

I had a headache, body aches fever and chills. I experienced nausea for a couple of days and a rash on my back. It was a bumpy rash started a week after the shot and is still present. I was very unsteady on my feet and needed help to the bathroom. I missed work that day but went to work the next day. I felt very poorly with no energy for a week. I was super achy and have no balance. I have gotten stabbing pains in my legs especially in my right thigh which dissipate after a while. It has been ten days and I am still very tired with intermittent headaches, but I was able to work out today. My leg pain is less often and less than it used to be.

Not sharp pain, but achey pain in both legs that can not be controlled by Tylenol or Ibuprofen. It has been occurring every few days and some nights like last night are bothersome and I can not sleep well. Also after about a week, I had dryness and redness on the bottom part of my mouth and chin.  In the last week I have had flush on my neck and chest.  It is hot, sometimes causes dryness and pealing and is sometimes itchy.

                                                I had the expected side effects for four days. The headache and Nausea lasted the full four days. I had a rash on my right shoulder four days after the shot. It was a red patch that was itchy and lasted for two days.   Two weeks after the shot I had leg fatigue and weakness. I normally get tension headaches but the pain in my left leg was from my knee to my groin. It started as a sharp pain and then it became a dull ache that was there all day. The leg pain was spreading, and my headache had been there for four days. I was advised to go the ER because of family history and the current news about the vaccine.  I was discharged after eight hours and all tests were negative. I was told that the headache had progressed to a Migraine and prescribed Toradol.

A few weeks after the vaccine I was experiencing PMS symptoms (breast tenderness, hormone imbalance, breakouts, light cramping etc) and today I began what appears to be my first day.  I was menopausal &amp; my last period was December 2018.  This is unusual.

                                                8 hr post vaccine, typical side fx (fever, headache), but also significant bi-lateral leg cramping and spasms that continued for 6-8 hours.  Spasms were prominent in inner thigh/groin and down entire legs.  Legs were not movable (heavy), difficult to get out of bed or walk.  Very strange and nothing like this ever experienced before shot. Fine next day.  Around 4/9, pain began in ball of R foot in the AM, hard to walk.  Over next few days, pain extended up to medial posterior calf (very painful), back of knee and groin.  Unexplained bruising on lateral calf.  4/20 woke to swelling of R leg (ankle, posterior knee, groin), went to Urgent Care that night and was sent directly to ER for DVT symptoms.   ER Ultrasound showed no clot, was sent home.  Pain continued to increase, with burning and difficulty walking.  Second Ultrasound done 4/22.  No clots found.  Pain continued to worsen, with swelling/aching on front of calf and severe foot pain.  Veins/skin tender.  Painful groin spasms happen again, same as night of shot.  PCP ordered ABI and spine Xray.  ABI was normal.  Xray showed same issue as 29 yrs ago (prior known L5S1 anterolisthesis; have not had back pain for many years...when I did, it was localised to spine and sciatic in the L hip, was not at all similar to these current issues in R leg.  perhaps related if inflammed, but is vastly different in symptoms and unlike past history).  Saw Vascular Surgeon 4/30, ordered abdominal CT Abdomen Pelvis w IV Contrast.  results normal. arm bruising at IV and blood draw site.  Saw second Vascular Surgeon 5/4 who felt pain related to inflammation response and ordered CBC.  Platelets 178. (patient had requested this test starting on 4/20, this was the first doctor to order it).  Pain continued but some relief found with compression socks.  on 5/10 US Bilateral lower extremity venous duplex with reflux study was done on both legs.  No DVTs, but damaged valves and reflux in the external iliac common femoral vein and femoral veins proximal segment (worse in R leg)  and great saphenous vein at the sapheno-femoral junction (R only).  These areas are where the spasms are happening but doctor not able to conclude relation, wants neuro consult, could be nerves causing spasms. Doctor prescribed compression socks for venous insufficiency concerns, to be rescanned annually for life. Vascular test results don&#39;t explain severe pain in calf and foot and referred to Neurologist for 5/28 visit.  As of today, 5/22, pain is persistent.  Pain/swelling is reduced with use of compression socks but returns without them; walking is difficult in the AM and PM hours; night time spasms.  Have also had shooting pains in L calf, both forearms, and ribs (back).  These occur mostly in the evening (nerve?).  Taking magnesium &amp; extra vitamin D seems to help some. On strict anti-inflammatory diet.  I&#39;d really like some guidance for treatment and what to do about boosters - do I switch to an mRNA vaccine?  I am a very healthy active 49 yr old woman who felt fine before the shot, and now I&#39;ve been in a lot of pain, working greatly reduced hours for almost 4 weeks.  Please advise on what can be done to help.  Concerned about permanent damage and how to handle future vaccines.  (also of note:  first menstruation period was skipped after the shot, second period came a week late and was very heavy with bright red blood.  I am normally extremely regular, mod-heavy flow;  also, the J&amp;J shot I had was a &#34;last shot of the day&#34; extra dose.  I was offered it while having a routine physical.  Could it have been improperly stored, as the last leftover dose?  Very unlikely since it was a doctors office, but including this info)

Next thing I know, I was on the floor. When I came to, I was disoriented and very sweaty.  The fall caused a cut to my head, bleeding and a bruised elbow. Within an hour, I was feeling less dizzy.

By that evening I felt much better with just a headache and by the following day all symptoms subsided    I had hardly any Odin at the injection site unless I pushed or laid on it and no swelling or rash at all.

I had on Sunday, the day after I had pain under my left rib toward my side, leg and groin. I had developed red spots on my legs. I contacted my PCP and they sent my platelet test and it can back ok. I went in to see my PCP and he checked me and only thing he came up with  due to my auto immune disease it triggered inflammation.  I&#39;m still in pain everywhere and can&#39;t touch certain parts of my body, my Dr. can&#39;t figure out where it&#39;s from and believes it&#39;s from the shot. If it&#39;s not better in a week he wants me to go back.

Second day, I was extremely tired with a fever. I couldn&#39;t work for the remaining day. I noticed a small rash on my right leg which was not there before. I was itchy. fever went down to 100. I&#39;ve taken over the counter medication. I&#39;m still exhausted. I experience some numbness last night. it has subsided but my arm is still extremely soar. I&#39;m still exhausted.

                                                Within minutes of getting the shot, my throat became itchy and the roof of my mouth felt like it was burning.  I started breaking out in hives , coughing and trying to clear my throat.  I was taken to the medical area and given a dose of liquid Benadryl.  Within 20 minutes it was easier to breathe and my blood pressure and pulse ox returned to normal.  About 3 hours later I started to get itchy again around my throat and ears.  Per the guidance of the nurse at the vaccine site, I took 2 - 25mg Benadryl tablets.  By the next morning I felt better.

                                                An immediate burning sensation at the vaccination site as the vaccine was being injected. The burning sensation spread from the injection site upward to my  neck all the way to my right ear. The burning sensation then started from my injection site down to my elbow. The burning sensation stopped after a few minutes, then I felt silently nauseous and lightheaded.   After waiting 15 minutes I felt fine enough to go home. However, the pain and stiffness in my neck was ongoing throughout the following day and night and was only slightly relieved with 500mg doses of Tylenol every 4-5 hours.  On a couple of occasions the day of and the day following the vaccination I did feel fleeting chest pain, but not enough pain or intensity to warrant a trip to the doctor. This morning (4-11/21) the aching sensation in my neck and arm (primarily neck) have lessened, but still present.

Took Benadryl for two days.  The itching was getting worth.  Went to see  a doctor who prescribed IC Prednisone 10 mg tablet.  On the 3rd of taking the IC Prednisone, I felt dizzy and fainted, lose consciousness.  Ended up in ER.  Multiple bruises, lost 4 front teeth.

It is sore to the touch and I cannot raise my arm above my head, I can lift shoulder level with minor pinching pain. But if I try to lift any higher it is severe pain inside the muscle of the bicep area where the shot was administered .  It has been constant pain since the shot and with ibuprofen and ice pack it is tolerable.

                                                I received my shot at 10 a.m. on a Thursday morning. Around 6 p.m. on the evening of the shot, I began experiencing severe chills, and I threw up once. The chills lasted approximately four hours. In addition, I had an extreme headache. Once the chills subsided, I began sweating profusely through my clothes. I still had the headache. Around 2 a.m. in the morning, I was unable to stand or speak for about an hour.  Once I was finally able to move again, my skin - not my body, but my skin - hurt all over. I could not lay on my back due to extreme pain in my skin, particularly the skin on my back, shoulders and buttocks. Anything that touched my skin, no matter how light of a touch, felt like I was being severely bruised. My skin was in pain for about four hours. The sweating continued through the following Sunday morning.  I soaked through multiple sets of clothing and woke up every morning completely drenched. When I weighed myself Sunday morning, concerned about dehydration, the scale reflected a 4.2 pound weight loss over the course of less than three full days.  The headache lasted through Tuesday, April 14th, a total of five days with a strong headache. I am still experiencing some sweating but not like the initial round of sweating. Because my shot was given on a Thursday, I only missed one full day of work. However, had the shot been given at the beginning of the week, I am confident that I would have missed at least three full days, it was so debilitating.

SHE WAS FINE FOR 24-48 HOURS WHEN ALL THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED SYMPTOMS RETURNED BUT EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED AND SHE HAD EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA WITH INCREASED PAIN AT THE INJECTION SITE.  AT SOME POINT DURING ALL THIS SHE VISITED HER MAIN PHARMACY AND AS SHE WAS TELLING THE PHARMACIST ABOUT HER SYMPTOMS SHE FAINTED AND WOKE TO EMS AND WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL.  THE ER DID NOT FIND ANY REASON FOR HER FAINTING. SHE WAS HYDRATED AND THINKS IT WAS ANXIETY BROUGHT ON BY HER EXPERIENCE.  SHE CALLED ME TODAY 4/15/21 TO TELL ME ABOUT HER SYMPTOMS AND EXPERIENCE. SHE STATED THAT SHE HAD A NEW SYMPTOM OF A SHARP PAIN IN HER BACK SO I STRONGLY SUGGESTED SHE GO BACK TO ER TO CONTINUE TESTING IN CASE THE PAIN WAS SOMEHOW RELATED TO THE VACCINE INCIDENT. SHE SAID SHE WOULD GO TO URGENT CARE IF SHE FELT THE PAIN WAS BAD ENOUGH.

I felt fine and went to work but in the afternoon, I started not feeling too well and my arm was hurting where the injection was and it was very swollen. Friday, 9th,- I went to Urgent Care - the physician assistant said the injection was given too low in the arm. It wasn&#39;t in the muscle. It created a rash and cellulitis. I had a big bump on my arm. She told me to wait and see. Friday afternoon I experienced diarrhea and  had that through Monday. Treated it with Imodium on Friday night - (two doses) and one dose on Saturday. On Sunday, I didn&#39;t take any. On Monday, I did take one dose of Imodium. From Friday through Sunday I was real sick and couldn&#39;t go anywhere and stayed in bed. I couldn&#39;t even do a telephone video Dr. visit because I was sick. I went to a different Urgent Care on Monday. He said the injection was a fail. It should have been up in my arm muscle and it was too low in the arm. He said it looked like it might be infected. He prescribed something but said I could wait a day or two first to see if it went away.  I waited for two days first before starting the prescription and I started using the prescription on Wednesday the 14th. My arm is starting to feel a little better today but it&#39;s itchy around the bump. He also  said that my diarrhea might have been from a flu virus - he didn&#39;t know if it was from the vaccine. The diarrhea went away on Monday, the 12th, if the afternoon.  (Note - They ran out of the vaccine and a new dose of the vaccine was needed to be obtained from Walgreens while I was waiting in line. - when the new batch came they said that this new dose was the same lot number. But Just wanted to note this in case the lot number was different with this batch.)

Also started feeling some tightness in the left eye today. Have a Dr appointment but on May 17th and going to urgent care today. Advised to go to HCF instead of urgent just to ensure they can get imaging, US and appropriate testing&#39;s to r/o all cause of complications.  4/20-f/u pc to caller; couldn&#39;t sleep last night; used a heating pad on her leg but didn&#39;t work; states both legs hurt; feel tight; 4/10 pain; worried when also saw spots on her left leg and became concerned because saw news of clots; the episode started with tightness of her right leg which progressed to most of leg as well as left leg. Has not gotten worse today and denies any concominant effects. Normally healthy. Did not go to the hospital because says she wouldn&#39;t be able to afford it. Has appointment with primary care in 2 weeks.   rec&#39;d that since she is still ok today then it&#39;s likely ok to skip the ER and go see MD as planned; warned to go to the ER right away or dial 911 if any of the following effects: sudden shortness of breath, severe headache, vision changes, loss of motor or/sensory function, chest pain. Call us back if having any effects at all besides the ones already noted so we may help determine if needs ER care.

                                                My arm still has pain in the local area where I received the shot.  It is a dull ache about a 2-3 on scale and persistent.  It feels deep as if in the bone.  There is no rash or swelling and never was a rash or swelling. This persistent ache is over a month now and has not diminished.  I did have mild fever and felt puny 2 days after the shot which is fine/expected and that went away.  The arm pain concerns me.

Weakness the whole of next day and then was ok after that. Happened  approx 3 weeks after first dose. Also was already suffering from severe pinched nerve in neck (this came on suddenly a week or so after the vaccination.. no accident or injury,  not sure if anything to do with vaccine) and was taking pain killers.

                                                3/15/21: Within a few hours of the vaccine, I felt fatigued, followed by chills, severe body aches, fever, and dehydration (in that order). Improved by Day 5. 4/5/21:  Lump on left thigh appeared. Raised up, hard, red, and warm.  Went to  Clinic  ER immediately. Ultrasound of area and blood work showed no obvious abnormalities. Symptoms were diagnosed as &#34;insect bite&#34;. Lump became painful several hours later. Antibiotics, Benadryl, and Corticortisone prescribed for 10 days. Took medication as instructed. Improvement by Day 7. Lump shrunk but did not completely resolve. Swelling and pain gone.  Completed medication on 4/15/21. 4/22/21:  Lump returned on left thigh, quickly turning into a large, solid mass. Red, warm, more swollen than the first time, and more tender to the touch and painful.  4/23/21:  Went to Walk-In Clinic , Nurse Practitioner ordered MRI and more blood work. 4/25/21:  Lump appeared on right thigh, same characteristics as the left thigh, also quickly turning into a large mass. Very painful. Hip size increased from 40 to 42 inches within a few days from the swelling.  Unable to wear underwear due to how excruciatingly painful the area(s) were.  Painful to sit, painful to stand up, painful to remain standing. Sharp shooting pains. Legs would feel as though they would give in if I stayed standing up too long. 4/28/21: Returned to Walk-In Clinic due to unbearable pain and nightly fevers. Antibiotics were prescribed on this visit, and a referral to a general surgeon and a Hematologist were made by the Nurse Practitioner who tended to me, . 5/3/21:  Went to see Orthopedic Surgeon Dr. . He reviewed the MRI with me and showed me the areas where fluid was all over in the area affected (thigh). Referred me to Dr. , Rheumatologist. 5/4/21:  Dr.  examined both thighs and determined a biopsy under general anesthesia was needed in order to do deep tissue removal. He also ordered more blood work.  5/4/21:  Initiated surgery preparations: Lab work, COVID testing, EKG, Chest X-Ray, Visit with General Practitioner to be cleared for the surgical procedure, Visit with surgery department.  5/6/21:  Surgical biopsy under general anesthesia performed. 5/13/21: Visit with Dr.  to remove surgical gauze, and examine the area.  5/14/21:  Visit with Dr.  for pathology / biopsy results.  I was informed that inflammation levels in my body were at 45%, where they should normally be at 8%.  Pathology concluded that an external cause was to blame for the inflammation, further stating that it was a foreign substance consistent with silicone injected in the area.  It is noted that I have no silicone implants in any part of my lower body. Nor have I had any silicone injected in my thighs. 5/17/21:  While using a pair of scissors and exercising normal pressure to cut a paper tag from new clothing, the area below my right thumb suddenly became swollen, purplish, and extremely tender. After two hours of no improvement, went to  Health where they took an X-ray and determined it was a Sprain.  I did not exercise any force to justify a sprain in that region. I was prescribed cortisone for 6 days. 5/20/21:  Follow up visit with Dr. , Rheumatologist, for second opinion on pathology results. Dr.  ordered blood work done in-office, as well as ordered additional blood work to be done at the lab.  Results pending. After also examining all of my blood work done up until that point, she deduced that the issue with my hand was also likely caused by inflammation in my body,  and whatever is causing the swelling in my thighs. The area of the hand turned black and blue the likes of severe trauma, yet there was no blunt force to the area. At the time of this reporting, I continue on blood thinner and anti-inflammatory medication for another 10 days to complete the 30 days post surgery. Additional blood work has been ordered to measure the inflammation levels and proceed accordingly.  Currently I feel throbbing in my legs mostly at night when I lie down. Prior to the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine, I had no medical issues. My only visits were routine control visits annually. I do not drink or smoke; and exercise regularly (until this happened).

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, and batch number: 1805029 expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total administered to left deltoid on 14-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. The patient received Benadryl unspecified (form of admin and route of admin were not reported, batch number: unknown expiry: unknown) dose and frequency were not reported from MAR-2021 for itchy rash. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 14-MAR-2021, after eight hours of vaccination, the patient woke up with intense muscle cramping which she had anticipated but also had joint cramp. The patient had temperature of 103.5 (unit unspecified) and the patient&#39;s right side of face was itching down into under her ears which also started to swell. The patient had a rash on her legs, arms, face and everything was itchy for her. The patient took a diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and then she had headache, dizziness, ringing in the right ear, nausea, and her fever jumped to 104. The patient laid down her head into floor because the dizziness was so bad and she ended up in more muscle cramping. The patient&#39;s fever never went away but went down and did not go for about a week and three days; the fever was just hanging out at 100 (unit unspecified) the whole time. The patient&#39;s dizziness and ringing was going on and also had GI (gastrointestinal) problems and really bad headache. The patient called a healthcare company and ordered meclizine (Meclizine) but did not specified she administered it or not. On 26-MAR-2021, the patient could not take the stomach pain, cramping, diarrhea, high fever, rectal bleeding and mucusy and bloody stool. The patient had intense abdominal pain and GI (gastrointestinal) issues after three days of her fever and was taken to ER (emergency room) and was confirmed that the patient had renal insufficiency and medication induced colitis. The patient had colitis and was given with metronidazole (Flagyl), however she had low grade fever, dizziness, ringing in ears, really bad headache and was admitted to hospital on 28-MAR-2021. The patient&#39;s CRP (C-reactive protein) was up, lactic acid was elevated, hemoglobin went from 14 down to 12, WBC count elevated, occult blood was positive and also had rectal bleeding, a foggy headache and dizziness feeling. The patient felt something was way off in her body at the side, also had a small orange halo on arm at the injection site which got resolved after four days. The patient had undergone unspecified tests and the results was negative. The patient liver enzymes were too off which was hand in hand with medication induced colitis. The patient had a small internal hemorrhoid and removed a polyp. The patient&#39;s heart rate experienced some issues as well. The patient was hospitalized for 6 days. The patient was discharged on 02-APR-2021.The patient had a follow-up with her physician on the next day of this report.

I decided to put ice on them and slept with them elevated.  I went to the doctor and they gave me a ointment to put on my legs.  The ointment helped a little at first but then they changed my medication for my thyroid medicine the pain went away.

The area is mildly sore if she presses or lays on it.  She believes that this is due to the vaccine itself. She also reported burning, which she may feel is just her imagination.  Lastly, she reported weakness which she is unsure if it&#39;s due to her repetitive arm injury or the vaccine.   Patient reported chills, fever, body aches, and extreme fatigue for 3 days which gradually improved and were gone by the 4th day.

Vaccine was on 4/9/21 and I had zero reactions, arm wasn&#39;t even sore really unless I poked at it.  Later, weekend of the 24-25th, I had a sunburn on the back of my neck, neosporin burn ointment was applied (and this may have caused the reaction but no one is sure).  Reaction was rash that slowly grew, covering areas under armpits, inner arms, sides and stomach.  Multiple trips to urgent care where they couldn&#39;t diagnose the issue and kept prescribing more steroids, antibiotics and antihistamines.  Finally was referred to allergy/dermatologist specialist,  biopsy was taken, results showed extremely high concentration of a certain kind of cell that indicates an allergic reaction - they were sure it&#39;s a reaction to some kind of medicine or medical treatment but were unable to positively identify whether it would have been the neosporin, the antibiotics, or some other thing.  My bet is that it&#39;s a neosporin reaction and not related to the vaccine.  I am only reporting this to be thorough, just in case.  The rash is now pretty much gone, with just some residual itchiness.

Though the majority of the symptoms subsided within 24 hours, I continued to experience headache symptoms for several days.  On 12 April 2021, I woke up with a broken blood vessel in my left eye and  red and black eyelid.  The blood from broken blood vessel continued to get worse.  I went to the ER to have tests run because the J&amp;J vaccine was removed from use during this time.

It lightly sting nothing bad.  - About 40 min later on both sides of my back I felt tingling right below my shoulder blades  and then this spread out like a waterfall going down my back .  - about an hour later it was like someone turned my power off. I was so tired I could barely open the car door and walk inside - laid down and slept maybe 3 hours ? - woke up hurting and puking  - hot and cold and exhausted  - slept next day . Not hungry but husband bright oatmeal and coffee. I ate a bite and threw it all up  - my body get like it had become broken glass . It hurt . It hurt to walk to the kitchen . My eyelashes hurt , my nails hurt . Stayed in bed. Ate a TV dinner and threw it up . Feverish . Sweating hot cold . Felt like a migraine headache I guess around my forehead and eyes - and I have never had one .  - day 3 - nauseous. Took shower and big clumps of my hair fell out . Feet hurt and tingled. Felt like a spike gong through my right side off and on .   Day 4 - slept all day and had to drive 8 hours home.  My left eye hurt and was draining . When I got home I looked in the mirror and the left side of my face was swollen really badly and eye about swollen shut. Felt bad . Achy and stabbing side pain .  Went to Urgent Er care due to  face  swelling .  They had no explanation .  Had a cyst like pimple on left side under eye that went back up to eye lid   Could not turn my neck and really sore . Went to Chiropractor doctor. He and his assistant examined me and said I was not out of alignment but my lymph nodes around my neck area and left side of my spleen were very swollen .  He said to go to dentist over face swelling and I probably had an infected tooth   Went to dentist . Teeth were fine but he said to go to the eye doctor .  Still feeling sick and very achy . Hurt to walk . Knees hurt . Felt like I was 100 years old   Went to eye doctor .   He examined my eye then had me go to another room and machine . Then a variety of students came in to look at my eye . I asked why and one said because they only read about this in text book. Doctor came bAck and said I had acute narrow angle eye closure and had to do emergency surgery .  Still feel horrible   Labs now coming back with odd things .

I am now 72 hours from time of vaccination and red site is larger and more painful.  I also had a low fever last night  (100) which is high for me, since cancer treatment I struggle to get a fever, just the side effects ( chills aches). I was also very fatigued yesterday morning and the day before.

Emergency Department Attending Attestation Note   See resident/PA/student note for further details of HPI, history, exam, ED course, and diagnoses.   Briefly, this is a 51 y.o. female with PMH reviewed in chart and w/ patient notable for insulin dependent diabetes, depression, prothrombin mutation, migraine, p/w concern for allergic reaction.  Emesis or change in Covid vaccine today.  10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, patient reports feeling thick in her tongue with tingling in her lips.  Patient was given Zertec.  The minutes later, her lips began to swell up and was also noted to have new erythematous rash between her eyes and forehead.  Patient was given 50 mg of Benadryl.  Patient felt like she could not swallow with worsening lip swelling.  She was given EpiPen and 911 was called. No stridors.  No wheezing.  Reports continued tingling and the numbness in her mouth but no lip swelling or tongue swelling.  Denies any difficulty swallowing at this time.  No wheezing.  No abdominal pain or nausea.  No rash at this time.   Of note, patient also notes left-sided facial, arm, and leg numbness starting about 10 minutes prior to arrival to the emergency department.  She reports that she has had recurrent numbness on the left side in the past, which was thought to be due to migraine versus TIA.  She has had extensive work-up and multiple hospitalization for this symptom.  She reports that she is allergic to iodine and gadolinium containing contrast.  Denies any headache at this time though she had a mild headache after receiving the vaccine.  Denies any blurry vision.  Denies any weakness in her bilateral upper and lower extremities.  Assessment and Plan:    Vital signs notable for O2 sat of 96 to 98% on room air without tachypnea.  Patient is mildly hypertensive.  Patient is well-appearing speaking full sentences without any dysarthria.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Extraocular movement intact.  She notes diminished sensation to her left face, left upper extremity, and left lower extremity.  Tongue is midline.  Hearing is intact bilaterally.  No facial droop.  She has 5 out of 5 strength in bilateral upper and lower extremities.  No pronator drift.  Normal gait.  No tongue swelling or lip swelling.  No stridors.  No uvula swelling.  No pharyngeal or erythema.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezing or rhonchi.  Cardiac exam without murmurs rubs or gallops.  Regular rhythm.  No abdominal distention or tenderness on palpation.  No CVA tenderness.   51-year-old female who is presenting to the emergency department with improving lip swelling and numbness in her mouth, raising a concern for anaphylaxis related to her Covid vaccine.  Reassuringly, status post EpiPen, her symptoms are improving.  However, she has new onset left-sided numbness, with without any headache.  She reports that she has had this numbness in the past the last time she had the numbness on the left side was approximately 10 years ago.  Her neurologic exam is only notable for diffuse numbness on her left side including her face.  Differential diagnosis include migraine headache and TIA.  Stroke is possible though less likely given the patient has had the same symptoms in the past with negative work-up.  Will defer code stroke at this time but will emergently consult neurology.  Will get labs including BMP and CBC.  We will continue to monitor her from the anaphylaxis perspective.  We will also give her a dose of steroid.  Prednisone 60 mg by mouth given 12:29 PM  NEUROLOGY CONSULT NOTE  Assessment: Formulation- Diagnosis is guarded. Localization structurally would suggest subcortical (thalamic) or small brain-stem in a sensory territory on the right. Etiologies could be stroke given her vascular risk factors but seems unlikely given there is stereotypy of earlier symptomatology. Demyelinating would be another possibility as well, but again, the stereotype. Seizure unlikely because of the timing of rush from toes to body was minutes and duration of some occasions being days. Complicated migraine possible, has some risk factors, but should be treated as dx of exclusion. She does make complaint of headache, which could support. Some FND elaboration on her anxiety-ridden allergic reaction is also possible, but no objective non-structural signs to support.

Day 2 just some fatigue. On day 3 started experiencing rash/hives and extreme itching all over body, especially throughout the night on 4th night.

This progressed to rigors and fevers (highest temperature measured 102.9 F), which continued through the night. The following day I felt weak. Within 48 hours, the worst of it was over, although I did have mild pain at the injection site for 2-3 days.

                                                The day of the vaccine not much trouble, the injection site was a little sore. As the evening came I started feeling the body aches, the chills. The next morning  I had a headache, I had joint pains (elbow, knee and hip). My arm pain was really severe. I could not even sleep on that side of my arm, the pain was excruciating.  I also noticed as I woke up that I also had hives, and it was red and hot and itching, blisters, all over my hand. I then contacted my PCP and they suggested Benadryl capsules. It took about a week for the rash to go away, I finally can wear my ring back (hands were very swollen). Now, I noticed I developed a cough about after a week after the vaccine. The rash is gone off my hands but the skin looks like it is peeling (reminds me of when a person has a real bad sunburn on skin and the burnt skin starts peeling off) from all the blistering and the rash on my hands. I did have COVID in late November, early December. I tested positive on 11/30/2020. The new skin that is being exposed is really tender and sore. I notice with each passing day skin feels better not so sensitive.  I get a little bit better each day, a little more energy each day.

A few hours later, I had a 101 fever, chills, stronger fatigue, strong headache, muscle aches. Around 6pm, I began vomiting continuously. I spoke with an advice nurse and she told me to go to the emergency room. I continued to vomit until about 11:30pm, I was weak and felt like passing out a few times. Later in the evening, I took a Tylenol and finally went to sleep. On April 2nd (day after shot), I woke up with fatigue and headache, but fever was gone and I no longer vomited. I took another Tylenol and headache went away.

Clinician did not use anything different when working on me. Itchy rash has remained now for 4 days and is about 50% resolved.

                                                Pain at the injection site shortly after the injection. Pain and tenderness in bicep began generally later the first day and lasted 2 weeks; I still have some bicep stiffness and tenderness today on Day 18. I had tenderness under the right armpit for about a week (assumed swollen lymph nodes).I had redness on the bicep below the injection site on Days 5-7. I also was tired on Day 2, 3, and 16 and took short naps. I experienced some muscle twitching in the bicep on Day 1, which still continues. On Day 6, I woke up with muscle twitching all over my body, randomly and intermittently. I was able to go about my day normally, but every few minutes something would twitch for a few seconds (my right arm, my left arm, my left knee, my right hip, my lower back, my left pointer finger, my left eyebrow, my diaphragm, etc). I drank a lot of fluids and took magnesium, zinc, D, B, C, omegas, turmeric, a multivitamin, and ate a banana for potassium on Day 6 and 7. Day 7 and 8, I only had muscle twitching in the right bicep again. Starting on Day 9 and continuing through the present, I continue to have intermittent twitches lasting a few seconds all over my body again. It is less frequent than on Day 6, but continues.

                                                Vaccine received at approximately 1:30pm.  Around 6pm, had noticeable chills, progressing to severe chills by 7pm.  Muscle aches and headache also began about that time.  Went to sleep.  Around 1:30 woke up with nausea and sweaty chills.  Walking to the bathroom was difficult due to extreme fatigue.  Fever measured at 103 degrees.  Took Tylenol.  Nausea resolved by 7am 4/10, but had no appetite. Fatigue throughout day (4/10) - slept most of the day.  As of 7am on 4/11, mostly better.  Remaining symptoms are a lingering headache, moderate fatigue, and vaccine site muscle soreness.  Perhaps some brain fog, as this form seems challenging and it shouldn&#39;t. Note:  I had had little sleep the week prior to the vaccine, which may have affected my reaction.

Around 6:00pm the same day I received vaccine, I started getting chills and strong aches in my back and legs. I felt very dizzy, lightheaded and sleepy. Chills were gone by the next morning, but aches and sleepiness continued for 4 days. Dizziness and lightheadedness continues til now. A little over a week after vaccination, I had random bruising on my legs on the same side I received vaccine. My lymph nodes were visibly swollen and my breasts felt extremely tender. Bruises are still healing, but lymph nodes and breasts seem relatively normal now, exactly 3 weeks after initial vaccination

Don&#39;t know about anything internally. I did feel the shot injected into my arm and it stung and I could feel it &#34;run down&#34; in the arm.   Outside the arm, the injection site seems to just be a tiny sore... nothing that is detracting for me.

Body aches came on again with significant chills.  Started vomiting about 2:00 am and had fever of 103.  Vomited about 3 times throughout the night and once more the next morning.  Continued to feel nausea and body aches all day Friday.  Threw up again on Saturday.  Started to feel better Sunday.  Much better Monday.  Arm swollen and red where shot was.

I had the usual arm soreness/tenderness right after the injection, which went away within a few days, so this was a later reaction that started with itching. Even 4 1/2 weeks later, it still itches from time to time, though the redness, swelling and heat are gone.

The remainder of the week she continued to experience mild discomfort, SOB, dizziness, heart palpitations, and lethargy.  At 2 to 3 days after injection, she did notice some swelling at the injection site.  She did not seek medical attention, but did message her physician.  She was told it was likely from the vaccine and to take some acetaminophen. No physical evaluation was performed on the patient.

Lasted approximately 4 hours. Extreme dizziness for approximately 2-3 minutes while sitting still at 4 hour mark - resolved with rest except arm pain, which lessened slightly over the first hour but remained unresolved after 4 hours.

Within first 3-4 hours had bad rash on arms, legs, face, neck and chest, fast heartrate, breathing and out of it sensation. I felt like I was having a partial analpylaxis reaction - like throat 1/2 closed but that I would be ok. I took Benadryl and used a Ventolin inhaler. Rash was better by 2nd day.  On 2nd and 3rd day I was having massive headache (felt like pressure from inside all over out to all cranial sutures), severe neck stiffness on rt side, lumbar vertebrate pain, iliosacral and hip pain, felt painful radiating spasms down my left and right legs, also jaw and teeth pain. Taking Naproxen and now ASA.  Very shakey and jittery. Occasionally have lower arm pain and numbness on left side. Also have injection site symptoms but minor compared to above. It&#39;s been 1 week and allergic part of rxn is over but concerned with possible neuro and bloodclot possibilties..  On day 2 or 3 I also had problems with my brain with reading comprahension.

                                                Right after the dose I got an immediate headache, dizzy and light headed. About an hour later I became nauseous and my face became very flush red and hot. I went to bed and woke up feeling like I got hit by a truck and was very tired with a sore arm. By the next day I was better. The following week I began with a red hot circle on my arm where the shot was given, it had a ring around it. That lasted for about a week. I then started to get stinging sensations in that part of my arm like I was being stung by a bee. These lasted for about 2 days. I then started getting muscle rolls/spasms in the same spot on that arm. They lasted about 3 days. I then started having pain in that arm like I had just gotten the shot and as I was rubbing it, I noticed a large indent in my arm. I went to the doctor, and they said they had no idea why it happened but if I get more symptoms to come back. The doc appt was on 4/12/21. It has been over a month of these side effects. Doctor not sure if it will be a permanent disfigure.

Those lasted until Sunday at 09:00. It just abruptly stopped. I woke up with rash all over my face and itchy and swollen eyes on Saturday and I went to the eye doctor on Saturday. I was given eye drops and and an anti-histamine; That is helping. I am still a little bit itchy on my face but it&#39;s better.

Today the red spots look smaller but I have bruises on both of my legs lower and upper sections (I been working in the garden so I might have bumped into things perhaps) I thought I just report this symptoms so you can add data to your system.

                                                Immediately after injection. I felt a heat go from my head to toes and down my arms into my hands. My lower legs, feet, hands, left arm and chest begin to tingle. After sitting a few minutes it did not get worse. The tingling is not constant now, but I am still having it. Seems like I have it in the left arm more often than anywhere else.  Within 20 minutes of the shot I began having gastrointestinal issues., that progressed.  It built into strong chest pressure, acid reflux and indigestion. I got into the Dr on March 25. He prescribed Nexium. I am now having significant hair loss and have started having heart palpitations. I am waiting on his response as to what tests are needed to proceed.

A hard, painful, marble-sized lump appeared at the injection site. The lump didn&#39;t start to recede until two weeks later. The lump is smaller; however, still present and painful after almost four weeks.

We were 5 hrs from home, on a weekend, could not get vaccines in our county. Drove to  County. After the 15 min when walking out of the building noticed strong metallic taste in mouth (no fillings), thought odd. Then while driving noticed red blemishes/rash on neck, swelling of my tongue. Once arrived at hotel (too far to drive back home and not feeling well), noticed red rash on front of neck, ear lobes bright red, hot to the touch and swollen. Vertigo and low fever came on along with elevated heart rate. These lasted all Saturday into Sunday. Didn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t sleep Saturday night, Sunday morning rash on face with heart rate BPM elevated all day with fever and bad vertigo. All these symptoms continued all week with exception to the rash and swollen tongue those subsided late Sunday. The vertigo, fevers, skin sensitivity and complete fatigue along with bump at injection site persisted even to today.

Reports very sharp and  profound pain,  &#34;felt exactly as it did when I first got the injection&#34;  The pain took a couple days to resolve.  Today 4 weeks later she reports still having  some swelling/soft tissue lump at the injection site.  Negative for redness, warmth.  She did not seek medical care or call the clinic to report adverse events.  She attempted to file a VAERS report but was unsuccessful as she did not have her vaccine lot number.

                                                She got her vaccine, she felt the burning sensation all the way down to her fingers and her wrist.  I proceeded to go forward and wait the 15 minutes.  She then started to have pain in the side of her neck on the right side, discomfort and pain in her arm.  Within the hour she started to have headaches (has had COVID in the past).  She went home and it was a nagging pain in her arm, not at the site but the whole arm was sore and limited using the arm due to the discomfort.  That night is when she came on the news and started that the vaccine was being pulled from administration.  That night it was like a pulling sensation right in her upper arm, up near the armpit and the fatty tissue from the breast and where you raise your arm.  When she started noticing the discoloration started in her skin.  Her hands started getting black, under both arms were black, the back of her legs was black, and she started feeling worsening fatigue.  She started getting worried and was looking at how her veins turned purple blue/green just in the one arm.  She was trying to figure out why she had limited use of her arm, and was holding it as if she had a sling on it as when it hung to her side it had the pulling sensation and a crawling sensation in her veins (that night and going into the next day).  The next morning she was so exhausted and tired, as was her mother who had the vaccine at the same time, and was not feeling well.  She was feeling that possibly due to the fibromyalgia she was have worsening symptoms than her mother.  She then started bruises on her body, on the arm itself as if somebody grabbed and squeezed her arm, purplish/black bruising.  It had her forearm develop 3 large pockets of swollen, almost as if the medicine was sitting in her arm.   She was slowly getting the pulling sensation down to her hand, and she called the UC first and due to the high volume of COVID she wanted to know how long of a wait she would have.  They instructed her to go to the ER due to the development of the blood clots on the news.  There was no change in her symptoms, and got to the point that she could not move her arm, and the knots stayed in there and there was a reddish discoloration around them.  Now she was having a pulling sensation in her chest and palpitations of pain near her heart.  She was having soreness in her legs to the point that she was not able to walk, and felt it was in her nerves 3 days after the vaccine.  She stayed in the bed the entire week just due to the exhaustion and effects.   Every time she would go to reach for something she would have the pulling sensation down to her hand, and the entire arm was swollen with the bruising all over.  Her body started having purple and blue knots and also in the left leg.  Her arm and fingers were swollen as well.  She then started having itching of her arm, and her lips started swelling and got up and went to Hospital and was able to be seen.  She was having problems with her stomach as well, having a knot in the stomach where it was protruding and started loosing weight since the vaccine.    The ER doctor told her she had a reaction to the vaccine, and did a Doppler to see if she had blood clots.  They did not give her the results and didn&#39;t feel that she didn&#39;t have problems.  She also went to the UC and back and forth to the ER, and still had the knots and finally looked at the knots and her jaw was swollen, and her arm was still swollen.  The UC told her that she was having a fibromyalgia flare.  She is still having the same symptoms green/blue and have started protruding.   Due to the fatigue she has mainly just stayed in bed and knew that she was to have COVID symptoms, but knows that the crawling sensation and the knots sitting in her arm, and now her arm looks disfigured and the swelling is not going down.  They told her that the test was negative for the blood clots.  She had made an appointment with her neurologist and has an APT on Tuesday 5/25/21.   She continues to loose weight no matter how much she consumes and still continues to have the knots and pain in the arm.

                                                A swollen lymph node on right ear - hard painful knot - felt like a bruise - it kept swelling after a few days. I went to the doctor - I saw a Dr - as mine was on vacation. They gave me amoxicillin and through taking that it went away. It&#39;s completely gone away. It doesn&#39;t hurt to poke at it anymore.

On March 20, 2021 I woke up with swollen lips and face, and hives on my arms, legs and trunk. I also had a cough, watery eyes and itchy throat, like typical allergy symptoms. I went to the emergency room and was treated for an allergic reaction. No one, including myself, considered the COVID shot as the reason. The hives were gone within 24 hours, but the other allergy symptoms lasted for one week exactly. They had not gotten any better with a variety of over the counter allergy medications. When I  went to my primary doctor for a follow up visit on March 29th  all of the symptoms were gone. They were the ones that recommended I sign up with the vaers system, and they suggested the possible/likely connection to the vaccine.

By next morning, 6/11/21 mild petechiae noticed down both forearms.  Since vaccination information recommended seeking immediate attention, I went to Hospital ER. Dr. was the physician who saw me.  Labs were completed and all returned within normal limits.  I was discharged and advised to follow up for repeat labs with my PCP on 6/15/21.  On 6/15/21 I met with my PCP, Dr., who repeated the same labs that were done at Hospital.  Not all results are back, but so far the results that have returned are still within normal limits and relevant values do not appear to be decreasing significantly.  I called Jahnssen, and they were unable to advise if I should get labs repeated again in the coming weeks to ensure I am not having an issue with Vaccine-induced Thrombocytopenia.  My PCP and the ER physician do not know what to advise either given the newness of these side effects.  I have noted Petechia (mild) on my torso and thighs, so seems to be progressing down my body or becoming more noticeable.

                                                Around the first week of May I was experiencing a stuffy nose. Around the middle of May I felt like it had moved to my throat and something was gagging me. I went to Urgent Care and they tested me for strep. They gave me steroids and a Z-pack. The steroid was injectable. The next morning you feeling okay, but in the evening I went back to Urgent Care because it felt bad again. They gave me 3 more days of prednisone, 20 mg per day. One week later I went to my GP. There was a rash on my neck and my doctor gave me 10 days of Bactrim. On the last day of the medicine, I developed a painful sinus headache. I went back to see my GP 2 days later and they treated me for the sinus pressure/headache. They gave me a prescription for 5 days of another antibiotic. I went back a week later and they stopped giving me antibiotics because it had been 20 days. They told me to get over the counter nose spray and told me to clean my nose with saline. Last week I went to an ENT. They told me to continue with the saline and the nose spray.

                                                About six or seven hours after the shot I started to feel bad, first some in my chest, then a scratchy throat with swollen glands, then mild body aches.   The next day the sore throat was gone, and body aches got worse. All my joints ache. I felt chilled in spite of outdoor temperature of 79, and a hot bath, blankets and sitting in front of a fire. It was 74 inside the house. I started to get a bit of a headache but it never developed into a full headache. At about 6pm (day 2) I started to get  hot. Anything touching my skin bothered me.   At about 7pm (day 2) I took two Tylenol and the symptoms improved by about  8:30pm.

Next morning fever, fatigue, deep muscle pain across back of shoulders concentrated at base of neck, headache, ringing in ears.  Later that night, severe sudden muscle spasms on left side of lower back....spun me around and doubled me over...left me feeling a little breathless.  Next morning (day 3), still some deep muscle pain now dispersed across back,. Less burning at injection site, fever but less, coughing up some clear glen from lungs....breathing ok though, still fatigued.

I then went to sleep and on Saturday morning when I woke up my right wrist was itching a lot as well as  my legs, buttocks and hands. All over my body was red and very itchy. I did not sleep due to the itchiness on Saturday night. I developed little red bumps on my entire body. I ate lentils for food but I do not think it was the food. I went to urgent care and saw a doctor who gave me Benadryl, took one dose and then it slowly started to go away.

I woke at 5:30 the next morning with a fever of 99.9 F, a headache, chills and body aches.  These symptoms continued throughout the day and were alleviated somewhat by tylenol.  I slept a large part of the day and felt better when I woke the next day, Monday.  On Monday I felt mostly normal but still had some body aches including a back ache on my left side.  I also had more injection site pain and a red rash about a half dollar in size that was tender to touch and by night time was itchy.

                                                Vaccination was 10:30 am.  Around 6:30 pm, my right knee started to throb.  I took an epsom salt bath, where my upper back started to hurt.  I went to sleep around 8:00.  I woke up around 10 pm unable to open my eyes all the way.  I believe they were swollen nearly shut.  I could see a slit of light coming in from outside.  I couldn&#39;t move my left hand at all (left arm is where I received vaccination).  I held it up to the outside light, and it was swollen.  The light coming in from outside hurt my eyes.  I couldn&#39;t see enough to call for help.  Around 1:30 a.m., the swelling went down enough for me to open my eyes.  I have never seen them look so bloodshot.  It was scary.  I could move my hand again as well.  I spent next day in bed resting.   Monday, I noticed a small rash on my right shoulder.  I went to work and was there about 20 minutes before I started feeling hot and dizzy.  I went home and spent the day in bed.   I was able to go to work the next day, Tuesday, without problem.  One week after vaccination, the rash on my shoulder went away, but a small rash broke out on my right shin.  This one was deeper.  One week later, there are just a couple of small scabs left in the spot on my shin.  I feel my energy level is close to normal.

                                                Received vaccine at 10am - 20 mins later felt slight prickly itching in both arms between armpit and elbow. Lasted about 10 minutes. Around 4pm the same day I had bad neck pain. And pounding heading, about 1 hour later starting getting chills and fatigued. By 10pm had body aches and muscles pains. I took some Motrin and went to bed. I couldn?t sleep as my mind kept racing. In the morning (day after vaccine) I was feeling worse. All symptoms continued in full force and I couldn?t get out of bed. 10am I was able to drink some Alka seltzer cold medicine and lay back down. I continued to have chills pounding headache bodyaches muscle aches and sweating, but no fever. I felt like I had a bad case of the flu. I?ve continued taking 600 mg Motrin every eight hours and this has helped with the pains and bodyaches. Day 3 woke up feeling much better, noticed a funny smell in my nose, I haven?t been blowing my nose or had any mucus, but I can?t explain the smell. I still have body aches and muscles pains.

                                                Slight pain and swelling at injection site.  Body ache and slight nausea and exhaustion.  Worth noting that I was so excited about getting the vaccination that I could not sleep the night before.  I blame the exhaustion and later headache on lack of sleep, food, and caffeine.  I went to bed early and took acetaminophen and slept well.  In the morning a shower, coffee and breakfast and more acetaminophen makes me almost as good as new.

Was prescribed medication and with prednisone, after 3 days was finally able to get the hives under control.

( I am not prone to headaches,  just mild sinus discomfort or slight hangover from alcohol)    This headache was much worse.  Arm pain increased as time progressed and spread farther in arm and even neck and lasted for 5 days.   I felt tired for about 5 days.  I had some mild headaches more than normal after the five days and until present.  Added note.  I don?t get sick often.  I worked as a flight attendant for 28 years and exposed to lots of whatever.  I don?t get sick with more than a little cough or something but never miss work.  I felt pretty bad for 5 days after this vaccine.

                                                Immediately after injection, my heart raced, I got a metallic taste in my mouth, and my fingers got cold and tingly. The next day, I developed chest pain, racing heart, shortness of breath, and insomnia. I continue to have chest pain. On 04/08/2021, without injury or anything that I did, my right middle finger swelled and turned purple and it&#39;s still purple. The ER doctor said it was a hematoma.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine  During the injection I had extreme pain in my left arm at the injection site.  This lasted for about 1 hour and then calmed down to a dull ache.    About 7 pm Wednesday night (April 7) I started a low grade fever of 99.6 degrees.  Over the next three hours it increased to 102 degrees.  It stayed this high for about five hours.  (During this time I also experienced severe, almost uncontrollable shivering.)  Then it slowly dropped back down to 100 degrees by about 5 am.  It remained there for about 12 hours.  Then at about 5 pm it dropped to about 99.6 degrees where it stayed until I went to bed at 10 pm.  When I woke up at 2:30 am Friday morning I was covered in sweat and the fever was gone.    In addition to the fever, I had a moderate to severe headache, extreme body aches and Joint pain, as well as exhaustion.  As the fever diminished, these symptoms did as well.    By Friday afternoon all I had was some body aches and joint pain along with a minor headache.    By Saturday I was fully recovered other than some minor discomfort at the injection site.

Within an hour the right side of my face and ear started to hurt, almost like it felt burnt, The nerve endings was super sensitive and has still not gone away. That night I didn&#39;t feel good, tired and out of it. On the third day I woke up with a rash on various parts of my body and moved to my eye lids as well. I called for a telehealth, and asked for a low dose steroid and he said not because I would &#34;disrupt my immune response&#34;.  I&#39;m still having issues.

I headed home around 4 pm and started to feel warm, but thought it was the sun. Around 5:15 I got the chills, very bad. So bad my jaws were shaking. I tried to use a heating blanket to get warm, but was very miserable. About an hour later I started running a fever that kept going up. My ears started to hurt and the ringing was really bad. By 8:30 my fever had spiked to 102 and I was so nauseous I had a hard time moving around, I almost used the bathroom on myself twice. Started burning up but still unable to move, I went outside to cool down and had a family member take me to the urgent care. They said my arm was swollen from the injection site and that everything was normal and that it was a good thing I was having these experiences because it means the vaccine was working.  Gave me nausea medicine and aspirin and sent me home. I was unable to sleep from all the pain in my body and just laid here in pain starting to get really hot. Woke up around 4 soaking wet where I broke the fever and then continued to have a mild fever all day Sunday, April 11, with mild sweats on and off when my body would get too hot. Today just been trying to move around but very tired and exhausted. Had hard time sitting up to do some work at the table, so been laying down most of the day.

                                                Almost immediately (remember noticing the next day after my vaccine shot), a very hard big lump started forming about an inch lower than where the injection needle went in (it was definitely about an inch down from where my band-aid was).  The lump got bigger and harder over the last week and seemed to spread out into like a sideways egg shape.  My skin there almost looked like a light purple bruise in the shape of a sideways egg.  It has gone down now in the last couple of days, but there is still a hard nugget of lump there.  It has me concerned like it could be a blood clot or something.

                                                Less than 12 hours after the vaccination I woke up at 1 a.m. with severe chills and body aches, a 102 fever and terrible headache.  The worst of this lasted 5 or 6 hours and slowly improved, although I could not get back to sleep. I was out of commission for the entire day.   At 6 p.m that evening my temperature was still at 100 degrees and the headache remained.  The following day, April 8th, I did feel better. I was still fatigued and only then did I notice any pain/sensitivity at the injection site (I think the body aches masked anything less severe). This pain was to be expected and nothing out of the ordinary. I am fine now. I was taken aback at the severity of the adverse reaction.  Also, my 20-year-old son got the shot at the same place -- with the same Lot Number 043A21A -- and had exactly the same reactions as I did. (They even started one hour after mine -- the same amount of time our injections were spaced out).    (He may not be reporting it.  Being only 20, he&#39;s not as thorough with these things although I will try to get him to do so).

I woke about 11-12pm with my surgical sight burning and hot pain. I took my pain medication but it didn&#39;t touch it. After about 3-4 hours in which I took another pain pill, a muscle relaxant and a sleep pill, the pain and burning subsided. The site was then sore along with my left arm where I received the site. Today 4/13/2021 is the first day I feel good.

                                                Day of vaccine:  within a few hours of receiving the vaccine (around 12:00pm or 1:00pm), I developed a headache, body aches, pain at the injection site, and brain fog.  The brain fog was such that I could no longer work, so I laid down.  Late in the afternoon (around 4:00pm), I developed numbness and tingling in my finder tips.  This continued to get worse, particularly when walking around, so I continued to rest.  Around 9:00pm, I was also getting dizzy when walking.  I went to bed, and awoke symptom-free in the morning.  Treatment included bed rest, ibuprofen, applied heat, and increased fluid intake.  Day after vaccine: I had the first HSV-2 outbreak I&#39;ve had in 5 years.

Took screenshot selfie of face with phone. 10-13 days after shot- gums felt inflamed near base. On day 13 went to dentist and he said looked like an allergic reaction/irritation, not gingivitis, as not above teeth but near roof of mouth. Speculated could have reaction to shot in combination with toothpaste. (Evening of shot had chills/ache/low grade fever/head pains/nausea/diarrhea next morning. Took over the counter Tylenol).

                                                Had shot on Monday.  Horrible pain in arm at injection site that went up my neck to my head.  Sinuses flared up and ears started beeping.  Became dizzy and nauseous and had difficultly breathing.  Went to pass out due to blood pressure drop.  Had to breath in alcohol wipes and then both arms went into pain as if falling asleep only 100 times worse.  Could not moves my arms - hands were cramping.  Took 1 hour to get back to some normal to drive home. The next day/Tues my sinuses where still a little swollen along with a little bit of arm pain, nausea and fatigue.   Wed - Fri sinuses continued to be swollen then on Fri - Sun had coughing.  Following Mon was weaker and feeling low immune.  Tues ended up at doctor&#39;s office having gone into a sinus infection.  Was also experiencing shallow breathing in neck and chest.  Started Augmentin 875mg 2 x a day Tues - Fri.  Then Fri night went into a severe inflammation in my chest, throat and esophagus with difficulty to catch my breath and couldn&#39;t eat.  Sat reached out to document through EMR and was prescribed a Steroid (6 days) which I started on Sun morning.  Was very weak and took that whole week with full does of steroid to get back to normal breathing.  Finished Antibiotics (12 days worth) 2 days after completing the steroid which was now Sunday.  Then still had some sinus recovery where ear was beeping in and out for 2 more days.  By Wed of the 4th week things were returning to normal.  Total time to recover was exactly 4 weeks.

                                                The second night after the shot I was awakened out of a sound sleep at 3AM  with a pain across the entire top of my upper chest (at the top of the breast region) it was a though someone had turned a 2x4 on its side and was standing on it.  I was clammy and had some hives on my back and hips. I sat on the side of the bed I stretched my arms did some yoga type moves trying to see if being less active the day after the shot maybe had my back a little tight causing the pain.  I chewed two tums thinking that might help to get rid of the pain even though I knew it was worse than heartburn. After 15 mins at 3:15 I woke my husband to let him know it was not going away and that I was not sure what was going on but just in case I did not want to be ridiculous and sit there and have a heart attack. I&#39;m not one to run to the doctor, I&#39;m very healthy but thought to myself this may be more serious.  My husband ask about calling for help and I said lets just see what happens and just know if I need help then you at least know my symptoms now . I woke the next morning and felt much better and made a joke about all the crazy people being right stating &#34;they are trying to kill us&#34;  Later in the week on Thursday playing tennis I felt me left arm going numb, I shrugged it off to hitting the ball hard and it never crossed my mind about anything else. Two weeks to the day on Sunday Morning I woke with a migraine that made me feel I was going to throw up.   The news just came out about J&amp; J and the few family members that knew about my adverse reaction urged me to report and go to the Dr.   I&#39;m currently dealing with a bruise (I usually don&#39;t bruise badly) on my left front chin- I could have hit it on something who knows but it has been there now over a week.

                                                Started having what I thought was injection site pain within a day or two after injection.  Pain increased over time along with other symptoms such as fatigue, increased body odor, general malaise, headaches. Because of persistence of symptoms, visited my primary care provider on March 29 and she referred me for an MRI which was performed on April 2. On April 7 saw an orthopedist who said the MRI showed synovitis in my left shoulder and referred me to a rheumatologist and prescribed Meloxicam for the pain.  I met with the rheumatologist on April 23 and he prescribed tests and a course of steroids. My follow up appointment was today (May 12) and he said I have signs of Sjogrens and am HLA B27 positive. Perhaps a predisposition to autoimmune response trigged by vaccine.

More than a month later, I still have a lump in my arm, it has descended about an inch or two from the initial injection but when any pressure is applied the lump still aches and I experience tingling through my arm initially, then continued pain near the lump for several minutes after the pressure has been stopped.

After 30 minutes the swelling had reduced some so the patient was told to ice again in a few hours and dose with diphenhydramine again if swelling continued.

                                                Soreness in my left arm at the injection site area. I treated with ibuprofen. It was fine the next day - used a lot of motion to help. I rubbed it and I guess I wasn&#39;t suppose to. I had no other issues until my typical seasonal allergies but a week an a half later - Saturday, I noticed I was having symptoms and was notified by a family member, that family member on Tuesday after I started having symptoms that they had a positive test. So I got tested at a Rapid Test site. I had productive cough and sinus congestion and some chest pain and shortness of breath. That went on for about a week and a half. I contacted my physician after the positive COVID test and because I have asthma related to the Hiatal hernia - and I increased to maximum dosage on Advair. That worked. Mucinex with Sudafed to dry that out. And started to use Cool Mist Humidifier and had that in my room constantly and I did self isolate to my bedroom during that time.  Vicks vapor rub on my chest. I wasn&#39;t running a fever - it varied slightly but it never went over 99. My highest temperature I think was 98. I monitored my O2 with finger monitor - as I had shortness of breath doing stairs. Lowest around 88 but then it would return to 96 or 97 in about 15 minutes.  Follow up with doctor (primary care doctor) - telemed appt.

                                                Later that day I had the worse headache ever. It was the number 2 worst headache I&#39;ve ever experienced. The headache lasted about a week and a half but it wasn&#39;t as intense as it was initially. It gradually got lessened but it was constant and persistent. I had a pain and pressure at my fore head and my eyes hurt as in the muscle of my eye. I also had pain in the injection site with  muscle soreness but that went away quickly. The itchiness was different than other vaccines and lasted for about a day. I also started to get congestion in my sinuses and my ears. I also experienced pain when trying to swallow. That lasted about 3 days. It felt like my glands were swollen. The combination of the headache and the ear pain and sinus pressure made me unable to work. Up until that point I was taking ibuprofen to manage the pain and maybe 1 or 2 doses of Benadryll which is what I usually take when I get allergy symptoms like itchy throat. It did not work, I contacted the doctor who said I had a sinus infection. I went to the doctor on 04/22/2021 and received antibiotics (amoxicillin) which lasted 10 days. Around this time, I developed a cough which is still present. The antibiotics did not help, the doctor then gave me steroids on 5/12/2021. They do not seem to be helping. I also took Aleve sinus medicine as well. The cough worsened and I lost my voice around 05/12/2021. My doctor said it was drainage that was causing my cough.

                                                After I received the vaccine I felt like I was going to have a panic attack while I was waiting in the chair. My anxieties were already high going in to take the vaccine because I was worried. The next day I started feeling very fatigued, but I kept jumping awake because of the anxiety. I took my temperature and it was between 99-100 degrees. I had a little itchy skin rash, but I&#39;m not sure if it was due to my anxiety. I felt that my anxiety was much higher than normal. The following week I developed stomach issues. I requested that my doctor cut down my metformin mg. My stomach issues went away, so I increased my metformin again. I started feeling better after week 3. I cut back down to 500mg again and started taking a probiotic again. I am starting to feel like I&#39;m having flu like symptoms this week.

These symptoms lasted approximately 36 hours.  On the third day after the shot (05/24/2021), my left arm started hurting and was red, inflamed, hard, and swollen at injection site.  The area affected was about the size of my right hand.  Days later, (as of 06/04/2021), I still have a finger sized lump at the injection site.

                                                This is a summary and time line of the issues that I have had since my vaccine on April 1, 2021.  No matter what my pain level was, I always moved and stretched my arm through the pain. I felt that if I stopped moving it, the pain and range of motion would get worse.   April 1: received J&amp;J shot. Shot was administered by an MD. The needle made a squirting noise at the end when he pulled it out. Later at night my arm became sore. I could not sleep on it. The pain was internal ? there was no soreness to the exterior touch and no redness. I?ll note here that the injection site NEVER hurt to be touched from the outside, there has never been any injection site soreness to the touch or bumps or redness. The injection site was high up on my arm and to the side.  April 2: range of motion limited. Extremely painful to move (symptoms are like Rotator cuff injury).  Cannot sleep on it.   April 3: same as day before. I called the on call doc. She called me back. She asked some questions about the symptoms. She said she got a COVID vaccine and her arm was super sore too could sleep on it etc., worst arm pain she?s ever had. She also asked me what symptoms I was having and to call back the next day if there was no improvement.   April 4: I didn?t call the doctor again as there seemed to be improvement. Range of motion not great but a little better. Hurts a little less. Can?t sleep on it.   April 5 ? 8: small improvements but still limited range of motion and pain. Twinges here and there and also when arm moved a certain way it pops.  (the ?pop? is in the shoulder - I have never had this prior to shot and pain).  April 9:  woke up to arm being way worse.  A relapse.  Limited range of motion.  Can lift above head but hurts a lot. Taking off shirts/clothing hurts. Cannot sleep on it or on my back without pain. Cannot sleep most of the night.  April 10 -11:  same  April 12: same as above.  Called doctor. Confirms it shouldn?t be this way. Warm compresses.  Ibuprofen. Says if not better can come in for ultrasound. I say I may just go to orthopedic doctor ? saves some steps.  April 13: same as above. I made an appointment with the orthopedic doctor for May 5th.   April 13-28. basically the same as above. There has been little to no improvement and perhaps shoulder is more stiff in some ways (i.e. lifting it to my head difficult).  Range of motion is limited.  Cannot put on or take off clothes without pain.  Arm is very weak and I cannot push myself off the bed or couch with the arm.  Cannot sleep on back have to lie on opposite side and prop arm up on pillow. Doesn?t stay comfortable.  Try to lie on back. Cannot lie this way for long.  Up most of the night.  All through night and morning arm is hard to lift and feels like there?s 50 pounds of weight on it.  Harder to lift forward than up or to back.  Shoulder ?pops? on occasion.  April 29-30:  all symptoms are the same as above, but it feels like that this a tiny bit of improvement.  I cannot lift my arm ?normally? to itch my head. It feels like there is heavy weight on it.  The arm is very weak compared to my other arm and there is a lot of pain when I use it for most tasks.  The pain is in the shoulder. The ?popping? in the shoulder continues.  May 5th ? Appointment with orthopedic doctor. X-rays.  Prescribed physical therapy for 4-6 weeks and if I am not better then perhaps an MRI.  May 5-19 ? I have had two weeks of physical therapy (six sessions). Pain keeps me up nightly and I do not have full range of motion without pain. Range of motion improving slowly.   May 20-June 7 ? Another 8 sessions of physical therapy. Based upon discussions about my pain and progress made, I have been told that I probably saved myself from frozen shoulder by moving it constantly since getting injured (before PT). I have had improvements in how I move my arm, but certain movements still create a lot of pain for me. For instance, I can lift my shirt off with ?some? pain, but it?s much worse if I have use any sort of exertion or use my muscle to pull on the shirt. I also cannot move my arm suddenly or fast without causing pain. At night the pain no longer wakes me up, but when I wake up on my own and have to shift and pull on the covers, I can barely pull them on and my arm pops or ?tweaks?.  Then it hurts the rest of the night and I tend to wake up sore in the morning.  It?s difficult to exactly describe the pain without visually showing movements, etc.   The PT office has projected 5 more sessions (and at home stretching) ending 6/25/21, but they will be assessing my progress.  At that point it will be determined if an MRI should be obtained.  I believe that on April 1 - the needle was placed too high up on my shoulder (in fact when I first looked at the band aid I couldn?t believe how high and to the side it was). It was NOT in the area when the needle should go. I believe that my neck degeneration and my shoulder issues are NOT related.  I believe that if the needle had been placed properly that I would not be in this situation today.

It was swollen and very painful that I could not move my arm to do my daily activities. I went to the doctor and she said that it was nothing serious and she did not do any tests but she gave me some exercises to do at home and I still have some pain but not as bad as in the beginning. She gave me some medications for the pain and swelling.

                                                I started with getting red, hard knots in my leg. They were hard, hard knots. Almost felt like  blood clot. My blood pressure rose extremely high like never before. Then I got edema. I went to the vein doctor. I saw the nurse assistant and they said it wasn&#39;t a blood clot. Finally, I got to see him at another visit and he thought it was bug bites. But it sounded odd like that I would have these red splotches up and down my legs and they were hard and he put me on Prednisone. The symptoms disappeared completely. About 4 -6 days after the medication was over, all the symptoms re-appeared. At some point, I went to the ER - because I was worried about blood clots. They gave me Cephlex - as they thought it was bug bites  - so I was on that for 6 or 7 days. And the symptoms got better with this medication - made it better but not disappear like Prednisone did. Then after that, it was horrible again - the symptoms. I have an appt tomorrow to get checked again. I have never have had this stuff before in my life. My blood pressure is elevated but not so high as it was in the beginning. My legs are in pain - I can&#39;t even touch them. My skin so red  - it looks like it&#39;s on fire. I went to Orthopedic doctor thinking it was related to a previous injury or sprain. But they said it wasn&#39;t related to that at all .The skin so tight gets so tight and sore that I can barely walk. The skin is broken like it&#39;s thin and very fragile. My left leg is  significantly worse than the right leg in the calf area (it&#39;s two times the size as the right calf).  Still have edema I can&#39;t hardly wear shoes. At the end of the day, it&#39;s worse, but still in the morning now they are still swollen.

Thirdly, I have an odd peanut size bump on my left hand middle finger right under the nail that is squishy.

                                                Given the Janssen covid-19 Vaccine EUA at pharmacy.  Left arm swelled right away and I lost around  3 tablespoons of blood from the vaccine site.  I am concerned that the vaccine came out of the arm with the blood.  I was asked to wait 30 min before going home.  The bleeding stopped after 30 seconds.  Swelling went down over next hour.  No other side effects.  I am concerned that I may not be vaccinated if the vaccine came out of the arm with the blood.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  Approximately 7 hours after the shot, my body was in a continuous state of needing to stretch. It is like when you wake up in the morning and need to stretch - a whole body stretch- but this was continuous. Over and over and over, right after each other. It went on for many hours. Also, 40 hours after the shot, I noticed a body rash (it could have been there the previous day but I was in bed all day feeling horrible and didn&#39;t notice). I also have a rash on my sacrum area, and I could barely walk with the pain in my bones in that area. As the morning has progressed, I am feeling better in that area but it is still sore. It has been 40 hours after my vaccine and I am still not 100%. Aside from the horrible headache, chills and flu-like symptoms, these are the other side effects I thought need to be reported.

No treatments yet....but if still bad after this weekend, will seek medical help.  Left eye swelling started at 2pm today, with pain. the eye lid and the area around the left eye are painful and swollen. I have been using hot compresses.  Difficulty catching my breath today durning a morning walk. I have been walking for months on the same path and can hold a conversation, but today, I could barely walk and talk. Once I stopped talking I eventually was able to catch my breath, but we had to walk a much slower pace as well.

The site was sore, the client describing it as &#34;it feels like there is a lot of pressure where the vaccine went in&#34;.  No other symptoms occurred. After 30 minutes of observation there was some faint bruising at the bottom of the swelling.

The EMT&#39;s were called, my blood pressure was really low, but as I sat up for a while it got better and I was able to go home. The next day my arm was really sore, I took too ibuprofen twice that day which helped. The next morning I woke up with hives all over my upper body that&#39;s itchy.

                                                Had initial onset of arm pain (generalized) and injection site soreness within 12 hours. Over 3-5 days, the acute symptoms gradually cleared. However, a localized, subcutaneous swelling (a &#34;knot&#34;) remains at the time of this report which is day 12. The &#34;knot&#34; is slightly painful when rubbed; has not seemed to decrease in size.  It is questioned if the injection needle placement might be a factor, since the same size needle is used for my tiny, skinny arm (I am Asian, 100 lbs) as is used for my caucasian husband whose arm is 3 times the size as mine.

                                                3/29/2021- received vaccine around 12:15pm  Within 3 hours, I was extremely &#34;hyper&#34;  My husband noticed that my entire left arm (which received the shot) was a different color than my entire right arm.  I did not sleep at all Monday night. 3/30/2021- felt fine until about 1:00pm when I noticed body aches.  It worsened from then until bedtime.  My hands, feet, and back hurt the worst.  I asked my husband to rub my back, and he gasped when I lifted my shirt.  My entire midback area was covered in a bright red, raised rash with blisters. I took Benadryl and applied betamethasone prescription cream (which I use for poison ivy or bug bites).  My hands also itched, so I used the cream on my hands as well. I was sweating profusely but freezing.  Took my temperature several times but it was never over 98.  I could not sleep well, awake for an hour, asleep for 5 minutes off and on all night. 3/31/2021- I notified my primary care physician of the allergic reaction via the patient portal.  His reply was to take Benadryl, which I was already doing every couple hours.  The itchy back rash remained and more blisters formed.  By the time I finished working, the redness was gone but the blisters remained.  Itching stopped.  Body aches were lessening. 4/1/2021- Rash completely gone, itching completely gone.  Feeling lethargic (possibly due to lack of sleep, but maybe from the vaccine).  One large blister (size of a quarter) and several smaller blisters remain. 4/2/2021- as of now, my left arm is still a bit sore when I raise it over my head.  Main concern is the huge blister that is still on my back.

                                                Very painful injection! I felt this going in immediately. Probably 30 minutes after I also felt a little dizzy but I also have a chronic condition called vestibular migraine. I was fatigued later in the evening. Had full day on day after vax  because I already had things on my calendar but was dragging by the time I got home. Aches all over especially joints, head and injection site was warm to touch and somewhat swollen. Also started running fever one day after. Highest temp 101.9 . I also started having diarrhea, full on three days after. My taste and smell had been off since having covid in august, but I swear they are since taking vax. Today is Tuesday so I&#39;m now five days in and temps normal today. My body aches are also improved but my head is still a bit achy.

                                                4/6/21 I awoke with symptoms of numbness/paralysis on left side of face limited to  upper lip and cheek area and both eyes would not stop watering. Movements to drink or make facial expressions were limited due to the numbness.  Because I have sensitive skin  I thought I may have had some type of reaction to something. So I waited to see if it would clear up through the day. I was not experiencing any other symptoms. By that evening it was apparent that I was not getting better and possibly getting worse because I began to experience some noticeable drooping in my cheek area. I decided to call my doctor in the morning. Because I am currently out of town, my home doctor suggested I see a local ER to rule out a stroke and determine if I was experiencing Bell&#39;s Palsy. I went to an ER clinic on 4/7/21

Continued to experience palpitations, dizziness and nausea throughout the afternoon. Within 2 hours, headache and extreme fatigue started and are still present 5 days later. Also experienced shortness of breath, worsening of asthma symptoms and lightheadedness. Woke up on the 5th morning with delayed reaction at injection site. No visible rash or bruise at this time, but hard lump at site and entire upper arm feels very bruised and sore to the point that it hurts to lift the arm. Ibuprofen is all I have taken for it. Will see a doctor if not improved in the next two days.

                                                Muscle aches started about 12 hours after the injection.  First my legs and back but after another 12 hours it was mostly my legs.  Legs felt like the muscles were being pulled.  (It felt like the beginnings of the extreme reaction I had to ampicillin 2 decades earlier, though not nearly as severe.)  My arm swelled slightly, was warm at the injection site and ached about 12 hrs after the injection.  The leg aches lasted about 2 days, the arm ache lasted about 1 day and the slight arm swelling lasted about 6 days... Reason for my reporting:  I had an annual eye exam 4/14/21 where a retinal scan was done.  The optometrist saw some blood spots in my left eye and referred me to an ophthalmologist.  Ophthalmologist performed additional scans and tests including a Fluroescein angiography and determined I have BRVO (Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion) which is a series of blot clots in small vessels of the eye&#39;s main vein.  He did not say it could be a result of the vaccine but I have no risk factors associated with getting BRVO.  Since it is not affecting my vision yet, the doctor wants to monitor it in 3 months to make sure it has not worsened.  Since the Janssen vaccine was put on hold for causing other types of blot clots in women in my age group, I am wondering if the vaccine caused the blood clots in my eye.

That was all expected.  Exactly one week later I had nausea, vomiting and diarrhea that lasted about 24 hours. For 24 hours after that I had a decreased appetite, and then after that I was fine.  Not sure if this was related to the vaccine but wanted to report it just in case.

                                                Patient received the COVID vaccine in the RA and immediately complained of the pain and stated she felt dizzy, faint, and lightheaded. She said she thought the needle was still in the arm until she felt the bandaid go on and realized it wasn&#39;t. She said she felt nauseous, and slouched down in her seat. I went to get a trash can just in case she got sick and she immediately got out of the chair and said she needed to lie down on the floor. We placed her on the pharmacy floor and she said she was having a hard time breathing and her head &#34;felt funny and weird&#34;. I retrieved the EpiPen but she said she never had one and didn&#39;t want to get it yet. She was conscious the whole time and appeared to be hyperventilating so we never administered the Epipen. She said her fingers were tingly and requested we call the paramedics so we did. They arrived very timely and took over. They took her BP and it was fine. They asked if she wanted to go to the hospital and she said no. She stated she was starting to feel better, she could breath more easily. She  eventually was able to sit up and the paramedics got her to call her son to come pick her up and the paramedics walked her out of the store to meet him.

On  April 15th - I was having pain in my left chest would I would inhale - I thought it was either lung or muscular but since it I have heart history I went to get it checked. It was muscular - it moved up from my chest to shoulder the next day and then went away after about a week. I was icing it and massaging it and taking muscle relaxers.  I had a routine visit with cardiologist yesterday. My blood pressure has been elevated lately and so they have added another blood pressure medicine for me to start - I just picked it up and will start tomorrow - Losartan  - 25 mg (and I am already on Metoprolol) and I&#39;m taking an antibiotic for a procedure I had done on Friday

                                                Two days after the vaccine I was getting headaches and my blood pressure was a little high. I was given new blood pressure medicine when I visited my doctor. The headaches continued intermittently for two weeks and then they came back. Three weeks after the vaccine I had muscle contractions with the headaches from the base of my neck up to my head. I was also getting cramps in my legs. I went to the ER and they said I was extremely dehydrated, so they gave me an IV. I was given a muscle relaxant. The muscle contractions subsided in two days. I developed a big red spot which my doctor identified as a  Hematoma a week later where the IV was inserted. About two days later I developed a big red blotch on my stomach which looked like the spot on my arm.  My doctor said she thought it was a yeast infection on my stomach. I have also been having weird stomach pains in the last couple of days which started as spasms before but now it feels like my stomach is on fire. The headaches cleared up  after four weeks but they are better now.  ER

I was told the spot was hot were the shot was administer and to put cold compresses on the arm. Take ibuprofen 800 to help with pain. Prescription was given on Monday 5/24/2021.

                                                Patient immediately felt pain in upper left shoulder and felt injection had been given too high based on other injections in the past.  She came in to see Nurse Practitioner as she was still having pain 17 days after the injection.  Patient had also had a decrease range of motion with trouble reaching for things and putting on her seatbelt behind her.  The NP sent her for physical therapy.. PT did not help so she came in to see Dr. n 4/28/21.  Dr.  thought it was SIRVA and discussed the case with an orthopedist.  Based on that discussion short term therapy on methylprednisolone was tried, which helped minimally briefly.  So patient was then seen by the orthopedist on 5/24/21 who ordered an MRI.  However, the MRI was denied because the patient had not completed 6 weeks of PT.  However after 6 PT sessions there was no improvement of pain or ROM.  Pain is 8/10 in the morning and is improved to 5/10 after ibuprofen by afternoon.  Ice also helps with the pain.  Dr.  will appeal getting the MRI as it failed to help, but this has not been approved yet.  Patient is still having trouble sleeping on left side and the pain awakens her at night.  ROM when reaching for things or putting on seatbelt still a problem and causes increased pain.

My primary care doctor put me on two courses of prednisone, and it did help, but when I go off of it, it really bothers me. It feels tingly and like it still has a light burn.  I am still feeling this 3 months after the vaccine. It?s very annoying.

Pain and tingling in my arms. In addition a few weeks into it pain in my inner thighs and strange bruising patterns down my thighs, and tingling legs. severe  bladder pain, and constant feeling  that I need to go to bathroom (bladder infection was ruled out). Pain is usually much worse at night. Sleep has become very difficult. Throat issues to a degree that I constantly have to clear my throat before I&#39;m able to talk  Massages, acupuncture helps, also tried PT for jaw area. IV immunity drips (does not help) Saw 2 general practitioners, one osteopath, one gynecologist, and dentist.  There are days which are better and then days where I can&#39;t work and need to cancel my patients.

Also when I laid down for the night, I was accutely aware of my heartbeat, which according to my smartwatch was beating at a rate of 71.  The next morning, I still was experiencing chills, and felt achy/stiff/sore muscles - possibly from tensing up and  shivering all night.  Pain at the injection shot also started the morning after the shot.  By bedtime the day after the shot, the symptoms had eased up.  The next morning the symptoms were gone, except for a little residual injection site discomfort.

                                                The day of the vaccine I felt sick in the evening by 6pm. I had a fever of 101.6 and I had chills and body aches. I had a headache coming on. The day after my temperature was 101 in the morning. The headache and and fatigue lasted three days. I got a rash on day four. My ankles were itchy at first. By lunchtime there was a rash across my back. A flat rash that spread up and down my back. It was different in spots like a round shape rash on my shoulder blade. My forearm and right knee also had a rash. The rash was redder and covered more of my body from my thighs up to my shoulder on the back. It was spreading very itchy for three days. I went to the doctor and started taking Allegra which improved the rash but it is still very itchy after 9 days.

On Sunday (2 days later), I awoke covered in a raised, itchy rash all over my body.   It lasted until Tuesday.   On Wednesday, I had severe muscle tightening in both calves, originating in the muscle behind my knees.  It was so painful, I couldn?t stand in one spot for longer than 10-15 seconds.   I had to either sit or walk.  I finally have relief from that pain today (Friday).

She also experienced shortness of breath.  She stated she took benadryl every 2 hours for the rash which controlled it and monitored herself with the shortness of breath.  She also stated that since she was asthmatic if the shortness of breath would have gotten worse she would have gone to the ER (luckily this wasn&#39;t necessary).

                                                I was vaccinated last Wednesday, March 24, at 8 pm with the Janssen vaccine.  As soon as I was vaccinated (on my left arm), I put on my coat and I felt a brief  and sharp pain in my left arm. And nothing else. On Friday night, I felt a very slight tingling in my left hand. And pain in the upper arm, in the region between the place where the vaccine was applied and my elbow. This pain seemed to spread to the forearm. Since then, I have tingling / numbness in my left hand and forearm and pain throughout my left arm, left shoulder, upper left center of the back and neck. And these pains and numbness have been increasing every day. Ten days have passed since the vaccine was applied and the condition only worsens. I took Voltaren in the last 3 days and the pain has not subsided. I am worried and scared. Was it a case of thrombosis or pulmonary embolism? In addition, I saw in the CDC information that, during the JNJ vaccine tests, there was a case of a severe reaction called brachial neuritis; as I didn?t know what it was, I did a Google search and, apparently, the symptoms I have coincide with those of this disease. Anyway, what do you advise me to do? I have waited until now imagining that the pain and numbness would lessen. But the opposite happened and everything just makes it worse. I look forward to feedback and guidance. I haven&#39;t been to a doctor yet, but it looks like it will be necessary. Thanks.

(nothing was awful, I was told I should report so that you have for data on how common reactions to the shot are.  I took a couple naps and by 5pm the next day was fine)

Started with numb lips and spread from there.  Went to the pharmacy and pharmacist gave me benadryl an d told my husband to take me to ER.   Sat in ER a long time and Benadryl started working so I left.  Took Benadryl every 4 hours.  Tried to lower dose to one pill this morning and became itchy and have hives again (19 hours after vaccine).

                                                Within a few hours after the vaccine was administered, I felt unwell and became progressively worse. For 36 hours after the vaccine, I experienced a crisis of energy, fatigue, and body soreness. It subsided after 36 hours. I expected that was a reasonable response for my already highly sensitive and overactive immune system (autoimmunity). What I didn&#39;t expect was two weeks later to erupt with shingles. I have had shingles twice in my earlier adult life, so I am familiar with the symptoms. This course has gotten worse over the last 2-1/2 weeks. There was no other change in my low-stress life with the exception of the Covid vaccine. I had been working hard to reduce my inflammation already with diet and lifestyle changes for the last 2 years with great success. It seems the vaccine triggered my immune system in such a profound way it pulled this dormant virus out. I was concerned to get the vaccine because of my autoimmunity but decided to do it anyway, hoping for the best. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s advisable for people with existing immune conditions to tax their system this way. I know I&#39;m paying a high price.

                                                The day after the vaccine (Sunday, 3/21/21), I had severe leg pain--throbbing in both legs.  My legs felt warm to the touch.   I also had a severe headache all day and a feeling of disorientation like I couldn&#39;t focus or concentrate.  I felt light-headed and very tired.  There was swelling, redness, and pain at the injection site (my left arm) all the way down the left side of my body (under my arm and around my ribs).  I took Acetaminophen, but the pain persisted all day.  The pain in my legs was the worst symptom and it was so painful and uncomfortable that it was impossible to sleep that night.  I&#39;ve never felt anything like it. I was planning to go to an emergency clinic the next day if the pain continued.  I finally got to sleep in the morning  (Monday, 3/22/21) and slept for several hours.  When I woke up later that day (3/22/21), the pain was gone and I felt normal again.   I was still tired for the rest of the week and I continued to have swelling in my arm at the injection site, but otherwise, no other symptoms.  It took approximately 6 days for the pain and swelling in my arm to feel better.  I did not seek medical attention because the leg pain was gone within 24 hours, but I am concerned now and am wondering if there has been any permanent damage to my circulatory system or heart.  I have noticed that my pulse has been elevated for the last 3 weeks (as compared to normal).

                                                Immediate reaction in right arm-it felt like my arm was on fire. The pharmacist gave the shot extremely high-almost in the shoulder and the reaction was intensely painful.   Starting about 6 days later, the soreness of the shot developed into not being able to raise that arm at all without pain.  Now, a month later, the pain is worse and is waking me up at night. The injection site is not sore, but the arm itself is not functional without pain. About 2 weeks after the shot, I started having a fuzzy feeling in my head (not painful) and ears.  I am extremely sensitive to sound and feel almost dizzy at times. My speech has been slurred and words are not coming to me easily. I am extremely tired and feel foggy.

Felt fine until Wednesday then broke out in hives and later that day fainted. Still to this day I am breaking out almost every day and I think it is tied to heat. Met with doctor today and she put me on steroid to try to calm down the break outs and then re-evaluate.

A week later it became severe again and my left eye started swelling underneath so I had another tele appointment with HCP and was given a 10 day antibiotic - Augmentin and antibiotic eye drops

I do not appear to have any new dots and no other symptoms at this time.

Her symptoms continued to worsen, and woke up one morning and had so much pain that she could not move or breath and her husband called an ambulance and they took her hospital and diagnosed with a blood clot.  She was in the hospital for 3 days and now discharged on Eliquis.

The biggest problem is with my breast , they are swollen, under my breast are purple and red. I started to get chills, nausea, I could not wear a bra. The doctor treated it as mastitis, I was on two different antibiotics,  nothing has helped it, I&#39;m having to see a breast surgeon. no one knows what  this is and they are not sure.

                                                I went to the gym - I did a shoulder and chest day at the gym about 3 or 4 hours after the vaccine. Everything was normal. At 04:00 the next day, I was at the gym and I was about to change my clothes - and I felt this wave of anxiety which is very unusual for me. I took off my top to change and I had a full body rash - it was everywhere and hadn&#39;t been there an hour before. It was a histamine response that I was perceiving as anxiety. I was about 7 minutes from an ER, so I went to the Medical Center- nothing was swelling and I was able to breathe. They gave me two mls of Benadryl - they gave me a shot in the &#34;tush.&#34; The other &#34;cheek&#34; got a steroid (but not prednisone) dexamethasone, I think. They also gave me Pepcid orally. Told to take Pepcid twice a day for 5 days. They gave me steroid - oral prednisone - three tablets - once a day for three days (20 mg). It stopped the allergic reaction. It was a miserable week or so. The next day, I did my cardio - I had such a bloom of hives on armpits - fire and itching at the same time. I did no physical exercise for about three days. Then I went back to my regular activities. I tolerated what was going on (I was exacerbating the symptoms) but the allergy was done. Every day it got better. At two weeks, I was totally fine. I have returned to all my regular activities.

                                                Itchy hives began about 2 1/2 days after Janssen vaccination and continue to occur every day for more than 2 months at this point.  I also experienced severe chills the night of the injection.  I have only had hives one other time in my life and that happened 5 years ago in 2016, about 2 weeks after I started on insulin.  They lasted 3 days.  Sought treatment from a doctor and was referred to an Allergist.  Tried Benadryl and Benadryl cream, Pepcid Complete, Claritin and Xyrtec.  Currently treating with Allegra and Pepcid twice a day.   Hives start to break through about 11 hours after last dosage.

                                                Initially after injection, the site on my arm was sore for several days.  I am not sure that what follows is related to the vaccine, but my mother received the vaccine at the same time I did at the same location and she fell ill on June 4 June 3 around 1pm.  I had abdominal pain.  During a bowel movement I broke out into a cold sweat with shaking of limbs.  That bowel movement turned into diarrhea.  Then finished with nothing but dark blood.  I rested for a bit as I was having abdominal pain and still having dark blood as a bowel movement.  2-3 times.  When I got a change, I phoned my Primary Care Physician&#39;s office.  It was after hours and I spoke with a colleague that suggested I go to the ER to get checked out.

                                                The day after the J&amp;J vaccine I experienced the typical headaches, backache and sore arm which I was told to expect.  My headaches, backache and arm pain lasted approx  4 weeks.  I took advil/tylenol daily for weeks due to the discomfort.  My arm pain continues to persist three months after the vaccine.  I also developed swollen lymph nodes along my collar bones 3 months after the vaccine.  It is on the same side as my vaccine.  I have went from being 100% healthy and feeling great to constant arm pain,  occasional arm numbness, swollen lymph nodes (which I have never had in my life) and generally feeling  unlike my self.   I reached out to my Dr. and am awaiting bloodwork results.  I have three ultrasounds scheduled as well as 2 cat scans.  They are looking for blood clots and trying to figure out the pain at the injection site as well as swollen lymph nodes on the vaccine side.  In closing, I feel something is very wrong as my symptoms persist and multiply.

                                                About June 1, developed muscles/skin aches all over that felt different than muscle aches from overuse.  This lasted about 2 1/2 weeks.  I also had a sudden relapse of SIBO-constipation and bloating.  This is improving.   About June 20 I developed a rash on my mid-inner thighs (which is a place I had cool-sculpting 5 yrs ago - something I regret due to results).  I&#39;ve never had a bumpy red rash there.  The rash was also on my inner upper arms and wrists.  It was gone after about 8-10 days.  Then I had a bad reaction to a mild sunburn.   My right inner calf from ankle to knee developed densely populated blood spots (purpura?)  This also has never happened before.  Then on July 9 I developed a pain behind my right knee, outer side that has no cause.  I was concerned it was a blood clot and went to urgent care on July 10.  It&#39;s worsening, but labs showed it was not a clot (whew) but likely a continuation of an inflammatory response to the vaccine.  I anticipate it&#39;s not over.  (Anecdotally, I work with Covid Disease Investigators and I&#39;ve spoken with many cases who described COVID-19 moving around their body; some who had symptoms return or worsen  after a period of well-being and others who have had extreme reactions to the mRNA vaccines in which any area of health weakness flared extremely and they were quite sick.

About 10PM the same day I started feeling dizzy, bad headache, muscles and joint started aching all over my body, joints were hurting, a few hives on my torso and I was experiencing chills.  Went to sleep that night and was very ill the entire next day with fever, chills, aching all over, swollen lymph notes in my neck, in my left arm pit, coughing out excessive phlem, headache, sore joints, and hives on my arms, legs and torso.  It is now 7/12/2021 at 4:34PM, I am still dealing with hives wheels all over my legs, several small hives on my right arm and several hives on my belly and sides.  My antihistamine is helping to keep the hives in check.  I am still quite sore all over and the arm I received the injection in hurts a lot.

Then as that passed, my throat began to itch and inside my ears became itchy, then after about 5 minutes or so my tongue started to tingle on the front end and felt thicker at the back. After a total of 20 minutes or so after this started I was home and took a Benadryl, which helped, however after a few hours my face started itching, no rash just an itch and it is still itching after 5 days. It seems to be getting better every day.  It was definitely a similar type of reaction I get from raw pitted fruits.

Minor headache and dull aches throughout the body. Had to climb under an electric blanket, comforter and then another blanket on top to get warm and comfortable. As i drifted in and out of sleep through to the morning, I noticed the chills and shivering dissapating and was able to get some sleep. Awake now, still feeling a headache and flu-like aches to the body. Moving very slow. Arm  not really sore at injection site as it was upon receipt of vaccination.

I was really sick for the next few days. I was tired, too. The reflux made me go to the doctor - a couple weeks after vaccine. Increased symptoms of it real bad. They increased my Omeprazole dose from 20-40 mg. I have loose stools. They added a nose spray as well.  I had had my allergy shots the same week as I had my vaccine.

About 5 minutes following administration of the vaccine, patient started to develop a red and pruritic rash on the left forearm and left hand.  Patient related that she has an alcohol sensitivity where she develops red and itchy skin following consumption of alcoholic beverages.  She relates she also experiences cold urticaria where she develops a red, itchy rash following submersion in cold water.  When this occurs, she typically takes Benadryl or Zyrtec/Claritin (depending on the time of day), of which resolves the itching and the rash subsides.  She has an allergy to Bactrim.  She relates a past medical history of asthma, which she takes a daily inhaler, as well as uses her rescue inhaler twice a week.  She has not seen her PCP in about 1 year.  She denies chest pain/tightness, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face/lips/tongue/throat, skin rash/itching, cramping abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

These lasted a couple of days.  However, since the day after the vaccine, I have developed severe acid reflux and heartburn.  This occurs every time I eat anything.  I have NEVER in my life had heartburn or acid reflux; only after taking the vaccine.  I also have a heaviness in my chest and cough frequently.

It was very , very painful. It wakes me up almost every single night because it hurts. The pain will radiate  - now the pain is more in my arm area and now it&#39;s radiating to my back on on the shoulder blade area on the left side - my  neck is a tiny bit sore right. The soreness in the arm is always consistent but the radiating pain moves around somewhat. I am wondering if they gave me the injection incorrectly.  It doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s  what the description of &#34;COVID ARM.&#34; I don&#39;t have any swelling or redness and I haven&#39;t ever.  I take Aleve every now and then. I called the doctor last week and she told me to wait a couple of weeks and watch it.

The patient reports that she has history of chronic shingles and multiple autoimmune disorders. She takes daily antiviral therapy (valacyclovir).

Arm began severely itching followed by feet, other arm, legs, torso.  Treated with Benadryl and anti itch lotion. Lasted about 18 hours.  3 doses of Benadryl.  Also, the first night I did run a fever that broke in a couple of hours.  These were the only reactions I have experienced.

I felt red and puffy in my face on that side. I ended up getting flu like symptoms, and my arm hurt for about two weeks. I went to urgent care March 29th and was diagnosed with bronchitis , I did get a Covid test and it was negative. They put me on a antibiotics and inhaler. I followed up with my PCP, she changed the inhaler I was prescribed and told me If I don&#39;t get better to give them a call.  My arm is better but bronchitis is still there. The coughing is really bad at night and sometimes during the day.

                                                First, when the vaccine was administered, it felt like hot liquid going into my left arm and then my left arm down to my elbow felt on fire.  Around 4:45 I began to have chills, and when I arrived home about 5:15 I was shivering and freezing and full of body aches.  During the night I developed a fever of 103.7, 103.5.  My husband woke me to help cool me down with cool cloths and water.  My fever went down to 102 by morning and I still had body aches but not as bad.  I was lethargic and mentally fuzzy for a few days.  I did not feel well until Wednesday, March 24, 2021.

I visited Dr. and he has ordered tests to check on my heart. I told him I was concerned about the &#34;pause&#34; and the reason for pause because I feel pretty miserable, and he added a CT test that will be done in two to three weeks. I do not know if he will report my symptoms as possibly vaccine related.

                                                Had migraines (frontal lobe with flashing lights-distorted vision and difficult to hold my eyes open) from 3/20-3/24. (one week after vaccine) I do not get headaches, so this was very strange. On 3/23, I woke up with a bright red Left thumb- it looked and felt like a sunburn.  The next day (3/24), it was still bright red (fire engine red), swollen, hot to the touch and had a blister in my webspace.   I went to the dr 3/23 pm who was not sure what was going on, but prescribed an antibiotic (Keflex). This reduced my pain and swelling. Today it is still red and is now flaky, but not swollen or hot to the touch.   The main thing was the migraines as I do not get headaches.   I&#39;m not sure if that or the skin thing is related, but thought I should throw this information your way in case there have been others with similar symptoms.

                                                I developed a rash on my face (both checks and under my eyes) from the vaccine as well as fever of 102, nausea, vomiting, chills, sore arm, etc.  I went to the doctor because I was concerned that I had a rash on my face.  I did not have a rash on my arm which is where most people get the rash.  The doctor told me that the rash would fade in a few days and it did.  It is gone now.

                                                During observation while at the vaccination site I felt like in the middle of my forehead I was starting to have hives. But nothing could be seen. In the middle of the week it started getting red and I used hydrocortisone and it was that. On Friday 04/09 I woke up and my neck was itchy and burning, stingy, like pins or stuck in it, when I looked in the mirror there was a rash, different from hives. Some type of rash, just on the front, right below the crease of the neck and all the way across. I called the advice nurse line and I had a telehealth (video) appointment with the Urgent Care . I was prescribed some topical cream and some oral antihistamine and I just used the topical cream, not the pills. I used the cream as prescribed and I left the message to my doctor and send pics of the site and she sent me a message for an appt but since I kept using the topical cream it has been helping so I have not seen her yet.

After 4 days of that I got a really super heavy period with cramping and blood clots in my menustral flow.  It was a horrible period, while the one after the surgery in Feb was very light.  Dizzy and fatique  10 days after shot on the April 8 I took a fall from a chair outside, and from Thrusday to the Saturday  10th I ended up in the Emergency room with a concussion and head symptoms including dizziness and nose bleeds.  This was from a simple fall, and i suspect the covid shot might have caused complications after the fall with additional swelling and brusing.

                                                I would like to amend my first report to add that 2 days after I received the vaccine I noticed bruises in my hands and one in my leg. 2 bruises on my knuckles and also 2 on the side of my hands. They are symmetric, I did not hit my hands anywhere. My husband also noticed a small bruise on my right leg. They were very prevalent the first week I received the vaccine and they are slowly fading away. The ones in my hands are almost gone, the one in my leg is very small now. You can still see it though. After seeing about the Janssen vaccine being associated with blood clots I had a virtual visit with my doctor, and he does not seem very concerned about blood clots but asked me to come in for some blood work. I did not go yet because I would like to wait for at least 28 days after the vaccine to go in and have the blood work done. I also remember I had a very bad headache one day soon after I got the vaccine but I was battling some sinuses issues before the vaccine, so I am not sure if that was related to sinuses or not. I took an Advil and it went away. And my arm still hurts a little, not as often as before. The pain comes and goes. Before it would happen several times during the day now it is more like once a day and once it goes away it just comes back the next day.

I received the Jansen vaccine through a special monitored vaccine clinic due to a past severe reaction to a Shingrix vaccine. I did not have any immediate symptoms after the Jansen vaccine. The following day I developed aches/pains and fever to 103, but this resolved within 48 hours. I then noticed itching, swelling and pain at the site of the injection and developed a mild headache, called my primary doctor on 4/13/21 and was seen on 4/14/21 at which time a CBC was done.  CBC including platelets-normal.  However, within the next few days a more severe headache then developed, which was severe enough to limit my activities by 4/16/21. Because of the rare problem of thrombocytopenia associated with clotting, it was advised I not take aspirin or ibuprofen. I also was having some mild abdominal pain, low grade fever (to 100.7), malaise, dysuria and arthralgias. My headache continued to be limiting my daily activities and on 4/17/21, I went to a Urgent Care. However, they were unable to check and get results back on a CBC within that day, I had a normal neurological exam, my UA had some abnormal findings but not clearly indicative of a UTI and a culture is pending.  A rapid Covid test was negative.  It was recommended that if I was concerned I could proceed to a local ED for further testing. I  decided to continue to try conservative treatment and monitoring at home. As of today 4/18/21, the headache has mostly resolved and I no longer have a fever. I am still having some dysuria and joint pains.

                                                4/5/2021--Received Janssen vaccine.  Felt very hot during the day.   4/6/2021--Woke up with very bad headache and rash on the injected arm plus on my stomach.  Went for a walk and felt pain in my left calf and achilles tendon.  Went to work.  4/7/2021--Started my work day as a Personal Trainer/Fitness Instructor at 6am as usual.  Taught cycling classes and trained a few clients.  Went for walk.  Still had a headache.  When I got in my car to head home, my vision was super blurry and I felt very dizzy.  I ate an orange and peanuts and hydrated more.  I was not even sure I could drive home.  I got home told my family how I was feeling.  My husband noticed my eyes were very red and swollen.  I took a shower, drank a smoothie and ate a salad.  Used my aunt&#39;s BP cuff to check my BP and it was 148/99.  I have NEVER had HBP.    4/8/21--Woke up feeling disoriented as if the left side of my face, body were off--neurological stuff.  I went to reach for grapes in the refrigerator and could not grab them.  I felt like I have never felt before and ask my husband to drive me to the ER.  While at the waiting room at the ER, I felt chest tightness and pain and nauseous.  My BP was 153/111.  Again, I have never been diagnosed or been treated for hypertension.  They did EKG, lab tests, chest X-ray.  Once my BP came down, they sent me home.   This is before all the JJ Janssen vaccine &#34;news&#34; came out and the reasons it was paused.  I developed a very bad cough about two hours after I got home from the ER.  4/9/11--Made appointment with a brand new primary care doctor.  Saw her on Monday 4/12/2021 as recommended by ER.  I had never met her before.  She prescribed a very low dose of BP medication, which I did not take because the number one side-effect is dry-cough.  I was already coughing a lot, later on with blood.  4/11/2021--Still feeling pretty bad, I woke up to the news of the Janssen vaccine being paused.  Frankly, I felt relieved that I was not going crazy.  This truly has been one of the hardest things I have ever gone (and still am) going through.  I became concerned about the pain in the left calf and heel could be a clot.   Called primary care doctor.  Had ultrasound of legs and chest x-ray the following day   4/12/2021--Had persistent cough with blood.  Went to ER at 9pm.  Had EKG, blood work, CT without contrast of chest, covid test--negative.  Got home around 2am.  4/19/21--Followed up with primary care doctor who after explaining to her I am extremely fatigued, still blurry vision, dizzy, cough better but not gone, chest discomfort on the left side, she referred me to an ophtamologist and cardiologist.  My insurance and this poorly established referral system is very difficult to navigate.  Up to now I am still waiting for the referral and pre-aurhtorization to the opthtamologist.  (4/23/2021).  I want to say, I am pretty healthy. I have worked in fitness and wellness for over 30 years. I have never drank alcohol, smoked or done any drugs.  Prior to this no physician has told me I have HBP or any issues for which I have to be medicated.  I take zero medications.  Even when I had the bad headache from the vaccine I took nothing.  I have not worked in two weeks and had not driven until last saturday.  If I don&#39;t work, I don&#39;t get paid.   I pay for almost $600/month for my insurance in the marketplace.  This has been another stressor of this storm.  Getting providers to really listen and insurance companies to take situations like this seriously.   I could not drive at night.  This has been rough and I look forward to being myself soon.  This reaction felt like a heart attack/stroke with extreme fatigue, acid reflux, cough with some blood, muscular pain.  The rash and headaches were the least of my concerns.  I am not yet recovered from all of this.  I sure hope there is no permanent damage and that this too shall pass.  It is important to note that I have tried reporting this event several times to the VAERS website online.  I completed the 4-5 pages multiple times and it would not let me submit.  I also called the VAERS 1-800 number to report and they told me to go back to the online form.  I left several messages when I could not get it done online and to this date no one has called me back.  I called to report my adverse reaction and they told me they do not take that info.  I also called the health dept.  After several phone calls to them a nurse called me back but did not take a formal report.  When someone is feeling pretty sick, this is a lot to ask of.  I persisted because I feel this is important to be reported.

                                                6 days after receiving the vaccination, my upper left arm muscles became quite painful.  Pain increased each day to the point of limiting arm range of motion, especially abduction and internal rotation.  Today is 4/25, I am still unable to internally rotate my arm, or reach behind myself due to the severity of the pain in the muscles.  Pain also prevents me from sleeping on my left side which is my natural sleep position.  I have tried OTC meds, stretching, hot/cold compresses and self massage none of which has worked to loosen up and reduce pain in my arm.   Although the level of pain is no longer increasing each day, it is not decreasing at all.

Bright red, hot, itchy splotches tarted on upper arms (symmetrical on both), buttocks, abdomen and eventually worked it&#39;s way down arms, legs and feet. Cleared up by next morning, just in time for my in-person Dr. visit. Resurfaced a few hours later before completely clearing up the following am. Rash lasted about 36-48 hrs total.

It was mildly warm, red and slightly itchy.  Went to see her physician the next day, he circled the red area. It was about 4 inches in diameter.  She took benadryl and ibuprofen.  No signs up systemic reaction.

                                                My appointment was on time, 4pm on 4/3 at the Pharmacy.  The young girl that gave me the shot told me she was certified, and she gave me the shot in the presence of her manager.  I have given  myself shots for years with diabetes, plus many flu shots, and have never felt pain like that.  I expressed this to her, how painful it was, and she just said &#34;I know, I know...&#34; as if it was normal for the shot to be so painful. I knew instantly something was wrong.  They were more worried, it seemed, about a potential adverse reaction such as an allergy shock, since I&#39;m allergic to a few things, but I did not experience that.  I waited 15 minutes, my arm hurting the whole time, and they suggested I go buy Tylenol for the pain, which I did.  My left arm has hurt since then. I got a horrible bruise from this shot (will send picture) that took weeks to heal.  Since then I&#39;ve continued to feel pain and don&#39;t have full mobility of my left arm. I can type, but not lifting anything heavy and have to go easy with anything on the left side.  I thought at first it might be what people were calling &#34;covid arm&#34; but I discovered that was more about soreness, not pain.  I tried ibuprofin, but after three weeks I&#39;d had enough and made a doctors appointment.  Since I was also noticing my left shoulder was very tense and tight, and I was starting to get neck stiffness in same area, I started googling before my appointment.  When I entered my symptoms, SIRVA kept popping up, so I wondered if that was what I now had because of the improper vaccine administration.  I asked my doctor for an MRI order to find out, but she said we needed to do an Xray first (which only showed mild issues related to osteo).  She offered a prescription of taking Advil 400 mg three times and day and to use a muscle relaxer when I needed it, such as at night (Cyclobenzaprine).  She said to try that for a week, and if it wasn&#39;t better, that another Dr could order MRI.  Since then I&#39;ve also added a pain spot under my left shoulder blade. Insurance called and said the order was &#34;under review&#34; so that&#39;s where things stand now. If they don&#39;t approve, I guess I will go next to an orthopedist for guidance?  This has cost me health, due to lack of sleep also - I wake up with pain in the middle of the night, even when I take the meds. Praying for a diagnosis, and solution, soon.

I feel like a light and shock in the ankle several times a day at times. Sometimes the pain moves to my arch. I went to ER, a week after the pain started. They gave me an arthritis cream and the compression stockings for my legs the first ER visit. The pain did not even subside with either of these. I used the cream as directed four times a day. I did it for 20 days but it didn&#39;t do anything. Second ER visit - four to five days afterwards 0   when I had the bruising starting and the swelling and they took x-rays and gave me an ultrasound. They didn&#39;t find anything wrong. ER- the second time as well.

                                                The day after the vaccine I had bad joint pain, heavy fatigue and fever. I also had a cluster headache  for one day. The joint pain lasted 4-5 days. For two weeks I felt inflamed and fatigued for two full weeks after that day. I felt very poorly like I had a low grade fever. Two to three weeks after the vaccine I noticed spot on my upper lip that was raw and hot. It is across my whole upper lip at the same time. It is red but not swollen and most noticeable when it becomes dry. Cold seems to help and some balm helps when it is at the dry stage.  After it settles down it gets really dry and then it heals up.  I keep getting the spots on my upper lips. It cycles for a 5-6 day period and it gets better and it returns and repeats the cycle. I always have a feeling that my lip is twitching before it comes up. It has been eight weeks and I have had the condition with my lip cycle six times since the vaccine. I have never had anything like this before. It is always the same and has not improved any with each cycle. The last time it was dormant for longer (10 days) but it seems to be worse with a bigger gap.

The evidence was not noted on the previous visit. I am not sure if it has anything to do with the vaccine. I developed a rash on 06/02/2021. It started on my elbow and then it moved to my thighs and it is mostly on my arms and legs. It has been there for 10 days so far. It has spread and it is red little bumps like a skin irritation and it is itchy. I have not taken any new medication recently.  I am planning on seeing a doctor for the rash.

When he pulled the needle out of my arm quite a bit of blood ran down my arm even though I wasn&#39;t on any blood thinners. Fortunately, the pharmacists got me through it and I started to feel better in a few minutes. I ended up bruising very badly at the site of the shot. It took several weeks to go away completely.   Three months later in June 2021, I have been experiencing prolonged unexplained pain in my left leg. Ultrasound showed no blood clots.

Then within 48 hours of getting it I had severe throbbing pain at the injection site high up on my arm.  I assumed it was normal since they said you could experience pain at the injection site.  However, the pain did not go away and I started to lose range of motion in my arm and started getting extreme sharp pain along with the almost constant throbbing pain if I moved my arm certain ways.

                                                The next morning after the vaccine my fingertips went numb at 10 am.  This numbness persisted approx 8 hours despite my pumping my arms and flexing my fingers, which would normally get circulation pumping and alleviate &#34;asleep&#34; finger feeling that might occur on a rare occasion.    The numbness in my digits came back a week later on Tuesday, July 13, and was later followed about an hour later by a tingling burning feeling in my hands late Tuesday night.  It was uncomfortable and kept me from sleeping much the night.  Now it is Wednesday, July 14 and my hands are better and I don&#39;t feel that prickly sensation at this moment of writing this report - just a bit of fingertip numbness.   I would like to be contacted regarding what step I can and should take regarding my numbness and prickly hands.    I also had injection site soreness for 5 days after the vaccine on my left shoulder.  That is now better.

I got headachey, alternating between hot and cold chills, a little bit of nausea and extreme tiredness.   This continued for the next 5 days which seemed like they were considered mild reactions according to the CDC website.  Most concerning though, is on day 5, (3/14/21) in the evening as I was getting into bed, I started getting a red, extremely itchy rash on both my arms, my lower back and my upper legs, to the point that I could not sleep because it was so itchy and had to take Benedryl.  I have not changed anything in my diet or in the products I use on my body, so I can only attribute this reaction to this vaccine.  I am still a little itchy on my arms today 3/15/21.   I am also still getting the hot and cold chills and still have a little bit of nausea, not bad, but enough to be &#34;off&#34; certain foods.

I took Benadryl and itch is subsiding. I hope this is the end of side effects!

I developed a very red rash, mostly on my lower legs up to the knees, some slight rash on forearms. I used topical benadryl and it went away, but came back later that day. That lasted 36 - 48 hours and was completely gone.

On 03-16-2021 I woke up and the left side of my shoulder, both knees, both legs and both feet are inflamed.  I also have cramps to both of my shoulders. On Saturday 03-20-2021 when I woke up my right eye was also inflamed but only lasted one day. I have spasms to my calves with leg cramps. I can not sleep at night due to the inflammation.  I went to see my PCP this morning who prescribed a leg cream for the cramps, but I do not know the name. My blood pressure today in the morning was 154/96.  My doctor said it was a reaction to the vaccine.

I woke up at 1:30am freezing cold and hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t get out of bed. 45 minutes later I managed to get to the bathroom and took my temp which was 103.2. I took more ibuprofen, the fever subsided to 101. I continued having a fever for 2 days along with body aches and feeling very tired. Felt fully recovered after 4 days.

The numbness feels like it is about to go to sleep (no pins or needles feelings) I have feeling and grip strength, just feels like it is about to go asleep.    The body rash went away when I took Benadryl when I got home at 11:00 am.    I am still having the numbness in my hand and fingers but not as bad and not as long.  Off and on daily now (1 week out from the vaccine).

                                                Patient started experiencing mild itching in the right arm initially and then later reached the back and upper legs starting after 5 minutes post vaccination. The patient received the Janssen COVID vaccine in the left arm, but the itching was only on the right arm. The patient was monitored for an additional 15 minutes for a total of 30 minutes. The severity did not get any worse after 30 minutes. The patient did not have any other reactions. Benadryl was recommended to the patient for itch relief. The pharmacy followed up with the patient after she went home and her condition did not get any worse. She plans to use some anti-itch remedies for the itching.

I have never really had hives before.  They were extremely itchy and irritating.  I took some antihistamines which seemed to work well.  I tried both Allegra and Benedryl.

Terrible headache that eventually turned into serious migraine.  Asked pharmacist, next morning if it was allowed to take an Imitrex injection for migraine after having vaccine.  Pharmacist said it was ok to take injection. Helped reduce migraine enough to be in bed resting the rest of that following day. Recovered and back to normal by next day the 25th. With Janssen vaccine concern now with cerebral clotting with severe headache as a sign, decided to report bad side effects and make sure I shouldn?t be having anything else checked for precaution.

Sometime between 2:30-3:00 am I think I fell asleep, but between 4:00-6:30am I was sweating profusely, and finally got up at 7:00am to change my bed sheets and clothesjust soaking

No issues at all until 11 p.m., started with sudden onset high fever (103), shaking chills, mild short-lived nausea, and immediate thumping splitting headache and very severe body aches and joint pain.  In bed until 12 noon the next day  feeling terrible.  On couch rest of day with fever fluctuating from 100.3 to 101.1. Went to bed 4/13/2021 with 101.1 fever, woke up 5-6 times drenched in sweat (fever trying to break?) and then was able to get out of bed, fever resolved.  Still achy and puny on 4/14/2021 but much better.  I took NO medications during the side effects/adverse events from the J&amp;J vaccine.  I do have significant left arm pain at the injection site still on 4/14 but there was no redness, warmth, or rash at the site, arm looks completely normal.    Very typical flu like reaction.

I woke up in the middle of the night with severe stomach pains and cramping a few days after the vaccination.  In the next few days I had a bad headache, nausea, and diarrhea.  Something felt different and wrong in my abdominal cavity.  I had shooting pains and my whole abdomen hurt and was sensitive and sore when I pressed it.  My husband put me on the phone on Friday night April 9 with    They took all of my information (name, phone #, address, email, vaccination information and location, symptoms).  They said they searched the database and could not find my matching reaction symptoms. They offered no guidance.  The next day I passed blood through my anus without stools.  I was still in pain and soreness for a few more days.  I called the  again on Tuesday to report the blood.  They claimed to not be able to find my original report in the system.  They seemed not to care which really upset me. I did not fill out a new report with them as I felt I would just be wasting my time.

For days later, I began to feel, ill all over and could not get out of bed.  I had severe abdominal pain, aches and pains all over my body.  Particularly in places where I had pre existing conditions.  As the day progressed, I continued to have severe GI issues, could not eat (pain like food was stuck) heart burn, constipation (clamy like flu).  Shortness of breath, I could not walk far.  I took 3 trips to the ER where they treated for the abdominal spasms, UTI, and pain.  By the end of the week I had a slight fever.  I tested negative for COVID during that time.  For two weeks I was unable to eat, get out of bed.  I had several petite mal seizures.

Dr said I&#39;m having an inflammatory response to vaccine and they have referred me to a rheumatologist (gave me a referral) - joint pain and itching hasn&#39;t gone away at all. (The really bad rash on my neck, upper chest and torso and back on day three - that rash is gone but that tingling and itching of having the rash hasn&#39;t  gone away.) I&#39;m working still but I&#39;m working from home - so that has been okay - although some days I feel worse then others.  I noticed yesterday that my breasts were swollen/lumpiness. Was born with fiber cystic breasts - since menopause that has gotten better but now this feels like it did back then - feels like it did when I was going to start my period. I haven&#39;t had a period since five years ago. Eye sensitivity: Normally have dry eyes but it&#39;s worsened. I have to put drops in multiple times of day. I literally wake up in the middle of the night with almost a sandpaper feeling in my eyes and have to put drops on them. I have been doing acupuncture - it will be my third time today - it helps with stress and the anxiety from these symptoms.  They wanted me to take steroids - I&#39;m trying not to do something like this because I am so sensitive to these types of things.

It did not itch at the vaccination site. The itching began in both forearms and was quite intense. Over the next few hours, the itching spread down my body, mild on my torso, mild on my upper legs, worse on my lower legs (comparable to arms) and worst at the ankles and lower leg. As it moved down my body, the upper itchiness seemed to ease. I took a single capsule of Benadryl which had little effect. After four hours, I took two Benadryl capsules and finally fell asleep. The itching has mostly stopped today.

                                                Received Johnson and Johnson Covid19 shot in left arm. Left arm was very sore next day, March 31, 2021 along with mild sore throat, no fever. Same with my husband who received shot at same time as myself. On April 1, 2021 his arm was slightly sore then went away. My left arm remained extremely tender for a few days at the injection location. That started to fade slowly but arm was sore in joint area and has remained so even now. It aches and is hard to use at times. Example: when taking shirt off over my head, I cannot lift arm up to this without extreme pain. I cannot lay on left arm when sleeping and when I reach over to turn alarm off in morning with left arm, I must use right hand to help use arm. It is a constant ache, just hurts bad even now. I feel like at times I cannot move arm. I ride a stationary bike to exercise and most of the time cannot use arm on handle because of the extreme pain. I cannot take pain medication due to my stomach issues.

The unexpected effect is tingling and coldness in both hands/fingertips.   I could logically assume it is from the swelling in the neck pressing on the nerves, as I have experienced a similar feeling occasionally in the past due to compressed discs in my spine and neck.  At this point I am not particularly alarmed but I wanted to make you aware of this side effect.

By morning my neck and shoulders were achy as well as my left arm and I was still a little fatigued. By the next day my only symptom was soreness in my upper arm and especially at the injection site.  5 days after the injection I still have soreness at the injection site. I took a few doses of tylenol and rested. My job  has forced a 10 day isolation on me because they said fatigue and achy muscles are signs of COVID-19. So I am getting plenty of rest.

Progressed to coughing and feeling a lump in my throat and then tightness in my chest. My blood pressure elevated to 152/100. At that point I self administered epi pen and paramedics called 911. This provided relief but after about 5 to 10 minutes the tightness in my chest and the feeling I couldn?t get a deep breath began to return and the paramedics administered two puffs of an albuteral inhaler and transported me to the hospital. At the ER, they did an EKG, started an IV and administered fluids, prednisone and Benadryl. I was discharged about 90 -120 minutes later with a prescription for 3 days of prednisone (50mg) and instructions to continue to take 25 mg oral Benadryl every 4 hours.  The next morning my face and chest were red and looked like I was sunburned. My face was also swollen.

                                                I got the shot in my left arm and shortly after right above my right eye I could feel a reaction going on. Almost like something effected the muscle, I didn&#39;t say anything and went to the wait room I mentioned it before I left and they said it sounded like a migraine and I went home.  When I raise my face on the right side of my eyebrow area feels like I have spasms. When I got home it moved to my cheek area as well and felt strange.  I got a rash on my right cheek that evening and a super bad headache. I took a Benadryl and went to sleep. I didn&#39;t have a fever.  By the morning the rash was gone, the only thing that bothered me was my eyebrow area ( muscle area) I went to the Dr the following day and she said it sounded like it was my sinuses. Prior to this I was having allergy / sinus issues.

                                                After my vaccine I had tenderness in my right arm at injection site and a sharp pain in my right clavicle bone. The clavicle bone pain slowly went to an ache. But then I noticed my arm was ballooning up a d the injection site was hard. Then, About a week after my COVID vaccine, I experienced leg pain (left) behind my knee and my arm was getting larger and warm to the touch. My first appointment with my doctor was 3/24/2021 at 1215pm. He checked out the areas and ordered a ultrasound Doppler of my left knee. I called the vaccine center as it says on the paper given with the vaccine. I spoke to someone and explained my symptoms. She suggested a ultrasound of my arm as well. I called my primary care doctor who added my arm to the order.

Got up on the seventh day and started again all over my body now, tried cortizone but it is not helping. I haven&#39;t changed anything so figured it had to be from the vaccine. I read where you can get it from the vaccine and it could last 2 to 12 days. Anything else I can use to stop the itching? Will I be okay or should I go to the hospital?

                                                After my J&amp;J vaccine, my right arm felt hot and was red and I also ended up with an upset stomach, had diarrhea and felt sick to my stomach. I also experienced chills, low grade fever of 99.8 and had swelling to my joints in my fingers and toes. My right arm pain radiated upwards to my neck. These symptoms lasted 12 hours and as of today I still have pain in my neck. Since 03-15-2021, I have been seeing a chiropractor for my neck pain. I see him on a weekly basis. At the chiropractor&#39;s office they apply ice, heat and do a muscle rub help with my neck pain that still is present.

I walked around a bit to cool off and started feeling itchy.  So I took one of my Pills for Itching the Hydroxyzone at 25 mg.  after a while the itching lessoned.   I did wake up with a fever but did not realize it because I take the Celebrex on a regular schedule for pain in my spine.  I only realized I had a fever When the cold feeling started to subside after taking my morning dose of the Celebrex.

The hives eventually moved down to her feet on day 7.  The patient is still reporting hand sensitivity/itching if exposed to heat. The patient was prescribed pepcid, steroid shot, and prednisone taper.  She is also using topical hydrocortisone cream.  The steroid injection has helped with symptom management per the patient.  (patient is also getting allergy injections and had received her allergy injection about 3 weeks before her covid vaccine)

                                                Approximately 11 days after being vaccinated I had a rash that 3 days later became very painful and proved to be shingles.  Dr suggested I report it as a possible adverse reaction to the vaccine.  I was given a prescription called Valacyclovir (generic for Valtrex) 1 gm to take 3 times a day for 7 days.  I was also given patches called ZTlido to wear around the infected area for 12 hours on and 12 hours off for 7 days.    The outcome is not yet known since I only just begun the medication.  If all goes well, I won&#39;t have to go back to see the Dr.  However, if the pain and rash has not cleared up in 7 days, I will have to go back.

I started to get Migraines which became very painful four days after the vaccine. I had to go to the ER because the pain was so bad one day that I almost passed out. It is a much different pain than my normal Migraines my left arm and leg were numb. I have been getting Migraines daily for five weeks now. I have been trying to control my diet and switched medication in an effort to control the Migraines. The medication helps a little if I take it early. I also still get a little of the numbness in the left side of my body. All services provided by insurance company.

                                                She got her vaccine, her arm stayed sore for about 4 days and didn&#39;t notice it anymore.  She was tired feeling, just yucky feeling, no energy to do anything.  Then after that it was more of not sleeping well, tossing and turning all night.  Then about 2 weeks after that she had noticed that her hair was coming off out of the brush and then her brush was full of hair.  A friend looked at her head and said that she had a bald spot and then realized that there were spots.  The one started at about the size of a half dollar and now are the size of a grapefruit.  The other three are larger than a 50 cent piece.  She has lost about 40% of her hair, and it is very thin especially straight down on the middle, and the others are to the side and one to the corner, which this hair loss has not stopped.   Most of them are in the back of her head but does have one coming in the front as well .   She also has had a headache that she wakes up with every day and takes Ibuprofen and Tylenol alternatively which she did not have before the vaccine.    She went to her doctor when she noticed the hair falling out and has run blood work, urine screening and the only thing came back was that her blood was too thick and she was started on a baby aspirin.   Her doctor wants to do additional testing, CAT scans, and other blood work.

                                                Pain in left shoulder and at injection site that began immediately upon injection and never went away and has gotten worse over the past few months.  The pain radiates up the neck and down the arm past the elbow.  No loss of mobility but painful with movement.  Pain subsides with no movement, reclining position and laying down.  Ibuprofen seems to help.  I believe the injection was incorrectly administered.

The lump is still present on day 11 and is still tendor to the touch. I have not seen anyone regarding this adverse effect as I am hoping it eventually goes away.

                                                On the day of the vaccine, about 5 hours after, I started feeling fatigue. I felt like I had been awake for 24&#43; hours. That evening I was watching television, covered with a blanket, and my nose got very cold and tingly. I felt like I was breathing cold air. That did resolve later that evening. The next day I was really fatigued and felt dizzy. I felt this way all day. Later that day I started itching. My head, legs and arms were itching. At 11PM that night I called the Hospital and spoke with a nurse to see what I could take for the itching. I was told that since it was after 24 hours from the injection, I was able to take Benadryl. I had to take it every day for the week. I continued to have fatigue and dizziness for 2 days after receiving the vaccine. My psoriasis was healing and had almost gone away, but 2 days after the injection I had a flare. I stayed in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis stayed in a flare until around 05/12/2021. I had to receive several steroid injections and B12 injections to calm everything down.

That&#39;s when I went to the dr&#39;s office because I thought I might have shingles. The dr started me on valtrex for a week. I was told because I work in a cancer center that I could not be at work with shingles. They thought that I might be contagious and I had to work from home for four days before they cleared me to come back to work.

I left between services due to being dizzy, fever chills, achy, body aches.  3/22 didn&#39;t go to work. But by midday felt better.  *Every week for a month, the hives would disappear and reappear in another place.  *6th week I went to urgent care as the hives were around stomach. Prednisone. Rash/hives went away.  5/11/2021 I went to work first part of the day. I left work at 11:00am. The cough started. 5/12 my results showed second strain positive for COVID.   5/18  Cough persisted and boss advised to go seek medical attention as been sick for a while. I went to urgent care. He put me on an antibiotic and pill that makes me stop coughing . The dr. didn&#39;t seem to think that I had COVID as I had been vaccinated. I had a low grade fever. He did the COVID test. I was able to access the records online the following day.  *Off from work, could go back after my fever had left. My fever left on 5/22 *I missed approximately 6.5 days of work. I missed another day after vaccination, as well.

                                                Itching started Sunday night on arms and has moved to more of the body.  The itching continues with welts.  Itching is from torso throughout upper body.  No itching on face or legs.  Itching is worse at nights.  The first night after vaccine I did run fever and headache but those symptoms were gone the next morning.

                                                Two hours after receiving vaccine, I experienced sudden onset extremely painful throat, swollen gooey uvula, followed by hives on face, neck, chest, and underarms, moderately swollen lips and eye areas. I took Benadryl 1/2 hour after onset, eventually resolving hives and face swelling. 25 hours later, I&#39;m still experiencing the painful throat/swollen uvula issue. Appetite is fine, though swallowing is painful. Injection sight became painful 18-20 hours after vaccination.

Today, March 22rd, I noticed a red rash on my face (similar to rosacea). My cheeks and ears feel warm to the touch, and I have a mild itch on the entire  area. The rash is more prominent on the right side of the face. This has not happened to me before. I am planning on taking an OTC antiallergic to calm the symptoms.

A week after vaccine, it hurt to touch my eye - I thought I had pink eye but it wasn&#39;t itchy. I treated it with hot compress. I did that at least 3 times a day for two days. It was really swollen  - lower eye lid of my left eye - right in the middle of it - on the inside of the eyelid I can see a bump in the middle of it and so I was kind of pushing on my eye a little and it looked like fluid was coming out of my tear duct and so I put a hot compress on it often and it&#39;s getting a little better each day. I&#39;m 70% better.

                                                About 45 minutes after receiving my Covid vaccine I noticed my lower lip started to swell there was no swelling in my throat). I took Benadryl. I needed to continue taking the Benadryl every 4 - 6 hours because the swelling kept coming back. Later I noticed my lungs getting scratchy. I started using my nebulizer to stay ahead of it. I took two Benadryl before going to sleep. When I woke up I noticed my lips starting swell up again and my lungs were still scratchy. I took my peak flow and it have dropped to 345 (my normal is about 375/380). I contacted my Pulmonologist and her recommended that I go to Urgent Care and report my reaction to the CDC. I went to the Urgent Care. The doctor told me to continue with the Benadryl and nebulizer treats and she also added Pepcid and Prednisone.   It is now one week out and I am still experiencing the lip swelling and itchiness on my face  so I am still currently taking the Benadryl. From time to time my lungs my lungs feel scratchy.

                                                My left arm started to sting immediately after getting the shot, then the stinging subsided.  My left arm started to hurt later in the day and I had pain all the way down my left arm and left side of my chest. This pain throughout my left side was not helped by Ibuprofen and  made sleep very hard.  I had intermittent sharp pain in my neck, shoulder, and left arm for days.  The injection site turned red, hot, and a raised area the size of a silver dollar appeared  and was med-red in color for about 8 days.  The color is better/ almost normal as of today, but still a hard lump under the skin and a bit itchy.  This has caused pain throughout my back and shoulders since I got the shot....but it has not been activity limiting.  I had a slight bit of nausea for a couple of days as well.  My husband had his shot just after mine and experienced  Chills , headache, and nausea at about 9:00 P.M.  His chills subsided at about 3:00 A.M.  He continued with the headache for another day/ fatigue for 2 days/ and nausea for about 5 days.  He has also had tingling in his left arm (about 7 days)  and a funny tingling on his tongue for about a week.

                                                Prior to receiving her COVID-19 vaccine, the patient was already having symptoms from anxiety/nervousness about the vaccine. Patient was given her injection and within 1-2 minutes, she began feeling dizzy and lightheaded. The vaccine administrator came to me (pharmacist on duty) to notify me that she was not feeling well. I went to go check on her and she stated that she felt as though she was going to faint. I advised her to stay seated, asked if she would like an ice pack and water, and stepped out to get those for her while remaining vigilant (because I wanted to be in the same room as her for observation/safety). I brought her the ice pack, she held it on her chest and head and said it felt nice. After about a minute I stepped out again to ask a technician to get a water for her. When I came back, the patient was still seated but had a blank stare and her mouth was slightly open. I repeated her name out loud and nudged her shoulder several times, however the patient was unresponsive completely. I immediately looked for the red emergency kit in the consultation room but did not see one (I later found out that there was an EpiPen on the table in the room, but I did not see it at the time due to the urgency of the situation). I rushed back into the pharmacy, told the technicians to call 911, and took an EpiPen off the shelf in the pharmacy. I ran back into the room and the patient&#39;s face was very red, her eyes were bulging slightly, and it looked like she was trying to reach her hand up or move it, but was unable to. I injected her with the EpiPen immediately, and within roughly 5 seconds she came back to consciousness and looked at me and said &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34;. EMS arrived extremely fast and was there a few minutes after using the EpiPen. She was then taken by ambulance to the hospital. Patient had a friend, with her at the store who was scheduled to receive the vaccine as well, but after the incident she decided otherwise. Later that evening I gave patient&#39;s friend a phone call to check and see how patient was doing, and to also let her know that patient&#39;s vaccination card was at the pharmacy if she wanted to pick it up. That evening around 6:30-7pm, patient&#39;s husband came to the pharmacy to get her card, he updated us that she was being discharged from the hospital and that she was okay.

Symptoms was severe on Saturday 4/10. Benadryl could not control hives. Went to urgent care because hives were so severe and causing body ache.

                                                I was the first J&amp;J vaccine patient on April 1 @1pm at the pharmacy.  I developed a bruise around the injection site (like a bull&#39;s eye) afterwards and I still have it on my arm though slightly lighter but still visible.  I wonder if it is related to blood clotting that&#39;s been reported in the news lately.  I thought I&#39;d report it just in case.  I also had a small itchy rash of tiny red dots for about 3 days which started about 4 days post injection.  I have no previous issues with vaccinations or any bleeding concerns.  This is odd.  I developed alternating low grade fever ~99.1 F and chills with fatigue for 2 days after the jab too but that&#39;s not unusual for me after the seasonal flu vaccines.

About 15 hours after the vaccine, I still had the headache, nausea,  dizzy,  and additional slight diarrhea, dry heaves, rapid heartbeat, and feeling very tired  and weak but went from chills to hot and sweating.   This lasted for about an hour and then it was back to body chills, headache, nausea, body fatigue for the next 24 hours.   My arm and injection site did not hurt, only if I would rub across that area of my arm.   I have still experienced the fatigue 60 hours after the vaccine.  Nausea has still come on different time during this time too.

Thankfully, for a much shorter duration.   Symptoms were managed with OTC Extra Strength Tylenol.

Took Tylenol at 4 am.  Did not take anything else since.  Fever subsided in low  99&#39;s throughout that day. No other symptoms.  4-10-21 Woke up fine, no fever. Went to work at 7 am.  Toward end of work day, vaccination site became sore and I felt out of sorts.  4-11-21 Woke up fine, no fever. Went to work at 7 am. By noon, feeling foggy. Very sore throughout my body, especially upper body and vaccination site. 4-12-21 Woke up ok, no fever but not quite myself. Went to work 7 am. At about 8 am began to feel a bit foggy , dizzy and almost past out. Blood pressure taken by medics was normal but high for me, after resting  for 15 minutes it had gone done to my normal.  Went back to work station sitting  down but the foggy &amp; dizziness continued off and on. Went back to my hotel to rest at 1 pm. While resting felt better but when moving out of bed sensations would come back. Some pain in left side vaccination and shoulder/neck pain but that may be related to chronic issues. 4-13-21 Stayed home to rest, fogginess continues, pain in vaccination site down arm.

                                                Was stressed and run down in weeks prior to shot (taking care of mother dying of cancer who passed 04//01/21) so was not able to determine if experiencing side effects of just continued fatigue. Sore arm, bruised. Monday evening 04/12/21 felt sick, nauseous. Unusual for me. Continuing to feel sick each day since then and called in sick to work today. When I move around I feel worse. My chest feels like I am on the verge of getting really sick. I can breathe but just do not feel good. Feel worse when having a conversation with people. Feel better resting. I have no fever. My blood pressure and heart rate are normal. This is the sickest I have felt since before the pandemic. I called a nurses hotline yesterday and was told to call 911 is I had chest discomfort. I do not feel sick enough to call 911 and could drive myself if I need to go to the hospital. Best way to describe my symptoms is feel like I am on the verge of getting a bad chest cold. Had a headache last night and did not take anything. Woke up in the middle of the night with a very painful headache and took 2 Tylenol which made the headache subside. I have been feeling worse each day since Monday. Today is Thursday. Am wondering if I have COVID-19 and have called a clinic to schedule a COVID test that will be paid for by my work. Am waiting for a return call. All I know is that I feel sick and was not feeling this way before having the vaccine.

The red rash continued for three days.     I had not eaten any different foods, nor had I gone anywhere out of my house , and did not have any visitors, since I had the J&amp;J vaccine.

I did not receive food on the &#43;5 hr flight and was dehydrated. I stretched etc as normal, with no results. At 2am, I went to the salt water pool and went between the pool and hot tub for about an hour. The next day I saw a huge bruise on the back of my right leg, above the knee. This repeated for 4 more nights, although less severe. Each morning I woke with another bruise: right leg above the knee = 3 bruises (purpuras), (con&#39;t below)

This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This spontaneous report received from a patient concerned a 58-year-old female who experienced stroke-like symptoms and occluded vertebral artery 15 days after vaccine. Past medical history included vertebral dissection of right vertebral artery in 2000, hiatal hernia, chemotherapy, radiation, vertebral tear, 5 years of cancer drugs and stroke-like symptoms, and concurrent conditions included 2 times breast cancer survivor. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid, and pravastatin. On day 12 after vaccine, the patient woke up with left side stroke-like symptoms. The patient went to emergency room on day 15 and discharged on same day. On day 19, the patient had computed tomography scan and showed occluded right Vertebral artery. The patient had a computed tomography scan one year ago and there was no occlusion. She was discharged and evaluated by stroke neurologist. There is no report of thrombocytopenia to suggest thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Given the pre-existing history of vertebral artery dissection, there is a plausible alternative explanation for the event.

Got in car and started to have face swell up and get red all over. Went back into vaccine site and told them I was having a reaction. They observed my red face and puffiness and gave me 2 benadryl . My neck was feeling tight and red as well. I stayed there another 30 minutes, and it didn&#39;t get worse and stayed the same. They told me to keep taking benadryl for 2 days plus an over the counter 24 hour allergy pill. Also they directed me to go to the hospital if it got worse.  I took the benadryl  as directed and it stayed about the same for a day. Then slowly got better with a few flare ups within the first week.

On the 4th day I woke up with stiffness in my left arm and underarm, and swollen glands. I went to the urgent care on the following morning, but the stiffness and swelling had started to retreat and has since disappeared. Soreness at the injection site for about two weeks after vaccine. It is still a bit tender to the touch, but does not bother me unless rubbed hard. There was also redness and tenderness and some itching at the injection site. I felt poorly enough (the fatigue, mostly), that I was not able to work for 10 days. At about the two week mark I finally had the feeling that I felt good!  I occasionally feel fatigued, but have been able to resume normal activities.

                                                I woke up the 2nd day after recieving the Janssen Vaccine with a stiff neck and my shoulder hurt. I thought that I slept wrong. The pain did not go away that day or any day after that. My whole arm started hurting, and tingling. My neck hurt and my shoulder hurt severely.     It&#39;s been 3 weeks agl that I had gotten the vaccine, and it all still hurts. My whole arm is swollen, and there&#39;s a big bump swelling at the injection site of my left arm.  I went to my doctor on 6/14/2021. He ordered Xrays and gave me a muscle relaxer, and an extended release medicine like aleve.  The medicine did not help at all so I went back to the clinic. He perscribed Tramadal 50mg. and it helps a small amount but doesn&#39;t really help that much. He ordered an Ultrasound.

                                                Strange, prickly, itchy rash on my lower left side. And then it eventually it progressed to the middle of my back and partially to the right side. So that was the localized area. I had my dermatologist look at it. Then she saw that it looked like I had a rash on my chest, too. I didn&#39;t have itchiness there, though. And then she gave me betamethasone valerate (steroid ointment) and I applied that twice a day for three days. That seemed to clear that up. The itchiness went away. Nothing else in my lifetime had changed at that time other than the vaccine. The rough area of my skin on my left side feels normal again, too.

And then about midweek, I was starting to walk downstairs at work and I had to grab onto rails so I wouldn&#39;t fall - had become so dizzy. I tried to get into my regular doctor -  he was full until April 5. I went into walk-in clinic - I  had to grab onto a board there (dizzy) and they told me to get to ER. My heart was rapid heart beat by time I got to ER. They had to give me wheelchair so I wouldn&#39;t fall over to go into the ER room. Horrible bruising on wrist - because the first IV didn&#39;t take. They gave me a bag of fluids - and gave me Meclizine to help dizziness subside and two Tylenols for headache. I&#39;m taking 3  (per day)- 25 mg chewable HCI Meclizine. If symptoms aren&#39;t as bad I just take a half of one. Still needing the medication because I still have the pressure in the ear comes up and I need to take the Meclizine and Benadryl to get the pressure to go down.

My finger tips on my left arm went numb, same arm where I received the shot.  By the time I got home  I had a headache, so I took some tylenol.   My mouth is dry on and off. They told me to drink water and Gatorade  I slept for about 5 hours. I feel better but I still have a dry mouth.  The next morning my arm was swollen and itchy around the injection. I used an ice pack for the swelling.  About 24 hours later I was sweating on and off and my headache continued. I took another tylenol. And my body muscles were hurting.  I did not see a physician during any of the episodes.  It&#39;s the morning of March 23rd and I feel okay today.

                                                Had mild flu like symptoms from 6 to 12 hours after injection, then 24 hours of lethargy.  After that felt fine.  Then late afternoon on 3/22/21 got skin rash on both arms, took 1 Benadryl, seemed to help/clear a bit.  Next day in afternoon, rash appeared on both upper thighs, lower buttocks, arms; few hours later some clearing of upper thighs/buttocks, but then rash appeared on inner thighs and calves.  Took 2 Benadryl and used hydrocortisone cream on rash.  Nose looked red. Overnight rash spread to ankles and feet.  It feels like rash is moving around my body - other than stomach, upper back and neck.  This morning 03/24, feet have cleared, but still on inner thigh left leg.  Right leg is almost clear.   I have photos if needed.

That evening she was taken to the Cath Lab and had an IVC filter placed. The next day patient began to have paresthesias and discoloration of the right lower extremity.  Ultrasound showed high-grade occlusion of the right proximal superficial femoral artery.  Patient was pre-treated with platelets and  taken back to Cath Lab emergently.  In addition to the right SFA there is also thrombotic occlusion of bilateral iliacs.  Patient had bilateral thrombectomy and bilateral common iliac stent placement. The following day developed gross hematuria.

Larger veins were visible at the surface, pronounced, raised in a ridge about the size of my finger...at least 6-8 veins across each thigh.  There were literally waves of swollen flesh. Very unusual, in fact, the way they looked was very scary. There was no pain or aching at the time. I elevated legs, iced them, took a diuretic for the next 3 days and they eventually deflated. Following few days had aching from waist down. Nothing since.

About 6 hours later, body pain, chills, body temperature dis-regulation (hot/cold/sweaty) throughout the night. At approximately 10:30 a.m. (approx. 20 hours post injection) I was standing at the kitchen counter getting some water, still experiencing extreme fatigue and body pain, about 4 hours after a dose of Extra Strength Tylenol, and had some kind of weird event where I began to feel faint and before I knew it, my body began convulsing (large shakes) and the next thing I knew I was seated on the kitchen floor and my husband was asking me &#34;what happened&#34;. It never happened again and we decided an ambulance was not necessary. But I thought to report it because this kind of thing is not on the &#34;the list&#34; of expected side effects.

She felt &#34;crumby&#34; on Saturday.  Today she no longer feels the burning sensation, but has a 1/2&#34; ring around injection site that is swollen and bruised. She also reported feeling a knot under her skin.  She did not seek medical attention and was quite embarrassed that she cried after her injection.

                                                My shoulder area became very sore 8 days after the injection (no symptoms prior).  It felt like I&#39;d torn a muscle and couldn&#39;t lift my arm above my head or use it to carry or lift items.  It got sorer through the weekend so Sunday morning I applied Chinese cups to the area (I&#39;m a licensed massage therapist) and the whole shoulder area (4 cups) turned dark purple - I&#39;ve never experienced so big of an area turn purple.  It relieved a little but Monday I went to see a neurological chiropractor which relieved some.  On Sunday and Tuesday I took 800 mg/ibuprofen which seemed to help relieve some of the pain.

Went to bed to sleep it off.  Woke up and the headache was gone the next morning.  Have not had any more headaches.  Experienced muscle soreness in arm of injection and at the injection spot.  Then whole body muscle soreness/heaviness began on April 5th for 3 days.  I had swelling in both legs for only one day, on April 12th. First day I noticed I was experiencing shortness of breath was April 6th.  Became out of breath walking a small incline.  Shortness of breath continues to current, April 16th, perhaps a bit worse, where I seem that a natural breath requires a bit of work. So far, I have no

                                                At 23 hours post Johnson and Johnson vaccination, I began to have a 10/10 headache (which was the worst headache of my life), nausea and severe aura. I then became extremely confused and was taken to the emergency department by my husband. The following was reported to me the next day when I awoke in the ICU at Hospital: within an hour of arriving at the ED, I exhibited a progressive hyperactive delirium, agitation, slurred speech (word salad), combativeness, confabulation, word finding difficulties and an inability to follow commands. The neurologist in the ED said that she was seeing this adverse vaccination side effect in other patients at the 24-hour period. I received Haldol, Zyprexa, and Ativan to control the delirium and received a head CT angiogram in the ED, which was normal. I was transferred by ambulance to the main hospital due to acute metabolic encephalopathy/altered mental status. I was admitted to the neurological unit whereby I became critically hypotensive (60s over 30s) and was transferred to the ICU due to persistent hypotension unresponsive to IV normal saline. I was then transferred and admitted to the ICU and was given continued IV fluid resuscitation and Levophed vasopressor. I was eventually weaned from vasopressors and was discharged back home in three days exhausted, bruised, fatigued and with continuous clouded mentation. I have been told by all of the doctors that this was a vaccination side-effect, which caused cerebritis. I was subsequently treated as an outpatient at Hospital for intractable aura with IV Valporic Acid, Magnesium, and Lasix infusion on April 1, 2021.

                                                Immediately that evening, I started to get headachy and nauseous. My arm in the injection site was very sore. The next morning, the other arm was sore. It was difficult for me to raise my arms above my head without feeling extremely weak. I couldn&#39;t lift anything above my head for the fear I would drop them. Knee replacement surgery on both knees about 4 years ago - I felt pain in my knees; all my joints; all of my teeth; my vision was blurry. My head hurt so badly. Tylenol dulled the headache and joint pain but it didn&#39;t help it to go away. My chest also hurt quite a bit. I felt extremely lethargic.  I didn&#39;t feel like getting out of bed. I could only get the  meals  made (I&#39;m a caregiver for my mom and mother-in-law) and then get back into bed. I usually walk five miles a day. I&#39;m still not there yet ( to walk that much) but I&#39;m getting better. The nausea lasted until the 17th. The headache just left finally on April 23. The body aches, teeth ache and joints subsided around the 17th also. The blurry vision - I still have a a little bit of that but it&#39;s starting to improve. The weakness in the arm - that is starting to improve - I do still feel kind of weak when I raise my arms above my head. The fatigue I still have but I&#39;m feeling a bit of improvement.  I have to keep checking my bed to see if I accidentally put the massage setting on (and I hadn&#39;t) because my body was shaking  in entire  body- That started on the second day after the vaccine and stopped about the 19th. I called to the advice nurse to register my health complaint and she had me come in for a full workup. And she asked me to go to ER. They kept me in the ER overnight.

                                                When I received the injection, I experienced a sharp intense burning pain which shot up my shoulder, neck and behind my ear. This has never happened before. My shoulder/arm were sore for approximately one week which seemed typical to how I respond to a vaccine. After a week I began experiencing a sharp pain in my neck and shoulder area which has gradually worsened to where I am now icing it multiple times per day. There is also numbness and tingling down my forearm and into my thumb and index finger.  The pain is unmanageable at times and I am unable to get a full nights rest and have near constant pain when keyboarding.

Since 3/09/2021, the pain has increased in the exact spot of the vaccine, a painful sharp pierce feeling, some days a punch,  sometimes feels like a bee sting, usually worse like a sharp precise pain.  My Dr. has validated it is not my bursa or tendinitis, the pain is 24x7, I am unable to lay on my left arm.  Have noticed substantial muscle degradation in my left arm.  Taking anti-inflamatory over the counter medication, e.g., Aleve, provides no help.

                                                9 hours after the vaccination, I woke with seizure like sub-0 chills where I where I felt like I was lying in the snow without clothes on.  Very hard shaking. Put on flannel pj&#39;s and wool socks, but could not get warm.  The violent shaking lasted about 3 hours. Along with what felt like 12 migraines at the same time.  My forehead was very hot, but that could have been from my hand being so cold.  My thermometer battery was dead.  The next morning, and for almost a week, I felt very lethargic as if I were watching myself from outside my body, hard to drive and focus, head felt like a giant bruise and I was incredibly tired. The tiredness has never gone away and I feel weaker every day here two (2) months later.

Two weeks later arm still hurt with limited mobility so I called the pharmacy that sponsored the clinic for advice.  He said to take Tylenol and call PCP if not better in a week.  Gave it two more weeks and called PCP.  Went to ortho yesterday.  Arm still sore when lifting overhead, undressing and when first waking up.

Gave me Levofloxacin and it seemed to clear it up.  June  24 I got a high fever of 101.5.  Went to Immediate Care and another UTI.  Due to the fact I started itching at the end of the last treatment, decided to try Myobic.  Had a fever for 4 more days and it finally it cleared up.

I went to the eye doctor that said I have fast growing cataracts, The doctor did say this is not an age related cataracts this is a fast growing cataracts.
