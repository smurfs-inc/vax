It?s now a very hard lump that is the largest it?s been .  I?ve been treating with prescription triderm and it is helping some but when I tried clobetasol the opposite happened and it aggravated  the site.  This redness , itching, swelling and warm to the touch has been going on since Sunday evening  and it is not Wednesday night and doesn?t look better yet.

It was not itchy, but it was warm to the touch.  7:45pm on 3-14-21  My butt cheeks were bright red and warm to the touch.  Then about 30 minutes later my thighs became red.  Everything red started itching was raised like hives.  I found three dots on my arm and later those spread into large spots of hives.  Then over the next 9 hours, a new spot would start, it would spread, then it would itch like crazy.  I took 25mg of Diphenhydramine at 8pm.  I took another 50mg at 10 when I was having no relief and it continued to spread.  At 1:15am both of my hands and wrists had hives and these hurt and itched the most because they were swollen and hard to bend.  At 3am both of my feet started to flair up.  Finally around 5am the hives stopped.  I was not able to sleep through it.  I did not ever have a fever, I checked that 4 times.  I also did not have trouble breathing or have any swelling on my face. 3-15-21 @ 9:20am I went to see my doctor.  All of my vitals were good.  All of my hives were gone.  He put me on Prednisone in case it came back and at 11am I took 4 pills and went to bed.  I woke up 2 hours later and my feet were itching again.  My left foot broke out in hives bad.   It lasted for over an hour.  My toes were hard to bend.   4:34pm on 3-15-21 currently I don&#39;t have any hives and I am tired.    I thoroughly thought through everything that I have eaten, worn, and used, and I have changed nothing over the past 2 weeks.

                                                About 6 hours after receiving the shot I started experiencing  skin sensitivity (common when I feel ill), chills, aches in my legs and a slight headache. The chills subsided after about 2 hours, but then my resting heart rate went up to 110-120 bpm rather than the normal 75-85 for me. It felt like my heart was beating out of my chest even though I was laying down in bed. That lasted through the night and I felt back to normal around mid-morning.

After no side effects, I drove away.  Only to have a sudden reaction as I was driving.  I&#39;ve felt dizzy with flu vaccines before and have felt the same symptoms as with the covid vaccine when IV dye was injected for a CT scan 5 months ago.  Felt faint/ dizzy, Got severe tachycardia, thought my heart was gonna explode.  I drove back in a hurry, scared and confused. I was waiting to be seen, and no one ever came out.  Symptoms subsided on their own after 15 min, therefore I just left without notifying anyone.  2 hours after vaccine, my arm looked moderately red and swollen, with minimal pain.  7 hours after getting the vaccine I started with chills and body aches.  8 hours after getting the vaccine I felt feverish and malaise.  After taking Tylenol with feverish symptoms (didn&#39;t check temp) slept for 2 hours and felt a little better.

                                                I felt light headedness right away. The night that I got the injection, I felt kind of drunk. I felt like I had too much alcohol. I am very sensitive to things. I felt silly - loose - tired.  In the night, I had aches and chills - no fever. The next day I felt achy and really really tired. I had a pain at the injection site. That evolved into a left side migraine (the achiness and fatigue and pain from shot) It created tension up my arm and up my neck - and I did get nausea with the headache - on Saturday. Sunday, I felt a little bit better but energy was still low - unusual tiredness; couldn&#39;t exercise as I felt a heavy fatigue. On Sunday, I went to a dance class but it was difficult as I was tired. On Monday, I felt a tiny bit better but still fatigued and did another dance class which went a little better. On Monday evening, I felt like I did the night of the injection - a little loopy and &#34;drunk like.&#34; Monday night, I woke up with a Fiery, achy, itchy, burning rash on both of my arms and the tops of my legs. If I would itch it, it would exaggerate it. When I woke up the next day - the rash went everywhere in my body - it would come and go in different places - neck, face, down and up my legs and feet and on my butt. Pretty much every spot had the rash at one time or another. It was really bad on Tuesday morning, I called the doctor. Was treated with Benadryl and cortisone cream which helped with the symptoms. Tuesday night, it was excruciating - it was all up and down my legs, arms, neck and face and stomach and rear end and feet. It was very achy, burning and itchy - very intense. It would hurt if I scratched it. Accompanied with really intense fatigue. Wednesday, after taking Benadryl, I woke up and it was a tiny bit better. It was still on my legs, neck and face. Sometimes my arms would flare up and sometimes they wouldn&#39;t. Any kind of exertion - like my dance class - would trigger the rash - so I took a break from exercising that week.  It started getting incrementally better - very slowly. Still there on Thursday - still fatigued and I was still taking Benadryl. Friday, also. Saturday, it was pretty much gone but it would threaten to come back and I felt itchiness in my legs when I went for a walk. It still feels a little lingering - my legs are itchy. I&#39;m still building back my energy. Incrementally my energy is increasing. Still not 100% there but it&#39;s getting better day by day.  Note: My history with my skin: I do get flare ups when I get bug bites and when I get poison ivy - I have very sensitive skin.

                                                In addition to the known side effects of extreme fatigue, low grade fever and body aches, I also have right arm pain at the site of injection with right arm swelling, warmth and right axilla swelling and tenderness.  The arm pain was began immediately at the time of injection and did initially lessen some for the first 12 hours until it started worsening mid-morning 22-24 hours after the injection.  Around 26 hours after the injection the arm pain worsened such that it couldn&#39;t be ignored and the axilla pain became very prominent almost worse than the arm pain.  Upon inspection I noticed obvious swelling and pain in my right axilla.  The right arm and axilla pain has persisted and worsened over the last 2 days to now include upper biceps, upper triceps, lower deltoid, trapezius, clavicular and right lateral breast pain.  The axilla and arm swelling has persisted and worsened over the last two days to now include swelling in my upper arm, around my clavicle, my upper chest and upper back.  The initial axilla swelling has not decreased any and is more prominent than any of the swelling located elsewhere.  Of note, I cannot easily palpate any axilla, clavicular or cervical lymph nodes.  If there is lymp involvement the nodes are not appearing to be extremely swollen with palpation exam.

I tried to sleep it off, but woke up with my heart racing- My resting BPM was around 120. My skin was super sensitive. I started taking 2 extra strength Tylenol every 6 hours around 5pm, and that helped a little. I couldn&#39;t focus on anything- I could basically stare at the wall while my heart was hammering. I finally slept, and woke up soaked in sweat with my fever broken (my fever never got above 99) around 2am, and improved steadily after that.

                                                pt was fine until 15 minutes into her waiting time at which she stated she felt faint and light headed.  Continued to worsen based on dialogue with patient.  Tried to take blood pressure manually as well as with automated cuff but too low to detect.  Pt stated she felt tingly all over, hot , clammy, dizzy and was made worse by opening her eyes.  Put ice packs on neck and forehead as well as wet cloth.  Pt requested water but we declined as to not knowing severity or extent of reaction yet.  Based upon pt not improving and lack of palpable pulse decision to involve EMS was made.  Upon ems arrival 10 min later pt was taken to their transport vehicle for further evaluation.   At that time they observed vitals to be normal, monitored for additional 10-15 minutes and determined pt had adverse reaction, not allergic reaction.  Pts caregiver called us to let us know she was fine on drive home and improved rapidly en route.  Noted pt drove 2-3 hours for appointment, in convertible with temps in mid -upper 70&#39;s and noted she was possibly hot upon arrival and this could have precipitated reaction to injection.

                                                My vaccine was administered at 12:30pm. I waited until 12:55 at CVS after the vaccine to make sure there were no reactions. I also move my arm around a lot after the injection to keep it from hurting. I drove home, at lunch and about 2:45 was hit with a very noticeable headache. I never get headaches and eat healthy and consume about a gallon of water a day. I knew it wasn&#39;t from dehydration or being hungry.  Headache was in the temple area and made my eyes hurt in the same way they would if you had cried for an extended period of time or were overtired. At 3pm a wave of exhaustion hit me. I was sitting working trying to combat the headache and felt almost wiped out. I got through the rest of my work day (4:30) and went to lay down immediately. I passed out almost instantly until 7 pm. I work up and showered, ate dinner and started to feel a little warm. It should be noted it was an unseasonably warm day and got up to 77, so it was a tiny bit warm in my home. I put on loose fitting clothes and slayed on the couch still with the bad headache and the injection site started to throb so I placed and ice pack on for 20 minutes. I could only stay awake until 8:45 and got in bed. I could not get comfortable for several hours feeling very warm. I tried a fan on high and drinking more water but i felt very warm like how you feel with the flu. I took my temp at 1130pm it was normal. I continued to toss and turn and feel very warm and slightly dizzy, in the sense that I hadn&#39;t been able to sleep and with the headache my body was just exhausted. Around 2 am i woke up for more water and got in the shower because I had sweated so much my sheets were wet and my clothes. I got out of the shower around 10 minutes later, changed and got new sheets and got back in bad. Around 330 I felt very hot again and opened the windows and got another ice pack for my arm which was throbbing again. I finally fell asleep after 3:45am. I got up for work at 6am. I felt slightly foggy, and very hot. But no fever. My temp is normally around 97.4-97.9 and it was 98.4. Still normal but I was running warmer than usual. It took a long time to get ready and despite hot water in the shower I was freezing. i got dress and debated going to work. Got in the car at 6:45 and my drive to work is 30 minutes. 1/2 way into my drive I got very sweaty again and went home to change my clothes because they were too warm. Got to work around 7:20 and still felt warm but they take our temps at the door and min was still okay, no fever. I drank a lot of water and ate, and at 8:30 am all of a sudden the exhaustion was gone and I felt normal. I got home form work at 5:30p and took a 3 hour nap and felt normal again.

                                                The day after the vaccination, 3/16, I noticed red irritated skin on the back of my right hand and wrist.  It did not itch or feel irritated, just noticed that it was red and thought I might have scratched it on something.  The next day, 3/17, I woke up to see that the irritated area now had blisters and I felt a burning sensation in that area.  I also noticed a few of the red patches and one blister on the underside of my right forearm.   I took Benedryl which seemed to help with the burning feeling. Today, 3/18, it now is less red, but the blisters are still present.  It does not burn and I have not taken any more medication for it.

                                                Low back pain began about 6 hours after shot.  Next morning, 12 hours after shot, woke with muscle aches, headache, chills and sweating.  Approximately 18 hours after shot, hives began to appear at wrists, thighs.  About the same time, diarrhea occurred twice, and severe dizziness occurred.  Likely brief loss of consciousness occurred, resulting in fall due to sudden dizziness upon standing.  Hives became progressively worse, became severe and full-body.  Called doctor, who instructed us to go to ER for IV steroids and additional care.

The allergy meds helped but once they wore off I would start itching. Two days after the shot my face got really puffy especially around the eyes. For six days I took 2 Zyrtec in the morning and 1 benadryl at night. After 6 days of the allergy meds I finally was back to normal.

She woke up, Down&#39;s syndrome, and her sister-in-law saw that she was white faced, and looked like she was going to throw up, but said that she was achy and nauseous.  She has swelling to the injection site, a small dot.  She feels a little warm, but no fever, 97.9.  Has not taken anything for her symptoms.

With history of panic attacks we observed closely.  After 25 minutes, and symptoms getting worse, we decided it was best to administer epi-pen and called 911.  Symptoms got a bit better after a minute. After about 7 minutes another epi-pen was administered as symptoms were starting to get worse again.

                                                Started with chills shortly after getting the injection, which got progressively worse. At 9:30 pm, the evening of injection, chills got worse, along with a headache and muscle aches that started with my shoulders and moved quickly down my body, eventually, ending at my toes. It hurt to move, even my fingers. I took 2 regular strength Tylenol, which helped get me to sleep. I then woke up around 4 am in a puddle of sweat... I took my temp and no fever, but body aches, headache and chills were still prevalent. I spent the next day in bed without moving or eating much - drank a lot of water. Tylenol every six hours. An hour after taking Tylenol, I seemed to be well enough to not be moaning and groaning, but it wore off too quickly and I had two hours of feeling horrible before taking more Tylenol for a bit of relief. I woke Sunday morning around 5 am in another puddle of sweat and severe body aches and headache. I took more Tylenol, went back to sleep and woke around 9 am feeling groggy, but quickly realized that I was feeling 100% better! Just like that. I also had pain at the injection site that for some reason seems to be getting worse today, Sunday (April 4). I do not have swelling or redness. It just feels hot and very very sore and getting worse. Heavy and hard to lift.

                                                Started pretty immediately with feeling overheated like a wave of heat then started feeling unwell or not right then my right hand went numb that was about five minutes after the shot. Told the nurses they took me back in a room took my vitals at that time I started to feel weak like my arms and legs were Jell-O or jelly. I also felt jittery the nurses gave me apple juice and crackers they put me in a private room they check my vitals again my heart rate was elevated and my blood pressure also went up . 02 That?s normalsats normal My feet are they just started to feel numb as well. A doctor came in and checked me out they felt like my exam was normal but they also felt like I might be having a mild reaction around 1500 I started to get itchy but no hives noted I took a Benadryl 25 mg at 1500 around 1515 my feet were still numb but I definitely felt better still kind of felt like my arms and legs were weak but not as bad so after an hour and a half I was allowed to leave and was told to rest for the rest The day and you call or go to the emergency room if I had trouble some side-effects about four hours after the shot  my lips did start tingling at home I did check my oxygen saturations and it was normal I look at my lips to make sure that they weren?t swelling the only thing I noticed was that a scar I have on my lip that usually you can?t see was more prominent and you could actually see it my lower back hurts a lot

Within the next few hours the symptoms became increasingly worse, but not different other than the addition of a headache. I took 2 Tylenol to help with the headache and fever. Overnight sleep was difficult due to chills, sweats, fever dreams and aches. The symptoms lessened the next day (24-hours post injection), but still included muscle/body aches, headache, and extreme fatigue. Again took 2 Tylenol to help. Today (48-hours post injection) I&#39;m feeling quite a bit better although still not 100%. Soreness at injection site persists, especially when lifting my arm.

                                                We had a vaccine reaction today at pharmacy 1870. Patient signed up vaccine online.   I saw on her form that she had a reaction to vaccine. , and discussed the vaccine reaction with her.  She said she had hives to influenza vaccine five years ago, but had influenza vaccines every year since including 2020 without incident.        I gave her the vaccine (Janssen) and almost immediately she said she felt tingling in her arm.  I had her sit in site of my gatekeeper for the vaccines.  In less than 5 minutes, she was swelling and red in the arm and it crossed over to her chest neck and the other arm.  She asked for a benadryl tablet and we complied, but the swelling continued to get worse. We immediately called 911 and the paramedics arrived in about 5 minutes. They gave her iv benadryl and transported her to hospital for observation.  Employee followed up with patient this afternoon.  She had been released from hospital and is doing well.  She was very pleased that we called to ask about her well-being.

                                                Day of vaccine, I felt like my lymph nodes were swollen. Two days later the injection site started to get deep red. Friday I started to about an inch of so, swell up some. Saturday I had a rash on my arm by the injection site, the top part on my bicep was pretty red and swollen. I didn&#39;t take my Humara or Zolar injection. On Sunday the rash got worse and grew in size and really hot to touch, the pain was radiating all the way to my wrist and hurt really bad causing pain when I moved my wrist. It was hard for me to go to sleep so I called the dr and went in . The dr. said it looked less red that what it was and told me to take Ibuprofen 800mg* 3x day.  The pain is now in both wrist and hard for to grip stuff and a little hot to touch.  You can see the difference in the skin tone where the rash was, it looks bruised.

                                                about eight hours after receiving the injection, I started to feel strong aching in my muscles and joints (most strongly felt in neck, hands, jaw, inner ear, but also including legs and feet).  I also felt chills.  My temperature was 98.8 F.  Over the course of the next three or four hours, I have felt strong sensations of aching and throbbing in my chest, back, hands, inner ears, and neck.  I also felt pins and needles all over but most strongly in chest, back, hands, inner ears, and sides of my neck.

                                                Patient received her vaccine at 11:30 AM.  Immediately after receiving the Jansen vaccine, the patient reported feeling lightheaded as she stood up.  She sat in our waiting area for about 10 minutes, and reported that she felt as though her tongue was swelling.  We contacted EMS at this point, and provided a dose of Benadryl to the patient at her request.  We brought the patient into our vaccine room where she began to break out into hives.  She vomited several times.  EMS arrived shortly thereafter and checked to see if the patient was experiencing an allergic reaction.  EMS took the patient to the hospital.  At about 2 PM, the patient called the pharmacy to let us know that she was okay.  She said that it was confirmed as an allergic reaction at the hospital.  She indicated that she had received a steroid injection at the hospital and was feeling much better.  We encouraged the patient to call us at any time if she had any further problems or questions.

                                                I had a very bad case of Covid in January 2021 and have not regained my taste or smell.  I was in bed for 2 weeks and had a prolonged fever up to 105 degrees--so high that I had visual and auditory hallucinations.  I had hair loss in the following months and I also continue to be fatigued.    I received the vaccination on 4/6/21 around 11am; a slight headache and face flushing occurred about 30 minutes after shot, but generally felt ok.  Woke up at 4am on 4/7/21 with chills, extreme joint pain, body aches, migraine headache, and a fever of 101.5 degrees.  Took Tylenol around 6am and went back to bed.  The migraine headache, chills, body aches, and extreme joint pain continued.  I was dizzy and extremely fatigued.  Woke up around 9 am and fever was at 102.7 degrees.  Joint pain and headache were almost unbearable at this point and I took a hydrocodone.  Took temperature around 12 pm and it was 103.5 degrees.  Fever continued rising to 104.4 degrees at 2:30 pm.  Took another Tylenol and went to sleep.  The next day, my fever had fallen back down to 102.5 degrees.  I continued with Tylenol to control me fever to around 101 degrees.   My fever persisted for 3 days.  I still have extreme fatigue, joint pain, burning scalp (which will likely mean more hair loss), zero appetite and weight loss, dizziness, blurred vision, etc.  The side effects are exactly how i felt when I got Covid in January.

                                                Chills for about a half hour, fever reaching 102 degrees and headache lasting through the night. In the morning I took ibuprofen which brought the fever down and took care of the headache. The fever did not return, but I took another dose of ibuprofen about 5 hours after the first for a returning headache. Today is the 6th and the pain in my arm (injection site) is still fairly intense and especially to the touch.

                                                The injection site was really sore. Ran high fever and had flu like symptoms for about 15 hours. Then those symptoms stopped but the injection site pain continued. The intensity of the pain grew for about 3 weeks. Then pain extended to neck and shoulder blade. Went to urgent care  for the  arm/neck/shoulder pain. Took neck X-rays. Given a steroid shot and an another shot I think for inflammation. Prescribed a muscle relaxer.

Patient laid on the floor reporting a feeling of lightheadedness, dizzy, and had tingling in her bilateral hands. RN assessed patient. Patient vitals were taken, ice pack, water and crackers provided to patient. Patient denied any other symptoms at that time.

                                                Dizziness immediately following vaccine. Slight headache, moderate muscle aches, severe pain at injection site. It was also swollen with redness, itching, and it was hot. . Never had a fever. I immediately started taking Benadryl every 4 hours. I had really bad nausea (no vomiting)  to the point I was unable to eat and lost 7 lbs. I had really bad cold sweats so bad I was drenched with sweat multiple times a day for over a week. I ended up going to the walk in clinic about 5 days after the injection and was given Zofran for nausea.  I was also told I had a moderate allergic reaction to the vaccine and any other time they would start me on steroids but they said if I took steroids it would make the vaccine not work. So I was told to continue Benadryl and deal with it.  To this day which will be two weeks tomorrow since I received the shot I still have a hard hot lump in my arm, I still break out in cold sweats, and still have a little nausea.  Never had wheezing or issues breathing though.

After a few hours, the upper legs became red and itchy. It then affected my right arm, a little on my abdomen, and then the right elbow area. Benadryl, a cold shower, and icing the areas made the symptoms go away for several hours, but they returned over night at 3am.  Day 8, the symptoms were gone most of the day, but returned in the evening around 8pm. Benadryl taken and iced down the arms and legs.  Symptoms subsided.  They returned again at 3am and woke me from sleeping. It affected both feet, both legs, both arms, a little on my back and sides.

Patient voiced that she took Benadryl immediately and the reaction began to subside. The patient also stated that he woke up Saturday evening with a large sized knot on her arm where the vaccine was administered. Patient stated that it has since gone down in size but is still fairly large.

                                                Extreme fatigue.  Slept most of the time for two days.   Got shot at 10:40 AM.  Left Arm immediately felt odd---sore, heavy, tingly all the way down to my wrist.  By noon, I was asleep.  Slept for about 3 hours.  Up for 3 hours.  Slept for 3.  Up for 3.  Then slept all night.   I had a headache and slept most of the next day.  Definitely felt like my body was fighting something.     I have an approximately 3 inch diameter circle around injection site that is a red, swollen, hard, lump,  It is hot to the touch and extremely sore---at times it itches.  I am shocked how big and hard the knot is.  Its crazy!  I cannot put weight on that arm.  Extremely sore.  It is now 4 days after the vaccine and the knot does not seem to be getting smaller.  In fact, it may be bigger.

I said I wanted to give her benadryl and patient refused. Sat with patient and she reported no changes, just felt different and tingled a little. Patient stated that it did not feel like allergic reactions she has had in the past. Checked tongue and lips for swelling, no sign of anything like that or other signs of anaphylaxis. By the end of allotted 30 min waiting period, patient said she felt normal again. She stayed in the store for another 30 minutes and reported back that she was fine.

                                                Around 7 pm on 3/13, I developed brain fog, trouble walking, and then fever, severe muscle pain worse in legs, and chills.  Most of these symptoms seemed to improve on 3/14, but then on 3/15, I developed new onset of shortness of breath and chest discomfort.  On 3/16 around 1 pm the shortness of breath worsened and I went to the emergency room.  I felt that I couldn&#39;t take a deep breath in and I had chest discomfort on the left side of my chest worse when taking a deep breath.  My legs were hurting as well, especially my left leg.  I had sinus tachycardia (heart rate 106-120) and increased respiratory rate (rate of 20)  with O2 sats 100% on room air.   My breathing and heart rate improved somewhat with 1 liter oxygen therapy, 1 liter of IV fluids, albuterol inhaler, and decadron 6 mg orally.  It was thought that I had a delayed asthmatic/allergic reaction to the vaccine.  I do not have a history of asthma.  I was prescribed a Medrol dose pack and albuterol inhaler.  My hands and feet are very cold and tingling on 3/18.  Shortness of breath and chest pain seems to have improved but not completely gone as of the time of this submission on 3/18.

It was flat, round, pinkish in color and grew  about 2&#39; in diameter and was warm to the touch. By Sunday and today it was not as sore, but was still the same size and bruised.

                                                Left foot became tingly as if it had fallen asleep starting at around 8:00 pm the evening of the injection. I was sitting on the couch with my legs outstretched and crossed at the ankle in front of me. I thought it was because I had my legs crossed. I uncrossed them. The feeling did not go away. It is now the next day and the feeling is still present. I sit this way often and have never had this happen before. I assume it is due to the vaccine.  It is extremely weird to feel pins and needles constantly in your foot.

                                                As soon as the shot was administered in the deltoid muscle within 3 seconds my axillary node was on fire and I couldn&#39;t put my arm at rest.  Extremely painful in my armpit.  The injection nurse said that is not normal and gave me a sheet to report to the CDC scan code.  My entire left arm was on fire within a minute.  She had me sit for 30 minutes.  I had no other reaction.  My arm was subsiding a little bit to toleration.  I went home and rested, drank a ton of water.  I went to bed and woke up at 2 am in a cold sweat, I felt like I was freezing and could not stop shaking.  My teeth chattered.  My husband put on many blankets and helped me get warm.  He said I was burning up.  My muscles were so weak and painful, joints hurt and extreme head ache.  I took some Advil and he warmed me up.  My left arm was numb up my left side of my neck and my left cheek.  I took the day off work.  In addition, in the morning I felt like my left leg and foot had minor numbness and prickles.  I could walk but it was colder and prickled on the foot each step.  The next day I was 50% better and made it to work barely.  It took me 3 days to recover from the flu like symptoms.   My left arm continued to feel numb and had bouts of prickles and tingling.  The muscles were hard to use in my left arm and I really didn&#39;t use it at all.  Over the course of 2 weeks things have improved.  I still have not recovered feeling in my left pinky and ring finger.  They are weaker still today.  Every morning my left arm is numb for a little while (I don&#39;t sleep on my left side) but recovers to about 75% except my pinky and ring finger.  My left neck and cheek have a warming prickle feeling every morning for about a half hour.  They mostly wake up to entirety.  My L foot at the bottom has period/episodic prickles.   Daily my left arm is colder and is weaker than before.  I am a high school teacher so I don&#39;t have to use my left arm very much but it is causing pain and negative sensations and is reducing the amount of use of my left arm.

                                                I started having an annaphylaxis reaction a short time after i left. At first it was intense all over body itching that felt like it was from the inside out. By the time i got home i was getting red blotchy patches over my face, neck, and chest. I took benedryl which did nothing to subside the reaction. When my chest started feeling tight i went to the emergency room. My lips were itching and puffy. At the er  i received treatment for annaphylaxis once and about a half hour to forty minutes before i was to be discharge i had a reoccurance of symptoms and was treated for it a second time and admitted to the hospital. This was from the March 31st clinic held at the fire department.

                                                Got vaccine at 5:36 pm and during waiting time afterward, she reported around 5;53 pm having generalized tingling then followed by generalized pruritis. Denied and did not exhibit signs of urticaria, angioedema, cough, dyspnea, wheezing, CP, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, lightheadedness, weakness, pallor, tachycardia. Discussed giving her diphenhydramine and she agreed stating she had no previous adverse reaction to this treatment. At 5:56 pm, I gave diphenhydramine HCL 50 mg/ml 1 ml IM in her right deltoid muscle. Around the time of the injection (approximately 5:59 pm, pulse was 76, oxygen saturation 97%, BP 138/90, lungs clear, heart RRR. Within 20 minutes (6:22 pm) of diphenhydramine injection, she reported that the tingling had largely subsided (only remaining in lower legs) and her pruritis was improving. Her pulse was 77, oxygen saturation 96%, and BP 126/82 at that time. She also reported she had not developed any new symptoms (see above). By 6:28 pm, she reported no further tingling nor pruritis and feeling well. We released her at that time as we deemed her recovered from the symptoms. We advised her to call 9-1-1 if the symptoms returned especially with one or more of the above symptoms she had twice denied experiencing. 3/9/21 11:47 a.m. Called to check on status. No answer. Left message.

                                                My injection was on a Monday at 1pm. I had no issues for about a day and a half. On Wednesday afternoon I started having itching and redness on my forearms and top of both hands. Both arms on Wednesday evening were swollen, quite red and sore (a bit of a burning sensation). It almost feels like a bad sunburn at times. I took an antihistamine to help with the itching and swelling and this morning actually put calamine lotion on my arms to help soothe the burning feeling. It is more irritating that painful and nothing needing medical attention but I thought it should be reported.

                                                A bumpy itchy rash started first in my arms and after in wrists and hands so i took 2mg of betamethasone and after 45 minutes another tablet of 1 mg. After 2,5 hours the rash calmed down on the upper part but it started on legs, tighs and foot. I was on fire and to have a bit of relief i put a wet cloth on the skin and i took another tablet of 1 mg of betamethasone and 1 of benadryl allergy. Around 11 pm the rash stopped and the skin became normal. I slept with no problem, but the next morning after 20 minutes I woke up the rash started again in all the body so I took 2 mg of betamethasone and 1 benadryl allergy. I went to the vaccination center but there wasn&#39;t any doctor, only a nurse that told me to keep on taking antisthamine and corticosteroids.  It calmed down around 12 am and started again in the late afternoon.I took a benadryl, i used the wet cloth and around 10 pm stopped. Night with no problem, but around 9.30am the rash started again so i took 1 mg of betamethasone and 1 benadryl. Around 1 pm calmed down and at 2pm i took 2 benadryl. Around 8 pm i had some itchy spot on the legs but it didnt turn out in rash. Today after 30 minutes i woke up i had some spots on the legs, i took a benadryl and after 1 hour disappeared.

The rest of the day I had the normal symptoms- Pounding headache, nausea, horrible body aches (couldn?t lay down or stand to be comfortable).  That night around 11:45pm I got up to let my dog in and I started seeing small black dots- blurry vision.  I felt nauseas.  I ended up falling on the floor.  I was able to get up.  I then ended up waking up in the bathroom on the floor and had no idea how I had gotten there.  My hands were vibrating.  I called my husband from work to come help me up.  I was able to sleep and didn?t seek medical attention.  I am not sure if it was low blood pressure or what could have happened I have never experienced that before.  I did contact my doctor?s office this afternoon via (online) but haven?t had a response yet.  I have been in bed all day today.  - Body aches, nausea, pounding headache

                                                9pm - 7 hours after receiving the shot I was extremely itchy all over and took Benadryl  2am- I woke up unable to move my arms, hands, legs, and feet. I wasn?t able to wake my husband and remained as calm as possible. I drifted in and out of sleep. By 4am I was able to wake my husband. He used our elevating bed to sit me up and gave me ibuprofen and water through a straw (not sure why that was his solution and just thankful I?m here today to type this response). By 6am I had terrible shooting pains in my hands, fingers and then Charlie horses in my feet and calves. That is when the ability to move came back. At that point I was extremely fatigued and exhausted and felt like I had a terrible flu. I was in bed for the next 6 hours clammy and  sweaty and in a very achy.  24 hours after the vaccine I was back on my feet.  50 some hours after the vaccine I still have an aching in my hip on my left side and tenderness at the injection site.

It&#39;s been over a month and the injection site is numb to the touch, while the surrounding area burns, tingles and is soar to the touch. If I move my arm a certain way, I will get a tingling shock in the area (feels like hitting funny bone). Muscles up and down arm burn after non-strenuous activity.

                                                Around four hours later began with a head, heart beat really fast, small fever, extreme nausea and IBS-like symptoms (gas pains and diarrhea), fatigue. The later lasted for nearly a week, but the rest were gone by day 3. I did not see a dr as my fever never got very high and only occurred the first night. The nausea last maybe a day and a half. I am about two weeks out and I seem to be having a gluten skin reaction (dermatitis herpetiformis) and given most of the symptoms I listed could also be celiac symptoms, I was curious if there was gluten in the shot as it was very much like an extreme reaction to gluten that I normally get with celiac. I usually see gluten rashes a couple of weeks to a month after being exposed and I was not exposed to anything during the last few weeks that could be causing it (that I know of). The nurse who gave me the shot did not know if there was gluten in the shot. Hence, I know the first symptoms were definitely related to the shot, but not if the current rash is from the shot (because gluten, this is definitely DH and not an allergy rash). I hope this helps, if other celiacs have also had a hard time.

                                                Received dose at 12:30 pm on Saturday. By 6:30 pm I had severe fever, chills, severe headache, and generalized aches until about 4 am. Woke up around 7 am feeling better. Mild heat flashes until about noon. Felt fine the rest of the day. On Thursday 3/25 around 6pm I started developing hives, itching and red rashes on bilateral lower legs. Thighs, knees, feet and ankles. I waited several hours to see if it would go away and it did not. By 10:30 pm it was much worse. I took a 25mg Benadryl tab. Rash went away. On Friday 3/26 rash and hives, itching and red rashes returned. Both kneecaps very red and hot. It mainly stayed on lower legs until about 5 pm. The rash then started on bilateral arms. I took another Benadryl at 6pm. It is currently 7pm.

                                                I have a history of Guillain barre and typically after infections or vaccines I get a relapse of symptoms. About 2.5 hours after my injection I noticed numbness starting at the tip of my toes on my left foot. By 5 hours after same on my right. At 24 hours it was up to the base of the toes. Now 2 days after I have numbness to the balls of my feet. I also have numbness around the injection site. Although this is fairly normal for me. Typically lasts about 3-7 days of progression with 1-2 weeks to resolve. So far the pace is spot on for my history. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Fingertips still feel like electricity is running through them and fingers/hands still hurt; extremely hungry/thirsty from 03/25/2021 - 03/29/2021; fatigue, pain at base of skull under ears, tinnitus extremely loud and both ears feel like ear ache; During the night of my high fever, lower back where kidneys are started hurting very badly.  What is still left of that pain on day 5 is a pain radiating from my lower back down my right leg many times throughout the day (treating with ibuphrophen).   Pain around knees, elbows, ankles, and bottom of feet- different than joint pain.  All my POTS symptoms are in high gear (tachycardias, very low BP,  pain, dizzy, vertigo).    If the leg/lower back pain, and left arm problems continue, I will see my neurologist or immunologist.  I have reached out to both to make them aware.  My husband had the JJ shot same day, same place and had zero side affects.

                                                I was directed to my seat (if walking into the room, the first table but the 2nd seat).  The woman was learning the computer system from a gentleman, and she assured me she just didn&#39;t know the computer, but knew how to give a shot.  I pulled my arm out of my sweatshirt and pushed my short sleeve shirt up.  She did the alcohol wipe, then pinched my arm, I looked away as the shot went in.  I felt a horrible pain...not even sure how to describe it, just extreme pain and very achy and said Ow maybe 3 times (I am one that can tolerate quite a bit of pain, and I assumed it would sting, but this was different) as she was injecting me.  She apologized. The gentleman said Johnson and Johnson is a little thicker.  I said to him that I had never ever experienced this much pain with a vaccine before-never.  Again, I am talking about as it was injected. I went to sit down for the waiting area, the gentleman who was handing out cards for reviews asked me about it and I said it hurt so bad, I&#39;d never had a shot hurt that bad.  Another worker (female) overheard me and asked me if it was a burning-she had a burning with hers (think she said moderna). I said I would not necessarily say it was a burning, it was pain. As I sat there, I texted my husband and told him how bad it hurt (with the injection) and I&#39;ve never had a vaccine hurt like that.  I started to wonder if it was administered incorrectly? I looked over and the gentleman was now doing the vaccines and she was watching. My husband had Pfizer and he said that didn&#39;t hurt at all. I was feeling it up into my neck as I was sitting there. I was trying to rub my arm and neck hoping that would help as well as move my arm around. When we could leave, I asked the volunteer if she had heard of anyone else having that much pain DURING the shot.  She said she only heard of maybe one other person that said ow. I left, started to cry in the car because of the pain and experience, then spoke with my husband before I left. I came home and got some ice to put on my arm hoping that would help. I did expect pain in the arm after a shot. Within a couple of hours, I noticed pain going down my arm and into my wrist. I thought maybe I needed to be active with my arm and move it so tried that.  I started to notice more side effects of the vaccine as the evening progressed:  I had the typical side effects I figured I&#39;d have, achy, joint pain, chills, nauseous, no fever though. I was noticing pain into my neck (occasionally even into jaw), shoulder, scapula area of the back, and left side under the bottom part of my ribs.  I was feeling tightness in my chest, too, so I decided to try 2 aspirin to see if it helped with any symptoms. I did have slight dizziness, and a weird sensation in my head-like a zapping? I didn&#39;t sleep well, and had to stay completely off of my left side. Thursday, I felt better than that night, but still tired, achy, nauseous, chills, and not 100%.  My arm still was really affected...it seemed extremely fatigued as well as painful...the pain was radiating up and down and couldn&#39;t raise my arm without it hurting. Around noon I decided to take 2 aleve to see if that would help me at all. It did help with the pain and achiness, but was getting a &#34;nerve-type&#34; pain still up and down my left arm into neck/scapula area down to my wrist and hand/fingers. Still couldn&#39;t sleep on my left side. Friday, I was definitely doing better with all the other symptoms, I could abduct my arm more than 90 degrees, so I was excited about that. I did wake up with my middle/ring finger hurting (at the base of that area) and a bit numb so put my hand in and out of a fist. The pain subsided, but the numbness/tingling sensation was still there. I continued to take aleve hoping that maybe there was just inflammation around the nerve causing the issue.  Aleve did help, but it still never went away completely.  By late afternoon, I was getting concerned if I was permanently affected by this. As I was holding a bowl of food and eating, my left arm was going numb. I was even feeling it into my gluts (sciatica?). Again...all of this was after the shot and only on the side I received the shot. That evening I was able to lay on my left side, but not for long periods of time because it became uncomfortable and arm would go numb. Saturday, I still had the nerve pain and was not in a good spot.  It made me sad, angry, scared, and I didn&#39;t want to talk about it too much-just wanted my arm and all the different radiating pains I was having to be back to normal. I was feeling it up into my neck, scapula, my side(the rib area I previously mentioned), even into my gluts and down leg near ankle as well as down the arm into elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand, fingers (particularly that middle finger and thumb area).  I tried to use my arm as normally as possible thinking maybe I need to just keep it moving, but it would fatigue, especially between shoulder and neck. I tried Ibuprofen on this day.  Again, the pain relievers helped some, but didn&#39;t take it all away. Sunday I was in a horrible spot mentally and crying throughout the day because of the sensations I was feeling still: up and down the arm, shoulder, neck, scapula, side and still into ankle area. I decided I would call my doctor on Monday. Monday, I woke up and was feeling better overall, but still having the nerve sensations down my arm as well as up into shoulder, neck, scapula and my left side.  But everything was not as intense.  I spoke to my doctor who said there was a protocol, a number I needed to call.  Monday night I took ibuprofen because I started to have a horrible headache-didn&#39;t go away completely and still have this morning-not sure if it&#39;s related or just a normal headache. Still feeling tingling nerve sensations into forearm and fingers.  My shoulder/neck area feels fatigued, but so far not noticing the nerve pain yet, so that&#39;s a positive. On Monday,  it seemed to get worse as the day went on, so we will see. I definitely feel in hand/wrist/fingers as I am typing now. I know this is a lot, and I think I&#39;ve captured it.  Again, I had none of this pre-shot.  The pain during injection is what alarmed me most as I expected side effects after the shot, but not this nerve type issue.  For this to be lasting as long as it is concerns me, and the fact that it exhibits on my left side where I got the shot. I am very anxious as it hasn&#39;t gotten back to normal.

Also low grade fever with sweats and mild sore throat.  Arm was mildly sore at injection site for several days.  Headache and fatigue continued for three full days. On 5th and 6th day after vaccine, had diarrhea.  Was told by doctor at vaccine event not to take any anti-inflammatories for 3 to 5 days.  He said Tylenol was ok.  Took Tylenol day after vaccine when adverse effects were the worst and it did not help at all.  Finally took Advil on day 4 and it relieved headache.  Now 7 days after vaccine still have intermittent headache.

The flu-like symptoms included muscle aches, nausea, stomach pain including more significant pain in the upper left stomach area, headache and fatigue with difficulty sleeping.  I needed to take time off from work due to these side effects and had difficulty performing daily activities.  Also experienced pain at injection site that got worse in the first 12 hours and lasted also approximately 36 hours.  Minor nausea, stomach pain and injection site pain have continued after 36 hours with ability to return to daily living activities.

NO FEVER but major body aches and soreness. AFter the chills wore off I was in a sweat..this pattern of chills, vs soaking sweats continued throughout the night. Add to that dry heaves due to nausea but no vomiting. The dry heaves just added to the muscle pains that I already had. I was in bed until 5 pm the next day, no energy, sore body aches to the point that my skin hurt. still no soreness in my arm at all. I finally had the strength to get out of bed at 5pm took a shower and ate 2 pieces of toast to combat the nausea. Fast forward next day, felt fine and arm was mildly sore at injection sight. SO glad J and J is only one dose.. I would have dreaded a second day like that.

Dizziness lasted for a few minutes which created nausea. Sat at site for approximately 25 minutes after shot. Left arm was sore between shoulder and elbow, which was to be expected. Later in the evening, experienced fatigue. When trying to go to bed around 11pm,  my left are was throbbing. I did take Tylenol at about 6pm. Throughout the AM hours, sever body aches started, extreme fatigue throughout the following day. Flu like symptoms continued the next day.  I had heard of these symptoms for the other shots but not for Johnson and Johnson. Hungry but too weak to actually cook.

RN asks patient to elaborate on reasons why she is needing to ambulate and encourages patient to sit for assessment.  She states, &#34;No, I really don&#39;t want to sit, I feel like I need to walk.  I have a tingling down the back of my neck, it really feels warm actually hot, I think if you take my vitals it will only make it worse&#34;.  RN again requests that patient sit and allow for vital signs to be taken, patient refuses, and asks for water.  RN provides a bottle of water for patient and she says that she would like to stay in recovery a little longer.  Patient ambulates in area for (with RN observation) and verbalizes that she is feeling a little better with walking.  Again, upon visual examination no changes noted in patient skin on neck or sholders.   At 1248 patient agrees to sit, but again refuses additional assessment.   By 1247, patient states that she is feeling better, denies dizziness and states that heat in neck has decreased.  Patient reports having similar reaction after taking Compazine. By 1250, patient verbally expresses that she is ready to depart clinic.  Advised to seek medical attention after departure if necessary, with increase or significant change in symptoms. Patient verbalizes understanding.  Ambulates from clinic alone at 1251.

It felt like my bones were made out of glass and someone had taken a hammer to my bones.  My face was swollen and red.  Unable to sit up.  Walk from bed to toilet only.  Overall, I would say extreme flu-like symptoms.  Temperature 99.6 all day.   I could not take the pain any further at 4:20 pm and took 1,000 mg of Tylenol.  I finally fell asleep and woke up at 8:30pm and could walk again and my fever had broken.  I still don&#39;t feel great, but I think the worst is behind me.

                                                On the evening of March 16, 2021, I developed an itchy rash (and possible hives) from my elbows down to the tips of my fingers on both arms and from my knees down to my feet on both legs. On March 15, I had taken a long walk outside, so the rash seems to have followed exposure to sunlight, which is the same allergic reaction I have had to sulfa drugs in the past. So this made me think that potentially my itchy rash/hives could be an allergic reaction to the vaccine, but I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;m just reporting it out of an abundance of caution. I am taking Benadryl and using an anti-itch lotion and cold compresses. The rash/hives are still present more than 24 hours later, but even though the itchiness is bothersome, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a severe problem. I am hoping it will go away soon. I plan to let my primary care person know via email, but I don&#39;t currently plan to see her about this unless it doesn&#39;t go away after a few days  or gets worse.

The staff noticed I was in some distress and kept asking if I was okay to which I replied I thought I&#39;d be fine once I got some fresh air.  Left the facility to drive home and didn&#39;t feel right, Within 30 minutes, developed chest pains, rash and labored breathing.  I recognize the symptoms as the same symptoms I get when I&#39;ve had morphine, which I now must list as an allergy.  This lasted 4 hours, then got better.  The next day around 1:00, I became ill again with flu-like symptoms and had to leave work.  Headache and body aches mostly.  I was ill with these symptoms for a 24 hour period.  Hopefully all symptoms have passed, except my arm which is red, swollen, itchy and feverish.

                                                Moments after the vaccine my arm and hands started tingling and becoming numb in various spots which continued all over my entire face.  I was monitored and was given a shot of benedryl and was sent home after a while.   The next day I felt really groggy, latargic and had diarreah.  That monday the numbness went up to my ear and I reached out to my PCP who prescribed a steroid.   Later that evening I got a really bad headache and the tingling and numbness hit my feet then went up my legs, my arms and up and down my body.  Its a feeling as if my body has fallen asleep.

Over the next 10 minutes, I noticed swelling in my throat (swallowing felt somewhat obstructed).  These persisted for an hour or so until I took Benedryl which seemed to ease the numbness but the swollen throat persisted..

Pharmacist had instructed me to wait 15 minutes after injection in case of a reaction, which I did. I felt fine when I left the store and got into my car, but while driving home, I began to have the symptoms described above. I pulled into a hospital ER parking lot and stayed in or near my car until the symptoms subsided. I called my GP and talked to a nurse, who said if I could breathe and swallow, I was safe to go home. I did not enter the hospital ER or seek medical treatment because the symptoms did not get worse. After returning home and waiting about another hour, facial numbness completely subsided.

Shakin lasted for over 2hrs at which point I took 2 Tylenols. After 20min the shaking decreased. The shaking came back about 1.5hrs later. At that point I took 2 ibuprofens. The shaking went away. The entire following day had mild fever. have been tired physically for a week now after receiving the vaccine. Lost sense of smell and taste on the 3rd day after vaccination. It has since slowly improved. Botox injection sites (received Botox injection for migraine on March 4, 2 days before the J&amp;J vaccine) are still slightly red a week after the vaccine. My facial skin is breaking out also. Vaginal yeast infection started 4 days after receiving the vaccination. I feel slower than usual in my thinking processes since the vaccination.

By the second or third day post-vaccine I developed hives on the back of my neck and shoulders and cold sores on my mouth and nose and continued to have a headache.  I was seen by my doctor on March 12th and was told that I had a sinus infection.  I was prescribed 100 mg Doxycycline Hyclate and began seeing improvements within 36 hours to the sinus infection.  The hives are still clearing up and were not treated.

                                                Left arm was sore after injection, but on day 8 after receiving the vaccine my arm throbs all the time.  I have had pain in my left arm from the shoulder to the elbow for the past 5 days and it seems to get worse.  Ibuprofen and Tylenol did not seem to help much.  It is difficult to use the arm because of the pain .  I can?t sleep right now so I figured I would fill this out.

                                                The next day after the shot, I had a small rash on my wrist.  It disappeared during the day.  Saturday evening, my right thigh felt like it received a trauma like a hit, but I did not have an injury.  An area the size of my hand is slightly pink on the thigh.  On Tuesday, I tried starting ibuprofen, but it did not really remedy the pain.  I went to urgent care Wed. evening.  They sent me for an ultrasound to rule out blood clots.  No blood clots, but lymph nodes were visible in ultrasound.  They suggested I follow-up with PCP.  On Thursday and Friday, the leg felt crampy but less painful.  Friday night the pain traveled down my right leg to ankle as well as right lower lung had dull ache.  Returned to urgent care.  They are treating the leg for cellulitis (1000mg daily of generic Keflex.)  They said if the leg felt better in 24 hrs, probably cellulitis, but if not, it might be a response to vaccine.  There is no relief after 3 doses and 24 hr &#43; later.

                                                I got sick to my stomach an hour after getting the shot and it lasted all night. I didn?t have much appetited. I had vomiting and diarrhea for seven hours. I had hives about an hour and a half after the shot all over especially and my feet. The hives were extremely itchy, and my skin felt like it was on fire. The next morning, I went to urgent care and gave me an anti-itch medicine/antihistamine Hydroxyzine. The prescribed medicine knocked me out, but it only helped a little with the itching. The hives stayed for another four days. I have also had severe joint pain that is still lingering in my feet and hands. I don?t normally have joint pain, but it started the day after the shot.

No other symptoms that day. Today is Tuesday,  March 23 and I am still experiencing side effects from the vaccine. The side effects, other than the &#34;brain ache&#34; come and go. The side effects include what I can describe as a &#34;brain&#34; ache, some itching (3/16), random sweating, arms feeling like dead weight, overall general feeling sick, random body aches (don&#39;t last long), dragging of feet when walking, noises being louder than what they actually are, brain &#34;fog&#34;, dizziness, nausea, tingling in legs and feet .  What I describe as a &#34;brain ache is a different feeling than a headache or migraine.  It is as if my brain actually hurts. A very notable side effect that occurred on  Wednesday, March 17, was an episode of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. Throughout my life I have experienced AIWS  at bedtime.  On Wednesday, I experienced an episode during the day and it lasted for three hours.  My session is going to log me out.  I cannot type anymore.  Please contact me for more inforamtion.

Basically every muscle hurt and I really couldn&#39;t move.  I spent the entire day in bed unable to eat or even move. I had to take the day off from work.   I think I had Covid in Feb 2020 before testing began. The symptoms I felt in February 2020 were exactly the same beginning 12 hours after the vaccine.

                                                I was held for approx 30 minutes. Drove out and when driving home started to get short of breath, so turned towards the hospital rather than home and called them. My significant other also had his shot, so we switched spots driving at that time. I called the hospital on my way when I started to feel my throat start to close at exactly 1829 on my phone (6:29 pm.). Appointment was at 6pm for shot. Hospital was 13 minutes away. Half way there my tongue started to swell and my lips slightly with tingle. My breathing was more labored to keep up effort as I could not expand my lungs to capacity. I was always able to breath and speak, my voice did become more raspy.    Upon ER, Blood Pressure was very Hypertensive around 140s/120s with my respiratory effort to get in. Pulse was stable around 70-80. O2 was 97-99.  I was able to lay down and relax my breathing which relaxed my blood pressure to 140s/ 80s. I was given IV Benadryl, IV Dexadron, PO Pepcid with a liter of fluid. Monitor up until after 8pm when I was released with still mild tonge swelling but breathing ok. Continue Benadryl at home with my Epi pen for bees stings available.    Did go to work today 07/08/2021. Was wheezy, SOB, no throat swelling, tongue swelling at base. Kept up with Benadryl. Made it 1/2 day and went home. Walking and movement makes increase lung workload. My staff concerned with effort and flush skin while getting supplies. But flush and redness does subside some with rest. When talking need to take a break to breath. But can today notice when Benadryl kicks in. No history of Asthma ever or breathing issues ever. Very active on my farm and at work.

                                                Bell&#39;s palsy symptoms within an hour after receiving vaccine injection:  consisted of right-sided facial numbness, right-sided eyelid droop, right-sided mouth turn, right-sided tightness in neck muscle, pressure behind right eye, headache, loss of balance, difficulty speaking.  The injection was at 3:15 pm and started with arm soreness and stinging, a slight headache, and some tingling in my right hand while waiting 15 minutes after the shot, I had also felt a sensation going up the right side of the back of my neck almost immediately after the injection.  The Bell&#39;s palsy symptoms started by 4:00 pm.  I had a low-grade temp that evening of 99.9.  I emailed my neurologist who I see for migraines, of my symptoms.  The following morning on 03-10-2021 I woke with a severe migraine, fullness in my right ear, more pressure behind my right eye and it is watery, with new ringing in both ears, louder in the right ear.   Still residual numbness and drooping of right side of face and eye, tightness in right side neck muscle in front, and speaking better.   Woke up on Thursday morning 03-11-2021 with flu symptoms and migraine gone.  Eye pressure still there and now having significant pain moving my eye and now more feeling of fullness in my right ear.  Eye pain was concerning.  Dr advised me at this time if symptoms have continued or gotten worse to go to the emergency room.   Today, Saturday 03-13-2021, I am still experiencing moderate eye pain behind/above my right eye with pressure.  I am continuing to treat the pain with oxycodone prescribed by ER Physician.

Patient stated she has some full budding numbing experience but no anaphylaxis. We gave her the J&amp;J covid 19 vaccine and asked her to wait 30 minutes to be monitored due to her past allergies. Around 20 minutes patient let one of the pharmacist know she was feeling very flushed and dizzy. We brought her over to the side to be monitored more closely. We had patient elevate her feet to help with faint feeling and drink some water.  Within 5 to 10 minutes her symptoms  started worsening. Tingling sensation started going up her side of head and neck. It started moving to the front of her face. Once that happened I asked how her breathing was and she was starting to get short of breath. Soon after patients throat started to close. We administer 0.3 m of epinephrine and called 911. Pt was able to breathe a little better but within 5 minutes she was back to gasping for air, we administered another 0.3 mg of epinephrine and the paramedics arrived.

Still cannot go out of house or drive.

Day 7-present Knot harder and maybe bigger. And the tingle in the arm and fingers  is back. I&#39;ve done some  research and this is not mentioned anywhere. Especially at 12 days. Nor anyone i know with this symptom. I thought it was worth mentioning. Will call doctor if arm tingle doesn&#39;t go away by early next week.

                                                I believe the shot was improperly administered too close to my shoulder joint, and as a result, I have experienced increasing pain over the last 11 days.  Initially, there was mild pain (I would rate a 3-4 out of 10) near the injection site immediately which persisted for days as expected after getting a shot; mainly discomfort during sleep and when moving my arm. Pain has become progressively worse, and not better as reported to be a normal and expected side effect. At day 10 I called my PCP to go in for an exam. She ordered an Xray and prescribed muscle relaxers. Xray showed no signs of breakage (as expected).  Today is day 11 and  I can barely move or lift my arm without severe discomfort, I would rate the pain as severe (9 out of 10) when moving or lifting my arm, rotating shoulder, sleeping on it.  While I have not been diagnosed with anything in particular yet, I believe I have a shoulder injury relating to improper vaccine administration (SIRVA). I have requested to be referred to a shoulder specialist for evaluation. I have not had prior injuries or symptoms in this area. I am an active and healthy person with no known health conditions and this is very troubling. I am a strong advocate for COVID vaccines, yet, I must say this experience has me questioning my decision to get one.  I never knew this could happen, and I sincerely hope my shoulder is not permanently impacted by this event.

                                                Woke up with discomfort/pain in my breastbone area.  It spread to my esophageal tube (extremely tender), a couple hours later my throat became strep-like sore, could not take a full breath, and throat swelling impacted my ability to talk clearly.  About 12 hours later, I had facial swelling.  One full day later, a chain-like rash appeared on my arms, chest, thighs, and feet.  Each subsequent day is spread to a new body part (but never occurred on my face),  I had to take Benadryl EVERY 4-5 hours to keep everything at bay.  Three days into the event my neck and torso skin were extremely painful to touch.  Most days since, I am exhausted and get winded easily.  Today is 30MAR21 and it&#39;s happening again as it began on 21MAR21.  I took two Benadryl in the hopes I will not have to go to ER again.

                                                I am having neck pain and left arm pain.  I would say that the arm pain may be muscular.  I have been taking  ibuprofen and tylenol fo the past few days.  I went to the Chiropractor and had temporary relief of the neck pain.  It lasted for maybe 10 minutes it is hard to turn my head to the left.  I am just letting you know about the reaction.    The other thing is that the injection area the first day was very itchy I know better than to scratch it.  It becomes very itchy on and off yesterday and today.  These are probably not what you want for adverse side effects but I am letting you know that this is the case with me.

She stated that she had body aches and chills the day after the vaccine. The aches went away but the patient reports that the chills in her hands, legs, and feet have persisted. The patient also said that she started to have facial paralysis on 4/3/21. Also on 4/3/21 she reported developing multiple skin rashes on different areas of the body. She also said she went to the ER and had multiple tests run, including an MRI to rule out stroke. She did report to her primary care doctor who advised her to see a Neurologist. I offered to reach out to her primary care but she did not provide the information. I advised the patient that she would need to seek care from a provider who could assess and treat her as needed. I called Janssen and they said the facial paralysis is a very rare possibility but did not have any additional information to provide me. They advised me to tell the patient to seek medical care as necessary. I spoke with the patient multiple times this evening and provided her with the information to VAERS and Vsafe. I also let her know that I contacted Janssen and gave her the information they gave me. I expressed to her that I understood that she was concerned and she could reach out to me if needed. I also will follow up with her later in the week.

                                                Within 30-60 seconds of receiving the vaccine my heart started racing. No other symptoms. I alerted the nurse - she took my blood pressure and it was very high (XXX/110). EMTs were called in case I was having an allergic reaction, but I did not have any other symptoms of allergies, just a very high BP and heart rate. At this point I&#39;m sure anxiety drove my BP higher, on top of the reaction, since I was concerned I was going to go into anaphylaxis, but the original racing heart started within one minute of the injection while I was beginning my 15 minute wait time near the injection station. I worked on regulating my breathing and with the EMTs monitoring, my BP down to a manageable but still elevated rate after about 20 minutes. I did not go to the hospital. Once I was resting at home it took about 4 hours before I felt my heart rate was at a normal level and the feeling of racing was gone.  I did not have any other adverse reactions until 4/7/2021 which is the first day that the injection site (upper L arm) started aching.

                                                Started out with immense headache which proceeded to chills and full body aches. Body aches were the worst part of it - they were so bad I could not get up or walk. They started middle of the night I received the vaccine, lasted all the next day and into the next morning. By that evening I felt much better with just a headache and by the following day all symptoms subsided    I had hardly any Odin at the injection site unless I pushed or laid on it and no swelling or rash at all.

                                                I got the normal muscle aches, pain, fatigue, fever (103),and headache. I had on Sunday, the day after I had pain under my left rib toward my side, leg and groin. I had developed red spots on my legs. I contacted my PCP and they sent my platelet test and it can back ok. I went in to see my PCP and he checked me and only thing he came up with  due to my auto immune disease it triggered inflammation.  I&#39;m still in pain everywhere and can&#39;t touch certain parts of my body, my Dr. can&#39;t figure out where it&#39;s from and believes it&#39;s from the shot. If it&#39;s not better in a week he wants me to go back.

                                                Within minutes of getting the shot, my throat became itchy and the roof of my mouth felt like it was burning.  I started breaking out in hives , coughing and trying to clear my throat.  I was taken to the medical area and given a dose of liquid Benadryl.  Within 20 minutes it was easier to breathe and my blood pressure and pulse ox returned to normal.  About 3 hours later I started to get itchy again around my throat and ears.  Per the guidance of the nurse at the vaccine site, I took 2 - 25mg Benadryl tablets.  By the next morning I felt better.

It all was heavy and number and tingling.  That continued most of the day.  The next day I was extremely fatigued and weak and stayed in bed.  I think had left ear and lymph node pain on the left side of my face and neck.  This continued for days.  By the 1 week mark after my injection, I ended up at the urgent care with facial swelling and extreme lymph node pain.  They stated it was an adverse reaction to the vaccine.  As of yesterday, I continue to have some swelling in my jaw and occipital region as noted by the PTA where I go for physical therapy.  I continue to experience extreme fatigue, worse than normal and dizziness.  My left pinky still has some tingling and vibration feeling.  I also still get cramping on this finger and on the ulnar side of my palm.

Also, it included pain in the arm pit.  I didn&#39;t go to a doctor.  The pain was reduced after taking two 500 mg Tylenol, but there I still feel my left arm heavy and not normal.

Emergency Department Attending Attestation Note   See resident/PA/student note for further details of HPI, history, exam, ED course, and diagnoses.   Briefly, this is a 51 y.o. female with PMH reviewed in chart and w/ patient notable for insulin dependent diabetes, depression, prothrombin mutation, migraine, p/w concern for allergic reaction.  Emesis or change in Covid vaccine today.  10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, patient reports feeling thick in her tongue with tingling in her lips.  Patient was given Zertec.  The minutes later, her lips began to swell up and was also noted to have new erythematous rash between her eyes and forehead.  Patient was given 50 mg of Benadryl.  Patient felt like she could not swallow with worsening lip swelling.  She was given EpiPen and 911 was called. No stridors.  No wheezing.  Reports continued tingling and the numbness in her mouth but no lip swelling or tongue swelling.  Denies any difficulty swallowing at this time.  No wheezing.  No abdominal pain or nausea.  No rash at this time.   Of note, patient also notes left-sided facial, arm, and leg numbness starting about 10 minutes prior to arrival to the emergency department.  She reports that she has had recurrent numbness on the left side in the past, which was thought to be due to migraine versus TIA.  She has had extensive work-up and multiple hospitalization for this symptom.  She reports that she is allergic to iodine and gadolinium containing contrast.  Denies any headache at this time though she had a mild headache after receiving the vaccine.  Denies any blurry vision.  Denies any weakness in her bilateral upper and lower extremities.  Assessment and Plan:    Vital signs notable for O2 sat of 96 to 98% on room air without tachypnea.  Patient is mildly hypertensive.  Patient is well-appearing speaking full sentences without any dysarthria.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Extraocular movement intact.  She notes diminished sensation to her left face, left upper extremity, and left lower extremity.  Tongue is midline.  Hearing is intact bilaterally.  No facial droop.  She has 5 out of 5 strength in bilateral upper and lower extremities.  No pronator drift.  Normal gait.  No tongue swelling or lip swelling.  No stridors.  No uvula swelling.  No pharyngeal or erythema.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezing or rhonchi.  Cardiac exam without murmurs rubs or gallops.  Regular rhythm.  No abdominal distention or tenderness on palpation.  No CVA tenderness.   51-year-old female who is presenting to the emergency department with improving lip swelling and numbness in her mouth, raising a concern for anaphylaxis related to her Covid vaccine.  Reassuringly, status post EpiPen, her symptoms are improving.  However, she has new onset left-sided numbness, with without any headache.  She reports that she has had this numbness in the past the last time she had the numbness on the left side was approximately 10 years ago.  Her neurologic exam is only notable for diffuse numbness on her left side including her face.  Differential diagnosis include migraine headache and TIA.  Stroke is possible though less likely given the patient has had the same symptoms in the past with negative work-up.  Will defer code stroke at this time but will emergently consult neurology.  Will get labs including BMP and CBC.  We will continue to monitor her from the anaphylaxis perspective.  We will also give her a dose of steroid.  Prednisone 60 mg by mouth given 12:29 PM  NEUROLOGY CONSULT NOTE  Assessment: Formulation- Diagnosis is guarded. Localization structurally would suggest subcortical (thalamic) or small brain-stem in a sensory territory on the right. Etiologies could be stroke given her vascular risk factors but seems unlikely given there is stereotypy of earlier symptomatology. Demyelinating would be another possibility as well, but again, the stereotype. Seizure unlikely because of the timing of rush from toes to body was minutes and duration of some occasions being days. Complicated migraine possible, has some risk factors, but should be treated as dx of exclusion. She does make complaint of headache, which could support. Some FND elaboration on her anxiety-ridden allergic reaction is also possible, but no objective non-structural signs to support.

Day 2 just some fatigue. On day 3 started experiencing rash/hives and extreme itching all over body, especially throughout the night on 4th night. Took antihistamine which helped alleviate for time being. I?m currently on day 5 and there are still some hives present. I will continue antihistamine if needed.

                                                Approximately 7 hours after vaccination, my neck began to ache. Shortly thereafter, I began feeling cold and having chills. This progressed to rigors and fevers (highest temperature measured 102.9 F), which continued through the night. The following day I felt weak. Within 48 hours, the worst of it was over, although I did have mild pain at the injection site for 2-3 days.

                                                The day of the vaccine not much trouble, the injection site was a little sore. As the evening came I started feeling the body aches, the chills. The next morning  I had a headache, I had joint pains (elbow, knee and hip). My arm pain was really severe. I could not even sleep on that side of my arm, the pain was excruciating.  I also noticed as I woke up that I also had hives, and it was red and hot and itching, blisters, all over my hand. I then contacted my PCP and they suggested Benadryl capsules. It took about a week for the rash to go away, I finally can wear my ring back (hands were very swollen). Now, I noticed I developed a cough about after a week after the vaccine. The rash is gone off my hands but the skin looks like it is peeling (reminds me of when a person has a real bad sunburn on skin and the burnt skin starts peeling off) from all the blistering and the rash on my hands. I did have COVID in late November, early December. I tested positive on 11/30/2020. The new skin that is being exposed is really tender and sore. I notice with each passing day skin feels better not so sensitive.  I get a little bit better each day, a little more energy each day.

A few hours later, I had a 101 fever, chills, stronger fatigue, strong headache, muscle aches. Around 6pm, I began vomiting continuously. I spoke with an advice nurse and she told me to go to the emergency room. I continued to vomit until about 11:30pm, I was weak and felt like passing out a few times. Later in the evening, I took a Tylenol and finally went to sleep. On April 2nd (day after shot), I woke up with fatigue and headache, but fever was gone and I no longer vomited. I took another Tylenol and headache went away.

                                                Received my injection on Wednesday and had a deep tissue massage on Friday. My back broke out in welts but stayed on my back and shoulder area. Clinician did not use anything different when working on me. Itchy rash has remained now for 4 days and is about 50% resolved.

                                                Pain at the injection site shortly after the injection. Pain and tenderness in bicep began generally later the first day and lasted 2 weeks; I still have some bicep stiffness and tenderness today on Day 18. I had tenderness under the right armpit for about a week (assumed swollen lymph nodes).I had redness on the bicep below the injection site on Days 5-7. I also was tired on Day 2, 3, and 16 and took short naps. I experienced some muscle twitching in the bicep on Day 1, which still continues. On Day 6, I woke up with muscle twitching all over my body, randomly and intermittently. I was able to go about my day normally, but every few minutes something would twitch for a few seconds (my right arm, my left arm, my left knee, my right hip, my lower back, my left pointer finger, my left eyebrow, my diaphragm, etc). I drank a lot of fluids and took magnesium, zinc, D, B, C, omegas, turmeric, a multivitamin, and ate a banana for potassium on Day 6 and 7. Day 7 and 8, I only had muscle twitching in the right bicep again. Starting on Day 9 and continuing through the present, I continue to have intermittent twitches lasting a few seconds all over my body again. It is less frequent than on Day 6, but continues.

The next day the sore throat was gone, and body aches got worse. All my joints ache. I felt chilled in spite of outdoor temperature of 79, and a hot bath, blankets and sitting in front of a fire. It was 74 inside the house. I started to get a bit of a headache but it never developed into a full headache. At about 6pm (day 2) I started to get  hot. Anything touching my skin bothered me.   At about 7pm (day 2) I took two Tylenol and the symptoms improved by about  8:30pm.

Next morning fever, fatigue, deep muscle pain across back of shoulders concentrated at base of neck, headache, ringing in ears.  Later that night, severe sudden muscle spasms on left side of lower back....spun me around and doubled me over...left me feeling a little breathless.  Next morning (day 3), still some deep muscle pain now dispersed across back,. Less burning at injection site, fever but less, coughing up some clear glen from lungs....breathing ok though, still fatigued.

                                                On Friday 03-12-2021, went to wash my face and my whole face was red, flushed and very itchy. I then went to sleep and on Saturday morning when I woke up my right wrist was itching a lot as well as  my legs, buttocks and hands. All over my body was red and very itchy. I did not sleep due to the itchiness on Saturday night. I developed little red bumps on my entire body. I ate lentils for food but I do not think it was the food. I went to urgent care and saw a doctor who gave me Benadryl, took one dose and then it slowly started to go away.

I woke at 5:30 the next morning with a fever of 99.9 F, a headache, chills and body aches.  These symptoms continued throughout the day and were alleviated somewhat by tylenol.  I slept a large part of the day and felt better when I woke the next day, Monday.  On Monday I felt mostly normal but still had some body aches including a back ache on my left side.  I also had more injection site pain and a red rash about a half dollar in size that was tender to touch and by night time was itchy.

                                                Vaccination was 10:30 am.  Around 6:30 pm, my right knee started to throb.  I took an epsom salt bath, where my upper back started to hurt.  I went to sleep around 8:00.  I woke up around 10 pm unable to open my eyes all the way.  I believe they were swollen nearly shut.  I could see a slit of light coming in from outside.  I couldn&#39;t move my left hand at all (left arm is where I received vaccination).  I held it up to the outside light, and it was swollen.  The light coming in from outside hurt my eyes.  I couldn&#39;t see enough to call for help.  Around 1:30 a.m., the swelling went down enough for me to open my eyes.  I have never seen them look so bloodshot.  It was scary.  I could move my hand again as well.  I spent next day in bed resting.   Monday, I noticed a small rash on my right shoulder.  I went to work and was there about 20 minutes before I started feeling hot and dizzy.  I went home and spent the day in bed.   I was able to go to work the next day, Tuesday, without problem.  One week after vaccination, the rash on my shoulder went away, but a small rash broke out on my right shin.  This one was deeper.  One week later, there are just a couple of small scabs left in the spot on my shin.  I feel my energy level is close to normal.

                                                Received vaccine at 10am - 20 mins later felt slight prickly itching in both arms between armpit and elbow. Lasted about 10 minutes. Around 4pm the same day I had bad neck pain. And pounding heading, about 1 hour later starting getting chills and fatigued. By 10pm had body aches and muscles pains. I took some Motrin and went to bed. I couldn?t sleep as my mind kept racing. In the morning (day after vaccine) I was feeling worse. All symptoms continued in full force and I couldn?t get out of bed. 10am I was able to drink some Alka seltzer cold medicine and lay back down. I continued to have chills pounding headache bodyaches muscle aches and sweating, but no fever. I felt like I had a bad case of the flu. I?ve continued taking 600 mg Motrin every eight hours and this has helped with the pains and bodyaches. Day 3 woke up feeling much better, noticed a funny smell in my nose, I haven?t been blowing my nose or had any mucus, but I can?t explain the smell. I still have body aches and muscles pains.

                                                There is some pain at the injection site.  The day after I got the shot I was very tired.  Later that night I started to get a headache and realized I had a low temp fever.  My daughter had the same symptoms as I did.  She received the shot right before me so the lot number is the same as mine.  This is 3 days later and I am ok except my arm is still a little sore.

Worth noting that I was so excited about getting the vaccination that I could not sleep the night before.  I blame the exhaustion and later headache on lack of sleep, food, and caffeine.  I went to bed early and took acetaminophen and slept well.  In the morning a shower, coffee and breakfast and more acetaminophen makes me almost as good as new.

                                                At about 8 hours post injection, I began to have muscle soreness and slight nausea.  By 11 hours post, I was shivering uncontrollably and had migraine-like headache.  By 13 hours post I had to shed blankets for the fever and sweating. Even taking ibuprofen the fever was high.  The next day I kept taking pain medication for severe body aches. This morning, second morning post injection, I let the pain meds wear off.  I discovered I still had body aches, occasional stabbing head pain, and tingling down my left arm and into my 3rd and 4th fingers.  Currently, third evening post injection, I?m still aching but everything is noticeably improved. I don?t need pain meds anymore.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  Approximately 7 hours after the shot, my body was in a continuous state of needing to stretch. It is like when you wake up in the morning and need to stretch - a whole body stretch- but this was continuous. Over and over and over, right after each other. It went on for many hours. Also, 40 hours after the shot, I noticed a body rash (it could have been there the previous day but I was in bed all day feeling horrible and didn&#39;t notice). I also have a rash on my sacrum area, and I could barely walk with the pain in my bones in that area. As the morning has progressed, I am feeling better in that area but it is still sore. It has been 40 hours after my vaccine and I am still not 100%. Aside from the horrible headache, chills and flu-like symptoms, these are the other side effects I thought need to be reported.

No treatments yet....but if still bad after this weekend, will seek medical help.  Left eye swelling started at 2pm today, with pain. the eye lid and the area around the left eye are painful and swollen. I have been using hot compresses.  Difficulty catching my breath today durning a morning walk. I have been walking for months on the same path and can hold a conversation, but today, I could barely walk and talk. Once I stopped talking I eventually was able to catch my breath, but we had to walk a much slower pace as well.

After 30 minutes of observation there was some faint bruising at the bottom of the swelling.

                                                Had initial onset of arm pain (generalized) and injection site soreness within 12 hours. Over 3-5 days, the acute symptoms gradually cleared. However, a localized, subcutaneous swelling (a &#34;knot&#34;) remains at the time of this report which is day 12. The &#34;knot&#34; is slightly painful when rubbed; has not seemed to decrease in size.  It is questioned if the injection needle placement might be a factor, since the same size needle is used for my tiny, skinny arm (I am Asian, 100 lbs) as is used for my caucasian husband whose arm is 3 times the size as mine.

                                                3/29/2021- received vaccine around 12:15pm  Within 3 hours, I was extremely &#34;hyper&#34;  My husband noticed that my entire left arm (which received the shot) was a different color than my entire right arm.  I did not sleep at all Monday night. 3/30/2021- felt fine until about 1:00pm when I noticed body aches.  It worsened from then until bedtime.  My hands, feet, and back hurt the worst.  I asked my husband to rub my back, and he gasped when I lifted my shirt.  My entire midback area was covered in a bright red, raised rash with blisters. I took Benadryl and applied betamethasone prescription cream (which I use for poison ivy or bug bites).  My hands also itched, so I used the cream on my hands as well. I was sweating profusely but freezing.  Took my temperature several times but it was never over 98.  I could not sleep well, awake for an hour, asleep for 5 minutes off and on all night. 3/31/2021- I notified my primary care physician of the allergic reaction via the patient portal.  His reply was to take Benadryl, which I was already doing every couple hours.  The itchy back rash remained and more blisters formed.  By the time I finished working, the redness was gone but the blisters remained.  Itching stopped.  Body aches were lessening. 4/1/2021- Rash completely gone, itching completely gone.  Feeling lethargic (possibly due to lack of sleep, but maybe from the vaccine).  One large blister (size of a quarter) and several smaller blisters remain. 4/2/2021- as of now, my left arm is still a bit sore when I raise it over my head.  Main concern is the huge blister that is still on my back.

                                                Very painful injection! I felt this going in immediately. Probably 30 minutes after I also felt a little dizzy but I also have a chronic condition called vestibular migraine. I was fatigued later in the evening. Had full day on day after vax  because I already had things on my calendar but was dragging by the time I got home. Aches all over especially joints, head and injection site was warm to touch and somewhat swollen. Also started running fever one day after. Highest temp 101.9 . I also started having diarrhea, full on three days after. My taste and smell had been off since having covid in august, but I swear they are since taking vax. Today is Tuesday so I&#39;m now five days in and temps normal today. My body aches are also improved but my head is still a bit achy.

                                                4/6/21 I awoke with symptoms of numbness/paralysis on left side of face limited to  upper lip and cheek area and both eyes would not stop watering. Movements to drink or make facial expressions were limited due to the numbness.  Because I have sensitive skin  I thought I may have had some type of reaction to something. So I waited to see if it would clear up through the day. I was not experiencing any other symptoms. By that evening it was apparent that I was not getting better and possibly getting worse because I began to experience some noticeable drooping in my cheek area. I decided to call my doctor in the morning. Because I am currently out of town, my home doctor suggested I see a local ER to rule out a stroke and determine if I was experiencing Bell&#39;s Palsy. I went to an ER clinic on 4/7/21

                                                Approx 8 hours after the shot, 12:30am, I started to have chills.  The chills prevented me from sleeping well.  Also when I laid down for the night, I was accutely aware of my heartbeat, which according to my smartwatch was beating at a rate of 71.  The next morning, I still was experiencing chills, and felt achy/stiff/sore muscles - possibly from tensing up and  shivering all night.  Pain at the injection shot also started the morning after the shot.  By bedtime the day after the shot, the symptoms had eased up.  The next morning the symptoms were gone, except for a little residual injection site discomfort.

It was not itchy and mostly resolved within 24 hours. Typically, if I have a virus (common cold), I get a red, lacy rash but only on my arms. I have photos I can share if that would be helpful.

I had to either sit or walk.  I finally have relief from that pain today (Friday).

The day after my temperature was 101 in the morning. The headache and and fatigue lasted three days. I got a rash on day four. My ankles were itchy at first. By lunchtime there was a rash across my back. A flat rash that spread up and down my back. It was different in spots like a round shape rash on my shoulder blade. My forearm and right knee also had a rash. The rash was redder and covered more of my body from my thighs up to my shoulder on the back. It was spreading very itchy for three days. I went to the doctor and started taking Allegra which improved the rash but it is still very itchy after 9 days.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after receiving the Janssen vaccine, the patient complained of numbness and tingling around her mouth and fingertips, felt flush/warmness on her face with noticeable redness, and became hoarse while speaking. The patient was given 25 mg of diphenhydramine at the vaccination event and her hoarseness improved but returned a few minutes later.  She was taken to the Emergency Department for further observation.  In the ED, she was given famotidine, dexamethasone, and 1L of fluids, and her symptoms improved.  She was observed for 2 hours and discharged home with diphenhydramine and cetirizine.

She also experienced shortness of breath.  She stated she took benadryl every 2 hours for the rash which controlled it and monitored herself with the shortness of breath.  She also stated that since she was asthmatic if the shortness of breath would have gotten worse she would have gone to the ER (luckily this wasn&#39;t necessary).

                                                I was vaccinated last Wednesday, March 24, at 8 pm with the Janssen vaccine.  As soon as I was vaccinated (on my left arm), I put on my coat and I felt a brief  and sharp pain in my left arm. And nothing else. On Friday night, I felt a very slight tingling in my left hand. And pain in the upper arm, in the region between the place where the vaccine was applied and my elbow. This pain seemed to spread to the forearm. Since then, I have tingling / numbness in my left hand and forearm and pain throughout my left arm, left shoulder, upper left center of the back and neck. And these pains and numbness have been increasing every day. Ten days have passed since the vaccine was applied and the condition only worsens. I took Voltaren in the last 3 days and the pain has not subsided. I am worried and scared. Was it a case of thrombosis or pulmonary embolism? In addition, I saw in the CDC information that, during the JNJ vaccine tests, there was a case of a severe reaction called brachial neuritis; as I didn?t know what it was, I did a Google search and, apparently, the symptoms I have coincide with those of this disease. Anyway, what do you advise me to do? I have waited until now imagining that the pain and numbness would lessen. But the opposite happened and everything just makes it worse. I look forward to feedback and guidance. I haven&#39;t been to a doctor yet, but it looks like it will be necessary. Thanks.

Heart was racing all day and night, couldn&#39;t sleep on my side because of it. around 24 hours after the shot I felt chest heaviness, which went away after a few minutes. Face was flushed, and I felt clammy. Went to the bathroom more than normal.  Aches  and joint pain, which weren&#39;t too bad.

Then as that passed, my throat began to itch and inside my ears became itchy, then after about 5 minutes or so my tongue started to tingle on the front end and felt thicker at the back. After a total of 20 minutes or so after this started I was home and took a Benadryl, which helped, however after a few hours my face started itching, no rash just an itch and it is still itching after 5 days. It seems to be getting better every day.  It was definitely a similar type of reaction I get from raw pitted fruits.

                                                First night and for about 24 hours very achy, chills, tired and headache. Arm sore where shot given.  Then that went away and on day 3, my arm swelled, was red and hot and had a hard lump.  That has continued and is still there, 10 days later. The swelling and redness is a bit better, but the soreness and heat are still present.

Minor headache and dull aches throughout the body. Had to climb under an electric blanket, comforter and then another blanket on top to get warm and comfortable. As i drifted in and out of sleep through to the morning, I noticed the chills and shivering dissapating and was able to get some sleep. Awake now, still feeling a headache and flu-like aches to the body. Moving very slow. Arm  not really sore at injection site as it was upon receipt of vaccination.

I reported it to two pharmacists at the table where I received the shot and they said they haven?t ever heard of that being a side effect, so just sit for a while and rub it out and stretch it. I felt lightheaded and the sharp pain (take my breath away) pain kept happening every few minutes. I stayed for observation for an hour, and started to feel a little better so I walked to my car. I drove to my pharmacist close to my house to ask her what she would recommend, and she said to try Tylenol . The stabbing pain kept happening on and off all day yesterday, causing weakness in my leg. Today I woke up and it has been achy, tingling, burning And somewhat numb. After researching online whether these symptoms have happened to anyone else, I found that there were some concerns about these symptoms. I?m concerned that it may be Transverse M

These lasted a couple of days.  However, since the day after the vaccine, I have developed severe acid reflux and heartburn.  This occurs every time I eat anything.  I have NEVER in my life had heartburn or acid reflux; only after taking the vaccine.  I also have a heaviness in my chest and cough frequently.

                                                It started with just a pain in the arm - normal soreness from the injection  site and up the left side of my  neck - but then it spread to the whole upper part of my left arm. It was very , very painful. It wakes me up almost every single night because it hurts. The pain will radiate  - now the pain is more in my arm area and now it&#39;s radiating to my back on on the shoulder blade area on the left side - my  neck is a tiny bit sore right. The soreness in the arm is always consistent but the radiating pain moves around somewhat. I am wondering if they gave me the injection incorrectly.  It doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s  what the description of &#34;COVID ARM.&#34; I don&#39;t have any swelling or redness and I haven&#39;t ever.  I take Aleve every now and then. I called the doctor last week and she told me to wait a couple of weeks and watch it.

                                                The day I received the shot, my arm got warm and sore.  The soreness traveled to my shoulder and neck.  I got headachey, alternating between hot and cold chills, a little bit of nausea and extreme tiredness.   This continued for the next 5 days which seemed like they were considered mild reactions according to the CDC website.  Most concerning though, is on day 5, (3/14/21) in the evening as I was getting into bed, I started getting a red, extremely itchy rash on both my arms, my lower back and my upper legs, to the point that I could not sleep because it was so itchy and had to take Benedryl.  I have not changed anything in my diet or in the products I use on my body, so I can only attribute this reaction to this vaccine.  I am still a little itchy on my arms today 3/15/21.   I am also still getting the hot and cold chills and still have a little bit of nausea, not bad, but enough to be &#34;off&#34; certain foods.

I took Benadryl and itch is subsiding. I hope this is the end of side effects!

I developed a very red rash, mostly on my lower legs up to the knees, some slight rash on forearms. I used topical benadryl and it went away, but came back later that day. That lasted 36 - 48 hours and was completely gone.

                                                I received my J&amp;J vaccine on 03-13-2021. On 03-16-2021 I woke up and the left side of my shoulder, both knees, both legs and both feet are inflamed.  I also have cramps to both of my shoulders. On Saturday 03-20-2021 when I woke up my right eye was also inflamed but only lasted one day. I have spasms to my calves with leg cramps. I can not sleep at night due to the inflammation.  I went to see my PCP this morning who prescribed a leg cream for the cramps, but I do not know the name. My blood pressure today in the morning was 154/96.  My doctor said it was a reaction to the vaccine.

                                                Vaccination site became very swollen, red and itchy like a Mosquito bite.  I complained to doctor during a March 22nd visit and then I got the idea to apply Apple Cider Vinegar.  It made the itching stop within 48 hours and the swelling began to go down as well.

I woke up at 1:30am freezing cold and hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t get out of bed. 45 minutes later I managed to get to the bathroom and took my temp which was 103.2. I took more ibuprofen, the fever subsided to 101. I continued having a fever for 2 days along with body aches and feeling very tired. Felt fully recovered after 4 days.

                                                Patient reported to her doctor&#39;s office today with symptoms consistent with Bell&#39;s Palsy.  She stated that the facial symptoms started mid morning today on 4/5/21.  Last week ( week of 3/28 to 4/3) she reports that she felt &#34;weird&#34;.  She felt as if there were cool water running under her skin at all times.  She also states that when anything touches her skin, it feels very cold.  For example, when running her hands under warm water, it feels like ice water on her hands.  When setting her bare arms on her desk, it feels as if they are being set on ice and when her pants rub against her legs it feels as if they are wet and cold.  She also stated that the top 1/3 of her back was tingly and felt as if she had applied Biofreeze to it, but she had put nothing on her back.  Her tip of her tongue feels as if it is &#34;burnt&#34; and she can not tasted anything on the front part of her tongue.  She needs to get things way in the back of her mouth before she can taste them. On 4/3/21 she states that her lips began tingling as if they were having numbing medication wearing off from a dental visit, but she had done nothing different.  On 3/31 her lower back also felt as if it had a pinched nerve.  Today on 4/5/21 she has the Bell&#39;s Palsy on her face that started mid morning and she complains of her nose feeling tingly also.  She also feels as if she is retaining fluid.

The numbness feels like it is about to go to sleep (no pins or needles feelings) I have feeling and grip strength, just feels like it is about to go asleep.    The body rash went away when I took Benadryl when I got home at 11:00 am.    I am still having the numbness in my hand and fingers but not as bad and not as long.  Off and on daily now (1 week out from the vaccine).

                                                Adverse reaction came on rather suddenly around 6 PM, eight hours after injection and progressed rapidly lasting almost 48 hrs.  Started with mild bodyaches that within an  our became moderate, followed by moderate chills, mild headache that came and went over the 48 hours, moderate fatigue, and extremely sore at injection site but no visible redness or bruising.  I did have a fever with the onset of the other symptoms. It started at 99.8 and then over the next 48 hours would fluctuate as high as 100.9 but never dropping below 99.8.

The unexpected effect is tingling and coldness in both hands/fingertips.   I could logically assume it is from the swelling in the neck pressing on the nerves, as I have experienced a similar feeling occasionally in the past due to compressed discs in my spine and neck.  At this point I am not particularly alarmed but I wanted to make you aware of this side effect.

By morning my neck and shoulders were achy as well as my left arm and I was still a little fatigued. By the next day my only symptom was soreness in my upper arm and especially at the injection site.  5 days after the injection I still have soreness at the injection site. I took a few doses of tylenol and rested. My job  has forced a 10 day isolation on me because they said fatigue and achy muscles are signs of COVID-19. So I am getting plenty of rest.

Symptoms remind me of shingles-caused neuralgia which I sometimes experience on left side. Facial tingling, feeling of tightness in muscles, including inner ear are less familiar to me. Symptoms appear to change in degree--slight to more noticeable--as this first day wears on. (Now nearly five hours since vaccine.) I have gone about day as normal, eating and exercising, drinking plenty of water.

                                                At about 23 minutes broke out in a cold sweat. At 26 minutes, became hoarse (always my first symptom of anaphylaxis). Progressed to coughing and feeling a lump in my throat and then tightness in my chest. My blood pressure elevated to 152/100. At that point I self administered epi pen and paramedics called 911. This provided relief but after about 5 to 10 minutes the tightness in my chest and the feeling I couldn?t get a deep breath began to return and the paramedics administered two puffs of an albuteral inhaler and transported me to the hospital. At the ER, they did an EKG, started an IV and administered fluids, prednisone and Benadryl. I was discharged about 90 -120 minutes later with a prescription for 3 days of prednisone (50mg) and instructions to continue to take 25 mg oral Benadryl every 4 hours.  The next morning my face and chest were red and looked like I was sunburned. My face was also swollen.

                                                I got the shot in my left arm and shortly after right above my right eye I could feel a reaction going on. Almost like something effected the muscle, I didn&#39;t say anything and went to the wait room I mentioned it before I left and they said it sounded like a migraine and I went home.  When I raise my face on the right side of my eyebrow area feels like I have spasms. When I got home it moved to my cheek area as well and felt strange.  I got a rash on my right cheek that evening and a super bad headache. I took a Benadryl and went to sleep. I didn&#39;t have a fever.  By the morning the rash was gone, the only thing that bothered me was my eyebrow area ( muscle area) I went to the Dr the following day and she said it sounded like it was my sinuses. Prior to this I was having allergy / sinus issues.

                                                After my vaccine I had tenderness in my right arm at injection site and a sharp pain in my right clavicle bone. The clavicle bone pain slowly went to an ache. But then I noticed my arm was ballooning up a d the injection site was hard. Then, About a week after my COVID vaccine, I experienced leg pain (left) behind my knee and my arm was getting larger and warm to the touch. My first appointment with my doctor was 3/24/2021 at 1215pm. He checked out the areas and ordered a ultrasound Doppler of my left knee. I called the vaccine center as it says on the paper given with the vaccine. I spoke to someone and explained my symptoms. She suggested a ultrasound of my arm as well. I called my primary care doctor who added my arm to the order.

Got up on the seventh day and started again all over my body now, tried cortizone but it is not helping. I haven&#39;t changed anything so figured it had to be from the vaccine. I read where you can get it from the vaccine and it could last 2 to 12 days. Anything else I can use to stop the itching? Will I be okay or should I go to the hospital?

                                                After my J&amp;J vaccine, my right arm felt hot and was red and I also ended up with an upset stomach, had diarrhea and felt sick to my stomach. I also experienced chills, low grade fever of 99.8 and had swelling to my joints in my fingers and toes. My right arm pain radiated upwards to my neck. These symptoms lasted 12 hours and as of today I still have pain in my neck. Since 03-15-2021, I have been seeing a chiropractor for my neck pain. I see him on a weekly basis. At the chiropractor&#39;s office they apply ice, heat and do a muscle rub help with my neck pain that still is present.

                                                Two hours after receiving vaccine, I experienced sudden onset extremely painful throat, swollen gooey uvula, followed by hives on face, neck, chest, and underarms, moderately swollen lips and eye areas. I took Benadryl 1/2 hour after onset, eventually resolving hives and face swelling. 25 hours later, I&#39;m still experiencing the painful throat/swollen uvula issue. Appetite is fine, though swallowing is painful. Injection sight became painful 18-20 hours after vaccination.

She stayed an additional 15 minutes for a total of 30 minutes and at that time said it was better but still existent. She went home with understanding to call 9-1-1 if any symptoms of anaphylaxis.

                                                On March 22nd (8 days after the vaccination I noticed a red bump on my right eyebrow that itched. At first, I thought it was an insect bite. Today, March 22rd, I noticed a red rash on my face (similar to rosacea). My cheeks and ears feel warm to the touch, and I have a mild itch on the entire  area. The rash is more prominent on the right side of the face. This has not happened to me before. I am planning on taking an OTC antiallergic to calm the symptoms.

                                                About 45 minutes after receiving my Covid vaccine I noticed my lower lip started to swell there was no swelling in my throat). I took Benadryl. I needed to continue taking the Benadryl every 4 - 6 hours because the swelling kept coming back. Later I noticed my lungs getting scratchy. I started using my nebulizer to stay ahead of it. I took two Benadryl before going to sleep. When I woke up I noticed my lips starting swell up again and my lungs were still scratchy. I took my peak flow and it have dropped to 345 (my normal is about 375/380). I contacted my Pulmonologist and her recommended that I go to Urgent Care and report my reaction to the CDC. I went to the Urgent Care. The doctor told me to continue with the Benadryl and nebulizer treats and she also added Pepcid and Prednisone.   It is now one week out and I am still experiencing the lip swelling and itchiness on my face  so I am still currently taking the Benadryl. From time to time my lungs my lungs feel scratchy.

A week after vaccine, it hurt to touch my eye - I thought I had pink eye but it wasn&#39;t itchy. I treated it with hot compress. I did that at least 3 times a day for two days. It was really swollen  - lower eye lid of my left eye - right in the middle of it - on the inside of the eyelid I can see a bump in the middle of it and so I was kind of pushing on my eye a little and it looked like fluid was coming out of my tear duct and so I put a hot compress on it often and it&#39;s getting a little better each day. I&#39;m 70% better.

                                                My left arm started to sting immediately after getting the shot, then the stinging subsided.  My left arm started to hurt later in the day and I had pain all the way down my left arm and left side of my chest. This pain throughout my left side was not helped by Ibuprofen and  made sleep very hard.  I had intermittent sharp pain in my neck, shoulder, and left arm for days.  The injection site turned red, hot, and a raised area the size of a silver dollar appeared  and was med-red in color for about 8 days.  The color is better/ almost normal as of today, but still a hard lump under the skin and a bit itchy.  This has caused pain throughout my back and shoulders since I got the shot....but it has not been activity limiting.  I had a slight bit of nausea for a couple of days as well.  My husband had his shot just after mine and experienced  Chills , headache, and nausea at about 9:00 P.M.  His chills subsided at about 3:00 A.M.  He continued with the headache for another day/ fatigue for 2 days/ and nausea for about 5 days.  He has also had tingling in his left arm (about 7 days)  and a funny tingling on his tongue for about a week.

                                                Prior to receiving her COVID-19 vaccine, the patient was already having symptoms from anxiety/nervousness about the vaccine. Patient was given her injection and within 1-2 minutes, she began feeling dizzy and lightheaded. The vaccine administrator came to me (pharmacist on duty) to notify me that she was not feeling well. I went to go check on her and she stated that she felt as though she was going to faint. I advised her to stay seated, asked if she would like an ice pack and water, and stepped out to get those for her while remaining vigilant (because I wanted to be in the same room as her for observation/safety). I brought her the ice pack, she held it on her chest and head and said it felt nice. After about a minute I stepped out again to ask a technician to get a water for her. When I came back, the patient was still seated but had a blank stare and her mouth was slightly open. I repeated her name out loud and nudged her shoulder several times, however the patient was unresponsive completely. I immediately looked for the red emergency kit in the consultation room but did not see one (I later found out that there was an EpiPen on the table in the room, but I did not see it at the time due to the urgency of the situation). I rushed back into the pharmacy, told the technicians to call 911, and took an EpiPen off the shelf in the pharmacy. I ran back into the room and the patient&#39;s face was very red, her eyes were bulging slightly, and it looked like she was trying to reach her hand up or move it, but was unable to. I injected her with the EpiPen immediately, and within roughly 5 seconds she came back to consciousness and looked at me and said &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34;. EMS arrived extremely fast and was there a few minutes after using the EpiPen. She was then taken by ambulance to the hospital. Patient had a friend, with her at the store who was scheduled to receive the vaccine as well, but after the incident she decided otherwise. Later that evening I gave patient&#39;s friend a phone call to check and see how patient was doing, and to also let her know that patient&#39;s vaccination card was at the pharmacy if she wanted to pick it up. That evening around 6:30-7pm, patient&#39;s husband came to the pharmacy to get her card, he updated us that she was being discharged from the hospital and that she was okay.

I got up and walked back over to my waiting chair and my Husband got up and received his vaccine.    Besides the pain in my left arm,  I started feeling weird tingling sensations and spaced out.  When my Husband sat back down next to me,  my stomach had a burning sensation and I felt slightly nauseated.  Then I felt like I was about to faint.  My Husband and the Staff kept me from falling, The Staff brought ice packs to put on my neck.  They said I turned white and profusely sweat.   I don&#39;t remember all of it, my Husband filled in the blanks.  I started feeling better and we left @4:30.

I got the vaccine at 9am.  around 4pm that afternoon i started feeling sick.  by 7:30pm I was in bed thinking I was going die!   By midnight, I got up and tried to walk to the stairs but i was to weak to walk.  I could not sleep.  I was up for 36 hours!  I was nauseous, dizzy, weak, exhausted.  Every inch of my body had pain!!!  I was tingling all over.  I  had the chills until midnight.  My heart would race and then stop... then race again... I was having difficulty breathing!  I tried standing up but I couldn&#39;t.  I would have driven myself to the emergency room but I couldn&#39;t walk.  by noon the next day, my heart regulated, I was able to breath easier.  I was still exhausted and full of pain and tingling.  Today, I still have some pain, but no tingling.

And then about midweek, I was starting to walk downstairs at work and I had to grab onto rails so I wouldn&#39;t fall - had become so dizzy. I tried to get into my regular doctor -  he was full until April 5. I went into walk-in clinic - I  had to grab onto a board there (dizzy) and they told me to get to ER. My heart was rapid heart beat by time I got to ER. They had to give me wheelchair so I wouldn&#39;t fall over to go into the ER room. Horrible bruising on wrist - because the first IV didn&#39;t take. They gave me a bag of fluids - and gave me Meclizine to help dizziness subside and two Tylenols for headache. I&#39;m taking 3  (per day)- 25 mg chewable HCI Meclizine. If symptoms aren&#39;t as bad I just take a half of one. Still needing the medication because I still have the pressure in the ear comes up and I need to take the Meclizine and Benadryl to get the pressure to go down.

My finger tips on my left arm went numb, same arm where I received the shot.  By the time I got home  I had a headache, so I took some tylenol.   My mouth is dry on and off. They told me to drink water and Gatorade  I slept for about 5 hours. I feel better but I still have a dry mouth.  The next morning my arm was swollen and itchy around the injection. I used an ice pack for the swelling.  About 24 hours later I was sweating on and off and my headache continued. I took another tylenol. And my body muscles were hurting.  I did not see a physician during any of the episodes.  It&#39;s the morning of March 23rd and I feel okay today.

Then late afternoon on 3/22/21 got skin rash on both arms, took 1 Benadryl, seemed to help/clear a bit.  Next day in afternoon, rash appeared on both upper thighs, lower buttocks, arms; few hours later some clearing of upper thighs/buttocks, but then rash appeared on inner thighs and calves.  Took 2 Benadryl and used hydrocortisone cream on rash.  Nose looked red. Overnight rash spread to ankles and feet.  It feels like rash is moving around my body - other than stomach, upper back and neck.  This morning 03/24, feet have cleared, but still on inner thigh left leg.  Right leg is almost clear.   I have photos if needed.

That evening she was taken to the Cath Lab and had an IVC filter placed. The next day patient began to have paresthesias and discoloration of the right lower extremity.  Ultrasound showed high-grade occlusion of the right proximal superficial femoral artery.  Patient was pre-treated with platelets and  taken back to Cath Lab emergently.  In addition to the right SFA there is also thrombotic occlusion of bilateral iliacs.  Patient had bilateral thrombectomy and bilateral common iliac stent placement. The following day developed gross hematuria.

Larger veins were visible at the surface, pronounced, raised in a ridge about the size of my finger...at least 6-8 veins across each thigh.  There were literally waves of swollen flesh. Very unusual, in fact, the way they looked was very scary. There was no pain or aching at the time. I elevated legs, iced them, took a diuretic for the next 3 days and they eventually deflated. Following few days had aching from waist down. Nothing since.
