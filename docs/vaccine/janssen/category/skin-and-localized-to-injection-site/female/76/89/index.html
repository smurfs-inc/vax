                                                SEVERE PAIN at the injection site, beginning two weeks after the injection.   It&#39;s excruciating, so I&#39;ve been lying on the couch for 7 days so far, with no end in sight.  It kills me to move my arm, so I only get up to use the bathroom.  I&#39;m taking 1000 mgs of Tylenol and 200 mgs of Motrin every 8 hours with very little effect (if any).  I&#39;ve called my doctor twice, but they said they can&#39;t do anything unless I go in, which is impossible because of the pain.  The nurse said they probably couldn&#39;t do anything, anyway,

She hit her left eye and left temple resulting in a bump and a bruise.  Patient opened her eyes when I called her name and she was not aware of were she was. Her blood pressure was 95/64 65 bpm laying down and 70/54 114 bpm when sitting. We laid her back down because she was feeling dizzy and the Ambulance arrives 45 mins after called. Because of her bump and her low BP she was taken to the hospital.

                                                My mother reported feeling numbness/tingling in her left fingers/hand on the drive home approximately 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  She wanted to go straight home.  When we got home she reported that the numbness had been felt in her head and tongue and it was a very weird feeling.  She was numb on her entire left side.  It seemed to resolve after a while.  She is still very tired and has a low heart rate, but normal blood oxygenation.  There is no visible swelling or reaction at the vaccine site. She still has some slight numbness on the left side.  She may call the doctor tomorrow if there is still some concern.
