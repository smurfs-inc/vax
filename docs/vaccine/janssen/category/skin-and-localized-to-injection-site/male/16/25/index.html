                                                After a few hours, developed a low grade headache and some soreness at the injection site.  About two hours later I started getting extremely cold, despite the temperature in the mid-high 70s. I covered up under blankets. I began feeling very tired and a general sick feeling. After about an hour and a half of progressively worse chills and cold sweat, I began to get very very hot and removed all blankets and eventually clothes. I took my temperature, which was at 102 f. At this point I drank some water and Gatorade and waited for it to pass. I also noticed that my Apple Watch heart rate detection was saying my heart rate was in the high 90s to low 100s despite me just laying in bed. This was alarming because my typical resting heart rate is in the low 60s. About two hours later I felt well enough to at least brush my teeth, but upon standing up was greeted with an extreme feeling of weakness and dizziness and it was hard to keep myself up right. I eventually was able to fall asleep, and upon waking up, felt better, but still not great. My heart rate was more normal at this point, I no longer had chills or a fever, but still had a headache and soreness across my body, worst at the injection site.

Roughly hour 28 extreme lung pressure, new bruising and patching red dots on palms of hands.  A phone call was made to a Covid help line and determined an ER visit was needed ASAP.  ER visit determined an extremely elevated INR, but chest xray was clear.

Random bouts of tinnitus in both ears, switching off, never both ears at once. The arm pain and swelling in shot area lasted about two days,  but the nausea, ;over pain, and fatigue continued for the better part of 4 days after the shot. The tinnitus only happened a couple times about 1-3 hours after the vaccination then ceased. I did not get this verified by a doctor, but I suspect my liver pain was related to an inflammation in the liver associated with the vaccine, as in the past, pain around my liver area has been associated with inflammation of my liver during minor flare ups.

                                                Client had a J&amp;J vaccine at 1327. He reported that he was having trouble breathing around 1333. He reported that he felt hot and sweaty and lightheaded. He appeared distressed. We called 911, then we provided a client with a cold pack. His pulse was 47 bpm and his spO2 was 97%. He continued to state that he was lightheaded so we had him lay down on the ground and take deep breaths. EMS arrived they collected his vitals which were WNL. His blood glucose was 71. He was warm and moist to the touch. EMS stayed with the client until 1350 at which point he had sat up and sat in the chair. He said he was definitely not having trouble breathing anymore and was feeling better. Provided client with a juice box and water. Client stayed onsite until 1410 at which point he said he felt comfortable leaving.  Client walked unassisted out of the clinic.

                                                Immediately after sitting down in the waiting area after receiving the shot, the pt reported feeling a strange pressure in their arm. Following this, the patient described the sensation of &#34;blanking out&#34;. The pt fell off their chair and lacked alert conconciousness for roughly five seconds. When the pt came to, they appeared confused and twitchy, with wide eyes and an overall appearance of shock. Pt remained in their state for roughly a minute, before stating that they felt completely better. The pt had developed a sweaty back but didn&#39;t state that they felt overally hot. They didn&#39;t mention being in any pain. The local injection site appeared a bit red but nothing of significant note. Pt did bump their head on the side wall behind the chair, receiving a minor bruise. Pt was given some water to drink and was monitored for 30 minutes. They pt stated they felt fine. They had no past history of fainting with vaccines, thought pt claimed to have passed out like this before but only after suffering a head injury. After their wait, the pt was allowed to leave and assured us that they felt completely fine.

                                                High fever, extreme shaking and chills, nausea. I was pretty much immobile from 11pm-3am (until I was able to fall asleep) on the day of vaccination (3/8/21). This happened immediately after I showered with hot water. The next day  (3/9/21) until around 8pm I had a high fever, chills (not as bad but still pretty bad), headache, nausea, fatigue, and extreme muscle/joint pain particularly in my back and arms. I was unable to work, go to school, or do homework the entire day. After 8pm, I was down to a 100.4 fever and slight chills with mild nausea and fatigue. Today (3/10/21), I have mild muscle pain in my back and near the injection site. I took 400mg of ibuprofen every 6-8 hours from 3:00pm 3/8/21 (day of injection) to present with mild effects on pain and fever levels. I?m an infrequent user of ibuprofen. If I didn?t have someone with me the first night after the vaccination (3/8/21) I would have gone to the hospital.

Patient was fine immediately post administration in the IMZ room but witness stated he fell sideways (within a few minutes of receiving the vaccine) out of post-administration observation chair (which is in front of the pharmacy). Technician called code white and patient was immediately met with management and the pharmacy team. Patient was laying on his stomach on the floor, supporting himself upward with both hands/forearms. Patient had blood dripping from forehead and nose. Gauze was applied to laceration on forehead to help with bleeding and once patient was able to roll over on his back, an ice pack was applied to his forehead/nose area. Patient said he felt &#34;pain&#34; after the injection and then he felt light-headed. He remembered blacking out for a few seconds. Patient stated he felt &#34;ok&#34;, then later stated he felt better but just had a bad headache. Patient stated he felt &#34;it starting to hurt&#34; and that it triggered his anxiety. Dad was in the store and arrived a few minutes later; dad said son/patient has a &#34;fear of needles&#34; and &#34;he hasn&#39;t had anything to eat today in quite awhile&#34;. EMS arrived to examine patient and asked him if he needed to go to the ER; dad felt going to the ER was for the best since they had a 3 hour car ride home. Paramedics then transported patient to the ER and said he would likely need a stitch for the cut above his eyebrow.

His skin color was pale and when I went up to see how he was he bent over and vomited. After he vomited he said he felt a lot better. I asked him to remain seated and asked for my tech in the pharmacy to call 911, but he then said no and that he was feeling better. He said he felt clammy just before he vomited. I asked him to stay seated and got him some cold water. He remained in the waiting area another 15 minutes after to make sure no further problems. After 15 minutes he was feeling fine and I reassessed and his color returned to his skin and I noticed some redness around inner portion of both thighs, but he said that was from his eczema and that it was there already.  Allowed him to leave at 1:15pm and told him to seek medical attention right away if he felt any issues regarding trouble breathing. I called him an hour later to check up on him at 1:30pm and he was feeling fine. He thanked me over the phone.

                                                It is now the next day, and I feel significantly better. I have pain at the injection site, some muscle fatigue, a little bit of a depleted appetite, tiredness in my eyes and head (likely due to lack of quality sleep), and a bit of sweating, but my pain has reduced to maybe a 2/10 or 1/10 (i.e., not even uncomfortable). I did end up getting decent sleep between 2 AM and 12 PM with only a few interruptions of family members checking on me. The only notable pain that is worrying me is abnormal soreness in my right wrist that is not the result of overuse, overextension, etc., although I was able to take care of that pain with another 3 Advil pills. I am considering scheduling a doctor&#39;s appointment, as I know the J&amp;J vaccine got recalled today for blood clots. My assumption is that because I am a healthy 20-year-old, my immune system overreacted to the vaccine, but I want to check to make sure that it doesn&#39;t cause any additional health problems.

                                                Got chills, muscle aches, headache, hives on day shot administered. 12 days later started seeing defined red and purple splotches, started on hands and palms, spread over my entire body over the next 2 days.  Splotches were dark purple.  Went to clinic, they were unsure of the cause.  Waited a day and then went to another clinic where they thought it might be Coxsackievirus, except there were no sores in the mouth and the splotches were on the palms and pads of the feet.  The splotches faded over the next 2 weeks, the last place they were visible were on the upper arm,  torso and thighs.

                                                Shortly after taking the Jassen COVID-19 vaccine (4 days), I started noticing sporadic bumps appearing on my skin starting on my hands and slowly spreading down my arms, followed by my chest, and finally spreading to my private area.  These bumps slowly started developing into a rash with my chest being the main area that&#39;s affected. As this progressed I went to the doctor&#39;s office on April 5th to see what could be done. The doctor prescribed me 25mg of Banophen (Diphenhydramine) with instructions to take one pill every six hours to ease the pain. Unfortunately, the bumps have continued to spread sporadically throughout my body, the rash gets worse every night, and the itching is constant.

                                                Recieved Jannsen vaccine at 11:15 AM on March 23rd. Rash on hands, arms, feet, and legs appeared at 5:00 PM on May 3rd. It itched and burned and was difficult to sleep. No medication was taken, but by morning the rash was nearly gone and by midday it seemed to be gone. Around 5:00 PM, it started back again. I took Diphenhydramine because it appeared to be an allergic reaction. This helped me get to sleep. It was gone in the morning again, but started back in the evening again. This happened repeatedly for a total of 5 days.

Tuesday after the vaccine I got diarrhea with constipation along side the fatigue. Those symptoms lasted throughout Thursday. Friday night after the vaccine I got small haves around my head, neck, and upper back that would not away after an hour or two. That continued throughout Saturday and midday trough Sunday. Sunday I had shortness of breath after moving some water bottle cases around and lightheadedness along with the small hives at around 2pm I went to the ER to get checked out. Doctors said it was a reaction caused  by the vaccine. They gave me Benadryl for the reaction and injected me with a &#34;Steroid&#34; to the my upper buttock. I don&#39;t remember the name of what they injected with me. It is now Monday April 19th a day after the ER and I feel much better. The Benadryl made the  hives go away.

The patients temperature at 8:30pm was 100.4 F. The patient then went to bed at 9pm. Patient had trouble falling asleep due to fever, shaking, aching. The patient slept intermittently until midnight. At midnight, the patient noticed the fever and shaking had ceased but the headache and aching were still strong. The aching was all over the body. The patients eyes hurt to move. The aching was constant and at times was throbbing. At 3am the patient could still not sleep well so he took 650 mg of Acetaminophen by mouth. The patient began to notice some relief approximately 30-60 min after. The patient fell asleep after the relief began and slept soundly til 9:15 am, April 11th. The patient awoke feeling much better. All side effects had stopped with the exception of a feeling of weakness and slight dizziness. The patient was able to carry on normally and took no more medications.

At 14 hours after vaccination, major aches and soreness, chills and fever rose to 101.2. By 1:00am fever had reached 103.0F (all temperatures taken with ear thermometer). I took 1000mg of Tylenol at that time, which greatly reduced the aches and pains. Woke up with a temp of 99.2, minor aches, almost all effects had subsided.

It appears to be concentrated in my left ear, although it&#39;s hard to tell. There&#39;s a consistent high-pitched tone that won&#39;t go away. I&#39;m not entirely sure when it started (maybe 24-36 hours after receiving the vaccine), but it&#39;s gotten slightly worse since then and is more noticeable. I have not been able to go to the doctor yet.

                                                I got th eJassen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA at 10:50am. When the needle was removed, blood ran down my arm. That has never happened, but it might have been the nurse. I had nausea for a few minutes afterwards, but I think that was due to the blood. I didn&#39;t feel like eating after the shot. Hours later, around 5pm or so, I started to feel hypersensitive and weak. I also started to have a fever that went up to 102.2 farenheit before decided to take ibuprofen.  I had shakes, a heartbeat of 146, and a headache. It lasted all through the night and into the next day. Around 11:20am, whenever I moved my head, I would feel pain in my head. By the end of this day, I started to feel more like myself. By the start of the third day, all I had was pain in my left arm from the shot. It was strange that the pain got worse from Day 1 to Day 3, but that might be from how the vaccine was given and the blood that ran down my arm at that time. Another thing is my appetite has gone down a lot. I don&#39;t want to eat and when I do, I just want to stop. It&#39;s been a couple days, so I&#39;m hoping my appetite will come back.

I had a fever of 101 all day long, a headache, my body was aching from head to toe, extreme lethargy, and occasional bouts of extreme nausea as well as throwing up twice. As of the following day (March 18), almost two days since receiving the shot, I feel pretty much completely normal again aside from a slight headache and some pain at the injection site still. I experienced some pretty bad side effects that only really lasted a day.

The fatigue continued for several hours until about 6-8 hours after vaccination. At that point I started to experience chills, muscle aches, and rash on my left arm (at injection site region) and over other parts of my body. Temperature at that time was still within normal range but close to 10 hours after I began to run a fever. Highest temperature at its peak was 100.3F. These symptoms continued into the night but began to considerably subside in the morning, close to 24 hours after vaccination. At this point, 26 hours after, I still feel mild muscle aches and a mild headache.

                                                At roughly 6 days after vaccination my body developed Hives head to toe. Roughly 18 or so hours after initial hive development I sought treatment for a anaphylactic reaction in my throat and face area. I received a steroid and a Pepcid to calm it down, and was given an epi pen and sent on my way. The following now two plus weeks since then I&#39;ve had episodes of dizziness, shortness of breath and headaches that seem to be constant. There has been almost no relief from these symptoms, however the rash has completely resided. I&#39;ve taken an Aspirin in the mornings to deal with the headaches but strenuous activity seems to bring these on much more prominently.

                                                On Monday 4/12/21, 5 days after taking the J&amp;J vaccine, I had an extremely itchy and painful full body rash. It was big red bumps like mosquito bites all over my body including legs, back, arms, chest, stomach, etc..I could not sleep all night due to the pain and itch and had to constantly apply cortisone cream as well as ice to make the pain bearable. The rash went away almost completely the following morning but then returned again the following night. I have never had any prior allergies or skin conditions and worry that this may become a recurring event since it has now happened for 2 nights. I did hear that a rash at the injection site was a possible side effect from the covid vaccines but this was way worse as it was all over my entire body.

He did say that he had not eaten and it was 3:00pm. paramedics soon arrived and removed the patient from the scene.  I did text patient the next day and he said only that he had a sore arm and symptoms consistent with having a vaccine administered.

                                                About 9 hours after getting my vaccine, I started noticing my temperature rising to ~99.0. About 1 hour later (12 AM), it had risen to ~103. I also noticed my heart rate was extremely high (on average 140 bpm, the highest was 225 bpm); this was also accompanied by chest pains which seemed like they were on the right side of my heart; I also had difficulty controlling my bladder and would randomly start to urinate. I had taken two Advil then slept.  The next day (~9 am) my fever went down but 3 hours later it had gone back up to ~101, I eventually kept cooling myself (removing shirt, fan on high, etc.) and took one Advil and my temperature started to get normal.  For about two days after that, I had pain in my left shoulder - but this was where the injection took place so I wasn&#39;t too worried. Currently I am feeling fine, but the initial day getting the vaccine was quite harrowing - I was quite worried I was going to have a heart attack.

I drove my car to the emergency room and was treated for a allergic reaction given steroids and Benadryl through IV.

The side effects started approximately 12 hours after receiving the vaccine and were done approximately 24 hours after starting. The exception is the pain at the injection side which continued for an additional 12 hours.

                                                Thursday 4/8: 3:20pm: COVID injection given in right arm  Friday 4/9: ~1:00 am: woke up shaking with chills and severely cold; had slight headache. Had insomnia all night.   6:00 am: woke up with bad headache, slight fever.   7:00 am: got out of bed and had vertigo and was running into walls trying to walk to my living room, along with the worst migraine I?ve ever had. Also had dizziness, nausea,  chills, 100&#43;degree fever, aches, skin sensitive to touch, and severe tinnitus. All of the veins were visibly popping out of my head.   As the day went on, everything got worse. Any time I moved, my head would throb so bad that I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital.   3:45 pm:  the headache started to finally go away. It would only hurt if I moved fast. At this point my fever was only slightly high, about 99 degrees. I was still unstable when I walked and dizzy. I went from being super cold, to being super hot and sweaty. And I was alternating between cold &amp; hot and sweaty for the rest of the night. Was also having some memory issues, repeating things when I was having a conversation with someone over the phone.   I was sweating all night when I was sleeping.   Saturday 4/10: 7:00am: woke up with a slight headache; still out of it and dizzy.   8:00am: after being awake for about an hour or so, I looked in the mirror and my whole face (around the lips, cheeks, and jawline, and under the eyes) was really swollen and puffy. My face was even mis-colored. Under my eyes was purple and yellow, and my cheeks were white.   Some confusion persisted throughout the day as well as dizziness.

                                                One week after receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, several small bruises (6-8) appeared on the back of my left leg. Throughout the day, my leg developed a soreness that, after reading a 10 Feb 2021 story in the newspaper about COVID vaccine recipients developing immune thrombocytopenia caused me to seek medical treatment in the afternoon of 4/6/2020. I first visited an urgent care facility where my high blood pressure (130/98) combined with my slight lightheadedness, soreness in the leg and observes bruising were enough for the tending physician to recommend rushing to the ER for bloodwork to be performed immediately. I was admitted to the ER in the early evening with an elevated blood pressure (~150/111) and the bruising still prevalent. The tending nurse practitioner authorized a complete blood count (CBC) and discharged me an hour later when the results came back ?extremely close to normal,? noting that my platelet count of 194 was no immediate cause for concern. Since then, the bruising and soreness has subsided.

I also noticed short-term memory loss and mood changes from feeling of Happy and sad and angry from around 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.  and the feeling of complete uselessness and regretting getting the vaccine to the point I wanted to cry saying oh I made a mistake. Almost as if my body was trying to tell me this was a mistake.  Throughout the evening the all over muscle soreness and headache and fever seem to be getting worse I even woke up in the middle of night between 2:00 and 3:00 a.m. and took Tylenol PM to help go back to bed.   Started feeling better later in the afternoon on April 2nd. Almost if everything went away and back to normal.   I have noticed that I have been having more head pain (I normally have none) than normal since receiving the vaccine.

                                                In the span of about 40 minutes following the shot, I had severe reactions. I initially felt really warm in my arm and my heart started to race for a bit. That subsided pretty quickly. Then I got really dizzy, lightheaded and warm and sweaty while waiting the 15 minutes. Then my vision started to blur and I felt tingly in both of my hands and both of my legs. According to others with me, I also went grey. I was given a cool cloth and fanned which helped with a lot of the issues. I also had my legs elevated and was given some slightly sugary food and drink to help the vaccine disperse better. Paramadics and amabulance arrived to assess me. I was improving by the time they arrived and was deemed stable, so I did not go to the hospital for this incident

                                                Unsure if related to vaccine but timing is very suspect. I am 25 years old and in good health but developed Shingles on 4/17/2021  (diagnosed at the emergency room on 4/20). Due to the very low likelihood of shingles at the age of 25 and my good health history I figured it could be worth a submission / a data point in the event others are experiencing the same.
