                                                Patient reported running a fever last night after getting vaccinated yesterday afternoon. She did not have any rashes on her face till she threw up this afternoon and then she stated that she had rashes all over her face and it was itchy. I advised her to take some antihistamine and she had cetirizine 10mg at home and she took one tablet. And then I advised her to go to the ER.

                                                High fever, extreme shaking and chills, nausea. I was pretty much immobile from 11pm-3am (until I was able to fall asleep) on the day of vaccination (3/8/21). This happened immediately after I showered with hot water. The next day  (3/9/21) until around 8pm I had a high fever, chills (not as bad but still pretty bad), headache, nausea, fatigue, and extreme muscle/joint pain particularly in my back and arms. I was unable to work, go to school, or do homework the entire day. After 8pm, I was down to a 100.4 fever and slight chills with mild nausea and fatigue. Today (3/10/21), I have mild muscle pain in my back and near the injection site. I took 400mg of ibuprofen every 6-8 hours from 3:00pm 3/8/21 (day of injection) to present with mild effects on pain and fever levels. I?m an infrequent user of ibuprofen. If I didn?t have someone with me the first night after the vaccination (3/8/21) I would have gone to the hospital.

Pt did not lose consciousness but blacked out (visual disturbances, tinnitus/temporary hearing loss, nausea) occurred within 2-3 minutes of administration. First attempt to read BP was low (~80/60). Pt is an athlete, so I waited until after water was consumed to take BP again. 2nd reading was ~106/65. Pt felt better after drinking water and after sitting for 15 minutes under observation.

                                                Starting about 12 hours after my vaccine, I started to feel fatigue and body aches.  An hour after that I experienced intense chills and a sense of dread. I put a heater on myself with two layers of thick blankets, but it didn&#39;t help. My fingers and parts of my face started to tingle and go numb and I couldn&#39;t fall asleep in spite of me doing breathing exercises and lying down. Eventually the chills turned into a fever and my body temperature suddenly shot up. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer, but it was certainly over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Despite my relief from the chills, I still couldn&#39;t sleep.  I wasn&#39;t remarkably stressed/anxious, I just couldn&#39;t get to sleep. I&#39;m not typically an insomniac, and upon speaking to others who received the same vaccine, they&#39;ve also reported intense chills and an inability to fall asleep.

                                                Fatigue around 10 hours after initial vaccination. Radiating ache and joint pain from the injection site. After 12 hours, temperature reached 99.7 F.  At 14 hours after vaccination, major aches and soreness, chills and fever rose to 101.2. By 1:00am fever had reached 103.0F (all temperatures taken with ear thermometer). I took 1000mg of Tylenol at that time, which greatly reduced the aches and pains. Woke up with a temp of 99.2, minor aches, almost all effects had subsided.

I had a fever of 101 all day long, a headache, my body was aching from head to toe, extreme lethargy, and occasional bouts of extreme nausea as well as throwing up twice. As of the following day (March 18), almost two days since receiving the shot, I feel pretty much completely normal again aside from a slight headache and some pain at the injection site still. I experienced some pretty bad side effects that only really lasted a day.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Roughly 1 hour after vaccination I started to experience nausea and fatigue. The fatigue continued for several hours until about 6-8 hours after vaccination. At that point I started to experience chills, muscle aches, and rash on my left arm (at injection site region) and over other parts of my body. Temperature at that time was still within normal range but close to 10 hours after I began to run a fever. Highest temperature at its peak was 100.3F. These symptoms continued into the night but began to considerably subside in the morning, close to 24 hours after vaccination. At this point, 26 hours after, I still feel mild muscle aches and a mild headache.

                                                At roughly 6 days after vaccination my body developed Hives head to toe. Roughly 18 or so hours after initial hive development I sought treatment for a anaphylactic reaction in my throat and face area. I received a steroid and a Pepcid to calm it down, and was given an epi pen and sent on my way. The following now two plus weeks since then I&#39;ve had episodes of dizziness, shortness of breath and headaches that seem to be constant. There has been almost no relief from these symptoms, however the rash has completely resided. I&#39;ve taken an Aspirin in the mornings to deal with the headaches but strenuous activity seems to bring these on much more prominently.

On April 3rd he had non-specific changes in his hands that he attributed to cold weather that led to discomfort when running them under warm water. By monday APril 5th he was having worsening sensitivity in his hands and feet to heat, touch and experienced numbness. he also began to have difficulty walking. He went to the ER April 6th and was discharged April 7th after undergoing MRI of the brain and spinal cord, labs and lumbar puncture, with a presumptive diagnosis of early Guillain-barre Syndrome. His symptoms continued to worse, loss of gait was more pronounced as well as loss of balance and new off sensations in his tongue. He was admitted to the hospital, continued to undergo diagnostic workout. Results from tests on APril 6th came back positive for Anti nuclear antibodies and high protein in his CSF. He was treated with 3 days of infused Immunoglobolin therapy and was discharged on April 11th with a diagnosis of likely GBS. His symptoms continue to worsen slightly, but with less day to day decline

The side effects started approximately 12 hours after receiving the vaccine and were done approximately 24 hours after starting. The exception is the pain at the injection side which continued for an additional 12 hours.

                                                One week after receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, several small bruises (6-8) appeared on the back of my left leg. Throughout the day, my leg developed a soreness that, after reading a 10 Feb 2021 story in the newspaper about COVID vaccine recipients developing immune thrombocytopenia caused me to seek medical treatment in the afternoon of 4/6/2020. I first visited an urgent care facility where my high blood pressure (130/98) combined with my slight lightheadedness, soreness in the leg and observes bruising were enough for the tending physician to recommend rushing to the ER for bloodwork to be performed immediately. I was admitted to the ER in the early evening with an elevated blood pressure (~150/111) and the bruising still prevalent. The tending nurse practitioner authorized a complete blood count (CBC) and discharged me an hour later when the results came back ?extremely close to normal,? noting that my platelet count of 194 was no immediate cause for concern. Since then, the bruising and soreness has subsided.
