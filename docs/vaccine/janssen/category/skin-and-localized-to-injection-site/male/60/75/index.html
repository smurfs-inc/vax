                                                Roughly a week following vaccination he cut his hand and was unable to stop the bleeding. 2 days later he developed mucosal lesions inside his mouth which began to bleed without resolution. He also cut himself shaving with prolonged bleeding. Following this event his rehabilitation center performed a CBC and he was found to be profoundly thrombocytopenic with platelets of 7. He presented to hospital where he was transfused with platelets which did not resolve his thrombocytopenia. He was transfused 2 more units with immediate CBC followup which did not improve his platelets; this was very suggestive of a consumptive process. Hematology was consulted and per their recommendations steroids were started. After initiation of systemic IV medrol platelet count began to rise. Per our hematology team, most likely culprit is the COVID vaccine. Patient had no medication changes, had been stable in his chronic conditions, and had never had any autoimmune or thrombocytopenic event before this time.

Within a few days the itching spread to my entire back.  By 30Jan21 i saw my primary care physician and a light rash was presenting on my back and chest.  I was prescribed some cetirizine for itching.  By Saturday 3Apr i had a full blown body rash on my chest, back, down my arms and down to my thighs.  My doctor described it as angry red and indicated it appeared to potentially be some type of allergic reaction to a drug.  On this date 13Apr, the rash has subsided but some itching continues.

I sat upright for about 1.5 hrs and respiration returned to a normal rhythm at which time I was comfortable enough to return to bed.  I did not seek medical attention but monitored closely during that time and was prepared to go to the ER if necessary.  As I write this I am at 22 hrs post vaccination.  Respiration is fine, I have some discomfort at the injection site, a slight headache and some aches and pains which is expected.

Slight headache. Awake the morning of 3/11 and symptoms had subsided.

That said, i&#39;ve never had an allergic reaction to anything and have not changed anything in my diet or hygiene habits.  Beginning yesterday around 5 pm, both of my arms became splotchy and itchy.  As the evening progressed, the rash was all over my body.  The &#34;splotchiness&#34; eased after a few hours, but I remained &#34;itchy&#34; throughout the night.  This morning it&#39;s better, but I&#39;m still slightly &#34;itchy&#34; in my extremities, particularly around my ankles and hands.  I have not contacted a Dr, as it appears to be getting significantly better on its own.   Just thought I would let you know in case it&#39;s something that others are experiencing.

                                                The injection itself was high on my arm and was very painful as it was administered (much more so than a typical vaccination in the arm).  The pain has been persistent, and has gotten worse over time.  No fever, no inflammation at the injection site other than a red dot that resolved over about one week.  On advice of my physician (nurse practitioner) I&#39;ve been icing the shoulder three times a day and taking ibuprofen 800 mg q 6h - this has not led to any improvement - to the contrary the pain is getting worse and the shoulder is losing substantial mobility.    Something seems to have been done wrong - and am wondering if the injection itself was given in the shoulder or tendon rather than intramuscularly.

AFTER ABOUT 10 MIN MY TECHNICIAN NOTICED HIM SIT ON THE FLOOR FROM HIS CHAIR AND SHE CAME TO GET ME.  AS I APPROACED HIM HE LOOKED DAZED AND SUDDENLY BLACKED OUT.  IN ABOUT 15-20 SECONDS HE AWOKE AND ABOUT 1 MINUTE LATER HE WAS SPEAKING.  ROUGHLY 5 MINUTES LATER, EMS ARRIVED AND CHECKED HIS VITALS, BLOOD SUGAR AND EKG.  ALL WERE WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS.  WHILE TALKING TO PATIENT AND THE TWO LADIES WITH HIM, WE FOUND OUT HE HAD DRIVEN 3 HOURS FROM HIS HOME TO COME TO OUR PHARMACY FOR THEM TO GET VACCINATED.  AND THEY PLANNED TO GET ON THE ROAD AND RETURN.  EMS SUGGESTED HE GO TO THE HOSPITAL, BUT AFTER 20 MINUTES HE WAS WALING AND TALKING AND DRINKING WATER.  HE AND HIS FRIENDS DECIDED THEY WOULD NOT GO TO THE HOSPITAL.  I FOLLOWED UP WITH HIM 2 DAYS LATER ON  4/9 AND HE FELT FINE EXCEPT FOR SORENESS AT THE SITE OF INJECTION.  HE ALSO RECALLED A TIME WHEN HE HAD PASSED OUT FROM AN INJECTION WHEN HE WAS A TEENAGER

                                                After my vaccine, I experienced redness sensation to my arm. My left arm was swollen and raised bump with a rash. I called my doctor and he thought it was possible cellulitis. He prescribed Prednisone and an antibiotic for seven days. After the seven days my rash was gone but I still had the raised bump. I went to an urgent care facility where they performed an ultrasound of left upper extremity and no blood clot was found. I was told to apply warm compresses to my left arm once a day. To this day I still have an aching sensation to my left arm and is also sore and my left arm is still red but flat in shape.

                                                Got heaviness in chest and ring finger turned white and numb around 8:30 a.m.   Got heaviness in chest again around 6:00 p.m. and it would not subside so I went to the ER and they gave me 3 nitroglycerin and did several tests to check my heart but could not find anything wrong.  I am scheduled for a stress test April  20. The person in the bed next to me had similar symptoms and received he Janssen vaccine the same day I did but about 10 minutes earlier.

Subsequently, I had unusual bruising at IV site for CT scan with contrast greater than one week,  site of blood draw for testing and Power Port IV site for immunotherapy both greater than one week. I have been cancer patient with these treatments regularly for many years and this bruising and length is not normal. Additional information, Heparin is administered to flush port after treatment.

                                                I received the Janssen vaccine on March 13.  By the next weekend, I had what I thought was a spider bite on the inside of my left thigh.  That &#34;bite&#34; got worse--bigger, hot to the touch, and then red.  On the weekend of the 27-28 of March, it was red, raised and very painful even when not touched.     I called my family doctor on Monday morning, the 29th of March, and I was sent to the Emergency Room, where I was diagnosed with a 7cm thrombosis in my left greater saphenous vein, which is treated the same as a DVT.    I was treated first with Lovenox injections, then Eliquis 10 mg 2x daily, now 5 mg 2x daily.    The blood clot is still painful to the touch.

                                                Started at 430 am on the 13th of April, my stomach started hurting. It does not matter if or what I eat, it still hurts. I got headaches, those have also continued since the 13th.  The following week my mouth began to hurt, I started coughing more than normal. First a dry cough, now I&#39;m coughing up phlegm with specks of blood. And I can not stop itching, and I&#39;m getting tired of taking benadryl for it. I contacted my doctor, all I got was these are normal reactions to the vaccine. They last 2 to 4 weeks. I already get migraines, my gut is picky since that shot. I used to eat hot peppers, now if I use pepper on my dinner my stomach is in pain. These side effects should be gone by now. I am one pissed off person.

The following day I began seeing swelling, redness, itching and burning of extremities (mainly the hands, but also feet, ears, face). These symptoms seem to be triggered by the slightest exertions, but have also exhibited without physical activity. These appear to be getting more prevalent each day.

It was a base ball size area on my left arm on my elbow. I saw the doctor who said it was a vaccine reaction. I was given a steroid shot and some antibiotics.  After a week it is much better with only a slight color variation.

                                                The injection itself was incredibly painful.  The nurse giving the injection asked why they were given extra long needles and then asked if I&#39;d like to see it.  I said, &#34;Yes.&#34;  I joked and said it looked like it was more likely for the ass than the arm.  She laughed and proceeded to inject me.  The injection was the most painful I had ever felt.  The next morning, I awoke with pain in my shoulder, neck and back.  Though I expected some reaction to the vaccine, I didn&#39;t expect the amount of pain and discomfort I experienced.  It has continued in large part to the present.  I sought medical advice towards the end of the first week.  Eventually, I received an MRI which suggested myelitis/discitis.  Of course, the MRI was more detailed.    I was subsequently hospitalized for four days where I had numerous blood cultures and another MRI (cervical and thoracic w/and without contract).  The MRI essentially had the same findings.  The doctors are stymied by my history and symptoms.  However,  given the temporal proximity between the time of the injection and the onset of my pain/symptoms (that has yet to resolve), I think it important to report this matter.  I am still is pain and my issues have not resolved.

The younger girl put a band-aide on it, and walked off and called another girl.  The other girl took over the band-aide and it was saturated with blood but stopped bleeding, but area was swollen.  They then had him wait 30 minutes, and everything was fine, and instructed to put ice on it which he did.  The pain seems to have not gone away yet and it&#39;s been over 30 minutes.  At night he feels it more as he relaxes, it&#39;s the same pain as it was when he got the vaccine and he can also feel a little knot if he rubs it.  He called employee health and they offered to do an US and gave him our information to call.    This pain goes all the way past his elbow on the left side only.  Sometimes he can feel it on his back, but it&#39;s mainly on the shoulder area.

Sometimes I was unable to sleep and over the two weeks took 2 or 3 Advil per night to get to sleep. After about two weeks the pain receded and has gone and stayed away. But no surface indications on skin, no restrictions in range of motion...just persistent, deep, ache.  I have subsequently spoken with a friend who also took the J&amp;J shot and reports the SAME symptoms.

                                                Patient developed a rash on left hand a few minutes after receiving vaccine. Rash got better before he left but it was still there. I advised him to wait at least another 20 minutes to make sure he doesn&#39;t have any other severe reactions. He said he felt okay and left after about a total of 35 mins. I advised him to take benadryl when he got home and to contact his doctor if he felt worse. I left a message with his doctor about the incident. I also advised him to use v-safe to report the symptoms.

                                                Patient received his J&amp;J vaccine for COVID-19 on 03/10/2021.  On 3/17, he was at the grocery store when he felt a sting on his left lateral ankle. When he pulled up his pant leg, he saw the small little red spots that were exquisitely tender. He went immediately to his primary care physician&#39;s office, where he was prescribed Bactrim for suspected cellulitis. The rash steadily worsened with extension up his left leg and onto his right leg and blistering of some of the lesions most markedly in his groin. Pain associated with the rash increased and remained most severe on the lateral aspect of the left ankle. He presented back to his primary care physician&#39;s office on 3/19, where he was given methylprednisolone 80 milligrams IV, discharged with a prescription for prednisone 60 milligrams daily for the next few days. Pain worsened the morning of 3/20/21 to the point that he was unable to bear much weight on the left leg prompting his presentation to the emergency department.

                                                Pain in lower left bicep in first week, experiencing fatigue/tiredness. After 10 days I experienced severe pain at the site of injection, very small red spot appeared around injection site. Pain was so severe, I took one capsule hydrocodone 5-325 TB at 2 AM. The medication did not cure the pain, and I slept less than two hours. I called my nurse practitioner&#39;s office, and they offered an appoint late in the morning. And I couldn&#39;t wait that long so I drove to urgent care. Prompt care examined and saw no swelling, ruling out possible blood clot. Prompt care did not have ultra sound. They told me to use ice, heat, and pain medication. Extreme pain continued for about three more days, pain medication did very little to help. Unable to speak directly to the Nurse Practitioner on the phone, due to my disability and alexia, communicating online is very difficult without an assistant present. The pain slowly subsided over the next week.

                                                On Friday, March 12, 2021, at the pharmacy I had an 8:00 am appointment to receive the Johnson &amp; Johnson?s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. I received my vaccine in the left arm but the injection seemed to me (and my wife) to be in an odd location, which was very high up on the shoulder near the shoulder joint. Things seemed fine until Saturday evening when I started to feel some tightness in my left trapezius between my scapula and my occipital bone. By Sunday morning that same area was very tight and painful; what we used call a ?crick.? Sunday afternoon I began to feel some sharp pain in my left shoulder joint. I had very little sleep on Sunday night and by Monday morning I had significant pain in what felt like my humerus.  I made an appointment with a chiropractor  for Monday afternoon and he suggested the vaccine shot might have started an inflammation that led to the tight trapezius, which in turn was causing the cervical spinal nerves to react, thus causing the pain in my arm. At this point I was in a lot of pain and the pain was moving further down toward my elbow. The chiropractor did his usual things and told me to put ice on it and take OCT Ibuprofen and or Naproxen. I was a bit better on Tuesday and decided to attend a three-day pastors? retreat. By Tuesday afternoon the pain had expanded to just below my elbow. I consulted with a doctor friend and he thought it was likely that I was having a reaction to the vaccine and that it would pass. He as concerned to hear of the odd location of my injection. I had another sleepless night and on Wednesday I noticed that the ends of my left thumb and index finder were numb and by that night the numbness had expanded to include most of my index finder. The other arm and shoulder pain continued but varied in intensity. On Wednesday morning I called my wife and asked her to come get me at the retreat and that afternoon I called my doctor&#39;s office office and made an appointment for Thursday morning (3-18-21). I&#39;m  feeling the cumulative effects of the pain and fatigue. My overall pain level is a little less but still present, as is the numbness in my index finger and thumb. My doctor suggested the nerve inflammation was a reaction tot he vaccine.

                                                Approx 10 minutes after injection, pt reported his lower checks were starting to itch and he felt a little swelling in his check bones. Pt also stated he wasn&#39;t having any trouble breaking, skin tone look normal, pt was able to communicate with no problems. He stated the symptoms he was experiencing were something he was used to. It happens to him when he eats chicken  and certain kinds of foods (especially seafood/shellfish). I offered him benadryl and an ice pack while he was here. He refused the ice pack, but did  agree to low dose of benadryl. He took one Allergy Relief 25mg softgel and then continued to set for a little over 30 minutes total before he said he was fine and left with his wife.  I contacted him around 11:50am, he was doing fine and enjoying a good lunch.

On March 30, I work up with a rash on my right leg. After about 2 days the rash appeared on both legs. As of April 9, 2021 the rash has not cleared completely! I have photos which I will try to attach to this report.

My index finger on  my left hand was numb and black and blue all around the knuckle area and into my hand area. I went to my primary care - I went to the acute center there. She said the hand was cold and could see the black and blue. They put me on Plavix for 30 days and I haven&#39;t had any reoccurrence of that. I think it was the 21st, I couldn&#39;t sleep all night, I had a kidney stone - the pain was so bad I got nauseous - around my back and side and in my front. I didn&#39;t have a fever. I went to the doctor office and they checked urine - and said there was blood in the urine. I was prescribed - Tamsulosin HCL. They thought I had passed most of it by the time I got there.

                                                It started with a familiar reaction and that was I had tingling and pain in my feet it started with both feet and it was significant, like when the feet goes to sleep and it is coming back and you feel the pins and needles feeling, and it was exactly what I get with CIDP. It moved from both feet up to both hands and I was not really afraid because that is what happens with CIDP when your auto immune system is stimulated. I get numbness on my feet and in my hands. I thought that the vaccine stimulated my immune system. The CIDP has been in remission and maybe the shot has stimulated my nervous system.  The other day I noticed that when taking the hot plate from the microwave it was hot but I did not feel it at all. I thought the food has not heated up, when my wife touched the plate she said it was very hot and I did not feel the plate hot at all. I also felt pain in my left foot to a point that I am not ambulatory. The pain is so extreme in my left foot if I try to stand up. I have been in my bed for the last 2 days. I am not sure if it is the CIDP or GOUT that is attacking my foot but it has been triggered by the vaccine. I also have severe pain in my left leg. I called my cardiologist and I have a phone consultation with him today to check for clot formation. The pain has subsided a bit today, but yesterday the pain in my leg was very intense. I also had pain at the injection site and felt a little feverish since yesterday around 3PM and it went to 101F and this morning I am fine again. I did not take anything for it and this morning I woke up and I felt well (in regards to the fever). I did not have fever before then.
