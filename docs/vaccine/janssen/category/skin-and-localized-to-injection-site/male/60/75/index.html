Patient reported to emergency department around 10 pm that day (4/9)- says tongue began swelling since 7pm, he took a benadryl at 8pm with no improvement. Per ED physician, patient had &#34;tremendous amount of tongue swelling, I am not even able to visualize the palate he has fullness to his left neck as well&#34;. Patient intubated in emergency room to protect airway.  Patient admitted to ICU where he is still today (4/13). Per chart, the edema subsided on 4/12 and patient was extubated today (4/13). Patient received IV steroids from 4/9- 4/13 (discontinued this morning).  Of note: patient does take lisinopril 20mg daily (start date July 2020). There is concern the angioedema was caused by this medication. Patient received tranexamic acid and Berinert in the emergency department to assist in treating this potential etiology.

                                                Onset of a feeling like I was drunk the afternoon of the vaccine.  The evening on 3/9 sleeping was difficult and I was very restless. When I awoke the next day (3/10) the only symptom was pain at the injection site. The afternoon of the 10th I began to experience flu like symptoms and was lethargic. No fever but did have chills. Slight headache. Awake the morning of 3/11 and symptoms had subsided.

That said, i&#39;ve never had an allergic reaction to anything and have not changed anything in my diet or hygiene habits.  Beginning yesterday around 5 pm, both of my arms became splotchy and itchy.  As the evening progressed, the rash was all over my body.  The &#34;splotchiness&#34; eased after a few hours, but I remained &#34;itchy&#34; throughout the night.  This morning it&#39;s better, but I&#39;m still slightly &#34;itchy&#34; in my extremities, particularly around my ankles and hands.  I have not contacted a Dr, as it appears to be getting significantly better on its own.   Just thought I would let you know in case it&#39;s something that others are experiencing.

                                                Pain at the injection site, chills, low-grade fever (100.1 was the highest recorded), body aches, extreme fatigue.  All symptoms lasted approximately 60-72 hours then felt completely back to normal.  Onset of symptoms was 10 hours after receiving the vaccine.

                                                The injection itself was high on my arm and was very painful as it was administered (much more so than a typical vaccination in the arm).  The pain has been persistent, and has gotten worse over time.  No fever, no inflammation at the injection site other than a red dot that resolved over about one week.  On advice of my physician (nurse practitioner) I&#39;ve been icing the shoulder three times a day and taking ibuprofen 800 mg q 6h - this has not led to any improvement - to the contrary the pain is getting worse and the shoulder is losing substantial mobility.    Something seems to have been done wrong - and am wondering if the injection itself was given in the shoulder or tendon rather than intramuscularly.

                                                Day 1: 11 hours after injection - severe fatigue, dizziness, diminished ability to mentally focus, severe weakness in legs and diminished ability to control legs. Legs intermittently felt numb and at time with &#34;pins and needles&#34; tingling. Knee joints felt as if in danger of flexing backwards. Arms were similarly affected but not as drastically as legs. Arms had better function and control than legs but with marked weakness.  Day 2: Some improvement. Able to go to work but still have fatigue and leg weakness persist. It takes additional mental and physical effort to walk. Walking does not feel automatic or safe like it was before. Still have high level of fatigue. Symptoms improve  some later in the afternoon.

Narrative from family below:  &#34;Day 1 (The day he took the vaccine): My father was complaining of very heavy chest pressure (said he felt like his chest was being pushed down with force.) He felt really tired and had a nasty headache.   Day 2 He began to feel tingles in his legs and arms. Said he felt sore and had mild pain around his back, feet, legs, hands, and arms. The headache came in and out.   Day 3 He began feeling more severe pains in both legs &#43; headache. More tingling around his face, lips, and jaw.  Day 4 Severe pain continued around his entire body. Had an episode where he lost vision from 1 eye (he described it as blurry vision) felt like he was going blind from one eye.  Day 5 Could barely stand on his two feet and could no longer go to work. He stayed in bed and then hospital visits began. My mom took him to emergency for the first time.  I was able to get details of the location where he was vaccinated and onsite contact information. The info is below:

I advised him to wait at least another 20 minutes to make sure he doesn&#39;t have any other severe reactions. He said he felt okay and left after about a total of 35 mins. I advised him to take benadryl when he got home and to contact his doctor if he felt worse. I left a message with his doctor about the incident. I also advised him to use v-safe to report the symptoms.

                                                On Friday, March 12, 2021, at the pharmacy I had an 8:00 am appointment to receive the Johnson &amp; Johnson?s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. I received my vaccine in the left arm but the injection seemed to me (and my wife) to be in an odd location, which was very high up on the shoulder near the shoulder joint. Things seemed fine until Saturday evening when I started to feel some tightness in my left trapezius between my scapula and my occipital bone. By Sunday morning that same area was very tight and painful; what we used call a ?crick.? Sunday afternoon I began to feel some sharp pain in my left shoulder joint. I had very little sleep on Sunday night and by Monday morning I had significant pain in what felt like my humerus.  I made an appointment with a chiropractor  for Monday afternoon and he suggested the vaccine shot might have started an inflammation that led to the tight trapezius, which in turn was causing the cervical spinal nerves to react, thus causing the pain in my arm. At this point I was in a lot of pain and the pain was moving further down toward my elbow. The chiropractor did his usual things and told me to put ice on it and take OCT Ibuprofen and or Naproxen. I was a bit better on Tuesday and decided to attend a three-day pastors? retreat. By Tuesday afternoon the pain had expanded to just below my elbow. I consulted with a doctor friend and he thought it was likely that I was having a reaction to the vaccine and that it would pass. He as concerned to hear of the odd location of my injection. I had another sleepless night and on Wednesday I noticed that the ends of my left thumb and index finder were numb and by that night the numbness had expanded to include most of my index finder. The other arm and shoulder pain continued but varied in intensity. On Wednesday morning I called my wife and asked her to come get me at the retreat and that afternoon I called my doctor&#39;s office office and made an appointment for Thursday morning (3-18-21). I&#39;m  feeling the cumulative effects of the pain and fatigue. My overall pain level is a little less but still present, as is the numbness in my index finger and thumb. My doctor suggested the nerve inflammation was a reaction tot he vaccine.

Several are angry looking. Generally not itchy. On legs, torso &amp; arms. Approximately 2 dozen blotches. I am now on day 3 post inoculation and the blotches have not faded. No difficulty breathing.  Vaccine was administered by Pharmacist.

I contacted him around 11:50am, he was doing fine and enjoying a good lunch.
