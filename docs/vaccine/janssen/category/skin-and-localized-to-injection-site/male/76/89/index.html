                                                Patient states on Friday, 4/9, he went to the pharmacy to receive his J&amp;J Covid-19 vaccine. He states on Saturday morning, his R nostril began to bleed, and continued to bleed until Monday. He states on Wednesday, 4/7, he noticed oral sores that at first were not painful, but large. He was worried about it interfering with his shot, but because he had waited so long to get it, he decided to proceed anyway. He denies any fever or chills, no frank diarrhea, but occasional loose stools, without blood seen. He denies HA, vision changes, or focal neuro deficits. On Sunday, 4/11, the patient ended up going to ED to evaluate his epistaxis, the MD attributed it to his elevated BP, the patient reports it being 160s/90s. They gave him new BP medications, which he took, but when he saw the Dr., he instructed the patient not to keep taking his BP meds. When asking the patient if anything correlates with foods he eats, the only thing he can pinpoint it to, would be pico de gallo. He states it has irritated his mouth before. He also reports recently taking his wife&#39;s supplement (unknown name) but thinks it is for cholesterol. He took that approximately 1 week ago. No new changes in food habits, mouthwash, or toothpaste. He states once his sores began to get a little painful, he went to buy a special mouthwash for oral sores (unsure name). His only reported allergy is to Lisinopril, which his reaction was a whole body rash.    He states they did not pack his nose or do anything for his epistaxis at the ER, but eventually he let the nostril clot with blood. Now he feels fullness in the nare, but does not want to disturb the clot in fear that it will re-bleed. His wife also noticed a petechial rash that began on his BLE, he is unsure when that started.    He presented to  ED on 4/13, due to his PCP  instructing him to be evaluated when he had outpatient labs done and revealed a PLT count of 4,000. In the ED, the patient had normal vital signs.  He was transfused one unit of PLTs. He also had a negative head CT. He was also started on decadron 40mg PO daily by heme/onc. Patient tells me today his sores are less painful and feel smaller than usual. Heme/onc also ordered 2 IVIG 1,000 mg/kg/day x2 doses.

                                                One month after the vaccine I started to get Hot Flashes followed by pain. The pain lasted for six hours and then went away. The pain is all over my body The process returned after a week or so and it has continued intermittently since then. The cycle is always the same. I get a hot flash and then the pain starts. As time goes on it is happening more often and the pain lasts for longer. I get really hot and sweat for about 15 minutes and then the pain starts. It builds up to being a more severe pain which has been lasting up to 24 hours. It has been getting less often and for slightly shorter periods of pain. Just in the last two weeks I started to get pain at the injection site, and it is starting to affect my whole arm around the area. It is like a muscle pain. I have consulted my doctor and She prescribed Tramadol. It seems to help but over the counter medications don&#39;t seem to work.

                                                Symtoms were first noticed on Tuesday June 8th about two oclock in the afternoon when I noticed a slight burning sensation on my right shoulder. I had presumed this to be sunburn. The next day I noticed a few blisters and additional discomfort and subsequently applied OTC lotion. As the days progressed it looked as though it was poison-ivy as opposed to sunburn. Again applied OTC medications to relieve the pain. By Monday, June 14th, the situation had progressed in severity, necessitating a visit to the emergency room. I was examened by DR. who diagnoeded the problem as &#39;shingles&#39;, not poison-ivy. He subsequetly dianosed taking ValACYclovir for seven-days then recommended that I follow-up with a Primary Care Provider in seven-days. The valACHclovir helped stop the spread of the problem, but did&#39;t do much to relieve the discomfort. The following Tuesday, June 22nd I met with Dr. of the Health Clinic adjacent to the hospital. After vitals were all taken, we had a question and answer session where it was determined that nothing else could be done for Me except for the shingles to &#39;run their course&#39;. Retuning home I continued to administer OTC lotions and sprays to help reduce some of the burning sensations experienced around the face, ear, neck, and shoulder which was becoming more severe. After several days of not being able to sleep or get any relief from the &#39;burning and stinging&#39;, I decided it was necessary to get a second opinion. I then notified another hospital, that I would be arriving for an examination that afternoon, July 12th. at approximately 2pm. Upon arrival and completion of completion of all vital signs by medical staff, I was met with a doctor. Upon examination and understanding the symptoms experienced, she prescribed &#39;Gabapentin&#39; to help reduce the &#39;burning sensations&#39; and &#39;Prednisone&#39; to help reduce the &#39;skin rash and swelling&#39;. Returning home and starting the prescribed meds, I did notice some immediate relief from the Gabapentin, which for the first time in more than a week or so, I was able to get a nights sleep. I didn&#39;t notice any changes taking the prednisone and had to presume that it helped stop the spead of the rash from going further.   As I prepare this overview, it is now July 18th and once again experiencing severe pain and tighening of muscles around the face, neck and shoulder. Pain feels like &#39;stinging needles&#39;, &#39;miniture electical shocks&#39; that course thru from above the ear, down thru the face neck and over to the chin-throat&#39; area. Pain lasts but a brief second, but very painfull, making sleep impossible. Touching any area on the right side of my body from the scalp, across the face and neck down to my shoulder, back and collar bone result in extreme &#39;burning sensations&#39;. I have a 12:45 pm appointmet at the hospital on Tuesday July 20th to meet with Dr. who will become my Primary Care Provider. I can only hope that we&#39;re able to come-up with some solution that will easy the severity of the &#39;stinging sensations and burning&#39; that will allow me to sleep and get beck to resuming nornal activity.  Up until this event, I had been an actrive, healthy, 78yo man who had never been sick nor been to a Dr. in over 20 years, which I contribute to the clean, healthy environment here. In summary, it is my firm belief that in view of recent media reports about the Guillian-Barr symtoms which affect the nerves and muscles, it is the result of having received the Johnson&amp;Johnson vaccine that contributed to the onset of my developing shingles. Because I had not had the Shingles vaccine at any time, it might be advisable for those that are beyond a certain age who have not had the shingles vaccine NOT get the Johnson&amp;Johnson vaccine if other alternatives are available.

Pt has been on stable dose of warfarin with INRs in range 90% of the time with only small excursions (0.1-0.2) since 2016. He received Johnson and Johnson vaccine on 4/10 at outside facility, brought in his vaccine card. He states only arm pain and no other side effects from vaccine (although well known to providers here to minimize complaints). He took 4 doses of Advil the day after the vaccine (has taken prn Advil for years while on warfarin). 4/13 came in for INR check, INR was 4.1. He is clinically fine, no bleeding. History and exam did not find any other causes for elevated INR in this otherwise very stable patient.

Then two days later he could not move his left shoulder, and could not move his arm.  If he moves it across his chest feels like somebody is stabbing him.  His lower back is also in a lot of pain, the entire back.   It now feels like a ball rolling from left to right, and sometimes it is both, and then perhaps one or the other. It has also affected his bowel movements as well, watery bowel movements.  He now goes 3-4 times a day.  When he relieves himself the pain subsides    He still continues to have the pain.   He went to his PCP and he gave him OTC medicines that helped some but did not get rid of the pain, especially in his lower back as it felt like somebody was stabbing him, as well as his left arm.   His PCP sent him to pain management and that didn&#39;t work.  He gave him 6 shots into his back, 3 on each side which did not relieve the pain.  He went back to that doctor last week, and has a friend who is in charge of an x-ray company and got an  x-ray.  His lower back didn&#39;t show much of anything.  He went back to pain management and told him to come back and went last week and told him that it could be arthritis and gave him some exercises, stretches, and he couldn&#39;t help him.   He gave him some Tylenol with codeine for the pain, but has not taken them all.     He is improving with his symptoms very slowly and is now able to move some and do exercises which are helping him.  He was almost paralyzed before and now able to move some.  He is waiting for the effects to just leave his body.
