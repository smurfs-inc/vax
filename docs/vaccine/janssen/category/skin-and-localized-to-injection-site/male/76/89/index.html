                                                Patient states on Friday, 4/9, he went to the pharmacy to receive his J&amp;J Covid-19 vaccine. He states on Saturday morning, his R nostril began to bleed, and continued to bleed until Monday. He states on Wednesday, 4/7, he noticed oral sores that at first were not painful, but large. He was worried about it interfering with his shot, but because he had waited so long to get it, he decided to proceed anyway. He denies any fever or chills, no frank diarrhea, but occasional loose stools, without blood seen. He denies HA, vision changes, or focal neuro deficits. On Sunday, 4/11, the patient ended up going to ED to evaluate his epistaxis, the MD attributed it to his elevated BP, the patient reports it being 160s/90s. They gave him new BP medications, which he took, but when he saw the Dr., he instructed the patient not to keep taking his BP meds. When asking the patient if anything correlates with foods he eats, the only thing he can pinpoint it to, would be pico de gallo. He states it has irritated his mouth before. He also reports recently taking his wife&#39;s supplement (unknown name) but thinks it is for cholesterol. He took that approximately 1 week ago. No new changes in food habits, mouthwash, or toothpaste. He states once his sores began to get a little painful, he went to buy a special mouthwash for oral sores (unsure name). His only reported allergy is to Lisinopril, which his reaction was a whole body rash.    He states they did not pack his nose or do anything for his epistaxis at the ER, but eventually he let the nostril clot with blood. Now he feels fullness in the nare, but does not want to disturb the clot in fear that it will re-bleed. His wife also noticed a petechial rash that began on his BLE, he is unsure when that started.    He presented to  ED on 4/13, due to his PCP  instructing him to be evaluated when he had outpatient labs done and revealed a PLT count of 4,000. In the ED, the patient had normal vital signs.  He was transfused one unit of PLTs. He also had a negative head CT. He was also started on decadron 40mg PO daily by heme/onc. Patient tells me today his sores are less painful and feel smaller than usual. Heme/onc also ordered 2 IVIG 1,000 mg/kg/day x2 doses.

Of note, patient has a hx of PE (1995) and afib, and is not on a blood thinner per cardiologist. Patient presented to ED on 4/8/2021 and u/s r/u DVT. Patient contacted physician&#39;s office on 4/19/2021 with continuation of symptoms. Unsure if this is truly an ADE as patient reports the pain/swelling/redness occurred during a walk.

Pt has been on stable dose of warfarin with INRs in range 90% of the time with only small excursions (0.1-0.2) since 2016. He received Johnson and Johnson vaccine on 4/10 at outside facility, brought in his vaccine card. He states only arm pain and no other side effects from vaccine (although well known to providers here to minimize complaints). He took 4 doses of Advil the day after the vaccine (has taken prn Advil for years while on warfarin). 4/13 came in for INR check, INR was 4.1. He is clinically fine, no bleeding. History and exam did not find any other causes for elevated INR in this otherwise very stable patient.

Numbness continues to come back every few days and lasts 1 to 2 hours (worse in thumbs, mostly the left).  No purpleness.  Patient called his MD the day after the shot.  MD told him to soak in a warm bath, which he said did help some.

                                                As soon as I started to inject vaccine into arm patient arm started to swell and get a welt at injection sight. I finished injecting vaccine but by the time I finished the welt was about 1.5 inches in diameter and about a 1/4 inch thick. Notified provider and he looked at it and stated it was a local reaction and stated to patient to watch it and put ice on it when he got home. He also told patient if he had any other side effects to come in to clinic or go to ER.
