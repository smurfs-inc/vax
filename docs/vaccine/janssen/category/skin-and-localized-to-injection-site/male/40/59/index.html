He did bleed a little and after putting on the bandaid, I went to grab an ice pack and I started applying the icepack to the site. Checked on patient every 5 minutes. Even did a follow up call to him an hour later and he told me he was doing okay. No more warmth in the area, some pain but the swelling had gone down substantially. I suggested to continue to monitor, apply icepack

                                                Experienced moderate debilitating flu symptoms day after vaccination and recovered the following day.  Over one week later (3/25) developed skin sensitivity on the neck which later spread to back, torso, and legs.  Skin sensitivity persists still one week after onset, is a severe chafing feeling when skin comes into contact with clothing.  No rash or any visual signs.  Along with the skin sensitivity, mild to moderate chills from day to day as well as muscle fatigue and upper/lower back pain.  Symptoms varied in severity day to day; used ibuprofen and it seemed to offer limited, temporary relief.  Concurrent with second onset of symptoms, noticed gradual abdominal inflammation and developed sensation similar to UTI but urine dip and lab test results were all normal.  Doctor concluded immune reaction to vaccine as no other allergies or changes in routine as well as no prior medical history of any of these symptoms. Prescribed daily prednisone for three days to calm immune response; after one day symptoms were greatly improved.  Abdominal inflammation has improved and UTI sensation improved.  Still experiencing slight chills and skin sensitivity unchanged.

                                                Started with itch on left inner thigh that turned in several raised bumps that resembled hives. After about an hour, it went away. Several hours later, I started having the same reaction on the sides of my torso, under my arms to my waist line. I had a virtual doctor visit that evening where the doctor prescribed Prednisone 20mg for 5 days and Benadryl. Saturday, April 3rd, took second dose of Prednisone and continued Benadryl every 4 hours. Symptoms were better in the late morning and early afternoon then started getting worse. Started getting the hives on my arms, legs, and started spreading to my neck, back of my scalp, and onto my face. It got worse at the night progressed and I went to a 24 hours urgent care at 2am on Sunday, April 4th. The doctor checked me out and noting the severe case, increased my prescription to 60mg Prednisone, decreasing 10mg every day, and Famotidine 20mg daily, Clairitin in the morning, and Benadryl at night. Taking the 60mg of Prednisone on April 4th has drastically reduced the symptoms. I will continue the regime to determine if the issue goes away completely.

                                                The next day I noticed tinnitus (high pitch mild ringing in both ears) .  Therefore it has been a total of 7 days with ringing in both ears and it has not gone away.  It has been constant, no pulses, no frequency changes, etc.  Just constant high pitch ringing in both ears. Sometimes by inner ear feels funny, slightly tingle feeling that is related to the tinnitus.  The tinnitus is most noticeable in quiet settings, sleeping, reading, watching TV, I do not noticed it as much in office environments, listening to music, walking outside.  I have experienced tinnitus in the past after loud music band or rock concert but do not attend live loud music often and try to avoid it because it hurts my ears.  I do not have any known hearing problem, I try to protect my ears and use hearing protection often to avoid damage. When I cut my lawn I wear hearing protection, when I am working on shop floor I wear hearing protection.  I am thinking the vaccine is related somehow. I never had COVID-19 in past.  I use to be able to be in quiet settings and not have any tinnitus before vaccine.

                                                Had a sudden onset fever which reached 103 the evening of the injection.  There was muscle soreness, fatigue, my pulse was above 80 all night and reached 100 during the peak of the fever.  By the next morning, the fever had dropped to 100, fatigue remained and a slight headache appeared.  The headache was gone by noon, the fatigue remained all day.  The evening after the injection, a slight fever returned and then stopped.  Two days after the injection, there were no further averse reactions other than slight soreness in the injection site.  I am no longer fatigued and feel fine.  Hope this information helps.

The next  day the rash had mostly cleared but still a little itchy. Today the 22 I have had a really bad headache.

At 15 minutes asked nurse if normal. Then started sweating. left hand turned purple. Dont really remember anything else. Went unconscious. Remember them yelling Code something and Cardiac arrest. Taken to ER. Think they may have said anaphalatic shock. I think they gave me epinepherine. Had paralysis in left hand when i woke up for a few minutes. Blood work and EKG were normal. Went home within a couple of hours. Light-headed two days later still. Saw doctor two days after. Blood pressure is high.  Little bit of fatigue and brain fog.

                                                I received the J&amp;J shot after work on Friday around 5:30 p.m.. Around 3 a.m. Saturday morning, I woke up with a fever and chills. My head was hot. My body was cold. I had a pretty severe headache as well.  My body ached all over. Muscle and joint pain. I took Tylenol, but it didn&#39;t seem to do much. I spent all day Saturday in bed or on the couch. I ran a fever of 100.9 to 101.6 all day Saturday. My body ached making it hard to go up or down stairs. I was weak feeling and I was exhausted just going to refrigerator to get juice or water. Not much of an appetite all day. Also, arm was sore and bruised at the shot location. That was the least of my issues. Today is Sunday and I am feeling better now. I feel like the worst is absolutely behind me, but I felt so terrible yesterday, I thought I should report my issues.

Most importantly pain in the spine from middle to lower back..  (Thursday 0510 hrs) while brushing teeth, a sharp pain put me to my knees..  1200 hrs pain was still there... Went to urgent care.. Doctor said it was back spasms.. Said he didn&#39;t know if it was related to the vaccine. Then also said nobody knows.  I have not worked out nor have I lifted anything heavy in 2 weeks prior to receiving the covid vaccine.

I also ached all over. I took 2 Tylenol and was able to fall back asleep. I woke up sweaty, but the chills and fever were gone. I?m now just stiff, with some mild pain at the injection site.

                                                About 20 hours after injection, I had mild flu-like symptoms, including headache and muscle ache, lasting about 12 hours. But about 5 days after my injection (5 days &#43; 5 hours, actually), I experienced a bewildering all-over rash that freaked me out. It started as itching around my elbows and ankles -- it felt like mosquito bites and sunburn together -- and spread to wrist and knee areas. The rash climbed by legs and arms. I applied coat after coat of Benadryl, which seemed to help. The rash would disappear and move somewhere else. I had it on my left foot, but then that resolved, only to find it on my right foot. After about 3 hours, it had spread to my stomach, the bridge of my nose, and my cheeks. It started to calm down around midnight. I woke up at 6:00 am (12 hours after onset) with extremely itchy hands. At 8:00 am (14 hours after onset), it had mostly disappeared except for patches on my back, and my wrists still itch. I&#39;m hoping it goes away later today! It was crazy!

Soreness lasted approximately two days.

                                                First, pain around the injection site; it appeared within a few hours after the injection, but it was bearable.  Then, after about 23 hours after the injection, bad headache (especially around the eyes - which also caused light sensitivity) and general malaise. Shortly thereafter, low-grade fever (99.5 F) and significant muscle pain, all over the body.  The most worrisome side effect was the last one, which appeared during the second night after the injection (about 32-33 hours after the injection): extremely fast heartbeat / racing heart.   I did not use any treatments for these side effects.

This lasted for several hours after... At 11:30pm, almost 7 hours after the shot, I started to feel lousy. I started to get body aches and chills. Within 30 minutes they were fairly intense body aches and chills, shaking. At 1:00am I started to feel nauseas . At 1:30 am I started dry heaving. At approximately 2:30 I threw up twice, and the dry heaving and nausea lasting until 4am , when I took an anti nausea pill. I finally fell asleep at 430am. I woke up at 8am and felt tired, and no longer nauseated.

After use of benadryl the hives became more red, less raised, and resembled a confluent measles rash. From association with hives I experienced ear pruritus, sore throat, nausea. And fatigue. Hydrocortisone creme was used on the rash.

                                                I received the J&amp;J vaccine on 3/24, and by that evening I had a headache, and my tinnitus was louder than normal. I had mild barely perceptible tinnitus prior to the vaccine. I would normally never notice it during the day, but lying down and going to sleep in a quiet room I would hear it. Constant high pitch but not loud, in the background more. I always run a fan in my bedroom so that I have some white noise and don&#39;t hear it. I had the flu like headache from the vaccine for two days and then it slowly started to subside into the weekend. I was tired as well from the immune response.  Five days out, I get out of the shower in the morning, and go to put underarm deodorant on, and notice my left armpit is all bright red. I check my right armpit, just as red.. Took photos of the red armpits and shared with some family and friends, as I read on the Internet that there were all kinds of crazy side effects that were possible. The red skin like rash is one of them, although my armpits never itched or burned. I could feel that they were warmer than normal, that was it. It was the 2nd day after my red armpits that my tinnitus ratcheted up to the current level that I am really unhappy with. The red armpits went away within 48 hours, never did anything about the redness, just didn&#39;t put underarm deodorant on until it passed. Sadly, the Tinnitus has remained and it is at a level that is distracting and persistent.

                                                Patient had arm tingling shortly after injection. Pt stayed in store for about 4 hours after 2pm injection, no redness or swelling noticed. Pt was quite anxious &amp; nervous (but already has severe anxiety). Pharmacist called patient following afternoon, the 11th and patient noted he was doing marginally better but still sounded anxious. Pharmacist called patient on Fri the 12th 5:16p and this was when the patient explained the following: Muscle stiffness on left side &amp; pain down left leg; cranial pain; shoulder stiffness; nasal congestion; some shortness of breath; soreness &amp; fatigue.  Patient called back and said he had partial shortness of breath at 7:34p on the 12th.  On Sat the 13th at 11am, pharmacist called to check on pt; found him quite agitated &amp; saying, &#34;He feels the shot was botched&#34;, noted he had called Janssen to report his issues.

                                                Initial symptoms began with pain at the injection site and generalized fatigue.  This developed into soft tissue pain in proximity of the large and small joints which could be elicited further on palpation.  I had eye pain (left more severe than the right) which could be further elicited on palpation, headache, dizziness, chills, and an inability to feel warm.  There was also significant skin sensitivity over the trunk, scalp, and upper extremities and more in the left arm than the right.  The symptoms persisted over the second day albeit at less severity.  Presently on the third day, I am experiencing continued eye pain, mainly in the left eye and mild dizziness.

                                                After getting the shot on Friday at 6:00 pm. I did not have any issues with the shoulder.   Sunday evening around 11pm I have started to have shoulder pain.  The pain is around the area of the injection.  The pain  is generally in the deltoid muscle  and has spread some to the bicep muscle as well.   Uncertain if this is common to the injection process but it caused concern as its onset had been  over 48 hours post injection.

I slept most of the rest of the day and night and felt better when I woke up Thursday morning, well enough to go about a normal day.  It is now late Thursday afternoon and I am still a little tired and mildly achy with no fever but otherwise much improved.    One other thing to report, initially there was no pain or tenderness to the injection site but that started changing about 24 hours after the injection.  Now about 46 hours after injection the site has a constant noticeable soreness even if I am not moving my arm.

                                                I had a rash develop I might lower extremities from just below the knees to mid thigh. It happened around 4 p.m. I did not know if it was something that I had come in contact with outside so I took a shower and applied cortisone cream to the rash. Around 6 p.m. I developed a rash on the left side of my chest the rash continue to grow across my chest and my abdomen to both sides and my arms.   Again applied cortisone cream. Around 9 p.m. I took antihistamines and went to bed in the morning the rash is gone. I&#39;m only reporting this because I&#39;ve only read where the rash is on the arm or the injection site where this one was on my lower extremities and my upper extremities chest an abdomen.

                                                Around 7:00 P.M. on March 12, 2021 approximately 9 hours after receiving the Jansen COVD-19 vaccine in my left arm. I developed extreme fatigue, muscle aches, skin hurt to the touch of anything including clothing, headache, and fever 101.5.  I had to go to bed and was very weak.  I took ibuprofen and Tylenol for the discomfort.  I slept 14 hours and was able to get up at 11:00 A.M. on March 13, 2021.  The soreness at the site of the injection is not problematic.  There were other odd symptoms overnight I would awake with strange nerve like sensations tingling and itching that occurred on the bottom of the left foot, upper lip, and neck.  I also had several episodes of restlessness that was so bad that I had to stand for a few minutes before being able to lay down again.  The worst is the skin hurting and headache.  I have also had a few dizzy episodes since getting out of bed this morning.  It passes if I sit down or hold onto something.  None of these symptoms are normal for me and I cannot remember having a reaction to any vaccinations that I have received in the past.  I hope this helps with your study.

I took Tylenol every 4 hours, but did not improve, only brought the fever down a bit.  Today after 24 hours, I still have headache, muscular aches, and fatigue.

Still freezing and body aches. Put on sweatpants and long sleeve t-shirt. Now have A/C off and windows open, 82 degrees outside. My temp taken before I started this form was at 98.7. I ache all over and am freezing. Not shivering though. But have goosebumps on arms under sleeves. I am very uncomfortable. It is now 10:35pm.

                                                About a week after receiving the shot from the hospital, I starting having itching in my elbows then calves and inner thighs and back sides of my knees. It started as blotches in areas. The ones on my arms seemed to have gone away. We have confirmed I am using the same soap, same laundry detergent and same deodorant. It was the worst on 4/4/21. So I have started to bathe in epson salt each day and not only shower. 4/5/21 it was high  on my thighs. Trying to minimize itching. I also tried to apply a 1% hydrocortisone anti itch cream the last last few days. The redness has been reduced today. I have pictures of it growing.  I think getting better.

Starting about 10-14 days after receiving the vaccine (IM into my deltoid), I have been experiencing a regional (almost dermatomal) distribution itchiness and hypersensitivity in my left infrascapular and upper lateral back region. It&#39;s a superficial (dermal/epidermal) discomfort, not deep. I have observed NO associated rash or hives; nothing is visually evident. I am still experiencing this at day 19 post vaccine. I&#39;ve not taken any medication, have not applied any topicals, etc.
