He did bleed a little and after putting on the bandaid, I went to grab an ice pack and I started applying the icepack to the site. Checked on patient every 5 minutes. Even did a follow up call to him an hour later and he told me he was doing okay. No more warmth in the area, some pain but the swelling had gone down substantially. I suggested to continue to monitor, apply icepack

As the day goes by, the pain in the arm has diminished, as well as the hives in the eyes.

                                                Experienced moderate debilitating flu symptoms day after vaccination and recovered the following day.  Over one week later (3/25) developed skin sensitivity on the neck which later spread to back, torso, and legs.  Skin sensitivity persists still one week after onset, is a severe chafing feeling when skin comes into contact with clothing.  No rash or any visual signs.  Along with the skin sensitivity, mild to moderate chills from day to day as well as muscle fatigue and upper/lower back pain.  Symptoms varied in severity day to day; used ibuprofen and it seemed to offer limited, temporary relief.  Concurrent with second onset of symptoms, noticed gradual abdominal inflammation and developed sensation similar to UTI but urine dip and lab test results were all normal.  Doctor concluded immune reaction to vaccine as no other allergies or changes in routine as well as no prior medical history of any of these symptoms. Prescribed daily prednisone for three days to calm immune response; after one day symptoms were greatly improved.  Abdominal inflammation has improved and UTI sensation improved.  Still experiencing slight chills and skin sensitivity unchanged.

                                                Started with itch on left inner thigh that turned in several raised bumps that resembled hives. After about an hour, it went away. Several hours later, I started having the same reaction on the sides of my torso, under my arms to my waist line. I had a virtual doctor visit that evening where the doctor prescribed Prednisone 20mg for 5 days and Benadryl. Saturday, April 3rd, took second dose of Prednisone and continued Benadryl every 4 hours. Symptoms were better in the late morning and early afternoon then started getting worse. Started getting the hives on my arms, legs, and started spreading to my neck, back of my scalp, and onto my face. It got worse at the night progressed and I went to a 24 hours urgent care at 2am on Sunday, April 4th. The doctor checked me out and noting the severe case, increased my prescription to 60mg Prednisone, decreasing 10mg every day, and Famotidine 20mg daily, Clairitin in the morning, and Benadryl at night. Taking the 60mg of Prednisone on April 4th has drastically reduced the symptoms. I will continue the regime to determine if the issue goes away completely.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after the patient received his vaccination, he rested his head on the wall behind him in the chair he was being observed in and passed out and turned white. His wife began slapping his face and screaming his name and the observer called for me. I arrived within seconds and assisted his wife in moving him from the floor to the chair. Within seconds of getting his head to the ground safely, he came back to and was very sweaty, red in the face. He stayed on the ground laying down, and then sitting for approximately 25 minutes. During that time, he told us that he had previously passed out during 3 procedures done at doctors offices.  We got him an ice pack and a orange pop as he was complaining of being hot and having only eaten a granola bar all day. He was able to get up to a chair and sat there for an additional 5 minutes, before he was able to walk out on his own accord. I have spoken with the patient twice since, once last evening and once today and he reports he feels great now besides the expected body aches from the vaccination.

Patient was brought to the ED at Hospital where he was evaluated by me in the ED.  Patient had a normal mental status (GCS 15) and was alert and oriented on exam.  He did have some bruising to his forehead from the airbag.  Patient denies feeling ill or lightheaded after receiving the vaccine and reports the syncopal event came on very suddenly.

                                                Pain in chest and back began on Wednesday 4/14.  What started out feeling like an uncomfortable pulled muscle in my back/chest area on Wednesday escalated rapidly to very sharp stabbing pains in my chest and back by Thursday afternoon 4/15.  After discussing my symptoms with the office of my PCP Thursday afternoon, I was told to go to the Emergency Room for evaluation.  I checked into the ER at approx 6pm that Thursday evening on 4/15.  While there I underwent a blood test, EKG and a chest Xray.  Upon evaluating the results of each test the Dr on assignment stated that there were no problems with major organs but could not diagnose.    Small red marks began developing on the right side of my chest that same day and progressively expanded in quantity across the right side of my chest and back.  A follow-up visit with my PCP was completed on Tuesday 4/20 and the diagnosis of Shingles was confirmed.  Pain has not subsided and has only gotten worse as of 4/21.  Prescription treatments began the evening of 4/20.

                                                The evening of the vaccination I began experiencing tingling at the site of the shot, then this extended through the night to chest pains and tightness in the chest. That continued through the night and into the following day. The following day and  lasting until present (4/27/2021) I have continued to experience tingling at night, extending to my arm and fingers, random very sharp pains in my chest, and some feeling of strong heart throbbing. This subsides during the day-time (when I&#39;m upright versus lying down) but all of these symptoms return during the evening. These are all things I never experienced prior to the vaccine. Also, I have tested regularly for COVID-19 since my companyconducts covid-19 testing and I have not been infected with COVID-19 at any point during the past year. The continuation of these symptoms is concerning. There have been at least two instances where the sharp pains in my chest were much more intense than the other chest pains I have felt since the vaccine.

I woke up the next morning feeling much better with little to no signs of hives

                                                Hives start forming 12 hours after receiving vaccine. When I woke up in the morning my body was covered in hives. I went to e.r. in the night as advised by my doctor. They gave me a oral steroid, a pepcid and some benadryl, also gave me prescriptions. When I woke up the next morning hives had mostly gone away, but returned  later that evening due to not picking up prescription from pharmacy. I have it now and am taking them. I still get itchy and have some burning but it&#39;s very minor and a little more tolerable with the medications.

The next day, the kidney pain turned into a constant ache.  Headache worsened.  Severe joint pain.  Arm/injection site was horribly sore.  By 5:00PM I had a 101.2 fever.  That (Thursday/next night) evening, I felt much better.  Friday morning, I woke up feeling completely normal with only minor pain at injection site.

                                                I had an itchy raised red rash that started between my shoulder blades on my back, and over the course of about 4 hours spread around my ribcage to the center of my chest. Took Pepcid and Zyrtec, which caused rash to abate. It returned very mildly for a few more days then subsided completely.  For reference, the only other time in my life that I ever had any kind of rash was immediately after leaving the hospital in late 2019 after I suffered serious respiratory complications due to an oddly severe non-flu mystery virus that knocked out my sense of taste and smell, made me sick as a dog, and nearly killed me. At the time it was thought that my rash may have been an allergic reaction to the Ceftin I was taking, but given what we know today, I&#39;m not so sure.

Monday morning at approximately 0230 i woke up to what i can only describe as lightning pains in my legs.  It was a very intense pain shooting from my upper thighs to my knees and slightly bending around to the top of my calves on the outside of the leg.  Monday all day i did not feel well.  Had a dull pain in center of chest, and my left arm from the shoulder blade to the elbow had what i can only describe as a slight warm sensation.  I was also very &#34;foggy&#34; and light headed.  On Tuesday the pain in my chest worsened.  My left arm kept going numb (and still does today 04.21.2021), my jaw hurt, i was light headed and again very foggy.  On Wednesday it was the same thing and I called the VA and they told me to come to the ER for evaluation.

The shaking stopped at that time and my temperature went from 101.1 to 102.5. My skin was warm and I began to be very clammy. Around 3:45 AM, the fever broke and I was down to 99.5. I?ve subsequently had muscle aches and the feeling of being fatigued.

                                                My initial symptoms were light swelling a region around the shoulder of my injection arm and excessive sweating in the armpit on my injection arm side.  Following this, symptoms similar to being on a hallucinogenic gradually manifested over the next several hours, including euphoria, a persistent urge to grind teeth, and some mild-to-moderate visual and physical effects.  Following the date of the injection, the primary symptom has been a bruise/cramp hybrid pain in the upper arm of the injection site that is gradually receding (but still ongoing), along with random light bouts of nausea and headaches, random light pains throughout my injection arm, and occurrences of coldness in my injection arm (lasts about an hour)

                                                On 4/10 I started feeling tired with muscle aches.  A few days later my skin started to hurt.  Clothing was uncomfortable when it moved across my skin. Those symptoms lasted about a week. Then as they started to lessen I had some back pain (Sciatic) and a sore throat.  Also the muscles behind my eyes were slightly painful and bright lights were uncomfortable.  Then about  4/21 most of the symptoms reduced and I was feeling close to normal.  Then on 4/22 I was brushing my teeth and noticed that I couldn?t spit water like normal.  I called my GP doc and she recommended I head to the ER.   After thinking about it I also remember on 4/21 while drinking something I had some water squirt out of my lips.  At the time I thought I was just being clumsy but in hindsight the muscle weakness in my face started on 4/20.   I checked into the ER on 4/22.  When I checked into the hospital my facial weakness was very difficult to notice.  By the evening of 4/22 it was noticeable if I tried to ?show my teeth? or make a big smile. By the morning of 4/23 it was very noticeable.  The morning of 4/24 I couldn?t move my lips, nose or eyebrows.  My tongue, jaw and throat were not impacted at all.   I was started on plasmapheresis on  4/24. I had another treatment on 4/25. I noticed facial weakness was very slightly recovering the evening of 4/25.  By 4/27 my facial weakness is still healing with noticeable improvement day to day.

There was muscle soreness, fatigue, my pulse was above 80 all night and reached 100 during the peak of the fever.  By the next morning, the fever had dropped to 100, fatigue remained and a slight headache appeared.  The headache was gone by noon, the fatigue remained all day.  The evening after the injection, a slight fever returned and then stopped.  Two days after the injection, there were no further averse reactions other than slight soreness in the injection site.  I am no longer fatigued and feel fine.  Hope this information helps.

                                                I thought I was going to get the first shot of the Moderna vaccine, it wasn&#39;t until the needle was in my arm that I was told I had received the Janssen vaccine.  At approximately 4:46pm I developed a strong pain at the injection site.  At approximately 8pm I began to run a  fever and feel extremely fatigued.  My back and all my joints started to ache, I was sweating but also freezing cold.  I had a dull, throbbing pain in my testes.  I had pain in my scalp, my eyebrows, my ear lobes, my fingernails, my toes and toenails, the soles of my feet hurt.  Least of all I also had a headache.   I took 500mg Ibuprofen for the pain.    Now, almost 48 hours later I still have a low grade fever, still have considerable pain at the injection site, still have a headache.  The remaining symptoms dissipated on 5/2/21 at about 12pm.  Took another 500mg Ibuprofen for breakfast, but otherwise have had no appetite since receiving the vaccine.

                                                Approximately four weeks after receiving the shot I came down with symptoms related to Shingles and was diagnosed with such five days later.  Unsure if there is causation but I thought it was worth reporting because other than receiving the covid vaccine I have had no changes or health issues or anything else that would indicate a change in my immunity status that could have resulted in this onset.  I am a bit on the young side to be experiencing Shingles so thought it was worth reporting.

Immediately sat back down to place my head between my knees, and completely blacked out, fallout out of the chair and hitting my head and knee on the floor and  nearby fixtures. Regained consciousness on floor about 30 seconds after fainting and immediately felt much better. Pharmacy staff were on hand and promptly called 911, instructed me not to move and took my pulse and monitored me until EMS arrived within 5-10 minutes. Vital signs normal including BP 120/90, 100% o2 levels, normal blood sugar and EKG. EMS assisted in getting me back to seated position and monitored for another 10-15 minutes. Declined transport and had family member drive me home where I rested for a few hours and woke up feeling fine. Very minor bruising / bump on head with no lasting sign of concussion or other trauma. 24&#43; hours post vaccine no other notable vaccine reactions aside from sore arm / muscles on injection site.

Woke up April 7th at 7AM with sharp pains in my left shoulder (same side as shot) and slight shortness of breath, and slight chest pain in the left quadrant of my torso (same side as shot).  Proceeded to take Advil and seemed to help a bit.  Minor aches/pains and shortness of breath throughout the day until about 8PM.  At this time shoulder chest pain became more severe, and breathing became very strained, short, and painful.  Pain and breathing kept getting worse and at midnight on Wednesday night thought I was having a heart attack due to extreme chest pain, couldn&#39;t breath, lightheaded, dizzy, tingly extremities.  My wife drove me to ER at 12:30 AM Thursday.

Then about 5:30pm I got super uncomfortable and then my skin got hypersensitive.   To the point I couldn&#39;t even touch it.  Then I felt like I had a fever but when I checked I did not.  Went to bed at 8pm still with the hypersensitive skin.  Could not get comfortable to sleep but when i eventually fell asleep I slept for 10 hours.  Thats about 5 more than I normally do.  The next day the hypersensitive skin was gone just felt a little wore out.

                                                At injection muscle spasmed, nurse stated never seen that before.  Within 1-2 hours had runny nose and felt stuffed up, thought it could be allergies or something and didn?t really attribute to vaccine.  4-5 hours  after injection felt something across the top of my brain ... felt as though something had been stuck in a blood vessel and became unstuck allowing blood to shoot through.  Was certainly freaked out by this, but was at an event and head of the ER department of the local hospital was also attending - so figured I had quicker access to medical care there if needed, than at home.   30-60 minutes later congestion completely cleared up.  9-12 hours after vaccination had extreme chills.  Day after vaccination had pain below the injection site... injection was 2? above pain.  Also neck pain. Day 2-8 since vaccination, on/off muscle pain or injection site pain. Today, day 9, have muscle pain in wrist of injection arm.

They finally decided it was an allergic reaction. Gave a steroid shot and Benadryl. Sent home on steroids for 5 days. The next day had rash and itching. The next day it was worse looked like lace pattern rash over most of his body and really bad itching. Like this through the 20th then he took Claritin and put on anti -itch cream. The next  day the rash had mostly cleared but still a little itchy. Today the 22 I have had a really bad headache.

                                                Pt. received the vaccine at approximately 2:44pm.  Before I could hand him his card, his hands began trembling and he looked pale.  I asked how he was feeling.  He reported feeling shaky, dizzy, and very hot.  I asked him if he was having any difficulty breathing, had tightness in his throat/airways, or even felt a tingle.  He said no.  Noting the time, I asked if he had eaten lunch.  I asked if he has ever felt this way before.  He said he had when he gets a &#34;hypoglycemic attack.&#34;  While not diabetic nor on any medications, he said he will occasionally get very low blood sugar.  He said he had not eaten since early that morning.  Another employee brought some juice I requested.  I again asked him about symptoms related to anaphylaxis, to which was not an indication of an anaphylactic reaction.  I gave him the juice to sip.  I asked him again about symptoms.  Because he was still dizzy, I took his blood pressure/heart rate.  His BP was 160/119 and heart rate 96bpm.  His color became more gray over the next several minutes.  He was still too dizzy to stand, felt hot, shaky, and now nauseous.  He handed over the juice and was given a receptacle if he vomited.  We suspected a vasovagal response, but was still symptomatic after 10 minutes. Meanwhile, the other pharmacist tried to call his doctor&#39;s office.  We learned his doctor had moved away and he had not yet come in nor selected a new provider.   We asked him if he felt he needed to be seen by a doctor.  He said he did and agreed to us calling an ambulance.   The ambulance arrived around 3:10.  The EMTs took his BP.  It had come down, but he could not stand up without his knees buckling.  The EMTs got him on the stretcher and took him to the hospital.

At 15 minutes asked nurse if normal. Then started sweating. left hand turned purple. Dont really remember anything else. Went unconscious. Remember them yelling Code something and Cardiac arrest. Taken to ER. Think they may have said anaphalatic shock. I think they gave me epinepherine. Had paralysis in left hand when i woke up for a few minutes. Blood work and EKG were normal. Went home within a couple of hours. Light-headed two days later still. Saw doctor two days after. Blood pressure is high.  Little bit of fatigue and brain fog.

My body was cold. I had a pretty severe headache as well.  My body ached all over. Muscle and joint pain. I took Tylenol, but it didn&#39;t seem to do much. I spent all day Saturday in bed or on the couch. I ran a fever of 100.9 to 101.6 all day Saturday. My body ached making it hard to go up or down stairs. I was weak feeling and I was exhausted just going to refrigerator to get juice or water. Not much of an appetite all day. Also, arm was sore and bruised at the shot location. That was the least of my issues. Today is Sunday and I am feeling better now. I feel like the worst is absolutely behind me, but I felt so terrible yesterday, I thought I should report my issues.

This burst and was clearly filled with blood.  Over the ensuing 24 hours, he has had multiple such blisters and came to the Emergency Room for fear of a reaction to the COVID vaccine that he had had 13 days ago.  This was Johnson and Johnson.  He had no major reactions to it.  On coming to the Emergency Room today, he noticed significant petechiae forming over the lower extremities as well as scattered petechiae forming elsewhere.

                                                Patient received the vaccine. Immunizing tech stated: the patient seemed fine at the time of the shot. After administration of the shot the patient began to bleed out of injection site (like normal). The immunizing tech swabbed the area with cotton and placed a Band-Aid on the patient then stepped back into the pharmacy to grab another band aid while the patient remained at the immunization chair. The tech applied another band aid and told the patient to wait 15 minutes after the immunization and directed him to a waiting chair. The tech came back into the pharmacy and was cleaning the immunization basket when the patient&#39;s wife yelled for help. At this point I went out to the patient. Another tech called 911, another grabbed a nearby EpiPen. The immunizing tech grabbed the e-kit while I was out with the patient while he was unresponsive. Patient was unresponsive and slouched in chair. His wife and I supported the neck of the patient and laid him on the floor. I checked pulse and breathing to which both were present. Patient was still unresponsive and making strange movements. Pulse and breathing remained present and then the patient became responsive relatively quickly. At this point patient responsive and answering questions and moving fine. He asked if he had passed out then stated, he had a phobia of needles and said he felt nauseated. (wife previously stated he had a fear of injections). Soon after the ambulance showed up and I told the paramedics the above story. After a few more minutes I checked in with the paramedics and they said the patient was doing fine. Lastly, he was taken out of store with paramedics.

After 15 minutes slight tingling/numbness on the tip of my tongue and slight tingling in the upper lips of my mouth. I was not worried. I took 1 Benadryl and 2 Ibuprofen (400 ml) at that time for symptoms. I took additional 1 Benadryl and 4  Ibuprofen about 6 hours later as a precaution.  Day 2 after about 36 hours I had slight soreness, and some sweating as I slept the 2nd night. Treated with 4 ibuprofen. Also I woke up with a feeling of uneasiness in the middle of the night on the 2nd night.  Day three, just a general feeling of tiredness. Day 4 and 5 still slight ache in the injection sight if pressure is applied. Other than that I feel normal as of day 5.

A week later and muscles are feeling somewhat better. Skin still very sensitive. Still more tired than usual. Still avoiding exercise until muscles feel 100%.

Normal gum soreness for me after a cleaning goes away by the next day when I wake up.    On Sunday 4/18, I was working on the car and bruised my arm/wrist in a couple of places.  That evening the locations bruised up really good and was tender.  Today the areas are still tender and have dark bruising patterns.   I generally do not bruise like this, and frankly was surprised bruises even appeared.   Yes, I did bang my arm on the car a couple of times, but no where hard enough to receive this kind of bruising.  I do not think this is an issue for me -- more of &#34;just dealing with the inconvenience,&#34; but am curious if this is some sort of side effect from the vaccine.  I could not find any information online related to &#34;easily bruises&#34; at all.

                                                My full list of symptoms were:  Pins and needle feeling as well as hypersensitivity all over my skin that originated in my lower legs but traveled up my body to include my entire legs, hips, and arms.  It was more severe on the left side of my body which is the side I received the vaccine. I did not notice it on my head, face, and upper torso.  I had full muscle control but I did have problems with my bladder and bowels.  I&#39;m not sure if I could not control them or did not feel them because the sensitivity was high in my hip area but I could not control them fully.  No treatment was administered except to wait and see.  Three days later and I am improving but not fully recovered yet.

                                                Shingles.  On the evening of the vaccine, he had a low grade fever and chills (from approximately 7 pm to 1 am).  Two days later, he developed shingles.  They started as a red rash spot in the middle of his back, approximately the size of 2 quarters, 2 days after the vaccine.  On the 3rd day, the red rash was apparent along the right side of his midsection.  Blisters started to appear on day 4.   He phoned his doctor and provided photos for a virtual patient visit, and the doctor diagnosed shingles.  The area affected is both itchy and painful.  The doctor prescribed Valocyclovir.   After taking the medication for 3 days, the blisters started to dry out and scab.   The itching and pain are still present but reduced from their peak.

                                                Patient received Johnson&amp;Johnson COVID vaccine in the afternoon on 3/31/21. Patient reported having right arm pain, diaphoresis, chills, nausea, and muscle aches/pain in upper leg/lower back at 5:30am the following morning. Patient took 2 tablets of 500mg naproxen in the morning and in the afternoon. Symptoms did not resolve and patient had to leave work early. Upon getting home patient took 2 tablets of 650mg tylenol and symptoms resolved within 48 hours. On 4/3/21 patient reported mild to severe pain in heel of left foot. The following day the patient went to WellNow urgent care to get his heel examined. During examination provider noticed patient&#39;s lesions and patient stated more lesions have appeared since getting the vaccine.  1 on his stomach, 1 on the dorsum of his left foot, 1 on his back, 1 on his left elbow, in between his toes of his left foot, and in between the fingers of his right hand. Patient stated that these lesions cause a burning sensation and can become itchy. Patient was sent to Hopsital ED as provider at urgent care was concerned patient may have purpura. Patient was seen and discharged on 4/4/21 from the ED. The heel pain was determined to be plantar fascitis which was treated with at home exercises with a heel cup. The patient was given clotrimazole for his lesions. The patient had a follow-up visit with his primary care provider at hospital on 4/6/21 in which he explained the clotrimazole only made his lesions worse. Patient was referred to follow up with dermatology on 4/8/21. Primary care provider believes progression of the lesions since getting the vaccine leads to concern of an underlying autoimmune exacerbated by vaccine.

                                                About 20 hours after injection, I had mild flu-like symptoms, including headache and muscle ache, lasting about 12 hours. But about 5 days after my injection (5 days &#43; 5 hours, actually), I experienced a bewildering all-over rash that freaked me out. It started as itching around my elbows and ankles -- it felt like mosquito bites and sunburn together -- and spread to wrist and knee areas. The rash climbed by legs and arms. I applied coat after coat of Benadryl, which seemed to help. The rash would disappear and move somewhere else. I had it on my left foot, but then that resolved, only to find it on my right foot. After about 3 hours, it had spread to my stomach, the bridge of my nose, and my cheeks. It started to calm down around midnight. I woke up at 6:00 am (12 hours after onset) with extremely itchy hands. At 8:00 am (14 hours after onset), it had mostly disappeared except for patches on my back, and my wrists still itch. I&#39;m hoping it goes away later today! It was crazy!

Then, after about 23 hours after the injection, bad headache (especially around the eyes - which also caused light sensitivity) and general malaise. Shortly thereafter, low-grade fever (99.5 F) and significant muscle pain, all over the body.  The most worrisome side effect was the last one, which appeared during the second night after the injection (about 32-33 hours after the injection): extremely fast heartbeat / racing heart.   I did not use any treatments for these side effects.

This lasted for several hours after... At 11:30pm, almost 7 hours after the shot, I started to feel lousy. I started to get body aches and chills. Within 30 minutes they were fairly intense body aches and chills, shaking. At 1:00am I started to feel nauseas . At 1:30 am I started dry heaving. At approximately 2:30 I threw up twice, and the dry heaving and nausea lasting until 4am , when I took an anti nausea pill. I finally fell asleep at 430am. I woke up at 8am and felt tired, and no longer nauseated.

                                                5 days post vaccination I experienced sudden onset of generalized hives associated with itchiness. After use of benadryl the hives became more red, less raised, and resembled a confluent measles rash. From association with hives I experienced ear pruritus, sore throat, nausea. And fatigue. Hydrocortisone creme was used on the rash.

                                                I received the J&amp;J vaccine on 3/24, and by that evening I had a headache, and my tinnitus was louder than normal. I had mild barely perceptible tinnitus prior to the vaccine. I would normally never notice it during the day, but lying down and going to sleep in a quiet room I would hear it. Constant high pitch but not loud, in the background more. I always run a fan in my bedroom so that I have some white noise and don&#39;t hear it. I had the flu like headache from the vaccine for two days and then it slowly started to subside into the weekend. I was tired as well from the immune response.  Five days out, I get out of the shower in the morning, and go to put underarm deodorant on, and notice my left armpit is all bright red. I check my right armpit, just as red.. Took photos of the red armpits and shared with some family and friends, as I read on the Internet that there were all kinds of crazy side effects that were possible. The red skin like rash is one of them, although my armpits never itched or burned. I could feel that they were warmer than normal, that was it. It was the 2nd day after my red armpits that my tinnitus ratcheted up to the current level that I am really unhappy with. The red armpits went away within 48 hours, never did anything about the redness, just didn&#39;t put underarm deodorant on until it passed. Sadly, the Tinnitus has remained and it is at a level that is distracting and persistent.

I have had Hives at least once  before while on high-dose (400-600mg) ibuprofin, but never from allergies. Not certain this is related to J&amp;J shot, but doctor said it wouldn&#39;t hurt to report.  Next day stayed indoors. Hives are less common, but still present.

Went to bed at my usual time and woke up at 2:00 am with the chills I could not get warm late that night around 5:00 am I started having joint pain and fatigue with a headache and hot skin. I had taken my temperature and it was 100.7. I tried to wait out symptoms but I seem to bee get worse throughout the morning. Around 10:00 am I was in terrible pain and my body hurt all over. I once again took my temperature and it had gone up to 101.9. I had to call of work because I was so ?out of it?.  I started taking Tylenol ever 4 hrs for my fever and I was trying to hydrate.  My temperature slowly went down but still had body pain. I then started thank ibuprofen to help. Later that night around 9:00 pm my temperature was 99. The next day I called off work for fatigue and body pain. Today my temperature is normal and I?m starting to feel like my self again

                                                Starting 96 hours after vaccination: extreme stabbing pain in left deltoid (injection site).  Soon, this was accompanied by dull but severe pain in left shoulder and upper left back (top of scapula and around collar bone), extending to base of neck. This pain lasted 2 weeks, and was severe enough to prevent patient from sitting or standing for more than a few minutes at a time, especially during the first week of pain. Painkillers (Acetaminophen or NSAIDs) or muscle relaxants (cyclobenzaprine) did not help alleviate the pain. The pain started on March 17, and finally eased up on April 2 (the vaccination was on March 13). There is still some pain and stiffness in the left arm (currently in the biceps), but it is no longer severe. By the way, in addition to the above symptoms starting at 96 hours, there were the usual expected systemic symptoms immediately after the vaccination (starting at 6 hours and ending at 36 hours): light fever, mild body ache, fatigue and mild local pain at injection site.

Took Tylenol 2 doses in 6 hour interval. After a week or so, small red dots (few) under the skin appeared in my fore arms. Subsequently after another week or so, I noticed large number of red dots in my legs. Checked with my primary care physician on 4/28/21 and she ordered blood tests. Blood test report (CBC With Differential/Platelet; Comp. Metabolic Panel (14)) came back and my doctor said, no abnormalities were there. She also tested/checked my lungs, presence of fever (no fever), oxygen saturation - max present. She thought this seems like &#39;Petrichiae&#39;. She recommended I see a dermatologist. Meanwhile, today (5/2/2021), I  noticed another large cluster of red dots on my left arm.

                                                Initial symptoms began with pain at the injection site and generalized fatigue.  This developed into soft tissue pain in proximity of the large and small joints which could be elicited further on palpation.  I had eye pain (left more severe than the right) which could be further elicited on palpation, headache, dizziness, chills, and an inability to feel warm.  There was also significant skin sensitivity over the trunk, scalp, and upper extremities and more in the left arm than the right.  The symptoms persisted over the second day albeit at less severity.  Presently on the third day, I am experiencing continued eye pain, mainly in the left eye and mild dizziness.

The next day There were a couple of sites on my chest, but I took nothing and they didn&#39;t get any worse.

Arm is hard to lift up at some times and weak to lift anything up sometimes. Arm feels week for about 2 to 3 days and then starts to fill better. Then after a day of the soreness or no weakness in the arm, it starts back hurting again. It now getting worse at night time and sometimes during the day. Some days it hurts so bad that I can&#39;t even move it. I don&#39;t bother to tell my wife, because it just last for about a 2 to 3 hours. I have been to my doctor yet. But if it keeps bothering me I will make an appointment to see him.  It just my arm and hand be very weak to use at sometimes every other day.

Temperature started to decrease over the next two days so did the cramping. Then starting on 4/5 I started to experience pain in the back of my head along with the sensation of heat/burning. This was accompanied by a stiff neck. This pain and stiffness persists to today. Medication prescribed by my doctor lessens the discomfort but has not rid me of the issue.

                                                WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS THE ONE AND DONE AND IT WAS THE JANSSEN VACCINE, BUT LOT # IS MODERNA:  He got the vaccine, had no reactions at all for 2 weeks.  Then on Friday, 4/23/21 he woke up early with pain in his left arm near the area of the injection and the back of his arm and to his shoulder like he was hit with a bat.  It did not move the next day and went to his PCP on Tuesday and referenced Ortho and could not find any doctor and his pain was getting worse.  He went to the ER on Wednesday, had a bad experience.  Went back on Friday 4/30/21 and nothing was done for his shoulder and needs to see somebody regarding his arm.  The arm is painful and painful to move in all directions.   They did not do anything for him in the ER, actually made it worse.   The ER said that they could not do an MRI as he needed a referral from an orthopedist for that.    They wanted to check him for his heart, and they would not listen to him.

                                                After getting the shot on Friday at 6:00 pm. I did not have any issues with the shoulder.   Sunday evening around 11pm I have started to have shoulder pain.  The pain is around the area of the injection.  The pain  is generally in the deltoid muscle  and has spread some to the bicep muscle as well.   Uncertain if this is common to the injection process but it caused concern as its onset had been  over 48 hours post injection.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Yellow rash appeared in center of chest. About 6 cm above bottom of sternum. Size is approximately 5 cm x 7 cm. Appearance is light yellow with tint of green and orange. No tenderness in or around the area. No blistering, flaking or other skin abnormalities. Appears to be just discoloration of the skin. No prior experience with symptoms of this type anywhere on body. Discoloration was noticed day after the vaccination when I stepped out of the shower and looked in the mirror. Size, shape, color have remained consistent for past 4 days.

On 4/2/21,  I saw my family MD who instructed me to continue taking benadryl OTC &amp; gave a prescription for topical steroid. On 4/9/21, I saw my family MD for the continued itchy whole body rash who asked me to continue taking OTC benadryl and the prescription topical steroid, he was hesitant to start something else that might interfere with the vaccine&#39;s course. I am to follow up with my family MD 4/16/21 with the thought that enough time will have passed to give something else..

                                                Lost his vaccine card would not give him a new one.  He got his vaccine, had burning sensation immediately after the needle was pulled out.  About 5-10 minutes later he started sweating, and seemed to have calmed down and felt OK.  He was observed for 30 minutes there and went for observation for another 30  minutes.  He went to another doctors office and at about 15:00 started feeling light headed and weak.  He drove back home, picked up some stuff at a grocery store, and outside the grocery store in 80 degree heat he felt the need to put on a jacket as he had the chills.  he went home, went to bed feeling bad, his shoulder was still burning where he got hte vaccin.e  He had a little bit of site pain, applied topical and the pain went away.  He woke up the next morning feeling really bad, felt like a major flu, his head felt like it was going to explode, but no problem with sinuses, no cough, no sneezing.  His eyes were watering from the pain, and chills on and off.  He had to change his sheets a couple of times due to sweating.  He then developed a fever of 99 degrees at about 18:00 that night, and about 19:00 he went to 102 when he checked it.  After that it went to 103, and about 15 minutes after that it was 104, and then higher at 104.&#43;.  He took some vodka, honey and lemon juice and took an alcohol bath and the fever had not broken yet.  He called the clinic and they told him to call 9-1- 1 and to go to the ER.  He went to the ER at about 10:00, gave him fluids, did a chest x-ray and released him about midnight.  He apparently disoriented and tried to walk off and didn&#39;t remember this.  They took him back to the gate and called his son.  He went home, took another bath and woke up in sweat and was in bed for the entire weekend.  He got up Monday morning, 4/13/21 feeling a little bit better and went to see his doctor, who does not believe he was having any side effects and that the information that is being reported is true.   He is still feeling a little weak and still fatigued and on bedrest.  He was taking Advil besides his regular medicines every 6 hours with 500 mg of Tylenol for the intense pain as every joint in his body ached, and the worst headache he had ever had, as well as the high fevers.  His fever subsided on Saturday morning, and still had some sweats following that.  Did have hot/cold flashes on Saturday and Sunday.   He was given a COVID test in the ER and he was negative, but did not give him any other information regarding his lab work.

He also noticed his feet had a rash from his knee to feet, and according to his sister (who is a healthcare professional) it looked like small micro-embolisms (thrombocytopenia). The patient went to his physician who said the spotty red dots could be petechiae caused by thrombocytopenia.  As recommended by his primary care physician, the patient has an appointment for lab work, including platelet counts, on 20-APR-2021. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from headache, tiredness, neck ache, rash from knee to feet (red dots), muscle ache, and possible thrombocytopenia, and the outcome of sleepiness was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 53-year-old male patient was found to have petechiae-like rash on his knees to feet, that according to attending physician could be caused by thrombocytopenia, 2 days after receiving Janssen COVID-19 vaccine for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The patient underwent laboratory procedure including platelet count (results not reported).  The patient complained of neck ache, muscle ache and felt a sense of tiredness, headache, sleepiness that he treated with Aleve (naproxen sodium) on the day the petechiae-like rash appeared.  No other details reported.  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information as requested.

A couple days later I noticed a bump on my neck which I thought was an ingrown hair or bug bite. One week later I had the same low grade fever and the &#39;bump had expanded across my neck and shoulders. Made it in to the doctor a couple days later and was diagnosed with Shingles.  There were no other life stressors that could have caused it, life was good. Now, three weeks later, the pain has diminished but still present. Nerve sensitivity remains.

Felt feverish but didn&#39;t have a fever overnight. The next day the same - general aches and pains and fatigue. Early afternoon, I took Tylenol  and at night time I had  headache and I took Tylenol again that evening (about 11:00P). Next morning, just fatigue - no more aches. Site of vaccination was more sore than initially. I had a sort of sinus headache - left side of face and head. My wife noticed I had bags under my eyes - very odd bags under eyes. I took Sudafed. Inside of my left nostril was aching. Tuesday morning, the bags weren&#39;t there but I got bad acne on the same nostril - my left nostril. It was like - I was worried that the acne was cystic  (very deep - through the nose). I haven&#39;t gotten acne in a long time. I had the sinus headache and acne which lasted two to three days. I tried nasal saline - on that Wednesday and Thursday. The acne lasted into the next week - subsided beginning on the 12th or 13th. The bagginess in eyes  had been gone by end of the 5th. Headaches didn&#39;t persist after the 7th or 8th or so.  Had trouble getting a doctor appt because they didn&#39;t know what doctor to send me to.

                                                I had no noticed issues for about 18 hours after the injection Tuesday evening.  Sometime early Wednesday afternoon I began to experience body aches, a low-grade fever, and extreme tiredness.  I slept most of the rest of the day and night and felt better when I woke up Thursday morning, well enough to go about a normal day.  It is now late Thursday afternoon and I am still a little tired and mildly achy with no fever but otherwise much improved.    One other thing to report, initially there was no pain or tenderness to the injection site but that started changing about 24 hours after the injection.  Now about 46 hours after injection the site has a constant noticeable soreness even if I am not moving my arm.

                                                I had a rash develop I might lower extremities from just below the knees to mid thigh. It happened around 4 p.m. I did not know if it was something that I had come in contact with outside so I took a shower and applied cortisone cream to the rash. Around 6 p.m. I developed a rash on the left side of my chest the rash continue to grow across my chest and my abdomen to both sides and my arms.   Again applied cortisone cream. Around 9 p.m. I took antihistamines and went to bed in the morning the rash is gone. I&#39;m only reporting this because I&#39;ve only read where the rash is on the arm or the injection site where this one was on my lower extremities and my upper extremities chest an abdomen.

                                                About 18 hours after vaccination, I began to feel myalgias and burning skin while in the shower; I began to feel &#34;hot&#34; and very fatigued. Then my temperature went up to 101.9 degrees F, taken by an electronic touchless digital thermometer. Then, the L Deltoid vaccination site began to feel very sore. As the day went on, I felt increasingly fatigued and exhausted,  and had trouble concentrating.   I felt better the 2nd day after vaccination, but felt intermittent myalgias, increasing L Deltoid soreness, and hot and chilled at the end of the day.  Today, I felt better in the morning, exceptfor persistent L deltoid soreness, and fatigue. This evening, I am feeling cold, tired, and myalgias again.

                                                I had a small lump appear at or near the site of injection past the 2 week period. My arm was stiff and sore. My spouse massaged my shoulder and the lump seemed to disappear. Arm felt better. The next day the same thing happened. My spouse massaged my arm and it went away again. I haven&#39;t had any other issues beyond that. I&#39;m not completely sure it is related to the vaccine. I was also in the hospital during this time for an unrelated health issue. I had an obstructed bowel that required surgery. My surgeon assured me that they did nothing to my left arm during the surgery and treatment of the bowel obstruction. After a few conversations with the medical staff and my spouse we thought that the arm issue may have been a side effect of the vaccine shot. That&#39;s why I&#39;m submitting this to you now. So far I haven&#39;t experienced anything else at the injection site. My spouse also had the same vaccine at the same time as me. He hasn&#39;t experienced any of the same effects as I have.

For a few minutes I continued to get warm and at about the 10 minute point I was taken to the waiting room where I got a drink of water.  After drinking the water I felt much better and soon felt normal with the exception of discomfort at the injection site.  (My left upper arm just below my shoulder)  After six days now, I still feel fine overall however, if I message the injection site, I can still feel a little bit of discomfort.

                                                Five days after receiving the vaccine, he started noticing spots on his back with severe itchiness  - his doctor recommended Allegra which he took with some success - the spots pop up in different places everytime. He is now taking allergy medicine twice daily to keep the itching and red spots at bay. His itchiness is now at a &#34;tolerable&#34; level as long as he takes the allergy medicine.

                                                Around 7:00 P.M. on March 12, 2021 approximately 9 hours after receiving the Jansen COVD-19 vaccine in my left arm. I developed extreme fatigue, muscle aches, skin hurt to the touch of anything including clothing, headache, and fever 101.5.  I had to go to bed and was very weak.  I took ibuprofen and Tylenol for the discomfort.  I slept 14 hours and was able to get up at 11:00 A.M. on March 13, 2021.  The soreness at the site of the injection is not problematic.  There were other odd symptoms overnight I would awake with strange nerve like sensations tingling and itching that occurred on the bottom of the left foot, upper lip, and neck.  I also had several episodes of restlessness that was so bad that I had to stand for a few minutes before being able to lay down again.  The worst is the skin hurting and headache.  I have also had a few dizzy episodes since getting out of bed this morning.  It passes if I sit down or hold onto something.  None of these symptoms are normal for me and I cannot remember having a reaction to any vaccinations that I have received in the past.  I hope this helps with your study.

I took Tylenol every 4 hours, but did not improve, only brought the fever down a bit.  Today after 24 hours, I still have headache, muscular aches, and fatigue.

Sat outside in 85 degrees for awhile to try to warm up. About 9pm got in the walk-in shower and sat on bench super hot water. Got out of shower at 9:40pm my skin beet red mostly my chest. Still freezing and body aches. Put on sweatpants and long sleeve t-shirt. Now have A/C off and windows open, 82 degrees outside. My temp taken before I started this form was at 98.7. I ache all over and am freezing. Not shivering though. But have goosebumps on arms under sleeves. I am very uncomfortable. It is now 10:35pm.

                                                1 week after receiving the vaccine, what I believe to be a gout flare started in my right foot.  The joint of my big toe became very swollen and red, painful to the touch and the rest of the front part of my foot also became swollen.  It was difficult to walk or even put pressure on it for 5 days and I treated it with ice, elevation and 600 mg ibuprofen 3X/day.  Symptoms are starting to resolve , but the joint is still swollen and red, though the pain is subsiding.  I am able to walk with a normal gait, though there is still stiffness and some pain.

                                                I began to feel numb around my mouth and nose.  It spread to most of my face, then chest, then arms, mainly left arm and leg, then to both legs.  General weird feeling / numbness, no pain.  I had trouble with limb control, not bad, but enough to notice. Mainly left side, but noticeable  on both sides.  From the onset on face numbness to the chest leg spread was just a matter of a few, maybe 5 minutes.  I looked at my face in the car mirror, and appeared to have facial control.  I was driving to a relatives house, and it worried me. On the way, I also noticed a lump in my right neck, about the size of a pea.  When I got to my relatives house I told them I thought I had a small stroke, but wasn&#39;t sure. The numbness lasted until the next day, then slowly went away.  It took about 2 days before the numb twitchy feeling went away from my left eye/upper cheek area.  The lump in my neck also went away.  rubbing on it actually made the numbness slightly go away. I did not go to a hospital, or seek any treatment.  I think I should have.   I do believe that l had a small stroke / blood clot, and that it should be reported.  I think I am OK now,

                                                About a week after receiving the shot from the hospital, I starting having itching in my elbows then calves and inner thighs and back sides of my knees. It started as blotches in areas. The ones on my arms seemed to have gone away. We have confirmed I am using the same soap, same laundry detergent and same deodorant. It was the worst on 4/4/21. So I have started to bathe in epson salt each day and not only shower. 4/5/21 it was high  on my thighs. Trying to minimize itching. I also tried to apply a 1% hydrocortisone anti itch cream the last last few days. The redness has been reduced today. I have pictures of it growing.  I think getting better.

                                                on 4/2 the day after the vaccine a large rash with hives developed around my neck   I took benadryl 50mg and it subsided .  Then on 4/4 (sunday) I went to sleep early around 8pm  Wasnt feeling well. I woke up around 2 hours later   I had a bad rash with hives in my groin, on my torso, again on my neck, scalp and palms of my hands.  My hands were covered in hives.   I took 125mg of Benadryl at 10pm and had a prednisone prescription at home similar to a medrol dose pak   So I took 6 prednisone 5mg at 10pm and 5 prednisone 5mg early the next morning around 5am 4/5. I also added more benadryl around 2am (50mg) and 6am (50mg) By the morning  tho the rash was very visible and still raised on my palms, neck and groin.  I went to the doctor and he examined me and he felt in the absence of any other factors like new deodorant, shampoo , or new laundry soap that it was likely the vaccine.   I finished a five day course of the steroid and im completely back to normal.

                                                The day after the vaccine the patient developed a fever lasting one day, and a very pruritic rash over his trunk, arms/hands as well as a few lesions over his scalp and face. The rash persisted, and per the photos that he emailed to the office was maculopapular in nature. I instructed the patient to take cetirizine 10 mg twice daily, and within 4-5 days the rash had completely resolved.

Then on April 12, 2021 after working throughout the morning sitting in front of my computer, I took a lunch break.  While preparing a meal, I felt discomfort in the left eye and it became very uncomfortable. When I checked in the mirror, I discovered my left eye was filling with blood.  Upon seeing an eye doctor that same afternoon, the doctor explained that my left eye had ruptrued a large vessel and hemmoraged. However, the reason for the hemmorage could not determined because I was not under stress, had not lifted anything heavy, was not on blood thinner medication, was not constipated and have no underlying health condition.

Starting about 10-14 days after receiving the vaccine (IM into my deltoid), I have been experiencing a regional (almost dermatomal) distribution itchiness and hypersensitivity in my left infrascapular and upper lateral back region. It&#39;s a superficial (dermal/epidermal) discomfort, not deep. I have observed NO associated rash or hives; nothing is visually evident. I am still experiencing this at day 19 post vaccine. I&#39;ve not taken any medication, have not applied any topicals, etc.

I went to see my doctor, and she said it was a reaction to the vaccine. One of the nurses said the vaccine probably triggered my eczema and they have been seeing it a lot. She gave me a Vitamin D ointment and told me to use my eczema meds as well. It took a while to clear up, but it&#39;s better.
