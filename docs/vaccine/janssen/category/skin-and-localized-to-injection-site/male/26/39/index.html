                                                Went most of the day with no symptoms. Performed a High Intensity Workout around 7pm for an hour, and ate shortly after. Took a hot shower and relaxed before bed time around 10pm started to have a headache. By 10:45 when I went to sleep it was an intense headache. Under the covers my body was incredibly hot, without covers I was freezing cold. I woke up around midnight in a sweat and again around 2:30am when I called in sick to work. I then sat in my bathroom for 30 minutes, threw up once, and then feeling much better (Still had an intense headache) I drank some water and fell back asleep in my room. Today is the second day, I have a small headache, have not eaten all day, and slept most of the afternoon. I highly recommend not working out the same day of getting the vaccine, I didn&#39;t think to ask about that when I received it. I doubt I would have had this problem if I rested instead.

After awaking he doesn&#39;t remember the last 5 minutes. He laid down to go to sleep and was consistently hot and then cold. He does have a history of night terrors but they have remained dormant for about 2.5 years. Around 12 am he started having one of the worst night terrors I&#39;ve seen. The following morning, April 2nd 2021, he was feeling incredibly sore and the injection spot was tender. He said &#34;it feels like I got hit by a truck.&#34; Seems to be doing okay otherwise now.

I developed a rash that began hurting, and believed I was having symptoms of shingles. I made a visit to my GP whom also believed it was a shingles infection and began antiviral treatment.

                                                Only minor chills before bed, 11pm. Muscle aches, felt as tightness in IT bands, made remaining asleep difficult. Got up to use the bathroom around 5am. Upon finishing peeing while standing, I lost consciousness, falling. As a result of the fall, I fractured my cheek bone, cut open my ear, later requiring three stitches, and was concussed, resulting in a loss of memory. I was nonresponsive when my fiance found me immediately following the crash, and was rushed to the hospital  via ambulance. Upon arrival to the hospital, my fever was found to be 102 F. As a result of the fall, I have a cheek bone fracture, three stiches in my ear, and a concussion.

After reaching my home even after few hours also I didnt have any symptoms. But before I went to sleep (around 12:30 am ), i started to have mild pain near the vaccination sight. Even during my sleep i felt okay, but as soon as I woke up (around 09:00 am) i felt mild symptoms on pain, as I started attending to my regular activties right after 10:00 am, i started to feel severe chills, fever,  body pains, lazyness, moderate headache and severe pain at vaccination site. Again I had some food and slept due to severe body pains and even through the sleep also I had severe body pains, fever, nausea and lazyness. As I woke up after my evening nap of 3 hours, i woke up at 6:00 pm and felt chills, body pains., fever and nausea.

Then he felt like he fell asleep until the person checking him called at him.  He had some vision and hearing impairment at the beginning, then after 10 minutes he was better. His arm was hot, he was sweating, his skin was turning white color.  His mom came (she was shopping) and said the patient is usually an anxious person, so it was overwhelming to be at department store and getting the shot.  After another 10 minutes, he was drinking water, his senses were back, he was fine.

I did not observe him seizing. He did have a red spot on his forehead where his head hit the wall. He was also sweating. His friend stated that he seized for less than 5 seconds.   - I gave the patient a frozen water bottle for his head and a room temperature water bottle.   - The patient stated he did not want to pay for an ambulance which I relayed to her .   - The EMT did arrive anyway and checked on the patient.   - The patient and his friend left the store together, without EMT support or transfer.   - The EMT team did not communicate with me prior to leaving the store.

I then went to sleep and woke up with a throbbing migraine and my legs were so sore I wanted to cut them off.  I could barely walk they were so tight.  I have now been getting bruising on my legs.  I don&#39;t know if it is due to the shot though.  I shaved my legs and I usually get some bruising after that.  My arms have been slightly tense and sore as well.  I have reasons outside of the shot to believe that it may not be the vaccine, but I thought I should report it.

He returned and stated that he felt dizzy and fell. He cut his elbow from the fall. He stated that dizziness is all that he experienced. I advise him to sit in the waiting area for about 30 minutes so that we could continue to monitor him.

                                                Pt received the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. Pt started to feel numbness and tingling in his left hand (vaccinated arm) 15 minutes following the immunization. Pt stated that he felt fine other than his left hand experiencing numbness and tingling, specifically in his fingertips. Pt had no other adverse symptoms. I asked the pt to remain seated for an additional 15 minutes. He stated that he was ok but I convinced him to remain in his seat so we could continue to evaluate him. After a total of 45 minutes of evaluation, pt stated that the feeling of numbness and tingling was gone. Once again, I verified with the pt that he was feeling ok, with no additional adverse feeling or symptoms. Pt stated that he felt fine now and only felt a little soreness at the injection site.

I went for a walk for about 40 mins started to feel worse. I had body aches throughout my back and chest and in both arms, was freezing. Tried to eat dinner but couldn?t, too much pain and increased nausea. Tried to lay down, but began having a fast heartbeat and fast/some difficulty breathing. The pain in my chest was the worst pain I?ve ever felt. Continued feeling horrible with a fever of 100.7, nausea, headache pains throughout chest back and arms, freezing, and my arms and legs felt like they were becoming numb. Could not stand, very dizzy, tried to sleep through it. I threw up around 11 and did so a couple more times after that. Was finally able to sleep and woke up feeling much better. Arm is still sore at the injection point.

By the time I went to bed,  my body was extremely sensitive. Entering my bed was painful due to the cold sheets, the cold was contrasted by the occasional heat flash. The night was full of body aches, hot and cold flashes, and loads of sweating. I woke up with a headache and body soreness. That was the worst of it. Spent the remainder of the day resting in bed.  Notes: I rarely get sick, maybe like this once every few years. I probably could have drank more water to flush out my system following the shot.

Patient reports the immunization hurt a lot more than it usually does when patient receives a vaccine. The following day arm and shoulder continued to hurt. After a few days the muscle became less painful but the pain in the shoulder continued and was deeper as if it was in the shoulder joint itself. Over five weeks later the pain is still sharp within the shoulder with reaching up or across. Patient reports no pain without movement. No numbness, tingling, redness, swelling, bruising, fever, chills, recent injury, or weakness documented. Ibuprofen was not helpful. Patient administered steroid injection during visit and follow-up with physical therapy arranged. Patient reports mild pain relief after injection.

                                                Muscle aches in armpits began a few hours after receiving the dose.  Within 8 hours of dose, a mild fever and chills began (around 100 degrees F). I attempted to take a bath to soothe aches but it did not help, and instead tried to go to sleep at 8:30 pm. A slight red rash appeared on chest and arms around this time.  I was woken up at 10:30 pm feeling disoriented and hot, with a fever of 104.5 degrees F. My wife noticed slurring of words and that I seemed unstable and confused, and symptoms were severe enough we considered going to the emergency room.  I experienced ringing in my ears and a severe headache.  I took 2 extra strength Tylenol, put a cold cloth on forehead, and drank fluids to fall back asleep.  Fever dropped to around 102 but continued throughout the night.  I woke up at 6:30 am and took two more Tylenol.  The severe headache continued and I vomited twice.  I attempted to take a shower and rinse off, and continue to rest.  Fever is reduced to 99 degrees F with help of Tylenol.

At 6:35, he said he had left arm weakness (arm he received vaccine in), fatigue, was dizzy, and felt &#34;off&#34;.  Patient did not lose consciousness and refused an ice pack.  BP checked at 6:38pm (170/98, pulse 105).  Patient stated his blood pressure usually runs high. I offered him an ice pack a second time, but he said there was no need and he felt better.  BP checked again 6:52pm (152/101, pulse 99).  I recommended that since his blood pressure is usually this high, he should follow up with his primary doctor regarding blood pressure as he may need some medication to assist in lowering it.  He said ok.  He left the pharmacy area at 7:02pm and said he was fine to leave, he did not want to remain any longer.

                                                Jansen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  On 04/12/2021 at 11:30pm (5 days after I was originally vaccinated), I started to itch inside of the crooks of both of my arms were starting to itch. After a few minutes of not scratching the crooks of my arms, I had noticed that both crooks of my arms were still red. I then took off my shirt and realized that I had an extensive rash with hives all over my trunk. I also had a sudden onset of nasal congestion and sneezing during this same time period. I took Benadryl and Pepsid on that same night and then saw my primary care doctor the following morning. My primary care doctor diagnosed my rash/hives as a probable result. I was instructed to continue with the Benadryl and Pepsid and watch for any changes.

As the day went on the rash progressed and swelling of lips and uvula occurred around 5pm. I was taken to an urgent care who transferred me to a hospital via rescue. I spent the night at the hospital receiving multiple epi pen injections, and fluids. I was discharged 5/22 with a dose of prednisone. I was fatigued all day. On 5/23 I woke up to swollen eyes and lips and covered in hives again. I went to the ER where I was given steroids and fluids again. The hives went down but did not go away.  One 5/24 I took multiple doses of Benadryl and dose of prednisone and in the evening time the hives progressed. Today 5/25 I woke up with swollen lips and checks and hives. I went to my doctors office to be evaluated.

Enough to fall asleep for a couple hours.   2 hours after I got the shot I started feeling effects. I didn?t sleep until 0400 in the morning because I was in so much pain. Today I have a headache and my body is sore but I feel a lot better.  If I didn?t live so far away from my friends or coworkers I would have gone to the hospital. I was too weak and sick to use my phone.

Next morning (3-15) low temp of 97.1 degrees, headache, fatigue, lightheaded. Still feel headachy and tired.

                                                I received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA at roughly 2:15pm on Sunday 4/11/21. I waited at the vaccination site for 30 minutes and did not have any adverse effects. I went through the rest of my day without any adverse effects. I went to bed at 9:00pm. I woke up at 11:00pm with body aches and chills. I could not stop shivering. I then became very warm. I alternated between freezing/shivering and burning up all night. I felt very sore and my muscles hurt. It was primarily my upper body that hurt, not my lower body. My arms, torso, back, and neck hurt to move. I was very sensitive to everything I touched. It felt uncomfortable to touch the blankets in my bed or the water when I washed my hands. It did not hurt to do that, it just felt sensitive and uncomfortable. Around 5:00am I got a terrible headache. It felt like my head was made out of a lead ball. It hurt to move lift my head. My face hurt and felt like I had pressure. This lasted all day for Monday 4/12/21. After 5:00pm I slowly started to feel better. My body aches went away. I still had a headache, but it was far less severe. It is approximately 7:00am on 4/13/21 as I am filling this out. I still have a minor but persisting headache. My left arm is sore at the injection site. I am feeling much better than I was.

Hives eventually were limited to only arms after 3 days. 7 days after experiencing on and off hives, I took an antihistamine until hives disappeared for longer than 24 hours.  Hives were not itchy, but large and warm to the touch. No single hive lasted for more than 24 hours.  They disappear and reappear randomly on my arms. Specially over veins. It has been over a month since my vaccine and I?m still experiencing these hives that appear and disappear at random. I?ve documented each hive outbreak with photos and currently undergoing blood tests trying to learn more about this issue.

On the evening of the 7th day, I developed a rash around my ankles and on my arm around the injection site.  That has spread into a full-body rash which is extremely itchy.  Antihistamines have helped (Benedryl) but only provide temporary relief. Significant discomfort.

                                                I started feeling fatigue and soreness in both of my legs and arms about a 5 after the vaccine. At day 7 I started to feel sharp, cramps, tingly sensation and numbness in different parts of my legs, arms feet and hands. I also had headaches and felt dizzy. Headaches went away by day 15, but the pain, tingly sensation and fatigue in my arms and legs still remain (tomorrow it?s going to be a month since I got my shot). It gets significantly worse when I walk and I feel very fatigued after walking for about 30 minutes.  The pin has also appeared less frequently on other parts of my body, like my heart, my neck and around my rib area. Over the last two weeks my legs have also been getting itchy.

Have never had prior skin rashes or other skin issues other than Vitiligo which I have had since teen years but has not spread since 17-18 years of age. Started as an itch on right chest/armpit area and quickly reddened/blistered. Now taking anti-virals to prevent spread and steroid cream for itching/pain. Has not spread since starting the anti-viral and it is contained to the chest, armpit, and slightly on back.

Patient became alert and oriented as well as stopped the bleeding before paramedics arrived. After being assessed by the paramedics, he requested not to go to the hospital and to leave on his own. I requested the patient sit for another 15 minutes before leaving to which he obliged and thanked me before leaving.

                                                Immediately after injection: pain and soreness around injection site.  Starting about 3-4 hours later: impaired coordination.  The next morning: severe dehydration, disorientation, loss of balance, very low energy, headache, body aches, inability to remain standing or sitting, difficulty walking, fever, feeling hot and cold, sweating and shivering intermittently and sometimes both at the same time, impaired mental focus, worsened pain and soreness around the injection site, nightmares. Slept the majority of the day, rising only to eat and drink lots of water.  Symptoms abated throughout the day. By about 7pm, I was able to sit up enough to play some video games.  The second morning: most symptoms gone or almost unnoticeable.  Hot/cold flashes, impaired coordination and low energy continue, but improving. Attempted to go out for my usual 2-mile jog after work, but only made it about one block walking before becoming both too cold and too tired to continue.  The third day, afternoon: completed my usual 2-mile route, at a walk, with frequent stops to rest.  No noticeable symptoms from the 4th day after injection, onwards.

                                                I received the vaccine on Wednesday, April 7th.  I was told I had an anaphylactic reaction at the time of injection: I started sweating upon receiving the vaccine, my blood pressure dropped, and I almost passed out. I was monitored for 30 mins before being sent home. Other than some fatigue, I was fine the rest of the day.  On Thursday, April 8th, I was tired but felt fine otherwise.  Friday and Saturday, April 9th and 10th, I felt like I was back to normal and even did some light exercise.  On Sunday morning, April 10th, the left side of my body (side of injection) went numb, I had extreme vertigo, shortness of breath, and blotches that appeared in random places. It didn&#39;t look like hives, but rather looked like strips of red. I didn&#39;t feel like I was having an allergic reaction, but something did not feel right. I consider myself a pretty healthy guy with a healthy lifestyle. I did not feel the need to go to the ER quite yet, but I did have a friend come over to monitor me.  My friend did some acupuncture which helped resolve the numbness and dizziness and some of the blotches, and also mentioned concerns regarding blood circulation and potential clotting issues she thought I was having.

I had the Janssen vaccine shot at around 5PM on Thursday and felt mostly fine on Friday. I had typical shot symptoms (tired and soreness near injection sight). On Friday night around 10:00, I was standing talking to one of my friends in the living room when I had a blackout seizure without any warning. The seizure only lasted about 30-45 seconds, and then I became conscious again. It took me about 5-10 minutes to become completely aware and able to stand up. I have never had a seizure before and have not had one since then.  Later the following week, I did have a couple of hours where I felt extremely dizzy and lightheaded, but it went away without another seizure. This is also not typical for me.

When the exhaustion would hit, starting the day after injection, I was too weak to go up and down stairs. It seemed significant and was more than normal tiredness, and I ended up needing to take a half day at work four days after vaccination. On the sixth day after vaccination, I was feeling well again and discomfort at the injection site had subsided as well.  It was the worst the day after getting vaccinated, which was to be expected. I did not expect it to last so long.

                                                Moderate Itchiness all over the body. The onset of the itchiness was within 1 hour of the vaccine. The itchiness has persisted every day since then. The itchiness is most itchy in the groin/scrotrum region and inner thighs. Other parts of the scrotum/groin are also itchy every day ever since getting the vaccine. The individual has no STDs and had only normal male itching prior to the vaccine.   There is also itching on the arms, lower neck/sides of neck, thighs, and sides of the back, but not as intense itching as the areas described above. I had never experienced generalized itching on my body ever before getting the JNJ vaccine and am positive it is related.

Patient received his vaccine on his right arm, remained seated in his chair. A few seconds later, he decided to lie down on the floor, removed his mask and started taking deep breaths with his eyes closed. About 3 minutes later, his eyes got dilated, skin started flushing red, started with mild seizure like twitching and patient became unresponsive. So I quick put some ice cold water (from his water bottle) on his face, patted his cheek, put an ice pack on his face and neck and while I was asking his father (who was with him) to call 911, the patient regained consciousness and said he was okay.  He continued to put the ice pack on his neck and forehead and in a few minutes the flushing stopped, in about 5 to 8 minutes, patient was able to sit up, lean back against the wall, take a few sips of water and the eat a granola bar. Patient then proceeded to wait in our waiting area for another 15 minutes and then decided to leave , since he was feeling much better.

Itching started on the back of my hands and then progressed to the tops of my feet and rose up my legs, I took 2 Benadryl and went to urgent care.  The Benadryl started working within a half hour of taking it.   The itching started as o laid in bed where the only food or liquid I consumed before getting out of bed was a bottled water.  The doctor stated that I may be allergic to the pba?s in the water bottle.   I have never been allergic to this before  I was given this vaccine.  Intense itching and  hives have been occurring  ever since that day and without taking Claritin  or Benadryl daily  the itching and hives takes over my whole body.  I fear I could go into anaphylaxis if I do not take this medication.  I have cut out several different foods and different liquids including bottled water and have fasted yet still am getting a allergic reaction.  I saw my family dr and he said it?s likely due to the Johnson and Johnson covid 19 vaccine and I believe that to be true.  Other symptoms include facial flushing and upset stomach

                                                At 23:15 (7 hours after the dose) I started to get cold while under my blankets trying to sleep. My teeth began chattering as I started to shiver. I got up out of bed to put on a sweater. With each step I took towards the sweater my body started to fully shiver and contract. After about 4 or 5 steps I could no longer move and I fell over. I started having full body spasms and full contractions. I felt like I pulled every muscle in my body trying to relax and fight the contractions. It felt like I was being tasered for about 10-15 minutes. Once I had the strength to grab my sweater I slipped it on. As my body warmed up these contraction subsided.  By 01:00 (9 hours after dose) my body temperature had spiked. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer to check my temperature but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I spiked a fever. I placed a wet cloth on the back of my neck, forehead and chest to cool down.   At 06:00 (14 hours after dose) I took a cold shower to further drop my body&#39;s temperature. It felt like a full body sun burn where you just radiate heat. I was hot everywhere.  At 08:00 (16 hours after dose) I took three (3) 500mg ibuprofen to help fight a nagging headache. I did not have much appetite for food. I regularly eat breakfast in the morning (bowl of cereal).   From 09:00 to 12:00 (17-20 hours after dose) I felt groggy. Did not seem or act like myself. Was very tired from the lack of sleep the night prior. Seemed very fatigued.  Around 13:00 (21 hours after dose) I took a 45-60 minute nap. Woke up feeling much better. I would say most / if not all symptoms subsided after 22-24 hours.

The next day my eye was more irritated, and it was uncomfortable. I had a telehealth visit and they gave me antibiotic drops. I was diagnosed by an optometrist on the five days after the vaccine with the Shingles virus. The Shingles are still present on my eye after three weeks and I am taking steroids for that.

                                                I got my Covid vaccine on Wednesday, 5/5/21. That night I experienced the typical side effects (Chills, Aches, Pains, Soreness in the injection site on my right arm). By Thursday afternoon I was feeling significantly better. However, on Friday evening I started to feel a tightness and pressure in my chest and left arm and neck. The chest pain felt like I was having a heart attack but my heart rate was mostly normal. I felt shortness of breath  where I couldn&#39;t get a good deep breath in and I was also nauseous and had no appetite. At times I felt lightheaded and weak. These symptoms continued over the next couple days. On Monday 5/10/21 I decided to got to the ER to get checkout since I was still having chest pains and tightness. They ran a series of tests and concluded that I was just experiencing typical aches and pains from the vaccine.  My symptoms continued for another full week and at times the shortness of breath and chest pains felt really severe. By the following week I was starting to feel a little better on and off. I got my appetite back and and I was able to start exercising again. After about 2 full weeks after receiving the vaccine most of chest pain and pressure &#43; shortness of breath has disappeared and I feel better.

                                                On Saturday, I woke up to my right arm - at injection site area - was itching. I woke up to numerous nose bleeds. I&#39;m not prone to nose bleeds. Also - consistent since Saturday, Diarrhea; muscles aches; fatigue; vomiting. Problems with keeping liquid and food down now - just started a couple of days ago. Dr called me on Friday -I was doing okay; On Monday - he called again and I wasn&#39;t doing well. Have spoken to my doctor each day. And now  (since two days ago) it feels like my skin is tearing apart and burning and that the inside of my bones are on fire. At the same time, I couldn&#39;t keep food and liquid down anymore. Autonomic immune system is in fight response since Saturday. Haven&#39;t been able to get out of bed for last two days. Diarrhea has worsened. - Have been taking Zofran - nausea med for the last two days. To subdue the vomiting. Have a new medication that I am starting today to subdue the diarrhea - can&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called. Trying to make sure it doesn&#39;t go into an autonomic crisis. Only Telemed visits so far - video appts. Have had several fevers doing this time - currently at 100 but went up to 103. I have gone to low grade too and means I have not been doing well at all - on Saturday to Sunday. (Went to high grade - Mon, Tuesday, Wednesday).

                                                It was a fully body rash the developed over the course of 24 hours.  The night before I noticed a bit of itching an a bump that seemed like a bug bite. The following morning I had many such bumps in clusters on my neck and arm (and a few more bumps on my legs). At the time I thought I had bed bugs. By about 6 PM, I had more bumps and many of them had spread and turned into welts. There were bumps and rashes on all limbs, my neck and redness on my chest and back, The itchiness was severe. While not extremely painful, it was extremely uncomfortable and seemed like it would be hard to sleep or do anything.  Around 9 PM I took Allegra to try and alleviate symptoms. I also used hydrocortison cream and calamine lotion all over my body to reduce symptoms of itching.  By around 11 PM, I the rash was spreading into my face in the form of some bumps and redness. I visited the ER after consultation with a nurse over the phone, who said that anaphylactic shock could be a possibility and that it would be best to go in.  At the ER, I was treated with 50 mg diphenhydrAMINE , 20 mg famotidine , 10 mg dexAMETHasone. I was given a prescription for dexAMETHasone and instructed to take a refill in 3 days if I still had symptoms. I was discharged a couple hours later.  I did not need to refill the dexAMETHasone  as the sympoms subsided and was almost unnoticeable by day 3 (and completely gone by day 4).

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the injection, I became dizzy and lightheaded. My  eyesight became blurry and my hearing very &#34;tinny&#34;. I felt nausea and  thought I was going to throw up. I sat down in a chair and was given a granola bar and some water. After about 3 or 4 minutes the majority of these  seemed to fade, but I still felt slightly &#34;off&#34;. Approximately 9pm that evening I felt very fatigued, so I went to bed. At approximately midnight, I woke up shivering, extremely cold, and sweating. Around 2am I had a fever of 102.3. I took some Tylenol to try to bring my fever down, which seemed to help. Around 9am the next morning my fever was gone, though I still felt extremely fatigued.  Later that evening, after several naps, I started to feel a little better. Most of these adverse events were resolved by 28 hours after injection. I had arm soreness at the injection sight that felt like having been punched in the arm for about a week after the injection.

I went to check on him and he was yellowish in color and barely able to speak to me. I asked another pharmacist to get me a cold pack and water. By the time we got the cold pack and water, he was not speaking, but eyes were open. I called 911 and the other pharmacist fanned him and placed the cold pack on his head and neck. He started talking within minutes and we waited for ambulance to come just to check him out. He was ablet to verify his name and where he was and EMSA came at 3:50pm. He left to their truck and said he was okay just felt shaky and clammy, but he could hear everyone talking to him.

                                                I typically faint when getting shots or blood drawn. I did faint about 10 seconds after the initial shot injection. I was conscious throughout but was not able to speak clearly or control my body even though I could hear everything going on around me. After 30 minutes, I was feeling back to normal. The remainder of the day I felt drowsy and a little out of it. At 12:15am I began to get severe chills and shakes. This lasted throughout the night but was the worst from about 12:15-1:00am. I woke up at 4am with a fever and sweating. My entire body was stiff and in pain with aches specifically in my arms and legs. Very sore pain in my left deltoid where the shot was injected and is still slightly sensitive. It felt like my veins were stiff and in pain and it hurt to move. I had what I can describe as flu like symptoms (i.e. my teeth hurt, my body ached, fever, shakes, body stiffness and overall tiredness and weakness). These all lasted until about 6:30am at the worst and were relieved over the next few hours. I started to feel back to normal around 3pm later that day. That was April 11th. Last night, April 12th, I had trouble sleeping because my left arm was in pain from my elbow to fingers. It was a lingering pain that went away by this morning and  is mostly gone now (morning April 13th).

I started feeling flu like fatigue, body aches, and a headache 8 hours post injection. I ran a 101&#43; fever Monday night and got less than 4 hours sleep due to fever and fairly intense muscle aches. On Tuesday morning the headache, fever and muscle aches persisted till the late evening accompanied by general fatigue. By 9:00 on Tuesday night I was feeling significant improvement and slept well Tuesday night with minor night sweats on and off. Wednesday morning I felt 80% back to normal. No fever, minor headache only evident when standing up quickly or sudden head movement, and continued muscles aches body wide specifically in the neck and chest as well as injection site muscle soreness. These symptoms continue to persist into Thursday at the same or perhaps slightly elevated levels. Friday 4/15 symptoms persist with generalized soreness, fatigue, headache,  injection site soreness. Not his typical self.

                                                Covid-19 vaccine JJ: 32 y.o. male w/ no PMH presenting 2 weeks after receiving his Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID vaccine after having severe L calf pain found to have thrombocytopenia.    From H&amp;P on 4/21, Patient reports that he had both fevers and aches after his vaccine (4/8/2021). Several days later developed low back pain radiating into his left leg which he initially attributed to sciatica. However, several days later, he went for a 6 mile hike, and felt that his left leg was hurting more. He went to PCP, where he received a blood test and was found to have a platelet count in the low 60s. This was initially thought to be a lab error, but he noticed that his left leg was swollen, somewhat red, and appeared that his blood vessels were swollen. This swelling resolves when he is lying down, and is worsened when he is standing. He received an US to r/o DVT, which was negative. However, after his repeat platelet count demonstrated thrombocytopenia, he was sent to the ED. He denies any recent leg trauma, though he has broken his leg before nearly 15 years ago.  He denies weakness or issues going to the bathroom. Denies chest pain or shortness of breath. Denies chills, fevers, but did wake up last 2 nights drenched in sweat. He also reports a petechial rash on his legs.   As of 4/22, medical team suspects Vaccine-induced thrombocytopenic purpura (VITT). VITT requires 1) thrombocytopenia, 2) documented clot, 3) positive PF4 Ab, and 4) recent AstraZeneca or J&amp;J vaccine. He meets criteria 1, 3, and 4. He has clinical signs of DVT but does not have a documented clot. Patient has L calf tenderness and prominent pooling of blood and vein engorgement of the L leg when he stands up. Possible that he had a DVT or multiple that cleared and now he has post-thrombotic syndrome. This is consistent with the pooling of blood with gravity and relief of symptoms with elevation. As he has had 2 negative US for DVT, unlikely that he has an unresolved DVT. abdominal and head CT are neg for thrombosis.

                                                On 03-04-2021 I started to experience respiratory problems, my nose was clogged up with mucus, had some difficulty breathing and was having like an asthma attack. I do not suffer from asthma prior to this vaccine. I experienced headaches, fatigue, congestion, my ears were plugged and I also developed a rash on my arms and I also noticed a lymph node in my neck that I did not have prior to the vaccine. When I went to see my doctor my symptoms were not as prominent and the lymph node in my neck is decreasing in size.

                                                Day of vaccination:  Pain/soreness at injection site and nearby arm muscles.  Took acetaminophen day of vaccination, which helped, and soreness has lessened over time, but still lingers. Morning after vaccination:  Muscle aches, chills, feverish.  Took acetaminophen every 6 hours and it helped somewhat, particularly in the morning, but was less effective as the day went on. Next day:  felt mostly better from feverish symptoms.  Pain/tenderness in arm has continued but lessened over time.

Pharmacist administered the vaccine, filled out his paperwork, and then stood up.  Pt stood up.  Pharmacist started to ask him to wait in the pharmacy waiting area for 15 minutes so we could make sure that he did not have a reaction.  Before the pharmacist could finish, the Patient started to sway.  He leaned against the wall, started to bend over, hit his head on the wall, and passed out.  The pharmacist called for help from the other staff.  Pt&#39;s legs were lifted up so that his feet were resting on the chair.  He had hit the bridge of his nose against the wall/side of door.  His nose was swelling up, turning black and blue, and was starting to bleed.  After about 15 seconds, the patient came around.  He was able to answer questions coherently.  He stated that he did  not need an ambulance.  Pharmacist retrieved a couple of ice packs for him and put his coat under his head.  Patient remained lying down for approximately 30 minutes before he stood up.  When he stood up, he did not sway and seemed stable.  Pt declined the pharmacy staff to contact someone to drive him home.

Prior COVID, I went to martial arts 4 times a week and went to the gym 4-5 times a week still. My awareness was not good, hand dexterity was not as high, concentrating was not easy for long, high blood pressure, pre diabetic now,  fatty liver, gallbladder stones/sludge, have high wbc count, rbc count high, high alt/ast range is 44-88-116-222, skin sensititivty, could only stay awake for 6 hours at a time.  BTold to introduce coffee to help liver/ keep taking baby aspirin/ put back on Dexilant 60mg. When working out, I go to sleep within an hour of running 1 mile,  weight lifting gets me extremely tired now, now its not as bad, can work out longer.  In may, all my allergies disappeared, now they are back but in first month I was no longer allergic to fruits. This is new and started in June, pimples on skull and ears, voice is normal now, may have grown taller, leg shins hurt when touched. Skin still very sensitive, awake longer now  but when I work out I still get tired where I have to stop, sit, or nap.

                                                I sat down for 15 min and felt fine for the rest of the day. The hives started about 30 mins after I had dinner. It started on my shoulders and back, so I took a Benadryl, which was expired. So, I went to get some more and took a second dose around midnight. I won&#39;t up with none, but they were back around noon. That happened for a few days with it happening around lunch and dinner. On Tues, they started spreading more, so I went to the doctor. There was no swelling of the tongue. They lessened over the next couple of days. As of today, I have a small amount of itching, but nothing bad. I&#39;ve also been taking Claritin since yesterday. I have not seen any the same size as before, but I notice that they seem to be worse at night. I took my BP a few times and it was high at those times, but it went back to normal the next day. I will be seeing an allergist in the near future.

I got up to go to the bathroom and upon finishing, I felt my heart rate skyrocket and felt faint. I immediately went back to the bed where I lost consciousness. My wife said my eyes were open and my body was rigid. I came too within a minute of that and was breathing heavy and sweating and very fatigued. My wife had called 911 as I was coming back to consciousness. The EMTs checked my vitals and all was normal. They asked if I wanted to go to the hospital, and I said no. My back was extremely sore all day, and I developed small red spots around my eyes. I went to my doctor later that day and told them about it. They took my blood for tests, which I have not heard back about, and they did not conclude anything, but did set me up with an appointment for an MRI of my head, given my past history.

                                                Within maybe 20-30 minutes of vaccination, I noticed a small dull pain in my right calf;  I disregarded and walked back to the car.  This pain has reduced over the last week, but is still vaguely present.  5-6 hours after vaccination, headache and strong sinus-headache.  Laid down to rest.  I woke up around 20-30 minutes later with full body tremors and muscle spasms.  Muscle spasms particularly violent in my back, feeling similar to if someone was involuntarily using one of those muscle-stimulator elecrode pad systems on  me;  could feel each individual muscle tensing and releasing at random.  Tremors and spasms persisted and then diminished over the next 4-5 hours.   99.7F fever was recorded.   Chills, fever, nightsweats, and repeated sleepless rest/waking every 30-40 minutes until the next day.  Headache was still strong and present at 4am,  took 600mg ibuprofen and continued hydrating.  Headache, general soreness, and fever persisted for ~3 days, but manageable with hydration and rest.  On day 3 a rash appeared on both my knees/innerthigh just above the knee.  Likely not hives, subdermal red speckles that appeared at night;  close to 4mm in diameter, skin was warm to the touch and very itchy.  Most of the rash was gone by morning, and the itching and warmth was completely gone.  I have noticed a very similar rash appear on my front left collar/shoulder area just this morning, but no itch/warmth.  Outcomes: Muscle spasms/tremors subsided within a day. Fever/headache subsided within 3 days Knee/Thigh rash gone. More similar rash just appeared on upper left shoulder/collar. Upper calf dull pain still present, but only barely  &#34;It feels a bit off&#34; would be the best description.

                                                Just before bed, about a week after getting the vaccine, I started to itch on my feet and arms. I fell asleep and woke up at about 3 AM with incredibly itchy skin from the tops of my feet all the way up to my shoulders. It was so itchy and uncomfortable that it woke me up. I took 2 Benadryl and put some anti-itch lotion on, and was able to fall asleep. I woke up the next morning feeling groggy, but better. The itch has not returned at all in the week since this happened.

Pain in various joints is very noticeable by 9:00am the day after injection. Left hip joint pain up to a 6/10 on pain scale. Also pain in right hip, knees, and right shoulder, not to exceed a 4 or 5 on pain scale. Also at 9:00am on Day 2, headache is quite noticeable and persisting through Day 2. I rarely get headaches normally.

                                                On the evening of 4/8/2021 at around 8 pm I began experiencing an upset stomach (felt like I might throw up) and then shaking in my stomach started and I got a lot of chills and a headache.  Then I spiked a very high fever and sweat like crazy.  I was shaking like crazy and had to call a doctor on call twice.  I had full body pain and was very sleepy.  The fever and chills lasted a bit over 2 days but unfortunately the pain  in my body had not gone away.  Currently (4/14/2021) I have pain in all my joints and my neck and back and I noticed a rash around my right knee. I have felt very tired. I have felt some mild shortness of breath, which may be seasonal allergies (discussed with a nurse earlier, my oxygen levels are 98 percent today, so I am breathing fine, but there is a sensation of shortness of breath) . I have consulted my primary care office about the above and they are speaking to the doctor.  I am trying to limit my exposure to any hospital setting until the 14 days (2 weeks) is up from the vaccine.  Hopefully these symptoms will go away soon and hopefully none are related to a blood clot issue.  We&#39;ll see if my doctor or you guys may recommend a future platelet test?

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received my dose at 3pm on March 12, and experienced no adverse events until about 5 or 6 hours later. Between 8pm and 9pm, I felt a bit tired, though wasn?t sure it was vaccine-related at first. However, I shortly afterwards started feeling much more tired, and experienced chills and shivering. I went to sleep. My wife later said I felt very warm, though we did not measure my temperature.  During the night, at one point, I got up to go to the bathroom, and became very dizzy and nearly fell over, though I was able to catch myself and did not experience any fall or injury.   I went back to bed. At some other point during the night, I started sweating. My wife later said I felt cold at that point.  For most of the following day, Saturday, March 13, I no longer felt dizzy nor overly hot or cold, but had a migraine and mild nausea. I did not vomit, but I also ate very little during the day. I did eat a little in the morning, and had some water throughout the day. For the most part, I laid in bed, drifting in and out of sleep.   At about 7pm on March 13, I took two Tylenol to try to fight the headache. By 8pm I felt almost completely better. I ate more bits of food, and have felt fine since then. Sunday, I woke up and felt back to normal. I ate normally as well.

This was extremely itchy, spread to the front torso, the upper legs , and the abdomen. The arms and face were not affected. This lasted almost 24 hours . Benadryl and hydrocortisone cream 1% were utilized. The patient also experienced some loss of appetite the first three days post vaccine.  The dates for this were March 18-19. By the 24 hour mark, the rash was clearing.

                                                Seven days after vaccine was administered Patient started having symptoms of difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, and breaking out in a rash all over  his torso and upper arms.  His lips also got quite swollen.  The rash eventually spread down both his legs.  He was taken to the emergency room at Hospital, as he was visiting there at the time.  He was given benadryl, and prednisone once his Covid test came back negative.  Blood work, chest x-ray, CT scan of both stomach and chest, EKG and blood work all came back normal.  His resting heart rate was 120 and above, and he required two liters of oxygen to stay in the mid 90&#39;s saturation level.  He spent five days in the hospital before the rash was mostly faded on his torso and his lip swelling had come down.  He was discharged on 3/24/21 with the advice to see his primary care physician, and to be monitored carefully for oxygen saturation and heart rate.  The family could not think of anything he had eaten or come in contact with that would have caused any reaction.  At this time we think it was a reaction to his Janssen vaccine based on all the tests at the hospital coming back normal.

                                                The evening after the shot, I felt common side effects like headache, lack of energy, weakness, fever, chills, body aches, and inflammation. But my skin was also very sensitive to the touch. Upon 100% recovery from the common side effects on Monday, April 19, my skin sensitivity went away but was replaced with intense itchiness that has continued and gotten more intense since then to this day (Wed.). I am developing a few small welts on hands and feet. So far, my symptoms are very mild and not alarming, but are noticeable and bothersome. I do hope they will go away soon. I thought you should know about the skin issue since I have not seen it reported anywhere this far after the shot.

                                                The night of the 9th, I had injection site pain. That lasted for three days, at least. Significant pain but it didn&#39;t stop  me from work. It wasn&#39;t consistent pain - I was having trouble getting my arm up. Thursday, - 18th - I suddenly felt tired and feverish. I did a PCR test on the evening of the 18th. Then there was fever between 98.9 - 100.4. I had cough and sore throat and I had runny nose. The fever kind of subsided after I took Tylenol on the 18th and then again 19th and 20th, as well. My COVID result was negative. I made an emergency report on the 19th with my doctor. I had a virtual appt with her. She was under the opinion that it was a bacterial infection or allergic reaction. When I took - Levocedrizine - my runny nose symptoms got a little better. On 19th, she prescribed me Erythromycin - I took the full course. of that and my fever left the Sunday after I started that. I finished the full course of it by Tuesday. I still had a cough but I did not have any other symptoms after the course of medication (five days- I took two the first day and then one of the next four days after that) was finished. Note: I use CPAP at night. My cough took some time to subside - it probably subsided by the 26th.

Quickly spread and appeared nearly symmetrically as itchy raised red patches, moving  on both arms (shoulder/bicep) and legs (inner thigh).  Individual areas quickly resolved as it spread further down the limb until reaching the hand/foot and disappearing leaving no trace.  Experienced three (3) flareups starting in similar areas of the hand/foot, arms/legs, with each recurrence pushing further up the limb/body until stopping around the abdomen/back/neck.  Largely ceased after about 48 hours, but still observing occasionally on sides of feet/ankles days later.

At 12:07pm first responder 911 came and took over. Patient was hooked up to EKG and found some arrhythmia and was advised to go to the hospital to further evaluate. Patient agreed and was taken to the nearest hospital at about 12:20pm. Action taken: Charge nurse called 911 for help and hooked up patient with pulse oximetry and assessed patient for any sign and symptoms of any allergic reactions to Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. Administering RN and observation nurse continuously monitored patient?s B/P, Pulse, Pulse oximetry, and LOC until first responder paramedics came.

Went to ER for evaluation, CT scan with contrast. CT confirmed lump was swelling of lymphoid. ER thought maybe shingles, but it crosses over slightly over to the right with lesions.They determined maybe a virus and follow up with a dermatologist.  4/4/21 lesions now on left eye lid. ER visit again to ensure eye is ok, the ER dr. believes its shingles. 4/5/21 visit to dermatology and swab of lesions on face taken (still waiting on results). Dermatology believes some kind of herpes, but not sure. Went to Eye specialist to ensure eye does not have virus on same day. Eye dr believes shingles. Virus is not in the eye, but on left eyelid.

On day 11, it spread to all over body - legs, arms, stomach, back, and also started on the face by day 13.  The red spots were very itchy. VIsited my primary doctor who said that it could be the vaccine. Gave me steroids and  benadryl that relieved the itchiness, But when the effect of the meds faded, the itchiness was back. All red spots were yery itchy all over my body. They were not contagious as my children and wife did not get it. My wife got the same vaccine on the same day as me, but did not have a reaction as mine. . The red spots started growing in size and combining with other nearby spots on the legs. over day 12, and became brighter. They are fading now, but I still have the red spots all over my body.

THE VACCINE WAS GIVEN WITHOUT INCIDENT AND PATIENT SAID HE FELT OK. HE TRADED PLACES WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AND SAT IN A CHAIR IN THE EXAM ROOM. IT WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER I HAD ALREADY GIVEN HIS GIRLFRIEND HER VACCINE THAT HE SAID THAT HE WAS FEELING FUNNY. HIS COLORING CHANGED AND HE WAS DIAPHORETIC. I GOT A PAPERTOWEL WITH COOL WATER ON IT AND PLACED ON HIS NECK AND ANOTHER ONE FOR HIS FOREHEAD. AFTER A MINUTE OR SO, HE DID PASS OUT WHILE IN THE CHAIR. HE WAS OUT FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS AND THEN CAME BACK TO AND WAS ALERT AND ORIENTED X 4 BUT STILL FELT VERY WEAK. I GAVE HIM A WATER TO SIP ON. HIS GIRLFRIEND STAYED AT HIS SIDE THE WHOLE TIME. HIS O2 WAS 100% AND HIS PULSE 53. HE SAID THAT HE HAD EATEN SHORTLY BEFORE COMING TO GET HIS VACCINE BUT THEN LATER ASKED FOR AN APPLE BECAUSE HE WAS ON A CLEANSE DIET AND REALLY HAD NOT EATTEN MUCH. THE PCT WENT TO GET HIM AN APPLE. AFTER EATING THE APPLE AND SITTING FOR AN ADDITIONAL 20 MIN HE FELT WELL ENOUGH TO LEAVE. STILL WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AND HIS GIRLFRIEND COMMITTED TO DRIVING HIM SO HE DID NOT HAVE TO. HE LEFT WITH NO ASSISTANCE.

                                                The night of 3/23/21 at 5pm I had chills in my Brady and numbness and tingling in my toes. I looked at my toes and noticed they were turning very pale.  One minute later the bottoms of my feet started turning yellow and within one more minute the bottoms of my feet souls were completely yellow. I have never had this reaction before. It was shocking and looked like I had stepped in yellow paint.

                                                Within a few minutes of receiving the vaccination I lost consciousness. It was a drive-through vaccination clinic by the Health department. My vehicle rolled into a cement and metal bar/side of the building&#39;s exit at a slow speed. The EMS at the scene stated that my heartbeat was irregular, varying between bradycardia and tachycardia. When they checked my blood pressure inside the ambulance they stated it was very low. About 15-20 minutes later I tried to sit up and was still unstable and unable to keep myself upright without assistance. I was then taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital&#39;s emergency department. Nothing notable or unusual was found when I was checked out there. Within a couple hours I felt well enough to go home. Once home I had a headache, fatigue, mild dizziness, and nausea with physical activity. The following day I had a headache, muscle aches, pain at the injection site, and nausea with extended physical activity. Today I have pain in the arm where I received the vaccine and a mild headache.

He is not a citizen and cannot collect unemployment, so he is out on unpaid LOA. He attributed this injury to be caused by the immunizer injecting too high on the deltoid, and possible hitting the radial nerve. He went for an MRI which he had to pay out of pocket for and is awaiting results.

                                                I developed a very itchy rash on my back, hands, feet, arms and what felt like everywhere.  The just today stopped.  The rash lasted about 8-10 days I would say.  It got worse over the course of a week and then started getting better.   Someone suggested I take an anti-inflammatory, because my hands were swelling and it was difficult to work at the computer.  That seemed to help immediately or it could&#39;ve just started to go away on its own.  Regardless, I&#39;ve kept the twice daily naproxen for the past 4 days and things seem to be all better now.   My wife suggested I report my reaction.    The small red bumps were scattered mostly on my back, feet and hands.  They looked very similar to shingles but without the big red splotches only the small red bumps.  As they were forming they appeared to be sun blisters and then turned bright red.  Extremely itchy and kept me up scratching at night and scratching all day.

Some leg pain was noticed the 2nd or 3rd day. And I have experienced ear ringing randomly about a week and a half after vaccination. Those may or may not be related.  Also I feel it important to note in March of 2020 (before testing was available) I experienced a very similar set of symptoms: fever, chills, fatigue, multi-day headache, body ache, 6 weeks of slight cough, leg pain, and a day a few weeks after the coughing started where I had shortness of breath. I wasn&#39;t tested back then as it was not available. But based on the symptoms I experienced, I truly believe I had COVID-19 last year prior to vaccination.

                                                I have had headaches every day since I received the vaccination that last most of the day. There is a constant pressure in my head that moves around all areas, from the back base of the head, to the sides, temples, forehead/sinus regions. It is from waking until sleeping. Not incredibly intense, but constant. I have difficulty sleeping through the night and have not slept well since, either. I have also experience blurred vision. I have also experience bruising on various parts of my body including my arm, abdomen, and toe nails. My quality of life has suffered tremendously and I wish I hadn&#39;t gotten the vaccine.

IF I hadn&#39;t been working at home, I probably would have missed my Wednesday work day that first day.  I had at  Hospital Hemorrhoid Surgery (outpatient surgery) on the 22nd of April. My recovery had been going well for the first week or so but now I am having an issue with hard stools. I am taking liquids every  and I am having a bowel movement every day and I can&#39;t get them soft - they are all hard. I am taking  two stool softeners a day. and I&#39;m taking fiber. I am being impeded my recovery of my surgery - I&#39;m a week or two behind in recovery because of this.

                                                I got a very strange rash all over my back - went to urgent care - they gave me a steroid pill - still hasnt gone completely away - Ive also have had pains in my nerves in my left leg and up to my chest [ heart] tightness in my chest and tingling in my arms and legs. Still having those.  But about a week or so later went to urgent care for that and felt like i was going to faint.
