After awaking he doesn&#39;t remember the last 5 minutes. He laid down to go to sleep and was consistently hot and then cold. He does have a history of night terrors but they have remained dormant for about 2.5 years. Around 12 am he started having one of the worst night terrors I&#39;ve seen. The following morning, April 2nd 2021, he was feeling incredibly sore and the injection spot was tender. He said &#34;it feels like I got hit by a truck.&#34; Seems to be doing okay otherwise now.

                                                I began having general skin irritation on my back and chest all on the upper left of my torso. I developed a rash that began hurting, and believed I was having symptoms of shingles. I made a visit to my GP whom also believed it was a shingles infection and began antiviral treatment.

                                                Pt received the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. Pt started to feel numbness and tingling in his left hand (vaccinated arm) 15 minutes following the immunization. Pt stated that he felt fine other than his left hand experiencing numbness and tingling, specifically in his fingertips. Pt had no other adverse symptoms. I asked the pt to remain seated for an additional 15 minutes. He stated that he was ok but I convinced him to remain in his seat so we could continue to evaluate him. After a total of 45 minutes of evaluation, pt stated that the feeling of numbness and tingling was gone. Once again, I verified with the pt that he was feeling ok, with no additional adverse feeling or symptoms. Pt stated that he felt fine now and only felt a little soreness at the injection site.

                                                Muscle aches in armpits began a few hours after receiving the dose.  Within 8 hours of dose, a mild fever and chills began (around 100 degrees F). I attempted to take a bath to soothe aches but it did not help, and instead tried to go to sleep at 8:30 pm. A slight red rash appeared on chest and arms around this time.  I was woken up at 10:30 pm feeling disoriented and hot, with a fever of 104.5 degrees F. My wife noticed slurring of words and that I seemed unstable and confused, and symptoms were severe enough we considered going to the emergency room.  I experienced ringing in my ears and a severe headache.  I took 2 extra strength Tylenol, put a cold cloth on forehead, and drank fluids to fall back asleep.  Fever dropped to around 102 but continued throughout the night.  I woke up at 6:30 am and took two more Tylenol.  The severe headache continued and I vomited twice.  I attempted to take a shower and rinse off, and continue to rest.  Fever is reduced to 99 degrees F with help of Tylenol.

At 6:35, he said he had left arm weakness (arm he received vaccine in), fatigue, was dizzy, and felt &#34;off&#34;.  Patient did not lose consciousness and refused an ice pack.  BP checked at 6:38pm (170/98, pulse 105).  Patient stated his blood pressure usually runs high. I offered him an ice pack a second time, but he said there was no need and he felt better.  BP checked again 6:52pm (152/101, pulse 99).  I recommended that since his blood pressure is usually this high, he should follow up with his primary doctor regarding blood pressure as he may need some medication to assist in lowering it.  He said ok.  He left the pharmacy area at 7:02pm and said he was fine to leave, he did not want to remain any longer.

The fourth and fifth day my lips and face would become tingly/numb and my left arm would get weak and I would feel a little disoriented, my sleep has been pretty disturbed. It felt like I was having a stroke. I did not have a stroke,  I continue to occasionally feel the above symptoms, a little less potent than they were, they might be going away, I can&#39;t tell. I will be calling my doctor if it continues.

Slept until 11:15pm and woke up to violent shivering, pounding headache, full body aches, sore skin, achey joints, nausea, swelling tongue and throat. Took 1 dose of nyquil and then tossed and turned all night, very little sleep, symptoms persisted into the next day, but shivering stopped in the night. By morning (3-14) registered a fever of 100.3 which persisted most of the day along with remaining lessening symptoms. By evening I was still very sore, bad headache, and very lethargic/fatigued. Next morning (3-15) low temp of 97.1 degrees, headache, fatigue, lightheaded. Still feel headachy and tired.

I felt normal until Wednesday (March 24, 2021) afternoon where the same symptoms returned but were more pronounced (i.e. worse headache).

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the injection, I became dizzy and lightheaded. My  eyesight became blurry and my hearing very &#34;tinny&#34;. I felt nausea and  thought I was going to throw up. I sat down in a chair and was given a granola bar and some water. After about 3 or 4 minutes the majority of these  seemed to fade, but I still felt slightly &#34;off&#34;. Approximately 9pm that evening I felt very fatigued, so I went to bed. At approximately midnight, I woke up shivering, extremely cold, and sweating. Around 2am I had a fever of 102.3. I took some Tylenol to try to bring my fever down, which seemed to help. Around 9am the next morning my fever was gone, though I still felt extremely fatigued.  Later that evening, after several naps, I started to feel a little better. Most of these adverse events were resolved by 28 hours after injection. I had arm soreness at the injection sight that felt like having been punched in the arm for about a week after the injection.

                                                After receiving my Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine I experienced a lack of motor function in my throat. Approximately 40 minutes after having received the shot, I lost the ability swallow. A tingling sensation took the back of my throat and eventually felt as though it moved into my head. The whole experience lasted a couple of minutes. Since that time all other symptoms have been normal, sore, slight fever, etc.

I went to check on him and he was yellowish in color and barely able to speak to me. I asked another pharmacist to get me a cold pack and water. By the time we got the cold pack and water, he was not speaking, but eyes were open. I called 911 and the other pharmacist fanned him and placed the cold pack on his head and neck. He started talking within minutes and we waited for ambulance to come just to check him out. He was ablet to verify his name and where he was and EMSA came at 3:50pm. He left to their truck and said he was okay just felt shaky and clammy, but he could hear everyone talking to him.

                                                I sat down for 15 min and felt fine for the rest of the day. The hives started about 30 mins after I had dinner. It started on my shoulders and back, so I took a Benadryl, which was expired. So, I went to get some more and took a second dose around midnight. I won&#39;t up with none, but they were back around noon. That happened for a few days with it happening around lunch and dinner. On Tues, they started spreading more, so I went to the doctor. There was no swelling of the tongue. They lessened over the next couple of days. As of today, I have a small amount of itching, but nothing bad. I&#39;ve also been taking Claritin since yesterday. I have not seen any the same size as before, but I notice that they seem to be worse at night. I took my BP a few times and it was high at those times, but it went back to normal the next day. I will be seeing an allergist in the near future.

Around 1700, fatigue returned. Took a 3 mile walk between 1700-1800. Consumed two beers @ 7% ABV between 1800-1845. Around 1830 began feeling tingling, chills and muscle and joint pain which continues. The pain is similar to DOMS that occurs after a robust workout; did not have a robust workout today. I&#39;m fully functional, able to eat and able to otherwise function, so the symptoms are manageable.

About 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, he said he had pins and needle feeling on his left arm from his elbow to his ring and pinky fingers.   He also had a &#34;warm feeling&#34; at the same area.  We recommended him staying longer for observation.  After about 10-15 minutes he wanted to leave.  He now describe it similar to &#34;numbness on your foot when you sit on it too long&#34;.   He said he would be okay and he left.

I fell asleep and woke up at about 3 AM with incredibly itchy skin from the tops of my feet all the way up to my shoulders. It was so itchy and uncomfortable that it woke me up. I took 2 Benadryl and put some anti-itch lotion on, and was able to fall asleep. I woke up the next morning feeling groggy, but better. The itch has not returned at all in the week since this happened.

                                                Violent chills happened while working on computer. Laid on heat pad to assist in bed. Chills lasted about 20 minutes. Parasthesia happened immediately. Myalgia in legs happened immediately. No fever at this time.  Woke in morning with no fever, but muscle aches, malaise, lethargy, parasthesia were all present. Spent entire day in bed napping occasionally.  Measured temperature in evening at 100.7F.  Painful stomach pain happened in evening. Patient never gets acid pain or similar so this was very abnormal. Antacid helped but stomach pain continued all evening at a lesser degree.  When going to bed most symptoms had subsided. Still some parasthesia and Myalgia. Woke up on 4/9 feeling much better after lots of sleep.  No fever or other symptoms on morning of 4/9.

Then progressed to severe shaking chills, fevers, headaches, tingling/electric shock feeling in back of head/neck, muscle aches, mild joint pain, eye discomfort associated with the headaches, poor appetite at first, trouble sleeping, and fatigue; all of which required doses of Tylenol and ibuprofen and cold packs. Symptoms lasted all night and fever broke overnight after finally falling asleep. The next day (3/17) took some more Tylenol and ibuprofen, but the fever and chills subsided. The other symptoms mostly resolved except was still quite tired and felt weak. Also, had cold sweats all day on 3/17. By around 3/18 most all of the symptoms resolved.  Also, had mild soreness at vaccination site throughout.  I?m a physician. If I wasn?t a physician I may have sought medical attention.

                                                Seven days after vaccine was administered Patient started having symptoms of difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, and breaking out in a rash all over  his torso and upper arms.  His lips also got quite swollen.  The rash eventually spread down both his legs.  He was taken to the emergency room at Hospital, as he was visiting there at the time.  He was given benadryl, and prednisone once his Covid test came back negative.  Blood work, chest x-ray, CT scan of both stomach and chest, EKG and blood work all came back normal.  His resting heart rate was 120 and above, and he required two liters of oxygen to stay in the mid 90&#39;s saturation level.  He spent five days in the hospital before the rash was mostly faded on his torso and his lip swelling had come down.  He was discharged on 3/24/21 with the advice to see his primary care physician, and to be monitored carefully for oxygen saturation and heart rate.  The family could not think of anything he had eaten or come in contact with that would have caused any reaction.  At this time we think it was a reaction to his Janssen vaccine based on all the tests at the hospital coming back normal.

THE VACCINE WAS GIVEN WITHOUT INCIDENT AND PATIENT SAID HE FELT OK. HE TRADED PLACES WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AND SAT IN A CHAIR IN THE EXAM ROOM. IT WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER I HAD ALREADY GIVEN HIS GIRLFRIEND HER VACCINE THAT HE SAID THAT HE WAS FEELING FUNNY. HIS COLORING CHANGED AND HE WAS DIAPHORETIC. I GOT A PAPERTOWEL WITH COOL WATER ON IT AND PLACED ON HIS NECK AND ANOTHER ONE FOR HIS FOREHEAD. AFTER A MINUTE OR SO, HE DID PASS OUT WHILE IN THE CHAIR. HE WAS OUT FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS AND THEN CAME BACK TO AND WAS ALERT AND ORIENTED X 4 BUT STILL FELT VERY WEAK. I GAVE HIM A WATER TO SIP ON. HIS GIRLFRIEND STAYED AT HIS SIDE THE WHOLE TIME. HIS O2 WAS 100% AND HIS PULSE 53. HE SAID THAT HE HAD EATEN SHORTLY BEFORE COMING TO GET HIS VACCINE BUT THEN LATER ASKED FOR AN APPLE BECAUSE HE WAS ON A CLEANSE DIET AND REALLY HAD NOT EATTEN MUCH. THE PCT WENT TO GET HIM AN APPLE. AFTER EATING THE APPLE AND SITTING FOR AN ADDITIONAL 20 MIN HE FELT WELL ENOUGH TO LEAVE. STILL WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AND HIS GIRLFRIEND COMMITTED TO DRIVING HIM SO HE DID NOT HAVE TO. HE LEFT WITH NO ASSISTANCE.

It was shocking and looked like I had stepped in yellow paint.
