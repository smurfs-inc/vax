                                                Patient received Janssen vaccine around 10:30. He left the observation room feeling fine. once he got at his car and started to drive, he felt shortness of breath and some weakness. Then, he came back to the SR Vaccine site to get help around 10:50. We met him in front of the parking lot, he was having some trouble of breath and weakness. We put him in a wheelchair, brought him back to the Observation area. I asked him to lay down with elevated legs on a chair. He instantly felt better, no more shortness of breath. He did not need to use any Oxygen supply. Also, he drank some water, sit back in the chair and felt better ready to leave with his brother who came to help him just in case. At 11:10 he left the building with orientations about worsening of symptoms and when to call EMS.

                                                Got injected, didn?t hurt much. Was told to wait 15 minutes in case of reaction. They walked away and left me sitting in a chair in a public space with everyone else who was waiting. I texted my wife to check in, when I started tearing up and crying for no real reason, then started feeling nauseous so I closed my eyes.   Suddenly I felt like I had been given a shot of adrenaline out of nowhere so I?m just trying to figure out if it?s nerves or a physiological response to something. I?m trying to control my breathing but having a hard time breathing.   Then the fever hit. The most intense flash of heat. I was hyperventilating. I couldn?t open my eyes or move or make a sound, I could just sit there struggling to breathe. My phone was in my hand and I couldn?t lift it. I just simply didn?t have the strength or energy to move.   At some point I legit thought I was about to die. I managed to angle my wrist so I could check my heart rate with my watch. It was 47bpm.   I was fading away but I made myself get control of my breathing and forced myself to take long deep slow breaths. It hurt, and I felt like passing out, but I kept doing it.   Fever turned into chills and then I soaked through my jeans and T-shirt in under a minute. I was finally thinking clearly and breathing and getting oxygen. Everyone else near me was fine.   Nobody checked on me the entire time including the 3 people who sat there and watched me suffer through this.  I told the pharmacist about my reaction and asked if it was normal and didn?t receive any indication that I should be concerned, so I went home since I felt better.   It wasn?t until my friend pointed out that this sounds like anaphylaxis that I thought I should report it. So here I am. Hopefully I?ll be okay.

About 5-10 minutes after vaccination, patient passed out (fainted) while sitting down in a chair.  Moved patient on to floor lying down flat and observed him for a few seconds. Patient was un responsive and appeared to struggle to breath. Asked my staff to call 911 for emergency services, and to bring an Epipen  just in case, and started to perform CPR on the patient. The patient gained consciousness in about 15 chest compassions and became responsive. He answered the questions like  his name, where he lives etc. As the patient became conscious,  responsive and appeared to breath normally, I did NOT administer Epipen.  Kept patient in observation and kept him engaged in talking until EMS personnel have arrived. They checked his vitals and blood glucose. In the conversation with   EMS personnel, they said he is hypertensive and hyperglycemic.  Ems took him to the ambulance by walking him (stretcher wasn&#39;t necessary)

My PCP told me that I should wait it out that it was probably my body revolving against the vaccine and I was prescribed a medication for my headache and vertigo. My ear were also checked with an ENT and I have no inner ear problems. I can say that my symptoms came from the J&amp;J vaccine.

                                                April 17th, felt chest pain and fatigue and shortness of breath. After about two weeks of it, I went to ER on the 26th. I was diagnosed with blood clot on my heart.  I spent a week at the hospital Heparin blood thinners and antibiotics  - discharged on May 2, 2021. They sent me home with Warfarin regiment. I am still on that.  I still have some days where I&#39;m good but some days, I can barely stand and get out of bed due to short of breath, fatigue but not as much chest pain. I think the blood thinners are working. I just have to take it easy and make sure to have some calm days.  It  could take weeks to months to have the blood clot totally dissolve from the system.

Patient states that he has been experiencing dyspnea and shortness of breath both upon exertion (and, even upon minimal exertion ? for example, when walking from car in parking lot into the pharmacy today) and also while at rest.  Patient states that he has no known history of dyspnea or shortness of breath similar to the symptoms he is currently experiencing. After contacting the patient?s primary care physician?s office and discussing the signs and symptoms the patient was experiencing with the medical office personnel, the patient was advised by the pharmacist to seek immediate medical attention and report to the nearest hospital emergency department. The patient stated that he would seek immediate medical attention at the local hospital emergency department, as his primary care physician did not have any appointment availability to be able to see him in office today.

I have been checking in with that website (V-safe App)  you gave me no one has contacted me. Monday (5/3/21) I missed work due to me not feeling good and still today (5/5/21) I&#39;m at work but feel like I could fall asleep, no energy, nausea still, and like I haven&#39;t slept in weeks even though I get good sleep. My breathing has gotten to the point that it hurts to take a deep breath. I believe this is all due to the shot but didn&#39;t know what you thought.&#34;

Then on the 6th day, I suddenly broke out in hives, starting with a reaction at the injection site on my right deltoid. The hives continued to progress and get worse over the next few days and started welting. My legs and arms were covered in hives. I became dyspneic which was relieved by using albuterol. Hives reduced from antihistamines. For three days the hives would appear systemically with skin sensations of burning and itching.

Vaccinator was notified that he has a history of vasovagal response with needles. This response presents itself as sweating (and possible fainting) and is alleviated by lying down. Client mentioned that previous nurse advised him to smell an alcohol pad to distract and prevent a vasovagal response, as this had worked previously on a glucose check. No medications were disclosed or history of anaphylaxis reported. With this background information, RN offered to have vaccine administered in reclined position, however client refused. RN conferred with co-lead about administration recommendations. Vaccinator then checked in with patient at 1423 to see if patient was okay and patient did not answer the question. RN then felt the client&#39;s hand and noticed hand was clammy. At 1425 the reclining chair was brought to the station and patient was transferred into chair, appearing diaphoretic. RN palpated pulse and noted patient was not tachycardia, but RN did note tachypnea and uneasiness. RN then provided distraction and promoted relaxation. Then at 1426 patient reported feeling okay and RN noted patient no longer felt clammy. At 1440 patient was asked if he would prefer if EMS should be called, patient declined and stated that he was able to drive home. Then at 1447 patient left the site appearing well, alert and oriented x3 leaving by self in private car.

                                                First 2 days after vaccine I had the expected slight sore arm, some minor headache, some muscle aches. Nothing major that kept me from working or sleeping. Some time after, maybe 3rd or 4th day, I noticed a shortness of breath. This I did not expect since it&#39;s not a listed side effect for the vaccine but it is one for Covid. I notice it everyday while sitting/working. It does not keep me from being active (running/yard work) but I notice I&#39;m not 100% healthy feeling. It feels like  the shortness of breath is closer to the top of the chest/throat area if that makes any sense. If I breathe deeply it feels like I may want to cough although I don&#39;t usually cough from doing so. It&#39;s mostly just a constant feeling of a very slight shortness of breath.

Lower leg below the knee on the left and right leg varicose veins have constantly burned and ached. Only my right leg had previous varicose veins that would burn ache in the evenings following a day of manual labor. From Friday morning to Monday late night my left temple would randomly throb. Same days either my lower left or right lung would ache or be sore. For about 2 hours everyday same days above I would have a metallic taste in my mouth no matter what I ate or drank. No pain ever severe enough for immediate medical attention

                                                Was having normal side effects including headache, fever, muscle aches which started about 6 hours after injections.  Roughly 14-16 hours after the injection (8:30-9am) started getting chest pain and slight shortness of breath.  Called my PCP and they told me to go to the ER as the chest pain is not normal.   At the ER they did an EKG which came back abnormal and I was rushed into a procedure to check my heart including a catheter, ultrasound, and a few more I will provide below.  Outcome after all the test was inflammation which I asked if it could have been in other areas of my body but doctor said it was my chest.  My C-Reactive Protein level was double the normal level.  They put me on 3 medications, Ibuprofen, one for Gout and Prilosec.

Three days later around 6:25 am on April 15, 2020: I got out of bed, next moment I recall is of me on the floor. No memory of falling. I was shaking uncontrollably as if my body was getting many commands at the same time but I had no control over it. I could not call out for help. At one point I was biting my right  hand but could not make myself stop until my shaking stopped. Bite did not penetrate skin but I had visible bite mark on my hand.  I regained control suddenly and just got up slowly and shaken by the experience. Wife then drove me to the ER.  Been feeling pressure on my head.

                                                Woke up the next morning feeling sore at shot site and as the day progressed my body started to ache all over.  For the next 2 days after this, I will alternate between having the chills and having intense sweats.  On Friday 06/25/2021, I woke up to my chest hurting , I could not catch my breath, it felt like I had a very heavy weight on my chest .  I went to the emergency room which is a part of the Hospital.  After the initial tests the  physician told me with 99% certainty that I had had a heart attack.  Soon after this they rushed me by ambulance from hospital to hospital which is about 20 miles or so.  They rushed me in and completed an arteriogram within minutes of arriving at the hospital.  They confirmed with this test that is was not a heart attack and after several more test, the doctor that I had developed Myocarditis due to the vaccine shot.  The admitted me into the hospital on 06/25/2021 for observation and to run more test until I was stable enough to go home.  I stayed in the hospital for 1 evening and was discharged on 06/26/2021 at about 1:00 or 2:00 that afternoon.  The doctor prescribed several medications for me to take for my heart for the next foreseeable future.  On 06/30/2021 I had a visit to my new cardiologist in which he ran several test and stating that I was looking better, but he had ordered an MRI to take place on 07/06/2021 at Hospital.  I have a follow up visit for my cardiologist slated for 07/19/2021 in which I will find out more information.

                                                Within hours I quickly became extremely sore, fatigued, and had difficulty breathing. I was unable to eat  until the breathing issues subsided late afternoon Sunday since I felt as though I was choking when I  attempted to eat. The fatigue and body pain was pronounced enough for me to have to call off work  Monday, but they gradually diminished. I am submitting this on 3/11, and I am still experiencing some  body aches though the constant feeling of exhaustion is no longer present.

                                                I felt fine all day and went to bed at 9:30pm. I woke up to my body shaking uncontrollably and I was freezing at 10:30pm. My wife felt my skin and she said I was burning up. Unfortunately our thermometer wasn&#39;t working so I don&#39;t know my temperature, but I have never in my life shaken so badly with a fever. I couldn&#39;t control myself and I was shaking so hard that my muscles were sore from it, but I still couldn&#39;t stop. I then began vomiting every 45 minutes or so. This happened for nearly 4 hours until 2:18am. Then very suddenly everything just stopped. No more feeling cold (actually I then felt very warm and couldn&#39;t cool off. I was sweating quite a bit). No more shaking. No more vomiting. I did get a wicked headache, but I figured it was due to dehydration and took two Advil. The Advil didn&#39;t do anything and I was awake until 5:59am because my head hurt too badly to sleep. Finally I slept for about 4.5 hours. Then I just felt worn out for most of the day on the 10th, and couldn&#39;t shake the headache. Then on the evening if the 10th, I started getting a sore throat and a slightly runny nose. I went to bed that way. When I woke up on the 11th (today) I still had the sore throat and slight runny nose. The headache was gone, but I felt tightness in my chest. As I went throughout the day, I&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;m short of breath with doing most things. I have two young children, so even taking care of them I feel like at times I&#39;m struggling for breath. I&#39;m not in bad shape and am a runner, so my cardio isn&#39;t bad. So I was surprised by this.

                                                Got COVID (Janssen) vaccine shot on April 6th at noon.  Felt fine Tuesday and went to bed as normal.  Woke up April 7th at 7AM with sharp pains in my left shoulder (same side as shot) and slight shortness of breath, and slight chest pain in the left quadrant of my torso (same side as shot).  Proceeded to take Advil and seemed to help a bit.  Minor aches/pains and shortness of breath throughout the day until about 8PM.  At this time shoulder chest pain became more severe, and breathing became very strained, short, and painful.  Pain and breathing kept getting worse and at midnight on Wednesday night thought I was having a heart attack due to extreme chest pain, couldn&#39;t breath, lightheaded, dizzy, tingly extremities.  My wife drove me to ER at 12:30 AM Thursday.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: Unknown) frequency 1 total, dose was not reported, administered to left arm on 06-APR-2021 at 12 noon for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 6-APR-2021 at 12 noon, patient got vaccinated and was fine that day . Next morning on 07-APR-2021,  patient woke up with sever cramping in same shoulder which he got the shot in, most pain was in the upper left quarter of his torso to down half way to chest up to the shoulder till the neck . By the end of the day it  spread to his whole chest and upper body. Also he had shortness of breath ,could not breath .The cramping and shortness of breath came at same time. He took Advil and went along with his day . He took 3 tablet of Advil 200mg  every 4-5 hours all day ( total of 3 dose that day) . By night time the case was progressively worse as the whole chest had a lot of pain . He thought that he had heart attack . He thought that he was about to  pass out . He could not stand on his own . So his wife took him to emergency room at mid night at 12:30 am on 08-APR-2021. He stayed there for 5 hours and they did  bunch of tests , EKG which rolled out the heart attack .They did  Chest X-ray which found things then did D-dimer which its level was very high . They found  bunch of clots in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides. They did ultra sound on the legs  which had no evidence of blood clots . They discharged him  from the emergency room as  they felt that he was ok to be out . After couple of hours after discharge , patient&#39;s health care professional wrote for him Eliquis, antibiotic and pain reliver. He was given antibiotic because he had  beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed) . It was found air sacs in lung with signs of pneumonia in both lobes . He came home and started to  monitor his blood oxygen . He stayed in the  same position till recovery . He was better each day since last week but still had sinus and cramping in the chest ( very minor but was still there). The lung capacity was very limited to take some steps. Patient stated that he needed a specialist to understand his condition. He had no medical history before that incidence . He was wondering regarding which type of blood thinner was good for this type of blood clots because he read that the regular blood thinners are not good for that type of blood clot which his HCP gave (regular blood thinner). Laboratory data included: Total lung capacity decreased (NR: not provided) lung capacity is very limited. On 08-APR-2021, Laboratory data included: Chest X-ray (NR: not provided) found things, EKG (NR: not provided) rolled out heart attack, Fibrin D dimer (NR: not provided) level was very high, and Ultrasound scan (NR: not provided) no evidence of blood clots.  Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included: apixaban, and ibuprofen. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of the severe cramping in left shoulder and upper body, chest pain (whole chest had lot of pain)/thought that he had heart attack, shortness of breath/could not breath, thought that he was about to pass out, difficulty in standing, bunch of clots in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides, beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed), cramping in chest and sinus was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments:  This 44-year-old male patient reported blood clots of both lungs 2 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  The patient denies any medical history/condition prior to vaccination.  The symptoms reported were severe cramping of arm that spread to his whole chest and upper body and shortness of breath; the patient thought he had a heart attack, about to pass out and could not stand because of the progression of pain.  EKG done at the emergency room ruled out heat attack, D-Dimer was reported to be very high, clots were found in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides, x-ray showed beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed).  The patient was prescribed with Eliquis, an unspecified antibiotic and pain reliever.  Outcome of the events were not reported.   Based on the information that is available, the event is assessed as plausible with the causal association to immunization, per WHO causality classification of adverse events following immunization based on a lack of a definitive plausible biological mechanism.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

Symptoms lasted approx 5 days, and dropped off in severity. Other symptoms included the following the day of the 04/6 -4/10/21:  - dizziness - metal taste in my mouth - nausea - mental confusion - fatigue - loss of appetite - severe shakes/chills/sweats

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after receiving the vaccination, my throat became dry and my eyes began watering. It was hard to tell but my throat felt slightly swollen also. I drank some water and a few minutes later things seemed to clear up. Randomly throughout the afternoon I had similar dry/itchy/tingling in my throat but not as strong as the time right after the vaccination. I didn&#39;t suspect this was directly related to the virus since I have allergies to grasses, trees, pollen, etc. and take over the counter allergy medicine as needed.  At 3:30am today (4/10/21) I woke up having to use the restroom and when standing up out of bed I was extremely dizzy. After laying down in bed the dizziness disappeared. When waking up later in the morning the dizziness/light headed feeling was still present when standing. I also have noticed random strange pinching pain in my legs that only last for 1-2 seconds and sends a quick short pain sensation throughout my body.    I have no clue if any of this is related to the vaccination received, but after noticing news articles with issues in a few folks receiving the Janssen vaccine, I decided I would pass this info along just in case.

I was bedridden for 36 hours and then the symptoms gradually subsided by day 3.  I then developed a sense of chest tightness intermittently for the next 4 days usually at night.

                                                On March 13, I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine at the  clinic  The pharmacist monitored me for symptoms but there were none right away. I did have a fever and some body aches in the two or three days that followed but those were short-lived.  While driving on March 16, I started experiencing some irregular breathing and periods of shortness of breath about three hours after leaving home. I stopped at the emergency room at the Health Center where Dr diagnosed me with an acute pulmonary embolism after discovering a small blood clot in one of my lungs. He prescribed me with Eliquis, which I am still taking today. Their phone number is provided if you have questions.  I haven&#39;t had too many shortness of breath episodes lately but do not know if the blood clot is still there. I am scheduled to see my hematologist on April 27 to get further updates on this. My hematologist Dr is located in clinic number provided While it has not yet been proven that the vaccine caused the blood clot in my lung, I feel the need to report this in the wake of recent news about the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. My hematologist and primary care physician are both aware that I have received the vaccine but I have not received any further communication from them.

                                                Patient was doing paperwork when he experienced the worst headache of his life on 4/17 with associated emesis. Patient found to have a Hunt Hess 3 Fisher Grade 3 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage with hydrocephalus s/p EVD,  s/p cerebral angiogram on 4/18 negative for aneurysm/AVM. On the evening of 4/20, patient became acutely hypoxic with wheezing for which he required oxygen via 10L oxymask. During 4/21, his oxygen requirements continued to increase with increased work of breathing requiring high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) at 50L/60%  &#43; pulmonary congestion on imaging and he was treated with diuresis. On 4/22, oxygen needs increased requiring 70L/100% with worsening imaging. He was then started on steroids, antibiotics were broadened, epoprostenal started in addition to diuresis. On 4/23, patient reports improved breathing and is on non-rebreather. Antibiotics, steroids, and epoprostenal were discontinued as patient showed improvement of oxygenation without clear signs of infection. Of note,  patient reports vaping in the past 2-3 months.  Patient has also been intermittently febrile. Wife was concerned that these symptoms were possibly related to him getting the J&amp;J vaccine on 4/11. Patient is currently still in hospital on day 6 of admission at this time.

                                                Ten days after vaccination I had an allergic shellfish reaction to a frozen lobster product.  Never happened before and I&#39;ve had other Lobster on the east coast before.  I also ate shrimp a few days prior to vaccination with no reaction.  I have eaten other Lobster all my life with no reaction.    My sinuses and throat closed up making it very difficult to breathe.   I didn&#39;t know what was happening so I took decongestants and antihistamines then went to the doctor and got injected with a steroid immune suppressor.  I now have epinephrine just in case it happens again.

He was found to have a left leg DVT and bilateral pulmonary emboli. He was started on a heparin drip which he tolerated well. He was transitioned from heparin to Eliquis. He has no family or personal history nor other risk factors for DVT or PE; no long travel, no surgery, no immobilization. Hypercoag workup was initiated. He continued to have right sided pleuritic chest pain which improved during his stay. There was some question of possible community-acquired pneumonia, which he was empirically treated with CTX and azithromycin. He had normal WBC, low procalcitonin, and no fever. Patient was discharged home on 6/15/21 on Eliquis with follow up scheduled with primary care provider.

It persisted the rest of the day and all day Tuesday.  I also felt soreness of limbs (both arms and legs) intermittently for the 48 hours.  I had shortness of breath for the next day.  I felt extreme fatigue for the next 48 hours.  I felt my heart racing off and on for 24 hours,  I felt a loss of strength in both arms and legs for the next 48 hours.  Monday Night I woke up sweating as I had a fever.  The fever persisted off and on for about 24 hours. I was irritable (probably due to not feeling well) for about 48 hours.  My wife had to drive me home.

He developed 3 serous filled bulla with the largest measuring  5cm by 2.5cm with surrounding erythema and tenderness to palpation in the area.  This was associated with headache, diaphoresis, shortness of breath, substernal chest discomfort, and sensation of throat itching. By 72 hours the bulla had popped and the patient&#39;s the only remaining symptom was right upper arm pain.

                                                Since receiving the vaccine, I have developed tightness in my chest and shortness of breath.  At times, it has been severe.  Feeling like I might pass out, I went to Immediate Care on 04/12.  They didn?t identify a cause.  On 04/15, I went to my Doctor, who noted wheezing in my upper lungs.  An inhaler and pantoprazole were prescribed.  At times, it feels like I am having something similar to an asthma attack.  The inhaler has helped.  Prior to the vaccine, I didn?t have any history of breathing problems, nor does it run in my family.

The following Monday, I woke up with sharp pains across my chest and shortness of breath. I was admitted to the hospital Emergency Room for about 7 hours and subsequently diagnosed with pericarditis. It is unknown if the pericarditis was associated to the vaccine but thought it was a good idea to document here.

About a week later, I started coughing a lot. My head hurt,but i didn&#39;t run any fever. I thought I was having bad allergies from changing weather, but it lasted longer than usual, over a week. I was sore, tired, not really hungry. I feel better now, but I still have this lingering dry cough and it won&#39;t completely go away. I still feel sore and very tired. I get a headache every now and then. I thought it was allergies, but it falls into the time period that people are having reactions to this JJ Janssen shot. The cough is annoying. I get short breathed and winded rather easily or more easily now. I thought I&#39;d at least report it.

I fell asleep one hour into my arrival and slept for 17 hours. Up to and including today I am having headaches, pain in my legs on left side only, nausea, lack of sleep and a continued smell similar to dried blood after a injury. I have also have and continue to have shortness of breath and chest pains resulting in two panic attacks within the last three days. This has led me to report this and I have doctor visit scheduled for 4/22. I also reported today based on internet search of reactions.

                                                About 1 week after vaccination, I noted sensations of fullness or bloatedness.  It felt like gas trapped in my upper abdomen that could not be relieved by burping.  Within 2 days, I began to have pain in lower, left rib cage akin to side cramps/stitch after strenuous running, but persisted the entire day.  About 2-3 days later,  the pain intensified and spread throughout my diaphragm region (left and right sides).   Breathing was somewhat affected, after semi-strenuous activities, such as walking up/down stairs.  So, I avoided physical exercise, and took Advil for a couple days to minimize the pain.  After another 3-4 days, the pain in the diaphragm region subsided.  I have not experienced further discomfort for the past week (today is 4/21/2021).  No treatments were sought during this period.  I self-researched the symptoms and hypothesize the pain stemmed from a swollen spleen, which might have been caused by an overactive immune system due to the vaccine.

                                                Had a raspy throat and nasal itch almost like allergies but more. 2nd day it increased its severity. The third day I was really congested. I felt like my lungs were only filling up half way; I was a little shortness of breath. Mucous buildup and had to cough to clear my throat to breathe. I felt like there was swelling in my throat. By Thursday, I went to get seen by doctor. Dr. noticed little pustules on my lymph nodes and she tested me for strep, negative. QR, inhaler steroid, prednisone for 5 days. Nasal spray to clear the nasal passages, Flonase. I have taken albuterol when needed to help clear up my breathing. I&#39;m still feeling a little congested with sinus drainage, voice a little horse. Note: I did have a Tetanus shot about a month or a little bit more than a month before this vaccine.

Prior to that, I have been having some problems breathing after getting the vaccine and have been using my Ventolin  more often after the vaccine. Also noticed shortly after getting the vaccine, a feeling of liquid in my right ear.  the liquid in the ear did go away a day before the dizziness started.  Did not consider the ear or breathing issues as possible side effects  as I do have asthma and figured the ear was congestion. Not sure if the dizziness and the feeling of liquid in my right ear are related and/or related to the vaccine.

                                                I received the J&amp;J vaccine on 3/16/2021 and then flew to watch over my dads house while he went through cancer treatment. I began to have pain in my chest that was getting progressively worse, yesterday I had a very sharp pain when taking a shallow breath.  I went to the hospital they thought I had pneumonia, but then saw a blood clot in right upper side, I&#39;ve had a prior event but that was attached to an injury in 2012. I&#39;ve not had any other issues.

He came home and collapsed due to the fatigue which is not normal for him.   About 12 hours later his throat got scratchy, achy but doable.  He went to work and had to leave early due to flu-like symptoms, felt feverish.   Really bad aches now, and his breathing and heart rate are elevated right now.  Achy-like headaches.   He did take some Ibuprofen 800 mg and seems to be helping.  He has had the typical soreness of getting the vaccine in the left shoulder, but otherwise ok.  He also has a stuffy nose, scratchy throat and his eyes are a little red and glassy.    He was directly exposed to somebody for 25 hours that was positive for COVID, but nobody else in the car got COVID in January.

Went back to the er on 4/28 as pain was unbearable (chest pain)  once given a cat scan and diagnosed with blood clots in my lungs and then an ultra sound and found a blood clot in my leg (just above knee).  It is thought that I was mis-diagnosed on the original trip to the er with kidney stones.  I have been put on blood thinners and pain medication and will be following up with my doctor.

The patient&#39;s height and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included high blood pressure and diabetes.  The patient received COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S (suspension for injection, route of administration not reported, batch number 1802070, expiry date unknown), dose not reported, 1 total administered on 19-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination on left arm. Concomitant medications included amlodipine besilate for drug used for unknown indication, empagliflozin for drug used for unknown indication, fenofibrate for drug used for unknown indication, insulin aspart for drug used for unknown indication, insulin glargine for drug used for unknown indication, losartan for drug used for unknown indication, and pioglitazone hydrochloride for drug used for unknown indication. On an unspecified date (reported as 22-MAR-2021; 28 days prior to vaccination), the patient experienced shortness of breath, heart rate increased, runny nose, chills and was hospitalized (date unspecified). He reported that on this past Saturday, 17-APR-2021 (2 days prior to vaccination), he went to the emergency room. He reported that his toenails were coming off, the skin on his toes was coming off, and he had swelling in his right foot and up his leg. He says there was no circulation going to his toe and he was diagnosed with having a blood clot in his right leg. He says he had surgery to open up the arteries in his leg, and also reported gangrene in his toe. The subject was discharged on 21-APR-2021. On 23-APR-2021, the patient experienced feeling hot. He also reported that he may need to have his right pinky (fifth) toe amputated because it has gangrene. He reported that he is going to go back to the hospital, to which he would seek medical attention if he was having issues. Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included paracetamol. When called back due to his vaccination dates being after event start dates, the patient said that his memory is not too good, so he &#39;had to take his time to remember the correct dates&#39;. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S was not applicable. The patient was recovering from blood clot in leg, and had not recovered from runny nose, shortness of breath, heart rate increased, chills, feeling hot, gangrene in toe, right leg swollen, and right foot swollen. This report was serious (caused hospitalization).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 50-year-old  hypertensive and diabetic male patient reported that he was feeling hot and may need to have his fifth toe amputated because it has gangrene 4 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and 2 days after discharge form the hospital.  The patient was hospitalized for shortness of breath, heart rate increased, runny nose, and chills 28 days prior to vaccination.  The patient went to the emergency room 2 days prior to vaccination because his toenails/skin on his toes were coming off, swelling in his right foot and up his leg, gangrene in his toe; he reported that there was no circulation going to his toe and was diagnosed with having a blood clot in his right leg; the patient reported he had surgery to &#34;open up&#34; the arteries in his leg. Four days after vaccination, the patient felt hot and reported reported that he may need to have his right pinky (fifth) toe amputated because it has gangrene.  The patient is taking paracetamol as treatment.  No other details was reported.  Based on the lack of temporal association, the causality is considered not related for the events blood clot in leg, shortness of breath, heart rate increased, right leg swelling, right foot swelling, chills, and runny nose.  The information available regarding event gangrent of fifth toe and feeling hot precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

                                                Patient had arm tingling shortly after injection. Pt stayed in store for about 4 hours after 2pm injection, no redness or swelling noticed. Pt was quite anxious &amp; nervous (but already has severe anxiety). Pharmacist called patient following afternoon, the 11th and patient noted he was doing marginally better but still sounded anxious. Pharmacist called patient on Fri the 12th 5:16p and this was when the patient explained the following: Muscle stiffness on left side &amp; pain down left leg; cranial pain; shoulder stiffness; nasal congestion; some shortness of breath; soreness &amp; fatigue.  Patient called back and said he had partial shortness of breath at 7:34p on the 12th.  On Sat the 13th at 11am, pharmacist called to check on pt; found him quite agitated &amp; saying, &#34;He feels the shot was botched&#34;, noted he had called Janssen to report his issues.  At 4:30pm, pt came to pharmacy, looked fine, arm showed no redness, was more subdued in person than on the phone earlier. He said he was feeling better but was not happy with Janssen and wanted the Moderna 2 series shot because he feels Janssen&#39;s vaccine wasn&#39;t doing what it was supposed to.

                                                Exactly 11 days after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine my husband developed leg pain in his right lower inner leg, he was taken to the hospital on 04/20/2021 which a ultrasound was completed but resulted no blood clots, no other labs or treatment was performed that day, the next day he developed severe diarrhea and flu like symptoms with continued leg pain and difficulty breathing, He was then rushed to the hospital by ambulance where he was suffering from very low BP 41/31 was the lowest, a line was placed and he was put on pressors to increase his BP.  He was transferred to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a flesh eating bacteria in the right leg where the pain was at and Sepsis.  He was taken to surgery to debride the right leg and was started on CVVHD because his new kidney was now failing, he eventually was started back on Hemodialysis and taken to surgery 2 more times where he cardiac arrested on the table in surgery and died.  A private autopsy is being performed but the preliminary results shows he had multi-system organ failure, including his liver which was NEVER a problem in the past.

Had to lie on the ground to rest and catch breath.  Several minutes to catch breath and about 10 minutes for chest pain to resolve.   One month later had chest pain in center of chest... went to urgent care... EKG and vital signs showed normal. Two months after vaccine, started having forceful heart beat, lightheadedness, fatigue, pins/needles neuropathy in right foot... Lightheadedness and neuropathy was episodic, sometimes for hours, for a week... Fatigue was worse for a week then gradually eased but remains mild to moderate fluctuating... Forceful heart beat has continued but was worse 3 weeks ago and is always worse lying down and improves when sitting up though can be mildly present sitting up... and continues today. Seeing my primary care doctor to assess.   Went to clinic 3 times in last month for this... vitals always normal and one additional EKG normal.

                                                abdominal pain. The pain was so severe that my knees would buckle and several times if I was holding anything, it caused me to drop it. After about a week, I had an appointment at 4:30 and was scheduled for the next morning at 8:30 to meet with a back and spine doctor for xrays.  Xrays were negative.  I was then schedule with a neck and hand specialist a few days later. This appointment could not provide a diagnosis.  Back and abdominal pain increase and soreness had spread to the stomach and groin.  After the news broke of the cerebral blood clots in 6 women.  See attached Continuation Page.

Walking 10ft or up the stairs triggered my symptoms. Once I stopped moving, my symptoms would dissipate.   I called my PCP along with a cardiologist up until today.   I was tested for blood clots, had complete blood panel, stress test and nuclear stress test. My symptoms are getting better but still have mildly present.  My last meeting with the cardiologist, what he saw after the nuclear stress test, that there was a lack of blood flow where to the lower right heart chamber. He said it probably due to a blood blockage or plague and at this time he is trying to figure it out.

She found him sitting up with a clear liquid pouring out of his nose and then he fell over dead.

Patient reported that he received the Jannsen COVID-19 vaccine 3 weeks prior to admission and symptoms began 8 days later. On the morning of admission the patient also developed pressure-like and pleuritic chest pain.  EKG findings showed ST elevations in V5-V6 with depression in aVL.  D-dimer was found to be elevated however PE evaluation was negative.  Troponins were also found to be elevated. The patient was diagnosed with acute pericarditis and underwent left heart catheterization, selective coronary angiography and left ventriculography. The coronary angiography revealed no significant obstructive coronary artery disease, and left ventriculography revealed normal LV size and function.  Patient was subsequently initiated on colchicine therapy for acute pericarditis. He remains admitted at hospital.

                                                About 2 days after he received the vaccine he had really bad headaches, which he never gets.  They lasted for about 2 weeks off and on.  Around two or two in a half weeks later he started having adverse pain in his  middle back left side area.  Stated it was a sharp stabbing like pain then it started radiating from his back around his left side up into his chest left side.  Being concerned his doctor ordered a Cath test but everything was  normal. We have been to GI, Cardiologist, his regular doctor, pulumonary and ER and they have done blood work, CT Scans and x-rays and can&#39;t find out why my husband is still having severe sharp pains throughout.  They just keep telling him to try another type of doctor.  He stays in constant pain and states his chest hurts and he has difficulty in breathing from the sharp pains in his chest.  He never had this type of pain until he got that J &amp; J vaccine.  I am wondering if he has developed Guillain-Barre Syndrome because it sounds like some of the same symptoms.  I just want him to stop hurting.

                                                After administering the Janssen vaccine the patient began to have dizziness and difficulty breathing. The patient&#39;s airway did not completely close up as he was able to respond and talk to me. Called 911 and administered 10mL (25mg) of Diphenhydramine and gave the patient a bottle of water. He was already worked up as he was scared of needles. He continued to breath better but still had difficulty. The EMT arrived in under 5 minutes as they were already on a call close by and was rerouted. EMT administered breathing treatment and took vitals and eventually took the patient to the hospital as a precaution. (Technician administered vaccine)

                                                Approximately eight hours after receiving the shot, I started getting a headache, body aches, and chills (April 3rd, 8 p.m.).  I went to bed and had severe chills and body sweats for the entire night.  The primary symptom to report is that my heart raced all night.  It felt like it was beating at about 140 to 150 Hz or higher.  When I woke up in the morning, it felt like my chest had been pounded on all night.  The pain was in my sternum area.  The headache and body aches took a little over a day to go away.  The chest pain took a couple of days to die down.  On April 12th, I walked my dogs in the morning and felt out of breath, which isn&#39;t normal for me.  In the afternoon, while working at my desk at home, I started getting more and more severe chest pain and then started getting dizzy and felt weak.  I drove myself to the local ER and they tested me for a heart attack.  All tests came back negative.  They suggested going to another facility to get checked for clots or to make an appointment with a cardiologist.  The next day, after talking to a doctor friend, he suggested going to the ER facility to get imaged for clots and to get fully checked out.  No cardiologist appointments were available till the next week.  I went to the ER facility and was there for seven hours getting tested.  They came back and said all test results were negative and that my heart looked fine.  They did not have any suggestions for what might be causing the pain in my chest.

The patient&#39;s laboratory studies were significant for platelets 44, INR 1.2, CO2 16, AGAP 24, glucose 475, BUN 17, CR 1.55, ALT 248, AST 274, ALP 123, mg 2.9, lactate 15, troponin negative, 1st ABG:  PH 7.11, pCO2 39.4, base excess -17, PO2 46, HC03 12.6, O2 saturation 100%.  EKG showed right bundle-branch block with ST elevation in lead 3, V1, V2, V3, and V4 leads with ST depression in 1, aVL, and lead II.  Limited stat bedside echo showed akinetic septum and hypokinetic right ventricle.  The patient was taken to the cath lab.  Dr.  completed a pulmonary arteriogram and found bilateral massive emboli subsequently undergoing thrombectomy.  Patient was on epinephrine, norepinephrine, IV fluids, heparin, and propofol.   The patient was seen postprocedure in the intensive care unit while mechanically ventilated and sedated.  The patient&#39;s sedation was stopped and the patient woke up, moved all extremities, and followed some commands.  The patient&#39;s significant other was at the bedside.  He is currently on norepinephrine at 20mcg/min, epinephrine 20mcg/min, heparin per PE protocol after receiving bolus in CCL, propofol 25mcg/kg/min, and IV NS fluids.  The patient&#39;s wife reports that he has a history of chewing tobacco, but quit over 20 years ago.  She believes that he has a family history of blood clots in his sister&#39;s and maybe his dad, but she is not completely sure about that.  6/8/21: 56-year-old man who called EMS with complaints of acute onset shortness breath, was found unresponsive, apneic and without a pulse on arrival of EMS. ACLS protocol was initiated, he was brought to the emergency department where CPR was continued with Lucas device. He was intubated, required administration of 7 rounds of epinephrine, a total of 1 arm 15 minutes of resuscitation was required prior to return of spontaneous CT circulation. Cardiology was emergently consulted, he was taken to the cath had last cath lab with only mild nonobstructive CAD noted. He then underwent pulmonary angiography with the finding of saddle pulmonary embolism as well as bilateral main pulmonary artery thrombosis. He underwent mechanical thrombectomy of the right and left main pulmonary trunk, right upper middle old and lower lobe pulmonary artery, left lower lobe pulmonary artery.  Therapeutic anticoagulation was initiated with IV heparin then transition to oral Eliquis.    He was treated with empiric antibiotic therapy for presumed aspiration pneumonia. Tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed secondary to legal Rhea and acute kidney injury, renal replacement therapy was initiated with CRRT. Clinical response was favorable, he was subsequently extubated and transitioned to intermittent hemodialysis. He was assessed by Physical and Occupational therapy and recommended for acute rehabilitation placement. His been discharged today in stable medical condition to continue hemodialysis as scheduled per Nephrology at the acute rehabilitation unit.

                                                Day one was headache as expected and right arm pain. Day two I had bad headache (9) joint pain in my shoulder and hips, loud ringing ears. shortness of breathe, left lung pain. This repeated for three days so I tested by BP and found it to be 160/130. Past day 3 I started with adrenaline spikes where heart would race up and I felt like hulk and blood pressure spikes out of the random. 5/24/21, I saw my family doctor and since my BP was so random high and then low she did not want to give me meds since it could drops too low at time. For my difficulty breathing and lung pain she gave me an prescription inhaler. As of today I still have the ringing left ear, shoulder joint pain like a pin stuck in it and unable to raise over my head without using my left arm to support, high BP on average 140/132. 167/151, 126/89, 122/91,110/87, 126/84 are some examples. These at the lowest is 10&#43; point higher than my normal range of 120s over 70s. Headache continues but may be due to the higher than normal BP.

                                                I started to suffer from a numbness in my left hand that radiated into a deep pain and increasingly became intense. That pain radiated up to my shoulder and into the left quadrant of my chest. I started experiencing shortness of breath and a hypersensitivity to the heat. I went to Hospital ER and they ran a bunch of tests. I was diagnosed with a blood clot in my arm. I was given Eliquis. I was on that medication for about 2 weeks and after my second week of being on Eliquis, I started to suffer from the same symptoms. I decided to go to the Hospital. When I went there they admitted me and ran through blood tests to check for a heart attack or stroke or anything relating to the pain I was experiencing. Now I am back home and I am still taking Eliquis. As of today, I am still experiencing the symptoms. The symptoms are mild, but it&#39;s still scary. I would like to add that I have had an increase in dietary intolerance.

                                                So roughly a week after my vaccine, I started having acid reflux and wheezing and a ringing in my left ear as well. I went to see an ENT and he prescribed a medication which was to help reduce swelling in my esophagus, I do not remember the dates or the medication name I am sorry, I am in the field right now not home. He also told me to refrain from chocolate, caffeine, carbonated drinks and those things. Doing that has helped with those. The ringing in my ear he addressed as well and I went to an audiologist and they told me I had Tinnitus. Since then I have been fitted for hearing aids and that has helped the Tinnitus a little bit.

                                                On May 25, 2021, I experienced sudden onset of shortness of breath.  911 was called and resuscitated me then transported me to medical center where I experienced several episodes of cardiac arrest and resuscitation.  I was taken to the cardiac cath lab where it was discovered I had significant blood clots in all of my lung lobes (expect the left upper lobe).  The doctors were able to remove the clots.  I spent a week in the ICU sedated on a ventilator then moved to a medical floor for about 5 days, then moved to Inpatient Rehabilitation for a week.  I am continuing to recover at home.

He was sweating  and having shortness of breath. Pt. was taken to the seat where he fainted. Pt. was laid on the floor with his legs up in a step. He gained consciousness in less than 1 min.  Pt was pale. Pt. was given an alcohol swab to smell. 911 was called. First responders took his blood pressure again and blood sugar. Uncle&#39;s pt. was called and came to the Pharmacy to pick him up to avoid pt. having to drive his car back home.

Still don&#39;t have the same energy I had before the shot. I still tire easily.

The patient states he was vaccinated with the johnson and johnson COVID-19 vaccine two weeks ago. He denies any vomiting diarrhea, fevers, leg swelling, or chest pain. The patient additionally denies being around any sick contacts or any recent travel.     The patient is a 56 y.o. male evaluated for cough and SOB for 2-3 days. Possibility of pneumonia. I have lower suspicion for PE, however his oxygen saturation is less than 94%, so we will obtain a D-dimer. I have lower suspicion for ACS. Will also check COVID swab to rule out COVID despite recent vaccination.

On April 5, 2021, I went from the urgent care to the ER to having a catheter inserted into my wrist at local hospital, because they thought I was having a heart attack. Turns out I have myocardial bridging of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. I am not in pain, thankfully, but these symptoms persist. Are they being magnified by the vaccine? No one seems to know. What I do know is that since receiving the vaccine I feel this tightness in my chest and it&#39;s not going away.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient had no relevant medical history and was not on regular medication. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805022, and expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, once total administered on 01-APR-2021 on left arm for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  Patient reported that, he received the vaccine on 01-APR-2021. Approximately 2 days after he coughed and felt lightheaded and noticed some lights around his eyes. Approximately 7 days after patient noticed a list of symptoms including a pumping sensation in the right side of his head, left calf soreness, soreness in the ribcage near the heart, a tingling sensation in the fingertips and toes (but not at the center), sense of tiredness, shortness of breath, blood in stool that he referred to repeatedly as clots, right arm soreness (although the injection was given in the left arm). Patient called his doctor twice and was told to go to the hospital. Patient went to the hospital on 04-MAY-2021. Arrived at 12 PM and discharged at 11 PM approximately. Conducted a chest x-ray, took a blood sample twice, and put some stuff on patient&#39;s chest. Patient was discharged on 04-MAY-2021 and given a prescription for Motrin 800 mg taken three times per day as needed, and for cyclobenzaprine 10 mg taken twice a day as needed for spasms. Patient decided not to take these medications as he was unsure if they were pain medications and felt apprehensive. He main concerns seemed to be the pumping sensation in the right side of his head and the blood in his stool which he repeatedly referred to as a clot. His family doctor is aware of the situation and says he thinks its hemorrhoids. He refers to the clot as darker red in colour and also mentions that there is regular red blood in stool alongside the darker clot. Patient notices this about 3 times per week. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from coughing, and light headedness sensation on 03-APR-2021, was recovering from right arm soreness, and had not recovered from pumping sensation in right side of head, soreness in the ribcage near the heart/left calf soreness, tingling in the fingertips and the toes, tiredness, shortness of breathe, blood in the stool, and hemorrhoids.

This week I haven&#39;t had one day where I haven&#39;t had something going on.  I woke up day after vaccination and started feeling feverish, but going into bad chills, extreme headache, a different kind of headache than my migraines, abdominal had pain, heart rate and breathing, heart rate was elevated, breathing not normal, out of breath, deep pain right thigh at bone, did not bruise. I called cardiologist 03/25/2021, about thigh, thought it might be DVT, I followed up 03/29/2021 since I did not hear back, we spoke on the 30th, I had very high blood pressure, doc presumed I had a tress fracture of right thigh bone and that other things were related to my chronic intro viruses. I saw my infectious disease doctor on April 13th he said this could be a major conflict with either current viruses, meds taking in conjunction with vaccination. All of my major lymph nodes were inflamed. I do have non Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma, but they told me it is slow growing. Visited ER on 04/14/2021. Dr met me there.

                                                Some weeks after vaccination I started feeling shortness of breath. When I walked from the parking lot to my work desk it was hard and when I arrived at work my co-workers could hear me grasping for air, I felt winded, and it never happened before. Also, another episode when the elevator broke down I could not go the flight of stairs without having to stop and catching my breath.  Since the weather is better I decided to start walking in the park for exercise but I realized I did not have the strength nor the capacity to breathe. I amafraid at night because sometimes when I lay down I can&#39;t breathe.

                                                After a week (7 days) I noticed I was short of breath and my heart was racing most of the day.  I had my blood pressure checked for several days by the school nurse.  The readings were very high 158 over 102 at the start of school and 168 over 104 at the end of the day.  This was constant for a week before I went to the cardiologist for a check up.   The doctor prescribed Amlodipine Besylate 5mg on March 26, 2021 to lower my blood pressure.  It took roughly 10 days to get my blood pressure down to 140 over 85.

On the 6th day after my vaccine, I developed a lump on the right side of my throat which progressively got worse. I also experienced diarrhea which lasted three days. I went to see my PCP, Dr. who ordered a CT scan of my neck. The CT scan demonstrated I had an ulcer in my throat located in my larynx box. MY PCP  doctor then referred me to  an ENT doctor, Dr. The ENT doctor gave me antibiotics and a shot in my arm. My throat kept getting worse and the ENT doctor have me reflux medicine and Prednisone and Bactrum medication. Today I woke up feeling much better although the pain and swelling to my left side of my throat and ear has gone down but I still have a sore throat and ulcer and is being treated with medicine.

He received his J and J vaccine on 5/14/21  and reported &#34;everything went to downhill&#34; with development of nausea, constipation, weight loss, weakness, poor appetite resulting in hospitalization with new severe hypercalcemia and acute functional decline and dx with metastatic renal cell cancer. pt was dx with a bladder tumor 3/19, underwent TURP with bladder biopsy and fulguration and cyctoscopy on 5/19/21. Prostate bx reveals benign nodular hyperplasia, bladder bx revealed urothelial dysplasia felt to be pre neoplastic. Urine Cytology from 4/14/21 negative for high grade urothelial cardinoma. with pamidronate treatment, lasix and ivf and calcitonin his hypercalcemia improved and he was discharged to follow up with oncology and urology as out pt.  He has since been readmitted on 6/22/21 with recurrent hypercalcemia and progressive decline.   biopsy with I.R. of left renal mass confirmed RCC, biopsy of LN was non-diagnostic.  per urology: Given the small size of the renal mass, it would be surprising if this was truly metastatic RCC,   this could be metastatic urothelial carcinoma given his history of high grade T1 disease, although the primary site and the urinary tract has presumably been eradicated of disease, metastatic disease prior to initial tumor eradication in the bladder remains a possibility.

Patient almost immediately said he didn&#39;t feel right.  Patient started to lose color and was very hot. Pharmacist got up and stayed next to patient.  Patient slowly lowered  his head and started to breathe heavily.  Pharmacy technician then came over with a cool towel to place on patients head. The pharmacist couldn&#39;t tell if patient had in fact passed out because patients head was down and pharmacist was holding patient in place so he didn&#39;t fall.  The pharmacy tech was asked if patient passed out and she saw his eyes were open.  Patient then asked how long he was out for.  That was for a total of roughly 5 seconds.  Patient then stayed at pharmacy for around 45 minutes.  He regained his color and his body temp returned to normal.  He did say he was drowsy but felt he was fine to go home.  Patient was called later in the day and he said he was drowsy but feeling much better.

On the night of May 24 I began to have the worst headache of my life, my heart was beating irregular. By the morning of the 25th I got up  and passed out. I was sweating, heart pounding, nauseous, chest pain, shortness of breath, pain in my shoulder blades.
