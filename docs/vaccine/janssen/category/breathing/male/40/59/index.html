                                                Patient received Janssen vaccine around 10:30. He left the observation room feeling fine. once he got at his car and started to drive, he felt shortness of breath and some weakness. Then, he came back to the SR Vaccine site to get help around 10:50. We met him in front of the parking lot, he was having some trouble of breath and weakness. We put him in a wheelchair, brought him back to the Observation area. I asked him to lay down with elevated legs on a chair. He instantly felt better, no more shortness of breath. He did not need to use any Oxygen supply. Also, he drank some water, sit back in the chair and felt better ready to leave with his brother who came to help him just in case. At 11:10 he left the building with orientations about worsening of symptoms and when to call EMS.

                                                Got injected, didn?t hurt much. Was told to wait 15 minutes in case of reaction. They walked away and left me sitting in a chair in a public space with everyone else who was waiting. I texted my wife to check in, when I started tearing up and crying for no real reason, then started feeling nauseous so I closed my eyes.   Suddenly I felt like I had been given a shot of adrenaline out of nowhere so I?m just trying to figure out if it?s nerves or a physiological response to something. I?m trying to control my breathing but having a hard time breathing.   Then the fever hit. The most intense flash of heat. I was hyperventilating. I couldn?t open my eyes or move or make a sound, I could just sit there struggling to breathe. My phone was in my hand and I couldn?t lift it. I just simply didn?t have the strength or energy to move.   At some point I legit thought I was about to die. I managed to angle my wrist so I could check my heart rate with my watch. It was 47bpm.   I was fading away but I made myself get control of my breathing and forced myself to take long deep slow breaths. It hurt, and I felt like passing out, but I kept doing it.   Fever turned into chills and then I soaked through my jeans and T-shirt in under a minute. I was finally thinking clearly and breathing and getting oxygen. Everyone else near me was fine.   Nobody checked on me the entire time including the 3 people who sat there and watched me suffer through this.  I told the pharmacist about my reaction and asked if it was normal and didn?t receive any indication that I should be concerned, so I went home since I felt better.   It wasn?t until my friend pointed out that this sounds like anaphylaxis that I thought I should report it. So here I am. Hopefully I?ll be okay.

I have been checking in with that website (V-safe App)  you gave me no one has contacted me. Monday (5/3/21) I missed work due to me not feeling good and still today (5/5/21) I&#39;m at work but feel like I could fall asleep, no energy, nausea still, and like I haven&#39;t slept in weeks even though I get good sleep. My breathing has gotten to the point that it hurts to take a deep breath. I believe this is all due to the shot but didn&#39;t know what you thought.&#34;

Vaccinator was notified that he has a history of vasovagal response with needles. This response presents itself as sweating (and possible fainting) and is alleviated by lying down. Client mentioned that previous nurse advised him to smell an alcohol pad to distract and prevent a vasovagal response, as this had worked previously on a glucose check. No medications were disclosed or history of anaphylaxis reported. With this background information, RN offered to have vaccine administered in reclined position, however client refused. RN conferred with co-lead about administration recommendations. Vaccinator then checked in with patient at 1423 to see if patient was okay and patient did not answer the question. RN then felt the client&#39;s hand and noticed hand was clammy. At 1425 the reclining chair was brought to the station and patient was transferred into chair, appearing diaphoretic. RN palpated pulse and noted patient was not tachycardia, but RN did note tachypnea and uneasiness. RN then provided distraction and promoted relaxation. Then at 1426 patient reported feeling okay and RN noted patient no longer felt clammy. At 1440 patient was asked if he would prefer if EMS should be called, patient declined and stated that he was able to drive home. Then at 1447 patient left the site appearing well, alert and oriented x3 leaving by self in private car.

Nothing major that kept me from working or sleeping. Some time after, maybe 3rd or 4th day, I noticed a shortness of breath. This I did not expect since it&#39;s not a listed side effect for the vaccine but it is one for Covid. I notice it everyday while sitting/working. It does not keep me from being active (running/yard work) but I notice I&#39;m not 100% healthy feeling. It feels like  the shortness of breath is closer to the top of the chest/throat area if that makes any sense. If I breathe deeply it feels like I may want to cough although I don&#39;t usually cough from doing so. It&#39;s mostly just a constant feeling of a very slight shortness of breath.

Three days later around 6:25 am on April 15, 2020: I got out of bed, next moment I recall is of me on the floor. No memory of falling. I was shaking uncontrollably as if my body was getting many commands at the same time but I had no control over it. I could not call out for help. At one point I was biting my right  hand but could not make myself stop until my shaking stopped. Bite did not penetrate skin but I had visible bite mark on my hand.  I regained control suddenly and just got up slowly and shaken by the experience. Wife then drove me to the ER.  Been feeling pressure on my head.

                                                Within hours I quickly became extremely sore, fatigued, and had difficulty breathing. I was unable to eat  until the breathing issues subsided late afternoon Sunday since I felt as though I was choking when I  attempted to eat. The fatigue and body pain was pronounced enough for me to have to call off work  Monday, but they gradually diminished. I am submitting this on 3/11, and I am still experiencing some  body aches though the constant feeling of exhaustion is no longer present.

                                                I felt fine all day and went to bed at 9:30pm. I woke up to my body shaking uncontrollably and I was freezing at 10:30pm. My wife felt my skin and she said I was burning up. Unfortunately our thermometer wasn&#39;t working so I don&#39;t know my temperature, but I have never in my life shaken so badly with a fever. I couldn&#39;t control myself and I was shaking so hard that my muscles were sore from it, but I still couldn&#39;t stop. I then began vomiting every 45 minutes or so. This happened for nearly 4 hours until 2:18am. Then very suddenly everything just stopped. No more feeling cold (actually I then felt very warm and couldn&#39;t cool off. I was sweating quite a bit). No more shaking. No more vomiting. I did get a wicked headache, but I figured it was due to dehydration and took two Advil. The Advil didn&#39;t do anything and I was awake until 5:59am because my head hurt too badly to sleep. Finally I slept for about 4.5 hours. Then I just felt worn out for most of the day on the 10th, and couldn&#39;t shake the headache. Then on the evening if the 10th, I started getting a sore throat and a slightly runny nose. I went to bed that way. When I woke up on the 11th (today) I still had the sore throat and slight runny nose. The headache was gone, but I felt tightness in my chest. As I went throughout the day, I&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;m short of breath with doing most things. I have two young children, so even taking care of them I feel like at times I&#39;m struggling for breath. I&#39;m not in bad shape and am a runner, so my cardio isn&#39;t bad. So I was surprised by this.

                                                Got COVID (Janssen) vaccine shot on April 6th at noon.  Felt fine Tuesday and went to bed as normal.  Woke up April 7th at 7AM with sharp pains in my left shoulder (same side as shot) and slight shortness of breath, and slight chest pain in the left quadrant of my torso (same side as shot).  Proceeded to take Advil and seemed to help a bit.  Minor aches/pains and shortness of breath throughout the day until about 8PM.  At this time shoulder chest pain became more severe, and breathing became very strained, short, and painful.  Pain and breathing kept getting worse and at midnight on Wednesday night thought I was having a heart attack due to extreme chest pain, couldn&#39;t breath, lightheaded, dizzy, tingly extremities.  My wife drove me to ER at 12:30 AM Thursday.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: Unknown) frequency 1 total, dose was not reported, administered to left arm on 06-APR-2021 at 12 noon for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 6-APR-2021 at 12 noon, patient got vaccinated and was fine that day . Next morning on 07-APR-2021,  patient woke up with sever cramping in same shoulder which he got the shot in, most pain was in the upper left quarter of his torso to down half way to chest up to the shoulder till the neck . By the end of the day it  spread to his whole chest and upper body. Also he had shortness of breath ,could not breath .The cramping and shortness of breath came at same time. He took Advil and went along with his day . He took 3 tablet of Advil 200mg  every 4-5 hours all day ( total of 3 dose that day) . By night time the case was progressively worse as the whole chest had a lot of pain . He thought that he had heart attack . He thought that he was about to  pass out . He could not stand on his own . So his wife took him to emergency room at mid night at 12:30 am on 08-APR-2021. He stayed there for 5 hours and they did  bunch of tests , EKG which rolled out the heart attack .They did  Chest X-ray which found things then did D-dimer which its level was very high . They found  bunch of clots in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides. They did ultra sound on the legs  which had no evidence of blood clots . They discharged him  from the emergency room as  they felt that he was ok to be out . After couple of hours after discharge , patient&#39;s health care professional wrote for him Eliquis, antibiotic and pain reliver. He was given antibiotic because he had  beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed) . It was found air sacs in lung with signs of pneumonia in both lobes . He came home and started to  monitor his blood oxygen . He stayed in the  same position till recovery . He was better each day since last week but still had sinus and cramping in the chest ( very minor but was still there). The lung capacity was very limited to take some steps. Patient stated that he needed a specialist to understand his condition. He had no medical history before that incidence . He was wondering regarding which type of blood thinner was good for this type of blood clots because he read that the regular blood thinners are not good for that type of blood clot which his HCP gave (regular blood thinner). Laboratory data included: Total lung capacity decreased (NR: not provided) lung capacity is very limited. On 08-APR-2021, Laboratory data included: Chest X-ray (NR: not provided) found things, EKG (NR: not provided) rolled out heart attack, Fibrin D dimer (NR: not provided) level was very high, and Ultrasound scan (NR: not provided) no evidence of blood clots.  Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included: apixaban, and ibuprofen. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of the severe cramping in left shoulder and upper body, chest pain (whole chest had lot of pain)/thought that he had heart attack, shortness of breath/could not breath, thought that he was about to pass out, difficulty in standing, bunch of clots in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides, beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed), cramping in chest and sinus was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments:  This 44-year-old male patient reported blood clots of both lungs 2 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  The patient denies any medical history/condition prior to vaccination.  The symptoms reported were severe cramping of arm that spread to his whole chest and upper body and shortness of breath; the patient thought he had a heart attack, about to pass out and could not stand because of the progression of pain.  EKG done at the emergency room ruled out heat attack, D-Dimer was reported to be very high, clots were found in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides, x-ray showed beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed).  The patient was prescribed with Eliquis, an unspecified antibiotic and pain reliever.  Outcome of the events were not reported.   Based on the information that is available, the event is assessed as plausible with the causal association to immunization, per WHO causality classification of adverse events following immunization based on a lack of a definitive plausible biological mechanism.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after receiving the vaccination, my throat became dry and my eyes began watering. It was hard to tell but my throat felt slightly swollen also. I drank some water and a few minutes later things seemed to clear up. Randomly throughout the afternoon I had similar dry/itchy/tingling in my throat but not as strong as the time right after the vaccination. I didn&#39;t suspect this was directly related to the virus since I have allergies to grasses, trees, pollen, etc. and take over the counter allergy medicine as needed.  At 3:30am today (4/10/21) I woke up having to use the restroom and when standing up out of bed I was extremely dizzy. After laying down in bed the dizziness disappeared. When waking up later in the morning the dizziness/light headed feeling was still present when standing. I also have noticed random strange pinching pain in my legs that only last for 1-2 seconds and sends a quick short pain sensation throughout my body.    I have no clue if any of this is related to the vaccination received, but after noticing news articles with issues in a few folks receiving the Janssen vaccine, I decided I would pass this info along just in case.

                                                On March 13, I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine at the  clinic  The pharmacist monitored me for symptoms but there were none right away. I did have a fever and some body aches in the two or three days that followed but those were short-lived.  While driving on March 16, I started experiencing some irregular breathing and periods of shortness of breath about three hours after leaving home. I stopped at the emergency room at the Health Center where Dr diagnosed me with an acute pulmonary embolism after discovering a small blood clot in one of my lungs. He prescribed me with Eliquis, which I am still taking today. Their phone number is provided if you have questions.  I haven&#39;t had too many shortness of breath episodes lately but do not know if the blood clot is still there. I am scheduled to see my hematologist on April 27 to get further updates on this. My hematologist Dr is located in clinic number provided While it has not yet been proven that the vaccine caused the blood clot in my lung, I feel the need to report this in the wake of recent news about the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. My hematologist and primary care physician are both aware that I have received the vaccine but I have not received any further communication from them.

                                                Patient was doing paperwork when he experienced the worst headache of his life on 4/17 with associated emesis. Patient found to have a Hunt Hess 3 Fisher Grade 3 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage with hydrocephalus s/p EVD,  s/p cerebral angiogram on 4/18 negative for aneurysm/AVM. On the evening of 4/20, patient became acutely hypoxic with wheezing for which he required oxygen via 10L oxymask. During 4/21, his oxygen requirements continued to increase with increased work of breathing requiring high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) at 50L/60%  &#43; pulmonary congestion on imaging and he was treated with diuresis. On 4/22, oxygen needs increased requiring 70L/100% with worsening imaging. He was then started on steroids, antibiotics were broadened, epoprostenal started in addition to diuresis. On 4/23, patient reports improved breathing and is on non-rebreather. Antibiotics, steroids, and epoprostenal were discontinued as patient showed improvement of oxygenation without clear signs of infection. Of note,  patient reports vaping in the past 2-3 months.  Patient has also been intermittently febrile. Wife was concerned that these symptoms were possibly related to him getting the J&amp;J vaccine on 4/11. Patient is currently still in hospital on day 6 of admission at this time.

Never happened before and I&#39;ve had other Lobster on the east coast before.  I also ate shrimp a few days prior to vaccination with no reaction.  I have eaten other Lobster all my life with no reaction.    My sinuses and throat closed up making it very difficult to breathe.   I didn&#39;t know what was happening so I took decongestants and antihistamines then went to the doctor and got injected with a steroid immune suppressor.  I now have epinephrine just in case it happens again.

It persisted the rest of the day and all day Tuesday.  I also felt soreness of limbs (both arms and legs) intermittently for the 48 hours.  I had shortness of breath for the next day.  I felt extreme fatigue for the next 48 hours.  I felt my heart racing off and on for 24 hours,  I felt a loss of strength in both arms and legs for the next 48 hours.  Monday Night I woke up sweating as I had a fever.  The fever persisted off and on for about 24 hours. I was irritable (probably due to not feeling well) for about 48 hours.  My wife had to drive me home.

He developed 3 serous filled bulla with the largest measuring  5cm by 2.5cm with surrounding erythema and tenderness to palpation in the area.  This was associated with headache, diaphoresis, shortness of breath, substernal chest discomfort, and sensation of throat itching. By 72 hours the bulla had popped and the patient&#39;s the only remaining symptom was right upper arm pain.

                                                Since receiving the vaccine, I have developed tightness in my chest and shortness of breath.  At times, it has been severe.  Feeling like I might pass out, I went to Immediate Care on 04/12.  They didn?t identify a cause.  On 04/15, I went to my Doctor, who noted wheezing in my upper lungs.  An inhaler and pantoprazole were prescribed.  At times, it feels like I am having something similar to an asthma attack.  The inhaler has helped.  Prior to the vaccine, I didn?t have any history of breathing problems, nor does it run in my family.

Pt has taken Pepto Bismol for his symptoms and will probably need to go to the ER since he is having trouble breathing.   He feels like he has had such a bad reaction to this since he possibly has had the covid vax in the past 90 days.

About a week later, I started coughing a lot. My head hurt,but i didn&#39;t run any fever. I thought I was having bad allergies from changing weather, but it lasted longer than usual, over a week. I was sore, tired, not really hungry. I feel better now, but I still have this lingering dry cough and it won&#39;t completely go away. I still feel sore and very tired. I get a headache every now and then. I thought it was allergies, but it falls into the time period that people are having reactions to this JJ Janssen shot. The cough is annoying. I get short breathed and winded rather easily or more easily now. I thought I&#39;d at least report it.

The following Monday, I woke up with sharp pains across my chest and shortness of breath. I was admitted to the hospital Emergency Room for about 7 hours and subsequently diagnosed with pericarditis. It is unknown if the pericarditis was associated to the vaccine but thought it was a good idea to document here.

I have also have and continue to have shortness of breath and chest pains resulting in two panic attacks within the last three days. This has led me to report this and I have doctor visit scheduled for 4/22. I also reported today based on internet search of reactions.

                                                About 1 week after vaccination, I noted sensations of fullness or bloatedness.  It felt like gas trapped in my upper abdomen that could not be relieved by burping.  Within 2 days, I began to have pain in lower, left rib cage akin to side cramps/stitch after strenuous running, but persisted the entire day.  About 2-3 days later,  the pain intensified and spread throughout my diaphragm region (left and right sides).   Breathing was somewhat affected, after semi-strenuous activities, such as walking up/down stairs.  So, I avoided physical exercise, and took Advil for a couple days to minimize the pain.  After another 3-4 days, the pain in the diaphragm region subsided.  I have not experienced further discomfort for the past week (today is 4/21/2021).  No treatments were sought during this period.  I self-researched the symptoms and hypothesize the pain stemmed from a swollen spleen, which might have been caused by an overactive immune system due to the vaccine.

Today date I am feeling better with minor unsteadiness here and there and a slight pain deep inside the middle of head almost like a headache for a few seconds then goes away, So far so good I think. I did call doctor to note on chart. Thank you!

Prior to that, I have been having some problems breathing after getting the vaccine and have been using my Ventolin  more often after the vaccine. Also noticed shortly after getting the vaccine, a feeling of liquid in my right ear.  the liquid in the ear did go away a day before the dizziness started.  Did not consider the ear or breathing issues as possible side effects  as I do have asthma and figured the ear was congestion. Not sure if the dizziness and the feeling of liquid in my right ear are related and/or related to the vaccine.

I began to have pain in my chest that was getting progressively worse, yesterday I had a very sharp pain when taking a shallow breath.  I went to the hospital they thought I had pneumonia, but then saw a blood clot in right upper side, I&#39;ve had a prior event but that was attached to an injury in 2012. I&#39;ve not had any other issues.

This lasted for several hours after... At 11:30pm, almost 7 hours after the shot, I started to feel lousy. I started to get body aches and chills. Within 30 minutes they were fairly intense body aches and chills, shaking. At 1:00am I started to feel nauseas . At 1:30 am I started dry heaving. At approximately 2:30 I threw up twice, and the dry heaving and nausea lasting until 4am , when I took an anti nausea pill. I finally fell asleep at 430am. I woke up at 8am and felt tired, and no longer nauseated.

When called back due to his vaccination dates being after event start dates, the patient said that his memory is not too good, so he &#39;had to take his time to remember the correct dates&#39;. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S was not applicable. The patient was recovering from blood clot in leg, and had not recovered from runny nose, shortness of breath, heart rate increased, chills, feeling hot, gangrene in toe, right leg swollen, and right foot swollen. This report was serious (caused hospitalization).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 50-year-old  hypertensive and diabetic male patient reported that he was feeling hot and may need to have his fifth toe amputated because it has gangrene 4 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and 2 days after discharge form the hospital.  The patient was hospitalized for shortness of breath, heart rate increased, runny nose, and chills 28 days prior to vaccination.  The patient went to the emergency room 2 days prior to vaccination because his toenails/skin on his toes were coming off, swelling in his right foot and up his leg, gangrene in his toe; he reported that there was no circulation going to his toe and was diagnosed with having a blood clot in his right leg; the patient reported he had surgery to &#34;open up&#34; the arteries in his leg. Four days after vaccination, the patient felt hot and reported reported that he may need to have his right pinky (fifth) toe amputated because it has gangrene.  The patient is taking paracetamol as treatment.  No other details was reported.  Based on the lack of temporal association, the causality is considered not related for the events blood clot in leg, shortness of breath, heart rate increased, right leg swelling, right foot swelling, chills, and runny nose.  The information available regarding event gangrent of fifth toe and feeling hot precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

Saturday April 23rd Went to er was treated for kidney stones but they could only find one small one,  Was sent home with pain medication.  Shortness of breath persisted as did bloody cough and pain in chest and all over. Went back to the er on 4/28 as pain was unbearable (chest pain)  once given a cat scan and diagnosed with blood clots in my lungs and then an ultra sound and found a blood clot in my leg (just above knee).  It is thought that I was mis-diagnosed on the original trip to the er with kidney stones.  I have been put on blood thinners and pain medication and will be following up with my doctor.

                                                Patient had arm tingling shortly after injection. Pt stayed in store for about 4 hours after 2pm injection, no redness or swelling noticed. Pt was quite anxious &amp; nervous (but already has severe anxiety). Pharmacist called patient following afternoon, the 11th and patient noted he was doing marginally better but still sounded anxious. Pharmacist called patient on Fri the 12th 5:16p and this was when the patient explained the following: Muscle stiffness on left side &amp; pain down left leg; cranial pain; shoulder stiffness; nasal congestion; some shortness of breath; soreness &amp; fatigue.  Patient called back and said he had partial shortness of breath at 7:34p on the 12th.  On Sat the 13th at 11am, pharmacist called to check on pt; found him quite agitated &amp; saying, &#34;He feels the shot was botched&#34;, noted he had called Janssen to report his issues.  At 4:30pm, pt came to pharmacy, looked fine, arm showed no redness, was more subdued in person than on the phone earlier. He said he was feeling better but was not happy with Janssen and wanted the Moderna 2 series shot because he feels Janssen&#39;s vaccine wasn&#39;t doing what it was supposed to.

He was transferred to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a flesh eating bacteria in the right leg where the pain was at and Sepsis.  He was taken to surgery to debride the right leg and was started on CVVHD because his new kidney was now failing, he eventually was started back on Hemodialysis and taken to surgery 2 more times where he cardiac arrested on the table in surgery and died.  A private autopsy is being performed but the preliminary results shows he had multi-system organ failure, including his liver which was NEVER a problem in the past.

                                                I experienced two days later bad earaches for some hours. I also had SOB.   Today, I am applying ear drops in my ear due to my ear aches.

Went to urgent Care on 4/8 where treated for severe dehydration and stomach aligment.  From 4/9 - 4/14 continued to suffer from same symptoms and then began to have heart taching, feeling as if there was a bubble in my chest.  Went back to Urgent Care on 4/14 and was again treated for dehydration.  Outcome is that no one knows why I have been feeling this way except for that it is a direct result of receiving the vaccine.

We requested him to stay in observation for 30 minutes after vaccine administration. He agreed and vaccine was administered. After working  approximately 3 hours later he returned to the pharmacy stating he felt out of breath. He didn&#39;t know if it was because of vaccine or CHF. Questioning him further, he said he felt a little swollen around neck. He was responsive. Administered 50mg of Benadryl. Instructed him to sit. He had a portable fan. After sitting down, he started to feel better. He remained at the pharmacy and called for transportation home, leaving approximately 1 hour later

                                                I was admitted to the ER on 4/12/21 with dizziness, lightheadedness, vertigo, some auditory issues, shortness of breath, swelling/puffiness of legs and feet, unusual coldness in extremities, and some minor pain in chest. CT-Scan revealed DVT in left leg and PEs in both lungs. Was given two shots of heparin over a 24-hour period and then Xarelto 15mg (oral) the following day.

                                                After administering the Janssen vaccine the patient began to have dizziness and difficulty breathing. The patient&#39;s airway did not completely close up as he was able to respond and talk to me. Called 911 and administered 10mL (25mg) of Diphenhydramine and gave the patient a bottle of water. He was already worked up as he was scared of needles. He continued to breath better but still had difficulty. The EMT arrived in under 5 minutes as they were already on a call close by and was rerouted. EMT administered breathing treatment and took vitals and eventually took the patient to the hospital as a precaution. (Technician administered vaccine)

At night I had a mild fever, chills, body aches (everywhere) unbearable headache (still going on 24 hours after the shot), pain at the vaccination site (left shoulder, still strong after 24 hours), pain in the lungs (I sneezed a couple of times).  I took Tylenol every 4 hours, but did not improve, only brought the fever down a bit.  Today after 24 hours, I still have headache, muscular aches, and fatigue.

                                                Approximately eight hours after receiving the shot, I started getting a headache, body aches, and chills (April 3rd, 8 p.m.).  I went to bed and had severe chills and body sweats for the entire night.  The primary symptom to report is that my heart raced all night.  It felt like it was beating at about 140 to 150 Hz or higher.  When I woke up in the morning, it felt like my chest had been pounded on all night.  The pain was in my sternum area.  The headache and body aches took a little over a day to go away.  The chest pain took a couple of days to die down.  On April 12th, I walked my dogs in the morning and felt out of breath, which isn&#39;t normal for me.  In the afternoon, while working at my desk at home, I started getting more and more severe chest pain and then started getting dizzy and felt weak.  I drove myself to the local ER and they tested me for a heart attack.  All tests came back negative.  They suggested going to another facility to get checked for clots or to make an appointment with a cardiologist.  The next day, after talking to a doctor friend, he suggested going to the ER facility to get imaged for clots and to get fully checked out.  No cardiologist appointments were available till the next week.  I went to the ER facility and was there for seven hours getting tested.  They came back and said all test results were negative and that my heart looked fine.  They did not have any suggestions for what might be causing the pain in my chest.

He was sweating  and having shortness of breath. Pt. was taken to the seat where he fainted. Pt. was laid on the floor with his legs up in a step. He gained consciousness in less than 1 min.  Pt was pale. Pt. was given an alcohol swab to smell. 911 was called. First responders took his blood pressure again and blood sugar. Uncle&#39;s pt. was called and came to the Pharmacy to pick him up to avoid pt. having to drive his car back home.

The patient states he was vaccinated with the johnson and johnson COVID-19 vaccine two weeks ago. He denies any vomiting diarrhea, fevers, leg swelling, or chest pain. The patient additionally denies being around any sick contacts or any recent travel.     The patient is a 56 y.o. male evaluated for cough and SOB for 2-3 days. Possibility of pneumonia. I have lower suspicion for PE, however his oxygen saturation is less than 94%, so we will obtain a D-dimer. I have lower suspicion for ACS. Will also check COVID swab to rule out COVID despite recent vaccination.

                                                Some weeks after vaccination I started feeling shortness of breath. When I walked from the parking lot to my work desk it was hard and when I arrived at work my co-workers could hear me grasping for air, I felt winded, and it never happened before. Also, another episode when the elevator broke down I could not go the flight of stairs without having to stop and catching my breath.  Since the weather is better I decided to start walking in the park for exercise but I realized I did not have the strength nor the capacity to breathe. I amafraid at night because sometimes when I lay down I can&#39;t breathe.

I had my blood pressure checked for several days by the school nurse.  The readings were very high 158 over 102 at the start of school and 168 over 104 at the end of the day.  This was constant for a week before I went to the cardiologist for a check up.   The doctor prescribed Amlodipine Besylate 5mg on March 26, 2021 to lower my blood pressure.  It took roughly 10 days to get my blood pressure down to 140 over 85.

On the 6th day after my vaccine, I developed a lump on the right side of my throat which progressively got worse. I also experienced diarrhea which lasted three days. I went to see my PCP, Dr. who ordered a CT scan of my neck. The CT scan demonstrated I had an ulcer in my throat located in my larynx box. MY PCP  doctor then referred me to  an ENT doctor, Dr. The ENT doctor gave me antibiotics and a shot in my arm. My throat kept getting worse and the ENT doctor have me reflux medicine and Prednisone and Bactrum medication. Today I woke up feeling much better although the pain and swelling to my left side of my throat and ear has gone down but I still have a sore throat and ulcer and is being treated with medicine.
