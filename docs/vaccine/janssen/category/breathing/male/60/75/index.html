                                                COVID infection post vaccination  1 day following vaccination, patient experienced fatigue, myalgia and low grade fever.  RA test positive.  That evening, patient with increasing SOB and increasing oxygen requirement and was admitted for hypoxia &#43; LE swelling.  Although SNF where vaccination took place denied symptoms at time of vaccination, per H&amp;P, increasing oxygen requirements were noted 3 days prior to vaccination.   See H&amp;P below  He is currently residing in a rehab facility following a hospitalization detailed below, but essentially he noted some shortness of breath about 4-5 days ago. They checked his oxygen saturation and noted that he was hypoxic, so started him on oxygen (reportedly 4L NC?). He reports a worsened productive cough; sputum is dark but not bloody in color. He has been fatigued and chilled; he thinks he&#39;s been intermittently febrile. No nausea, vomiting, or constipation. He endorses twice daily diarrhea, but he associates this with his bowel regimen. He also has a fair amount of lower extremity swelling which is bothersome to him; he says this has been ongoing since his MVA in January.[KE.4] He was recently seen in Nephrology clinic, where he was started on lasix 40mg daily and started on a low sodium diet[KE.3]. He is unsure if the lasix is helping his swelling, but does have robust urine output after he takes it

He then tried to calm down and got back into bed . He was holding my hand when suddenly his hand felt cold. I turned on the light to find his eyes rolled back and he was gasping his last breath . This was about 5:20 AM . Patient was a healthy active man.

I sat upright for about 1.5 hrs and respiration returned to a normal rhythm at which time I was comfortable enough to return to bed.  I did not seek medical attention but monitored closely during that time and was prepared to go to the ER if necessary.  As I write this I am at 22 hrs post vaccination.  Respiration is fine, I have some discomfort at the injection site, a slight headache and some aches and pains which is expected.

                                                Three weeks after the vaccine my ankles were swelled up. I gained 30 pounds over the course of fourteen days. I was having trouble breathing. I was admitted to the hospital and diagnosed with Atrial Fibrillation and Congestive Heart Failure. I also had water in my lungs. I have not had any heart symptoms before that. I tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies in June of 2020. I had multiple tests on every organ. There were no clogged arteries and no heart problems except for AFIB. My blood pressure is fine but I am taking half a blood pressure pill. I am trying to lose weight. I am scheduled to see a cardiologist on 05/25/2021

Upon admissions, she stated he was tested for COVID and the test came back as positive. Wife upset due to the belief that the shot has caused her husbands condition and that we should be aware that hospitals are still testing for COVID and considering it positive even though her husband had been vaccinated.  I tried to explain that he had not had the two full weeks since being vaccinated to have full immunity and that he could have been exposed early enough that he was still able to develop into actual illness.

                                                Saturday evening May 1 I met with nine friends (all vaccinated) and ate a lot of food, drank moderately, and then did not sleep well. Approximately noon the next afternoon (Sunday, May2) while driving I noticed a developing dry-cough, chest congestion, and general fatigue. While camping that night I had some chills, thought I might have a bit of a fever, and had little appetite. I arrived home Tuesday, May 4 coughing a lot and very fatigued. Wednesday morning I went in for a Covid test. My cough and fatigue continued to increase along with muscle pain and headache. Wednesday night my fever topped out near 104. It broke and I felt much better but for the next few days (until around May 11) it fluctuated between normal and around 100-102. The Covid test came back negative but I went back for another just in case. It too came back negative. My temperature has now stabilized, the cough and congestion are mostly gone. I&#39;m still a bit tired but feeling much better. It seemed like a case of Covid without the Covid. I am glad I got vaccinated but that was rough.

                                                For the first two weeks, there was only mild headache and fatigue.  But on day 12 (or 13) following the shot, my husband had severe abdominal pain and black, tarry poop.  He passed out on the toilet in the middle of the night and hit his head, woke up in a puddle of blood (from hitting his head) . He was severely lightheaded, short of breath, could not walk.  He had to crawl back to bed.  He continued to have severe  lightheadedness, shortness of breath, muscle aches, abdominal pain, and also ringing in his ears.  He called me early Saturday morning and told me what happened and that he called out from work.  (We do not live together. He is 280 miles away because of his job.) That man has called out sick only one time since I&#39;ve met him in 1998; so when he told me he did not go to work, I knew it had to be really bad.  I drove up there ASAP the same day, and I took the pulse oximeter with me.  His oxygen levels were all over the place.  They were usually better (like high 70s to low 80s) while he was lying down.  When he would sit up or stand up, the number would plummet, reading so low I thought he was going to die. One time his finger was so cold that it took me 4 tries to get a reading.  It read at 55, but I realize that might be because his finger was too cold.

Aches were severe for 14 days, moderate for 12 additional days, mild for 10 additional days.  Treated abdominal pain with Advil.  Shortness of breath after mild exertion - like walking the dogs around the block.  Shortness of breath still persists today after 5 weeks.  I am concerned the shortness of breath may be due to a PE blood clot.

                                                About 10 days after the shot I could not breath.  It came on over the course of a few hours to the point that my doctor told me to go to the ER.  There they administered a nebulizer and a prescription for prednisone for 4 days which helped.   24 hours after the prednisone prescription was complete, the breathing difficulty resurfaced and I was back in the ER again.  This time they gave me a longer course of prednisone (10 days) that reduced over that time.  Once that course was complete the breathing difficulty started again, but not to the point of an ER visit.  My GP then prescribed a smaller dose of Prednisone over 6 days combined with an inhaler.  That has helped.  I don&#39;t really know if this is related to the vaccine.  My suspicion is that the vaccine may have revved up my immune system and because of my autoimmune disease it attached my airway.  But that is just a guess.

I could not focus my vision and tried to vomit also also but immediately went to bed. Throughout the day/night when i got up I was unable to walk/see as normal and required my hand on the wall for balance. I also felt nauseated and could not eat anything during this time. I was able to sleep mostly and as of this submittal(04/13/21 7:51 pm CT) i have been symptom free for several hours. No medical treatment was sought due to no health insurance. All symptoms indicate stroke .

He then on the 9th day had extreme intercostal pain in the ribs on the right side and his right shoulder extremely painful, low grade fever, chills, fatigue and inability to draw a full breath.  He called the doctor and they were on the way to the clinic they told him to go to the ER based on his symptoms.  He went to the ER and they admitted him and did blood work, and then did a chest x-ray, then a chest CT scan and it was positive for pulmonary embolism.  He was treated with an anti-inflammatory through the IV and a blood thinner to the stomach.  He was hospitalized for 1 full day, and discharged home with Eliquis double dose for 14 days and then a single dose until further notice.    He is still having fatigue and aches on the right side of his brain and aches in his feet, but is to see a pulmonologist for his lungs, as it will take up to 6 months for it to resolve.  He also has damage to the right side of the heart and lung.  Is waiting to get a CT of the brain.

                                                Client left message on immunization nurses line 04/13/2021 stating he received J&amp;J vaccine on Friday, and is having a severe reaction, can&#39;t eat, drink, breathing problems, hasn&#39;t been able to pee for 4-5 days, throwing up and severe diarrhea, and he can&#39;t stand.  I returned his call and he verbalized all issues above and also said his legs, arms and hands were cramping up and having ringing in the ears.  I recommended him to go to the ER now, he said he had called his PCP and was told the same thing.  He stated he is single and lives alone and does not drive.  I told him to call 911 and he verbalized he is too embarrassed to do that and states he will wait for his daughter to call him.  I offered to call his daughter for him and he declined.   Addendum: Created by RN. 04/16/2021 02:01 PM 04/16/2021 Client called reporting the same symptoms as in 4/13 message -- I told him to go to the ER immediately. He stated he could not drive due to muscle spasms and feet and leg pain. Asked if he would please call 911 and stated that was not necessary. He verbalized he understood my directions and stated he would go to urgent Care. Called Sheriff office to make a well person check.

                                                I started getting a headache about an hour along with pain in the back of my neck and a mild headache after my shot (maybe an hour or so).  Around 1100 hours, about the time I got back from the Facility, I began to feel a tightness in my throat and got a little raspy.  When I drank water and ate a little, it hurt similar a hangover as if dehydrated, but went away after a minute or so. About 1400 hours began to develop chills, causing me to get into bed, and then the chills, overall muscular pains, very tired, moderate headache and some nausea ensued as well along with an initial low grade fever.    Fever went up to 102.1 degrees and had fever till about 2130 hours and broken only after I took two (1) Tylenols. Still had a very low grade fever till about 2300 hours or so (99-100), but finally went away.    I awoke next day (13 APR) about 0800 feeling a bit better, but with a moderate headache and touch of diarrhea.  Headache lasted all day.  This prompted me to contact my treatment facility and a telecall was conducted giving them my symptoms.  They recommended Rizatriptan should my headache continue and Tylenol not enough to relieve.  I cannot take any analgesics due to my liver disease and Thrombocytopenia.  Finally  my headache went away (with a slight hint it might come back), but no more fever, chills etc.    On 14 APR, no more headache but still felt a little tired.  From 15 APR through today (16 APR), no further symptoms and feel great, but prepared to report anything that may develop laer.

                                                On Jan. 26, 2021, I had an accident at home an suffered  broken ankle, tibia and fibula broken from tarsus.  I was rushed to hospital and had ORIF surgery.  I later found out the surgeons failed to order blood thinners and about a month later, I was rushed to the hospital with 5 blood clots, one in each lobe or each lung and one forming in the calf muscle on the left leg.  I have been taking Eliquis since late February and will be on it through May.  I have had an echocardiogram which was normal but the doppler I had on my legs may have indicated the problem is still on-going.  I don&#39;t know yet.  I did contract JCCT to ask if I should get checked out due to recent clotting incidents and was told I did not.  I decided I should report it anyway and my clotting situation probably has nothing to do with vaccine but I just want to make sure.

                                                Four days after the vaccine I felt a little chest tightness but the next day it was very scary like a weight on my chest. I also had a cough that was an uncontrollable tickle and then I had trouble catching my breath. I went to the Urgent Care they just thought I had Acid Reflux.. Seven days after my cough was worse and I was very short of breath and I had very bad night sweats. I went to the doctor he gave me Asthma medicine. Two weeks after the vaccine I went back to the Urgent care and they thought Bronchitis. I went back to the ER and I saw a Covid-19 doctor and he thought I had Covid-19 symptoms. He gave me Prednisone and Azithromycin. I took the Prednisone for ten days and I finally started to feel better. I was trying to chew some fresh ginger helped the cough. I have a Heart Echo scheduled next week and I am still a little short of breath. Before the shot I used to walk two or three miles a day and go fishing every day but I can?t do that right now. At least I am back to 80% now which is better.

Patient began having some blood in his sputum since this morning at 4AM, and that occurred twice more with intervals of a few hours, both continuously improving and less blood. No other symptoms. No history of TB, no exposure to sick contacts, no recent travel. Unlikely a pulmonary embolus given normal vital signs and no risk factors. Patient was doing outdoor work in his yard for the past few days before the symptom onset and was working on mulch and compost. Although unlikely to have fungal infection currently, may be bacterial pneumonia

                                                4/25/2021 - He was apparently well until 2 days prior to admission when he developed spontaneous left calf pain and swelling.  He denies any associated trauma, recent travel and immobility.  He is not taking any new prescription, including steroids. One day prior to admission, he started experiencing left-sided pleuritic chest pain up to 9/10 in intensity and exertional shortness of breath.  He denies any fevers, hemoptysis, sputum production, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness or lightheadedness.  The pain was persistent throughout the day.  Today, his chest pain persisted and his shortness of breath had progressed.  He also noted left arm swelling with mild discomfort.  He felt that his left leg swelling and pain had improved today.  Nevertheless, given persistent symptoms, he decided to come to the emergency room for further evaluation management.   In the emergency room, his initial blood pressure was 218/104 with mild tachycardia of 99, normal oxygen saturation and no fevers.  CBC showed a white count of 12.35, hematocrit of 50.4 and normal platelet count 198.  INR was normal at 1.06.  BMP showed mild hyperglycemia at 148.  Troponin was 5 and BNP was 8.  Imaging studies show extensive left upper extremity DVTs that involved the left subclavian vein, left lower extremity DVTs and bilateral lower lobe pulmonary emboli.   4/30/2021 Presumed unprovoked extensive DVT of the left upper extremity and left lower extremity.  However, he did recently receive Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine.  Now status post catheter directed thrombolysis to the left upper extremity.

                                                I felt dizzy and had problems with breathing right away after the injection. A doctor from that site who checked my vitals wanted to call an ambulance to take me to a hospital. I couldn&#39;t let this happen as I was 120 miles away from my apartment, where two dogs were left unattended. I decided to come back home and monitor my vital signs. Since that time, I had almost every other day a chest pain and high blood pressure and low level of O2 but was too busy at work to care of myself. On 04.30.2021 around 3am I decided to drive into ER at where I was admitted and had CABG surgery on Tuesday 05/04/2021.

I started having an intermittent cough due to the vaccine (felt like my lungs were not feeling great) This occurred during the evening and at night when I would lay down to rest. I had a fairly mild case of COVID-19 (tested at the beginning) and quarantined for three weeks. A month later I took the blood test for antibodies (actually had COVID-19 last June which is nearly a year ago before taking the Janssen vaccine). My blood sugar is off the charts and my blood pressure has elevated since taking the vaccine (reason for awaiting an appointment with my doctor).

                                                On or around March 19 developed a dry cough with shortness of breath.  Was hospitalized on March 23  and diagnosed with interstitial lung disease and is currently on a ventilator.  The diagnosis is unknown but suspected amiodorone toxicity or Sjogrens.  Both are rare  side effects.  He is on high dose steroids and  antibiotics but  no improvement.   Has never had lung issues prior to the shot.  He has never smoked.  Onset of disease was rapid and progressed quickly.   Is it possible shot triggered the acute lung disease?

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension and congestive heart failure, presents with shortness of breath that started on Friday and worsened significantly this morning.  He does have some chest discomfort with this.  No fevers, chills, or other complaints.  Discharge Diagnoses   1. Hypertensive emergency, 04/13/2021  2. Chest discomfort, 04/14/2021  3. Heart failure, systolic, 04/13/2021  Assessment and Plan 65M w/ HTN and HFrEF p/w hypoxic respiratory failure i/s/o a hypertensive emergency. BP and respiratory status much improved, admitted to CCU for acute BP management and medication titration.   #HTN Emergency Likely precipitated by lack of medication non-adherence since 04/11, when he ran out of his medications. SBP approx 220 at time of presentation, good response to enalapril and nitro gtt. Decreased work of breathing with Bi-pap. MAP 130-140 on presentation, will attempt to lower by 20-25% in first 2-6hrs w/ MAP goal of approx 100, while aiming towards normotensive in next 24-48 hrs while transitioning from IV to PO meds. -TTE ordered -cont incremental BP mgmt:  -goal MAP &lt; 110    -prn hydralazine  -gradual goal towards normotensive over next 24-48hrs thereafter -cardiac monitor -will ensure that patient has anti-hypertensives prior to DC -q4hr neuro checks  #Acute Hypoxic and Hypercapnic respiratory failure  Decreased work of breathing with Bi-pap. Likely related to HTN emergency as above in addition to moderate-severe volume overload as seen on CXR. VBG in am of 4/13 showed pH 7.17, pCO2 64, pO2 58, bicarb 24. -cont Bi-pap, will wean as tolerable  -repeat VBG this am for resp acidosis  #HFrEF w/ acute exacerbation Last echo 04/14/2017, LVEF 38%, cxr on admission shows moderate-severe volume overload. -TTE ordered on 4/13 -may consider additional diuresis, given furosemide in ED on presentation, mindful of BP -goal net negative 1-2L/24hrs as pressures permit -daily standing weights -fluid and sodium restriction when off Bi-Pap  #NSTEMI Likely type II given HTN emergency, did have chest pain on presentation which was relieved with BP control. -trend trops until flat, next at 08:00  #type II DM Hgb A1c 7.5% on 4/13, mild hyperglycemia on presentation -SSI  #polycythemia Could be indicative of undiagnosed OSA vs manifestation of heart failure. Additionally, hemoconcentration from CHF i/s/o HTN emergency is another possibility. -TTE as above -ctm w/ am labs  #lymphocytosis Afebrile, no urinary symptoms. Hypoxic on presentation, likely related to edema i/s/o HTN emergency as above. No suspicion for infectious etiology at this time, no white count. -ctm w/ am labs  #HLD -cont statin  #QTC prolongation 561 on 4/13/2021 -avoid QTc prolonging medications

Patient&#39;s head leaned to the left side,  started slurring and became unconcious while his eyes were open.  I tried to get the patient&#39;s attention but saying &#34;hello, are you still with me?&#34; loudly and he did not respond.  His eyes were still open at the time. At that point I yelled for help and other colleagues were calling &#34;911&#34; immediately. Based on store protocol and knolwedge of  CPR and CDC guidlines, I checked for pulse and respiration - did not have any.  I grabbed epinephrine injection 0.3 mg and injected him on left thigh. He immediately gasped for air, then started to faint again. His face color turned pale. At this point he is still sitting upright and EMT has arrived. His blood pressure was lower than normal based on EMT report.  I called the patient on 5/12/21 (one day post-event) and patient reported no adverse reaction from vaccine site, he also reported taking 1.5 hours nap. The injection site on epineprhine injection was somewhat painful.

He continued to worsen with the exhaustion daily and now can barely get out of bed, or sit up. Before the vaccine he was not spending time in bed during the day. He now has trouble breathing sitting up.

                                                Patient was administered the Johnson and Johnson Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.  Shortly after, a few seconds, the patient stated he felt flushed and head started to fall back. Staff member cradled his head and called another staff member over.  Staff member called 9-1-1.  Patient went unconscious and his eyes rolled back for approximately 30 seconds.  When aware, we (staff members) transferred patient from the chair to the floor where staff member supported his back and fanned him due to his profuse sweating.  Staff member continued talking to him when he became unconscious again, this time gasping for air and turning pale.  We kept saying his name until he came to again and was somewhat aware of his surroundings.  He fainted one last time.  After this time, he sat up on his own and seemed to be very coherent.  The EMS arrived shortly after and took over.  They said they would take him out to check him out but he seemed to be doing better.  An EMS personnel let us know the patient did tell him that he has fainted from vaccines before.  However, he did not disclose this to us on the PQCF form or when asked verbally.

Had a 101.5 degree temperature all night which went down to 100 in the morning and back up to 101.2 later on the 14th.  I had nausea and extreme pain all over my body and restlessness.  it got a little better the next day but still feels like I have the flu. I had covid back in march of 2020 and was tested for the antibodies at the end of August.  There is a horrific dearth of research on people who have had covid and whether they should get the vaccines. It is disgraceful, and the next time I will listen to my gut which told me NOT to get vaccinated!

                                                Suspected pneumonitis.  Patient presented on day following vaccination as shortness of breath, nausea, and diarrhea were not abating with home management. They had started later in the day after the vaccination.  At ER admission - SpO2 = 80% room air. Nasal cannula was applied and SpO2 recovered quickly.  BNP was elevated so acute exacerbation of heart failure was suspected and treated. However, patient did not improve with diuresis.  Viral workup and bacterial cause workup negative. No acute cardiac events discovered. Patient continued to decline. Transferred to ICU on 3-19-21 to use BiPAP with 65% FiO2 and able to take breaks to 15L nasal cannula. Borderline blood pressures at this time.  Infectious disease, pulmonology, cardiology, nephrology, and critical care anesthesia services evaluated and ruled out multiple possible diagnoses and patient continued to decline.  Diagnostic bronchoscopy on 3-22-21 with BAL lead to patient ventilator dependent with profound hypotension.  Aggressive ICU management ensued.  Bronchoscopy very clean with no real secretions - in line with CT evidence of pneumonitis.  Despite aggressive care and maximized pressor support, patient expired on 3-29-21 when family chose to withdraw care as blood pressure declined again.

                                                In office patient evaluation performed 27 days after patient received J &amp; J covid vaccine at a vaccine site.   Symptoms at presentation were:  4 week history of post vaccine fatigue, decreased stamina, exertion related tachycardia, and dyspnea on exertion.  Patient is a regular exerciser  with a high fitness level. Exam was unrevealing. Lab testing included CBC CMP thyroid profile ESR C-reactive protein Lyme titers and D-dimer.  All were normal/negative.    The reportable lab findings were:  SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG antibody titers were zero on the initial evaluation.  Six days later SARS-COV-2 IgG, IgM, and IgA titers were done at Lab.  All titers were zero.  So 4 and 5 weeks after receiving the J &amp; J vaccine, this patient had no antibody response.  He has no underlying disease process known to me to explain this finding.  My concern is possible administration of faulty J &amp; J vaccine which may have been distributed before the manufacturing error was identified.

Things have gotten progressively worse as I now cannot walk up a flight of stairs without a racing heart and heavy breathing and extreme exhaustion. (FYI, before this I was running 4-5 miles 4-5 times a week). In addition, my doctor tells me that I have no Covid-19 protection based on blood tests.

Then incredibly painful bone pain in the chest - originally thought it was a heart attack.  It is random  and acute pain in the chest / rib area. It varies in duration and length of time between attacks. The pain is so acute it is hard to manage. Also this appears to have attacked my lungs as I am very short of breath and cannot do any exertion. The body ache, incredible chest bone pain, joint pain and difficulty breathing have continued as I finish day 6 post injection.

He presented to my office today acutely with a several day history of increasing shortness of breath.  He has increased his prednisone at home recently and been increasing the frequency of his DuoNebs.  Despite this, he states that his oxygen saturations have been staying in the low 80s.  He has a hard time walking due to the shortness of breath.  He states previous to about a week ago he was doing very well.  He denies any fever.  He denies any known exposure to coronavirus (COVID-19).  In the office today his oxygen saturations were 88% on 4 L. Because of his failure of outpatient therapy, he will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.  This patient has a history of severe respiratory decompensation that happens very quickly.  Therefore, it is medically urgent we get him into the hospital.     3/25/21 Admission HPI71 y.o. male with a known history of severe COPD and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  He came to my office with a several day history of increasing shortness of breath.  He had increased his oral steroids and breathing treatments at home and despite this was still having oxygen saturations in the low to mid 80s on 2-4 L of supplemental oxygen.  In my office he was extremely diminished and had basically failed outpatient therapy.  Therefore he was admitted to inpatient status for acute treatment of a severe COPD exacerbation requiring IV antibiotics and IV steroids.  He was admitted and treated with IV treatments.  He did recover nicely.  However, he was found to be extremely physically deconditioned.  Because of this he was thought to be an excellent candidate for swing bed and is being transitioned to swing bed.    4/5/21 ER Practitioner Note: Upon arrival to ED trauma room I found patient to be in cardiac arrest, CPR in progress. History is that EMS was called to the scene for a patient with chest pain.  Shortly after arrival at his home  patient developed a cardiac arrest.  They followed standard ACLS  protocol and the patient was intubated. Blood sugar normal. As CPR was given, medications were administered consisting of epinephrine and 1 mg in 2 different doses along with 1 amp of bicarb. IV access via an IO. Patient was then transported to the emergency department.  Upon arrival, CPR was continued and oxygen supplied via endotracheal tube with good tube placement verified by auscultation and good sat readings.  Monitor was placed and patient demonstrated initially a sinus rhythm but there was no pulse.  Therefore, diagnosis was PEA and no reversible causes were identified.  ACLS protocol was followed with epinephrine 1 mg IV every 5 min.  He received a total that including EMS, 5 mg of epinephrine and 1 amp of bicarb.  Monitor at this point revealed the rhythm changed to an agonal rhythm.  When CPR was given, there was good results from the CPR.  However, CPR discontinued and there is no pulse and patient had an agonal  rhythm for several minutes, pupils were fixed but not dilated year.  Lungs demonstrating clear bilateral breath sounds when he was bagged via the endotracheal tube.  No external signs of any trauma noted. The patient&#39;s sister is here and she is a registered nurse.  We had discussed management at this point with her and all were in agreement that the code be terminated.  At 1015, patient was pronounced deceased..    ACLS protocol was followed.  See nursing record for medication and vital sign details.   Code outcome: Deceased   CC time 20 minutes.

Pt also stated he wasn&#39;t having any trouble breaking, skin tone look normal, pt was able to communicate with no problems. He stated the symptoms he was experiencing were something he was used to. It happens to him when he eats chicken  and certain kinds of foods (especially seafood/shellfish). I offered him benadryl and an ice pack while he was here. He refused the ice pack, but did  agree to low dose of benadryl. He took one Allergy Relief 25mg softgel and then continued to set for a little over 30 minutes total before he said he was fine and left with his wife.  I contacted him around 11:50am, he was doing fine and enjoying a good lunch.

                                                My father received his shot on March 13, 2021.  He drove to move home and on March 28th started having his right arm go numb but did not tell us.  He asked to go the ER March 29th at 6:45am saying his chest hurt and was having a hard time breathing, this has happened before since having Covid in September.  I called 911 after he became dizzy and could not walk.  While at the ER suffered a massive stroke that paralyzed him from his nose down over a course of 3 days.  His brain stem was affected and he lost the ability to swallow.  After being on a ventilator for 72 hours he was removed from it and died less then 30 mins later from drowning in his own saliva on April 1, 2021.

During the day, while ambulatory, vertical or sitting, my breathing is normal.  As soon as, immediately, when I get into bed for sleep, my breathing is immediately restricted so I cannot maintain lying down.  I have to sit up.  I can&#39;t sleep.  I get exhausted by 3-4-5 a.m. and finally am so distressed I sleep in a sitting up position or catch a snippet of sleep up to an hour or so.  Often wake up with panic attack of suffocating, sit up, jump out of bed, get vertical.
