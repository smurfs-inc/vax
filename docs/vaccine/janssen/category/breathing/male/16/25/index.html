Severe headache, chills starting and began asthma symptoms (wheezing) at 11;30pm the night of the injection.. 2 extra strength Tylenol did not help. He was very cold and the headache did not let up after several hours.  Eventually he had a bout of sweats and he reports he was soaked.  In the morning, at 8 am the headache was still severe...was sensitive to noise, light and touch. He was given 2 extra strength Tylenol at 8 and then 2 Advil at 10am, which finally began to reduce symptoms. He was not hungry, felt weak, and finally by late night he was feeling better.  In the morning on Saturday he awoke with a swollen left eye and blood shot in that eye.

                                                Patient was given vaccine and was told to wait in the monitoring area for 15 minutes post vaccination. Shortly after, the patient reported &#34;feeling pale&#34; and was told to remain seated. The patient then fell over from the chair and lost consciousness. We immediately called 911 and went to the patient&#39;s side with epinephrine. However, he recovered within seconds and was able to sit up and drink water.  He reported feeling &#34;pale [...], weird [...]&#34; and said he felt like his &#34;ears are sweating.&#34; He did not want epinephine and remained seated and responsive. When asked, he said he had never received any adverse reactions to any vaccines in the past. A pharmacist then cleaned and disinfected his right temple that was bleeding, which he seemed to have hit when he fell. He later reported feeling chest pain and slight difficulty breathing but did not want epinephrine at that time. Emergency services arrived about 20 minutes after and assessed the patient and removed him in a gurney.

Tuesday after the vaccine I got diarrhea with constipation along side the fatigue. Those symptoms lasted throughout Thursday. Friday night after the vaccine I got small haves around my head, neck, and upper back that would not away after an hour or two. That continued throughout Saturday and midday trough Sunday. Sunday I had shortness of breath after moving some water bottle cases around and lightheadedness along with the small hives at around 2pm I went to the ER to get checked out. Doctors said it was a reaction caused  by the vaccine. They gave me Benadryl for the reaction and injected me with a &#34;Steroid&#34; to the my upper buttock. I don&#39;t remember the name of what they injected with me. It is now Monday April 19th a day after the ER and I feel much better. The Benadryl made the  hives go away.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At 11 PM the night of the vaccine (Saturday), extremely bad chills, fever and weakness set in almost immediately. I could not get my body to warm up and was borderline too weak to walk. Very bad headache and nausea set in as well.  After several hours the chills turned to intermittent sweating/cold and I could not keep a consistent body temp, nor sleep that night. The next morning  (Sunday) I had very bad aches and soreness, along with chills/fever and headaches that could be managed fine with around the clock acetaminophen. Around 8 PM that night, most of these flu like symptoms subsided. The following morning (Monday), still very exhausted despite a full 10 hours sleep. Tiredness and weakness lasted through the day. Tuesday morning until around 3 PM i still experienced drowsiness and was unable to gain strength for anything more than typical day to day tasks (could not workout). Wednesday morning, felt normal but while exercising experienced shortness of breath almost immediately as well as chest/lung pain easily. Come Thursday I feel 90% normal.

                                                At roughly 6 days after vaccination my body developed Hives head to toe. Roughly 18 or so hours after initial hive development I sought treatment for a anaphylactic reaction in my throat and face area. I received a steroid and a Pepcid to calm it down, and was given an epi pen and sent on my way. The following now two plus weeks since then I&#39;ve had episodes of dizziness, shortness of breath and headaches that seem to be constant. There has been almost no relief from these symptoms, however the rash has completely resided. I&#39;ve taken an Aspirin in the mornings to deal with the headaches but strenuous activity seems to bring these on much more prominently.

                                                A week and a half approximately after the initial vaccination of the J&#43;J covid vaccine I started having a course of strange symptoms. Insomnia, inability to focus on things directly in front of me (a hand in front of my face would go out of focus automatically after a second), blurred vision, short term/long term memory loss, severe emotional issues, difficulty breathing, anxiety. Shortness of breath at a certain point was so bad I thought I was not going to make it. One very troublesome symptom that culminated after weeks of 4 hours of sleep was that my brain started feeling &#34;funny&#34;. The best way to describe it was a brain &#34;orgasm&#34; which I have never experienced before. At the same time I experienced dry heaving for several minutes, and severe shortness of breath. After this experience my symptoms gradually improved over the next week or two. Prior to this it felt like my brain was not getting enough oxygen/blood, which could have been feeding my insomnia. When I would try to sleep, I would wake up at 4 am gasping for air, as I felt like my breathing was labored when sleeping. I could not focus on my computer screen to do my job at home. Large amounts of melatonin seemed to help my brain feel better and get some rest. I took hydroxyzine for unrelated reasons prior to the vaccine injection as needed, however not too often. During  March I did not take it, as I had experienced disruptions in circadian rhythm due to the medication. I feel it is possible I had a blood clot that has been described in the news, although now there may be no way to know for sure. I talked with  my primary care physician about this, and he did not think this was the case because I was male. However I have a BMI of 18.7 and some issues females have such as TMJ and inability gain weight/anorexia diagnosis when younger. I also was recently diagnosed with an only recently described actual medical issue called R-CPD, which is the complete inability to burp or belch. I felt like during the time when I experienced the side effects, that this condition was heightened (bloating/loss of appetite). I lost quite a bit of weight during March, I usually weigh 135-140, and was down to 115 at a certain point. I am now back up to 130.   I now take sertraline at 1/4 pill dosage to treat the anxiety I experienced as a result of these symptoms as well as some other personal issues. I experienced severe side effects from the sertraline taking it at full dosage, and still experience some at 1/4 pill dosage.

About 5 hours after that I got chills that made me shake all over because I got a fever of 103. Then 2 hours later my heart started to beat very rapidly and got up to 126 beats per minute, my heart was also not only beating vast but very very hard. Then throughout the night and all of the next day, I had pain in my chest on the left side and also pain in my rib area on the left side. The pain lasted for over 24 hours and because of that I went to the emergency room. It turned out they didn&#39;t find anything life threatening at the emergency room but all the pain I had was very scary and very uncomfortable. It was a terrible experience and because of it, I am telling people not to get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.
