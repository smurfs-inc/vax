It got to the point within 2 weeks that he was not able to get up from the chair due to the shortness of breath.  By 4/1/21 he was not able to breath very well, but continued to stay home.  Then by 4/12/21 he was not able to breath well at all and his wife took him to the ER.  In the hospital they did x-rays and found out that his lungs are full of blood clots and both legs have blood clots in them.  He was admitted and gave him Heparin drip for the 2 days to get the blood clots dissolved and was also on oxygen for 2 days.  He was discharged home yesterday with Xarelto, and was told that he would be on that for the rest of his life, and is on oxygen for sleep and when he&#39;s up and around, but if he&#39;s resting and feels he&#39;s breathing okay he can remove it.   They informed him that it would take approximately 2 months for all the blood clots to dissipate, and that he was full of blood clots, and had both legs and both lungs which are quite full.

He should be on lifelong therapy given 2nd VTE and severity.  Iwould consider unprovoked (COVID in 11/20 wouldn&#39;t count I wouldn&#39;t think).  He was started on eliquis 10 mg BID x 7 days than 5 mg bid. Given his severe pulm htn on TTE, left atrial pressure normal.  We would have outpatient sleep study as well He will need VQ scan to assure no CTEPH. Will have outpatient follow up. We discontinued his aspirin on discharge as well.

                                                Per Regulatory Authority it is to be reported if patient gets COVID if fully vaccinated.  Per MD note 1.  Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure:  This is in a patient with COVID pneumonia.  The patient was placed on supplemental oxygen.  The plan is for the patient to use supplemental oxygen with oxygen by nasal cannula up to 6 L and if oxygen saturation falls below 90% on 6 L oxygen by nasal cannula, he will be transitioned to high-flow oxygen.  However, if he is on maximal support with high-flow oxygen with oxygen saturation falling below 90%, the patient should be placed on BiPAP and transferred to the ICU.  The patient is a full code. 2.  COVID pneumonia:  This in a patient who apparently received his Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine 3 weeks ago.  The patient started on treatment with remdesivir.  He will get steroids.  He is prescribed Tessalon Perles and Robitussin with codeine as needed for coughing.  He may be considered for potentially other treatments in the setting of his COVID pneumonia, especially if his respiratory status deteriorates.  We will closely follow up in the COVID unit after admission. 3.  Alteration of mental status and encephalopathy:  This in a patient who is hypoglycemic.  However, part of his encephalopathy related to his COVID infection and volume depletion.  He is being volume repleted and treated for his condition.  He will have frequent neurologic checks done after admission. 4.  Generalized weakness and deconditioning:  This is in a volume depleted patient with COVID.  His COVID will be appropriately treated and he will be volume repleted.  He will need to work with physical and occupational therapy towards the end of the hospitalization. 5.  Congestive heart failure, systolic plus diastolic dysfunction:  The patient does not have any evidence of acute congestive heart failure at the moment.  However, we will take care to prevent volume overload in this patient, who requires volume repletion in the setting of his volume depletion. 6.  Volume depletion:  The patient will get another liter of IV fluids after admission at 80 mL per hour as tolerated.  The goal is to avoid excessive IV fluid administration in this patient with COVID pneumonia.

At 12:30 am on 4/3/21 his mouth was very swollen and he couldn&#39;t talk. Also he had trouble breathing. He went to the ER and was given IV solu-medrol. Patient was sent home 30-40 minutes later with the instructions to take Benadryl PO. In the morning they purchased some benadryl and gave it PO every 4-6 hours all day Saturday, 4/3/21. On Sunday, 4/4/21 at about 5:30 am his gums and lips were swollen again. He made another trip to the ER and was given solu-medrol IV again and PO methylprednisolone for 5 days. At this visit, they also gave lasix IV due to extra fluid around his heart. He was told by the ER provider that he developed congestive heart failure due to the vaccine.  Patient followed up with his primary care provider on 4/8/21 and was told that his symptoms of congestive heart failure had resolved. Patient also reported his  symptoms of swollen gums and mouth had resolved at this time.

No concomitant medications were reported.  On 02-APR-2021, the patient experienced gum swelling, teeth and gums started hurting, trouble breathing. His tongue and throat did not swell. On 03-APR-2021, the patient visited the emergency room (ER) about 12:30am and was given Solumedrol intravenously and was sent home advised to take Benadryl. The patient took Benadryl 4-6 hourly all day on 03-APR-2021. The patient visited the ER again on 04-APR-2021 about 5:30 am with swollen gums again and was informed that he had fluid around heart and given Lasix. Emergency department (ED) HCP told patient that the vaccine gave him congestive heart failure (according to patient) and he was given Solumedrol at ED again and sent home on Medrol dose pack. On Monday 04-APR-2021, the patient visited his primary care physician and congestive heart failure had resolved.  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from events of gum swelling, teeth and gums started hurting, had trouble breathing an unspecified date in Apr-2021, and from fluid around heart, and congestive heart failure on 05-APR-2021.

                                                The day after the vaccine, he noticed he didn&#39;t feel well.  Tired,  headache, stomach ache, and shortness of breath.  This started out mild and as the week went on got worse.  Symptoms were leg swelling, shortness of breath, persistent stomach pain, headache, and chestpain.  On 6/24 at 3:30 am he went to the ER where they discovered a large (golf ball size) blood clot in his right lung.  He also has been diagnosed with pancreatitis.  We have talked to five different doctors and multiple other hospital staff who all say it is a direct impact of the covid vaccine.

                                                Patient caregiver reports that he woke up at 2 a.m. the morning after the vaccine unable to hold his urine which is unusual for him.  He also reported extreme acid reflux symptoms whenever he attempted to drink any fluids at that time as well as nausea.  This progressed to difficulty breathing at which time the caregiver was alerted and checked his blood pressure.  This reading was 88/55 according to the caregiver and the pulse was very high as well but the actual number could not be remembered.  The difficulty breathing prompted them to alert emergency medical services where he was picked up and transported to the emergency room via ambulance shortly after for evaluation.

Given his underlying COPD and requirement for supplemental O2, he was started on Dexamethasone 6mg daily for a 10 day course on admission, which is to be continued after discharge. He had Remdesivir added for 5 days as well as CAP coverage with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for 5 day course. His oxygen requirements increased from 3L to 6LCT

Rapid decline began about 2 weeks after receiving vaccine. Death would likely have occurred on  5/6/2021 or 5/7/2021 but for hospital intervention via use of a BiPAP machine. Patient had been exhibiting more mild, non-COVID respiratory distress for some time, back to at least late 2020, and likely at even lower levels for several years prior. Signs and symptoms included shallow breathing, extreme fatigue, difficulty or inability to lie down, occasional lightheadedness, etc. Oxygen saturation levels in April, as measured by a pulse oximeter, ranged from about 87%-96%. On May 6, it measured 65% just prior to ER visit.
