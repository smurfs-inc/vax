About 5-10 min later my heart rate became very fast very quickly and it became more difficult to breathe. I was driving home at the time, had to pull over and wait a few minutes until the event subsided. I debated contacting medical help, but i began recovering and was able to continue driving. Since the event i have been feeling slightly fatigued and i have a slight feverish feeling, but in general have been able to rest and have not had a repeat occurrence. I received no medical attention or treatment.

I went for a walk for about 40 mins started to feel worse. I had body aches throughout my back and chest and in both arms, was freezing. Tried to eat dinner but couldn?t, too much pain and increased nausea. Tried to lay down, but began having a fast heartbeat and fast/some difficulty breathing. The pain in my chest was the worst pain I?ve ever felt. Continued feeling horrible with a fever of 100.7, nausea, headache pains throughout chest back and arms, freezing, and my arms and legs felt like they were becoming numb. Could not stand, very dizzy, tried to sleep through it. I threw up around 11 and did so a couple more times after that. Was finally able to sleep and woke up feeling much better. Arm is still sore at the injection point.

Three to five  minutes after administering the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, I asked the patient if he is feeling ok because he seemed nervous and sweaty. He responnded &#34;yes, but I have a mental anxiety from vaccines, needls, doctors&#34;. one minute later he started complaining of pain in his left arm and feeling weak. . He then asked to sit on the floor and said that he can hardly breath, and lost vision. I administered Epipen injection to his left thigh while the store director was calling 911. He then complained about not being able to move his hand fingers. The ambulance came and took him to the ER. later in the day, his manager said that he spoke to hid family and they told him that he has been having anxiety from doctors, needls, and shots ever since he was little. He is feeling better now and the hospital will keep him for tomorrow.

Within 5-10 minutes, I was sitting in the car and sending a text and with no warning whatsoever mid-text lost consciousness, profuse sweating, wheezing, lost color in my skin, was making unintelligible noises, and eventually woke up about a minute later but couldn&#39;t speak or comprehend those speaking to me (according to my wife who was terrified).  I was not nervous, stressed, or scared of receiving a vaccine. I regained the ability to speak about a minute later and my wife had summoned the staff on the scene who instructed me to lie back and breathe without a mask. I drank some liquids. A nurse was called over and offered to take my vital signs but I decided I felt ok enough not to. Eventually my normal skin color and came back and sweating stopped after about 5 minutes. We sat for a few extra minutes and once I felt it was past me,  my wife drove us home.

                                                I had extreme chest pain on the 24th of March. It really hurt to breathe and it felt like I had pressure on my chest. I went to the Emergency room and they did a chest x-ray and a Covid-19 both of which were negative. I went home and I returned to the ER because the chest pain became worse. The chest X-Ray the second day showed I had pneumonia. I was told that it could have been from the Covid-19 in December or if was community acquired.  I was prescribed with antibiotics and discharged. I still feel some chest pain  after about a week and I have already finished the full course of antibiotics. I&#39;ve seen my Primary Care physician, my cardiologist and my Pulmonologist.

                                                Patient received vaccine at around 11am.  After waiting around for a few minutes he stated he was light headed.  I went over to observe and gave patient some water.  He was starting to sweat and turned very pale.  1 minute later he passed out.  I brought him to the floor from his chair and he  starting shaking and &#39;seizing&#34; for about 10-15 seconds.  We used pressure on his chest to try to &#34;snap&#34; him out of it.  After about 15 seconds of &#34;seizing,not breathing normally and his left arm completely locked up&#34; he came to and did not know where he was for about 2-3 minutes.  After about that time he started to realize where he was and recognized his wife who was assisting.  EMS was called and arrived shortly,  He was lucid and knew where he was and started to feel normal again.  EMS checked his vitals and they were normal.  Patient refused to go to hospital and EMS released him to his wife.  I checked on patient 4 hours later and he had no ill effects and stated he felt just like he did before receiving the vaccination.

                                                Joints began feeling achy and body felt tired within a few hours of vaccination. About 10 hours later body began to feel warm and then within an hour began uncontrollable shivers and aching in testicles followed shortly after by a throbbing headache and pain behind eyeballs. I put on extra clothing and jumped into bed as symptoms persisted. Later in the night I began sweating profusely and removed the clothing. The headache and pain behind the eyes persisted. I also began feeling nauseous and almost vomited when I went to the bathroom. My body was so tired and achy I could barely move. I tried to wake up for work but my headache and pain behind the eyes was so bad I went back to bed for another four hours. I did not have any appetite for the rest of the day.  My headache subsided that afternoon and I went for a walk that night and my body still felt incredibly tired and achy. The pain behind my eyes persisted. The following day I felt somewhat better and could work. That night I went for a jog and my body felt extremely heavy, my joints ached, and I could not catch my breath. My symptoms continued to improve but I have had no sex drive for a week.

                                                I received the vaccine on Wednesday, April 7th.  I was told I had an anaphylactic reaction at the time of injection: I started sweating upon receiving the vaccine, my blood pressure dropped, and I almost passed out. I was monitored for 30 mins before being sent home. Other than some fatigue, I was fine the rest of the day.  On Thursday, April 8th, I was tired but felt fine otherwise.  Friday and Saturday, April 9th and 10th, I felt like I was back to normal and even did some light exercise.  On Sunday morning, April 10th, the left side of my body (side of injection) went numb, I had extreme vertigo, shortness of breath, and blotches that appeared in random places. It didn&#39;t look like hives, but rather looked like strips of red. I didn&#39;t feel like I was having an allergic reaction, but something did not feel right. I consider myself a pretty healthy guy with a healthy lifestyle. I did not feel the need to go to the ER quite yet, but I did have a friend come over to monitor me.  My friend did some acupuncture which helped resolve the numbness and dizziness and some of the blotches, and also mentioned concerns regarding blood circulation and potential clotting issues she thought I was having.

                                                a 31 year old man who received the  COVID-19 vaccine on March 27, 2021 in the  Public Health Department parking lot. Upon arrival and check in, the patient declined any comorbidities and health history but did state that he was nervous. After administration of the vaccine by  NP, the patient lowered himself to the ground, from a sitting position, and had a 60 second tonic clonic seizure. Seizure precautions such as turning the patient on his side, supporting his head, and calling EMS were taken during the seizure. After 60 seconds, the patient came to and asked what happened. PPHD staff oriented the patient to what had happened, to which he proceeded to say ?oh that is normal for me when I get anxious.? With the help of PPHD staff and his wife, the patient was brought to a sitting position and given a granola bar and water to his request. According to clinic lead RN, ?his skin was normal in appearance for race, ethnicity, and age. He was mildly diaphoretic. He verbalized feelings of anxiety and worry surrounding the vaccine.?   As EMS arrived on the scene and began assessing vital signs the patients anxiety appeared to increase; he became less verbal, closed his eyes, and his breathing pattern became shallow. The patient then had a second seizure at this time lasting approximately 25 seconds. When the patient came to he immediately verbalized, ?I?m good, I?m good, I?m fine?. He was slow to respond to verbal cues, but persistently refused transport to the local acute care hospital for further evaluation. He rested on the ground in supine position for approximately 25 minutes, with his partner and EMS at his side. Upon further evaluation of the patient and his wife, it was determined that the patient has a history of seizure activities when he is nervous and that he was ?expecting? this to happen. The patient continued to decline medical care and transportation to the hospital. The patient left in medically stable condition with his wife operating the vehicle.

They ran CT scans and found multiple blood clots in both lungs, pulmonary embolism.  They put me on blood thinners and transferred me to another hospital.  There they monitored me for a couple days and released me with a prescription for blood thinners.

The next morning, these symptoms had all gone away. A couple of days after the vaccination, I believe on 3/23/2021, I began experiencing unexplained back pain and shortness of breath. This pain was severe at time and I still have a dull pain in my back as of today, 4/15/2021.

We pulled of the freeway and I walked around for a few minutes trying to catch my breath but I was unable to. My wife started to drive and I as I sat in the passenger seat I started getting the chills and all the muscles in my body were shaking. When we got to town I told my wife we needed to go to the ER because I was not feeling well. That is where they did some tests and hooked me up to an IV.

When I returned, I got intense chills and a fever of 103 degrees along with some flu like symptoms. I had a slight headache. Ibuprofen helped but the next day I had similar symptoms, but they went away by the end of the day. On the third day I felt a little better, so I went for a run. I had some shortness of breath and it was difficult to breathe when I was running. I normally run 4 miles daily. The shortness of breath was present for a week after that and also started to happen intermittently even at rest. One week after the shot I saw a doctor and they did some testing but did not find anything definitive. Six weeks after the shot I went to the ER and they diagnosed with Thrombocytopenia. At this point it has been seven weeks the shortness of breath has improved, and I haven&#39;t experienced it for a few days.

I do not suffer from asthma prior to this vaccine. I experienced headaches, fatigue, congestion, my ears were plugged and I also developed a rash on my arms and I also noticed a lymph node in my neck that I did not have prior to the vaccine. When I went to see my doctor my symptoms were not as prominent and the lymph node in my neck is decreasing in size.

I got up to go to the bathroom and upon finishing, I felt my heart rate skyrocket and felt faint. I immediately went back to the bed where I lost consciousness. My wife said my eyes were open and my body was rigid. I came too within a minute of that and was breathing heavy and sweating and very fatigued. My wife had called 911 as I was coming back to consciousness. The EMTs checked my vitals and all was normal. They asked if I wanted to go to the hospital, and I said no. My back was extremely sore all day, and I developed small red spots around my eyes. I went to my doctor later that day and told them about it. They took my blood for tests, which I have not heard back about, and they did not conclude anything, but did set me up with an appointment for an MRI of my head, given my past history.

                                                2 hours after receiving the vaccine I began to feel hot and cold flashes and a flush feeling as if I was going to faint. I went to the emergency room. The ER doctor did blood work, took my blood pressure (a little high at first) and EKG. Doctor said everything appeared to be fine. After I left the hospital I started feeling mild shortness of breath and tightness in my chest which has not stopped as of this writing. I also have moderate pain in the upper middle part of my back by the vertebrate.

                                                Patient was advised to remain in observation area for 30 minutes due to history of breathing difficulty with sulfa antibiotics in past. Shortly after being vaccinated the patient presented to our service window stating he did not feel well and was immediately escorted by the pharmacist to our administration area to have a seat. He stated he felt light headed, flushed (though not visibly), felt like his heart was racing, and was not having diffuculty breathing but felt like he couldn&#39;t catch his breath and stated he thought he was having a panic attack. He had stated before vaccination that he had not had a vaccine since his routing childhood schedule, his whole family had already had doses, and he had been putting it off because he was nervous. He insisted he needed some fresh air several times and was escorted outside by the pharmacist (with emergency supplies and a cell phone and within shouting distance of the pharmacy) for continued obsevation and was given water when requested. After a few minutes he stated he felt much better and the symptoms had resoved. He was directly observed outside per his request for the remainder of his waiting period and had no further symptoms. He was instructed to call the pharmacy right away if he had any additional symptoms after leaving.

Uncontrollable chills also were present.  A severe headache followed.  I took fever reducing meds immediately. Confusion and trouble breathing happened during the fever and chills period.  An attempt to go to the hospital was unsuccessful because I lost consciousness while attempting to find phone/car keys.   After I woke up, I felt less confused and could catch my breath, so I decided to take more fever reducing meds and see how I felt in a few hours - this was around 11pm.  Around midnight my fever broke and the chills stopped, but the headache was at the worst it&#39;s been. The headache lasted the entire next day as well.      I wanted to go to the doctor, but was physically unable to and had no one to alert.  I do feel better today.  I have some weak headaches that come and go, along with muscle aches, but I feel that they are minor enough.

                                                The patient walked in to the pharmacy for a Janssen Covid vaccination along with family. Patient was advised post vaccination administration to sit in observation for 15 minutes but did not comply and as he was walking away from the pharmacy fainted. Parents reported he did not hit his head and pharmacy was alerted post fall of what had happened. We approached the patient as he was getting to his feet and we advised again for him to come back to pharmacy to sit in a chair for further observation. His parents told us he always has fainting issues post any vaccination or blood work (no prior issue reported to vaccinations on consent form). The patient continued to decline going back to pharmacy and as he walked fainted again, he was able to hold on to shopping cart which lessened severity of fall. Pharmacy staff advised him to remain on floor and after he regained consciousness he was able to answer accurately his name, where he was and what day of week it was. At that time a nurse not employed by Company was shopping near by and began to help care for the patient. The patient and his parents continued to decline calling an ambulance, and after several minutes sat against a wall. He was starting to sweat profusely and heart rate was rapid (approximately 145 bpm per nurse) so we had him remove his coat and provided a cool compress for his head and neck. He was breathing rapidly but was able to slow his respiration upon our direction. The patient did not seem to be improving and the nurse helping advised calling EMS which we did. The patient continued to lose consciousness for brief periods awaiting and during EMS aid. EMS ran the patients blood pressure, blood sugar nd ran an ECG prior to taking patient away to hospital (results unknown to pharmacy as we stayed in area to provide information on patient vaccination administration but had no active assistance  care at that time.

By March 30th my heart start beating out of my chest and I felt like I was having a heart attack.  I could barely breath.  Went to get something to eat, walked half way and felt like I would fall on the ground, and returned to my room.  Called my parents because I wasn&#39;t sure if I would wake up the next morning. My team leader gave me a ride to the emergency room. They drew my blood and it was dark and thick.  They sent me home.  Still feel fatigue.

                                                On the evening of 4/8/2021 at around 8 pm I began experiencing an upset stomach (felt like I might throw up) and then shaking in my stomach started and I got a lot of chills and a headache.  Then I spiked a very high fever and sweat like crazy.  I was shaking like crazy and had to call a doctor on call twice.  I had full body pain and was very sleepy.  The fever and chills lasted a bit over 2 days but unfortunately the pain  in my body had not gone away.  Currently (4/14/2021) I have pain in all my joints and my neck and back and I noticed a rash around my right knee. I have felt very tired. I have felt some mild shortness of breath, which may be seasonal allergies (discussed with a nurse earlier, my oxygen levels are 98 percent today, so I am breathing fine, but there is a sensation of shortness of breath) . I have consulted my primary care office about the above and they are speaking to the doctor.  I am trying to limit my exposure to any hospital setting until the 14 days (2 weeks) is up from the vaccine.  Hopefully these symptoms will go away soon and hopefully none are related to a blood clot issue.  We&#39;ll see if my doctor or you guys may recommend a future platelet test?

Per admission note: Patient is a 36YO male with a history of HFrEF s/p heartware 12/17/14, ICM with embolic MI, CAD, chronic driveline infection, HTN, HLD, DM type II, SVT, obesity, gout who was sent to the hospital for bilateral PEs. Patient called our OP line on 04/17 complaining of fever of 102 and chills. He was instructed to go to local lab and get labs done. They drew basic labs as well as blood cultures. On Sunday, the patient reported his fever was gone and he felt better. Today, he was feeling SOB and presented to his PCP. They ordered a CTA which reportedly showed bilateral PEs. They sent him to the local ED who transferred him here. Of note, his INR has been supratherapeutic for several weeks and pharmacy has been adjusting his warfarin dosing. The patient tested COVID negative prior to transfer. The vaccine lot number information is not accessible to this reporter.

Around 7:45AM I started to feel slightly short of breathe, but figured it was just from the cold outside and my Asthma. The shortness of breathe feeling goes away. Later in the day sometime after 3 PM, I start to feel as if I am getting stuffy. I take a nap on the buss on my way home, and when I wake up I suddenly feel like I am freezing and have chills all throughout my body. I get home and jump in a hot shower to warm up, but it did not help. I then heat up some food to eat dinner, and I go to drink some soda, and I notice I have no taste. I figured the soda was flat, but even flat soda has some taste to it. I then drink a Cherry Gatorade, and still no taste. Now I check my temperature and it is at 101.4, and I have a slight cough.

                                                Seven days after vaccine was administered Patient started having symptoms of difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, and breaking out in a rash all over  his torso and upper arms.  His lips also got quite swollen.  The rash eventually spread down both his legs.  He was taken to the emergency room at Hospital, as he was visiting there at the time.  He was given benadryl, and prednisone once his Covid test came back negative.  Blood work, chest x-ray, CT scan of both stomach and chest, EKG and blood work all came back normal.  His resting heart rate was 120 and above, and he required two liters of oxygen to stay in the mid 90&#39;s saturation level.  He spent five days in the hospital before the rash was mostly faded on his torso and his lip swelling had come down.  He was discharged on 3/24/21 with the advice to see his primary care physician, and to be monitored carefully for oxygen saturation and heart rate.  The family could not think of anything he had eaten or come in contact with that would have caused any reaction.  At this time we think it was a reaction to his Janssen vaccine based on all the tests at the hospital coming back normal.

One week ago, on Friday, March 26, he received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine for Covid 19. That day he felt fine. The following day he had some muscle aches. Sunday he states he had some slight shortness of breath, only for that day. Then he had some fever and chills feeling. That resolved. The only symptoms that persisted was his muscle aching and tightness. Then yesterday, the day of his presentation to the ER, he noted some bilateral lower extremity edema which prompted his visit. He is feeling mostly fine except a bit of muscle tightness. BNP was 154. Chest x-ray showed pneumonitis. He received antibiotics. Echocardiogram was completed showing preliminary findings of small to moderate pericardial effusion and trace aortic insufficiency.  Will treat with colchicine and ibuprofen.

The patient was slumped in the chair and then brought to the ground. An EpiPen was administered and 911 was called. The EMTs then came and did an assessment as the patient was able to then sit up. They took him to the hospital for further observation.

                                                On Saturday 3/20 I experienced the usual symptoms that were noted. On Monday 3/22 I began to get very dizzy with a heart rate of 150bpm. My blood pressure went up to 210/138 which is extremely abnormal for me. I began to tremor uncontrollably. I thought it was an anxiety attack so I took my Xanax. .50mg. That did not work at all. I experienced nausea and stomach pain. I called 911 and was taken to the hospital where after 4 hours I started feeling better. Tuesday I continued to have tremors. Wednesday the rapid heart rate, stomach pain, and nausea returned. The rest of the week did not get any better. On Saturday 3/27 I slept all day long which again is not normal for me at all. At this point we are 1 full week into the vaccine administration. On Sunday 3/28 I bagan to have the same feeling as the prior Tuesday. Sweating, couldn&#39;t breath, heart rate hit 170 this time. BP was the same, tremors, stomach pain, nausea, dizzyness, and this time my Carbon Dioxide level dropped to 24. This morning 3/29 I woke up with extreme tremors. No dizzyness.

About a day or two later, I developed a chronic cough that is still currently persisting.  After seeing my doctor on Sat 4/17, I was prescribed an Albuterol inhaler for asthma, which has been dormant for years.   The coughing is continuous, and at times strong/violent.  On the morning of Tues 4/20 I had coughed up a little bit of blood after the coughing had persisted for about 5 or 10 minutes.  Asthma, chronic cough, and  coughing up blood are not typical/documented side effects of received the Covid vaccine.  My asthma has been dormant for years, and prior to this event, I have not had instances of chronic cough or coughing up blood.

He continued to have labored breathing and starting sweating. We were monitoring him and he informed us that it was anxiety related. He couldn&#39;t move his hands and started blacking out. When EMT arrived he started to feel better. They were able to rule out an allergic reaction and it was most likely anxiety related. Patient refused to go to the hospital and was walked out by EMT to make sure he could drive home.

About 20hrs after receiving the shot I started to run a low grade fever floating from 99.5-100.5F; I normally average around 97.5-98F. Thursday night/Friday morning I had the most prolonged fever break I&#39;ve ever had; my entire bed was soaked.  Fever was gone by Friday sunrise.   Saturday I experienced a sever headache, stomach ache and in the evening shortness of breath. I felt extremely light headed. All symptoms cleared by Sunday.   I just drank plenty of fluids and rested as much as possible.

                                                This was one of the worst headaches I&#39;ve ever had in my life. Migraine headaches run in my family so I&#39;m no stranger to them, which is why it is particularly surprising. Along with the headache I had severe flu symptoms - body ache from head to toe, legs toward the end. Abdominal pain toward end. I was breathing heavily throughout, except for an hour or two of bad sleep. It was almost certainly a high fever, but I didn&#39;t measure. Chills, sweating. Complete misery. The extremely painful cycle lasted about 10 hours before it started to recede. I felt better close to 100% within 48 hours. I&#39;m reporting this because I&#39;ve realized that most people have &#34;mild flu like symptoms&#34; while my symptoms were extreme. If I had any other health issues (I don&#39;t) it seems obvious that it could have created a bigger problem. I didn&#39;t go to a hospital, but I should have, in hindsight.

I then fell backwards, and began having a seizure. Bystander said my eyes got huge and mouth and tongue turned blue as I couldn?t breathe. I had a seizure for about 5-8 minutes and was totally blacked out. During the seizure I lost control of my bladder and dislocated my jaw.

                                                Monday, April 12th, around 2pm I started to develop extreme stomach pain, as well as noticed some shortness of breath or elevated heart rate. The stomach pain worsened after dinner. I  assumed it was something I ate, which was the same thing I eat every day, and expected it was some type of gas that would resolve itself naturally. I went to bed in lots of pain. I didn&#39;t sleep well due to the issues and woke up still in pain in my mid stomach, mostly on the left side. I called the nurse who did an intake and advised that I go to the ER (Tuesday, April 13th)

They said I was Healthy just extremely dehydrated it.  My injection site was kind of tender but nothing more. I&#39;m still having issues.

Also I feel it important to note in March of 2020 (before testing was available) I experienced a very similar set of symptoms: fever, chills, fatigue, multi-day headache, body ache, 6 weeks of slight cough, leg pain, and a day a few weeks after the coughing started where I had shortness of breath. I wasn&#39;t tested back then as it was not available. But based on the symptoms I experienced, I truly believe I had COVID-19 last year prior to vaccination.

This occurred for about three minutes, then completely locked up.  Fell backwards and began having a seizure.  No history of seizures prior to this.  Difficulty breathing, completely locked up.  Appears to be a tonic clonic seizure.

                                                The patient returned to the pharmacy shortly after receiving a Janssen COVID vaccine.  He was sweating, pale, clammy, and breathing hard.  We had him sit, helped him calm his breathing; I assessed for wheezing and swelling of the tongue, but he did not have those symptoms.  The patient was able to speak and did not report dizziness or lose consciousness.  Paramedics responded.  I spoke with the patient this morning, and he reports no residual symptoms.
