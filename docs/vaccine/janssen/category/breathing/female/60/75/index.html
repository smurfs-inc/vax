                                                Headache and neck stiffness within 15 minutes of vaccine and lasted for a couple days.  The days after vaccine I had extreme tiredness and felt like I had a bad cold with a lot of coughing and shortness of breath.  I was coughing up a lot of mucus.  The cold like symptoms are still ongoing, 2 weeks after the vaccine, but are less extreme.  8 days after the vaccine I started to have pain at the injection site.  My upper hurt if I touched it.  Twelve days after the vaccine my upper arm hurts if I raise my arm and if I shake my inhalers to use them.  This seems like a muscle pain from the injection site to my shoulder.

                                                Sensitivity started within four hours of dose. Autistic sensitivities to maximum. Scrambling of all senses including proprioception to the point of not being able to move from standing  or sitting. By hour seven, all sensory inputs were too overwhelming to do anything but shut down and sleep. 911 was not an option because they don&#39;t let you sleep, and ERs are overwhelming already, before maximizing all inputs. 7.5 mg hydrocodone for overwhelming pain and sensitivity, allowed sleep. On waking, sensitivity was lessened, but the pain started, 18 hours after the vaccination. Emotional lability for three days. Average aching of arm and injection site were not above expected levels. &#34;Brain fog&#34; and lack of ability to articulate (another autism symptom) started within that first seven hours, and diminished over next ten days. Not yet gone as of today  Dry mouth; overproduction of thick &#39;chunky&#39; mucus that wouldn&#39;t cough out, treated with guaifenesin, lasted three days. Shortness of breath and cough associated with that mucus also diminished after three days. Not completely gone ten days later.   Excessive thirst, onset two hours after vaccine, lasted two days.   Hyperalert (can&#39;t sleep without drugs), hyperactive despite weakness, and hypervigilant (extreme startle reflexes) lasted three days as well. Sleep was achieved with hydrocodone and THC.  All over body pain, feelings of immune mobilization (coming down with) for two days were not above expected levels.   No fainting or other collapse at time of injection, or later.  Knowing that severe over-stimulation is exacerbated in a medical setting, it was decided not to seek medical support for three days of systemic symptoms that would have easily merited hospitalization.

Symptoms began a few hours after receiving the vaccine. She reports localized pain to the injection site but denies redness or swelling. She reports she had fevers for 2 to 3 days, highest being of 101. She presented to the ED on 4/10/21 because of worsening shortness of breath with mild cough and pain in her back.  This is exertional along with pleuritic. She reports she has overall improved from the myalgias but is generally not feeling well and continues to have dyspnea.

                                                I took 1 Benandryl about 1 hour before the injection of the vaccine prior to leaving my home.  My son took me as I would anticipate some type of reaction given my history.  J&amp;J was the one my doctor recommended in hopes that I could handle the response better and only need 1 dose. I had options to get pfizer or moderna, but my dr wanted J&amp;J so I waited several weeks longer to get this one.  Within 10 minutes of having the injection, my  ears swelled up, and felt like I was on a bad plane and could not burst clear.  Then my throat on left side, the same side I got the shot swelled.  My face was full of red and rash and my son mentioned he was concerned how I looked.  I told him my symptoms and then took another Benadryl before we left the store. I told the pharmacist that I was having a reaction, they wanted to call 911-I said please no. I am used to having reactions and would want to see if I can manage it with Benadryl at home.  I came home and took my Alegra (as I take my alegra at night before bed to help with congestion).  Going forward every 2-3 hours I would take another benadryl rotating the time frames and slept as much as possible. It took several hours for the swelling to subside, longer than I was used to.  Over the next several days, I would have times when my ears, throat would swell, my face would be red and rashed, especially at night my face will get red, rash and ears and throat swell late at night. It waxes and wains depending on how I feel.   After the main allergic reaction of 12-24 hours later, I stared with the COVID symptoms, fever, chills, body ache, the joints that I have trouble with hurt so much more (knee, foot, arms, hands) I was so thankful I did not catch COVID. I don&#39;t think I would have survived. On Friday, March 19, 2021 was the first day I started to feel better except for the late night episodes of allergic reaction. I take Alegra or when needed Benadryl. It seems to lower my swelling response.

                                                Patient asked if she could get an inhaler for her asthma filled while she was waiting after her vaccine.  It was determined that the patient had not had any medications for asthma filled in over 3 years.  We contacted two pharmacies that she normally used.  Patient then said she was having asthma like breathing - and that she&#39;s been having issues but had not seen a PCP in a long time.   I then called the Police dept and asked for EMT to come to our site; patient kept saying she didn&#39;t want us to call 911.  EMT arrived, gave her oxygen, and patient was refusing to go to the hospital.  She then changed her mind and decided to be transported to the Hospital.  While these events happened after vaccination, it is likely that patient&#39;s issues are from not treating her asthma.

Everything hurt, even taking a step, I just felt bad, tired like the flu but no respiratory issues. By the 14th I started getting short of breath, couldn&#39;t walk without SOB, my legs started to swell, joints were sore, I felt tired. Went to the doctor and my blood pressure was high, I was prescribed medication for my blood pressure and fluid pills. It hurt just to brush against the skin on my calf.

                                                By 6pm, I started feeling feverish, with chills, nausea, chest pains and abdominal pain. I also experienced headaches and my fever got up to 102.5. I went to the ER and they gave me fluids. I was told it was a reaction to the vaccine, but my paperwork said upper respiratory infection. My cough started out dry, I had SOB, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea and joint pain. My PCP put me on a steroid and an antibiotic Keflex (500mg, 3 times a day). I get lightheaded just walking around the house. I&#39;m still experiencing SOB, fatigue and the cough. Today is the first day that I could get up an move around. I&#39;m fine when I first wake up, but I eventually feel depleted.

She called 911, EMS did full evaluation on her (vitals included) and said maybe she was just having an anxiety attack.  EMS instructed her to take Benadryl. Patient did not want to. Patient called pharmacy and explained symptoms to me, the pharmacist who administered the shot.  I told her it sounds like it was related to the vaccine and that I would report her reaction to VAERS. I told her it might be a good idea to take Benadryl.

I started having shortness of breath and chest tightness. I acknowledge that the shortness of breath could have been due to panic, but the allergic reaction came first and was most definitely real. I also have muscle twitching on my left hand, which started after the shot. I&#39;ve had it now for 28 hours. I got the shot on my left arm.

This pain was not severe unless I took a deep breath.  I was able to go about my daily activities.  Today April 13th still a little tight in my lung but do not have the pain in my back that I had the last few days.

                                                Right after shot, did not feel anything that morning till around 5pm I started to feel feverish, headache, tired.  My arm never got sore or swollen.  AFter 5pm till, the feverish feeling and hot cold got worse as time went by and I started shaking uncontrollably - pretty severe.  I took Tylenol early hoping to stop the achy feverish and shaking but did not seem to help.  THis went to till about 1am or 2am when I could finally lay down and try to sleep.  The shaking had stopped.  I did take more Tylenol and drank some herbal chamole type of hot tea.  I could not sleep that night.  Next day I was exhausted, body aches and still had some feverish feeling.  By the way, took my temperature and it was normal.  Then on Wednesday, I believe is when I had a huge episode of diarrhea (came on sudden).  I kept calling and talking virtually to the doctor telling him all of what was going on.  The next day I the feverish feeling and body aches and being tired kept happening  - adding headache getting worse.  I kept taking Tylenol.  Seem to help some but did not take the pain away. EAch night , I could not sleep due to the headache.  I started to feel better but then on the weekend, I had that headache and tired feeling.  The headache was getting stronger and it circled my whole head and both shoulder and around my neck.  It scared me because I felt at times that my throat was getting smaller.  I could still swallow but it was so strange.  I kept putting heat packs and ice packs and taking Tyelnol.  I know that on Thursday or Friday the week, the doctor told me if I wanted to to go get tested for Covid and I did.  I was tested negative on both the quick test and the other test that takes longer.     I had that headache, sinus tension pressure for quite a few more days.  Overall it took 7 days. I had to take off  most of the week from my telework job because I could not function.  I also did not eat much and drank lots of water during this time.  It seem to go away and then about a week later, I got this painful diarrhea out of the blue and went to see an urgent care doctor.  They tested me for blood, urine, and stool and they were negative.  I was also having pain on my left side.  Then it seem to go away after I was on the BRAT diet for a few more days.  Then the diarrhea happened again the next week or so.  This week, as of yesterday, I got a very strange throbbing pain in my left hand and not sure where that came from.  It can be extreme at times.  I tool Tyleonol but the pain is still there.  Also, during this time and before the shot, I got a trigger finger issue on my right index finger.  I don&#39;t think that has anything to do with the vaccine.  Please note I have been told my doctors and I know this for a fact, my body is super sensitive to food, meds.  I don&#39;t usually get the flu shot because of that.  Today I am experiencing the left hand pain and now metal tasting in my mouth.  I am about 5 weeks out from the vaccine.  I wish I had never taken it.  I pray nothing more will happen  in my body  If I have left anything off it is because I did not write this down when was happening.  I really thought I was going to die one night because of the pressure I was having in my head, neck and shoulders.   I have a little bit of a headache now and told my PT doctor that if I needed to know, I could get a brain or some kind of scan to see if I am hainvg any issues. I am going to bring this up to my virtual call today.

                                                Fingers on left hand began tingling around 30 minutes or so after shot.  While riding home in the car, both the numbness, heaviness feeling in my arm and the tingling worsened.  Then a strong sensation went up the left side of my neck and into the left side of my face where my face started tingling.  That was so powerful and unexpected it caused me to gasp and grab the side of my neck.  My husband turned the car around and we returned to the hospital where they took the information and had me sit for a while checking back a few times.   My arm, fingers, neck and face continued to feel numb and heavy with my face and fingers tingling.    After no improvement and some escalation as it ebbed and flowed, I had an April 12 appointment with Dr at Medical Center.  Some blood work was done afterwards.  A PT appt. is set for April 29th.  It has been more than two weeks now and unfortunately, the numbness, heaviness and tingling continue.

Her blood pressure was 174/86 and her pulse was fluctuating in the mid-high 80s. I administered 1 tablet of diphenhydramine (25mg) and 1 dose of the 0.3mg epi-pen. After about 7-10 minutes, she said her symptoms started to level out and were no longer getting worse. Her lip swelling started going down by the time EMS arrived. I continuously checked her blood pressure, heart rate, and heart rhythm while waiting for EMS to arrive and take over her care. They took her to the closest emergency room for continued monitoring.

I thought it was my N95 mask so decided to head to the car after my 15 minute wait period was completed.  After sitting down in the car I started the following symptoms:  shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, swelling of face, dizziness, weakness.  I sit in the car for approximately 15 minutes then headed home.  I had a driver (thank goodness).  I continued to have symptoms and what felt like elevated blood pressure (I did not have access to a pressure cuff).  After resting at my driver&#39;s house for about 5 hours I felt better and headed home.  The next morning the symptoms were less but still present.  In addition I had a slight rash on my stomach that wrapped around my back.  After approximately 48 hours all of the symptoms subsided.  My blood pressure had returned to normal also.  All swelling went down.

                                                One week after my vaccination, I had what I thought was an asthma attack. I used my inhaler and it eased the symptoms for a short while, but I had to use it again a short time later as my breathing was a bit labored. My chest tightened up and it was hard to take deep breaths. From that date on, I have had tightness in the lungs and it hurts to breath deeply. It is getting so I am tired now after having this issue for the past 10 days or more. It seems to come and go and is not constant, but it does happen every day since March 10, 2021.

The Pt states that she has had anaphylaxis in the past to Macrobid, Sulfa, Amoxicillin. She has an Epipen at home but states that she has never had to use it because her symptoms develop slowly. In the past she has driven herself to the ER where she has received breathing treatments and observation. Pt denies swelling of the eyes, tongue, throat tightness, difficulty swallowing, itching of the skin, SOB, CP, nausea or vomiting. She also denies dizziness, lightheadedness, or vision changes. The Pt also has a Hx of meningioma and SVT s/p ablation.   Suspicion for anaphylaxis high due to lip swelling, wheezing, and previous episodes of delayed onset anaphylaxis. Pt drove herself today so IM injection of diphenhydramine was delayed. Upon recheck Pt?s wheezing was unchanged and lip swelling had not progressed further. Due to past episodes of SVT and no progression of current symptoms, epinephrine was on stand by but not administered. Care was transferred to EMS.  Care was transferred to EMS and Pt was transported to the hospital.

I alerted the person at the vaccination site saying something was not right and then they called the paramedics who took my vitals and said my heart rate and blood pressure was extremely high. They gave me a shot of Benadryl and oxygen because I was feeling shortness of breath. They kept me until about 11:35 in observation when I felt myself again. The headache, nausea and body aches stayed for about 2 weeks but all other symptoms subsided.

Words were slurred, heart beat racing. EMT?s were called. Received another shot of  Benadryl. It did not counteract anything. Received another shot of epi. Had uncontrollable shakes and hard to breathe or speak.  Was difficult to get BP reading due to shaking. Finally got reading of 196/99. EMT listened to heart and lungs. Said all was good. Taken to ER for monitoring of heart, Lungs and BP. Was there for approximately 2 hours u til shakes and BP were good.

On the 12th had severe chest pains which I chalked up to a very bad case of heart burn.  On March 24th, while driving I had two major (what I thought at the time) was panic attacks...body started shaking, heart was beating like crazy, couldn&#39;t catch my breath, felt like I was going to pass out or die.  Had to pull over twice to calm myself down.  (From what I read this could be a sign of a blood clot but I am not a doctor.)  Had minor heart burn until April 5th....which ironically was the end of my 28 days until the vaccine fully kicked in.  Just reporting what happen.  I feel fine now.

                                                Within a few hours of receiving the vaccine, I started feeling nauseated. Since the day I took the vaccine, my appetite has been nonexistent. A day later, I felt very tired and confused. I received the vaccine on Monday and I woke up in a panic on Wednesday morning. My heart was racing, palms were sweaty, I felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe and it seemed like I was having a panic attack when I woke up. From that point forward, I fell into a deep depression. At first I didn&#39;t connect it with the vaccine, but I kept feeling nauseated and then wondered if it was connected. The depression became unbearable and I felt suicidal by the next week. I finally contacted my doctor&#39;s office and had a telemed visit where I explained that I had the J&amp;J vaccine the week before and these symptoms presented themselves afterward. The doctor put me on Zoloft and I HAVE been treated for depression in years past with that; however, I had not taken depression medication for about 8-10 years until this. Likewise, because my doctor put me on an anti-depressant, she also wanted me to see a counselor--which I have done. The medication is helping somewhat but I still don&#39;t have an appetite. I don&#39;t know if the vaccine had anything to do with the depression, but I wanted to report it just in case others have had similar symptoms.

Don&#39;t remember reactions to previous vaccines but not surprised considering allergies. Left side of face felt strange but didn&#39;t look any different when a selfie was taken. Sometime during the afternoon/evening, experienced a headache of short duration. Approximately six hours after shot, experienced chills and low grade fever. Simply went to sleep. Better the following morning, though very tired.  Probably unelated rough itchy patch on RIGHT arm the day following vaccine. Went away with no treatment.

                                                Beginning the following morning after my vaccination, at approximately 8:30 am, I began having severe stabbing chest pains. Feeling as though I was being stabbed dead center of my chest and it came out my back.  I had trouble breathing or felt like it hurt more when I tried to take a deep breath. This was very severe for about 2 hours then eased off  and was off and on for about two days. My arm did not get sore until the third day after my vaccination and remains sore still. I?ve experienced a headache in severity ranging from a nuisance to temple throbbing since the day after vaccination.  I have taken my naproxen for the chest pain and headache.  I ran a temp of 99-100 occasionally but never for a long period of time.  I?m still experiencing some chest pain  occasionally but nothing as severe as  the first two days.

                                                feeling of closing of the throat. Pt came in for covid vaccine. Answered no to screening questions. Was given Janssen single dose. Pt asked MA, what an allergic reaction looks like. I stepped in and told pt. hives, swelling/ closing of the throat, and feeling like you can&#39;t breathe. Pt stated @ 1535 that she felt her throat was closing up a little and that breathing was getting difficult. Pt was speaking in clear full sentences w/o difficulty. I told her to take deep breathes and drink water. I assessed her, she was warm and dry and no apparent swelling of the throat, no itchiness or dryness of the throat. MA brought in BP machine, vital signs were stable. O2 was at 95%. Pt has asthma. I wanted to seek a second opinion on pts well-being, MA went to seek provider that had seen pt prior to vaccination. As MA went to get nurse, I continued to talk to pt about her status. I asked if the feeling was getting better or worse and pt said it was staying the same. Pt was not in distress and speaking in clear full sentences. I told her if her status worsens I have an epi pen to help her breathe better. MA came back 5 minutes later w/o provider  and pt stated her throat closing as she had her hands on her throat and was worried. MA did not realize the urgency of the situation and went back to get the nurse. During this time I asked pt if the feeling was getting worse and pt said yes. I told her I have the epi pen and thats when pt requested I administer it to her. I administered the epi pen at 1554. One minute later Nurse comes in to assess pt. Pt is calm and speaking in clear full sentences. MA takes vital signs and BP is elevated and O2 is at 99%. I inform the nurse that I administered epi and she advised to keep pt for observation, she left to see another pt. Pt was calm and speaking in clear full sentences A&amp;O X4 and stated that the feeling was better. At 1610 Pt stated that her throat was feeling the same closing feeling as before the epi pen. I messaged my nurse supervisor, at 1612 about pt and she proceeded to bring Dr. for assessment. Dr.  assessed pt and told me to call 911. Pt was not in distress and speaking in clear full sentences. Fire dept. came and took over the situation approximately 8 minutes later. Pt requested to be taken to Hospital.

I felt as if my entire body was frozen during the spasms. Had a very hard time breathing. Called 911, no fever, taken to emergency room. Was given an injection of ativan and it relieved the spasms. I slept the rest of that night and woke up very sore in all muscles for 5 days after.

                                                The patient was given Janssen vaccine @ 11:38am. She stated she had anaphylaxis reaction before after colonoscopy was not sure exactly what from. Made sure this vaccine didn&#39;t have PEG in it. Asked her to stay for 30 minutes after vaccine so I could monitor her. Around 12:10pm she said her mouth felt like anaphylaxis may happen. Asked her if she felt like she could swallow she said yes gave her (2) 25mg diphenhydramine. Had her sit and took her blood pressure which was BP 202/101 hr 70 I asked her if maybe she was anxious she said no she was very calm. Around 12:20pm she said felt throat was closing like before told partner to call 911. Got out Epi pen 0.3mg but she had her own administered 1 dose in right thigh. Shortly after EMS arrived and took over. The whole time she was awake and alert and responsive. Spoke to her around 4pm she was just leaving ER and said she was doing better.

I had runny nose, low grade fever thinking it was seasonal allergies until April 5 when my temperatures was 102.  My Granddaughter tested positive on April 5 and so did her mother.  I immediately notified my Doctor that I was positive and his office immediately made arrangements for me to be given Monoclonal Antibody Therapeutics.  I was hospitalized January 2020 with shortness of breathe, pulse ox 72, temperature 104.  At that time I was told I had a virus of some kind but the Doctor in the hospital was not sure what kind.

                                                On the way home I had neurological symptoms, tongue and lip tingling, nauseated. The smell of Lysol spray made me not be able to breath.  Made me dizzy and nauseous. It was like an LSD trip. It like being on a roller coaster, It continued all the way home. I could see all the timbers and bright green colors. Neck was stiff and it crawled up my head to my temples. It was like someone was holding my head. About 3 days later after vaccine my throat started to close and we headed to ER. I took turmeric and ginger to the ER as well as Benadryl.  The symptoms subsided before we reached ER so I didn&#39;t  seek care. I took vitamin E and fish oil  2X everyday after vaccine for 10 days following vaccine.

                                                Right away, they were watching me because I felt like my throat was tightening up a little bit. My blood pressure sky rocketed. Then I was okay after awhile. They pharmacist said to take some Benadryl when I got home if I needed it. He knew I had taken Claritin D earlier. I was okay though. But the next morning, I was so exhausted I could barely get out of bed. The next day, I was still really tired. On Sunday morning, 10th, it hit me - I woke up at 04:00 in am. Nauseous; light-headed; gastro-intestinal issues; extremely ill. I called my brother in and was afraid to be by myself. I could barely move around to even get water or go to bathroom.  I got through it somehow that day and on Monday I was just maybe a little but that isn&#39;t saying much - still severe. By Tuesday, I called the pharmacy - I was so light-headed I thought I was going to pass out and they told me to go to ER and someone took me and doctor said he was seeing a lot of this.  Gave me IV fluids. It was difficult to stay hydrated - they gave me paperwork on what to drink to stay hydrated - Pedialyte - anything that had water in it. I drank Essentia Water, too. I couldn&#39;t stay hydrated and I was so light-headed  (kept feeling like I was going to pass out) that I could have gone to ER again two days later. Doctor said take it easy - he said my body was busy making antibodies. That light-headedness for about a week - but I couldn&#39;t drive for two weeks because of it - was still so dehydrated. I had a strange sensation - like I was outside my body - I couldn&#39;t think straight. I was feeling pain in my back by my kidneys and went to my doctor.

Later at night I had a low grade fever with achiness and headache. The flu like symptoms resolved by morning but I continue to have vertigo and intermittent nausea and my BP was still high in the morning around 9 am but came down by 12:45 to my normal range.  Paramedics at the site did a BP, pulse ox, blood sugar, ECG . Everything was normal except my BP which was 180/90.  This morning it was 167/98 and 168/97.  No treatment.  Saw my doctor&#39;s partner at 1:00 today and BP was back to my normal range but I still have mild vertigo and intermittent nausea.  Doc gave me some exercises to do for the vertigo and did not seem to think that it was related to the shot, but since the paramedics said they had seen a LOT of the same reaction yesterday to the J&amp;J shot and two sites in other cities shut down for the same reactions, nobody will convince me that it was anything but the shot. I expected the flu like side effects but never dreamed it would cause my  BP to spike and the vertigo.

I hardly slept. (all these not worrisome to me) I&#39;m so glad my vaccine provider warned me that with underlying conditions, the vaccine could make them flare up. Which they did. In the morning I had widespread pain all over. Severe headache, and shortness of breath. Because I already have near emphysema hypoxemia oxygen levels, I checked my Oximeter and my blood oxygen was in the dangerously low 70&#39;s.  It stayed there until I put my oxygen concentrator on. Monitoring oxygen levels all day, I was able to keep it in the 80&#39;s to 90&#39;s, which helped.  40 hrs after injection , symptoms already fading away. All my adverse events were related to underlying conditions responding to the inflammation of the immune response. I feel  protected, glad I had the oxygen handy,  and I feel great about the  J &amp; J vaccine!

                                                15-20 minutes after the injection, I started feeling a tightness in back of my throat; I broke out in cold sweat. I started getting dizzy and very whoozy. I felt my vision starting to close in. I thought I was going to pass out. I got the attention of the person across me to get an attendant and they brought me a chair with wheels. Two people got me up (and I&#39;m not a big person) - they were worried I was going down and I was taken to exam room. They said I was white as a sheet. She checked my eyes and throat a few times and checked my blood pressure. It was lower than normal but she didn&#39;t seem really concerned about it - 104 over 60 something which is low for me. She gave me water to sip. She gave me very cold compresses to put on my forehead. They watched me pretty good. She had the epi-pen ready. She watched me and I sat in there and nurse came in a quite a few times to check me for about an hour. About an hour later the tightness went away and I started feeling myself again. We went home. I went to sleep. I woke up at night to go to bathroom and I was still a little woozy but I didn&#39;t fall. Next day, I just didn&#39;t feel well. My left arm was starting to hurt - was no swelling; it was a little red at injection site. It hurt just a little. I was woozy. My eyes couldn&#39;t focus as well. I felt out of it. I drank a lot of water and took a nap.  Yesterday, I felt pretty decent but still woozy somewhat. I tried to run errands with my husband  - just wasn&#39;t quite right. Today, much better but I&#39;m not quite myself yet. Just a little wooziness - weird feeling. Yesterday, I did feel a soreness in the back of my right calf muscle. It wasn&#39;t warm to the touch or swollen. I don&#39;t have it anymore, it went away.  It could have been a muscle thing from the first day of the vaccine when I got home and I got up and almost fell down. I do still have some achiness in joints. Especially in my knees - which isn&#39;t normal because they are replaced.

                                                Prior to vaccination, the patient stated that she was nervous, but seemed relieved and okay directly following the vaccination.  Following vaccination, patient became restless during the 15 minute post-vaccination window about 2-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  She initially presented with uncontrollable shaking/bouncing legs, palpitation, sweating, and shortness of breath (though this was very brief.   Patient remained coherent and oriented to time/person/place.   The shaking and palpitations subsided after a couple minutes and resumed towards the end of the 15 minute waiting period, accompanied by nausea.  25 minutes post-vaccination she appeared to have stabilized, and we assisted the patient to her room nearby at her request to allow her to lie down while being monitored.  After returning to her room, she very quickly ran to her sink due to her nausea, then after a minute of attempting to vomit, she collapsed and appeared to have briefly lost consciousness.  EMS was called and the patient was rolled onto her side to prevent choking in the event of emesis.  Patient remained responsive, but was weak and clammy with a weak pulse and breathing.  After the firefighters came, a search of the apartment found the previously listed medications.  Additionally, the patient experienced a seizure-like episode lasting 15 seconds in duration.  Once the EMT came, they assessed her and monitored her in the ambulance; they reported that her condition appeared stable, her vitals were strong, and transported her to Hospital for observation/testing.

                                                5-3-2021: at 11:54 am got J&amp;J Covid-19 vaccine at Pharmacy. No anaphylaxis or other severe reactions within first four hours. By 8:00 pm began feeling fatigued and generally warm. No nausea or vomiting. By 11:00 pm developed diffuse soreness of left deltoid at injection site, mild chilling, muscle aches, T 98.8. Then developed severe shaking chills and profuse sweating, generalized, systemic burning sensation, nausea, light-headedness. This reaction lasted through the night, about 8 hrs. I spent 5-4-2021 in bed, and started feeling a bit better by 7:00 pm. By the next day felt very weak, light-headed and tired, and a little short of breath with movement. By 5-8-2021 felt pretty much back to normal, but tired. Arm soreness resolved. Reported reaction to my MD.

After she received the shot her leg and shoulder pain/ache increased to an 8/10 (usually a 2-4/10) and was constant when it usually is intermittent.  Her breathing is worse and she is maxing out her inhalers and needing many more doses of her rescue morphine than usual (usually 2.4 ml of 20mg/ml Roxanol used in a week and last week was 7.5ml).  She has not been taking it for the pain for fear of med interactions.  She has increased her Tylenol use from 500mg qd to 3000mg qd.  Her tremors are worse and she is taking her propranolol for tremors 20mg BID instead of her usual 10mg BID.  Her body sweats have gone from 1 time a week to 1-2 times a day.  No fevers noted.

                                                As soon as she injected the vaccine into my arm I immediately felt a burning sensation go down the inside of my arm to my wrist. It lasted about 5 minutes. I felt fine the rest of the day. The next day I developed a burning sensation in my tongue, mouth throat and chest. Then weakness in my chest and dificulting breathing. It is Saturday April 10, 2021 and the symptoms still come and go. The burning sensations mostly at night. The chest weakness and breathing issues seem to be in the morning and when I exercise. These symptoms are not as bad as they were initially but still present. I am unable to get an answer when I ask if the burning down my are is normal when getting a vaccine. No one else that I have talked with has experienced this symptom.  I emailed my doctor she suggested taking tylenol.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included bladder infection, and concurrent conditions included high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and asthma/ bronchitis/ get asthma attacks often. The patient&#39;s other pre-existing medical conditions included that she had no history of heart attack or pain. The patient&#39;s family history included that her mother had bladder infection and lady part infections. The patient was not pregnant at the time of reporting. The patient received Covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 202A21A and expiry: 23-JUN-2021) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 10-APR-2021 around 10;00 AM for prophylactic vaccination on right arm. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 10-APR-2021, the patient almost passed out after she got the shot (vaccination), they (vaccine facility) had to take her out to the car, and she could hardly walk. The patient reported that injector pulled the needle back and put it in again (Wrong injection technique). It was reported that right after injection when she turns around her arm was big as baseball, mushy, swollen and it was painful (injection site). The mushiness was going down, but it was still mushy. The patient&#39;s arm was hard as a marble, redness was still as big as a baseball and she could not touch her arm. On 20-APR-2021, the patient had bladder infection/abdominal pain to groin and had infection from lady&#39;s problem and further stated it as bladder infection. The patient think that the bladder infection was not because of the Janssen vaccine. On 21-APR-2021, the patient experienced hives on the neck and she applied Benadryl cream on it. The patient went to her physician on 22-APR-2021 (Thursday) and Nurse looked at her arm and said that it was perfusion and there was blood clot inside the bump. The patient&#39;s physician told her to take Benadryl and put ice and heating pad on it. The patient reported that she was already putting ice packs 3-4 times a day and heating pads 3 times a day. The patient also showed her hives to her physician and she was told to keep putting Benadryl on it. The patient had a follow up with her physician on 03-MAY-2021 for her arm checkup. On an unknown date in APR-2021 (reported as first night), she could see penguins walking around, marching up the stairs on first night (Hallucinations) and then no more penguins after the first night. On the same first night, the patient experienced nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. On an unknown date, the patient experienced wheezing and she thinks that her wheezing was not related to the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. According to patient her wheezing is related to her asthma. The patient did not have any trouble sleeping since she was taking the Benadryl. The patient stated that she could move her arm up and down, but she was scared to do so. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from hallucinations, bladder infection/abdominal pain to groin, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea, and the outcome of almost passed out, hives on neck, couldn&#39;t touch the arm, blood clot inside the bump (injection site), wheezing, could hardly walk, injector pulled the needle back and put it in again and redness is still as big as a baseball was not reported. The reporter considered the causality between Covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s and wheezing, and bladder infection as not related. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: 20210452551-covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s- blood clot inside the bump (injection site), hallucinations. This event(s) is considered unassessable. The event(s) has a compatible/suggestive temporal relationship, is unlabeled, and has unknown scientific plausibility. There is no information on any other factors potentially associated with the event(s).

I was treated and released the next day.  It reoccurred two weeks before the vaccine and COPD was ruled out. Two weeks after my vaccine I had breathing problems again. I went to Urgent care again with breathing problems and released after treatment. I am scheduled to see a pulmonologist and I am not sure if it is related to the vaccine. I was sick in March of 2020 and I am not sure if it was Covid-19. It seemed to be a mild disease. I have three episodes since I got the vaccine and all tests have been negative for definitive lung disease.

Medicated with Tylenol, bananas, oatmeal and herbal tea.  Documented on pdf form, but unable to use &#34;continuation page&#34;, so added sheet that unable to attach.  Will try again to upload and send separately to this.  NO forms given to me at pharmacy for reporting anything.  I called several times and left messages, but no return call.  Sent email, but response saying unable to help at this time.  Very frustrating as I continued having severe symptoms and unable to get help.  Finally feeling better enough today to send form.

I did not take my Warfarin one day before the vaccine and then two days after on the advice of my doctor. My INR level was over seven without takin my Warfarin for the three days. was It is now down now to 4.5 and I am still withholding my Warfarin for two days and then taking it for three days.  I am going to continue monitoring my INR and withholding the Warfarin if needed as advised by my doctor. I have also been very short of breath since the vaccine. I have also been diagnosed by Nuclear MRI with a lung condition.  My MRI taken three weeks after the vaccine result listed Matched Ventilation/perfusion defect in the left lower lung. I am still very short of breath after three weeks I am on Oxygen now. I had shortness of breath before the shot but it was not as bad as it has been since I got the vaccine.

                                                Sore arm right away and then went to a sore muscle like normal the next day and was sore for three days. What happened next, I had gone to ENT for my ear (5th) and he put me on heavy dose of Prednisone (6th). Following Tuesday, I was on Prednisone for ear. I was already really achy by then. On the third day after the Prednisone I fatigue, headaches and neck pain but I didn&#39;t have any other pain. I still couldn&#39;t hear though.  I was on this for almost 4 weeks and from them I started like I was having a hot flash and then I would get cold; sore throat; headaches heavy bones and achy muscles; earaches; fatigue; dizziness like you wouldn&#39;t believe. They were cyclical - I&#39;d have them for a couple days and then for about a half a day I&#39;d be a bit better and then it would start up again. The fatigues and dizziness didn&#39;t change when the other symptoms seemed to be a bit better. My hearing didn&#39;t start to clear until I went to see the 2nd ENT which was a couple of weeks down the road. I do not have the stamina I had before the vaccine - I&#39;m not sleeping well at night and I&#39;m always short of breath at any exertion. It is improving but it&#39;s slow. Again, the symptoms I experienced during cyclical times: Cold symptoms, runny nose, sore mouth, ringing in my ears was horrible; dizziness and short of breath - cyclical for three weeks. The Prednisone took away all my cramps and pain in my joints that I had before the vaccine. Currently: My heart feels like it&#39;s going 100 miles an hour at night in bed - chest discomfort at night. Legs blue in the shower. The week of the 28th, I was done with the Prednisone and then all the pain came back and more. I can&#39;t take an inflammatory - the pain is still there and my usual cramps came back.

I don&#39;t know when the SOB started but it continued through the month of March. I thought it was an exacerbation of my chronic issues, by Sunday 4/4/20221  I coughed up blood, and on Monday I went to the hospital and had a CT scan and was told I had a pulmonary embolism and a clot in my leg. Now I&#39;m on an injectable blood thinner for the rest of my life and I was told it would take 3-4 months to resolve the blood clots.
