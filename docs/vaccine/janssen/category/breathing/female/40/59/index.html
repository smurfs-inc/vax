                                                patient received Janssen Covid 19 vaccine at our clinic inside store. pt was waiting in waiting area for 15 minutes and she informed us she was not feeling well and felt like passing out. She had been waiting less than 10 minutes.  I went to her and she said she was feeling very strange and was nauseous. I tried to get her up but she couldn&#39;t walk so I let her sit back down. She was not able to communicate with me but was conscious. She said her vision was distorted. her lips started to turn blue and I continued to monitor her. I called 911 and she said she was having difficulty catching her breath so I went for the epipen and gave her 0.3 mg in the outer thigh of her right leg. her color started to improve and she was able to comunicate better. I followed EMS instructions and continued to monitor her until they arrived.

                                                A few seconds after vaccine was given I had a sensation go up my left jawline that felt similar to a nerve pain.  I didn&#39;t think much of it and waited the 10 minutes after my vaccine and had no other symptoms.  I left the pharmacy and started driving home and had a sudden sensation of a heaviness in my chest and trouble taking a deep breath.  I also felt like my tongue and throat were swelling slightly.  I had a warm sensation throughout the middle of my back that felt like a heating pad was on it.  I felt light-headed and called my husband.  As I continued to drive my symptoms worsened and I called 911.  I made it home in my car and the ambulance met me there.  My husband called the pharmacy to ask them what we should do and they said that it would be ok for him to give me Benadryl.  I took 15mL of liquid Benadryl shortly before the ambulance arrived.   Within 15-20 minutes, I felt like I was able to swallow better.  In the ER, I received IV Benadryl and Famotidine.  I was also given 800mg of Ibuprofen for a bad headache I developed.  My oxygen level remained in the high 90&#39;s and my symptoms were much improved after the IV medication.  I was instructed to continue taking Benadryl capsules for the next few days along with Pepcid to keep my symptoms from flaring back up.  I noticed this morning when waking up that the left side of my face as well as my throat felt odd so I took the Pepcid and Benadryl and symptoms were relieved in 30 mins or so.

                                                I suddenly became lightheaded and had extreme weakness, then collapsed, then immediately began having chest pain and pressure, shortness of breath, arm numbness, and uncontrollable shaking. All of these symptoms happened at the same time. We called the paramedics but all my vitals were totally normal. The severe symptoms passed after about three hours. I continued to have chest pain and pressure, but was able to breathe normally and had 100% oxygen saturation. I am not a smoker and don&#39;t have asthma or any breathing issues so the sudden inability to breathe coupled with the other symptoms all at once was very alarming.

I felt clear headed but exhausted for the rest of the day.  My chest has been tight and congested since then. Hard to breath and my voice is rough and raspy. This is ongoing and I still have chest tightness and a raspy voice.  On 4/12/21 I started having horrible joint and muscle aches again throughout my body and felt so tired. Horrible headache and stomach pain, bloating and nausea.

                                                Within 4 hours of receiving the vaccine on 3/9/21 I felt exhaustion, body aches, chills and headache. About 30 hours later I started to experience extreme leg pain/tremors, severe nausea and an unrelenting headache, lower back pain and continued chills. 6 days after receiving the vaccine (3/15/21) I tested positive for Covid-19 and the symptoms worsened. 8 days after receiving the vaccine I developed a cough and sore throat and trouble breathing. 10 days after receiving the vaccine I went to the emergency room (3/19/21) and received a chest x-ray and diagnosed with covid pneumonia and given antibiotics to treat along with a CT scan. Symptoms started to subside about 2 weeks after receiving the vaccine, although to this day I am still troubled with a lingering headache and constant fatigue. Throughout the duration I relied on Tylenol and Motrin. At the hospital I was prescribed indomethacin and ondansetron for pain and nausea.

I also had a headache and fever of 100-102 degrees. I was in bed for three days and I was still very fatigued for a whole week. My hands and legs were swelling off and on. I also had some shortness of breath, coughing and chest pain. I was dizzy and lightheaded. I have been very uncomfortable and unable to sleep. I still have tingling and pain in my feet. I get easily winded and I am still experiencing headaches. It has been almost three weeks. My feet and hands are still swelling and my hands are very red. I am seeing my doctor today for a breathing treatment. Everything seems to be slowly improving but the headaches are still coming and going. I have a weird feeling of bubbles all over.

                                                One day after vaccine I missed worked, was in bed all day with fever of 101.8, headache, body aches, abdominal pain etc.  On 4.2, I couldn?t breathe after attempting a lower-than-normal intensity elliptical workout (I do 60&#43; min elliptical workouts 5x/week and 6&#43; mile walks the other 2 days/week). Following that event I had significant trouble getting a full breath and had dull upper left back pain and very localized pain in upper left abdominal area/lower left rib area that got worse at night. I had a telemedicine appointment with my pcp on 4.14, was Rx?d advair and albuterol. Had another telemedicine with my pcp on 4.16 because breathing and localized pain were more concerning. PCP sent me to the ER. At the hospital ER they found elevated troponin-I and an abnormal ekg (normal chest X-ray and cat scan) and diagnosed me with an NSTEMI heart attack. They transferred me the other hospital where they did more testing.  Troponin-t was normal, ekg was determined to be a normal atypical variant. I completed an exercise stress test and the cardiologist determined that I would not have been able to complete the full 15 min with no abnormalities if I?d just had an NSTEMI so they changed the diagnosis to Acute Myocardial Injury.  On 4.23 lab results showed troponin-I is still elevated.  I still cannot Get a full breath and still have some left back and lower rib pain

The x-ray didn&#39;t show anything however my cbc was of concern and she also did a d timer.  It came back elevated,  so she sent me over for a CAT scan with contrast. It showed pneumonia in my upper and lower right lung and also my lower left lung. She sent me home to try and treat it there. Over the weekend I felt worse and my husband took me to the ER.  Upon arrival my blood pressure was 160 over 120 and heart rate was 140. They admitted me to the hospital for treatment of sepsis and pneumonia and pain management. I was there for 4 days. I was released on the 22nd of April and I am still feeling all of these effects on my body. Headache that I have not been able to get rid of even with the help of  prescription medication.

                                                The first few days, I had flu-like symptoms. After I got the vaccine - my migraines became very severe - they would last for days. They became unmanageable and I had to go to ER.  I have asthma - it&#39;s a lot harder to breathe - this is on and off. It used to be once in awhile I need my inhaler but now I need to use it more. It feels like I&#39;m catching my breath a lot more now.. My rashes went away - but I had had rashes (random places - arms/legs) that came and went for the first two weeks after the vaccine. I went to hospital ER on the 12th of April - because my migraines were so bad that my blood pressure went up to 200 something and they had to clear me to make sure I wasn&#39;t having a stroke. I have always had migraines but the only thing different that has changed the severity is the vaccine. I just finished off the steroids&#39; - Progesterone that the neurologist (at ER)(the one that called the cold stroke) prescribed to me. But that didn&#39;t really help. I&#39;m waiting for approval from insurance for another medication. Saw another neurologist - after the ER visit.

She wakes up at 5:00 AM in the morning for work and on Friday she could not put her feet on the ground for pain in her legs.  She also had a bad headache on the left side and took Advil for that, and then the headache switched to the right side.  She then took another Advil, and that was all she took that day and was that way the whole weekend.  She had pain all weekend and could not touch herself as the pain was so bad.  She also had chills, nauseated, her vision was going in and out as if she was at the eye doctors office.  Her uncle brought her mother over to her as she could not take care of herself or drive to take care of her cousin who she takes care of.  She went to go work on Monday 3/26/21  then she started having difficulty breathing  and her employer called the EMT&#39;s, they checked her heart rate which was high and did her oxygen level which was fine, and were afraid she may have gone into cardiac arrest, and told her to rest.  She called her doctor who told her that it was a bad reaction to the vaccine.   She is still having difficulty breathing after walking so far, she weighs 115# and has always been a small person.  She was not given any medications by her doctor and told her to rest and if it worsened to call her back.    She had been seen two weeks prior by her doctor for a sinus infection and was given an allergy shot and some other injection of which she does not know what it was, possibly a steroid.

Scheduled phone call with triage nurse at 11:15am and then a follow up call again with my primary care doctor immediately following. At approx 1:22pm my primary care doctor told me to go to urgent care or ER due to concern of me going into anaphylactic shock. Immediately went to Emergency Room and admitted after waiting in waiting room for over 5 hrs. After bloodwork and CT Scan of abdomen my appendix was perforated and needed to be removed immediately. Immediately sent to OR for surgery at 11pm.

Pharmacist was asking if the patient is okay and the patient stopped responding so the pharmacist kneeled over to pick up the patients head and she looked flushed, her eyes were bulging and she began to sweat. The pharmacist asked the technician to call 911, asked the patient if she could breathe and the patient said yes but said she is not feeling well. She kneeled back over and the pharmacist was holding her hand telling her to continue breathing. The patient was very sweaty continued to breathe heavily. About two minutes passed and the patient was expressing she was feeling better and better as the pharmacist was speaking to her. The EMTs arrived 7 minutes after the call the patient had sat up already and was speaking and feeling alert.  She expressed that she felt like she was underwater and the pharmacists voice was fading during the minutes after the shot and she felt like her heart was racing. She explained that she suffers from anxiety.  The EMTs took her blood pressure when the patient was sitting and standing up, blood pressure was in normal range and also checked her blood glucose with a finger stick which was also in normal range. The patient had mentioned previously that she biked to the pharmacy. Later on the pharmacist called to check on the patient she said that she is feeling well and biked back home.

                                                Immediately after the JANSSEN vaccine I felt tenderness in my jaw that lasted for about two days. My body was sore, my Legs felt like I was having cramps ?growing pains? I also was experiencing allergy/asthma like symptoms that included difficulty breathing and shortness of breath that worsened over time I couldn&#39;t speak in full sentences or laugh I was unable to walk 10 steps without gasping for air, after a couple of days of trying to maintain and cope with my theses symptoms. I couldn?t take it anymore, as I was preparing myself to go to the emergency room. I got into the shower the steam from the shower felt like it was suffocating me and I passed out my children took me out of the bathtub and rushed me to the emergency room where I was given several tests that include x-ray, CAT scan, artery bloodwork and vein bloodwork. I was being treated for asthma and given several different breathing treatments and steroids, unable to keep my stats at a decent level and the hard rebound even after continuous treatments, I was admitted because the breathing treatments were not effective. I am still uncertain of the ?actual outcome? the Hospital doctors treated me for an asthmatic episode and gave me directions how to handle my asthma i was prescribed prednisone and referred  to my primary that would then refer me to a pulmonologist and cardiologist. At the hospital I was told that there was black spots on my lungs I was told that I was being treated for infection, but then also told it could be pneumonia no certain  answer was ever given and i was given and antibiotic and was also told that I needed to see my primary for a way to maintain my asthma. The antibiotics seem to work for a couple of days and again I&#39;m back to having difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, muscle pain soreness and mild lingering headaches.

My throat starts to swell, it?s hard to swallow. I start coughing profusely.  Later that evening came the chills, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea. That lasted 3 days. On day 8 I had severe pain down my arm. The same as the pain I had before I had my cervical spine fusion. On day 11 I had severe down my leg. Again the same type of pain I had before having lumbar spine surgery.  I?m on day 12 as I?m writing this.

                                                As soon as I took the vaccine shot I had an immediate headache, after taking the vaccine I took Tylenol and slept in the rest of the day. The next day I woke up and my arm was red and swollen. I was running fever, still had the headache and now blurry vision. My entire body was hurting. My left side of my body felt numb and tingling. The next two days the pain became worse. I did not really have an appetite. When I did eat I could barely hold my food down. On Wednesday morning I could barely get out of bed, I also felt extreme pain in my lower legs, stabbing pain in stomach and right lower side. I also had ringing in my ears, more in the right ear. I then notice a bruise on my left leg, that it was not originally there, and was also tender to touch. I went to the emergency room on the same day and I was admitted. I was in there for 4 days, they tested my leg and stated it was not a blood clot, although it look and felt like one. They discharge me and advise me that it was a migraine that was causing all my pain.  This was on Sunday, I had a follow up with my PCP on the Friday, however to being in so much pain and shortness of breath, and arm pain I was advise to go to the ER on the Thursday and was admitted again. I was told in the ER I had a blood clot in my right arm and it was most likely from the IV from the previous visit. My blood pressure and heart rate was so high that they put me on medication. No matter the pain medication they gave me, it would not completely take the pain away. They discharge me again on Monday and after me begging them to get run any and all test, they said they found nothing. I&#39;m still in the same amount of pain and same symptoms, still having trouble keeping my food down. The only thing that changed is my left arm is not as sore, however I still have a huge knot and its still warm to touch. I don&#39;t know what else to do that is why im contacting the CDC for help. I&#39;m in a extreme amount of pain and pounding headaches.  Please help

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine, I felt pretty good. Just some soreness in arm and a minor headache an hour later. I took Tylenol and symptoms were bearable the rest of the day. By around 6 or 7p that night, I experienced full body pain and chills, similar to the flu. I also had some chest pain and tightness but attributed that to the overall body pain. I was also very winded and short of breath. I called my Primary Care Doctor to report this, and she said this was a normal reaction and it meant my immune system was working. It continued into the next day, and I took my temperature and had a 102 fever. I slept most of the day and was unable to work. I also had a severe headache. The next day, on Day 3, my flu symptoms were getting better; however, I felt dizzy and short of breath. I also fainted . This is the first time this has ever happened to me. I have never fainted in my life. My symptoms seemed to resolve after eating and drinking, so I figured it may have been dehydration. On Day 4, I was concerned because I was having shortness of breath and chest pain, along with dizziness. I could not take a deep breath without having pain. I called my Primary Care Doctor, and she told me she was concerned I might have covid and to go to the ER. I do not believe I have covid. No one in my household has these symptoms except for me. I believe it is from this vaccine. My chest pain/shortness of breath seemed to go away. for a bit so I did not go to ER. I&#39;m on Day 5 now, and the chest pain/shortness of breath has come back, so I decided  to report this because I do not listed on the list of common side effects for the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I joined a J&amp;J social media group where others are also reporting these symptoms, so I decided to report to Vaers. I also have had night sweats every day since taking the vaccine and my blood pressure is lower since taking the vaccine.

                                                Right away I started to feel very hot. I waited the time (15 minutes) they recomemnded to stay at pharmacy. I drove home and started to feel nausea, a light headache, and mildly dizzy. I started to get short of breath about 45 to 50 minutes after the injection. I climbed a flight of stairs and was completely winded I was having trouble catching my breath. My lymph nodes in my neck swelled up a lot and I was developing a sore throat and small bumps on roof of mouth. I called the nurses line and was directed to take a 50 mcg dose of benadryl and that if the shortness got worse to call 911 and use my epi pen.  After about 2.5 hours the breathing seemed to primarily resolve itself and resume more normally. I woke up this morning with a very sore arm, body aches, a mild headache, congested sinuses, and with a sore throat. I do feel like I am not tasting as well as normal, it could be the congestion. I do not feel great but only seem mildly winded and short of breath walking across the house.

                                                Thursday 04/08/21 - 1:35 PM Went to Fairgrounds to get the Johnson &amp; Johnson - Janssen COVID-19 vaccine shot with my husband. Both of us wore our masks, walked in together, went through the line together, we both got the shot in our left arms and then set together and waited the 15 minutes before we could leave. A little later at home we were working on some landscape lighting and I felt a bit foggy, light headed and kind of out of it. I was drilling into masonry and the first hole went fine but the second one for some reason just wasn?t going and I touched the drill bit with my fingertip on my left hand to see if it had smoothed out and I knew in my head not to do it and that it should be hot as heck but I didn?t feel anything at all so later that evening when I took a shower my finger was burning and I knew I had burnt it. That evening I begin to feel crippling cold, my fingernail and toenail beds had turned purple and I was shivering violently. I got under a pile of blankets with my dog and  tried to slow my breathing I could feel my heart beating in my chest and it felt like the air I was breathing was cold and frosty. I had a 104&#43; fever that night. My husband got me some aspirin a cold washcloth for my head a popsicle and water to help bring down the fever. And I was able to sleep on and off that night. When I woke up I had a 103&#43; fever and a tingling and numbness in my arms. Before the fever my arms felt tight and cold and I had a tingle that ran from my elbows to my fingertips. Again it was aspirin cold washcloth and lots of water to drink to try and get my fever down.   Friday 04/09/21 Was spent in bed trying to drink water and sleep through it. My arm was sore, not at the injection site but the whole top part of my arm felt like I had been hit by a truck. I had a fever again that evening.   Saturday 04/10/21 I thankfully woke up fever free but my arms were tingling. I had to take my husband to the airport that morning at 6:30 AM. I came back home and went back to bed until about nine when I woke up my arms were cold and sore and tingling it seemed to be getting worse in my left arm and I felt shots of electricity from my elbow down to my fingertips. At one point I took a picture because my left arm hurt so much more than the right and my fingertip beds were purple on my left and pink on my right. I took aspirin and took a nap. I couldn?t hold my phone with both hands hands like normal sitting in bed because my left hand goes cold and achy. Woke up worried that both my arms were aching and tingling from my elbows to my fingertips seems to be where it stays the most. Then that pain subsided and my lip started to tingle. After a few hours that stopped but the tingling in my arms is about constant not as strong sometimes, not in both arms sometimes, it seems to almost always be in my left arm and at one point scary enough that I almost went to the ER. Went to bed around 11:30 PM and the tips of the toes on my left side were tingling and it went to the whole leg.  Sunday 04/12/21 I woke up with a coughing fit  and mucus at around 1:00AM and my right leg with a little tingly at 4:24 AM awake again and coughing woke me had to get a drink and my stomach was buzzing and stopped now just back to the bottom half of my left leg. All of a sudden after a coughing and sneezing fit I got a tremendously sore burning throat out of no where that only lasted about five minutes. I noticed my left arm straining to hold up the pizza box tonight when my right arm had no trouble at all. Then a little later in the day stiffness in the back of my neck. It is a weird strong dry cough and I was scared to go to the ER because my symptoms were so varied and ever-changing I didn?t know what they would do with me and I didn?t want to just get stuck in there for days with him not knowing or making it worse. I told my husband ? It?s so random I?m a little scared no one is going to know what to do with me...?I?ve had issues with allergic reactions and no one being able to diagnose them and me having to figure it out on my own on the Internet that I had Thyroid problems and that I was allergic to the sun for a few years in the past and aloe vera... I didn?t wanna wind up going, them not fixing anything and having a huge bill to pay. But this whole time my body is buzzing and tingling and going through something strange. At this point I am just telling my family I?m okay and what random symptoms I have had since we spoke last. They are on standby to watch my children if I need to go to the ER. The constant buzzing, numbness, cold tingling in my arms is worrisome.   Monday 04/12/21 I am use to the numbness and tingling being a constant thing on some part of my body... There are times when I feel fine but I know it won?t last long. We can add an upset stomach and diarrhea to the list. I had a metal taste in my mouth for a little bit today. Both arms legs and my lips have randomly buzzed, ached or tingled. The websites say call 911 for emergency or call your local medical provider for assistance so I called the local ER to see if they could tell me if my symptoms were normal or if it?s something I should come in for and they couldn?t give me any advice... I was told if you feel like you should come in then come in. I had a very strong sharp pain at my elbow of my right arm tonight that made me sit up in bed...   Tuesday 4/13/21 My left arm is still sore if people touch me or if I try to sleep on my side like I normally do it hurts trying to hold my phone with both hands my arm still goes cold and achy. So far this morning my arms are both tingling and my left leg and my lips so at this point I just say I?m buzzy. 11:25 AM randomly my right arm decided to feel worse for a change but is back to a low buzz... after a few minutes. I find myself holding them up or lifting them when they hurt it seems to help a little to elevate my arms to my chest. I am just waiting to see what comes out in the media, or to see if this gets any better, or if they learn what to do about it... It isnt over, it hasnt stopped yet.

                                                I had - as soon as she gave me an injection - I felt like it was a little bit hot. I told her that. I knew I had a lot of allergies so I was being careful. Within a minute of sitting down, my right arm became swollen and bright red and felt burning and itchy. And it spread across my chest and went to my left arm. The rash or hives continued up my  neck up to my face and that all happened within first five minutes. Immediately after that, I had excessive coughing - couldn&#39;t cough up anything. I couldn&#39;t catch my breath and my throat started swelling a bit. they gave me 25 mg of Benadryl - capsule over the counter - and the 9-1-1 operator advised not to use the epi- pen. Paramedics came - gave me addition 50 mg of Benadryl - and they took me to the ER across the street and I was administered another 25 mg of Benadryl and also some steroid - Solumedrol - and after receiving these - then these symptoms went away. I continued on Benadryl and prednisone for a few weeks - the very next week - I had a large streak that went from injection site to left chest and I had a second red streak from left chest that ran down to my left arm. For two weeks, that burning fire rash would just come. No rhyme or reason as to when or why - arm, neck, chest, legs and sides. And I&#39;d have to take extra Benadryl every time it would happen and I was still on the high dose of steroids as well. I also had - the next day - 24 -48 hours after vaccine - I had a severe headache and it lasted all day long. And about 24 hours after the vaccine- extreme fatigue, body aches and headache and weakness and that lasted for about three days. Fatigue lasted three to four weeks. Joint aches lasted three to four aches. Headaches have still continued. They have almost been worse actually. I had two headaches that I was so concerned about that would not go away - worst headaches I have ever had: one on May 1 and one on May 9 - and I took Maxalt and some Benadryl - the Benadryl did help a little bit (enough for me to go to sleep). Each headache lasted 12 -15 hours and they were the most severe headaches I had ever had. I didn&#39;t have anyone to take me to take me to hospital so I just tried to sleep. I saw my primary care doctor - virtual visit. I took the prednisone for two to three weeks. I still contend with the headaches.

THESE SIDE EFFECTS PROGRESSED AND WERE WORSE 4 HOURS POST-VACCINATION.   THE DAY AFTER VACCINATION, AFTER REGISTERING WITH V-SAFE, A REPRESENTATIVE CALLED A.C.  AND TOLD HER TO TAKE 75 MG DIPHENHYDRAMINE.  THE REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT A.C.  WAS HAVING A MODERATE REACTION TO THE VACCINE (A.C. DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANAPHYLAXIS).  MOST OF THESE ADVERSE REACTIONS IMPROVED AFTER TAKING THE DIPHENHYDRAMINE.   TODAY, 2 DAYS POST-VACCINATION, A.C.  IS NO LONGER HAVING ANY SIDE EFFECTS AND IS RECOVERED.

                                                I began to feel nauseous and shaky within 20 minutes. I was dizzy, but almost more feeling like my thoughts were jumbled and I had a hard time speaking. I began to get a terrible headache and then began vomiting. I was shaking and out of breath. I was terrified because this was something I had never felt before. The symptoms began to fade within 4 hours and then I experienced the &#34;normal&#34; side effects, such as arm pain and tiredness.

                                                Lightheadedness and exhaustion set in 15-25 minutes post injection. Later that same evening, experienced nausea, muscle, bone, and joint aches as well as chest pain that were much reduced by the following morning. Malaise continued as did symptoms of nausea without vomiting.  24 hours post injection, experienced a low grade fever of 99.6 F (for me, this is a low grade temp). Fever broke after another 24 hours.  Experienced severe headaches in the middle of the forehead for 8-12 hours on 3/25/2021, 3/29/2021, 4/3/2021.  Experienced difficulty breathing 3/30/2021. Woke up from deep sleep feeling starved for oxygen and a sensation that a deep enough breath could not be taken--the lungs could  not expand enough. Respiratory rate seemed slightly depressed. It passed after about 30 minutes with focused effort on taking deep, regular breaths. Fell asleep again and did not consult a medical provider about it. The oxygen hunger / breathing issue did not repeat.  Medical professionals were not consulted for any of the episodes described above.

I broke out in buckets of night sweats.  The following 2 days I was generally fatigued and had sniffles.  After that I was fine, until Monday night (Day 10). I suddenly experienced a sudden onset of a painful and raised red rash at the base of my spine on my lower back. Within hours it migrated up to my head, face and then to the front of my torso. My eyes and throat closed. I took benadryl with no relief.  I called Dr. on Demand and they urged me if the symptoms got worse to head to urgent care/ER.  The next day (Tuesday 4.13) I went to the ER where they gave me a steroid shot, and prescribed me predisone and Prilosec to block the histimines.  I am still having rash symptoms,itchiness and burning.  While I have a history of seasonal allergies they&#39;ve always been stuffy nose at the most. We had no new dietary introductions or new habits.

                                                Patient reports: &#34;I received my covid 19 vaccine on Friday April 9th (J&amp;J) and need to report my reactions afterward. Had the usual immediate arm pain after injection along with nausea. Took a Benadryl and napped when got home and woke up 6 hours after injection with a tingling and swollen lower lip and constricted breathing. Took 3 Benadryl in fear of going to hospital and waited it out. Once lip went back to normal as well as breathing went to bed since it was late and slept all day Saturday. Woke up Sunday in agony from lower back pain and tailbone. Now, thurs 4/15 still in extreme pain in my tailbone. Went twice to chiropractor to help and nothing is alleviating the pain and have been practically bed ridden since Sunday. Can?t work, can?t sit, can?t walk can?t stand can?t anything without extreme pain. Been taking ibuprofen everyday and not helping.&#34;   She had a visit with us on 4/15/2021: &#34;Patient here for extreme pain on her tailbone. She had the Johnson and Johnson vaccine about 6 days ago and about 6 hours later she woke up with a tingling and swollen lip, constricted breathing, and dizziness. She wanted to avoid the hospital, so she took benadryl 75 mg and it slowly resolved her symptoms. These symptoms have not returned since. She was finally able to fall asleep that night and then slept all day the next day. The following day she woke up and experienced extreme pain in her lower back and tailbone. She saw her chiropractor twice this past week, which helped to resolve her low back pain. Per patient her chiropractor noted that her back seemed very inflamed. However, she is still having extreme pain with her tailbone and is unable to sit, stand, bend or work for more than 20 minutes without extreme pain. The only thing that seems to improve her pain is laying on her back with several pillows tucked behind and all around her. However, she is only able to stay in this position for a period of time before her body becomes stiff from immobility. She has been taking ibuprofen 600 mg TID, flexeril PRN, icing and applying moist heat to her back, but none of these measures seem to improve her pain. Lastly she has noticed that when she sits/stands for too long, her buttocks start to spasm. Denies fever, chills, n/v, numbness, tingling, incontinence or loss of bowel/bladder function.&#34;

                                                Immediately tasted a metallic taste and numbness in my cheeks. When I got home I had a rapid heart rate and slight shortness of breath. That night I ran a fever of 102 and had horrible chills and nausea. The next day these were gone but I had a horrible headache that even Tylenol wouldn?t get rid of. The second day these symptoms had stopped.

                                                Vaccine administered 10:15am.  Got a headache and mild nausea 12:15pm (2 hours later).  5:15pm (7 hours later) started to shake violently.  Couldn&#39;t walk was shaking so much.  Speaking was difficult.  Breath was labored.  It was so scary my husband called the doctor.  Shook violently with teeth chattering for 45 minutes then would break for a few minutes before shaking again.  The shaking was probably 60 minutes total.  Then fever set in.  Fever hit 102.4 at 6:15pm.  102.9 at 6:40pm.  103.8 at 8:15pm.  Fever ranged between 102.3 and 103.8 for 8 hours after starting then finally broke 1:45am (8 1/2 hours after the shaking started).  Was able to get out of bed 8:00am today.  Massive headache for the morning but no fever today.  26 1/2 hours post vaccine new and I just feel very tired and drained.

Patient voiced that she took Benadryl immediately and the reaction began to subside. The patient also stated that he woke up Saturday evening with a large sized knot on her arm where the vaccine was administered. Patient stated that it has since gone down in size but is still fairly large.

                                                Around 7 pm on 3/13, I developed brain fog, trouble walking, and then fever, severe muscle pain worse in legs, and chills.  Most of these symptoms seemed to improve on 3/14, but then on 3/15, I developed new onset of shortness of breath and chest discomfort.  On 3/16 around 1 pm the shortness of breath worsened and I went to the emergency room.  I felt that I couldn&#39;t take a deep breath in and I had chest discomfort on the left side of my chest worse when taking a deep breath.  My legs were hurting as well, especially my left leg.  I had sinus tachycardia (heart rate 106-120) and increased respiratory rate (rate of 20)  with O2 sats 100% on room air.   My breathing and heart rate improved somewhat with 1 liter oxygen therapy, 1 liter of IV fluids, albuterol inhaler, and decadron 6 mg orally.  It was thought that I had a delayed asthmatic/allergic reaction to the vaccine.  I do not have a history of asthma.  I was prescribed a Medrol dose pack and albuterol inhaler.  My hands and feet are very cold and tingling on 3/18.  Shortness of breath and chest pain seems to have improved but not completely gone as of the time of this submission on 3/18.

                                                I will begin by noting that I am known for high pain tolerance and have been a strong, healthy, professional athlete for thirty years. The evening of the vaccination, I went to bed at 9pm feeling odd. By midnight, I became paralyzed with excruciating pain throughout my torso and arms with such an extreme fever that it felt as if my heart was going to stop. I had crushing chest pain which inhibiting my breathing ability in a way that could only be compared to being crushed under a burning truck. The paralyzation was so intense, with pre-existing pain multiplied by a thousand, that I couldn&#39;t even speak to alert my husband, who was right beside me. This continued for several hours until it subsided enough for me to pass out from exhaustion. The following day I battled residual aches throughout my torso and arms, accompanied by a mild fever. The trauma of fearing for my life that night and over the past week, exacerbated by the news of this vaccine I received being paused for issues related to my demographic, had made me too afraid to report my extreme side effects until now. With the encouragement and support of my family, I have worked up the courage to do so. It was the scariest, most intense pain and fever I have ever experienced in my life all at once and no one I have described this to has ever heard of the severity of what happened to me.

                                                Strange headache began and continued after about 24 hours after receiving vaccine, headache continued and on 4/15 turned into a wrapping tingling headache that included both arms going numb, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and extreme hot flash like sensation.  Continued strange feeling in chest and headache, hospital did CAT scans, EKG, bloodwork and could not find what caused all of the symptoms to occur but noted I had the vaccine just 2 weeks prior with a continued symptom leading up to the ?neurological event? and head that continues after as is still present.  Pain and numbness also continues in left arm.

                                                The evening that I got my shot I felt the common side effects like flu symptoms. I also had a rapid heart rate and high blood pressure. It woke me up from sleep. My blood pressure remained high and I felt pressure on my chest for three days. Five days after the shot the pressure on my chest felt worse and my blood pressure was still very high, I also have shortness of breath when I am moving around which started three days after the shot. I saw my doctor who ran some tests which were negative. I am still feeling the pressure on my chest and the shortness of breath after one week but it is a little better than it was and less often.

On Sunday morning 04-11-2021, I had horribleheadaches and I took a Tylenol but it did not help. On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday I again woke up with headaches and I felt extremely fatigued. I went to see my PCP who performed blood tests and also did a D-dimme test which the tests came back as being okay. I also experienced a full body rash and was having slight breathing issues. I also went to see an allergist on Monday 04-12-2021 due to my whole body rash, patchy skin, red and white bumps on my forehead. I was also concerned because at the inside of my mouth and upper pallet I had red bumps which lasted three days. I took me a whole week to recover from these symptoms.

The next morning I felt the more intense side effects (fever of 101.1, chills, fever,  extreme sweat, loss of appetite, body aches and fatigue).  While the majority of the side effects have passed I still have no appetite.  I am a very healthy adult that does strength training  4x a week, I typically eat and snack every 3 hours.  Since the vaccination day I have no desire to eat and I am down to 2 meals (breakfast and dinner). I am also experiencing headaches and dizziness but this could be from the lack of nutrients.  Because I feel dizzy I am forcing myself to eat as I almost fainted during a morning workout and had shortness of breath. This particular morning I had coffee, a protein shake and a banana prior to my workout.  I have not read or seen any additional information on the loss of appetite lasting this long and I am getting concerned

                                                Three days after the vaccine I started to get a feeling of pressure on my chest. I woke up during the night because it was hard to breath. I had leg  pain in both my sides.  The leg pain lasted three days. I took it easy for the next two days. I called the doctor and she advised me to go to the ER. I was given an EKG and Chest X-Ray and blood work. I still have the feeling of pressure on your chest after two and a half weeks. It is a similar feeling to when I had the Covid-19 in October of 2020. It is not any better or worse than when it started.

                                                Event took place at an off-site event, in a detention facility. Pt received Janssen COVID vaccine around 4:00 pm. Pt immediately reported nausea. Nurse accompanied pt to the restroom about 2 minutes after receiving vaccine, where she gagged into the sink and spit up a little clear fluid. Pt reported feeling hot and sat down in a chair available in the restroom. Pt and nurse joined by a second nurse. Shortly after sitting down pt complained of feeling dizzy and was moved to the floor to lay down. When laying down, pt appeared flushed under her chin and complained of chest tightness. She requested to sit up to help with breathing. Called 911 and first dose of epinephrine (0.5 mL of 1mg/1mL) administered, both at 4:10 pm. Pt reported no change in chest tightness following epi, but continued to respond to questions. She said she felt tired and wanted to go to sleep. Pt continued to report difficulty breathing, and another dose of epinephrine administered at 4:15 pm. A physician at GEO arrived and administered oxygen. He listened to pt&#39;s heart and lungs and reported that there was air movement in her lungs. Pt ceased to respond coherently to questions, slurring and moaning, but did not lose consciousness. Pt started tapping her lips and, upon questioning, said they felt numb. Third dose of epinephrine administered at 4:20 pm. Nurse continued to jostle patient and ask her questions, and patient continued to respond with short, slurred answers. EMS arrived at 4:23 pm and transported patient to the hospital.

While she was waiting she experienced dizziness. Patient stated that she started sweating and felt like it was hard to breath and pain in the stomach. This reaction happened 5 minutes after vaccine was administered. Family members and pharmacy personnel called 911. Patient started feeling better after 10 minutes. Patient&#39;s blood pressure and pulse was within normal range. Patient stated that this has happened twice when she gets blood work if she does not eat before but patient said that she had a meal before being vaccinated. We contacted the patient after the reaction and she stated that she was feeling better.

She was having difficulty breathing and she said &#34;it felt like her throat was closing up&#34;. She did not have a rash at the site of injection and she is not allergic to latex. I gave her water yet that did not help so I administered an Epipen and told her to wait another 20 minutes. She felt an improvement afterwards and I told her to call me if anything else happens. She did not call and she informed her pcp about the reaction.

Since I have received the vaccination, I have had approximately 6 attacks where I had to use my inhaler.  The last one on 04/03/2021 was really bad and I have not tried to run since.  I walked for exercise today and still had shortness (not tightness) in my lungs at a steady walking pace.  I saw the release on the J&amp;J vaccine today and thought I should report this just in case.

Pain, heat induration, redness and itching at injection site.  Itching from injection site moving up arm to neck, side of face and hair.  Itching to inside of mouth and lips.  Feeling of heaviness and weakness to arms and legs.  Chest heaviness and increased work of breathing.  I wasn?t breathing faster, but I was aware of the fact that I had to work harder to breath.  As I said, these symptoms occurred over three days.  The Friday I went to the ED at Hospital.  I arrived around 14:45 and I think it was somewhere around 20:30 when I left.

I turned my head from side to side to make sure my throat was swelling (I&#39;ve had anaphylaxis before).  I got up and went to one of the people in the vests and they took me to the medical tent.  They took my oxygen rate, blood pressure, and checked my heart rate.  I was given (2)  25 mg of Diphen(Benadryl) .  I was monitored till 4 pm when I was released.

On Thursday, 4/8, my arm was less sore and my fatigue and muscle aches were almost gone, however, I woke up with chest congestion and a cough. No fever but the coughs were painful--it almost felt like I had bronchitis. Nothing dire--I can breathe fine, no fever, I don&#39;t feel sick, but I just have this deep cough. When I looked up the side effects, I didn&#39;t see cough or chest congestion so I thought I would report it. Today is Friday, 4/9 and my cough seems to be getting better, although it&#39;s still there and I don&#39;t feel 100% yet.

                                                I had the J&amp;J vaccine on 4/1/21.   I have a history of blood clots. I have tested positive twice. Once back in 2001 when I was pregnant and later on around 2008. I have had these symptoms before, but since I have a rare bone disease and have medical issues I really don&#39;t like to complain and just deal with this stuff with the pain pills I have a prescription for.   Anyway, yesterday I was feeling a little off. My hands, feet and limbs in general tingling. I had a headache which is rare for me and tried to drink extra water, but by 5pmish came I took a handful of tylenol since I had an after work walk to go on with a girlfriend. After the walk I came home and had a desire to lay down and go to sleep. my leg was starting to go from tingle to burn. i decided that i needed to eat some dinner. after dinner i was struggling with breathing while sitting in the recliner chair watching TV, so I told my other half I needed to lay down, this was around 7pm. Then it was just a crazy leg burn from the back of my knee into my foot. I was describing it as if I someone pour gasoline on me and lite the match and I was burning alive. I took a muscle relaxer and forced myself to sleep.   The day after the J&amp;J shot. i had chills and was so cold that mid day when I had breaks during my work from home, i climbed in bed with a heating pad to warm up. the shot also left a scare on my arm, which i found odd since i give myself six injections a week for my bone disease.   I tested positive with Covid December 20th, 2020 and it was a rough first week, but after about 10 days I was pretty much back to walking around and feeling better.    You&#39;re more than welcome to have all of my medical record information, just let me know what you need.   My doctor switched over to a different portal that I don&#39;t have access to and I haven&#39;t talked to her or her office since I had covid back in December and it&#39;s still a few hours before her office opens to report this, but I saw this on the news.   My leg is still tingling and stiff.  Again this is not my first time going through this, so I usually just push through it, but since I saw the news I am reporting it.

                                                Within 2 hours of vaccine I started experiencing shortness of breath and my throat tightened up.  I tried to drive to the ER but stopped at urgent care since they were closest.  They found that along wit my breathing issues my BP was also running higher than normal.  I was given a steroid to get my breathing and BP under control.  I was released to go home, but told that if symptoms returned that I was to go to the ER immediately.  Given a 5-day prescription for Prednisone to keep future symptoms at bay.  The next few days my face and neck were very swelled, but I was able to breathe.  I was given the vaccination in my left arm, and my fingers have been swollen on my left hand.  The fingernails on my middle, ring, and pinky fingers are also very sore to the touch.

Patient presents with concerns related to possible reaction to the J&amp;J COVID vaccine she received last week. She developed some face tingling/numbness, then felt like her throat was closing - not sure if due to lymph nodes swelling or possible reaction. She thought about going to ED or using epipen, but ultimately did not need to do either. She has been on zyrtec for her allergies which have been really bad too, so was not sure if that could be contributing. Later that evening she developed headache, chills, joint/muscle pains and fatigue which continued through the night and into the next day. She also had burning of her skin, specifically her hands and feet. She continues to have some fatigue, joint/muscle pains and mild headache. She is worried about recent development of potential clotting with J&amp;J vaccine - she has factor V Leiden and is supposed to travel later this week. Headache not described as severe, no SOB, leg pain or swelling or abdominal pain reported. Tachycardia  &#34;

                                                I woke-up on 4/7 with an itchy throat and hives were starting to form on my stomach.  As the day went on, the hives were all over my torso and went up to my neck as well.  When I have hives on my neck, they usually start to bother my asthma/breathing, and this happened on 4/7 as well.  My allergist said to up the dosage of Allegra 24 hours from 2 tablets a day to 4.  I also took my Albuterol inhaler to control the wheezing.  My doctor also gave me a prescription for Prednisone in case I needed it over the weekend, and recommended I go to the ER if my symptoms got worse.  Luckily, the extra Allegra and asthma inhaler calmed by symptoms down.   Things calmed down over the weekend and by 4/14, the hives were completely gone and I was not longer experiencing any side effects.  I did not need to do any in-person doctor&#39;s visits; I just talked to my doctor on the phone.  Please note that I also had the &#39;flu-like&#39; symptoms after the shot as well.  I felt great after the shot and even exercised on my elliptical around 7:45 that night.  At around 9:00, I had extreme chills, where my body was shaking, as well as sweating.  I also had extreme fatigue, a headache, and some body aches as well.  I slept for 16 hours that night and felt somewhat better when I got up.  By that late that night, all the flu-like symptoms were gone.   I took some Tylenol for the headache.

                                                I felt nauseated right after my J&amp;J vaccine. I also have dry heaviness. I also experienced flu like symptoms. My chin also swelled up really big and I had hard time breathing. I went to the ER due to my throat swelling up and my difficulty to breathe for three days straight and also felt a pressure sensation in my throat and chest.  At the ER they performed lab work, gave me a Toradol injection and also gave me steroids. I also took a homeopathic remedy which was given to me by a friend who is a doctor and my symptoms started to get better.   On another note, my sister also had the J&amp;J vaccine and she also had nausea symptoms but only lasted 3-4 days but I do not know if this is a genetic component.

The staff noticed I was in some distress and kept asking if I was okay to which I replied I thought I&#39;d be fine once I got some fresh air.  Left the facility to drive home and didn&#39;t feel right, Within 30 minutes, developed chest pains, rash and labored breathing.  I recognize the symptoms as the same symptoms I get when I&#39;ve had morphine, which I now must list as an allergy.  This lasted 4 hours, then got better.  The next day around 1:00, I became ill again with flu-like symptoms and had to leave work.  Headache and body aches mostly.  I was ill with these symptoms for a 24 hour period.  Hopefully all symptoms have passed, except my arm which is red, swollen, itchy and feverish.

                                                About 20 minutes after the injection, I had numbness in my lips and cheeks (it felt like pins and needles).  Over the next 10 minutes, I noticed swelling in my throat (swallowing felt somewhat obstructed).  These persisted for an hour or so until I took Benedryl which seemed to ease the numbness but the swollen throat persisted..

The next day, sysmptoms worsened, with a fever of 101, and increased pain in my arm. It is now April 9, 2021 and my fever is gone but my arm feel numb and I have swelling in my arm pit by lymph nodes and painful to touch. I feel like my vaccine arm is not as responsive and slow. I feel tired, short of breath when I walk which keep me from my usual workout routine.  I work out three times a week and before the vaccine, considered myself to be in very good health. I did have Covid 12/31/20 and my symptoms were far more mild than what I experienced taking this vaccine.

Symptoms worsened as the day progressed.  I triggered a high heart rate alarm on my watch while sitting and dozing about 6:00 pm.   I ended up in bed at 6:30 that night and slept off and on with fever, chills, headache and throbbing arm pain until 7:00 am 4/9/2021.  I had to use my inhaler during the night to help breathe but do not remember the time.  The next day I was much better with the exception of tiredness, nausea and headache throughout most the day.  I have pretty much fully recovered on Saturday 4/10/2021 with only tiredness continuing to bother me as of the this report.  I am sleeping more than usual.        I did not notify the clinic of my reaction as they were closed over the weekend.

                                                Reaction started with cough and increase phlegm in throat and quickly progressed to swollen throat, dry tongue, unquenchable thirst, shakiness, weakness, ears feeling full, headache, increased blood pressure and increased pulse. Called personal physician who recommended going to the Emergency Department. Took one 25-mg benedryl and went to ED where physician confirmed allergic reaction to the vaccine and administered 20 mg prednisone and pepcid. Symptoms improved over two-hour observation and was released. Continued 20 mg prednisone, pepcid (twice daily) and benedryl (every 6 hrs) daily for 4 days, followed by Allegra and Zyrtec once daily each until 4/13/21. Swollen throat, dry tongue, excess thirst, shakiness, weakness, ears full, headache, and increased heart rate/palpitations persist 7 days post-vaccination. Had in-person visit with primary care physician on 4/13/2021 who recommended Nasocort twice daily for two weeks for fluid behind ears and antihistamine once daily for 5 additional days, and will refer to local allergist for work-up.

                                                About 4 days after I started having abdomen pain, it was like having contractions, then bleeding and spotting, and it was a different type of color instead of a period color, more burgundy. it lasted 26 days, when I&#39;d eat it would start again, I started having headaches, and had vision problems, then SOB started and I used the inhaler to help. I also had a low grade fever of 99.8 - 100 that lasted up until about 5 days ago. I started having bruising and leg pain, the bruising would be if someone helped me get up, I have little bruising dots over my body.  I went to the ER 3/16/2021 because the stomach and headache pains, they did a MRI and Ct and said it was acute stomach pain and migraines and told me to see a OBGYN for the bleeding and gave me meds for stomach pains. Bentel for stomach and Floraset for headaches but it never worked. I had a nerve block on my head for the migraines but it didn&#39;t work.  The GYN gave me something to stop the bleeding and she&#39;s wants to do a D&amp;C. I&#39;m waiting to see my PCP on the 19th.  I still have the purple dots and headaches, I still get the contractions and the stomach issues have settled some.

After I come home, I can&#39;t breathe so my husband called 911. I was fainting.  I check everything. I have a problem, I can&#39;t breathe when I read or phone. Now I am better than old. I don&#39;t know what happened. I think it is the problem when I take the vaccine.

                                                Patient stated she took the vaccine on Thursday 3/11/21 and about 3 days later she started to feel a cramp in both of her legs. On 3/27 patient stated she couldnt move and felt like a tingling sensation on the left arm (felt like ants crawling on body), felt dizzy, headache. She stated she then went to the ER on 4/15/21. CT scan (chest) and ultrasound(legs) was done and she wasnt sure of the results (the ER doctor only informed her that she wouldnt be #7). Then on 4/17 patient state she felt fine and was back to exercising and running.  Then on 4/24 she stated she went to the beach to run and felt a sting/cramp on right leg, she looked and noticed a bruise and then as of 4/26 her leg is sore, it&#39;s not red, not hot and not hurting, just sore to touch. Bruising is going away but just uncomfortable to touch.  Patient states she been feeling a little more fatigued and winded out when doing things now more than before  and before taking the vaccine.   Been a 1.5years since her last asthma attack. Since a month ago is when she started to feel that she needs to catch her breath more often. Patient stated she saw her PCP on 4/19/21 and she was prescribed another inhaler (can&#39;t recall the name) and antibiotic.   CT scan was done when she was in the ER because pt had chest pain. No pulmonary embolism indicated on results but she states her scan came back with something on it but she wasnt able to explain what was on there. When she was in the ER the doctor didnt prescribe anything but when she went to see pcp her MD prescribed her an antibiotic (cant recall name, she picked up the rx but hasnt started taking it yet- wasnt home to obtain the name).   As of 4/26 her headache, leg cramps have subsided, she just feels very fatigued. She stated that every time she has a headache she takes tylenol. The last time she took tylenol was on Sunday 4/25/21.  Advised patient to start taking the antibiotic as prescribed by the pcp and to take the inhaler when she feels winded out. Also advised her that if she feels chest pain or extreme sob then to either contact her pcp again or urgent care  She has no follow up scheduled with her PCP.

                                                The next day after the shot, I had a small rash on my wrist.  It disappeared during the day.  Saturday evening, my right thigh felt like it received a trauma like a hit, but I did not have an injury.  An area the size of my hand is slightly pink on the thigh.  On Tuesday, I tried starting ibuprofen, but it did not really remedy the pain.  I went to urgent care Wed. evening.  They sent me for an ultrasound to rule out blood clots.  No blood clots, but lymph nodes were visible in ultrasound.  They suggested I follow-up with PCP.  On Thursday and Friday, the leg felt crampy but less painful.  Friday night the pain traveled down my right leg to ankle as well as right lower lung had dull ache.  Returned to urgent care.  They are treating the leg for cellulitis (1000mg daily of generic Keflex.)  They said if the leg felt better in 24 hrs, probably cellulitis, but if not, it might be a response to vaccine.  There is no relief after 3 doses and 24 hr &#43; later.

                                                I was held for approx 30 minutes. Drove out and when driving home started to get short of breath, so turned towards the hospital rather than home and called them. My significant other also had his shot, so we switched spots driving at that time. I called the hospital on my way when I started to feel my throat start to close at exactly 1829 on my phone (6:29 pm.). Appointment was at 6pm for shot. Hospital was 13 minutes away. Half way there my tongue started to swell and my lips slightly with tingle. My breathing was more labored to keep up effort as I could not expand my lungs to capacity. I was always able to breath and speak, my voice did become more raspy.    Upon ER, Blood Pressure was very Hypertensive around 140s/120s with my respiratory effort to get in. Pulse was stable around 70-80. O2 was 97-99.  I was able to lay down and relax my breathing which relaxed my blood pressure to 140s/ 80s. I was given IV Benadryl, IV Dexadron, PO Pepcid with a liter of fluid. Monitor up until after 8pm when I was released with still mild tonge swelling but breathing ok. Continue Benadryl at home with my Epi pen for bees stings available.    Did go to work today 07/08/2021. Was wheezy, SOB, no throat swelling, tongue swelling at base. Kept up with Benadryl. Made it 1/2 day and went home. Walking and movement makes increase lung workload. My staff concerned with effort and flush skin while getting supplies. But flush and redness does subside some with rest. When talking need to take a break to breath. But can today notice when Benadryl kicks in. No history of Asthma ever or breathing issues ever. Very active on my farm and at work.

                                                Within one minute after the vaccine was administered I felt unable to breathe and was very light headed. I took 25 mg. of Bendryl which helped with the breathing. I felt very faint and experienced episodes of high blood pressure which lead to  uncontrollable shaking. I broke out in hives accross my arms and chest.  I laid with my feet elevated for one hour at which time symptoms subsided and I was able to leave the pharmacy. I had no further allergy type symptoms after leaving the site.

                                                The next day after the vaccine around 12n I began feeling really fatigued and developed a fever off and on through out the day which went as high as 101 causing me to take a tylenol.  I had chills, muscle aches and a cough started.  I had a headache on Sat and Sunday. Sunday I was still fatigued,  slight temp, winded and lightheaded more than dizzy.  The temp finally diminished by the Sunday evening but still winded and very fatigued to date.  I reached out to my PCP for the SOB I was experiencing who advised if it gets any worse to go to the ER for further assistance and the symptoms still persisted so on Tues I went to the Urgent Care but they referred me to a outside makeshaft to setup for COVID testing but nothing still was done.  So  I went back to ER who checked my O2 sats which was good but still nothing was done there either and I am still experiencing the SOB.   I developed a bruise on my left forearm which developed yesterday and today my lower legs has developed various light colored little greyish looking bruises and is very sensitive to the touch.

Patient stated she has some full budding numbing experience but no anaphylaxis. We gave her the J&amp;J covid 19 vaccine and asked her to wait 30 minutes to be monitored due to her past allergies. Around 20 minutes patient let one of the pharmacist know she was feeling very flushed and dizzy. We brought her over to the side to be monitored more closely. We had patient elevate her feet to help with faint feeling and drink some water.  Within 5 to 10 minutes her symptoms  started worsening. Tingling sensation started going up her side of head and neck. It started moving to the front of her face. Once that happened I asked how her breathing was and she was starting to get short of breath. Soon after patients throat started to close. We administer 0.3 m of epinephrine and called 911. Pt was able to breathe a little better but within 5 minutes she was back to gasping for air, we administered another 0.3 mg of epinephrine and the paramedics arrived.

                                                So after I got the shot I had a sore arm for 4 days and when I mean sore I mean pretty sore, if I lifted something it would hurt. It was more sore than the normal for a shot. On Sunday the 14th I woke up with a fever (103F) shortness of breath and a headache, on Mondya the fever was a little lower in the 100s and I still have the shortness of breath. The next day I only had the fever and the whole week I just had a low grade fever (in the 99s) and on Saturday I woke up with high fever again and decided to go get a covid test. My fever broke when I was at the covid test site (Urgent Care) but at night it was back again. My test was negative. I noticed that every time I had high fever, 100s I had shortness of breath - the fever lasted 14 days (low grade for most part). Monday 03/29/2021 at 1:15 I have an appt with my PCP.

                                                Woke up with discomfort/pain in my breastbone area.  It spread to my esophageal tube (extremely tender), a couple hours later my throat became strep-like sore, could not take a full breath, and throat swelling impacted my ability to talk clearly.  About 12 hours later, I had facial swelling.  One full day later, a chain-like rash appeared on my arms, chest, thighs, and feet.  Each subsequent day is spread to a new body part (but never occurred on my face),  I had to take Benadryl EVERY 4-5 hours to keep everything at bay.  Three days into the event my neck and torso skin were extremely painful to touch.  Most days since, I am exhausted and get winded easily.  Today is 30MAR21 and it&#39;s happening again as it began on 21MAR21.  I took two Benadryl in the hopes I will not have to go to ER again.

                                                The patient received a Janssen COVID vaccine on 4/8/21 at around 5:00 pm.  The patient was nervous during the administration and reported never receiving a flu vaccine in the past.  The common side and serious side effects were discussed with the patient.  The vaccine was administered to the patient without issue.  The patient and husband instructed to wait 15 minutes after the administration of the vaccine as is the recommendation per the CDC.  About 5 minutes after the administration of the vaccine, the patient&#39;s husband notified the pharmacy staff that his wife was not felling well.  Pharmacist responded to the patient.  The patient reported shortness of breath and feeling hot and stated she was about to pass out.  Pharmacist was instructed to retrieve the Epi-Pen from the immunization cart and assist.  Code White was called and Division 1 staff responded and assisted.  The patient was lowered to the ground and her feet were elevated.  It was at this point that it was determined that the patient was not experiencing anaphylaxis based on the symptoms she was reporting and exhibiting.  The patient was instructed to remove mask to help obtain better breaths and remove the patient from hyperventilation.  An icepack was obtained and placed on the patients neck once she was able to sit up.  The patient&#39;s symptoms improved to the point of moving to a chair.  The patient sipped water and continued deep breathing.  The patient&#39;s symptoms continued to improve and she was able to leave.

                                                Approximated 12-13 minutes after receiving the shot; my respiration increased, heart rate, and my vision became blurred.  I reported the blurred vision to the Pharmacist and she said they have not heard reports forth this symptom.  Based upon events following the injection relative to my blood pressure; it is likely that my blood pressure became elevated following the injection, resulting in blurred vision.  My blurred vision   resolved several minutes later.  However, my heart rate increased later that evening to the point I slept upright in my recliner that evening.  During sleep, I awoke from my sleep gasping because my heart felt like it was beating too slowly.  It has not been several weeks since receiving the injection, and during this time period, my Blood Pressure (BP) has been fluctuating from &#34;very high&#34; to normal.  Yesterday, I presented to the ER due to High Blood Pressure (145/100), by the recommendation of a NP.   I have NEVER had any history of high BP prior to the injection.

Fever followed and reached 101.2. Intense headache next with nausea, Around 11pm I began wheezing. Just before this I noticed my heart had begun racing. I drank a lot of water during this time, drank soda to settle my stomach and ate 2 crackers. It seemed as though the crackers gave me heartburn. By 6am the following morning fever had come down to a temp (99.2). My headache was just mild and body aches seemed mild. and Some shooting pains remained. On 4/10 around 3pm I felt as though body aches and my headache were worsening. My pulse sped up and my temp began to rise. My temp had risen to 99.8 and my head was becoming much worse so at 5pm I took 3 extra strength Tylenol. This helped a lot.

I felt my throat constricting a bit.  The rash itchiness is still ongoing.

                                                About 3 hours after receiving the , vaccine on April 5 at 3:15 pm, I had uncontrollable shivers and chills, shaking violently through my whole entire body.  I was freezing cold to the bone.   I felt nauseous and threw up my entire dinner.  That didn&#39;t make the nausea go away - I continued to throw up that evening 5 or 6 more times.  The nausea continued the next day making me throw up 3 more times.  And yet the nausea persisted for a whole entire week.  I had a horrible headache that night that has stuck with me these last ten days.  My muscles ached and shot strange pangs through my body.  I was exhausted.  I could not stay awake.  I was so weak and tired.  I had no energy and just laid in bed for a solid four days. My throat hurt, my neck hurt, my head hurt, my arm where the shot went in hurt so bad.  Very strangely, my stomach was constantly bloated and hurt inside like a bad stomach ache - even if I hadn&#39;t eaten anything it still bloated and hurt.  The painful stomach lasted seven or eight days.  I had diarrhea for those seven /eight days.  I was completely dehydrated.  The diarrhea lasted way too long - it was difficult to return to work.  The second day after the shot I woke up to my left eye red, like some blood vessels had burst.  It took four or five days for my eye to go back to normal.   my heart has a stabbing feeling randomly all the time now and it is hard to breathe.  I wheeze and cough all the time.  It is very uncomfortable.  This heart issue has persisted the entire time since getting the vaccine.

Following the headache I experienced bruising on my thighs, tightness in my left arm, bruising oat the injection site for at least one month and a weighted feeling on my chest along with tightness and shortness of breath. Subsequently, I experienced blurred vision and loss of sight one month following injection. The loss of sight lasted close to 10 minutes.

                                                That evening, I began to have difficulty breathing as I did after out of quarantine from COVID. I used my inhaler prescribed to me from having covid in November of 2020. That helped. Then about a week later I started to have leg pain. Not sharp pain, but achey pain in both legs that can not be controlled by Tylenol or Ibuprofen. It has been occurring every few days and some nights like last night are bothersome and I can not sleep well. Also after about a week, I had dryness and redness on the bottom part of my mouth and chin.  In the last week I have had flush on my neck and chest.  It is hot, sometimes causes dryness and pealing and is sometimes itchy.

                                                The adverse reactions of light headedness, throat irritation, heaviness in my chest and difficulty inhaling began about 20 min after my injection, It lasted 5 minutes. About 30 min afterwards the 2nd wave of reaction came on, with the same symptoms but was even harder to inhale and lasted twice as long. I took a combination of benadryl, motrin and pepcid which alleviated the worst of the symptoms after about an hour. To this day, I still cannot take a deep breath in.  About 72 hours after the vaccine I began to have diarrhea (and still have it 20 days later), lethargy, nausea and shortness of breath. The next day I had a little more energy, but still had continued shortness of breath. My vision had become less clear and my thought process a bit fuzzy. This is still happening today. Seven days after the vaccine,  I suddenly became extremely light headed just simply walking. To the extent that I needed to sit or lay down before I began to pass out. After the light headedness came on heavily, I also noticed a very heavy weight on my upper chest and found it quite difficult to inhale. These moments would come and go throughout the day. Regardless of whether I was just sitting and relaxing or walking around. These symptoms would last anywhere from a couple minutes to a couple of hours. I found it very hard to catch my breath and could feel my heart flushing often. Additionally I would wake in the middle of the night feeling that I needed to gasp for air. I sought medical assistance from a clinic, an ER and even my allergist and I am scheduled to see my family physician later this week.   I am not an anxious person, but have experienced many episodes in the last 20 days that have truly made me feel that I was going to die (no exaggeration!) due to the inability to breathe or that I may have been having a heart attack. I began to have chest pain that would travel from the center of my chest to my left shoulder. The pain also would move to my right lung area. During this I also had heaviness in my chest and felt I could not breathe in or out easily. I am still very light headed and have difficulty walking very far without taking a break because I feel I cannot catch my breath. I still have all of the same symptoms that I experienced 20 minutes after my vaccine. These symptoms have varied in intensity. I have often commented to my family that I feel the symptoms of the chest heaviness and heart flushing seem to come in waves. I am a health conscious person and have never had poor health in my life. The events in the last few weeks have definitely taught me how terrible life must be for those who chronically suffer from heart or lung issues. I am still currently battling these symptoms, however, the last few days seem the symptoms have often been less severe.

The fever and flu symptoms went away after 24 hours but the stabbing chest pain lasted for 37 days. The pain was in the center of my chest in different places and it felt like tightening and clenching. The D-Dimer  was elevated and other tests were normal. My Platelets were tested later and were normal. Doctors indicated it was an inflammatory immune response. I went to a Cardiologist for a Stress test which showed ST depression. The chest pain stopped after 37 days. I did have shortness of breath which came and went over the course of four weeks. I am normally in good shape and I run, dance and work out two to four times a week. I have been unable to work out since this began. I also had lightheadedness, chest pain and palpitations seemed to go together. I still have lower back pain and Tinnitus which started two and a half weeks after the shot. It has been five weeks.

When she got home around 5 PM she was still feeling short of breath and reported that her heart was racing. She was unable to speak clearly, but was stating that it was due to be being short of breath.  She also reported feeling lethargic and fell asleep until the next morning. She slept until approximately 12 pm the next day. When she woke up she reported feeling right sided cheek tingling. At that time she thought she had just slept wrong. When she attempted to walk down stairs she was limping and reported just feeling very weak on her left side. On Wednesday she slept in late again complaining of lethargy. When she awoke that Wednesday (3/10) her speech was markedly slurred. She was also saying things that didn&#39;t make sense. She was dragging her left leg when she tried to walk. We immediately took her to the ER and she was worked up for stroke. When she was triaged in the ER we mentioned that she had just had her COVID vaccine and voiced concerned that maybe she had a reaction to her COVID vaccine. She was admitted to hospital on 3/10 for a possible stroke.  Her MRI was done later on 3/11, Her MRI showed that she has strokes on both sides of her brain in the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. The doctor referred to her stroke as being caused by a &#34;showering of clots&#34;. The doctor said this usually only happens to someone with cardiac issues. My mom has no cardiac history. Her doctor ordered an 2D Echo of her heart and no abnormalities were found (3/12).   She is still disabled from her stroke. She was hospitalized from 3/10 - 3/16. She was the discharged to other care facility from 3/16-3/26. She is currently needing outpatient rehab in a day neuro program. She attends this at outpatient facility. She has to walk with a cane due to persistent left leg weakness. Her speech has a slight slur, and she suffers from short term memory loss. She intermittently has trouble with her equilibrium and reports feeling dizzy. She sometimes has a hard time swallowing or says that it doesn&#39;t feel right when  she swallows. She also trouble with word retrieval. She has left-sided neglect which correlates  left eye visual deficits. She currently requires care from a general physician, neurologist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, neuro ophthalmologist and neuo psychologist. She was started on a new medication regime 325 mg aspirin daily, plavix for 21 days (now completed), metformin, amlodipine, coreg and losartan. She is going to need outpatient rehab until at least June from the last update we received from her rehab doctor.

                                                The adverse reactions of light headedness, throat irritation, heaviness in my chest and difficulty inhaling began about 20 min after my injection, It lasted 5 minutes. About 30 min afterwards the 2nd wave of reaction came on, with the same symptoms but was even harder to inhale and lasted twice as long. I took a combination of benadryl, motrin and pepcid which alleviated the worst of the symptoms after about an hour. To this day, I still cannot take a deep breath in.  About 72 hours after the vaccine I began to have diarrhea (and still have it 20 days later), lethargy, nausea and shortness of breath. The next day I had a little more energy, but still had continued shortness of breath. My vision had become less clear and my thought process a bit fuzzy. This is still happening today. Seven days after the vaccine,  I suddenly became extremely light headed just simply walking. To the extent that I needed to sit or lay down before I began to pass out. After the light headedness came on heavily, I also noticed a very heavy weight on my upper chest and found it quite difficult to inhale. These moments would come and go throughout the day. Regardless of whether I was just sitting and relaxing or walking around. These symptoms would last anywhere from a couple minutes to a couple of hours. I found it very hard to catch my breath and could feel my heart flushing often. Additionally I would wake in the middle of the night feeling that I needed to gasp for air. I sought medical assistance from a clinic, an ER and even my allergist and I am scheduled to see my family physician later this week.   I am not an anxious person, but have experienced many episodes in the last 20 days that have truly made me feel that I was going to die (no exaggeration!) due to the inability to breathe or that I may have been having a heart attack. I began to have chest pain that would travel from the center of my chest to my left shoulder. The pain also would move to my right lung area. During this I also had heaviness in my chest and felt I could not breathe in or out easily. I am still very light headed and have difficulty walking very far without taking a break because I feel I cannot catch my breath. I still have all of the same symptoms that I experienced 20 minutes after my vaccine. These symptoms have varied in intensity. I have often commented to my family that I feel the symptoms of the chest heaviness and heart flushing seem to come in waves. I am a health conscious person and have never had poor health in my life. The events in the last few weeks have definitely taught me how terrible life must be for those who chronically suffer from heart or lung issues. I am still currently battling these symptoms, however, the last few days seem the symptoms have often been less severe.

                                                Pt was given Janssen shot at 9:40am. Within 3-4 minutes, pt complained that she felt tingly, lightheaded, faint, and had issues breathing. She was instructed to sit in a chair along with her husband by her side. In the meantime, RPH called for help in the store. Store PIC came over and called 911. After the PIC was on the phone with 911 for 2-3 minutes, the pt complained of trouble breathing and faintness. She was then administered an epi-pen. She started to feel a little better, less faint and could breathe a little easier (maybe 10% improvement) but not great. After 5 minutes, the paramedics had not shown up yet so she was given another dose of epipen because she started to have more faintness, lightheadedness, sweatyness, tingly and SOB. 3-5 minutes after 2nd dose of epi was given, paramedics then arrived to the scene. They took her BP and it was ~ 76/40. They took her away in the aid car.

                                                At 12 hours through 16 hours after administration of the vaccine I experienced rigorous shivers, feeling freezing cold to the bone for hours and couldn&#39;t get warm (even with piles of blankets), periodic heart pain and some chest pressure, periodic knife like stabbing pain in my right knee, mild nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, severe weakness, sometimes a cough.  At 16 hours I got up to get water and had to hold onto things to keep my balance. After drinking a couple of cups of water, I turned away from the bathroom sink and lost consciousness, fainting and falling onto my bathroom floor. The jolt of the fall woke me up and it took a lot of strength to get up. The symptoms were vicious. When I fainted, the brunt of my weight must of been on my upper left rib cage. My ribs were so sore for a week. It was difficult to walk, breath, blow my nose, or cough.  My health provider recommended a Tylenol regime for pain control so that I could take deep breaths and prevent pneumonia. I had a low grade fever of 99 degrees F for one to two days following the vaccine. During the week that followed I felt periodically very ill, had a constant headache for a day or two, and had extremely foggy thinking and sometimes confusion.  I was very fatigued all week long. I lost my appetite and have still not gained my typical appetite back. Day 8 to 9 is when I was finally feeling closer to normal. Today I feel I may be back to 100%, but my rib cage is still healing, either from a contusion, fracture, or break (likely a contusion).

                                                10 days after the vaccine I developed dizziness, tachycardia, dry mouth,chest pressure, shortness of breath and felt like I was going to pass out, and I had a feeling of extreme doom. I was transported to a clinic. There I had a heart rate of 140 with irregular beats. Continued feeling of doom. An EKG showed ST depression. Symptoms improved with nitroglycerin. The clinic didn&#39;t have the technology to provide care so I was emergently transported again. At that hospital my D-dimer was positive and that lead to a CT Angiogram. This showed a pulmonary embolism. Doppler studies of both legs were negative. I was placed on Heparin for several hours and then switched to Eliquis. About 6 hours after being on Eliquis I had the exact same original symptoms and again nitro was given which helped the symptoms. I was placed back on Heparin for a longer period of time. Once I was anticoagulated I was then switch to Eliquis 10mg BID for 7 days then 5mg BID for 6-9 months. I had a CT Angiogram of the head and neck which was normal. At this time I still have dizziness with standing and intermittently with sitting, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath.

This continued for three days before she returned to the pharmacy to report the reaction.

She reports that it is worse at night. She said that the reaction feels similar to her seafood allergy but she only reports tightness and tingling not difficulty breathing.

                                                Within 5 minutes from receiving my J&amp;J vaccine, I went to sit down and I started feeling very hot in my body. My heart started to race, had chest discomfort and had trouble breathing, my trachea closed up, had blurry vision and pain in my chest. I felt like I could not breathe and when the nurse came over to ask me I could not speak to her, I went into a shock and I was placed on the floor and I could not hear anything nor could open my eyes, from my hips down to my feet I could not feel anything, my legs went completely numb and I had a syncope. What I was told from the nurse that I was given an Epi-pen to help with my reaction. When I came back my body was having convulsions, felt my head spinning, had pain in my chest that so very intense and the nurse got me up and took me to a nearby ambulance and the EMT staff placed like a heart monitor because my heart was racing super fast. I also felt heaviness in my chest and inside the ambulance I was given two injections on my left arm and when I slowly started coming back, I was already at the hospital. I was at the hospital from 2pm to 4:30pm more less being monitored.  At the hospital x-ray of the chest was performed as well as lab work and I was discharged home. When I got home, I still did not feel good, I felt heaviness to my chest, still have trouble breathing and get chills during the night. I also could not stand up and have a nerve sensation to my body and the chest pain to my left side is still very present. I have blurry vision, dizziness, headaches, and my heart-beat continues to race very fast.  I get headaches, have abdominal pain and I peed blood few times then that&#39;s when I was able to pee, my abdominal pain was painful like having a baby. On Friday 04-08-2021, I again went to the hospital because I had fallen to the floor on my kitchen floor and my daughter took me to the hospital. I let the nurse staff know that I still have continued chest pain and pressure, difficulty breathing and headaches, dizziness and they monitored and gave me three pills as medication. I was discharged home about 5pm with a referral to see a neurologist due to my chest pain, blurry vision, dizziness and fever which I had these past three weeks. I do not know why I felt all these symptoms after my J&amp;J vaccine.

Pt alert and oriented at this time.  Speaking in full sentence, drinking bottled water without any difficulty. No drooling noted.  Denies SOB, chills or fever.   Emergency Department Attending Attestation Note   See resident/PA/student note for further details of HPI, history, exam, ED course, and diagnoses.   Briefly, this is a 51 y.o. female with PMH reviewed in chart and w/ patient notable for insulin dependent diabetes, depression, prothrombin mutation, migraine, p/w concern for allergic reaction.  Emesis or change in Covid vaccine today.  10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, patient reports feeling thick in her tongue with tingling in her lips.  Patient was given Zertec.  The minutes later, her lips began to swell up and was also noted to have new erythematous rash between her eyes and forehead.  Patient was given 50 mg of Benadryl.  Patient felt like she could not swallow with worsening lip swelling.  She was given EpiPen and 911 was called. No stridors.  No wheezing.  Reports continued tingling and the numbness in her mouth but no lip swelling or tongue swelling.  Denies any difficulty swallowing at this time.  No wheezing.  No abdominal pain or nausea.  No rash at this time.   Of note, patient also notes left-sided facial, arm, and leg numbness starting about 10 minutes prior to arrival to the emergency department.  She reports that she has had recurrent numbness on the left side in the past, which was thought to be due to migraine versus TIA.  She has had extensive work-up and multiple hospitalization for this symptom.  She reports that she is allergic to iodine and gadolinium containing contrast.  Denies any headache at this time though she had a mild headache after receiving the vaccine.  Denies any blurry vision.  Denies any weakness in her bilateral upper and lower extremities.  Assessment and Plan:    Vital signs notable for O2 sat of 96 to 98% on room air without tachypnea.  Patient is mildly hypertensive.  Patient is well-appearing speaking full sentences without any dysarthria.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Extraocular movement intact.  She notes diminished sensation to her left face, left upper extremity, and left lower extremity.  Tongue is midline.  Hearing is intact bilaterally.  No facial droop.  She has 5 out of 5 strength in bilateral upper and lower extremities.  No pronator drift.  Normal gait.  No tongue swelling or lip swelling.  No stridors.  No uvula swelling.  No pharyngeal or erythema.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezing or rhonchi.  Cardiac exam without murmurs rubs or gallops.  Regular rhythm.  No abdominal distention or tenderness on palpation.  No CVA tenderness.   51-year-old female who is presenting to the emergency department with improving lip swelling and numbness in her mouth, raising a concern for anaphylaxis related to her Covid vaccine.  Reassuringly, status post EpiPen, her symptoms are improving.  However, she has new onset left-sided numbness, with without any headache.  She reports that she has had this numbness in the past the last time she had the numbness on the left side was approximately 10 years ago.  Her neurologic exam is only notable for diffuse numbness on her left side including her face.  Differential diagnosis include migraine headache and TIA.  Stroke is possible though less likely given the patient has had the same symptoms in the past with negative work-up.  Will defer code stroke at this time but will emergently consult neurology.  Will get labs including BMP and CBC.  We will continue to monitor her from the anaphylaxis perspective.  We will also give her a dose of steroid.  Prednisone 60 mg by mouth given 12:29 PM  NEUROLOGY CONSULT NOTE  Assessment: Formulation- Diagnosis is guarded. Localization structurally would suggest subcortical (thalamic) or small brain-stem in a sensory territory on the right. Etiologies could be stroke given her vascular risk factors but seems unlikely given there is stereotypy of earlier symptomatology. Demyelinating would be another possibility as well, but again, the stereotype. Seizure unlikely because of the timing of rush from toes to body was minutes and duration of some occasions being days. Complicated migraine possible, has some risk factors, but should be treated as dx of exclusion. She does make complaint of headache, which could support. Some FND elaboration on her anxiety-ridden allergic reaction is also possible, but no objective non-structural signs to support.

                                                She developed a large pulmonary embolus, and she died on 3/17 at Hospital. She developed symptoms of SOB on 3/11, and was admitted to the hospital. She was initially stable and not requiring oxygen and was sent home on anticoagulation. However she returned the same day with worsening symptoms, troponin now elevated, and ECHO showing signs of right heart strain. Embolus on imaging had increased in just over days from previous CT scan. She became pulseless and died despite resuscitative efforts. It is my opinion (Dr.) that she died of a pulmonary embolus, and an autopsy is pending.

It can be painful. It&#39;s like I struggling for air. It does not last long, but it seems to be happening a little more often. I have also experienced a little more film that I have to spit out. The shot triggered my hot flashes again as well.

I got this sensation about 4 times that day. Twice at vaccine facility and 2 more times at home that same day. Then in the past couple of weeks I?ve had numbness in the right side of my face, arm/hand and leg/foot. Sharp pains in my head, PVC, eye pressure, vision issues, shortness of breath, electric shock sensations through my body, head tingling. Not sure the cause of these symptoms but the only different/new thing was the vaccine.

She experienced severe chest pain, pain that radiates through her arm to her hands, numb tingly hands, dizziness, nausea, and SOB.  This event lasted about 5 to 10 minutes. The remainder of the week she continued to experience mild discomfort, SOB, dizziness, heart palpitations, and lethargy.  At 2 to 3 days after injection, she did notice some swelling at the injection site.  She did not seek medical attention, but did message her physician.  She was told it was likely from the vaccine and to take some acetaminophen. No physical evaluation was performed on the patient.

Onset of right eye not blinking/closing. * MAR 21st = Emergency Room.  Diagnosed w/ BELLS PALSY.  [Ruled out stroke]  The following week after my vaccination (approximately MAR 15th), I experienced a strange feeling at the back of my throat.  It can best described as a &#34;sore throat&#34;.  I noticed it upon waking up.   I could feel it at the back of my throat when swallowing;  the act of swallowing would enable me to &#34;feel&#34; the sensation at the back of my throat.  This was unusual and not normal for me.  I thought I was coming down with a cold virus.  I had not been sick for over a year and thought it was a strange feeling.  I was concerned.  With the recent schools, restaurants, and gyms opening up with less restrictions, I learned from coworkers that there was an increase of illnesses  because our immune systems are not as strong and germs are easily transferable during the usual interactions.  Therefore, I expected my sore throat to be the start of a harmless cold virus.   Then, later in the week (MAR 19th), I noticed my eyes were abnormally dripping tears.  It is my experience that I get this effect in the office setting or during winter when my eyes are &#34;dry&#34;.  However, I was neither in the workplace (office), nor was it winter.  I was not sure why my eyes had excessive tears coming out.  Finally, on SUN (MAR 21st), an obvious physical symptom finally became apparent to me and my family members.  My speech was impaired.  I could not chew properly.  I could not drink from a cup.  I struggled during breakfast.  I was not sure if I was having a STROKE.  I recited the alphabet to hear for a slurred speech.  I looked in the mirror, and my smile was not perfect.   I got dressed and went to the Emergency Room.   The doctors performed physical PUSH-PULL tests, eye tests, etc.   DIAGNOSIS = Bells Palsy.     OTHER SYMPTOMS = &#43; shortness of breath.  &#43; leg swelling.  &#43; headaches.  &#43; excruciating pain in the neck, especially during sleep (laying down).

Within first 3-4 hours had bad rash on arms, legs, face, neck and chest, fast heartrate, breathing and out of it sensation. I felt like I was having a partial analpylaxis reaction - like throat 1/2 closed but that I would be ok. I took Benadryl and used a Ventolin inhaler. Rash was better by 2nd day.  On 2nd and 3rd day I was having massive headache (felt like pressure from inside all over out to all cranial sutures), severe neck stiffness on rt side, lumbar vertebrate pain, iliosacral and hip pain, felt painful radiating spasms down my left and right legs, also jaw and teeth pain. Taking Naproxen and now ASA.  Very shakey and jittery. Occasionally have lower arm pain and numbness on left side. Also have injection site symptoms but minor compared to above. It&#39;s been 1 week and allergic part of rxn is over but concerned with possible neuro and bloodclot possibilties..  On day 2 or 3 I also had problems with my brain with reading comprahension.

                                                Felt slightly dizzy or &#34;woozy.&#34; It came and went for about 45 minutes as I sat in my car in the parking lot after vaccination. After about an hour, it completely subsided and I didn&#39;t feel dizziness anymore. I did not receive any treatment for this.  Also, on the fourth day after vaccination (April 13), I felt pressure/tightness in my chest. Because the blood clot cases had been publicized, I called my doctor, who advised me to go to the emergency room of our local hospital. They gave me an EKG, which looked fine, and said they thought the tightness might be related to my asthma (although that is not a symptom I have ever felt with my asthma before, which usually manifests as slight wheezing). The chest tightness lasted about two days and then went away completely without treatment.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. I had a tightness/closing of my throat about 25 minutes after the injection.  Not all the way but a bit. That eased after about 1/2 hour and I was left with a scratchy, sore throat for rest of the day. The next day it was fine.  The other main side effect was being very tired the night of the injection and later the next day.

I have never experienced anything like it before. It only lasted a few hours, but it was a very strange feeling. I also had waves of fatigue and felt achey  on and off for two weeks afterward.

Started with some chills and then at 2:00 a.m. (4/2/21) I had a fever of 103.9, chills, shakes and heavy breathing.   I felt froze to the bone.  Took 2 Tylenol for the fever and it went down to 102.4 for approximately 12 hours.  My feet were very sore for the first 48 hours and hurt to walk on them.    For the next two days, had a fever of 101-102 along with periods of heavy sweating that got worse during the nights.  This lasted for three days/nights.   Since I had the shot one week ago, I have been experiencing the same sore feet and have different aches and pains that appear in my body.   They kind of feel like a muscle ache after a Charlie horse and it happens in my calves, back of the legs and back area throughout the day.   I am experiencing fatigue during the day .  I did not have any nausea  with the vaccine.

I received shot, and within a minute or two- my lips and tongue started to tingle, swell and go numb.  My throat started to swell too.  Had a hard time starting to breathe and took my xopenex inhaler.  I had taken a benadryl beforehand, and ended up taking two more as EMT came over to  help me there at the site.  She kept an eye on me.  My A Fib was speeding up and getting irregular too.  After about half an hour, it stopped getting worse and seemed to level off.  They offered to take me to ER, and had me promise to call 911 if it got bad again.  Still felt bad the rest of the day.  Felt a little better later the next day, and a little better (today is day 3), but still not 100%.  I did contact my doctor to check in

The next day, I developed chest pain, racing heart, shortness of breath, and insomnia. I continue to have chest pain. On 04/08/2021, without injury or anything that I did, my right middle finger swelled and turned purple and it&#39;s still purple. The ER doctor said it was a hematoma.

Within an hour the right side of my face and ear started to hurt, almost like it felt burnt, The nerve endings was super sensitive and has still not gone away. That night I didn&#39;t feel good, tired and out of it. On the third day I woke up with a rash on various parts of my body and moved to my eye lids as well. I called for a telehealth, and asked for a low dose steroid and he said not because I would &#34;disrupt my immune response&#34;.  I&#39;m still having issues.

                                                Had shot on Monday.  Horrible pain in arm at injection site that went up my neck to my head.  Sinuses flared up and ears started beeping.  Became dizzy and nauseous and had difficultly breathing.  Went to pass out due to blood pressure drop.  Had to breath in alcohol wipes and then both arms went into pain as if falling asleep only 100 times worse.  Could not moves my arms - hands were cramping.  Took 1 hour to get back to some normal to drive home. The next day/Tues my sinuses where still a little swollen along with a little bit of arm pain, nausea and fatigue.   Wed - Fri sinuses continued to be swollen then on Fri - Sun had coughing.  Following Mon was weaker and feeling low immune.  Tues ended up at doctor&#39;s office having gone into a sinus infection.  Was also experiencing shallow breathing in neck and chest.  Started Augmentin 875mg 2 x a day Tues - Fri.  Then Fri night went into a severe inflammation in my chest, throat and esophagus with difficulty to catch my breath and couldn&#39;t eat.  Sat reached out to document through EMR and was prescribed a Steroid (6 days) which I started on Sun morning.  Was very weak and took that whole week with full does of steroid to get back to normal breathing.  Finished Antibiotics (12 days worth) 2 days after completing the steroid which was now Sunday.  Then still had some sinus recovery where ear was beeping in and out for 2 more days.  By Wed of the 4th week things were returning to normal.  Total time to recover was exactly 4 weeks.

                                                This is my second report (same vaccine Johnson and Johnson on March 23 lot #1805031) because my symptoms are still present; my first report was on 04/07/2021. I currently have depression, tinnitus, fatigue, brain fog, sometimes I feel shaky on the inside, swaying at times, and dizziness/vertigo. I sent follow-up information for my first VAERS report via mail and a pdf document to VAERS webpage; I attempted to fax several times but it came back unsuccessful; I left a message for a representative to return my call and nobody called back. I want to make sure you get this information, hence this second report.  Additional Follow-up Information: Hospital Emergency Room visit on April 8, 2021: purple finger, racing heart, chest pain. EKG, body scan for blood clots, and blood panel.  Doctor video visit on April 16, 2021: chest pain, feeling horrible, shortness of breath, metallic taste in the mouth, tinnitus, insomnia, anxiety, and depression.  Doctor office visit on April 29, 2021: headache, dizziness, fatigue, brain fog, stress, depression, thirsty, pressure at temples and back of head and forehead, rocking, anxiety.

Then yesterday  morning was a little achy and by afternoon was miserable the next day she got really tired, joints hurting and had to take a nap.  She cancelled one of her appointments  she&#39;s a home health nurse and went to sleep and when she woke up her throat was swollen, hurting, labored swallowing and when she would drink her ears would pop, and her tongue was swollen but could breathe fine, and then it progressed to where she could not swallow at all.  She took two Benadryl&#39;s and went to rest, and she was not able to move and had to have help getting dressed.   Her joints are swollen, her hands are swollen, but her throat is not hurting like she was yesterday.

Throat swelling went down about 10: 00 PM; facial tingling/numbness also got better and is just very slight the next morning.

No treatments yet....but if still bad after this weekend, will seek medical help.  Left eye swelling started at 2pm today, with pain. the eye lid and the area around the left eye are painful and swollen. I have been using hot compresses.  Difficulty catching my breath today durning a morning walk. I have been walking for months on the same path and can hold a conversation, but today, I could barely walk and talk. Once I stopped talking I eventually was able to catch my breath, but we had to walk a much slower pace as well.

Also experienced shortness of breath, worsening of asthma symptoms and lightheadedness. Woke up on the 5th morning with delayed reaction at injection site. No visible rash or bruise at this time, but hard lump at site and entire upper arm feels very bruised and sore to the point that it hurts to lift the arm. Ibuprofen is all I have taken for it. Will see a doctor if not improved in the next two days.

                                                I had leg pain beginning 3/16.  I also experienced a headache, body aches, fatigue and loss of appetite.  On, 3/17,  I experienced confusion.    On 3/31,  I began to experience body chills and congestion which lasted several days. On 4/3,  my symptoms increased with lower back pain and abdominal pain on my right side.  I went to a clinick on 4/3 and received a positive covid test.  My symptoms increased over the following weeks to include: temperature, body aches, sweating, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, coughing, dizziness and persistent diarrhea.  I went to the ER for care on 4/8 and have been receiving continued care from my physician regarding possible pneumonia, shortness of breath, and chest tightness.

A few minutes later I felt difficulty breathing and realized that my throat was swelling.  My heart began to race, but I cannot say if that was a result of the other symptoms I was experiencing.   The dizziness and weakness lasted for about 2 hours. The difficulty breathing and swollen throat eased after about 7 hours.  Just as I thought that I was feeling better, a fever set in around 11pm along with the chills, joint aches and pains, and general malaise. These flu-like symptoms lasted for roughly 36 hours.

Headache dissipated after approximately 12 hours after onset. Nausea/vomiting occurred approximately 12 - 20 hours after vaccination. Fever completely gone 26 hours after vaccine. 48 hours later back to normal. If the booster is reported to have similar side effects I will skip it.

Concomitant medications included Acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) to prevent blood clot, and Prednisone for an unknown indication.  On 09-APR-2021, the patient experienced stinging in the right arm for a few seconds while getting the vaccine shot, then pain in left arm, stomachache in the night, profound weakness in the legs, heaviness in both legs and both arms, shortness of breath, out of body feeling, severe pain in the epigastric area. It was reported that vaccine could have triggered a rheumatoid arthritis reaction in legs hands, feet and arms. The feeling of weakness and heaviness in the arms and legs were still on going, and the reaction with Aspirin occurred about 30 minutes ago but became better once she took a liquid antacid. The patient took the Aspirin to prevent clots because she was on prednisone, which was read on the news that blood clots may form after getting the vaccine. She attributed the heaviness of the arms and legs as a possible rheumatoid arthritis flare. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable.

Concomitant medications included Centrum Multi-Gummies for Women.  On an unspecified date in MAR-2021 the patient began to experience slowly progressive shortness of breath; on 01-APR-2021 she had left upper quadrant pain. On 03-APR-2021 the patient presented to the emergency room.  Laboratory data included: Pulmonary Angiogram/CT Chest - abnormal and computerised tomogram abdomen/pelvis at 09:37, showed segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the lower lobes of both lungs. Small volume perisplenic hemorrhage and small volume pneumoperitoneum in the pelvis or findings concerning for spontaneous splenic rupture and moderately enlarged spleen. Additional CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast at 23:05 showed: Small to moderate amount of hemoperitoneum, slightly increased since the earlier study. There is definitely new blood adjacent to the liver. The hemorrhage adjacent to the spleen appears similar to the earlier study. Due to the timing of the scans with relation to the contrast injection, the physician could not confirm a splenic laceration, although it was suspected to be the source of hemorrhage. Small amount of mesenteric blood was slightly increased. Continuous heparin infusion was started for bilateral pulmonary embolism. On 04-APR-2021, an inferior vena cava filter was placed and patient was vaccinated with Acthib (HIB Vaccine), Bexsero (meningococcal vaccine) and Prevnar (pneumococcal vaccine) in anticipation of splenectomy. On 07-APR-2021, a laparoscopic splenectomy was performed. The spleen was evaluated by pathology which reported that organizing blood clot on surface was consistent with rupture. No evidence of malignancy was reported.  The patient was also treated with anticoagulant therapy (dates unspecified). The patient remained inpatient while recovering from surgery.  On 12-APR-2021, the patient was transitioned to rivaroxaban for therapeutic anticoagulation. Patient remained hospitalized as of 12-APR-2021.  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from pulmonary embolism, haemoperitoneum, mesenteric haemorrhage, splenic haemorrhage, splenic rupture, splenic thrombosis, splenomegaly, dyspnoea, abdominal pain upper, and left upper quadrant/abdominal pain. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, Disability Or Permanent Damage).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 53-year-old female patient of unspecified ethnicity was found to  have pulmonary embolism and spontaneous splenic rupture 18 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  No concurrent illness and medical history reported. Emergency room consult for slowly progressive shortness of breath and left upper quadrant pain that starts on an unspecified date after vaccination.   Pulmonary Angiogram/CT Chest showed segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the lower lobes of both lungs; small volume perisplenic hemorrhage and small volume pneumoperitoneum in the pelvis; moderately enlarged spleen with findings concerning for spontaneous splenic rupture.  CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast showed small to moderate amount of hemoperitoneum, slightly increased since the earlier study; definite new blood adjacent to the liver.  Continuous heparin infusion was started; vaccinated with Acthib (HIB Vaccine), Bexsero (meningococcal vaccine) and Prevnar (pneumococcal vaccine).  Laparoscopic splenectomy was done 22 days after vaccination; pathology report is consistent with splenic rupture with no evidence of malignancy.  The patient was shifted to rivaroxaban.  No other details reported. The information available regarding splenic rupture precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  Based on the information that is available, the event pulmonary embolism is assessed as plausible with the causal association to immunization, per WHO causality classification of adverse events following immunization based on a lack of a definitive plausible biological mechanism; considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, the potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

She said she thought the needle was still in the arm until she felt the bandaid go on and realized it wasn&#39;t. She said she felt nauseous, and slouched down in her seat. I went to get a trash can just in case she got sick and she immediately got out of the chair and said she needed to lie down on the floor. We placed her on the pharmacy floor and she said she was having a hard time breathing and her head &#34;felt funny and weird&#34;. I retrieved the EpiPen but she said she never had one and didn&#39;t want to get it yet. She was conscious the whole time and appeared to be hyperventilating so we never administered the Epipen. She said her fingers were tingly and requested we call the paramedics so we did. They arrived very timely and took over. They took her BP and it was fine. They asked if she wanted to go to the hospital and she said no. She stated she was starting to feel better, she could breath more easily. She  eventually was able to sit up and the paramedics got her to call her son to come pick her up and the paramedics walked her out of the store to meet him.

She stated her bones hurt, sore arm, hard bump at injection site. She also reported shortness of breath.

She also experienced shortness of breath.  She stated she took benadryl every 2 hours for the rash which controlled it and monitored herself with the shortness of breath.  She also stated that since she was asthmatic if the shortness of breath would have gotten worse she would have gone to the ER (luckily this wasn&#39;t necessary).

I woke in the middle of the night in a crying fit because I thought I was going to die I felt soooo bad ! It was worse than any flu Id ever had! My joints hurt, my head wanted to explode , fever of 101.3 , breathing issues , exhaustion, thirsty...this lasted 2 to 3 days. Ive had a couple of days here in beginning of april til now of waking up feeling sick again. It doesnt last all day. Sometimes it just before bedtime. I guess I just feel a bit sick, but that could also be the cancer that ive had since july 2020 that hasnt been treated by a health care system I have?

                                                Shortly after the shot I felt a little odd.  I felt like I had a fast heartbeat or extremely high anxiety.  Felt like I had 20 cups of coffee.  I was really hyper the night of the shot.  Only got (4) hours of sleep.  The symptoms continued for approx 24 hours.  I had shortness of breath at times which could be from my heartbeat flucuating or I had anxiety.  I am also very irritable.  No other reactions.  Other than that I feel back to normal after about 48&#43; hours.  Praying I don&#39;t have any heart damage or lunch damage from what was injected into my body.

I visited Dr. and he has ordered tests to check on my heart. I told him I was concerned about the &#34;pause&#34; and the reason for pause because I feel pretty miserable, and he added a CT test that will be done in two to three weeks. I do not know if he will report my symptoms as possibly vaccine related.

Lasted for 2 weeks, strong. Week 3 and 4 slightly better with some days feeling an ease of reactions.  However, find that even today at about 5 weeks out, the symptoms still are sometime there.  Feel like I never fully recovered.  Some days are good and some days are not.

                                                6 days after shot I got a debilitating headache (the worst headache of my life 10/10 pain).  I went to the ER and they proceeded to do a CT scan and blood work.  Nothing abnormal was found.   The next day I went to Hospital ER due to the head pain, shortness of breath, chest pain and high blood pressure.  They put me on steriods and pain meds and I was referred to a Cardiologist and neurologist.  4 days later I was in the ER again for head pain, my BP was 220/125 due to pain when entering the hospital.  After about 2 weeks, I saw  a neurologist.  He prescribed various pain meds including anti- seizure meds and shots.  The cardiologist feels that it is not a heart issue.   I remain having  daily headaches 6 weeks later but the intensity is lower (5/10).  My BP is now back at a normal level.  I am awaiting 2 more tests.  MRV and spinal puncture test.

Took an alleve which helped but the headache did not go away. 4/7-4/12  bad headache exacerbated by  going outdoors in sunlight. persistent grogginess every  morning. very difficult to wake up. I  run several days a week was able to  complete 4 miles no problem .  but headaches would be worse being outside in daylight. 4/13 I read news of headaches and  clotting rx  so I saw my Dr.  did blood work and scheduled for MRI.  blood work /platelets came back WNL . MRI was cost prohibitive for me so I cancelled MRI would follow up with MRI if headaches worsened and or developed other symptoms. 4/13-4/21 Persistent , annoying headache but improving somewhat. Still have difficulty waking up in the am. 4/22 First day that headache mostly was not present. Difficulty waking up in the am still.  4/17

                                                Received Vaccine on the 4/8 that night I was very cold had 5 blankets, teeth shattering, severe headache, &amp; knees like if they were breaking them. The following day slight headache, weakness, not feeling good.  On the evening of 4/15, it hurt to breathe and I had a burning sensation on my rib cage going to my back. I thought I could handle it until Monday to see my Dr.  but by the time I went to the ER it hurt to walk, talk, breathe and the burning sensation would not go away.  I went to the ER on 4/17 he said I had a collapsed lung, gave me something for pain via IV.  Did an EKG, Chest X-Ray, CT Scan, and Lab work. He let me go and said to take deep breaths every hour on the hour and to drink lots of water.  I got in to see my regular Dr. on 4/22 and he said I had an allergic reaction to the vaccine.  He gave me Gabapentin 100 mg 3 times a day and Tramadol q 6 hours for pain.  I called him back because I still have the pain and now I am taking 300 mg Gabapentin in the am and 300 in the pm.  It is still not working.  I am constantly hurting the burning sensation on my rib cage and goes back to my back, it hurts to breathe, walk, talk, drive, I have blurred vision , dizziness and weakness.  I have an appointment with Dr.   again tomorrow.

I took Benadryl and itch is subsiding. I hope this is the end of side effects!

Eyes with itching and mild wheezing began 2 hours after injection. Symptoms came and went for next 6 hours. Day after injection had light rash and itching over arms and legs that lasted for 24 hours.  On second day after injection only itching of skin.  Did not take any medications to stop symptoms. I am a physician and felt comfortable self monitoring.

                                                Immediately after patient received her vaccination she said her breathing is changed, she used her Proair. As she was sitting in just 5 minutes and being monitored, she reported tingling inside the roof of her mouth, she was immediately given 50mg of diphenhydramine and famotidine. In about 5 minutes, patient said she felt better and everything has returned to normal. I started to initiate a call to 911 but the patient stopped me and said she would not go that she is all better. Patient was monitored for an hour and her husband who also received the vaccination took her home. The pharmacy followed up on her and she is doing well.

                                                FOR 3 WEEKS FOLLOWING THE VACCINATION:   I had aches in all of my joints (elbows, wrists, and knees).  I thought maybe i am developing arthritis.  This lasted for approx 3 weeks and then suddenly stopped. Was it joint inflammation?   I had no other symptoms.   I did not visit the doctor. Within 5 hours of the vaccination, symptoms started with pain in both of forearms.  Overnight I developed fever, lethargy , aches and pains.  Took Tylenol.  Slept for approx 36 hrs.  I felt much better after 40 hrs.   I was not concerned.  I would say my symptoms were moderate or worse. In March of 2020, I had shortness of breath in my left lung .  It lasted for days.  I was concerned but I did not visit the doctor.  It eventually went away.  Could I have had Covid then?  A sure possibility but I will never know!

As more days passed; I was feeling tired, could not raise my arms, legs were weak and hurting.  If I did anything (shower or carry a simple laundry basket) my arms would hurt so bad, I was out of breath and my heart was pounding so hard.  By the week of March 29th - I was laying down in the middle of the day, no energy at all.  Called the doctor and because of the shortness of breath &amp; Body aches, they would only schedule a video visit for Monday, April 5th.  After talking to me, they schedule to see me that day at 11:45 AM.  I had weak muscle response in my arms, pale, and out of breath.  They did blood work.  Two hours after getting home; they called and said I needed to get to the emergency room.  My red blood cell count was dangerously low, and they ordered a blood transfusion.  I sent 6 days in the hospital.

Progressed to coughing and feeling a lump in my throat and then tightness in my chest. My blood pressure elevated to 152/100. At that point I self administered epi pen and paramedics called 911. This provided relief but after about 5 to 10 minutes the tightness in my chest and the feeling I couldn?t get a deep breath began to return and the paramedics administered two puffs of an albuteral inhaler and transported me to the hospital. At the ER, they did an EKG, started an IV and administered fluids, prednisone and Benadryl. I was discharged about 90 -120 minutes later with a prescription for 3 days of prednisone (50mg) and instructions to continue to take 25 mg oral Benadryl every 4 hours.  The next morning my face and chest were red and looked like I was sunburned. My face was also swollen.

After the first 24 hours, my breathing became more shallow, and I had an increased hunger to add to the body aches.  I felt as if I had the flu.

                                                Received injection on Sunday. Monday was nauseated and had chest pressure.  Nausea and CP came in waves and occurred about 10 times. Then stopped.   Felt &#34;off&#34; for 4 days.  Felt fine on Friday and through Wed 3/23/21 until 9:10 PM.  Developed visual changes in left peripheral bilat.  Appeared like waves in an arc.  Then began to not be able to breathe.  I had to tell myself to breathe.  Called squad, arrived 9:45pm.  BP 170/110, HR 118. By 10pm, the visual changes disappeared BUT developed chest pressure in same area as the MOnday after the vaccine.  Then became extremely nauseated, almost vomiting.  Nause came in waves for next 6 hours until it calmed down.  Then returned Wed am for several hours, again in waves along with hollow chest feeling and pain. Continued with headache off and on with brain fog the remainder of Wednseday 3/23/21.  Discussed with hospitalist at Hospital and was told to report it to the CDC as likely an adverse effect to the vaccine.  Was still in the 14 day window.     Thank you,  RN, PhD, MSN, MS, BSN

                                                Difficulty taking deep breaths, dizziness that felt more like vertigo (the floor and ceiling spinning whenever I stood or sat up), exhausted to the point that I could not sit up without falling asleep.  I slept 14hrs straight for two days after the shot.  Tired after walking down the driveway and back.  Entire body aching with excruciating pain but not the left arm where the shot was taken.  Headaches were bad as well.  No appetite.  The 3rd day afterwards I felt better but still very tired.  The 4th day still tired but better.  Tylenol, caffeinated coffee and lots of water seem to help me get through this.  The fifth day afterward, I am almost 100%  but dealing with running nose and eyes which may not be related to the shot.

                                                ABOUT 15 HOURS AFTER INJECTION I HAD A EXTREME HEADACHE AROUND THE EYE AND NOSE AREA. I LAYED DOWN WITH A COLD PACK OVER MY EYES FOR ABOUT 2 HOURS.  I FINALLY DECIDED TO TAKE A COUPLE TYLENOL AND DISCOVERED IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO SWALLOW.  I TOOK A BENADRYL PILL AS WELL AND LAYED BACK DOWN.  MY THROAT BECAME LESS RESTRICTED SO  I JUST CONTINUED TO MONITOR MYSELF.  THE HEADACHE BECAME LESS SEVERE BUT CONTINUED FOR ANOTHER 24 HOURS OR MORE.  I CONTINUE TO BE TIRED BUT ALSO WORK LONG HOURS.  TODAY, 04/23/21, TWO WEEKS AFTER INJECTION, I WENT TO URGENT CARE TO HAVE A ANTIBODY TEST DONE.  BOTH THE IGG AND IMG CAME BACK NEGATIVE!

                                                I tracked my symptoms in a notebook because they were so severe on Day 1. Day 1-3: sore arm, headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, foggy brain, unable to focus, chills/uncontrollable shaking for several hours, body aches. Day 4: Same symptoms as above but milder. Bleeding gums when brushing teeth on left side of mouth (this NEVER happens). Painful gums (does happen when very sick with a virus). Day 5-6: Feeling better, but tired. Day 7: Tired, headache, nausea following exercise. Day 8-12: Mild feeling of discomfort while peeing. Tired every day.  A bitt foggy every day but this happens with pollen season. Day 18: tired, trouble breathing on treadmill- I attributed this to pollen as it went away the next day when I closed the window. Day 20 (May 1): While out with friends, after having lunch and a glass of wine, I jumbled a few words and could not say them correctly. There were just about two words in two sentences. I tried a few times and they kept coming out wrong. It was nothing I have ever experienced before. We laughed it off but I felt very unsettled and a bit concerned about driving home. I drove home and was fine. I remain tired and feeling foggy which could be  due to pollen. I have scheduled an appointment with a clinician today and hope to have some blood work done.

                                                My issues initially started about an hour after the vaccine.  I became very subdued, no appetite and &#34;foggy&#34; for a lack of better words.  I attributed this to what others stated were &#34;typical reactions&#34; and did not make a fuss over it.   The following day I was VERY tired and stayed in bed and then about half way thru day 3, I became alert and resumed normal activity.  At day 13 I began to have upper thigh pain in my left leg and began to feel winded as I was would walk up steps and do housework which had not happened previously ever..  On 4/14/21 I requested an appointment with my primary care doctor, however he was booked for 2 weeks and I was referred to an associated PA  where I received a virtual consult.  He told me that I was &#34;over the age&#34; of the women that were having reactions ,even though I had requested a Doppler.  He only ran bloodwork, and in fact never even called me back on the bloodwork, and just posted it in the online profile.  My ankles are VERY swollen and have bluish pitting and my feet do have considerable pain.  I do have right side abdominal pain everyday since the 13th of April.

                                                I felt fine immediately after the injection - just a little pain in the arm where I got the injection and when raising my arm. By 6:30 pm I was achy all over and my legs were aching a lot. When I went to bed around 8:00, I hurt all over (achy and flu-like feeling, but no fever). I dozed off and on and about midnight when I woke up, I had a very rapid heartbeat. This went on all night and into the morning. It was hard to get any sleep at all. When I&#39;d get up to go to the bathroom, I was slightly dizzy and unsteady on my feet. After I got up at 6:30 am, the highest my heartrate got was 113, then it finally began going down. I was still hurting all over, felt extremely tired, and now had fever - 99.8. The fever lasted off and on all day and into the next night. I was also very nauseated all day and I felt extremely bloated. I also had a bad headache. When I woke up on Friday, my fever and the headache was gone, but I felt extremely tired and weak and still nauseated. I slept most of the day and I still ached all over, but not as much. My lymph nodes were also swollen. On Friday afternoon, I walked up to the mailbox and I was winded and unsteady. On Saturday, I felt a little better, but was still extremely tired. By Saturday night, all the aches, pains and headache were back and I didn&#39;t sleep well at all. I rested most of Sunday and felt a little better Sunday evening. The aches and pains were going away, but I was still very tired and exhausted. I felt the same way when I woke up on Monday morning. It seemed like the vaccination made the aches and pains I normally had with Fibromyalgia about three times as bad as usual. And I was still very bloated feeling all over. By Monday afternoon the nausea finally went away. By Monday afternoon I was feeling a little better, but still tired. On Tuesday I felt better still and I noticed that I wasn&#39;t bloated as much. It seemed like I was getting back to normal.

It feels like discomfort in my upper left chest which radiates to the front chest at times.  Some shortness of breath but not severe, noticeable but not terribly uncomfortable. This continues to the present.

I couldn&#39;t take a deep breath and I couldn&#39;t exert myself at all without it hurting in my chest.  The 2nd symptom, I went to doctor (21 days after) and he checked my platelets. I woke up three times during the night with pain in my left calf. A couple of nights previously I woke up with those same pains in my left calf, as well. It was worse pain the second time. I went to the dr and he did bloodwork. I did not have any other pains after that.

CT-PE showing submassive saddle pulmonary embolism with several large emboli in bilateral upper and lower pulmonary arteries.  Transferred from outside hospital to another Hospital.  Started on IV Heparin  infusion with transition to Enoxaparin.  Had significant drop in platelet count and developed peripheral thrombi in all extremities.  Concerned for HIT at that time, and review of CDC recommendations for COVID vaccine-associated thrombi, patient transitioned to Fondaparinux and remains on at present.

My blood pressure continued to spike out of control, and I had chest pains, shortness of breath and nausea.  I went back to my doctor on the 15th and had another abnormal EKG.  She sent referred me to a cardiologist, who I saw on the 16th.  She prescribed new blood pressure medication.  I made an appointment for additional testing, but ended up hospitalized on the 23rd when my symptoms worsened.

                                                Immediately Saturday: spacey and throat feels strange; afternoon: body is cold/tired. Sunday: felt great! lots of energy until during a walk at 3pm started to feel spacey (hands feel weird) and spiked a short term fever. Tired and cold. Monday: tired, bottom of lungs burning like I inhaled campfire smoke for a week straight, stumbling over words. Tues: tired, more burning lungs but sensation moving to mid chest (NOT heartburn), feeling like I needed to cough but nothing in lungs, still tired, still struggling with full sentences, irritable. Weds: felt hot but temp was below normal, lungs burning. Took Covid test (negative), incredibly tired, got the spacey feeling and hands felt weird-lasted 30 mins. Thurs: tired, irritable, left side hurt, started having to clear my throat every 20-30 minutes, cold. Fri: still tired, felt like I needed to cough but didn&#39;t reduce the pressure in chest/burnin/aching. Slept 14 hours. Sat: woke up feeling awful. Short of breath, clearing throat all day. Went to urgent clinic. Lab/chest x-ray and EKG all negative. Dr:&#34;Nothing we can do for you. This vaccine is too  new and you are likely having a reaction. Come see us if it gets worse.&#34; I almost cried. When he had me take 4-6 deep breaths to check my lungs with his stethoscope I almost passed out. Now I&#39;m home stuck on the couch under an electric blanket feeling like crap with no relief in sight. Hoping no one else has this ever.

                                                Received the shot at a drive-thru event and then was directed to park in a lot with an EMT squad on standby to wait in my car case of adverse reaction. Due to a prior reaction to vicodin I was asked to wait 30 minutes. I began reading on my phone, and after 10 minutes passed I noticed I was becoming very short of breath and was having difficulty mentally focusing on what I was reading. As this was not an expected reaction, I decided to wait a bit before honking my horn to request assistance. After 5-7 minutes, the feeling went away and my breathing and concentration returned to normal. I waited an additional 30 minutes just in case, but have been fine for the past 6 hours without even a sore arm. Had anything been in bloom in the surrounding area, I would have presumed rolling down my window allowed me to breathe pollen that triggered my allergies, but it is still too early in the spring for that. Weather was 53 F, sunny and dry.

I got the vaccine at 9am.  around 4pm that afternoon i started feeling sick.  by 7:30pm I was in bed thinking I was going die!   By midnight, I got up and tried to walk to the stairs but i was to weak to walk.  I could not sleep.  I was up for 36 hours!  I was nauseous, dizzy, weak, exhausted.  Every inch of my body had pain!!!  I was tingling all over.  I  had the chills until midnight.  My heart would race and then stop... then race again... I was having difficulty breathing!  I tried standing up but I couldn&#39;t.  I would have driven myself to the emergency room but I couldn&#39;t walk.  by noon the next day, my heart regulated, I was able to breath easier.  I was still exhausted and full of pain and tingling.  Today, I still have some pain, but no tingling.

                                                Patient reported:  Difficulty breathing; severe headaches, vomiting/nauseous for 3 weeks and counting, plus chills.  Went to Urgent Care 4.1.21.  Back to Urgent Care 4.9.21 - this time with symptoms above plus cough, SOB, N/V.  CXR (-) COVID (-).  Patient received dose J&amp;J vaccine 3.23.21.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 59 y.o. female who presents to the Urgent Care with COVID-19 (sick after receiving COVID vaccine x1week ago. Vomiting, headaches, nausea, chills)  HPI:  Patient presents today with complaints of nausea, vomiting, headache and chills intermittently over the past 1 week after receiving her 1st COVID 19 vaccination.  She states that she got the Johnson Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.  She states of then she has had an episode of vomiting daily some nausea.  She has also had a headache every single day as well as some constipation.  She denies any numbness or tingling, abdominal pain, diarrhea.  She states that she has been taking ibuprofen, Pepto-Bismol, and Tylenol for her symptoms with minimal relief.  She is drinking a lot of water as well.  Medical Decision Making:  No concerns for acute abdomen or neurological deficits are noted on exam today. Patient is reporting some symptomatic relief after receiving the Toradol injection today in urgent care. Educated the patient on the following: Zofran for nausea and vomiting. MiraLax and senna for any constipation symptoms.  Motrin and Tylenol for pain or fever. Drink plenty of fluids.  Follow up with PCP as needed. If symptoms worsen go to the emergency room such as you are not able to keep fluids down while taking the Zofran, if you develop any bloody stools, bloody vomit, or increasing abdominal pain.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Patient is a 59 y.o. female who presents to the Urgent Care with COUGH (cough, SOB, congestion, vomiting everyday until about 1PM. headache off and on. x 2 weeks (since covid vaccine))     HPI: Patient is a 59 y.o. female who presents to the urgent care with cough, shortness of breath, congestion, nausea and vomiting and intermittent headaches over the past 2 weeks.  Patient states that the symptoms started the day of her COVID vaccine.  She states that she receive the Johnson&amp;Johnson 1 time dose.  She states later that day after receiving the vaccination she had a significant headache that developed.  She states that since then she has had a dry nonproductive cough with intermittent shortness of breath and morning nausea and vomiting that last till about 1:00 p.m..  She states that the headaches have resolved at this time but the cough, intermittent shortness of breath and nausea and vomiting have persisted.  She denies any abdominal pain, chest pain, chest pressure or chest tightness.  She states that she has not been experiencing any dizziness, vision changes or lightheadedness.  She was seen in the urgent care about a week ago and was prescribed Zofran to assist with the nausea.  She states that she was taking it twice in the morning and has now been able to only take it once, does feel that the nausea is improving but was out of the medication today, states that she was not able to take anything today and did have an episode of nonbloody nonbilious vomiting.  She states that she was having some constipation she feels that this was related to the over-the-counter pain medications that she was taking for the headaches.  She states that she was advised to take MiraLax at her last urgent care visit which she has been taking, had a normal bowel movement yesterday.  She states that she has had pneumonia in the past, no history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  With the continued symptoms came to the urgent care for evaluation.  She states that there have been to other coworkers who have had exposure or have now tested positive for COVID-19.  Medical Decision Making:  59-year-old well-appearing female who presents to the urgent care with cough and nausea and vomiting over the past 2 weeks.  Reviewed patient&#39;s previous urgent care notes as well as immunization record.  Her vital signs are stable in the urgent care today and exam is largely benign.  Given her history and current complaints did obtain a chest x-ray which appears negative, formal interpretation was pending at time of discharge.  She was provided Zofran in the urgent care today which she did state helps with the nausea.  Discussed with patient that I do feel that COVID-19 testing should be collected as at the time of her symptoms and given her continued symptoms she has not had full immunity from the vaccination and this could still be a COVID-19 infection.  She is in agreeance and COVID testing is pending.  Prescribed refill of her Zofran as well as Tessalon for cough relief and advised continued symptomatic measures and close follow-up with PCP for any persistent symptoms.  She was provided a work note given her symptoms and COVID-19 testing she was provided the standard COVID-19 work letter.  Patient educated on warning signs and symptoms that would prompt immediate reevaluation. They conveyed understanding and were agreeable to this plan of care. All questions addressed at this time. Pt was non toxic appearing and not in any acute distress upon discharge.

                                                As described above, about 13 hours after the vaccine I woke up at 3 am with a severe pounding and constant headache. I was also extremely fatigued so much so that I did not get out of bed or do anything all day 4/11 and didn&#39;t start feeling better until the following Monday. Then I hear in the news about the 6 adverse reactions and the J&amp;J vaccine shutdown, possibility for blood clots etc. and to keep an eye out for various symptoms over next 2-3 weeks! It was stressful enough registering and not being able to secure the Moderna or Pfizer so I just said ok and got the J&amp;J. Now I have something else to worry about. Heart and blood clot issues are in my family. I do not take any blood thinners and don&#39;t plan to. But now am questioning whether I should have gotten the vaccine at all. I have had enough chronic illness in my life. In fact, December 2019 I was in another town taking care of my mother and her subsequent death when I caught someone&#39;s cough. Urgent care diagnosed me with pneumonia, fluid in the lungs, put me on course of antibiotics. I couldn&#39;t breathe, needed a nebulizer etc. They called me and said it was not pneumonia or flu a or b (I get the shot every year) and to go to the ER if it got worse. I couldn&#39;t eat or move much for three weeks and breathing was extremely difficult. I had to get a nebulizer. Eventually went away. Then in March Covid 19 became official. When I tested for Covid 19 here at a state site in 2021, I tested negative.

Went to bed to sleep it off.  Woke up and the headache was gone the next morning.  Have not had any more headaches.  Experienced muscle soreness in arm of injection and at the injection spot.  Then whole body muscle soreness/heaviness began on April 5th for 3 days.  I had swelling in both legs for only one day, on April 12th. First day I noticed I was experiencing shortness of breath was April 6th.  Became out of breath walking a small incline.  Shortness of breath continues to current, April 16th, perhaps a bit worse, where I seem that a natural breath requires a bit of work. So far, I have no

                                                Eight days after receiving the vaccine, my wife developed shortness of breath, headache, fatigue, and unusual vision problems. She was taken to the emergency room on 4/15 where she underwent a battery of tests (see details below). She was admitted to the hospital (where she currently is) and was diagnosed with blood clots in the lungs and two strokes in the area of the brain that affects vision. She then underwent ultrasound tests of her legs and carotid artery, which were negative for signs of blood clots. Although my wife&#39;s symptoms are different than the symptoms of others that led to the vaccine pause, her doctors strongly encouraged us to report it to the VAERS. My wife had no underlying or pre existing conditions that would lead to blood clots in her lungs, and stroke. After extensive testing there is no evidence that the blood clots in her lungs as well as the clot/clots that went to her brain initiated in her legs. They believe that some sort of &#34;event&#34; would have had to happen to cause these blood clots, and the only unusual thing in the time frame of this condition is the vaccine. As I mentioned earlier, my wife is still hospitalized.

                                                I got the JNJ vaccine on Wed 4/7/21 (a wk before FDA paused that covid vaccine).  Initial response was Extreme Fatigue, but starting 11:45 pm on 4/18/21, I suffered headache, chest pain, short of breath. I could not sleep at all till 4/19/21 PM after asking my kids to pray for me. In case it&#39;s just heartburn, I took TUMS at 8:15 pm  on 4/19/21 . Headache, short of breath comes and goes, but the chest pain persists, and I develop a hot flash.  I never took birth control pills, but my OB/GYN prescribed daily Estrogen (to prevent osteoporosis) and every 3 month, Progesterone for 10 days (to prevent breast cancer). Estrogen &amp; Progesterone happen to be the birth control pills&#39; composition.  On 4/17/21, I finished my 10 days Progesterone regime. I discontinued the Estrogen supplement on 4/19/21 or 4/20/21, now (4/23/21 1:20 am) no more chest pain, but still feel fatigue, feverish with a hazy/foggy head (not really a headache).   I have a suggestion for JNJ, FDA, CDC on JNJ vaccine warning label.   If indeed those 6 women are all on birth control pills which are composed of synthetic estrogen and progesterone, then the warning label should also warn people who take these hormone supplements, instead of just an age range.
