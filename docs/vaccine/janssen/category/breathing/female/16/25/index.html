                                                I got the vaccine at 3:45 arm was sore but I wasn?t worried Later that night around 6 I started feeling disgusting from vaccine so I took an Advil.  Around 8-10pm my body started getting chills, I started shaking, I had a headache my muscles were sore, and I started getting a fever. Around 12am all of the previous symptoms got worse my fever was at about 101 and rising and I was extremely tired. At 1am I felt the worst I have ever felt in my entire life. I could barely walk because my muscles and joints hurt and my fever was over 102.5 and I felt like my veins were on fire. At 2 am I moved to my bathroom because the floor was cold and I didn?t want my roommate seeing me cry from how much pain I was in. I have a high pain tolerance but this was the worst pain I?ve ever been in. In the bathroom I was at the peak of the pain of the vaccine. My fever was over 103 all of my previous side effects were worse than ever I felt weak and a little dizzy. I also was having a hard time breathing, my breathing was weak and I felt like I wasn?t getting enough air. I tried looking up on my phone if I should go to the hospital but I could barely pick up my phone to type or look. I dropped my phone and fell asleep in the floor for 20 minutes before I woke up. I walked slowly over to my bed and took a Tylenol and then had a sip of water and felt like I was going to puke. I tried to use my inhaler and I couldn?t hold my breath to use it. I crawled into bed and slept until 11 the next day and was too sore to walk to class all of my joints still hurt and I had a fever of 101 and a headache . I took a Tylenol and around 6pm my fever broke and I was feeling better. The next day I was still too sore to walk to class and had a headache. Today I am still sore but better my lungs still feel a little tight, I feel unfocused , and I still feel dizzy occasionally. I have no appetite and I feel nauseous when I eat so I?ve been eating in smaller portions . Every single day since the shot I?ve felt very tired. I hope these symptoms get better and Looking back on the night of vaccine I should have gone to the hospital.

                                                She got her J &amp; J vaccine around 4:30 on April 7th ,2021.  She was feeling fine up until around 10:00 that night when she began to have some of the regular side effects in addition to some unusual ones that were more concerning.  She had chills was feverish and nauseous with flu like symptoms of her body aching.  However, at around 10:30 that night she reported having difficulty breathing and having chest pains with pain when she would take breaths. She noticeably was taking very small but frequent breaths due to the pain. She described a pressure on her chest as if there was a bowling ball sitting on top of her chest. She was crying from the pain and her difficulty breathing. She also reported that her throat felt like it was smaller/ constricted.    At that time, she was given Acetaminophen and later around 12:00 she was given Benadryl.  When she went to bed that night, she was in pain but she also reported that her heart was racing and her resting pulse at the time was 110 bpm. She had the flu like symptoms into Thursday evening but by Friday she looked a lot better except for her difficulty breathing with complaints of chest pain when she breaths with continued pressure on her chest.  She rested in bed for most of Friday and on Saturday she got dressed in the afternoon and took a walk around half a mile at which time she was exhausted and felt out of breath.  When she walked back from her destination about a half mile, she needed to rest in bed to recuperate.  The pain while breathing lasted into Sunday. Monday morning, she attempted to run and became winded from running a short distance of ¼ of the block and could not catch her breath having difficulty breathing and throwing up with a lot of subsequent chest pain that day. She was taken to the doctor by 10:00 that morning to run lab tests and get an examination.  She is slowly getting better and taking it easy but Tuesday she still had some pain and by Thursday she is reporting that while the chest pain is still there it is more of a discomfort that she feels when breathing as compared to pain.  She continues to report the discomfort when breathing till today 4/16/21 and is still limiting her physical activity but going about her daily routine.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine, my left arm was shooting pain and cramped up. That faded after a couple minutes and I felt fine afterwards. Starting at 7:00PM (April 6/same day), I suddenly felt extremely dizzy, nauseous, and my entire body is aching to the point of tears. My lower abdomen and spine/hips are also in terrible pain. I?m in too much pain to sleep even though I?m exhausted and for a little while, I was struggling to catch my breath. I also have chills and feel that a fever is not far off.

                                                She had no history of anaphylaxis from any cause, she had no history of reactions to vaccines or components.  After about 5 minutes I checked on her and she said she was feeling very dizzy.  I called management for assistance and got her ice packs for neck and forehead. I took her blood pressure and it was 150/90, HR 73. We laid her down and elevated her legs.  She said that she felt some pressure in her chest but she had pulled a muscle there the day before and wasn&#39;t sure if it was related.  She said the room was spinning as she continued to lay on the ground and it was not improving.  Her blood pressure was taken about 5 minutes later and it was 143/85 HR 73.  She said it is usually low.   She had no signs of local reaction, hives, or swelling.  She complained of nausea.  After a few more minutes she said she was not feeling any better and was having pain in her throat and difficulty breathing.  I asked her to try to take a deep breath and she was gasping for air, unable to breathe deeply.  I administered epinephrine (one dose) and called 911.  I rechecked blood pressure while waiting for paramedics and it was 125/80.  She was taken to hospital when they arrived.  Her mom arrived shortly before the ambulance and went with her.  Pt never lost consciousness.  Management followed up with patient this evening and patient is home and well, but the ER did classify the event as an allergic reaction.

                                                On 4/8/2021 I developed a headache after receiving the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I took the next few days easy, and laid in bed for the majority of the weekend. On 4/10/2021 I left my residence to get dinner and noticed I was short of breath just walking from the building to my car. The shortness of breath worsened over the next few days. On 4/13/2021 I called a clinic and told them I had been short of breath and they directed me to the ER. I arrived to the ER around 2:30 in the afternoon. They ordered a chest x-ray and ran a test to determine if I could have a blood clot. The test came back with results indicating I could have a blood clot, so they did a chest CT and an MRI. The chest CT showed a blood clot in my left pulmonary artery. They prescribed a blood thinner, told me to stop taking oral birth control, and discharged me.

                                                Pt&#39;s throat and tongue and jaw felt like it was swelling. She had extreme pain in her arm and her hands started swelling. She got a rash on her arms and on her hands. I took her to the urgent care facility and they gave her a shot of Decadron and a shot of Benadryl. They also Prescribed steroids. She was very sick like she had a severe flu. I was very worried as her mother. She was weak and slept constantly. Her arm could barely move and It almost appears as if she had had a stroke. She had brain fog and she wasn&#39;t remembering her days like she was missing memory. After five days, the reaction started up again so we took her to the emergency room. They did a variety of tests including a urinalysis, CT of the brain, ECG 12 lead, peripheral venous duplex of her upper arm. Everything checked out OK so they put her on more steroids and sent her home. Pt is still having arm pain a month later but finally feels better.

                                                Started out with a headache and dizziness within a few minutes of the vaccine, along with nausea. I stayed put laying down with a lollipop and water bottle along with ice packs on me for about an hour until I was well enough they thought for me to drive back to my dorm. Once I started driving the headache was back but I was driving so I couldn?t do much. Almost pulled over because I was getting over whelmed but ended up making it back to my dorm. Once I got back I changed and laid down in bed hoping to fell better. Things started getting worse from there. Throughout the rest of the day my head ache and dizziness got worse to the point where I was pretty unsteady on my feet. Chills and body aches also started and progressed rapidly despite no fever.  My nausea was present in waves but eventually dissipated around 8 PM.  I tried to go to bed around 11 hoping to sleep off the symptoms. I began tossing and turning. My chills were really bad and it got to the point where my skin was so sensitive that the clothes I was wearing touching and rubbing against my skin were hurting me. I was so dizzy and light headed to the point where it didn?t matter if I was laying down or sitting up, I felt the same, extremely dizzy and lightheaded as if cotton were in my brain or as if it were working too slow. It was like trying to process thoughts through molasses. Then around 1:30 I couldn?t take it anymore and thought maybe a quick shower would help me to at least feel better so I could sleep. When I got in the shower I immediately knew things were worse.  My vision started going black at the edges and black spots in the middle to the point where at certain moments I couldn?t see. I was fighting to stay on my feet and conscious and it was hurting to breathe. I knew I needed to get help so I stumbled to my dorm and collapsed when I got in the doorway to my room. My vision was spotty, my chest was hurting and I could barely breathe.  My hands and feet went numb as well, I was shivering, and my body temperature was a little down to about 98.1 degrees Fahrenheit.   I was transported to a hospital via ambulance my vitals were normal except elevated heart rate and O2 and  was admitted at 2:40 in the morning. I received a chest x ray and  my heart rate was better.  The dizziness was under control by then. I was discharged at 4:50 in the morning.

                                                It was around 5:00-6:00 PM when I started to feel very lightheaded all the time and had bad muscle aches. It got to the point where if I did anything but lay down, I would feel lightheaded and off balance. The worst happened at 3:00 AM on 4/10/2021 (the day after) when I got up to use the bathroom. I was washing my hands afterwards and nearly passed out. I couldn&#39;t hear, I couldn&#39;t see, and it was a bit difficult to breath. Luckily I knew what all of this meant and I sat down and took deep breaths until I felt fine again.

At 8:00 chills started, along with a feeling of all my muscles contracting , lost the ability for fine motor control and  fell asleep at 9.pm. Woke up at 12:45am covered in sweat feeling as if I was burning with a splitting heavy headache, had fever, don?t know temperature new house so no thermometer but it sucked. dunked head in sink. Legs could barely support me so I couldn?t go down the stairs for pain medication, went back to bed. Got cold washcloth at 1:00am pain felt pretty unbearable, couldn?t make it downstairs or move at this point so I spent night in and out of sleep unable to move. Muscles still feel like rocks and my head feels like it?s stuffed with a mixture of Vaseline and nitroglycerin, every time I move it feels like my brains smashing into my skull with little explosions. Recent development within the last 5-6 hours maybe?(3:00-4:00pm) centralized over my breast bone feels incredibly painful, hurts to breath and feels like something heavy is pressing it through my chest into my spine. Not sure what to do or if this is normal but it hurts really really bad. Accurate hours because I was lucidly texting my friends to make sure I wouldn?t pass out, so I have nearly exact hours when each symptom appeared till I could no longer use my fingers.

Mother reports that she had the vaccine, had no symptoms, and then started with a fever that evening of 103.  She was having cold extremities, numbness, tingling of the arms, face, legs.  The fever dropped and went away and was having fatigue and getting winded doing regular activities.  By Monday she continued with the shortness of breath and go increasingly worse as the days went on and also the.  By Wednesday she was having chest pain, numbness and tingling of her extremities and shortness of breath.  She went to the hospital, gave her IVs, says her BP was elevated and sent her home.  Mother told her to sleep and see how she felt.  By Thursday night 4/15/21 she screamed out because she was having chest pains and having chest and pains and not able to straighten out her hand and could not catch her breath.  She was then taken back to the hospital and said that she her BP was high and said that she had the Janssen vaccine, and said that she was hyperventilation due to anxiety.  Once they got her stable and released her again.  Mother asked the doctor if he felt that this was normal, and could see her throat contracting and that she was stable and to go home, and he said yes and that it was anxiety and that sometimes we get ourselves worked up about things and that was causing it.    The daughter has no history of anxiety, no breathing issues.   They did labs and everything was okay, her counts were somewhat off but nothing felt to be abnormal.      She then went to another Hospital as she was still not feeling well, and checked the other reports from the other hospital and they conferred with that information, gave her Valium and sent her home.    As the evening progressed on Friday 4/16/21 she started having chest pains and her girlfriends mother is a nurse and came and saw her and called the mother and told her that she did not like how she was looking, and that her SOB and weakness in her extremities and the tightness in her chest was not right and that she felt that she had a PE.    They took her to another location, she had extremely high calcium levels, and high blood pressure and her heart rate was high and she was admitted.  She has been on flushes to reduce calcium, and her blood levels are improving.  She is on Warfarin to prevent clotting.  She has had a CAT scan and other studies and all were negative.  She felt better yesterday, but she states today that she is not feeling as well, she is nauseous and gave her Zofran,  has a headache, and they gave her something a little stronger than Tylenol.  She is extremely fatigued and weak.    Mother said that she saw her on Sunday 4/18/21 and that she was not able to walk, they had to put her in a wheelchair, and her grandfather walks faster than she can.    They are presently getting her up to get her to walk and see how her strength is, 4/20/21.  They are now waiting to get her levels under control and to see if she is strong enough to go home.  Neurology released her from their standpoint as they did not see anything, but she is to FU with them afterwards and want to do EMG&#39;s as an out patient.

                                                The patient passed out for a few seconds about 5 minutes after the vaccine administration. She was very clammy, sweaty, and alert but very groggy when the pharmacists went out to  her. She also stated that her throat felt swollen and sore and that she felt like she was going to throw up. We called the EMS, and she left in the ambulance about 25 minutes after being vaccinated. We don&#39;t have any further update at this time.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. About 1am I woke up short of breath. I sat up in bed to catch my breath and immediately felt nauseous. I went to the bathroom because I thought I was going to throw up but only ended up dry heaving. After sitting for a minute to catch my breath again I started shaking really bad and couldn&#39;t stand up without having blacked out vision. Luckily I grabbed my phone when I went to the bathroom so my mom could come home to help me. Until about 5 am I was shaking going between being extremely hot and extremely cold. After that my body SEVERE:Y ached all day with off and on sweats and headaches. I took Tylenol all day. I started feeling better with just some fatigue around 6pm.

                                                I got the vaccine Tuesday evening and felt fine until Wednesday morning when I got a migraine and a fever. Thursday I felt mostly fine just some tiredness and a little weakness. Friday evening I started to feel light headed and then by Friday night I felt a lump in my throat and my neck felt like it was burning. The burning continued into Saturday. I went to the pharmacist and he told me to take some Tylenol and an antihistamine. That helped a lot with the burning feeling. Sunday I felt very weak all day and felt more of a slight tightness in my throat. Monday the weakness and tightness in the throat continued just not as extreme.

                                                I received the shot at 14:30, in which medical staff in the jail&#39;s medical center watched me for 20 minutes to ensure there were no immediate reactions. I went about my day afterward with no symptoms. At 21:30 when I went to sleep, I got some aches in my joints and took 1 dose of liquid capsule NyQuil to help with the pain and went to sleep. At 00:30, the 7th, I woke up groaning in my sleep to the extreme pain in my joints and feeling hot internally. I decided to get up and take a warm bath to ease the aches. I went and ran the bath and all of a sudden while it was running, I had a severe need to throw up, but could not naturally. Since this was concerning, I got up and walked out of the bathroom and all of a sudden in the hall I got a feeling of impending doom and that something was not right and I fainted. I laid on the floor for what I would approximate to be 5 minutes going in and out of consciousness waiting for the blood to fully return to the brain. After this, I instantly felt like I needed to survive and that I felt like I could be dying so I slowly crawled down the stairs to get to my military ID so I could call the military&#39;s nurse advice line. I had to take a break and lay on the concrete in my garage because I felt so dizzy and so hot and began to feel my vision disappear like I was going to faint again. I waited a few minutes before getting back up the stairs crawling to my phone to call. When I called them 00:58, they told me to call 911 because they believed I would be having a severe reaction, though I noted to them I did not have a rash or hives. I then called 911 at 01:08. They sent EMT&#39;s to my home which took my vitals. I had normal blood pressure, SPo2, and temp, but an elevated heart rate of just under 100 and a high respiration rate. EMT&#39;s made the decision for me to stay home since the hospital did not seem immediate in their opinion. After this I stayed on the couch for a few minutes and then felt very tired so I walked slowly to my room and fell asleep. I woke up at 06:00 for work, and arrived at 07:00. In the hour after waking up I was achy, sweating, and felt light headed. I got to work and my Sergeant told me to go home and sleep. I slept another 5 hours at 08:00 and when I woke up most of my symptoms went away other than aches and getting flush very easily for 5 days.  At this current time all I notice is some random light headedness that quickly resolves and comes a few times a day at random and without cause.

On April 12th I had a fever and woke up with red little dots around my eyes.  At night the fever went away. The following day April 13th I felt my chest tight and had shortness of breath throughout the day. I also had stomach pains at times.  April 14th and 15th (today) my chest still feels tight and I get tired very easily.  My arm is also still very sore and sensitive, I have a little bump where the vaccine was put in.

                                                Immediately after receiving the shot I began to have fairly intense pain at injection site. It continued in waves. I began to walk around the store for the allotted 15 minutes. I began to feel very dizzy and faint. My ears began ringing and I didn?t feel well. I stumbled back to the pharmacy to ask for help. At this point I was also feeling like it was very hard to breathe. I explained all these symptoms to the pharmacists on duty and they told me to just sit down. After sitting down I still felt faint but suddenly felt the need to vomit. I stumbled to the bathroom where I collapsed in front of the toilet and passed out twice, striking my head and throat on the bowl. After awaking I was very disoriented and felt very hot and clammy. The pharmacist then came and found me and told me to once again sit down and continue waiting. After sitting down for about 5 more minutes I began to feel less dizzy and was having an easier time breathing. I left the store as the pharmacist was ignoring me and didn?t seem concerned about my symptoms. After arriving home I was tired and week and very very cold. I noted my body temp was lower than usual. I took a nap and then these symptoms continued for about 24 hours. I am now feeling much better.

                                                It seemed to be an allergic reaction about an hour after the vaccine - throat partially swelling up, difficulty breathing, severe headache, and fatigue for a few days.   The first reaction lasted half an hour. After taking two Benadryl tablets and Abuterol every four hours, the throat swelling calmed down. I still had difficulty breather for the following two days, but my Abuterol kept it at bay.

Shortly felt a burning feeling in my chest and  collar bones, that spread to my head. My head started to burn, it felt like it was on fire, along with my neck and chest. I felt dizzy, like i was going to faint, the burning and dizziness lasted for about 5 minutes. Shortly after i felt like my throat closed up and I was having very labored breaths. The burning feeling in my body and dizziness came back, along with not feeling like i could breathe well. I went to an ER, they gave me an IV with Benadryl, and I started to feel well enough 2 hours later to go home.

                                                Got the shot at 9:20am on Saturday (April 10th). By the time I sat down to do the 15min waiting period before I could leave. My arm from the back of my shoulder all the way down to around my thumb joint in my hand ached so bad. By around 3pm on the same day, I started to feel really tired and had a pounding migraine. By 4:30p I started to get really cold and everything started to ache. By 6p I was feeling hot but at the same time cold and shivering. My head was pounding. Every muscle ached all over my body, and by every muscle I mean even my eye muscles and pelvic floor muscles. My face had so much sinus pressure that it felt like it could explode. My skin, all over my body, was so sensitive that it hurt to the touch. On top of my skin being sensitive to the touch, off and on my skin would tingle, including the inside of my mouth and tongue. My lymph nodes were swollen enough in my neck that my throat ached.  I was mentally confused and shaking. Everything got bad enough I started crying and hyperventilating. I felt sick to my stomach and felt digestive pain. My entire body felt so heavy. By the time it got to around 8p, my mom finally took my temperature, which at that point I had already been taking Tylenol all day and was no longer shivering, and I had a temperature of 101 degrees F. I finally went to bed around 9p. I was thirsty but my stomach felt sick. I still ached and woke up around 10 times throughout the night either feeling too hot or cold or hurting so bad. At 4am I took a Tylenol because it everything hurt bad enough to able to fall asleep. The next day. I mostly better. I was still tired and a little achy and my lymph nodes under my arm pits were swollen. At this point my lungs felt strange. Harder to breathe than normal.  I was starting to cough. The day after that (today) I have felt fairly normal except I?m coughing and my lungs still feel a little strained. No more aches or fever or anything like that though.

                                                I was running on the treadmill and all of the sudden my feet started tingling. I got off the treadmill to try to massage my feet. Then, I felt nauseous and vomited. After vomiting I could not move and I had very hard time walking. I noticed that my face had swollen, my throat was closing, and my vision was blurry. I also broke out in hives. Once I could get mobile (about two hours after the adverse reaction started) I took a Benadryl and that helped ease the swelling.

Passed out, unconscious within 5 minutes of receiving the shot. Could not sit up/dizzy for 30 minutes. Nausea, weakness, dizzy, poor mental acuity/memory. Later that night, and through the night for 10 hours, severe back pain. Nausea, severe weakness, dizzy, poor mental acuity and memory, sweats and chills.  The next day (day immediately after receiving vaccine) symptoms continued but lessened by 5 pm. Each day since then, the symptoms have ALL remained in a more mild form. Today is day 6 and I still have moderate back pain and occasional sweats, weakness and fatigue.

For a short period of time, the left side of my lips (upper and lower), and my left hand went numb. These adverse side effects lasted about 15 hours.

                                                Approximately 4 hours after receiving the vaccine, I started getting full body chills which quickly turned into full body shakes. The shaking felt like tremors and made it hard to breathe.  The uncontrollable shaking and chills lasted approx. 3 hours and then I fell asleep. The next morning (approx. 12 hours after the vaccine) I no longer had body shakes but experienced flu-like symptoms (headache, tired, week) for the rest of the day. I also experienced severe pain in my lower back. By the next day (approx. 36 hours after the vaccine) I was back to normal and have felt fine since.

On Wednesday I went to the Hospital and for chest pain (when I would breathe in), shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, and a fever (on Monday). They rain many tests with chest scans and found all to be clear except I had a ?extremely elevated? white blood cell count. They said they ran blood tests and did not think I had blood clots and they did an MRI and chest x-ray and could not find anything. They sent me home to rest. The rest of the week I had trouble breathing and it slowly started getting better on Friday.

After 2 hours, I started experiencing severe body aches (primarily in my knees and back) and a headache, my body temperature felt as thought it was changing from cold to hot frequently, and my temperature rose to 103.6 for about 1.5-2 hours. It finally decreased to about 102 and remained there for about 6 more hours. I had trouble getting up to use the restroom and would feel very dizzy, my temperature dropped midday to about 100. My fever finally broke about 24 hours after my vaccine, but I still lost my appetite and was experiencing body aches and a headache. I couldn&#39;t eat anything for about 48 hours after my vaccine, I was able to take small sips of water to help stay hydrated. It took until Saturday (5 days after my vaccine) to feel back to normal. I felt very puffy and swollen the entire week following my vaccine and was very fatigued.

On March 16th, I woke up around 6 am with moderate to severe swelling of the face, eyes, hands, and feet. My throat was also closing and it was becoming difficult to breathe. I treated with 50mg of Benadryl every 6 hours for the next 3 days. The next day, March 17th, my left eye became red and inflamed. The eye symptoms and face puffiness subsided ~March 19th.

                                                Symptoms from vaccine: low fever, intense headache, extreme fatigue, very sore arm (couldn&#39;t lift arm for a few days), tingling sensation in left arm/hand/leg that would come and go, would get winded easily, chills, sweats. Most of the symptoms lasted 3-4 days but the extreme fatigue and sore arm lasted for a week. Symptoms were similar to when I had covid, but was surprised that some symptoms lasted a full week. Had to take off work for a few days.

                                                About six hours after my shot I started having shortness of breath and heart palpitations. I went to the ER and they  gave me some fluids and testing and I was discharged the next day. I had a mild heart arrhythmia which was not present two days later when I went to the doctor. I had a little shortness of breath and experienced a few heart palpitations for a week after the vaccine. I have not had any more since then.

                                                Night of vaccine had severe body aches, back pain, leg pain severe until legs went numb, then arm pain severe until also numb, chest pains/ trouble breathing.  Following days had pains in arms and legs as if a tourniquet was left on and I cycled through severe pain and being numb. 5 days in I lost my vision (super blurry and seeing double) and lost complete control of arms and legs on top of headache and chest pains. Vision came back a couple hours later but the leg pains/ numbness continued even now. It feels as if my circulation has been cut off.
