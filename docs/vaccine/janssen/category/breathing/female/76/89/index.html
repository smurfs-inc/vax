Patient states she has been on the ground in the room for 3 days, she was found covered in feces.  Alert and oriented x4 however intermittently appears confused and has varying history.  She does not know how she got on the ground, however denies fall or syncope.  No significant current complaints.  Slightly tachycardic and febrile, slightly hypertensive, exam without any significant acute findings, no obvious skin source of ulcer or infection, no focal neurological deficits, no pain.  Initiated aggressive fluid hydration and sepsis work-up.  EKG appears normal with no signs of ischemia or arrhythmia.  Labs show slightly elevated troponin, low magnesium, metabolic/lactic acidosis.  VBG relatively normal.  Urine negative for infection chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia, no clinical signs or symptoms to identify source of infection.  Nothing to suggest meningitis at this time.  CT head is negative.  Unclear source of fever however empirically treated with antibiotics and fluids.  Patient remains hemodynamically stable with no hypotension.  She did arrive slightly hypoxic and with increased respiratory rate however clear lung sounds and no indications of heart failure, COPD/asthma.  CT chest without evidence of pulmonary embolism, focal pneumonia, or fluid overload.  Respiratory status possibly related to compensation for metabolic acidosis that is likely due to lack of fluid intake due to being on the ground.  CK is normal and kidney function is normal.  Consulted medicine for admission for further evaluation and treatment.  Cardiology was also consulted for NSTEMI, agrees with current plan.   per H&amp;P 4/28/21:   Altered mental status (R41.82): Etiology is not clear. Patient states she had J&amp;J Covid vaccine about 3 weeks ago. Need to rule out cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Get a CT scan of the brain with contrast. If negative will get CT venogram or MRV and MRI of the head. Neuro checks. Request PT OT and speech therapy evaluation. Check urine drug screen. Check blood alcohol level.    Non-STEMI (non-ST elevated myocardial infarction) (I21.4): Start argatroban drip until cerebral vein sinus thrombosis is excluded then we can switch to heparin drip. Start aspirin and statin. Check fasting lipid panel. Monitor on telemetry. Trend troponin. Request echocardiogram. Cardiology to consult.

Rhabdomyolysis (M62.82): Hydrate and recheck CPK.    Elevated liver enzymes (R74.8): Check hepatitis panel. Monitor levels.    Fever (R50.9): No clear source of infection. Follow up on blood cultures.   CT chest negative for infectious process. Check CT of the abdomen and pelvis.Start empiric antibiotics: Vancomycin and Zosyn.    Hypomagnesemia (E83.42): Administer magnesium sulfate. Repeat level in the morning.    Diabetes (E11.9): Start sliding scale insulin. Monitor fingersticks. Hypoglycemic protocol.  Check hemoglobin A1c.    Hypertension (I10): Fortunately patient is hemodynamically stable. We will cautiously start metoprolol. Adjust antihypertensives to optimal blood pressure control.    Acidosis, lactic (E87.2): Likely due to profound volume depletion. Rule out sepsis. Hydrate and trend level.

We will keep n.p.o. overnight for TEE tomorrow. Repeat blood culture from 4/30/2021 just came back positive for Enterococcus.  Suspect endocarditis due to TAVR.  ? need for TEE to evaluate the valves (TAVR) more closely.  Duration of antibiotics depends on bacterial clearance: To be determined.  Get another set of cultures.  On Zosyn.  per attending note 5/4/21:  Enterococcal bacteremia (R78.81): Etiology not entirely clear but suspect GI source or endocarditis.  Repeat blood culture from 4/30/2021 is positive for Enterococcus.  PCP he is accepting to follow-up for IV antibiotics management: Will arrange home IV infusion through  care .  Antibiotics end date to be determined: Pending bacterial clearance.  Repeat blood cultures pending.  Infectious disease specialist following: Patient is currently on Unasyn. Will need 4 weeks of IV antibiotics.

Visited primary doctor who urged her to visit ED. On ED visit on 3/4/21, she was found to be in afib RVR (heart rate to 170s) that was refractory initially to dilt push, dilt oral, dilt gtt. On 3/7/21, stroke alert was called because of new right arm dis-coordination, and on 3/8/21, MR brain showed an acute right cerebellar artery infarct (which did not leave deficits). Prior to the vaccine, pt had absolutely no symptoms of heart failure or cardiac diagnoses. She was hospitalized from 3/4/21-3/13/21, 3/18/21-3/23/21 for afib RVR, congestive heart failure, and acute kidney injury which required dilt and diuretics. However, she was later hospitalized on 4/8/21-4/11/21 again for afib RVR, congestive heart failure and acute kidney injury. Finally after continued outpatient amiodarone, she returned to normal sinus rhythm.
