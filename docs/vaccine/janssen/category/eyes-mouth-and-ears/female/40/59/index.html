                                                Dizzy, run down two hours after injection. Woke up 4 am then off and on with extreme body pain, sore neck , lower back, right hand and arm. Headache and fatigue at 6:45 am got up with two children (2 yrs and 10 months) ate small breakfast by 9 am I couldn?t get off the couch or stay awake. My head started aching and my eyes hurt, I felt extreme chills two thick blankets weren?t enough to warm me. Extreme fatigue, stomach pain and loss of appetite. I fell asleep and didnt have the energy to walk to my bed until 2:30 pm.  It set off my stomach and I was vomiting off and on until around 9 pm. By then I could keep little bits of fluid and food down. Then I was hot. I felt flushed but had no fever. My usual heart rate is 52-54 bpm via Watch while laying down. My heart rate during this hot period laying in bed was 102 -101 bpm. Which is consistent for my workout heart rate. I went to sleep and woke up 7 am with my kids and was well enough to take care of them but not do all my usual chores. I couldn?t bend down or put my head lower than chest or the extreme throbbing headache was back. Still had body aches and fatigue but nowhere near yesterday. It is 11:22 pm Sunday and I feel spent.

                                                A few seconds after vaccine was given I had a sensation go up my left jawline that felt similar to a nerve pain.  I didn&#39;t think much of it and waited the 10 minutes after my vaccine and had no other symptoms.  I left the pharmacy and started driving home and had a sudden sensation of a heaviness in my chest and trouble taking a deep breath.  I also felt like my tongue and throat were swelling slightly.  I had a warm sensation throughout the middle of my back that felt like a heating pad was on it.  I felt light-headed and called my husband.  As I continued to drive my symptoms worsened and I called 911.  I made it home in my car and the ambulance met me there.  My husband called the pharmacy to ask them what we should do and they said that it would be ok for him to give me Benadryl.  I took 15mL of liquid Benadryl shortly before the ambulance arrived.   Within 15-20 minutes, I felt like I was able to swallow better.  In the ER, I received IV Benadryl and Famotidine.  I was also given 800mg of Ibuprofen for a bad headache I developed.  My oxygen level remained in the high 90&#39;s and my symptoms were much improved after the IV medication.  I was instructed to continue taking Benadryl capsules for the next few days along with Pepcid to keep my symptoms from flaring back up.  I noticed this morning when waking up that the left side of my face as well as my throat felt odd so I took the Pepcid and Benadryl and symptoms were relieved in 30 mins or so.

                                                My vaccine was administered at 12:30pm. I waited until 12:55 at CVS after the vaccine to make sure there were no reactions. I also move my arm around a lot after the injection to keep it from hurting. I drove home, at lunch and about 2:45 was hit with a very noticeable headache. I never get headaches and eat healthy and consume about a gallon of water a day. I knew it wasn&#39;t from dehydration or being hungry.  Headache was in the temple area and made my eyes hurt in the same way they would if you had cried for an extended period of time or were overtired. At 3pm a wave of exhaustion hit me. I was sitting working trying to combat the headache and felt almost wiped out. I got through the rest of my work day (4:30) and went to lay down immediately. I passed out almost instantly until 7 pm. I work up and showered, ate dinner and started to feel a little warm. It should be noted it was an unseasonably warm day and got up to 77, so it was a tiny bit warm in my home. I put on loose fitting clothes and slayed on the couch still with the bad headache and the injection site started to throb so I placed and ice pack on for 20 minutes. I could only stay awake until 8:45 and got in bed. I could not get comfortable for several hours feeling very warm. I tried a fan on high and drinking more water but i felt very warm like how you feel with the flu. I took my temp at 1130pm it was normal. I continued to toss and turn and feel very warm and slightly dizzy, in the sense that I hadn&#39;t been able to sleep and with the headache my body was just exhausted. Around 2 am i woke up for more water and got in the shower because I had sweated so much my sheets were wet and my clothes. I got out of the shower around 10 minutes later, changed and got new sheets and got back in bad. Around 330 I felt very hot again and opened the windows and got another ice pack for my arm which was throbbing again. I finally fell asleep after 3:45am. I got up for work at 6am. I felt slightly foggy, and very hot. But no fever. My temp is normally around 97.4-97.9 and it was 98.4. Still normal but I was running warmer than usual. It took a long time to get ready and despite hot water in the shower I was freezing. i got dress and debated going to work. Got in the car at 6:45 and my drive to work is 30 minutes. 1/2 way into my drive I got very sweaty again and went home to change my clothes because they were too warm. Got to work around 7:20 and still felt warm but they take our temps at the door and min was still okay, no fever. I drank a lot of water and ate, and at 8:30 am all of a sudden the exhaustion was gone and I felt normal. I got home form work at 5:30p and took a 3 hour nap and felt normal again.

                                                Had a sore arm within hour of shot (got it at 7:30pm). Felt a little yucky before going to bed. I made sure to hydrate significantly before the shot and after. I woke up at 3am with chills and had them for about an hour.  Woke up the next morning at 9am with with medium neck and head pain and feeling a little chilly and out of it. Mild ache in joints and body overall. At 10am I took one ibuprofen, but at 11am (200mg), kept pushing fluids. 11am headache got worse temp 98.7 (slightly high for me, I am usually about 97). Started having some gastrointestinal issues around noon. Felt nausea and sweaty palms loss of appetite. Had a bowel movement (normal in appearance).    That all seemed to pass and I felt better, still tired, for most of the afternoon. Arm was sore to the touch and when moving. I managed to eat a few small meals, kept up hydration, and took a nap late in the day. I woke up at 5pm with headache and body aches all over. No appetite again. Had very little to eat, kept hydrating,    At 7pm my vision got a little blurry and I had a minor vasovagal episode. Center of vision blurred, got chills and sweaty, nausea, and I had to poop  (it was less formed). I rested, cool compress, and raised my feet. It all passed in about 20 minutes. I had major loss of appetite rest of the night (couldn&#39;t eat anything), kept hydrating, and went to bed.  Slept through the night with no incidents.   Woke up at 9am second day and had a small breakfast, though my appetite is still not back. Generally feeling exhausted, but no headache or aches in the body anymore. My arm is still sore. Had some more GI distress (another less formed poop around 11am).   My appetite returned by early afternoon on the 2nd day post-vaccine. Still tired and generally feeling &#34;off,&#34; especially mentally. Had brain fog all afternoon and my ears felt plugged today. Hard to concentrate on a task.

                                                Seizure-like incident while at a restaurant. Eyes rolled back in to my head, according to my friend who was with me. My vision got blurry, I started feeling nauseous, shivers, cold sweats, body felt shaky, and at first I thought I had been drugged. This &#34;attack&#34; lasted for a couple of minutes. After being able to get home I was in bed until 4 pm the next day. At first I had several hours where I was freezing despite being in bed fully dressed with the heat blasting, the following hours, I was sweating. I had a headache, felt nauseous, and uncomfortable all day Saturday. My reaction to the vaccine was much worse than having Covid-19. Missed work due to the symptoms from getting the vaccone.

                                                On April 8th at 4am, I woke up feeling a strong pain in my heart / esophagus region. I was alone and out of town and didn&#39;t know what to do, so I just sat in the hotel bed and waited for morning to come. I didn&#39;t know if i was having a heart attack or if it was gas from drinking soda the previous day. I went to work. At work, the left side of my tongue suddenly started swelling and a tingling and numbness set in my upper lip. I was very scared, rushed to the drugstore and bought GasX, Ricola drops (my throat was slightly sore, too) and Allegra 24 hours. I immediately took the Allegra pill but still went to the hospital. When getting to the parking of the hospital, though, the anti-allergic started kicking in and the tongue started getting back to normal, so I went back to work and didn&#39;t enter the hospital. I was ok for a while. Hours later, rashes started showing all over my body. Starting in my arms then under my breasts. On the night of the 8th, I even had fever and chills. Still, I had to go to work so it was a real nightmare. I also had diarreah. I then went to the drugstore again and also bought regular and night Advil, lots of water and electrolytes drink, Peptobismol and Benadryl (only Allegra was not enough). The following day, April 9th, the rashes started spreading all over my body, the fever was only being controlled by Advil. I flew back to Miami and was bedridden until the April the 11th. On the night of April the 11th I still woke up with very strong headache and on the 12th spent the day with a headache, but since have gotten better.

                                                I went on Sunday March, 14, 2021  to get the Johnson and Johnson shot offered through the school system.  I noticed that my blurred vision intensified.  I went to the eye doctor 3/16 and that is where they found blood clots behind my right eye close to my center.  I was referred to a Retinol specialist 3/26/21 and sent me to get  a physical to check for diabetes.  It had started to heal a little. There was not clear diagnosis on what could have been causing the the blood behind my eye.  4/2/2021 Went for physical at PCP and results of physical was good with no Diabetes.

Experienced heart racing/rapid pulse and could feel /hear pulsing and whooshing noise in my ears. Was unable to sleep. Muscle and join pain continued and was noticeable for about two days post vaccine. Migraine became a mild headache by mid morning. About 6 pm took a Bayer Back and Body for the lingering joint/muscle/headache issue (24&#43; after vaccine).  -Loss of appetite first few days post vaccine. -Feeling of brain fog, difficulty concentrating, very noticeable during first two weeks. -For two and half weeks following the vaccine, felt bouts of fatigue, muscle aches and joint pain, and occasional whooshing noise in my ears.

I took Tylenol everyday for my sore arm and the headaches but it did help suppress them so I didn?t think much of it. My throat also started to feel kind of raw or itchy but I didn?t have a cough and I noticed a slight post nasal drip. Ok the 10th in the evening I felt exhausted and my face and sinuses were much worse. I took cold medicine and fell asleep early but had a hard time sleeping. I?m a side sleeper and if I turned on my left side, my ear felt like it was burning and my face would go numb. It also made me very dizzy. I woke up with body aches and light headed. My throat doesn?t hurt but it feels different. Almost numb like nothing and I can?t smell or taste.

                                                Exactly an hour after recieving the shot, I started horribly itching from head to toe and had a red rash. I took 2 zyrtec. The allergy meds helped but once they wore off I would start itching. Two days after the shot my face got really puffy especially around the eyes. For six days I took 2 Zyrtec in the morning and 1 benadryl at night. After 6 days of the allergy meds I finally was back to normal.

                                                She got the vaccine she was fine, had a mild cramping in her stomach.  She wakes up at 5:00 AM in the morning for work and on Friday she could not put her feet on the ground for pain in her legs.  She also had a bad headache on the left side and took Advil for that, and then the headache switched to the right side.  She then took another Advil, and that was all she took that day and was that way the whole weekend.  She had pain all weekend and could not touch herself as the pain was so bad.  She also had chills, nauseated, her vision was going in and out as if she was at the eye doctors office.  Her uncle brought her mother over to her as she could not take care of herself or drive to take care of her cousin who she takes care of.  She went to go work on Monday 3/26/21  then she started having difficulty breathing  and her employer called the EMT&#39;s, they checked her heart rate which was high and did her oxygen level which was fine, and were afraid she may have gone into cardiac arrest, and told her to rest.  She called her doctor who told her that it was a bad reaction to the vaccine.   She is still having difficulty breathing after walking so far, she weighs 115# and has always been a small person.  She was not given any medications by her doctor and told her to rest and if it worsened to call her back.    She had been seen two weeks prior by her doctor for a sinus infection and was given an allergy shot and some other injection of which she does not know what it was, possibly a steroid.

With history of panic attacks we observed closely.  After 25 minutes, and symptoms getting worse, we decided it was best to administer epi-pen and called 911.  Symptoms got a bit better after a minute. After about 7 minutes another epi-pen was administered as symptoms were starting to get worse again.

As the minutes passed, the feeling of fullness was more pronounced. We offered EPI-PEN and to call 911. Patient wanted 911 only. We called 911, took her blood pressure (188/119). Paramedics arrived within 1 minute. After examination, patient was transported to hospital at 1:30p.m. accompanied by family members. At 3:55p.m.,  I spoke to her fiancé to inquire about her well being. She was still at ER at 3:55 p.m. She was given Benadryl, EpiPen, and Prednisone. Fiancé said she was breathing better but there was a rash and itching at injection site which was being treated with Benadryl and Prednisone. Fiancé said patient was frustrated at having to be at emergency room.

                                                I experienced slight nausea, awake all night, felt like a stimulant to me, fever, chills, sweating, migraines. I felt super tired but my body would not let me sleep. I also had muscle aches and cramps with lower back and leg with a throbbing sensation. This was within 12 hours. About 5 days later, my eye started to hurt, went to se my eye doctor and they found out I have ocular herpes. I am on now on some antiviral eye medication. I could tell after the vaccine I had a viral type infection. I still have not recovered and I will see my eye doctor tomorrow.

                                                About 45 minutes after I got vaccinated I started to feel a strange sensation (a kind of tingling) in the right side of my head, inner ear,  and jaw. Then about 15 minutes later I felt the sensation in the right side of my tongue. The best way I can describe it is similar to the same sensations I feel when the Novakane is wearing off after having a cavity filled. It&#39;s Monday (4/12/21) and I can still feel it a tiny bit in my right ear, where my jaw connects (right side), and my right cheek. Hopefully, it will go away when the stiffness in my shoulder goes away.  Also, during my 15 minute waiting period I had the same tingly sensation going down my arm to my fingertips, but I was told that some people experience that sensation as the vaccine moves throughout their body. Other than that I experienced the stated side effects.

Pharmacist was asking if the patient is okay and the patient stopped responding so the pharmacist kneeled over to pick up the patients head and she looked flushed, her eyes were bulging and she began to sweat. The pharmacist asked the technician to call 911, asked the patient if she could breathe and the patient said yes but said she is not feeling well. She kneeled back over and the pharmacist was holding her hand telling her to continue breathing. The patient was very sweaty continued to breathe heavily. About two minutes passed and the patient was expressing she was feeling better and better as the pharmacist was speaking to her. The EMTs arrived 7 minutes after the call the patient had sat up already and was speaking and feeling alert.  She expressed that she felt like she was underwater and the pharmacists voice was fading during the minutes after the shot and she felt like her heart was racing. She explained that she suffers from anxiety.  The EMTs took her blood pressure when the patient was sitting and standing up, blood pressure was in normal range and also checked her blood glucose with a finger stick which was also in normal range. The patient had mentioned previously that she biked to the pharmacy. Later on the pharmacist called to check on the patient she said that she is feeling well and biked back home.

                                                With prior vaccines and flu shots, I have either had no side effects or mild.  But with the COVID vaccine, I was sicker than sick!  I wasn&#39;t expecting to miss as much work as I did, nor go to the doctor three times in a week&#39;s time.  I received it around 11:30am on Thursday, March 18.  Around 1pm, my mild headache started to intensify and had ringing in my ears that would repeatedly come and go (still is doing so today, just not as frequent).  Around 4pm is when all of the &#34;normal&#34; side effects started?chills, hot flashes, sore arm, and super sleepy.  I woke up a couple hours later, with a headache that was WAY worse and was super nauseous.   This was close to 10pm.  Then, around 11pm that same night, I developed HORRID shooting ear pains and took my first Tylenol.  The ear/jaw pain was more than I could stand - had it in both ears, but the right ear was more intense.  It felt like I had a lighting rod between both ears and had these intense &#34;zings&#34; that kept going back and forth, like they were playing ping-pong.  The painful &#34;zings&#34; reminded me of those felt during an ear infection but WAY MORE INTENSE.  My jaw was super tight, as well, with a horribly intense headache.  I spent the entire night night doing warm compresses on my ears, taking Tylenol every 4-6 hours, staying in the shower, and lots of crying.  It was so bad that I felt the need to go to the ER but didn&#39;t feel comfortable driving and didn&#39;t want to go the ambulance route?and thought it was pointless because going to the ER for ear pain would leave me there for hours and hours since I didn&#39;t feel it would be viewed an an urgent emergency.  My goal was to make it through the night and see if I could get into my PCP doctor the following morning.  I took another Tylenol around 5am, and I thankfully cried myself to sleep for a couple of hours.  When I woke up, I called my PCP but couldn&#39;t get in, so I did an online doctor visit through my insurance company.  My fever was about 103.06 at its highest during the night but was gone by 3:34pm Friday afternoon (assuming because I was taking more Tylenol than I had been post-online doctor&#39;s appointment).  Around 7pm Friday evening, I knew I needed to go to the ER or urgent care.  I got a ride and was taken to urgent care for my intense ear pain.  They gave me a Toradol injection and Tramadol prescription.  By bedtime Friday night, the injection was doing its job and made the ear pain and zings were much less intense (didn&#39;t get the prescription until a couple days later).  On March 20, Saturday night, is when I developed a red, itchy rash on my back and tummy.  Over the next couple of days, it was on my chest, arms, legs?pretty much come and was in various places.  I called my PCP Monday morning (March 22), left a message, and they called me back to tell me to restart taking my Zyrtec/HCL to see if it would help the itching.  It has and am just mildly breaking out at this time.  The stinkin&#39; ear/jaw pain returned on Tuesday the 23rd, so I loaded up on OTC ear drops and made an appointment with my PCP for Wednesday, March 24.  She saw no ear infection and essentially told me to keep taking the pain meds.  I received the vaccine on March 18 and did not return to work until the following Thursday.  In retrospect, I should have just missed the remainder of that week, too.

                                                When I first got the shot I noticed it in my throat. I told the nurses they had me wait 20 minutes before I could leave. I felt dizzy but not dizzy enough to not go home. It felt like it went to my stomach, then my head, and then I could feel it in my joints.  I drove home from the city. Two hours pass, I notice a rash but I didn&#39;t think anything of it due to indoor allergens, springtime plus it went away within an hour.   I started to get chills and fever. I had a lack of sleep due to pain throughout the first night. I was waking up feeling like my head was on fire from my ears to the top of the skull area and in front of my face by my eyes too. My eyes felt like they were going to burst. I layed in bed for 24 hours.   Day two: pain, tiredness, headache, and sensitivity to light for the next few days. Symptoms come and go for days then wean off.   Next, I had issues with anxiety, sleeping, yet being really tired as well coupled with problems sitting still. These are subsiding but still there.  I am still very tired today and a bit anxious on April 13th, 2021. I also notice my typing skills, as well as testing skills, are not as sharp as before the vaccination.

                                                March 9, 2021: 3:30am:  Woke up with chills and feeling very cold 7:00am:  Woke up with fever of up to 103F and extreme fatigue and headache which lasted during the day.  To ease the symptoms I took Tylenol every 6 hours. 10:00am:  Started noticing hives, first on my left shin and continued to manifest in my torso/back as well as forearms.  I called my physician via telehealth and I was advised to take Benadryl as needed.  Took Benadryl twice (6 hours apart) and the hives calmed down and eventually went away during the course of the day.  March 14, 2021 1.30am:  Woke up with itchy hives on my torso and back.  Took Benadryl once again.  I called my physician and was instructed to take Cetirizine for the next couple of days (10mg at 1x per day).  Symptoms subsided.  March 23, 2021 4:00am:  Woke up with itchy hives on the left side of my torso and across my back and my groin area and upper thighs.  Called my physician once again who instructed to take Cetirizine for a course of 2 weeks.  No symptoms while taking Cetirizine.  Stopped taking Cetirizine on April 2.  April 6, 2021 6:00am. Woke up with itchy red patches (with very small bumps) in localized areas of the body (ie on my hand, on my right leg, and areas near my armpits.  These lasted a little while with intense itchiness...would subside to just having red patches, and another area of the body would manifest red itchy patches.    The above lasted several days as I wanted to see if this would go away on its own.   On April 9th, called my physician to advise of the continued itchy patches which seem to come and go in different areas.  Advised to take Cetirizine once again for another 2 weeks once a day.

                                                The first two days I had a normal reaction with fatigue and soreness.  On the second night I developed a severe sinus issue that caused my tongue to turn white/gray and be dry and sore.  Frequent diarrhea, headache, sore throat, soreness, low grade fever for half a day and a resulting acid reflux condition. (I have never had acid reflux before) I was tested for Covid and Strep, both negative. Continued lymph node sensitivity for two weeks.  3.5 weeks in, I developed muscle tension, unrelenting, from the back of my head all the way down my spine. I had continued chest pressure and some numbness on my left side in my arm, leg and later my face. No home remedies worked and rarely do I get back/neck/shoulder pain. I was not doing anything strenuous. I went to the ER where they tested me for blood clots (J&amp;J news had just come out and I have a family history) and prescribed valium for the muscle tension which has somewhat helped.   I fully recognize that this might be bad luck, a series of unfortunate events after I received my shot.  However, I have not been sick all year, I have never had acid reflux issues or pain like this in my neck/back/shoulders previously.  The fact that in the 4 weeks after the shot I have not had a single day where I felt normal is a red flag to me. I feel like it is worth reporting in case anyone else has had a similar experience.

                                                About 9 pm I felt fatigue, I went to bed. I took 800 mg of ibuprofen and 1000 mg Tylenol as a pain medication. I drank a bunch of water and took an Emergen-C. I fell asleep by 10:00. I slept and I woke up - shocked awake around 04:30 am - I was super thirsty. My whole body was really sore and stiff and I had a headache.  It was uncomfortable but not unmanageable. I decided to take more Tylenol and Ibuprofen and drink more water again. I got back in bed and was feeling a lot of symptoms - I was really sore in my thigh muscles, lower back, knees and forearms. I had slight chills; I was pretty uncomfortable. I couldn&#39;t get back to sleep - I couldn&#39;t sleep on my arm with the injection site. This was about 5 pm. I never actually had a fever. But just a lot of fatigue and body aches. For the next day or two - I took 800 mg of ibuprofen and 1000 mg Tylenol every 6 hours. Within 48 hours, the body aches started to subside. I still felt a bit fatigued and I still do feel fatigued to this day. Into the next week, I started feeling like (towards the middle of the week - about the 7th) I was having an urinary urgency feeling. It was a sensation in my lower back like a UTI was coming on. I haven&#39;t gotten one in a long time ( I use to). On Friday or Saturday, when I wiped, I was seeing a slight pinkish hue  - a trace of blood - in my urine. Decided to take probiotics and Vit C. and I started to feel better. But Sunday morning, I was back to feeling pretty bad. I visited the Urgent Care on Sunday, the 11th. In the visit, they took a urine specimen. Dr. saw blood in my urine from the test. And an absence of nitrates in the urine and she said it wasn&#39;t  a typical UTI. They decided to culture the urine specimen. Macrobid - 2 times a day for 7 days - antibiotics was prescribed. I felt a little better the second day of taking it, I thought, but it was up and down. Culture showed there was no UTI.  Friday, the 16th, I had my annual visit with my PCP, I was feeling okay by this time. But I still had a sensation in my lower back - not a pain but a sensation and I still feel this sensation now (on my left side). She asked me to come back after the antibiotics to take another urine sample. Lab test. I feel some fatigue but I&#39;m doing normal daily life.

                                                As soon as I took the vaccine shot I had an immediate headache, after taking the vaccine I took Tylenol and slept in the rest of the day. The next day I woke up and my arm was red and swollen. I was running fever, still had the headache and now blurry vision. My entire body was hurting. My left side of my body felt numb and tingling. The next two days the pain became worse. I did not really have an appetite. When I did eat I could barely hold my food down. On Wednesday morning I could barely get out of bed, I also felt extreme pain in my lower legs, stabbing pain in stomach and right lower side. I also had ringing in my ears, more in the right ear. I then notice a bruise on my left leg, that it was not originally there, and was also tender to touch. I went to the emergency room on the same day and I was admitted. I was in there for 4 days, they tested my leg and stated it was not a blood clot, although it look and felt like one. They discharge me and advise me that it was a migraine that was causing all my pain.  This was on Sunday, I had a follow up with my PCP on the Friday, however to being in so much pain and shortness of breath, and arm pain I was advise to go to the ER on the Thursday and was admitted again. I was told in the ER I had a blood clot in my right arm and it was most likely from the IV from the previous visit. My blood pressure and heart rate was so high that they put me on medication. No matter the pain medication they gave me, it would not completely take the pain away. They discharge me again on Monday and after me begging them to get run any and all test, they said they found nothing. I&#39;m still in the same amount of pain and same symptoms, still having trouble keeping my food down. The only thing that changed is my left arm is not as sore, however I still have a huge knot and its still warm to touch. I don&#39;t know what else to do that is why im contacting the CDC for help. I&#39;m in a extreme amount of pain and pounding headaches.  Please help

                                                I woke up 6 hours after vaccination and started getting the chills with a fever of 101.3. I took some Tylenol which brought the fever down for a few hours but it later shot back up to 104. I had a headache, muscle pain, and fatigue. On Monday, I got a sharp pain on the side of my head causing my eyes to hurt. I called doctor who said that it sounded like a sinus infection and prescribed me Azithromycin. Days later the doctor called me and I told him that I wasn&#39;t feeling better and was referred to take a Doppler test which showed nothing wrong. I went to another doctor that prescribed me Bactrim which cleared up my sinus infection and I felt a little better. I still feel fatigued, have brain fog, and double vision. I went to a neurologist and was given a CT scan. That was two weeks ago and I never heard about the results. I&#39;m scared to drive because I don&#39;t know what will happen. The vaccine also threw off my cycle and I have gained so much weight since my vaccination.

                                                The morning after I received the vaccine, I started having chest pressure and acid reflux. There was a hard pressure in my chest and my heart was beating weird. I started to develop a headache. I had low blood pressure a couple days later. I went to the clinic and they said I may have a blood clot. I also went to Hospital and they took some blood and did an X-ray and they told me I was fine. I was told that it may be anxiety or stress. The chest pain started to go away, but now my teeth are hurting and are sensitive. I feel that the adverse event lasted for three weeks.

Talked/deep breathed my way out of fainting. Within 10 minutes all the above symptoms started to lessen. 15 minutes after receiving the injection, the near fainting experience was over and I was comfortable leaving and driving. But the 10 minutes were terrible and I came very close to passing out. My husband experienced the exact same symptoms 2 days later. I will be reporting that immediately following this submission.

I had very mild soreness of the injection site.  I had a headache the next day. I had a canker sore as well that lasted over a week.  Most of the symptoms were gone with 24 hours.  I also got diagnosed with breast cancer but I am not sure it is linked with the vaccine.

Seemed to go away for a couple days, then the right side of my head felt swollen and stuffed--but no mucous or anything. No intense shooting pain, just a constant dull ache in my inner ear that also could be felt on the right side of my face and back of my head/neck area. Lasted for close to a week. Doctor ended up prescribing antibiotics and diagnosed me with sinusitis. All symptoms went away after about 2 days of antibiotics.

                                                Had typical symptoms within 24 hrs - low grade fever (101F), body aches and arm pain.  On second day developed mild headache that went across forehead.  On 5/15/21, developed right ear pain - pressure in ear and headaches continued.  Intermittently the left ear would also have pain.  Started developing stiffness on the right side of neck that accompanied the ear pain.   Went to urgent care on 5/20/21.  Doctor said both ears were visibly full, especially the right ear.  Prescribed Azelastine nasal spray.  Called PCP in morning of 5/21/21, and was prescribed prednisone for 5 days to control inflammation.  Prednisone worked after a few days but was still run down and pain developed in my abdomen and along the right side of back/leg.  Went to ER on 5/24.21.  Doctors performed tests for blood clots.  Was told I was weak and dehydrated and given IV and pain meds. Was negative for blood clots but my IVC was dilated. Pains persisted for about 2 weeks - especially in the right abdomen.  Went to cardiologist on 6/4/21 and had a normal EKG but low BP.  Doctor believes abdominal pain is gastrointestinal and put me on proton pump inhibitor.  I am getting echocardiogram on 6/10./21 to check IVC.  Since then most pains have subsided except weak, right sided abdominal pain.  The right ear pain is back.  Starts in the morning with outer cartilage of ear getting inflamed, followed by pressure/pain in right ear, then pain in right neck.  Has been going on for a month now.  100% related to vaccine - came after vaccination and never had before.

                                                About ten minutes after leaving the vaccination site, I began feeling a strange dizziness; an internal wobbly-Jello-like sensation. I felt a pin/needle/ stabbing sensation on my left fingers, particularly on the dorsal side of the third and fourth fingers, and in the middle of the tongue. The tongue felt as if was receiving a subtle electric charge that immobilized it with every shock. It lasted about 5 minutes. My vision was blurry. After that, my mind was foggy.  At about midnight, flu-like symptoms began sudden, but they were the expected symptoms for a covid vaccine (fever, body aches, sweats, sore throat, severe headache, pain on injection site, etc.) However, the pin/needle/ stabbing sensation was felt throughout the body. It sometimes felt as if a bubble, waves, or something was moving inside of me, in different areas of the body (rib cage, legs, chest, arms, legs, face, and top of the head (like when a baby moves inside of a pregnant woman, without the visible bump). My body, head, and neck felt stiff.  Symptoms were milder after 48 hours, on and off, until 4/13/2021 when I felt a sunken feeling, like something dropped inside of me (sugar, blood pressure, blood rush, I do not know). The tense feeling of the body returned. I felt dizzy. Left arm and leg felt tingly. There were palpitations, but I think that it was due to being scared about all the other symptoms. I felt cold and was shivering. The head felt stiff again. I was very thirsty. In the following days, symptoms got milder. On 4/22/2021, at about 4pm, the sunken feeling returned, along with the dizziness, wave or bubble-like sensation through head, face, body. The wave-like sensation flashed across my face, head, and neck intermittently. It was hard to speak, pronounce words, and swallow. The tongue felt numb. It lasted about two hours. I felt exhausted, so I took a nap until 8pm. When I woke up, I felt like nothing had happened, no symptoms until 1:00 am.  At 1:00 pm, 4/23/2021, the sunken feeling, dizziness, palpitations, heavy breathing without shortness of breath, cold/shiver, blurred vision, the wave-like sensation, and pokes suddenly returned. The waves were more intense and felt like pressure on the right side of the head and left side of the chest. Went to the Emergency Room. With every wave of sensations, was accompanied by an urgency to urinate. I urinated like 3 times in a span of 30 to 45 minutes (full bladder). Findings were normal but symptoms continued through 4/24/2021, on and off. Each episode lasts anywhere from 1 to 4 hours.  Short lasting, mild symptoms returned Monday 04/26/2021, at night, until Wednesday 04/27. However, that Wednesday night, I felt a belt like, tight sensation around the left bicep and neck. It felt as if I was being grabbed by the left arm.  On 4/29/2021, around 5:00 pm, I called an ambulance because all symptoms had returned ?full force?, such as sunken feeling, blurred vision, dizziness (like passing out), intense head and left chest pressure (in waves, like having a huge fish or parasite inside the chest and head), numb mouth (like dental anesthesia), hard to speak (hard time sending the message from brain to mouth). It took great effort to speak and felt that I had to decide whether continue speaking or staying conscious. I also had blurred vision with the first sunken feeling. Symptoms continued 2 to 3 times a day. Since 4/29 a feeling of being inside of an elevator, airplane, or earthquake, and the numbness on the left side of chest and arm remain, even when no other symptoms are present. Also, both arms become numb while sleeping, every night, multiple times a night, since 4/29. Since then, I sleep on 3 pillows (two in my head, one on the shoulders to create an angle) to minimize the numbness of the arms and the head/neck pressure while sleeping.   On 5/5/21, symptoms began while car riding as a passenger and upper body felt tight. Strangely, symptoms ended when car stopped moving. Later that day, while walking through a department store, nostrils felt uneven, as if the left nostil were breathing cold air while the right was taking warm air. That night, symptoms intensified (the attack). Like all other times, urinating was too frequent while ?the attack? is present. This time, my body felt sore and tired (Flu-like). There was an intense pressure on the right side of the eye and forehead. The neck stiffness was intense.  For the past two weeks, ?attacks? have been less frequent, about 2 to 3 times a week, lasting a maximum of 2 hours. The numbness on the left side of the chest and arm continues. The feeling of something moving or pins/needles may appear sporadically throughout the day. At times, they feel like twitches. The woozy feeling of being inside of an elevator remains. Breathing still feels heavy, like trying to breathe with the face in front of a fan.  All test results from the 2 ER visits were normal, including the CT scan. A brain MRI, done on 5/5, was also normal. A 24-hour heart monitor also had normal results.

                                                My arm was in terrible pain. I could not move my arm at all. I was experiencing excruciating pain. My face, tongue and arm were numb.   I went to a doctor and they suggested a neurologist. I was told by my regular doctor that I was deficient in iron &amp; vitamin D. I took multiple tests. They said there was no nerve damage, but that the vaccine was making its way through me.   But both my arms and both sides of my face feel like its on fire. The pain does come and go. It shows up in random moments.

Told the nurses they took me back in a room took my vitals at that time I started to feel weak like my arms and legs were Jell-O or jelly. I also felt jittery the nurses gave me apple juice and crackers they put me in a private room they check my vitals again my heart rate was elevated and my blood pressure also went up . 02 That?s normalsats normal My feet are they just started to feel numb as well. A doctor came in and checked me out they felt like my exam was normal but they also felt like I might be having a mild reaction around 1500 I started to get itchy but no hives noted I took a Benadryl 25 mg at 1500 around 1515 my feet were still numb but I definitely felt better still kind of felt like my arms and legs were weak but not as bad so after an hour and a half I was allowed to leave and was told to rest for the rest The day and you call or go to the emergency room if I had trouble some side-effects about four hours after the shot  my lips did start tingling at home I did check my oxygen saturations and it was normal I look at my lips to make sure that they weren?t swelling the only thing I noticed was that a scar I have on my lip that usually you can?t see was more prominent and you could actually see it my lower back hurts a lot

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Approx 7 p.m.,  I noticed moderate pain in my lower back, hips, and legs. Around 7 30, I felt very cold and began covering up with several blankets and turning up the heat. Husband and kids reported the house was not cold at all. Within 15 minutes, chills began and increased quickly to an almost violent state. I was shivering so badly, it became painful and scary. My husband added three blankets on top of our down comforter and sent me to bed. It took approx 15 minutes to warm up, stop shivering, and slow teeth chattering enough to relax and fall asleep. Awoke around 1:30am feeling incredibly thirsty and in desperate need of water. Upon standing, the pain in my body was excruciating which made it extremely difficult to walk. Finally in the kitchen, I took Ibuprofen 800mg and filled a large bottle with water. I began to feel incredibly dizzy and needed help from my husband to get to the couch. It took approximately 2 hours before I began to feel any relief from the ibuprofen. Around 6:30 a.m., about 60 to 65% of the pain had abated and I had finished around 100oz of water. The remainder of the day was spent feeling extreme fatigue and a general sense of unwell. Appetite was poor throughout entire event. This all continued into the evening until bedtime at 11pm. Experienced moderate insomnia overnight, falling asleep around 2:30am. Could not fall asleep due to constantly thinking about the stress of the previous 24&#43; hours. Upon waking this morning, I feel almost back up to 100%.

                                                about eight hours after receiving the injection, I started to feel strong aching in my muscles and joints (most strongly felt in neck, hands, jaw, inner ear, but also including legs and feet).  I also felt chills.  My temperature was 98.8 F.  Over the course of the next three or four hours, I have felt strong sensations of aching and throbbing in my chest, back, hands, inner ears, and neck.  I also felt pins and needles all over but most strongly in chest, back, hands, inner ears, and sides of my neck.

For the first 24 hours after receiving vaccine I sweated and had severe muscle cramps which have now resolved. The ringing ear and hearing loss hasn&#39;t stopped and is very concerning.

                                                Patient received her vaccine at 11:30 AM.  Immediately after receiving the Jansen vaccine, the patient reported feeling lightheaded as she stood up.  She sat in our waiting area for about 10 minutes, and reported that she felt as though her tongue was swelling.  We contacted EMS at this point, and provided a dose of Benadryl to the patient at her request.  We brought the patient into our vaccine room where she began to break out into hives.  She vomited several times.  EMS arrived shortly thereafter and checked to see if the patient was experiencing an allergic reaction.  EMS took the patient to the hospital.  At about 2 PM, the patient called the pharmacy to let us know that she was okay.  She said that it was confirmed as an allergic reaction at the hospital.  She indicated that she had received a steroid injection at the hospital and was feeling much better.  We encouraged the patient to call us at any time if she had any further problems or questions.

                                                Fevers and shaking chills, nausea, and some dizziness  started about 7 hours after the vaccine.  I lost hearing in my left ear at about the same time.  The hearing came back a few hours later but was muffled and echoed in the left ear for about 48 hours following the vaccine.  I tried decongestant medications and tylenol without improvement in the hearing issue.  The left ear has mostly resolved at this time but the ear is popping at times with muffled hearing intermittently.   All other symptoms are resolved.

It sounded like woody woodpecker when my teeth were chattering against my mouth guard. Then the fever came in. 17 hours after the vaccine, my fever is still at 101.  Did not sleep much. Woke up with severe headache and muscle pain. Drank a gallon of water yesterday and 32 oz in the middle of the night. Despite that, I?m still thirsty.

                                                About 3 hours after the vaccine was given, I had chest pains and started running a fever. I had acute lower back pain and felt overall very lethargic. The fever continued  through the night and broke around 3am.  The next morning I felt okay but by 10am started to run a fever again for the remainder of the day and chest pains and headache/body aches were now VERY present.  It is now 5 days after the shot and I?m just starting to feel like myself again. The headaches and overall body aches lasted for days.  I also had blurry vision on and off during this time.  My husband and I workout every day and eat very well.  We?re not overweight and don?t smoke. The injection site is still sore 5 days later.   I will complete another form for my husband but he experienced the EXACT SAME reactions....every one of them.

                                                I had a very bad case of Covid in January 2021 and have not regained my taste or smell.  I was in bed for 2 weeks and had a prolonged fever up to 105 degrees--so high that I had visual and auditory hallucinations.  I had hair loss in the following months and I also continue to be fatigued.    I received the vaccination on 4/6/21 around 11am; a slight headache and face flushing occurred about 30 minutes after shot, but generally felt ok.  Woke up at 4am on 4/7/21 with chills, extreme joint pain, body aches, migraine headache, and a fever of 101.5 degrees.  Took Tylenol around 6am and went back to bed.  The migraine headache, chills, body aches, and extreme joint pain continued.  I was dizzy and extremely fatigued.  Woke up around 9 am and fever was at 102.7 degrees.  Joint pain and headache were almost unbearable at this point and I took a hydrocodone.  Took temperature around 12 pm and it was 103.5 degrees.  Fever continued rising to 104.4 degrees at 2:30 pm.  Took another Tylenol and went to sleep.  The next day, my fever had fallen back down to 102.5 degrees.  I continued with Tylenol to control me fever to around 101 degrees.   My fever persisted for 3 days.  I still have extreme fatigue, joint pain, burning scalp (which will likely mean more hair loss), zero appetite and weight loss, dizziness, blurred vision, etc.  The side effects are exactly how i felt when I got Covid in January.

                                                Thursday 04/08/21 - 1:35 PM Went to Fairgrounds to get the Johnson &amp; Johnson - Janssen COVID-19 vaccine shot with my husband. Both of us wore our masks, walked in together, went through the line together, we both got the shot in our left arms and then set together and waited the 15 minutes before we could leave. A little later at home we were working on some landscape lighting and I felt a bit foggy, light headed and kind of out of it. I was drilling into masonry and the first hole went fine but the second one for some reason just wasn?t going and I touched the drill bit with my fingertip on my left hand to see if it had smoothed out and I knew in my head not to do it and that it should be hot as heck but I didn?t feel anything at all so later that evening when I took a shower my finger was burning and I knew I had burnt it. That evening I begin to feel crippling cold, my fingernail and toenail beds had turned purple and I was shivering violently. I got under a pile of blankets with my dog and  tried to slow my breathing I could feel my heart beating in my chest and it felt like the air I was breathing was cold and frosty. I had a 104&#43; fever that night. My husband got me some aspirin a cold washcloth for my head a popsicle and water to help bring down the fever. And I was able to sleep on and off that night. When I woke up I had a 103&#43; fever and a tingling and numbness in my arms. Before the fever my arms felt tight and cold and I had a tingle that ran from my elbows to my fingertips. Again it was aspirin cold washcloth and lots of water to drink to try and get my fever down.   Friday 04/09/21 Was spent in bed trying to drink water and sleep through it. My arm was sore, not at the injection site but the whole top part of my arm felt like I had been hit by a truck. I had a fever again that evening.   Saturday 04/10/21 I thankfully woke up fever free but my arms were tingling. I had to take my husband to the airport that morning at 6:30 AM. I came back home and went back to bed until about nine when I woke up my arms were cold and sore and tingling it seemed to be getting worse in my left arm and I felt shots of electricity from my elbow down to my fingertips. At one point I took a picture because my left arm hurt so much more than the right and my fingertip beds were purple on my left and pink on my right. I took aspirin and took a nap. I couldn?t hold my phone with both hands hands like normal sitting in bed because my left hand goes cold and achy. Woke up worried that both my arms were aching and tingling from my elbows to my fingertips seems to be where it stays the most. Then that pain subsided and my lip started to tingle. After a few hours that stopped but the tingling in my arms is about constant not as strong sometimes, not in both arms sometimes, it seems to almost always be in my left arm and at one point scary enough that I almost went to the ER. Went to bed around 11:30 PM and the tips of the toes on my left side were tingling and it went to the whole leg.  Sunday 04/12/21 I woke up with a coughing fit  and mucus at around 1:00AM and my right leg with a little tingly at 4:24 AM awake again and coughing woke me had to get a drink and my stomach was buzzing and stopped now just back to the bottom half of my left leg. All of a sudden after a coughing and sneezing fit I got a tremendously sore burning throat out of no where that only lasted about five minutes. I noticed my left arm straining to hold up the pizza box tonight when my right arm had no trouble at all. Then a little later in the day stiffness in the back of my neck. It is a weird strong dry cough and I was scared to go to the ER because my symptoms were so varied and ever-changing I didn?t know what they would do with me and I didn?t want to just get stuck in there for days with him not knowing or making it worse. I told my husband ? It?s so random I?m a little scared no one is going to know what to do with me...?I?ve had issues with allergic reactions and no one being able to diagnose them and me having to figure it out on my own on the Internet that I had Thyroid problems and that I was allergic to the sun for a few years in the past and aloe vera... I didn?t wanna wind up going, them not fixing anything and having a huge bill to pay. But this whole time my body is buzzing and tingling and going through something strange. At this point I am just telling my family I?m okay and what random symptoms I have had since we spoke last. They are on standby to watch my children if I need to go to the ER. The constant buzzing, numbness, cold tingling in my arms is worrisome.   Monday 04/12/21 I am use to the numbness and tingling being a constant thing on some part of my body... There are times when I feel fine but I know it won?t last long. We can add an upset stomach and diarrhea to the list. I had a metal taste in my mouth for a little bit today. Both arms legs and my lips have randomly buzzed, ached or tingled. The websites say call 911 for emergency or call your local medical provider for assistance so I called the local ER to see if they could tell me if my symptoms were normal or if it?s something I should come in for and they couldn?t give me any advice... I was told if you feel like you should come in then come in. I had a very strong sharp pain at my elbow of my right arm tonight that made me sit up in bed...   Tuesday 4/13/21 My left arm is still sore if people touch me or if I try to sleep on my side like I normally do it hurts trying to hold my phone with both hands my arm still goes cold and achy. So far this morning my arms are both tingling and my left leg and my lips so at this point I just say I?m buzzy. 11:25 AM randomly my right arm decided to feel worse for a change but is back to a low buzz... after a few minutes. I find myself holding them up or lifting them when they hurt it seems to help a little to elevate my arms to my chest. I am just waiting to see what comes out in the media, or to see if this gets any better, or if they learn what to do about it... It isnt over, it hasnt stopped yet.

After 1&#43; hour felt mostly better so left .   30 minutes into my drive home felt sudden onset of nausea, left fingers tingling &amp; numbing with save wave of extreme dizziness. Pulled onto median and called 911. My face started stiffening into a pucker like position and my muscles all through my body stiffened, but weakened with sharp tingling. I couldn&#39;t stand so they carried me out of car and took me to Hospital.   The rooms were full so I  was in wheelchair waiting for room, shaking profusely, blue fingers, nauseous, dizzy and couldn&#39;t stand on my own. I was able to go to restroom w/assistance but My muscles were stiffened for 1 hour&#43; and over and i felt awful. over the course of 5 hours I gained strength back and started to feel better with just mild headache and nausea.   They did EKG, blood panel and chest xray which looked ok. Diagnoses as allergic reaction and told me to come back if more issues.   The day after shot and every day since have had a headache at base of neck and pressure in cheek/forehead &#43; nauseau &#43; dizziness and extreme tired. Today is 14th and no headache today.

                                                started getting a strange throbbing head pain under my right eye. then a few days later excruciating pain in my lower tooth radiating throughout my entire mouth and jaw. on the right side. it was the worst pain in my life. unrelenting, throbbing, radiating pain. I almost went to the emergency room since the pain continued for 48 hours without relief. I googled symptoms and found trigeminal neuralgia but ended up at a dental office and required an emergency tooth extraction in tooth #30. I had a root canal there prior so at first I didn&#39;t connect the two but the pathology found that I had periapical granuloma, which is inflammation. I do not know if the vaccine caused the inflammation but I believe the vaccine hastened inflammation rapidly in that area. the dental surgeon nor dentist believe there is a connection, but interestingly my mom had a similar experience right after her vaccine. I noticed there is a study testing on &#34;Oral side effects of COVID-19 vaccine&#34; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33483637/

                                                I had severe headaches and very sharp sight on the first day. The next day I experienced a strange leg numbness in the middle of the night. A week later as I was traveling I had a very bad allergic reaction that required me to call 911, as the throat swallowed. I am still experiencing leg pain when I walk. Sometimes the face feels tight also and I?m not sure this is something from the vaccine.

                                                A few minutes after the vaccine I had a lot of heat and pain in my  left ear. My left ear is still painful after four weeks. I am scheduled to see an ENT doctor today. I had to go to the emergency room because I was throwing up starting two hours after the vaccine and I was in pain all over my body. I became extremely fatigued, and I could not stop throwing up. I was given Reglan, to stop the vomiting, and I am still taking it twice daily after four weeks. I was also given Benadryl which seemed to help. I tried to stop taking the nausea medicine after three weeks and the vomiting returned. I threw up eight times that day. I still have aches in my legs and ear pain every day after four weeks. My fatigue has improved a little.

Seven days after the vaccine I began having dizzy spells, extreme fatigue and nausea, blurred vision, extreme right head pressure, floaty sensation, numbness and tingling in my right arm and leg, muscle spasms, and extreme anxiety. All things I have never experienced before. And they have persisted daily since they began. My first period one week after the injection was a couple days late and very light and only lasted a few days, which is also not normal roe me. I have short periods of relief and then the symptoms return. It is very scary and I need help. I have been to my pcp several times and the Er. They can?t explain my symptoms.

No fever yet.  8:30pm: Chills so bad I was convulsing and could barely hold anything in my hands.  Got in bed and stayed there.  9:30pm: 102.6 fever  Evening and in the middle of the night: Drank lots of water and coconut water.  Took 2 Tylenol before bed.   April 13/Day 2 -  Morning - took 2 more Tylenol Had fever all day, around 101.8 and going down to 101.3.  Slept all morning.  12:30pm - Got out of bed to try to eat chicken soup and crackers - took 3 bites and felt nauseated, like I would throw up so I got back in bed and went back to sleep.  5pm - Woke up and ate a little dinner.    April 14/Day 3 - Temperature dropped to normal.   April 15 - present:  Didn&#39;t have fever but continued to feel sick and have symptoms:  Day 3-5:  Hard to focus at work.  Someone would call me to talk about something.  Then we started talking about other things and I couldn&#39;t remember why they called in the first place - what was the topic we were talking about.  Felt very tired and had to rest periodically throughout the day, in between work meetings.    Day 6-12: Continued to feel tired and weak.  Have to take at least 1 nap to get through the day.  Brain fog - memory not as good.  Felt sick, like I had a cold (eyes hot and itchy, throat periodically hurt. I don&#39;t normally have allergies.)  Took lots of echinacea, elderberry syrup and Vitamin C.   Day 12 - Present:  Still feel tired all day long except for the first 4 hours after I have coffee in the morning.  Need to take a nap most days.  I don&#39;t feel as healthy as I did prior to taking the shot on April 12.

My body felt like it was on fire. Stomach ache, severe headache.  This pain lasted around 14 hours. After that, the joint/muscle pain lingered for about 3 days. The headache for about 3 days.  I felt and still feel weak, and have a fuzzy head.  My sense of smell and taste still hasn?t fully recovered. I feel fatigue from Covid-19 since I had it in December and this vaccine seemed to make me feel worse all over again.

                                                I received the shot Saturday at 1pm. The next day, late-afternoon Sunday, I experienced the expected flu-like symptoms: low fever (99.4 degrees F.), fatigue, aches, slight arm pain on left side, and fatigue. Monday morning (5/10) I woke up in a sweat; my fever had broken. But I had a slight headache and tinnitus. This headache and tinnitus has continued to the present day (5/17). Both have lessened in severity, and they were never crippling (I could still work and go about my business) but the constant, low-level pain is annoying. I also experience bouts of lightheadedness. Before the vaccine I had never had headaches or tinnitus.

                                                Injection site immediately, pain and swelling. Starting the next day with onset of rapid symptoms including severe headache, extreme  full body muscle aches and chills that felt painful as if had the flu, no fever,  then the extreme tiredness hit where i had to lay down and sleep.  I had to have my mom come get my young son because i couldn&#39;t even stay awake.  muscle twitching in my calf muscles and my right thumb pad, post nasal drip started then stuffiness and that smell you smell when you are sick. So i slept hard for about 5 hours and when i got up i felt 80% better. The headache had been so bad when i opened my eyes it was very painful. My arm still is very tender and sore and swollen, but these symptoms were weirdly short lived. The most scary was the sleepiness that i couldn&#39;t control.

Thought it would get better did not.  Went to Hospital Emergency Room on May 22, 2021.    D-dimer was elevated.  Dr was concerned about blood clots.  The hospital did a CT Scan of my chest with dye.  Did not find any evidence of clots.  I was released and told this could be a side effect of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination.  I was told to monitor if it doesn&#39;t go away or get worse follow-up on further investigation.  Was also told to report this side effect.  I still have the heaviness and pressure in my chest as well as a bit of breathing problems.

Went to doctor and got a ct scan and mri but couldn?t find anything. Even got three injections on left nerve on head and the pain did not dissipate. Pain medication only dulls pain once in awhile. Most of the time pain medication has not effect. I?ve had this pain for months and it?s not a coincidence that it started after getting the vaccine.

Parked the car. Car was in park but still running. Attendant at the clinic instructed me to move my car forward. I put the car in Drive and as I moved forward I lost consciousness. Completely blacked out. Unconscious in the car, the car carried on moving forward and crashed in parked car. I came to once someone tried to wake me up. Presently have no smell and have been very tired with the chills. I was sweating in my sleep, shivering and woke up in a wet bed from all my sweat. The next day I am just weak.

After 30 minutes I felt okay to leave the pharmacy.  Felt lightheaded the rest of the day and really out of it. Developed a fever later that evening that ran throughout the night.  Loss of appetite for 3-4 days.  Diarrhea on day 4.  Pain in arm at injection site for 4 days.

                                                On Wednesday April 7  started to feel like she was getting a cold. Because her husband tested positive for Covid  April 6 and her daughter&#39;s were showing symptoms, she and her daughters were tested. All of their tests were positive. So her first positive test was April  7th  which was a PCR but was taking long to come back so she got a rapid test on April 9th and that was positive as well. She had cold like symptoms, a low grade fever that never went above 100.0 and cough for about 5 days.  She felt tightness in her chest but no shortness of breath and her pulse ox was 98-99. She took Tylenol every 6 hours as needed.  The cough and fever resolved after about 4 days but the nasal congestion is severe and very uncomfortable.  She also has a burning sensation of nose and no taste or smell. She is also very fatigued but able to maintain ADL&#39;s and care for her family.

That went into pressure in my head, my tongue got numb and started to swell, started coughing up blood. I took prednisone and used my epipen. When I got home I was terrified to go to the hospital. The oral swelling subsided. The head pressure lasted at least 12 hours. My bp was real low (70/45). It did slowly come back up. Cough and chest congestion is still present. Brain fog. Fever lasted about 4 days.  This is the second report I?m putting in. I did not hear back on the last one submitted 4/8

                                                Within 4 hours I experience chills, fatigue and a headache.  Within 8 hours I had a fever and slept for the next 24 hours.  I broke out in buckets of night sweats.  The following 2 days I was generally fatigued and had sniffles.  After that I was fine, until Monday night (Day 10). I suddenly experienced a sudden onset of a painful and raised red rash at the base of my spine on my lower back. Within hours it migrated up to my head, face and then to the front of my torso. My eyes and throat closed. I took benadryl with no relief.  I called Dr. on Demand and they urged me if the symptoms got worse to head to urgent care/ER.  The next day (Tuesday 4.13) I went to the ER where they gave me a steroid shot, and prescribed me predisone and Prilosec to block the histimines.  I am still having rash symptoms,itchiness and burning.  While I have a history of seasonal allergies they&#39;ve always been stuffy nose at the most. We had no new dietary introductions or new habits.

                                                Patient reports: &#34;I received my covid 19 vaccine on Friday April 9th (J&amp;J) and need to report my reactions afterward. Had the usual immediate arm pain after injection along with nausea. Took a Benadryl and napped when got home and woke up 6 hours after injection with a tingling and swollen lower lip and constricted breathing. Took 3 Benadryl in fear of going to hospital and waited it out. Once lip went back to normal as well as breathing went to bed since it was late and slept all day Saturday. Woke up Sunday in agony from lower back pain and tailbone. Now, thurs 4/15 still in extreme pain in my tailbone. Went twice to chiropractor to help and nothing is alleviating the pain and have been practically bed ridden since Sunday. Can?t work, can?t sit, can?t walk can?t stand can?t anything without extreme pain. Been taking ibuprofen everyday and not helping.&#34;   She had a visit with us on 4/15/2021: &#34;Patient here for extreme pain on her tailbone. She had the Johnson and Johnson vaccine about 6 days ago and about 6 hours later she woke up with a tingling and swollen lip, constricted breathing, and dizziness. She wanted to avoid the hospital, so she took benadryl 75 mg and it slowly resolved her symptoms. These symptoms have not returned since. She was finally able to fall asleep that night and then slept all day the next day. The following day she woke up and experienced extreme pain in her lower back and tailbone. She saw her chiropractor twice this past week, which helped to resolve her low back pain. Per patient her chiropractor noted that her back seemed very inflamed. However, she is still having extreme pain with her tailbone and is unable to sit, stand, bend or work for more than 20 minutes without extreme pain. The only thing that seems to improve her pain is laying on her back with several pillows tucked behind and all around her. However, she is only able to stay in this position for a period of time before her body becomes stiff from immobility. She has been taking ibuprofen 600 mg TID, flexeril PRN, icing and applying moist heat to her back, but none of these measures seem to improve her pain. Lastly she has noticed that when she sits/stands for too long, her buttocks start to spasm. Denies fever, chills, n/v, numbness, tingling, incontinence or loss of bowel/bladder function.&#34;

                                                I developed Covid after my J&amp;J vaccine. I experienced cough all night, felt cold, runny nose and stuffy nose, congestion, felt low energy, and felt very tired. Then after two days later after my cold,  I lost my sense of taste and smell.  My symptoms lasted four-six days. I went to the doctor I got tested for Covid and was positive and within a week my symptoms started to go away.    I have no symptoms today.

The patient&#39;s weight was 245 pounds, and height was 70 inches. The patient&#39;s past medical history included stroke, and concurrent conditions included chronic bronchitis, anxiety, emphysema, dizziness, unspecified lung disorder and handicapped (uses a walker) due to a stroke, the patient had history of abandonment disorder. Patient was on oxygen (since last year) due to lung problems.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 041A21A, and expiry: Unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 19-MAY-2021 14:00 for prophylactic vaccination on right arm. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 20-MAY-2021 at 1:30, patient had very intense cold chills from hell and unable to focus. The next day the patient&#39;s sister had to help patient to stay upright in bed because patient kept falling over in bed and could not stay upright. The patient&#39;s sister was concerned and insisted that the patient go to the hospital to seek medical care but the patient refused. Patient then experienced periods of loss of consciousness and patient&#39;s sister was having a hard time waking patient up and then checked oxygen saturation and noted that it was low at 72%. The patient&#39;s sister subsequently managed to wake patient up and turned up patient&#39;s oxygen tank from a previous setting of 2 to a higher setting of 3. At this point the patient&#39;s sister managed to help patient sit up. The patient has been confused and dizzy and oxygen kept dropping and it will go back up then go back down. The patient then stated it was not as bad as it was, more like it was a side effect. The patient called doctor on 20-MAY-2021 at 19:30 and told what had happened and what was going on. The patient&#39;s doctor told patient she had hypoxemia and gave instructions to keep oxygen on and to see if patient was feeling better.

Patient had oxygen currently in the low 80s to 96 depending on the lungs. Patient started to fall and lean over. Patient&#39;s sister had a hard time waking up patient.

Patient was short of breath and it was twice as worse as it was. Patient also mentioned that eyelid on left eye went down. Patient could not seem to return to normal and had written notes so that could keep on track and that patient had become very forgetful and that patient&#39;s sister had moved in to help after patient received the vaccine since patient was weak. Patient stated that had severe muscle cramps in feet, toes, arms and that hands clench up like a fist for a minute due to the pain. The clenching relieved the pain but as patient unclenches the pain started again. Patient stated that was in pain and hurting, had focus fog. The HCP had told patient of side effects and that symptoms would last for about 24 hours but patient had been experiencing them for a few days. Patient was worried and fever kept coming and going. Patient took meclizine for dizziness, as since patient received the vaccine, the dizziness was much worse.  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable.

                                                First felt light headed, then my tongue, throat, and neck felt sore within approximately one hour of injection. Then my eyes started itching and it was more difficult to breathe through my nose. Things looked funny/off and I felt off; heavy/like lead and fuzzy and spacey at the same time. My vision was blurry when I tried to look at objects up close - like my phone. I had to blink several times and hold the object further away to see it. By dinner time, around 5:30, I noticed raised bumps on the sides and back of my tongue. To my knowledge, they were not there prior to the injection, but I don?t usually inspect my tongue. I did so around dinner because of how sore, puffy, swollen, and big my tongue felt. It looked splotchy in shades of white and yellow. My throat also felt puffy and swollen. At 3:50 am I woke up and my left eye was puffy and difficult to see out of. I was cold, clammy, and sweating. I had a really bad headache and felt nauseous. I took 2 ibuprofen and went back to bed. Around 7:30 or 8:00 am I got up and moved around. My left eye was no longer puffy and I could open it, but my eyes, nose, and throat were itching so badly that I wanted to scratch at them. My tongue, throat, and respiratory system felt puffy and swollen. I noticed it took much more effort to breathe. I got some water and took a Benadryl. I layed down and put  my feet up. I covered up because I was cold. I fell asleep. A few hours later I woke up and could breathe easier. The itching was less intense and my tongue, throat, and respiratory system felt less swollen and more normal.

The second day these symptoms had stopped.

I said I wanted to give her benadryl and patient refused. Sat with patient and she reported no changes, just felt different and tingled a little. Patient stated that it did not feel like allergic reactions she has had in the past. Checked tongue and lips for swelling, no sign of anything like that or other signs of anaphylaxis. By the end of allotted 30 min waiting period, patient said she felt normal again. She stayed in the store for another 30 minutes and reported back that she was fine.

This lasted for about a day. 48 hours after the vaccine my eye sight became blurry, my ears began ringing and my face became tingly around mouth and cheeks. The tingling is intermittent but the ear ringing and blurry vision has been fairly constant.

At the er  i received treatment for annaphylaxis once and about a half hour to forty minutes before i was to be discharge i had a reoccurance of symptoms and was treated for it a second time and admitted to the hospital. This was from the March 31st clinic held at the fire department.

                                                Immediate dizziness and nausea. Became tachycardic within an hour. This is still an issue 3 weeks out. Day after vaccine I felt mild flu symptoms all day and was struck with a severe chest pain and intense nausea in the afternoon. I went to the hospital emergency room and had multiple tests run. No cause was found for the chest pain. It began in the center of my chest and moved to the right side of my back.  I have been dizzy, nauseous and extremely fatigued as well as a headache for the last three weeks. The doctor didn&#39;t know what caused the pain. He checked me for a pulmonary embolism  because my clotting factors were slightly elevated.  They have not been rechecked,  though I requested my doctor have them and my platelets rechecked. I still do not feel well. My brain is foggy, my vision gets blurry at times, and I still have the dizziness,  fatigue and nausea. I am no longer achy and I have not had another chest pain like the one I had on the 26th.

Seen at a Urgent care on 4/9/2021 diagnosed with bilat otitis media, bilat otitis externa, started on Augmentin and ciprofolxacin drops.  seen by me 4/15/2021 with ear pain, congestion, hearing loss.  exam shows bilat suppurative otitis media.  I switched her to DS Septra and have asked her to follow up with ENT if not improving.  she has never had an ear infection nor allergic reaction like this before.

She passed out and when she came to she experienced decreased vision.  She was taken to the emergency room via ambulance for tests.  She was diagnosed with a blood clot to her lungs after CT scans.  She also had aditional scans and blood work and stayed at Hospital in town (I am having trouble adding this to the shaded area in question 21).

These symptoms persisted and my doctor advised me to go to the ER for brain imaging 24 hours after the vaccine. On day 3 after the vaccine, my symptoms had diminished but not subsided and I began to have new symptoms: extreme heat and pressure starting at my right ear and spreading through my face and head. The heat has subsided but not the pressure, as I am writing this it is day 13. Tests came back normal, but weakness and pressure neurological symptoms persist.

It was a feeling of trying to see under water. My distance vision was not as effected.  It lasted a two hours and then it went away. I went to an Ophthalmologist, but it happened again two weeks later on, 4/02/2021 and my vision became blurred. This time it was blurred and almost like double vision. I was scheduled an MRI and my blood work.

                                                Tinnitus in both ears, worse in the left ear. The condition began as a periodic whooshing sound in one ear that lasted for a day or two, after which it became a constant ringing in both ears. I have not had tinnitus previously. Prior to the condition, I was not exposed to any loud sounds. I work from home at a desk in a quiet room and have done so for years.

                                                Within 5 minutes, I felt like I couldn&#39;t swallow. My tongue got so big that it filled my entire mouth; throat closed. I started choking on my own spit. My hands got really big. I couldn&#39;t talk. The pharmacist told my friend to take me to the ER. I could kind of spit out stuff. She took me to Urgent Care. They gave me an epi-pen and instantly my tongue got small.  Through an IV they gave me: Prednisone, Benadryl and fluids  - by the time the IV was done I felt 90% okay. Four about 4 or 5 days - I would get fat fingers and itching. I would still have trouble swallowing - kind of choked when I swallowed. About 5 days after the event the allergy part was gone. I had three days of an oral steroid I was suppose to take and two weeks of Zyrtec. I did have flu-like symptoms also on the night of the vaccine. I had COVID in December 2020.

I did not receive any treatment.  I took OTC Tylenol for pain and by the next morning I felt about 80% better and then a few days later I developed a cough. I was then tested for Covid and tested  positive on 04-12-2021.  My symptoms with Covid lasted about 4 days, in bed was super tired. I also lost my sense of taste which lasted two weeks. I can say I am 90% better today just feel fatigued.

                                                I woke up in the middle of the night to a throbbing headache.  I got up because continuing to lay down wasn&#39;t an option.  I took 2 Advil and sat in my living room waiting for it to kick in.  I have a history of migraines, but this was unlike any headache or migraine I&#39;ve ever had.  It felt like every vein in my head was throbbing and pulsating.  It was even pulsating and throbbing through my face and in my ears.  Every time I tried to lay back down it caused tremendous pressure in my head, so I had to sit back up.  I wound up staying up all night due to not being able to lay back down.  The headache finally subsided by morning.

                                                As of June 15, 2021 I was still experiencing head and face pressure and was not able to lay down, exercise, or go more than 6 hours without ibuprofen for the pain.  My ears would start feeling full.....almost like they were swelling inside.   I went back to see my doctor and she said she thinks I have Vasculitis caused by inflammation, most likely from my vaccine since my symtoms all started within 2 weeks of my shot.  I don&#39;t tolerate steroids, so she put me on Duexis twice a day for inflammation.

                                                Severe headaches turned into sever pressure in my head, face (specifically nose, behind my eyes, and temples.)  My ears were pulsating and I was having daily dizziness.  The pressure in my face and head was almost unbearable as nothing seemed to help make it go away.  I went to my doctor&#39;s office for the 2nd time that week.  I was feeling extremely anxious because I had been experiencing this head, face and ear pressure for days on end.  I saw a PA in my doctor&#39;s office and she had me start taking anti-histamines, a low dose decongestant, and said to continue Advil throughout the day.  I started the anti-histamines and then started taking Advil 3 times a day just to keep the head pressure at bay enough to function.  At this time I had now been sleeping almost completely propped sitting up in my bed for weeks because the pressure in my head and nose area bacame unbearable whenever I attempted to lay down.

                                                The evening of the vaccine (I guessed around 6:00 p.m.), my ears felt like they became stopped up, especially the left.  I still feel pressure.  I feel like I can?t hear quite as well as before.  I hear a high pitch sound when everything is quiet.

The rest of the day I had the normal symptoms- Pounding headache, nausea, horrible body aches (couldn?t lay down or stand to be comfortable).  That night around 11:45pm I got up to let my dog in and I started seeing small black dots- blurry vision.  I felt nauseas.  I ended up falling on the floor.  I was able to get up.  I then ended up waking up in the bathroom on the floor and had no idea how I had gotten there.  My hands were vibrating.  I called my husband from work to come help me up.  I was able to sleep and didn?t seek medical attention.  I am not sure if it was low blood pressure or what could have happened I have never experienced that before.  I did contact my doctor?s office this afternoon via (online) but haven?t had a response yet.  I have been in bed all day today.  - Body aches, nausea, pounding headache

                                                Event took place at an off-site event, in a detention facility. Pt received Janssen COVID vaccine around 4:00 pm. Pt immediately reported nausea. Nurse accompanied pt to the restroom about 2 minutes after receiving vaccine, where she gagged into the sink and spit up a little clear fluid. Pt reported feeling hot and sat down in a chair available in the restroom. Pt and nurse joined by a second nurse. Shortly after sitting down pt complained of feeling dizzy and was moved to the floor to lay down. When laying down, pt appeared flushed under her chin and complained of chest tightness. She requested to sit up to help with breathing. Called 911 and first dose of epinephrine (0.5 mL of 1mg/1mL) administered, both at 4:10 pm. Pt reported no change in chest tightness following epi, but continued to respond to questions. She said she felt tired and wanted to go to sleep. Pt continued to report difficulty breathing, and another dose of epinephrine administered at 4:15 pm. A physician at GEO arrived and administered oxygen. He listened to pt&#39;s heart and lungs and reported that there was air movement in her lungs. Pt ceased to respond coherently to questions, slurring and moaning, but did not lose consciousness. Pt started tapping her lips and, upon questioning, said they felt numb. Third dose of epinephrine administered at 4:20 pm. Nurse continued to jostle patient and ask her questions, and patient continued to respond with short, slurred answers. EMS arrived at 4:23 pm and transported patient to the hospital.

I walked down my hall and saw black dots and felt dizzy with nausea.  The next thing I knew I was on the bathroom floor and didn?t remember how I had gotten there.  It is Friday and I now am experiencing shooting pains in the side of my head.  I also have been experiencing pains in my calf muscles and some chest pains.  I am still extremely tired and having abdominal pain.  I have contacted my doctor?s office about the fainting but I am going to call Monday to get an appointment to get checked out.  I am concerned about possible blood clots.

                                                Approximately 24 hours after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, patient experienced central vision loss or &#34;white out&#34; vision as she described it. She could still see things in the periphery, but her central vision went completely blank. This lasted for four to five hours and over time her symptoms gradually improved. She still has some double vision and difficulty focusing. Of note, she saw the eye doctor last month and had her prescription updated but has not picked up her new glasses. She only wears her glasses for driving and occasionally at work. She has chronic headaches and has not had any new/different headaches than before. No weakness, but her right leg did feel heavier than normal after receiving the vaccine.

                                                Not too many adverse symptoms the day of and after vaccine... tired at times and sensitivity to light but continued to eat and helped w energy.   Also, warm left side of neck and slight red rash.  Not expecting to have leg pain in my calf 6 days later then moved to quad muscle and entire left leg felt achy.  CDC at this point said to check out any leg pain.  Pain was not severe but bothersome... had STAT ultra sound at ER on day 7, turned out negative for blood clots.  Returned to my physicians office day 8... still not feeling right with more of a rash on left side of neck and warm to the touch. Tired and slightly light headed and slight pain in left upper chest.  Digestion not the best starting day 5 thru 10.  Blood test returned normal for platelet levels but low eosinophils... either allergies or body is fighting the vaccine and creating antibodies (most likely).  No known allergies besides maybe skin reaction to Timothy Bluegrass.  Moderate headache day 9 and 10 which made me more fatigued (pain on both sides of head above ears and temples)... normally I do not get headaches.  Also, loss of appetite or feeling slight nauseous on day 8, 9, and 10 after the vaccine.   Now on day 11 and 12.. feeling better but still not quite right.  Lightheaded and feeling fullness in head but more energy than day 9 and 10 by far.  Never heard of people having symptoms after day 1 or 2 of the vaccine, so obviously I think this should be more documented for patients especially after blood clotting as a possibility 6 days after the vaccine.

Pt was lowered to the floor and placed in trendelenburg.  BP 132/71, HR 93, 98% on RA.  BP 10 minutes later with pt lying down dropped to 83/49, HR 52 and 99% on RA.  Each time we attempted to have pt sit up, Pt would begin to have tingling in extremities and ringing in ears.  EMS called.  BP eventually raised to 127/66 with pt sitting upright but EMS preferred to transport pt to Hospital. Pt evaluated in ED and notes indicate that EKG was done and revealed normal sinus rhythm. Determined to be vasovagal reaction leading to syncope. Pt discharged to home in stable condition.

I took Advil cold and sinus multiple time b/c the pain was so bad. Inhaled menthol rub to try to fine soothes. Used ice to help my throbbing head ache. It lasted all day long. My mom took care of me massaging my head. Had I known know what I know I would have gone to the ER but I didn&#39;t at the time thinking the adverse reaction time for the vaccine had subsided. 03/11/2021- felt much better but weak and my vision seemed a bit off. I had a hard time reading things close to me as it was blurry. Current- I feel fine but my close range vision is blurry

I was sweating and vomiting.  My husband carried me to the car and brought me to the ER. At the Er I was given a patch for my back pain, medicine for the dizziness and nausea. The dizziness didn&#39;t subside. I couldn&#39;t walk. I told them I had gotten the vaccine two weeks before and they said it wasn&#39;t related. I was diagnosed with a bladder infection, high blood sugar, and vertigo. I was discharged in the evening but with no improvement.  I was not able to focus or walk for days. I saw my OBGYN, he was the only doctor I could see right away and he referred me to an ENT. The ENT can&#39;t see me until the end of June.  I wasn&#39;t able to drive for weeks. I am slowly regaining my balance but still feel waves of dizziness and my eyes can&#39;t focus well when I am reading. The back pain is gone. My OBGYN also doesn&#39;t feel the dizziness is related.

                                                The day after the vaccine my left arm hurt, and I thought it was normal. After two days I was in a lot of pain and I couldn&#39;t lift my arm up. I have to lay on the other side at nights because it hurts. It is constant pain and Motrin does not help the pain. It is still painful at the end of the day after three weeks.  I went to the ER and they thought that it was nerve damage from the vaccine administration. I was given Steroids which helped a little at first but then the pain returned. It was only a three day course because I am Diabetic and it effects my blood sugar. I can raise my arm a little now but not above my head.  Three weeks after the vaccine my right ear started to ring and it was very intense and I couldn&#39;t hear for about four hours. I went to the ER and all the tests were negative. The ringing in my ears is still coming and going. It is very sensitive to sound and it is hard for me to hear. If there is any loud noise the ringing becomes very uncomfortable. It feels like I need to pop my ear all the time. I was told it might be related to the vaccine. I have never experienced anything like this before.

Also, received allergy shots in each arm since my vaccination, and both have resulted in large welt and subsequent bruising which has not occurred in the past year of having the same injections.

                                                Starting about noon the next day I was walking outside and completely passed out cold, hit head on the way down. When I came to everyone was standing around me and told me not to move. I was unconscious about 10 sec. Everything went white. An ambulance was called, it took them a while to show up, evaluated inside ambulance, everything was normal. EMT advised that they didn&#39;t think I needed to go to the ER.

                                                5/6 1pm Immediately after shot administered had a small headache but barely noticeable. 5/6 11pm Fever started with body aches.  Fever was low and then rose to ~102 for the next 24 hours. During this time for a short period of time, ~1 hr, my throat/back of my mouth went numb.  The feeling in my mouth returned.  During the fever I was dizzy but not as bad as a Vertigo feeling. (I experienced Vertigo 17 years ago - postpartum.). I also experienced slight stomach pains during this time. 5/8 starting on this day going forward for 2 weeks I experienced headaches, which came on in the evenings, just after work.  From around 4pm till 8pm I was in bed daily with headaches.   I usually do not get headaches unless................  unless it is my period times.   During this 2 weeks I also added 5 lbs of weight, which I believe is water weight.    Lately I have consistently been 125 lbs (up from 120lbs since I was a teenager) and I went to 130 lbs in 2 weeks.  I feel as I am retaining water weight.  Pain in my legs attest to the weight.   The headaches ended for a few days and returned yesterday afternoon.   I can tell my body is trying to fight this Covid-19 shot.  I am hopeful these body changes will subside, weight gain and headaches overtime.    Also, during the first 2 weeks after the shot I also experienced vision blurriness.  This has since gone away and my vision has been self corrected.  I have not gone to the doctors as I viewed all of this associated with the vaccine and normally I am a healthy 45 year old woman otherwise.  I haven&#39;t needed to see a doctor in over a year.   If these headaches and body aches/weight gain continues I will be at the doctors for help.  I figured I would give it time to enter and exit my body first.  Ibuprofen sometimes worked to lessen the headaches, but not always.  You can email me any further questions you have.  Thank you.

Initial information received on 07-JUN-2021 was processed together with additional information received via 2 telephone calls to and from the patient&#39;s husband on 11-JUN-2021. The patient&#39;s height and weight were not reported. No past medical history or concurrent conditions were reported. The patient had no family history of any blood/clotting disorders and that she did not travel anywhere prior to receiving the vaccine. The patient received COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S (suspension for injection, route of administration not reported, batch number unknown), dose not reported, administered once in total on 13-MAY-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced feeling dizzy, and had no energy for anything. On 14-MAY-2021, the patient started feeling confused, her mouth started feeling like it was drawing, and her speech started slurring. On 28-MAY-2021 she went to bed and got up and she couldn&#39;t feel her left side, with paralysis. She was also drooling and her husband took her to the hospital. The patient was flown by helicopter to another hospital. During the telephone call to the reporter, he reported that his wife&#39;s laboratory results were all within normal ranges at the second hospital, including her platelet count at 189,000 (units and normal range not reported). On 29-MAY-2021, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of her brain revealed a 12 mm blood clot in the thalamus. The patient was treated with Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and Plavix (clopidogrel bisulfate). It was reported that the clot could not be cleared before she was discharged after 4 days hospitalization on 31-MAY-2021.  As of 07-JUN-2021, the patient reported being highly agitated and could not hear out of her left ear, had no feeling or strength on her left side and was very unsteady walking. As of 11-JUN-2021, the patient&#39;s husband reported that the patient was still experiencing weakness of the left side of her body with no energy for anything (reported as being very active prior to vaccination), trouble walking, feeling dizzy sometimes, trouble hearing with her left ear, was very agitated and was frustrated that these events had happened to her. The patient was on medical leave from work at the time of reporting. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from the events.  This report was serious (life-threatening, disability or permanent damage, caused/prolonged hospitalization and other medically important condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This spontaneous report received from a patient and her husband concerned a 45-year-old woman who experienced blood clot in the thalamus 15 days after vaccine. No past medical history or concurrent conditions were reported. The patient had no family history of any blood/clotting disorders and that she did not travel anywhere prior to receiving the vaccine. On day 15, the patient went to bed and got up and she couldn&#39;t feel her left side, with paralysis. She was also drooling and her husband took her to the hospital. The patient was flown by helicopter to another hospital. During the telephone call to the reporter, he reported that his wife&#39;s laboratory results were all within normal ranges at the second hospital, including her platelet count at (189,000). On day 16, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of her brain revealed a 12 mm blood clot in the thalamus. The patient was treated with aspirin and clopidogrel. It was reported that the clot could not be cleared before she was discharged after 4 days. As of day 25, the patient reported being highly agitated and could not hear out of her left ear, had no feeling or strength on her left side and was very unsteady walking. As of day 29, the patient&#39;s husband reported that the patient was still experiencing weakness of the left side of her body with no energy for anything, trouble walking, feeling dizzy sometimes, trouble hearing with her left ear, was very agitated and was frustrated that these events had happened to her. The patient was on medical leave from work at the time of reporting. The occurrence of blood clot in the thalamus could represent background incidence of such events in the general population and the normal platelet count exclude thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. However, a relationship with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine cannot be ruled out and thus the relationship is considered indeterminate.

Fingertips still feel like electricity is running through them and fingers/hands still hurt; extremely hungry/thirsty from 03/25/2021 - 03/29/2021; fatigue, pain at base of skull under ears, tinnitus extremely loud and both ears feel like ear ache; During the night of my high fever, lower back where kidneys are started hurting very badly.  What is still left of that pain on day 5 is a pain radiating from my lower back down my right leg many times throughout the day (treating with ibuphrophen).   Pain around knees, elbows, ankles, and bottom of feet- different than joint pain.  All my POTS symptoms are in high gear (tachycardias, very low BP,  pain, dizzy, vertigo).    If the leg/lower back pain, and left arm problems continue, I will see my neurologist or immunologist.  I have reached out to both to make them aware.  My husband had the JJ shot same day, same place and had zero side affects.

                                                I was directed to my seat (if walking into the room, the first table but the 2nd seat).  The woman was learning the computer system from a gentleman, and she assured me she just didn&#39;t know the computer, but knew how to give a shot.  I pulled my arm out of my sweatshirt and pushed my short sleeve shirt up.  She did the alcohol wipe, then pinched my arm, I looked away as the shot went in.  I felt a horrible pain...not even sure how to describe it, just extreme pain and very achy and said Ow maybe 3 times (I am one that can tolerate quite a bit of pain, and I assumed it would sting, but this was different) as she was injecting me.  She apologized. The gentleman said Johnson and Johnson is a little thicker.  I said to him that I had never ever experienced this much pain with a vaccine before-never.  Again, I am talking about as it was injected. I went to sit down for the waiting area, the gentleman who was handing out cards for reviews asked me about it and I said it hurt so bad, I&#39;d never had a shot hurt that bad.  Another worker (female) overheard me and asked me if it was a burning-she had a burning with hers (think she said moderna). I said I would not necessarily say it was a burning, it was pain. As I sat there, I texted my husband and told him how bad it hurt (with the injection) and I&#39;ve never had a vaccine hurt like that.  I started to wonder if it was administered incorrectly? I looked over and the gentleman was now doing the vaccines and she was watching. My husband had Pfizer and he said that didn&#39;t hurt at all. I was feeling it up into my neck as I was sitting there. I was trying to rub my arm and neck hoping that would help as well as move my arm around. When we could leave, I asked the volunteer if she had heard of anyone else having that much pain DURING the shot.  She said she only heard of maybe one other person that said ow. I left, started to cry in the car because of the pain and experience, then spoke with my husband before I left. I came home and got some ice to put on my arm hoping that would help. I did expect pain in the arm after a shot. Within a couple of hours, I noticed pain going down my arm and into my wrist. I thought maybe I needed to be active with my arm and move it so tried that.  I started to notice more side effects of the vaccine as the evening progressed:  I had the typical side effects I figured I&#39;d have, achy, joint pain, chills, nauseous, no fever though. I was noticing pain into my neck (occasionally even into jaw), shoulder, scapula area of the back, and left side under the bottom part of my ribs.  I was feeling tightness in my chest, too, so I decided to try 2 aspirin to see if it helped with any symptoms. I did have slight dizziness, and a weird sensation in my head-like a zapping? I didn&#39;t sleep well, and had to stay completely off of my left side. Thursday, I felt better than that night, but still tired, achy, nauseous, chills, and not 100%.  My arm still was really affected...it seemed extremely fatigued as well as painful...the pain was radiating up and down and couldn&#39;t raise my arm without it hurting. Around noon I decided to take 2 aleve to see if that would help me at all. It did help with the pain and achiness, but was getting a &#34;nerve-type&#34; pain still up and down my left arm into neck/scapula area down to my wrist and hand/fingers. Still couldn&#39;t sleep on my left side. Friday, I was definitely doing better with all the other symptoms, I could abduct my arm more than 90 degrees, so I was excited about that. I did wake up with my middle/ring finger hurting (at the base of that area) and a bit numb so put my hand in and out of a fist. The pain subsided, but the numbness/tingling sensation was still there. I continued to take aleve hoping that maybe there was just inflammation around the nerve causing the issue.  Aleve did help, but it still never went away completely.  By late afternoon, I was getting concerned if I was permanently affected by this. As I was holding a bowl of food and eating, my left arm was going numb. I was even feeling it into my gluts (sciatica?). Again...all of this was after the shot and only on the side I received the shot. That evening I was able to lay on my left side, but not for long periods of time because it became uncomfortable and arm would go numb. Saturday, I still had the nerve pain and was not in a good spot.  It made me sad, angry, scared, and I didn&#39;t want to talk about it too much-just wanted my arm and all the different radiating pains I was having to be back to normal. I was feeling it up into my neck, scapula, my side(the rib area I previously mentioned), even into my gluts and down leg near ankle as well as down the arm into elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand, fingers (particularly that middle finger and thumb area).  I tried to use my arm as normally as possible thinking maybe I need to just keep it moving, but it would fatigue, especially between shoulder and neck. I tried Ibuprofen on this day.  Again, the pain relievers helped some, but didn&#39;t take it all away. Sunday I was in a horrible spot mentally and crying throughout the day because of the sensations I was feeling still: up and down the arm, shoulder, neck, scapula, side and still into ankle area. I decided I would call my doctor on Monday. Monday, I woke up and was feeling better overall, but still having the nerve sensations down my arm as well as up into shoulder, neck, scapula and my left side.  But everything was not as intense.  I spoke to my doctor who said there was a protocol, a number I needed to call.  Monday night I took ibuprofen because I started to have a horrible headache-didn&#39;t go away completely and still have this morning-not sure if it&#39;s related or just a normal headache. Still feeling tingling nerve sensations into forearm and fingers.  My shoulder/neck area feels fatigued, but so far not noticing the nerve pain yet, so that&#39;s a positive. On Monday,  it seemed to get worse as the day went on, so we will see. I definitely feel in hand/wrist/fingers as I am typing now. I know this is a lot, and I think I&#39;ve captured it.  Again, I had none of this pre-shot.  The pain during injection is what alarmed me most as I expected side effects after the shot, but not this nerve type issue.  For this to be lasting as long as it is concerns me, and the fact that it exhibits on my left side where I got the shot. I am very anxious as it hasn&#39;t gotten back to normal.

                                                I received the vaccine on March 27, 2021. Seconds after the injection was completed my vision went blurry, but it only lasted a few seconds. On March 28, 2021 I felt like my body was going to explode. My blood in the back of my head was thumping. I tried to take a nap to calm my body down but my body felt comp!eye unrest and thumping. My urine made the whole inside of the toilet water look like a white thick cloud.  I have never seen my urine look like that in my life. I used my husbands blood pressure monitor and my blood pressure was 152/104!  I arrived at urgent care about 5:30 PM. They gave me a blood pressure pill. I have never had a blood pressure pill my entire life. They also took a urine sample since I told them about the my very strange looking urine. They found protein and blood in my urine. The culture days later showed no infection. I am still having issues with the high blood pressure.

Gave patient a bottle of water and gave her a dose of Allegra 180 mg which she declined to take but agreed to keep with her. Observed patient over the next 30 minutes and during that time the patient reported a gradual improvement of symptoms.  She spoke on the phone with husband whom is a physican and he told her to drink the water and thought she was fine.  Patient declined EMS and going to the hospital across the street. Upon leaving she states that she is feeling normal and I advised her to call 911/md  if any worsening of symptoms.

                                                About a half an hour after injection my lips and tongue started tingling and swelling. Benadryl was able to control this.  An hour after the injection I started to hurt and ache, which was expected. But it soon eclipsed the achy miserable feeling one normally gets with a flu shot. The left side of my body started having fibromyalgia nerve pain that was so severe I had no option but to lay in bed and endure it. The lightest touch felt like touching raw nerve endings similar to  getting sugar into  a severely bad tooth. I experience pain on a daily basis and this was something above and beyond any fibromyalgia pain or nerve pain I have experienced in the past. It was so bad, I would not have wanted to live the rest of my life in that level of pain.  I took a Phenergan like I do for my chronic migraines and it allowed me to get some rest and thankfully in the morning it had mostly abated. I continue to have worse than normal fibromyalgia pain for 5 to 6 days after the injection.

                                                Received Janssen vaccine 4/6.  Started menstrual cycle 12 hours after vaccine even though had just completed last cycle 1 week prior.  Normally cycles are 28-30 days apart.  They have not been quite as regular since Covid and has had some shorter periods between normal cycles.  After the vaccine bleeding was heavier than normal with large clots but by end of last week had changed color and looked like it was ending.  Today had no discharge upon awakening but again has a small amount of bright blood.  Of course, there is concern for coagulopathy related to the vaccination.  No leg pain, no shortness of breath.  Has had HA off and on since had Covid but no worse now than in previous weeks.  Left ear pain has been painful since Covid but now has pain in both ears when that occurs.  Quit taking ibuprofen last week for discomfort and switched to Tylenol.

By 4 pm I had a fever of 100.7, really bad shaking chills, body aches, and nausea. My chills went away by the next day. My fever, bad headache, and ringing ears continued. My fever reached 101 but never went over. It lasted until Sunday evening. It has been 2 weeks and 1 day and my headache has never gone away, though it is manageable and mild now, although it was really bad last night. My ears/head continue to ring non-stop. Nothing helps with that.

I still have distorted hearing in my left ear and my right ear is still muffled. It happened a little under 3 weeks after the vaccine. The doctor performed a hearing test in my left ear and it showed moderate sensorineural hearing loss compared to the hearing test I had last August. 2 weeks later my right ear showed decreased hearing. I was put on 60 mg of steroids for 2 weeks and given doxycycline for 2 weeks. The dr also had me do a CT scan. I also had an elevated D-dimer test for clots.

                                                About 5 minutes after I received the shot, had a sudden burning sensation in the middle of my chest that radiated out. I thought that was it for me. Nausea, dizziness, numbness in my left cheek and arm, got a funny taste in my mouth. This got pretty intense and lasted about 10 minutes. They had me stay in observation for another 45 minutes as those symptoms came in waves but never as intense as the first time. They let me go and I went home to rest. On the way home my cheeks became flushed and it felt like my eyes and cheeks were swelling. I had a lot of other symptoms over the next several hours which I wrote down. Early Tuesday morning those symptoms went away and I was left with some flu like symptoms, dizziness and a brain fog like I have never had before.

It felt like fire in my arm at the point of the shot and moving down toward my wrist. It was cold and rainy, and I had taken my arm out of my sweater and the sleeve had gotten a little damp. I put my arm back in the sleeve and the cool damp sleeve made my arm feel better while I was observed and then drove home.  3/28 3pm I got home and the arm the shot had been given in was sore ? the aches seemed to move across my shoulders and all over my body.   3/28 10pm ? 7:30 am, Over the course of the evening, the aches seemed to get worse and I developed a headache, so, I took 2 tylenol and went to sleep.overnight I had severe chills.   3/29 7:30 am I took 2 Alkseltzer Cold &amp; Sinus (tylenol and decongestant) and laid back down. Around 9am I had a glass of juice ? I was extremely thirsty and this helped.  3/29 11:30am The headache and body aches continued, but the chills seemed to break with a trade to cold sweat. I took 2 more Alkseltzer Cold &amp; Sinus (tylenol and decongestant) and got up.  3/29 3:30pm The headache and aches continue, I took 2 aleeve to manage the headache and body aches.  3/29 6:30pm the body aches and headache are better but not gone. Cold sweats starting again 7:30 ? 2 more tylenol. 3/29 11:30 2 tylenol for bed ? slept through the night no problem.   3/30 ? 8am: Woke up still achy, but the headache is significantly reduced, started feeling a little dizzy and periodic cold sweat 3/30 ? 6:30 pm still a little dizzy and marginally achy  3/31 ? 8am: mostly back to normal. The spot on my arm is still raised and tender, but in general, I feel like I did before the vaccine, suffering seasonal allergies sinus congestion and headaches. My eyes are very tired, I?m having a hard time pulling things into focus or looking at screens ? the headache on Monday was a migraine complete with severe light sensitivity. Wearing readers with blue light blocking helps my eyes feel better.   4/1 ? arm still sore at location of shot, going to continue using scar cream on bump where shot was given. Eyes still a little weak/tired.  4/3 ? arm finally quit hurting ? still sore, but not actively in pain at site of injection.

Headache, eyes ached, mild nausea, stomach upset and diarrhea.  Could not stay awake.   Symptoms subsided greatly 30-32 hours after vaccination.  Fatigue persists, but is minor; goes away with short rest.

                                                I woke up on 4th with pins and needles in my hands and I called the doctor&#39;s office. They said that I was crazy and nothing was going on with me and call back in a week even though the receptionist at the office had just said they were getting all kinds of calls about it.. For the next week, my hands and my feet were tingling intermittently. I went to the doctor on Friday, June 11th. They did a full metabolic panel - all came back fine. The next morning, June 12th, I felt my face was numb. I called doctor and she said it was anxiety. So my hands were pins and needles. The face numbness was new. I see a naturopath and I told her and she said it was call for concern and she looked at labs and told me to call doctor back and she mentioned that she had seen all kinds of people with these symptoms. My anxiety is super high. I&#39;m not usually an anxious person. I have high blood pressure. I have joint pain in my hands - if I take Naproxen. If I take Aleve the joint pain goes away. I feel like my face is dragging but when I call in the mirror it looks fine. That&#39;s the feeling of numbness says my naturopath - and that&#39;s the same with my lips. I feel like I have some brain fog and I&#39;ve been stumbling over words. That happens about once a day. I have a doctor&#39;s appt on Friday for blood pressure. I did not have blood pressure before this. Usually my blood pressure is 126/90 (when normal) and it&#39;s tracking at 143/103 and 140/100 ever since I had the vaccine.

Because of this, I was getting nauseous and fever spikes. Then about 3:30am, I had water like diarrhea. After that, I started to feel dizzy (I was fine as long as I still) with cold chills along with being very tired.  When I got home, I took some Ibuprofen and took a nap (4 hour nap). Began to feel much better. When I woke up, I felt better but still had a stiffness in my shoulder blade area and left side neck.

My arm was so super sore I couldnt lift it over my head.  On 3/10 the headache was still there but I  felt a little better.  But the ringing in my ears has been since day one and the headaches have been off and on as well since then also and on 3/25 I couldnt take it anymore so I went to see my PCP who referred me to an Audiologist but that appointment isnt until 4/29

I didn?t think it was a big deal, but it was unusual for me to faint.  I haven?t fainted since I moved in 1985 because of altitude.  I also had moderate body aches different from my fibromyalgia or RA symptoms.  This all happened about 25 hours after I received the Johnson Johnson vaccine.  I didn?t think to report it until I read the news.  I am fine now and don?t need any help.

                                                Lips and jaw felt significantly numb and tingly, dizziness and faint feeling, approx. 30 minutes after injection. Symptoms lasted about an hour. Pharmacist had instructed me to wait 15 minutes after injection in case of a reaction, which I did. I felt fine when I left the store and got into my car, but while driving home, I began to have the symptoms described above. I pulled into a hospital ER parking lot and stayed in or near my car until the symptoms subsided. I called my GP and talked to a nurse, who said if I could breathe and swallow, I was safe to go home. I did not enter the hospital ER or seek medical treatment because the symptoms did not get worse. After returning home and waiting about another hour, facial numbness completely subsided.

                                                About 20 minutes after the injection, I had numbness in my lips and cheeks (it felt like pins and needles).  Over the next 10 minutes, I noticed swelling in my throat (swallowing felt somewhat obstructed).  These persisted for an hour or so until I took Benedryl which seemed to ease the numbness but the swollen throat persisted..

                                                Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) in left ear, beginning 8-9 days after vaccine on  March 19th Friday.   Symptoms of fullness, muffled hearing, sensitivity to sound.  This was coupled with increased/exacerbated tinnitus in both left and right ears.  Hearing test and physical exam done by ENT on March 22 Monday showed a loss of hearing in low frequencies in left ear of up to 40 DB.   Treatment with steroids was initiated (prednisone 50 mg for 7 days, 30 mg 1 day, 25 mg 1 day).   Follow-up visit to ENT on March 31 showed improvement in hearing nearly back to levels prior to the SSNHL; however tinnitus remained elevated.  Prednisone was continued at 40 mg for 1 week with taper.

During course of evening nausea, neck, shoulders and lower jaw severe ache by morning. Small sores (the little bubble kind) similiar to mild food allergy broke out on inside bottom lip only and passed only when soreness left lower jaw near late afternoon. Felt better by 5pm. Slight muscle aches in left arm, shoulders &amp; tiredness remained through following day April 2. As of today, 4/12 - I&#39;m having the heavy flow menstral cycle of a freaking teenager. Not fun. I&#39;m accustomed to a very light period at my age not the uteras ripping heavy flow of those first 20 years. Hoping this is a one time deal.

I was achy all day off and on.  Sunday 4/11 I felt okay all day until around 10 p.m. At this time I noticed my throat was sore and swollen. I started coughing and feeling achy again. If I laid down I started to wheeze. I was very tired. Monday 4/12 I slept all day until 2:00 p.m. When I got up I felt achy and my throat was sore. I had a dry cough. I could not taste or smell. 4:15 p.m. went to my Doctor and was tested for Strep and Covid 19. I tested positive for Covid 19.

It comes and goes, but is noticeable.  Given the current events it made sense to report since it is also accompanied by mild cold symptoms affecting my sinus area.   No headache or other pain currently.  Breathing is normal.

Called personal physician who recommended going to the Emergency Department. Took one 25-mg benedryl and went to ED where physician confirmed allergic reaction to the vaccine and administered 20 mg prednisone and pepcid. Symptoms improved over two-hour observation and was released. Continued 20 mg prednisone, pepcid (twice daily) and benedryl (every 6 hrs) daily for 4 days, followed by Allegra and Zyrtec once daily each until 4/13/21. Swollen throat, dry tongue, excess thirst, shakiness, weakness, ears full, headache, and increased heart rate/palpitations persist 7 days post-vaccination. Had in-person visit with primary care physician on 4/13/2021 who recommended Nasocort twice daily for two weeks for fluid behind ears and antihistamine once daily for 5 additional days, and will refer to local allergist for work-up.

I was extremely thirsty which caused me to consume over 60 ounces of water overnight.  Woke up about 7am and went to prepare coffee and blacked out.  When I woke up I was on the floor and had a bursted nose and EMT was called.  I was transported to the ER where I was administered IV fluids, EKG and CBC were done but clear and I was diagnosed as severly dehydrated.  I was released about 5hrs later but the consistant feeling of constant thirst has remained even still today.  I have also had a lingering headache also.

                                                Headache and general tiredness began 30-45 min after shot.  Muscle soreness (injection site, rib muscles, leg muscles, back muscles and neck muscles) began soon after.  By 6pm, muscles had become painful.  I had chills but no measurable fever.  I got in the bed but unable to sleep due to muscle pain and discomfort.  Hip joints and back began to ache.  Fever and chills worsened over the next several hours to measurable with highest at 102F.  I took 1000mg tylenol generic which did not lower fever but fever did not rise higher.  Throughout the night, I experienced calf muscle cramps and foot cramps, stomach pains, joint pains, inability to sleep, worsening injection site soreness and armpit soreness (likely lymph node soreness).  Once in middle of night I may have felt chest tightness but I even doubted that I really experienced it as I had been thinking about all the AEs I was experiencing.  Symptoms continued through night.  Next morning, developed a cough so I made appointment to get a COVID exposure test at 1pm on 13th April because I had flown in plane on 10th April.   Cough could have been due to allergy type post-nasal drip because of high pollen in area.  By late Tue evening, I felt better.  Headache had resolved and muscle symptoms improved.  Now (3:45pm on 15th April) I am still experiencing lymph node/armpit soreness and general inability to focus, think clearly.  I feel like I am in a fog.  I emailed a message to my physician and reported this through VAERS

                                                About 4 days after I started having abdomen pain, it was like having contractions, then bleeding and spotting, and it was a different type of color instead of a period color, more burgundy. it lasted 26 days, when I&#39;d eat it would start again, I started having headaches, and had vision problems, then SOB started and I used the inhaler to help. I also had a low grade fever of 99.8 - 100 that lasted up until about 5 days ago. I started having bruising and leg pain, the bruising would be if someone helped me get up, I have little bruising dots over my body.  I went to the ER 3/16/2021 because the stomach and headache pains, they did a MRI and Ct and said it was acute stomach pain and migraines and told me to see a OBGYN for the bleeding and gave me meds for stomach pains. Bentel for stomach and Floraset for headaches but it never worked. I had a nerve block on my head for the migraines but it didn&#39;t work.  The GYN gave me something to stop the bleeding and she&#39;s wants to do a D&amp;C. I&#39;m waiting to see my PCP on the 19th.  I still have the purple dots and headaches, I still get the contractions and the stomach issues have settled some.

Flu like symptoms without fever ie: aches, pains, skin pain, confusion. Dizziness, feeling of being extremely anxious and out of sorts in space. Had to complete round of Steroids and numbness and tingles got better, but did not dissolve. After completion of IV steroids, thirty-four (34) days later all symptoms returned full force and worsening. Checked into ER 4/10 and admitted into hospital. Have not been able to complete normal routine or work level since March 27th due to neurological disturbance and symptoms.   Two (2) Eye exams, 3/30/21 confirming swollen optic nerves.

Then about 4/6/21, a month later she started slowly loosing her vision, and got her vision back for about 2 weeks, and then she slowly started loosing it again.   She went to her primary care who told her nothing, and told her to go to the ER.  She went to two walk in clinics, the ER, an ophthalmologist, a neuro-ophthalmologist.  She has been to a retina specialists, two other neuro-ophthalmologists, and a neurologist who do not know what is wrong with her.  They tell her that her eyes look healthy and good but she cannot see.  Her left eye she may have about 5% of her vision and 15-20% in the right eye.  She was given dry eye drops by one of the earlier physicians.  She has had some follow ups, and the neurologist told her to drink water eat low carbs.  So, she is frustrated at this point that nobody knows what to do and treat her eyes and is depressed.  She lives alone and is not able to see to read her credit card info to order food or to see what she has to eat.  She was also given Xanax, which she has not taken yet.

                                                Twelve days after the vaccine I got a severe headache with blurry vision. I was also short of breath and my legs were swollen. I was dizzy and had body aches mostly on my left side. My left kidney was inflamed. The pain went all the way on the left side of my body from my ribs to my legs. My left leg was the most swollen. Many of the symptoms lasted for two and a half weeks. The headache lasted for three days. The first week was the worst. When I went to the ER  after a week they did not find any blood clots. The aches pains and swelling in my legs came and went over the course of three weeks. I was very tired when the symptoms were present.

                                                I started itching and found hives on my ankle. It started at my ankle and it moved all the way up to my head and face. My eyes became swollen. I was told to take Benedryl by my doctor. It took three days to clear. It returned a week later. I followed the previous request and took more Benedryl. It cleared and returned again last week. I called the CDC and they informed me that the hives may come and go.

The swelling varies in the upper and lower lip and the tissues above and below the lips.  The swelling will last a day or two.  Eye swelling also occured on 5/27.  I take Benedryl to decrease the symptoms.  I have not had lip injections, and have never had this swelling prior to the vaccine.  It does not seem to be related to any food allergy.    I have photos of the occurrences.

I waited 30 minutes and everything went good. The next day I felt some kind of sore in my  upper arm, and then I was fine, but later, around 10 days after the shot, I felt very very sleepy for 2 days, and my arm started to sore again and still does, mostly when I move it to the back or when I lift something

She tired to go to work, her husband said that she did not look good.  She was sent home from work, she went to the nurses station at work, had a fever of 100.2 who told her to go home, it was a reaction from the vaccine, and to call us.

Arm was sore but no more than any other vaccine. close to 4 hours later, headache started, felt hot and cold. Hard to sleep, sweating a lot during the night. Headache was so bad it felt like a combination of a bad flu with a hangover. felt very thirty. In the morning I was dizzy, hot, cold, temp 99.8, sick to my stomach, coudn&#39;t taste food very well, just like when you have the flu, nothing taste good. I spend the following day in and out of sleep, very tired, hard to focus. The sensation for being hot and cold continued. Took Imitrex to alleviate the headache/migraine . I did help, but not much. Hard to eat due to an upset stomach. Today is the first full day. I hope I&#39;m better tomorrow

Shakin lasted for over 2hrs at which point I took 2 Tylenols. After 20min the shaking decreased. The shaking came back about 1.5hrs later. At that point I took 2 ibuprofens. The shaking went away. The entire following day had mild fever. have been tired physically for a week now after receiving the vaccine. Lost sense of smell and taste on the 3rd day after vaccination. It has since slowly improved. Botox injection sites (received Botox injection for migraine on March 4, 2 days before the J&amp;J vaccine) are still slightly red a week after the vaccine. My facial skin is breaking out also. Vaginal yeast infection started 4 days after receiving the vaccination. I feel slower than usual in my thinking processes since the vaccination.

All over body aches, no appetite, weakness, fatigue, headache, nasal congestion, burning eyes, ataxia, lightheadedness. Took my AM meds including hydrocodone-APAP which caused the fever to break but stayed low grade until the following afternoon around 2 PM. Helped with the body aches somewhat as well. Appetite started to return this morning, 3 days after the vaccine but the fatigue, weakness, muscular pain and a general unwell feeling continues.

                                                Approximately a half hour after the Janssen vaccine was administered on Monday, March 15, 2021 at 2:00pm, I felt a dull ache/sensation in the back, lower part of my head. No other symptoms that day. Today is Tuesday,  March 23 and I am still experiencing side effects from the vaccine. The side effects, other than the &#34;brain ache&#34; come and go. The side effects include what I can describe as a &#34;brain&#34; ache, some itching (3/16), random sweating, arms feeling like dead weight, overall general feeling sick, random body aches (don&#39;t last long), dragging of feet when walking, noises being louder than what they actually are, brain &#34;fog&#34;, dizziness, nausea, tingling in legs and feet .  What I describe as a &#34;brain ache is a different feeling than a headache or migraine.  It is as if my brain actually hurts. A very notable side effect that occurred on  Wednesday, March 17, was an episode of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. Throughout my life I have experienced AIWS  at bedtime.  On Wednesday, I experienced an episode during the day and it lasted for three hours.  My session is going to log me out.  I cannot type anymore.  Please contact me for more inforamtion.

                                                I was held for approx 30 minutes. Drove out and when driving home started to get short of breath, so turned towards the hospital rather than home and called them. My significant other also had his shot, so we switched spots driving at that time. I called the hospital on my way when I started to feel my throat start to close at exactly 1829 on my phone (6:29 pm.). Appointment was at 6pm for shot. Hospital was 13 minutes away. Half way there my tongue started to swell and my lips slightly with tingle. My breathing was more labored to keep up effort as I could not expand my lungs to capacity. I was always able to breath and speak, my voice did become more raspy.    Upon ER, Blood Pressure was very Hypertensive around 140s/120s with my respiratory effort to get in. Pulse was stable around 70-80. O2 was 97-99.  I was able to lay down and relax my breathing which relaxed my blood pressure to 140s/ 80s. I was given IV Benadryl, IV Dexadron, PO Pepcid with a liter of fluid. Monitor up until after 8pm when I was released with still mild tonge swelling but breathing ok. Continue Benadryl at home with my Epi pen for bees stings available.    Did go to work today 07/08/2021. Was wheezy, SOB, no throat swelling, tongue swelling at base. Kept up with Benadryl. Made it 1/2 day and went home. Walking and movement makes increase lung workload. My staff concerned with effort and flush skin while getting supplies. But flush and redness does subside some with rest. When talking need to take a break to breath. But can today notice when Benadryl kicks in. No history of Asthma ever or breathing issues ever. Very active on my farm and at work.

                                                I am not sure if my event was caused by the vaccine I received on  April 8, but I have a very strong feeling it is, as never in my life have I experienced anything like it.  My day began normally, and I just had returned home from an appointment.  I had some lunch, and a few minutes later as I was standing in my kitchen,  I began sweating terribly,  heart was racing, and I felt like I was going to pass out.  I  managed to make it to a large living room chair, and once I say down and put my head back, I passed out.   My daughter witnessed everything and said when I passed out, my arms were trembling and my eyes rolled back.  This lasted for about 30 seconds.  She was unable to arouse me for a bit, but when I came to my speech was slurred.   I did not know what had happened.  My daughter called 911.  By the time medics arrived, I was feeling much better and aware of everything happening.  The checked for signs of stroke, vital signs, blood sugar, and everything was normal.   I was transported to the ER, and my work up there was normal, including EKG and blood work.  The physician that I saw diagnosed me with  vasovagal syncope and did not feel the event was related to the vaccine.  I  completely recovered, and like I said  I?m not sure if it was related to the vaccine I received or not.  I just feel that it may be worth noting since I?ve never had an experience like this and  I?m pretty healthy with really no medical history.

                                                On the night of my J&amp;J my vaccine , I felt very tired and sleepy but I could not sleep. The next morning I felt a burning sensation to my eyes as well to my right ear and that went away. I went to see my PCP that day as well because I was having a pressure sensation down my right calf and leg. On Wednesday I felt numbness sensation down my right arm and the right side of my body was weak. On Thursday, I called my PCP who advised me to go to the ER and to get monitored for thrombosis. I also began to have headaches and blurry vision. At the ER they performed an ultrasound and did lab work. The ultrasound exam did not show evidence of thrombosis or blood clots. The ER physicians told me to rest and elevate my legs. I also noticed that  my BP was 130/90 which I never had before. To this day I still have throbbing sensation to my right calf and leg.  I again went to the ER and thy monitored me. They told me to take Ibuprofen for pain and again did an ultrasound which did not show any blood clots. I then started to have a burning sensation to my skull and scalp and also my left arm. I have not fully recovered from my symptoms.

By April 8th my symptoms we greatly reduced.  My vaccination spot remained red and wam for the retainer of that week.  I have had a headache since April 13,  2021.  On April 24th I noticed a rash the softball size at my injection site that included lots of red dots all around.  There was also warmth in the rash area.  I went to unspecified pharmacy with my headaches and rash.   Due to my symptoms I was referred to emergency department.

She also stated her tongue felt a little tingly and numb.  She was taken into our immunization room and she started out seating then decided she would feel better laying down. We gave her a half of a Benadryl to help with the nausea. She was given cold compresses, water and some ice to suck on. Her blood pressure was taken and was 122/70 mmHg, heart rate was 58 bpm.  She was laying down for approximately 20 minutes, then stated she was feeling better and moved to a sitting position. She was felt she was improving, and after a few minutes of sitting decided she felt well enough to leave. She did state as she was leaving that she has a similar reaction when she gets blood drawn and that she had been nervous about getting the shot.

As I was driving my left leg was getting stiff, got a spasm. No side effects on my left arm. I also had a bad headache at night. I drank plenty of fluids, I do massages to relieve the pain. I also did peppermint oil and my back upper back was hurting bad on Sunday morning and by the afternoon my right arm was swollen, my joints in my hands hurt and could feel and was having pain opening and closing my hand. The rest of the week, I had constant headaches. My headaches are more intense behind my right eyeball. As the days went by I started to feel tingling sensation to my right side of my face and jaw which lasts about 6 seconds. I&#39;ve had it also on my left side of my face. My legs feel very heavy and weak and I feel my les feel like they will give out. I also feel my joints hurt, on my right foot, where my joints start fusing together, my doctor prescribed a cream for my joint pain to my feet. The pain I feel on my arms, back and legs is still present. On my left shoulder I feel pain to my collar bone. I also get this pain on my back on my shoulder blade, right side as well, like a pricking, poking sensation, this pain comes and goes. I also started to have bladder issues, where I&#39;ve lost muscle control and will be seen by an urologist on 06-04-2021.  These are pain that I did not experience before. My right knee also got inflamed, to the inside part of my knee and pain to my right calf that comes and goes. I had an U/S of the right calf which are still pending.    I also did an anti body test; i do  not have the virus for covid.

                                                Ten minutes after I received the vaccine, my left arm and leg felt very heavy, like I was uneven. I started to feel very dizzy and my left eye became very blurry. I started feeling nauseous, as well. On the car ride home I noticed a rash. We thought it was an allergic reaction. After I got out of the car I noticed it went away. It came back later again, around my neck that evening, but it only lasted 5 minutes. It was a rash with white bumps and then it went away. At night I experienced chills. When I woke up I had a blistering headache with neck pain that lasted a couple days. The nausea and balance picked up and got worse. I spent two weeks being unable to see, walk, read or drive safely. I have had to take time off of work. I cannot view a computer screen without feeling nauseous. Most of the first week I spent on the floor because of the nausea and spinning issues. I sought medical treatment. I had a CAT scan and they ruled out a blood clot. I still have low grade nausea. I have regained peripheral vision in my left eye, which was missing for three weeks. I have been off work for more than 2 weeks. I still cannot work at my normal capacity. I still have a very strong chemical taste in my mouth. It is getting less and less, but I can still taste it. I&#39;ve have a lot of swelling at the base of my skull, that has not resolved.

                                                Since last report the chemical taste in my mouth went away. I managed to get bac my balance, ability to read, drive and my left and right side are working together again, vision has improved, pain continues at base of neck. I still have some nausea with the ear issue. The tinnitus has gotten worse but only on left ear, It was buzzing but now it is loud ringing. On 06/14/2021 I started getting a fullness of fluid and pain in left ear. I am also having runny eye in left eye, almost allergy like, the eye thing has cleared but the ear thing has not, lymph nodes still very swollen. I did get a cat scan before to rule out a clot and stroke symptoms so they did rule out stroke symptoms. I am redhead and I have heard that people with red hair are more sensitive to the vaccine and I am also small in stature so possibly the dose might be too high. I am also very sensitive to most meds.

                                                Bell&#39;s palsy symptoms within an hour after receiving vaccine injection:  consisted of right-sided facial numbness, right-sided eyelid droop, right-sided mouth turn, right-sided tightness in neck muscle, pressure behind right eye, headache, loss of balance, difficulty speaking.  The injection was at 3:15 pm and started with arm soreness and stinging, a slight headache, and some tingling in my right hand while waiting 15 minutes after the shot, I had also felt a sensation going up the right side of the back of my neck almost immediately after the injection.  The Bell&#39;s palsy symptoms started by 4:00 pm.  I had a low-grade temp that evening of 99.9.  I emailed my neurologist who I see for migraines, of my symptoms.  The following morning on 03-10-2021 I woke with a severe migraine, fullness in my right ear, more pressure behind my right eye and it is watery, with new ringing in both ears, louder in the right ear.   Still residual numbness and drooping of right side of face and eye, tightness in right side neck muscle in front, and speaking better.   Woke up on Thursday morning 03-11-2021 with flu symptoms and migraine gone.  Eye pressure still there and now having significant pain moving my eye and now more feeling of fullness in my right ear.  Eye pain was concerning.  Dr advised me at this time if symptoms have continued or gotten worse to go to the emergency room.   Today, Saturday 03-13-2021, I am still experiencing moderate eye pain behind/above my right eye with pressure.  I am continuing to treat the pain with oxycodone prescribed by ER Physician.

                                                (Pharmacy was the pharmacy that provided the Vaccination.)  I had fever, headache and body aches that started 24 hours after and they lasted about 36 hours. OTC cold and pain medication was taken for those. I had significant swelling under my left arm in the armpit. That lasted for about a week. At the same time as the fever, headache and body aches started, I had swelling under the eyes that started in the upper eyelids for about a week and that went down to the lower lids about a week post vaccination and since then it has been upper and lower eyelids - significant swelling and on March 30th  (started me on the Prednisone on this date)  - it initially helped and then it went back to worse than it was before. and on April 7th  Benadryl and Neomycin- a topical steroid I&#39;ve been applying under the eyes for that.  The swelling was significant until this last Wednesday when I got on these two meds. Today I had a phone call visit with my doctor as a follow up to how the meds were doing. Recovery is progressing at this time.

No blue lips, no rash/hive, no swelling of tongue, lips or face, no difficulty breathing or swallowing.  Just numbness in lips and tingling feeling on tongue, all over mouth.   The numbness felt like novacaine shot you would get if you were getting dental work done.  Numbness in lips lasted about 3 hours but gradually reduced to just tingling feeling after.  The tingling feeling in my mouth gradually got better every hour after that.  It still lasted all night.  It did not completely go away until the next morning.  After the morning, numbness and tingling sensation went away.

                                                Approximated 12-13 minutes after receiving the shot; my respiration increased, heart rate, and my vision became blurred.  I reported the blurred vision to the Pharmacist and she said they have not heard reports forth this symptom.  Based upon events following the injection relative to my blood pressure; it is likely that my blood pressure became elevated following the injection, resulting in blurred vision.  My blurred vision   resolved several minutes later.  However, my heart rate increased later that evening to the point I slept upright in my recliner that evening.  During sleep, I awoke from my sleep gasping because my heart felt like it was beating too slowly.  It has not been several weeks since receiving the injection, and during this time period, my Blood Pressure (BP) has been fluctuating from &#34;very high&#34; to normal.  Yesterday, I presented to the ER due to High Blood Pressure (145/100), by the recommendation of a NP.   I have NEVER had any history of high BP prior to the injection.

My ears started ringing and the noise in the room sounded like it was in slow motion.  I started to feel dizzy and clammy like I was going to pass out.  I got up and walked over to the paramedic and he sat me down and took my vitals.  All of my vitals were fine and I started to come out of the feeling of passing out.  After waiting another couple of minutes I went outside to get fresh and was able to go home.  I felt very tired and just not quite right the rest of the day and slept most of the day.  I was ok after that with just a fatigue and headache in the following days.

The pain persisted despite taking an analgesic and the next day still felt throbbing that was reflected in the head in general and in the eye area.

                                                I waited in the pharmacy for 15 minutes; soon after I got in my car to drive home and felt a strange sensation on the left side of my face.  While driving, my entire left side went numb.   I kept checking my face in the rear-view mirror to see if it was drooping.  It was not.  My upper lip  appeared and felt swollen.   Six days later, on March 28th, I came down with a really bad migraine.  It started in my left eye and then was a really bad headache.  I called the eye doctor the following day because the pain was not subsiding.  The migraine lasted from Sunday, March 28th to Wednesday, March 31st.   Following the migraine, I have been getting headaches (not as severe, but still painful) almost daily.   The headache is not over my eyes or in the temple.   Instead the headaches are on the top of my head and towards the back.    Today is three weeks and two days after my vaccine, and I am still having headaches on the top of my head.

Wednesday I felt the same and nauseous in the evening. I had iced my lymph nodes and that helped a little with the soreness. (Took IB off/on since Monday as I thought I had a low fever and was achey/headachey). Thursday, I noticed that the soreness/pain in my lymph nodes moved up my jaw and to my ear (on the side where I got the vaccine). I still felt weak and tired. I tried to work at 11:15a and felt my brain couldn&#39;t quite think straight. Today (Fri.), pain in jaw/side of head and headache continue. Think the swollen glands are making it hurt when I swallow. Felt a little something in my leg; but would not say it was painful. NO abdominal pain or trouble breathing.

                                                About 3 hours after receiving the , vaccine on April 5 at 3:15 pm, I had uncontrollable shivers and chills, shaking violently through my whole entire body.  I was freezing cold to the bone.   I felt nauseous and threw up my entire dinner.  That didn&#39;t make the nausea go away - I continued to throw up that evening 5 or 6 more times.  The nausea continued the next day making me throw up 3 more times.  And yet the nausea persisted for a whole entire week.  I had a horrible headache that night that has stuck with me these last ten days.  My muscles ached and shot strange pangs through my body.  I was exhausted.  I could not stay awake.  I was so weak and tired.  I had no energy and just laid in bed for a solid four days. My throat hurt, my neck hurt, my head hurt, my arm where the shot went in hurt so bad.  Very strangely, my stomach was constantly bloated and hurt inside like a bad stomach ache - even if I hadn&#39;t eaten anything it still bloated and hurt.  The painful stomach lasted seven or eight days.  I had diarrhea for those seven /eight days.  I was completely dehydrated.  The diarrhea lasted way too long - it was difficult to return to work.  The second day after the shot I woke up to my left eye red, like some blood vessels had burst.  It took four or five days for my eye to go back to normal.   my heart has a stabbing feeling randomly all the time now and it is hard to breathe.  I wheeze and cough all the time.  It is very uncomfortable.  This heart issue has persisted the entire time since getting the vaccine.

                                                Within 5 minutes of the shot, I started to have difficulty swallowing. I notified the staff at the clinic, They put me in a separate room where I took 50mg Benadryl. I continued having difficulty swallowing along with tingling in tongue and lips. I then decided to give myself an Epipen 0.3mg shot. I had this with me because I had a severe allergic reaction in January to Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. 911 was called. In the ambulance, IV Benadryl and Solu-Medrol was administered. My face was starting to itch on the way to hospital even after IV medication administered.  I was monitored for 2 hours in hospital. I was also given normal saline IV in the hospital. I was discharged with Pepcid 20mg daily for 4 days and Prednisone 50mg daily for 3 days. I consistently had to take Benadryl 50mg for three days to keep itching and swelling at bay.

                                                That evening, I began to have difficulty breathing as I did after out of quarantine from COVID. I used my inhaler prescribed to me from having covid in November of 2020. That helped. Then about a week later I started to have leg pain. Not sharp pain, but achey pain in both legs that can not be controlled by Tylenol or Ibuprofen. It has been occurring every few days and some nights like last night are bothersome and I can not sleep well. Also after about a week, I had dryness and redness on the bottom part of my mouth and chin.  In the last week I have had flush on my neck and chest.  It is hot, sometimes causes dryness and pealing and is sometimes itchy.

                                                The adverse reactions of light headedness, throat irritation, heaviness in my chest and difficulty inhaling began about 20 min after my injection, It lasted 5 minutes. About 30 min afterwards the 2nd wave of reaction came on, with the same symptoms but was even harder to inhale and lasted twice as long. I took a combination of benadryl, motrin and pepcid which alleviated the worst of the symptoms after about an hour. To this day, I still cannot take a deep breath in.  About 72 hours after the vaccine I began to have diarrhea (and still have it 20 days later), lethargy, nausea and shortness of breath. The next day I had a little more energy, but still had continued shortness of breath. My vision had become less clear and my thought process a bit fuzzy. This is still happening today. Seven days after the vaccine,  I suddenly became extremely light headed just simply walking. To the extent that I needed to sit or lay down before I began to pass out. After the light headedness came on heavily, I also noticed a very heavy weight on my upper chest and found it quite difficult to inhale. These moments would come and go throughout the day. Regardless of whether I was just sitting and relaxing or walking around. These symptoms would last anywhere from a couple minutes to a couple of hours. I found it very hard to catch my breath and could feel my heart flushing often. Additionally I would wake in the middle of the night feeling that I needed to gasp for air. I sought medical assistance from a clinic, an ER and even my allergist and I am scheduled to see my family physician later this week.   I am not an anxious person, but have experienced many episodes in the last 20 days that have truly made me feel that I was going to die (no exaggeration!) due to the inability to breathe or that I may have been having a heart attack. I began to have chest pain that would travel from the center of my chest to my left shoulder. The pain also would move to my right lung area. During this I also had heaviness in my chest and felt I could not breathe in or out easily. I am still very light headed and have difficulty walking very far without taking a break because I feel I cannot catch my breath. I still have all of the same symptoms that I experienced 20 minutes after my vaccine. These symptoms have varied in intensity. I have often commented to my family that I feel the symptoms of the chest heaviness and heart flushing seem to come in waves. I am a health conscious person and have never had poor health in my life. The events in the last few weeks have definitely taught me how terrible life must be for those who chronically suffer from heart or lung issues. I am still currently battling these symptoms, however, the last few days seem the symptoms have often been less severe.

The fever and flu symptoms went away after 24 hours but the stabbing chest pain lasted for 37 days. The pain was in the center of my chest in different places and it felt like tightening and clenching. The D-Dimer  was elevated and other tests were normal. My Platelets were tested later and were normal. Doctors indicated it was an inflammatory immune response. I went to a Cardiologist for a Stress test which showed ST depression. The chest pain stopped after 37 days. I did have shortness of breath which came and went over the course of four weeks. I am normally in good shape and I run, dance and work out two to four times a week. I have been unable to work out since this began. I also had lightheadedness, chest pain and palpitations seemed to go together. I still have lower back pain and Tinnitus which started two and a half weeks after the shot. It has been five weeks.

                                                The adverse reactions of light headedness, throat irritation, heaviness in my chest and difficulty inhaling began about 20 min after my injection, It lasted 5 minutes. About 30 min afterwards the 2nd wave of reaction came on, with the same symptoms but was even harder to inhale and lasted twice as long. I took a combination of benadryl, motrin and pepcid which alleviated the worst of the symptoms after about an hour. To this day, I still cannot take a deep breath in.  About 72 hours after the vaccine I began to have diarrhea (and still have it 20 days later), lethargy, nausea and shortness of breath. The next day I had a little more energy, but still had continued shortness of breath. My vision had become less clear and my thought process a bit fuzzy. This is still happening today. Seven days after the vaccine,  I suddenly became extremely light headed just simply walking. To the extent that I needed to sit or lay down before I began to pass out. After the light headedness came on heavily, I also noticed a very heavy weight on my upper chest and found it quite difficult to inhale. These moments would come and go throughout the day. Regardless of whether I was just sitting and relaxing or walking around. These symptoms would last anywhere from a couple minutes to a couple of hours. I found it very hard to catch my breath and could feel my heart flushing often. Additionally I would wake in the middle of the night feeling that I needed to gasp for air. I sought medical assistance from a clinic, an ER and even my allergist and I am scheduled to see my family physician later this week.   I am not an anxious person, but have experienced many episodes in the last 20 days that have truly made me feel that I was going to die (no exaggeration!) due to the inability to breathe or that I may have been having a heart attack. I began to have chest pain that would travel from the center of my chest to my left shoulder. The pain also would move to my right lung area. During this I also had heaviness in my chest and felt I could not breathe in or out easily. I am still very light headed and have difficulty walking very far without taking a break because I feel I cannot catch my breath. I still have all of the same symptoms that I experienced 20 minutes after my vaccine. These symptoms have varied in intensity. I have often commented to my family that I feel the symptoms of the chest heaviness and heart flushing seem to come in waves. I am a health conscious person and have never had poor health in my life. The events in the last few weeks have definitely taught me how terrible life must be for those who chronically suffer from heart or lung issues. I am still currently battling these symptoms, however, the last few days seem the symptoms have often been less severe.

                                                I received my vaccine at 5;35pm on Thursday 4/8/21. I started feeling arm soreness in both arms and developed a headache, I took  Tylenol at 10pm. I woke up at 3am Friday morning with body aches and still had the headache. I took more Tylenol. By 9am Friday morning I had severe adverse reactions. I still had a severe headache and body aches with muscle soreness and extreme fatigue. I also experienced chills, light sensitivity and brain fog. Around 4:30 pm I developed chest pains that lasted about one hour. My headache, body aches and fatigue have not subsided as of today. I have had a televisit with my physicians office on may 10 where bloodwork. Some of my headaches rk was requested. The results showed elevated kidney function due to the amount of Advil I had taken to control the headache and muscle soreness. The recommended Tylenol did not alleviate my headache or muscle soreness so I have not taken either medicine.  Some of my headaches have been accompanied with nausea and light sensitivity. I went for a physical exam on 5/18/21 and more bloodwork was requested. It has been 6 weeks and these adverse effects have not subsided.

Had an ear infection and was given a ten day regimen of amoxicillin. My ear is much better today.

Had an odd white noise in my ears - not &#34;ringing&#34; but buzzing kind of sound. Lasted for about 3-5 minutes and I ended up lying on the floor for about 15 minutes before I could get back up. Felt like I may blackout. It&#39;s three hours later and I&#39;m ok now.

I started breaking out in hives , coughing and trying to clear my throat.  I was taken to the medical area and given a dose of liquid Benadryl.  Within 20 minutes it was easier to breathe and my blood pressure and pulse ox returned to normal.  About 3 hours later I started to get itchy again around my throat and ears.  Per the guidance of the nurse at the vaccine site, I took 2 - 25mg Benadryl tablets.  By the next morning I felt better.

It all was heavy and number and tingling.  That continued most of the day.  The next day I was extremely fatigued and weak and stayed in bed.  I think had left ear and lymph node pain on the left side of my face and neck.  This continued for days.  By the 1 week mark after my injection, I ended up at the urgent care with facial swelling and extreme lymph node pain.  They stated it was an adverse reaction to the vaccine.  As of yesterday, I continue to have some swelling in my jaw and occipital region as noted by the PTA where I go for physical therapy.  I continue to experience extreme fatigue, worse than normal and dizziness.  My left pinky still has some tingling and vibration feeling.  I also still get cramping on this finger and on the ulnar side of my palm.

                                                10 days after the vaccine I developed dizziness, tachycardia, dry mouth,chest pressure, shortness of breath and felt like I was going to pass out, and I had a feeling of extreme doom. I was transported to a clinic. There I had a heart rate of 140 with irregular beats. Continued feeling of doom. An EKG showed ST depression. Symptoms improved with nitroglycerin. The clinic didn&#39;t have the technology to provide care so I was emergently transported again. At that hospital my D-dimer was positive and that lead to a CT Angiogram. This showed a pulmonary embolism. Doppler studies of both legs were negative. I was placed on Heparin for several hours and then switched to Eliquis. About 6 hours after being on Eliquis I had the exact same original symptoms and again nitro was given which helped the symptoms. I was placed back on Heparin for a longer period of time. Once I was anticoagulated I was then switch to Eliquis 10mg BID for 7 days then 5mg BID for 6-9 months. I had a CT Angiogram of the head and neck which was normal. At this time I still have dizziness with standing and intermittently with sitting, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath.

That subsided within a day and then joint pain, muscle pain in legs, hips and rear end, shoulders and pain behind eyes started and lasted for about a week.  I have had a steady headache for probably the past 6 days or so.  No fevers, just significant muscle pain and headache, low energy and difficulty sleeping.

                                                The night after the night of my vaccine I had a tightening of my whole left side, from my eye, down my neck, into my shoulder and chest and down left arm.  Then I started to get shooting pain all around my shoulder blades.  I brushed it off thinking that most people had complaints of feeling pain or sick the few days after their vaccines and then they said it went away.  Mine never went away.  After about 5 days it really started to worry me.  The pain was very intense- unbearable even- and i couldnt move my left arm or lie back in any way without incredible pain.  I called urgent care and they told me I could come in if the pain was bad but that maybe I wanted to see my regular physician to see what was going on.  I made an appointment with my doctor but it wasn?t until the end of the next week.  After 8 days, I couldn?t take it anymore.  I went to urgent care- they did an EKG and a chest xray and said all was normal.  They gave me an anti-inflammatory (naproxen) and a muscle relaxer. They took blood and the only thing they noted to me was that I should have my doctor check my platelette count.  They told me they thought it must be muscular.  I went home.  Neither of those medications seemed to help.  The pain was less in the day when I was moving around, but towards the end of the day it was getting so bad (still is) that I can?t sleep or get comfortable.  My doctor did blood work and couldn?t seem to find the source of what was going on with me either.  She prescribed me a new anti-inflammatory (meloxicam), a new muscle relaxer (cyclobenzaprine) and a pain killer (hydrocodone acetamin).  Sometimes those medications help- they knock me out- but when I wake up I feel the same.  I can?t take them in the day because they make me too loopy and tired.  I don?t know what is wrong. I can?t seem to get answers and  nobody can figure it out.  It is definitely my left side. I feel it in ky head, my chest, my shoulder and down my left arm and it has been almost 5 weeks.  It seems to be getting worse not better.  Looking for help or direction please

                                                Immediately after shot ...probably within 10 minutes or so I had vasodilation of my sinuses &amp; headache. It came together &amp; was quick like feeling inside of my nose swell &amp; slight headache. I WAS VACCINATED WITH MY DAUGHTER 18 YRS OLD WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES AND SON 20 WITH PRIOR HISTORY OF DENGUE IN PHILIPPINES. At night as it was getting dark,severe symptoms hit us at home all around the same time. Severe excruciating pain in the back of our head and it ran down into our necks &amp; jaw. I have had migraines &amp; it was worse pain in the back of the head. My son said it felt like dengue when he spent a week in the hospital,which comes with low platelets count. To me it felt like when I had infection in my left mound after double mastectomy and spent five days in hospital hooked to Ivs with 2 antibiotics &amp; they thought I had staff &amp; going septic. I had horrible headache with that. My daughter reacted the worse,she was crying with head pain &amp; shivering non-stop &amp; her body aches hit all over first. She slept with a hot pad on her head &amp; had ringing in the ears &amp; if she tried to get up she heard rushing water sound in ears &amp; felt like going to pass out. My body aches hit as I was trying to get strength to drive to ER if needs be,but if felt like crippling arthritis in arms wrists jaw legs knees &amp; ankles. I slept with hit pad on my head &amp; would move it to joints. Really none of us slept. Son had body aches all night too. Bad headache in back of head for all of us. Took 2 arthritis tylenil. All had stomach aches. Yesterday I was spinning &amp; severely dizzy. We are fatigued &amp; barely moving.

                                                Literally within a few minutes of receiving the vaccine my tongue started to swell a bit.  That sensation lasted about 4-5  hours.  About an hour after receiving the vaccine my lips also swelled a bit(that lasted about 2-3  hours).  I did speak with a paramedic at the vaccination site (about the tongue) and we both felt like I was ok enough to go without further care.  I was informed by him that if I felt worse during the day to call 911.  The tongue and lips swelling was never severe enough to feel it warranted calling 911 or going to emergency room.  I would classify them both as &#34;slight&#34; swelling. That evening I also suffered from the flu-like aches and pains that were expected as possible side effects.  Those flu like symptoms went away 24 hours later.  It was really the swelling that I felt important to properly report.

This continued for three days before she returned to the pharmacy to report the reaction. Because of the throat involvement it was recommended to the patient to follow up with her doctor as soon as possible and report to the ER if she at any point has difficulty breathing. She reports that it is worse at night. She said that the reaction feels similar to her seafood allergy but she only reports tightness and tingling not difficulty breathing.

Also started feeling some tightness in the left eye today. Have a Dr appointment but on May 17th and going to urgent care today. Advised to go to HCF instead of urgent just to ensure they can get imaging, US and appropriate testing&#39;s to r/o all cause of complications.  4/20-f/u pc to caller; couldn&#39;t sleep last night; used a heating pad on her leg but didn&#39;t work; states both legs hurt; feel tight; 4/10 pain; worried when also saw spots on her left leg and became concerned because saw news of clots; the episode started with tightness of her right leg which progressed to most of leg as well as left leg. Has not gotten worse today and denies any concominant effects. Normally healthy. Did not go to the hospital because says she wouldn&#39;t be able to afford it. Has appointment with primary care in 2 weeks.   rec&#39;d that since she is still ok today then it&#39;s likely ok to skip the ER and go see MD as planned; warned to go to the ER right away or dial 911 if any of the following effects: sudden shortness of breath, severe headache, vision changes, loss of motor or/sensory function, chest pain. Call us back if having any effects at all besides the ones already noted so we may help determine if needs ER care.

                                                Within 5 minutes from receiving my J&amp;J vaccine, I went to sit down and I started feeling very hot in my body. My heart started to race, had chest discomfort and had trouble breathing, my trachea closed up, had blurry vision and pain in my chest. I felt like I could not breathe and when the nurse came over to ask me I could not speak to her, I went into a shock and I was placed on the floor and I could not hear anything nor could open my eyes, from my hips down to my feet I could not feel anything, my legs went completely numb and I had a syncope. What I was told from the nurse that I was given an Epi-pen to help with my reaction. When I came back my body was having convulsions, felt my head spinning, had pain in my chest that so very intense and the nurse got me up and took me to a nearby ambulance and the EMT staff placed like a heart monitor because my heart was racing super fast. I also felt heaviness in my chest and inside the ambulance I was given two injections on my left arm and when I slowly started coming back, I was already at the hospital. I was at the hospital from 2pm to 4:30pm more less being monitored.  At the hospital x-ray of the chest was performed as well as lab work and I was discharged home. When I got home, I still did not feel good, I felt heaviness to my chest, still have trouble breathing and get chills during the night. I also could not stand up and have a nerve sensation to my body and the chest pain to my left side is still very present. I have blurry vision, dizziness, headaches, and my heart-beat continues to race very fast.  I get headaches, have abdominal pain and I peed blood few times then that&#39;s when I was able to pee, my abdominal pain was painful like having a baby. On Friday 04-08-2021, I again went to the hospital because I had fallen to the floor on my kitchen floor and my daughter took me to the hospital. I let the nurse staff know that I still have continued chest pain and pressure, difficulty breathing and headaches, dizziness and they monitored and gave me three pills as medication. I was discharged home about 5pm with a referral to see a neurologist due to my chest pain, blurry vision, dizziness and fever which I had these past three weeks. I do not know why I felt all these symptoms after my J&amp;J vaccine.

                                                Hello, I received the J&amp;J vaccine on 3/12/2021. Eight days later on the 20th when I went to bed I had a lot of pain in my left heel and left thumb.   The next day, on a Sunday, the pain was now in my left heel, left thumb at the big knuckle and top and bottom below my thumb, and just behind the inside of my left ankle, and I had a terrible headache.   I was unable to grasp anything or widen my grip because the pain was so intense in my thumb.  It was so bad I went to my local ER who did xrays and told me it was just osteoarthritis.   The next day,  Monday, the pain was terrible. It was in my left thumb, the middle of my left hand, left ankle, the arch of my left foot top and bottom, the big knuckle at the bottom of my left big toe, my right hand was also now hurting at my middle finger the big knuckle at the bottom. I went to see my family doctor who really was unsure at the time what was going on and said it&#39;s still just must be the osteoarthritis. The next day on Tuesday I still have the headache I was out unable to open my own water bottles or prescription bottles because the pain was so intense in my left hand. It was now extremely painful to walk on my left foot and I had no appetite. The following day on Wednesday the pain was bad and my right hand that I was unable to touch my ring finger or my pinky with my thumb. As hard as I try my thumb just would not reach those two fingers oh. I now couldn&#39;t open any of the doors in my house unless I use the base of my Palms on both hands turn the knob. I now couldn&#39;t even comb my own hair or pull my pants up wipe myself properly. I couldn&#39;t hold a pencil or anything because the pain was so unbearable. I had no appetite and now I have diarrhea. I called my husband at work and had him come home and we went to the emergency room because it was a bigger facility. The doctor there told me he thought it was something more like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. This was by far my worst d ay even though I was unable to work this entire week. Oh and did I mention the only reason I got that back who was because my boss with bullying me and pressuring me every day to get the vaccine. He even went so far as to come of my office and he wanted to use my keyboard to schedule my vaccine himself. The next day on Thursday I was still having a hard time walking I still couldn&#39;t touch my ring finger on my pinky with my right hand still unable to open anything with either one of my hands. My husband had to open all the water bottles and prescription bottles and just set the caps on them before he went to work.  I now had flashing light in my eyes which lasted about a week. The following day I had all the same symptoms but now my left foot was so swollen I couldn&#39;t even get a shoe on it. The big knuckle at the base of my right hand hurts so bad at this point and so does the big knuckle at the base of my left thumb. The swelling and the pain is just unbearable at this point. The following day on Saturday my mom had come up from Florida and stay with me for two weeks take care of me someday the next day on March 28th I start all the same symptoms but now my muscles were quivering on the back of both thighs. By the middle of next week I still had all of the same pain and now I&#39;m realizing that I can&#39;t span open my fingers on my right hand and I&#39;m unable to snap my fingers. Side note as of today I still cannot snap my fingers on my right hand. At this point I have been keeping a diary every day of where my pain was in what the pain level was each day. So strange that it&#39;s affecting joints on both sides but just in my hands the inside of my wrist and my left foot. Are April 28th I finally got into the rheumatologist. He had me go to the hospital and get blood work done and x-rays. On Thursday May 6th I was unable to go to work. It seems like I can go to work about 3 days a week and the pain is so intense that I&#39;m missing about two days a week. Dr called me and said all of my tests came negative for rheumatoid arthritis.He told me not just because I was a patient but if I was his own sister he would suggest going to the Clinic right away. He said they have a larger database and if anybody else was having the same reaction to the covid vaccine they would know about it. My husband came home from work and made the four-hour drive to the Clinic. I was there Thursday and Friday they the blood work a sonogram x-rays the whole gamut of tests. The rheumatologist in the ER said that he thinks it&#39;s still something like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus but that was in the early stages and not showing up positive on the test. On Friday I met with dr. a rheumatologist oh, and the chairman at the Clinic. They said this is a very rare reaction to the J&amp;J vaccine and they&#39;re hopeful by prescribing me a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and Voltaren gel that hopefully I will have some relief within a week and they were hopeful that the symptoms will go away within 3 months. They also took me off work for the next week. Did I mention got the first month that was going on they have me on 50 mg of Prednisone for one week then 100 mg of Prednisone for 2 weeks and then back down to 50 mg for one week. After being on that high dosage of Prednisone for an entire month I still have all of the swelling and pain in my joints. My joints are very stiff at this point. The prednisone maybe eased the pain just a touch but the pain and swelling was definitely there, and the pain is excruciating. I&#39;m feeling so alone, and scared because I don&#39;t know anybody else that&#39;s having the same reaction. I&#39;m also fearful I&#39;m going to lose my job I&#39;m missing so much work. But I also feel like my boss pressured me into this and now I&#39;m suffering. If anybody is having the same reactions to Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine please reach out to me. I have my vaccination card I can show you and I have a ton of doctor and  hospital records to verify my story. I&#39;m really worried because I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on with me, how long it&#39;s going to last, and is it going to come back if I do get these symptoms to go away.  My work place offers no paid extended leave, and has repeatedly asked me I&#39;d I was quitting my job.   I&#39;m only having these problems because I was pressured and bullied into getting this vaccine. I completely blame my boss. I would have never got vaccinated if he wasn&#39;t on me about it every single day repeatedly. I&#39;m at a loss as to what to do from here. I have no income coming in. Do I qualify for unemployment or some sort of disability benefits? If anybody can please give me some suggestions I&#39;m open to whatever you have to say

I had side effects one week after the vaccine. I had headaches and I had no energy at all. I was tested for Covid-19 four weeks after the vaccine. I think I contracted it from my father a few days after the vaccine. My ear hurt and my jaw kept popping. I felt really bad. I was given antibiotics and steroids, but I still feel bad after two weeks.

Several weeks later, more moderate, more persistent vertigo returned and persisted for several weeks off and on, accompanied by extreme fatigue and tinnitus.  Because I had had one previous, weeklong episode of severe vertigo in 2018, a specialist diagnosed me with probable Meniere?s disease based on this second episode that began about a month after my Covid19 Janssen vaccine.  It is not my belief that it was necessarily caused by the vaccine, but I thought I should report the information.

                                                After the vaccination, I felt a little dizzy waiting in the parking lot and had a sore arm, but felt fine otherwise.  (12:00-1:00 pm)  After returning home, I felt increasingly tired and warm.  I laid down  and took my temperature after walking the dog around 3:00 pm.  My temperature read 99 degrees.   I drank a lot of pedialyte to hydrate.  Throughout the afternoon, I felt sluggish and the glands seemed to swell up on the side of my neck. I also got a headache.   My temperature dropped down to 98.7 before I went to bed, but this morning, my glands under my jawline are a bit more swollen and I still have a slight temperature; 98.9 degrees.  My eyelids are puffy and I feel a little feverish, but it is tolerable.

Emergency Department Attending Attestation Note   See resident/PA/student note for further details of HPI, history, exam, ED course, and diagnoses.   Briefly, this is a 51 y.o. female with PMH reviewed in chart and w/ patient notable for insulin dependent diabetes, depression, prothrombin mutation, migraine, p/w concern for allergic reaction.  Emesis or change in Covid vaccine today.  10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, patient reports feeling thick in her tongue with tingling in her lips.  Patient was given Zertec.  The minutes later, her lips began to swell up and was also noted to have new erythematous rash between her eyes and forehead.  Patient was given 50 mg of Benadryl.  Patient felt like she could not swallow with worsening lip swelling.  She was given EpiPen and 911 was called. No stridors.  No wheezing.  Reports continued tingling and the numbness in her mouth but no lip swelling or tongue swelling.  Denies any difficulty swallowing at this time.  No wheezing.  No abdominal pain or nausea.  No rash at this time.   Of note, patient also notes left-sided facial, arm, and leg numbness starting about 10 minutes prior to arrival to the emergency department.  She reports that she has had recurrent numbness on the left side in the past, which was thought to be due to migraine versus TIA.  She has had extensive work-up and multiple hospitalization for this symptom.  She reports that she is allergic to iodine and gadolinium containing contrast.  Denies any headache at this time though she had a mild headache after receiving the vaccine.  Denies any blurry vision.  Denies any weakness in her bilateral upper and lower extremities.  Assessment and Plan:    Vital signs notable for O2 sat of 96 to 98% on room air without tachypnea.  Patient is mildly hypertensive.  Patient is well-appearing speaking full sentences without any dysarthria.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Extraocular movement intact.  She notes diminished sensation to her left face, left upper extremity, and left lower extremity.  Tongue is midline.  Hearing is intact bilaterally.  No facial droop.  She has 5 out of 5 strength in bilateral upper and lower extremities.  No pronator drift.  Normal gait.  No tongue swelling or lip swelling.  No stridors.  No uvula swelling.  No pharyngeal or erythema.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezing or rhonchi.  Cardiac exam without murmurs rubs or gallops.  Regular rhythm.  No abdominal distention or tenderness on palpation.  No CVA tenderness.   51-year-old female who is presenting to the emergency department with improving lip swelling and numbness in her mouth, raising a concern for anaphylaxis related to her Covid vaccine.  Reassuringly, status post EpiPen, her symptoms are improving.  However, she has new onset left-sided numbness, with without any headache.  She reports that she has had this numbness in the past the last time she had the numbness on the left side was approximately 10 years ago.  Her neurologic exam is only notable for diffuse numbness on her left side including her face.  Differential diagnosis include migraine headache and TIA.  Stroke is possible though less likely given the patient has had the same symptoms in the past with negative work-up.  Will defer code stroke at this time but will emergently consult neurology.  Will get labs including BMP and CBC.  We will continue to monitor her from the anaphylaxis perspective.  We will also give her a dose of steroid.  Prednisone 60 mg by mouth given 12:29 PM  NEUROLOGY CONSULT NOTE  Assessment: Formulation- Diagnosis is guarded. Localization structurally would suggest subcortical (thalamic) or small brain-stem in a sensory territory on the right. Etiologies could be stroke given her vascular risk factors but seems unlikely given there is stereotypy of earlier symptomatology. Demyelinating would be another possibility as well, but again, the stereotype. Seizure unlikely because of the timing of rush from toes to body was minutes and duration of some occasions being days. Complicated migraine possible, has some risk factors, but should be treated as dx of exclusion. She does make complaint of headache, which could support. Some FND elaboration on her anxiety-ridden allergic reaction is also possible, but no objective non-structural signs to support.

                                                After onset at 6:45, fever rapidly increased to over 102 by 8pm.  Muscle aches and soreness accompanied fever.  Very thirsty.  Fever stayed near 103 overnight until I took tylenol somewhere between 2-4 am.  By 5 am the fever was down to 101.5.  Fever stayed between 101-102 most of the following day (4/6/2021), dropping to 99.5-100 around  6pm.  Stayed low grade under 100 through the night and was back to normal by the morning of 4/7/2021.  I felt mostly normal on 4/7/2021 aside from severe muscle tightness in gluts, hamstrings, and thighs, with soreness in my lower back (unknown if that is related to the vaccine, but it was not present before 4/7/2021).  Today, 4/8/2021 the muscle tightness &amp; soreness remains but the fever is still gone and I feel otherwise normal.

So very cold... had to put on sweat pants to sleep in  took an Aleve at 2 am and again the next day  at 8 am and 2pm and more more at 6 pm.  ran a low 100 degree fever all day the next day.  6 am day two:  Seems to be back to normal.  Don&#39;t know about anything internally. I did feel the shot injected into my arm and it stung and I could feel it &#34;run down&#34; in the arm.   Outside the arm, the injection site seems to just be a tiny sore... nothing that is detracting for me.

I got this sensation about 4 times that day. Twice at vaccine facility and 2 more times at home that same day. Then in the past couple of weeks I?ve had numbness in the right side of my face, arm/hand and leg/foot. Sharp pains in my head, PVC, eye pressure, vision issues, shortness of breath, electric shock sensations through my body, head tingling. Not sure the cause of these symptoms but the only different/new thing was the vaccine.

Onset of right eye not blinking/closing. * MAR 21st = Emergency Room.  Diagnosed w/ BELLS PALSY.  [Ruled out stroke]  The following week after my vaccination (approximately MAR 15th), I experienced a strange feeling at the back of my throat.  It can best described as a &#34;sore throat&#34;.  I noticed it upon waking up.   I could feel it at the back of my throat when swallowing;  the act of swallowing would enable me to &#34;feel&#34; the sensation at the back of my throat.  This was unusual and not normal for me.  I thought I was coming down with a cold virus.  I had not been sick for over a year and thought it was a strange feeling.  I was concerned.  With the recent schools, restaurants, and gyms opening up with less restrictions, I learned from coworkers that there was an increase of illnesses  because our immune systems are not as strong and germs are easily transferable during the usual interactions.  Therefore, I expected my sore throat to be the start of a harmless cold virus.   Then, later in the week (MAR 19th), I noticed my eyes were abnormally dripping tears.  It is my experience that I get this effect in the office setting or during winter when my eyes are &#34;dry&#34;.  However, I was neither in the workplace (office), nor was it winter.  I was not sure why my eyes had excessive tears coming out.  Finally, on SUN (MAR 21st), an obvious physical symptom finally became apparent to me and my family members.  My speech was impaired.  I could not chew properly.  I could not drink from a cup.  I struggled during breakfast.  I was not sure if I was having a STROKE.  I recited the alphabet to hear for a slurred speech.  I looked in the mirror, and my smile was not perfect.   I got dressed and went to the Emergency Room.   The doctors performed physical PUSH-PULL tests, eye tests, etc.   DIAGNOSIS = Bells Palsy.     OTHER SYMPTOMS = &#43; shortness of breath.  &#43; leg swelling.  &#43; headaches.  &#43; excruciating pain in the neck, especially during sleep (laying down).

Within first 3-4 hours had bad rash on arms, legs, face, neck and chest, fast heartrate, breathing and out of it sensation. I felt like I was having a partial analpylaxis reaction - like throat 1/2 closed but that I would be ok. I took Benadryl and used a Ventolin inhaler. Rash was better by 2nd day.  On 2nd and 3rd day I was having massive headache (felt like pressure from inside all over out to all cranial sutures), severe neck stiffness on rt side, lumbar vertebrate pain, iliosacral and hip pain, felt painful radiating spasms down my left and right legs, also jaw and teeth pain. Taking Naproxen and now ASA.  Very shakey and jittery. Occasionally have lower arm pain and numbness on left side. Also have injection site symptoms but minor compared to above. It&#39;s been 1 week and allergic part of rxn is over but concerned with possible neuro and bloodclot possibilties..  On day 2 or 3 I also had problems with my brain with reading comprahension.

Those lasted until Sunday at 09:00. It just abruptly stopped. I woke up with rash all over my face and itchy and swollen eyes on Saturday and I went to the eye doctor on Saturday. I was given eye drops and and an anti-histamine; That is helping. I am still a little bit itchy on my face but it&#39;s better.

We were 5 hrs from home, on a weekend, could not get vaccines in our county. Drove to  County. After the 15 min when walking out of the building noticed strong metallic taste in mouth (no fillings), thought odd. Then while driving noticed red blemishes/rash on neck, swelling of my tongue. Once arrived at hotel (too far to drive back home and not feeling well), noticed red rash on front of neck, ear lobes bright red, hot to the touch and swollen. Vertigo and low fever came on along with elevated heart rate. These lasted all Saturday into Sunday. Didn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t sleep Saturday night, Sunday morning rash on face with heart rate BPM elevated all day with fever and bad vertigo. All these symptoms continued all week with exception to the rash and swollen tongue those subsided late Sunday. The vertigo, fevers, skin sensitivity and complete fatigue along with bump at injection site persisted even to today.

                                                She got her vaccine, she felt the burning sensation all the way down to her fingers and her wrist.  I proceeded to go forward and wait the 15 minutes.  She then started to have pain in the side of her neck on the right side, discomfort and pain in her arm.  Within the hour she started to have headaches (has had COVID in the past).  She went home and it was a nagging pain in her arm, not at the site but the whole arm was sore and limited using the arm due to the discomfort.  That night is when she came on the news and started that the vaccine was being pulled from administration.  That night it was like a pulling sensation right in her upper arm, up near the armpit and the fatty tissue from the breast and where you raise your arm.  When she started noticing the discoloration started in her skin.  Her hands started getting black, under both arms were black, the back of her legs was black, and she started feeling worsening fatigue.  She started getting worried and was looking at how her veins turned purple blue/green just in the one arm.  She was trying to figure out why she had limited use of her arm, and was holding it as if she had a sling on it as when it hung to her side it had the pulling sensation and a crawling sensation in her veins (that night and going into the next day).  The next morning she was so exhausted and tired, as was her mother who had the vaccine at the same time, and was not feeling well.  She was feeling that possibly due to the fibromyalgia she was have worsening symptoms than her mother.  She then started bruises on her body, on the arm itself as if somebody grabbed and squeezed her arm, purplish/black bruising.  It had her forearm develop 3 large pockets of swollen, almost as if the medicine was sitting in her arm.   She was slowly getting the pulling sensation down to her hand, and she called the UC first and due to the high volume of COVID she wanted to know how long of a wait she would have.  They instructed her to go to the ER due to the development of the blood clots on the news.  There was no change in her symptoms, and got to the point that she could not move her arm, and the knots stayed in there and there was a reddish discoloration around them.  Now she was having a pulling sensation in her chest and palpitations of pain near her heart.  She was having soreness in her legs to the point that she was not able to walk, and felt it was in her nerves 3 days after the vaccine.  She stayed in the bed the entire week just due to the exhaustion and effects.   Every time she would go to reach for something she would have the pulling sensation down to her hand, and the entire arm was swollen with the bruising all over.  Her body started having purple and blue knots and also in the left leg.  Her arm and fingers were swollen as well.  She then started having itching of her arm, and her lips started swelling and got up and went to Hospital and was able to be seen.  She was having problems with her stomach as well, having a knot in the stomach where it was protruding and started loosing weight since the vaccine.    The ER doctor told her she had a reaction to the vaccine, and did a Doppler to see if she had blood clots.  They did not give her the results and didn&#39;t feel that she didn&#39;t have problems.  She also went to the UC and back and forth to the ER, and still had the knots and finally looked at the knots and her jaw was swollen, and her arm was still swollen.  The UC told her that she was having a fibromyalgia flare.  She is still having the same symptoms green/blue and have started protruding.   Due to the fatigue she has mainly just stayed in bed and knew that she was to have COVID symptoms, but knows that the crawling sensation and the knots sitting in her arm, and now her arm looks disfigured and the swelling is not going down.  They told her that the test was negative for the blood clots.  She had made an appointment with her neurologist and has an APT on Tuesday 5/25/21.   She continues to loose weight no matter how much she consumes and still continues to have the knots and pain in the arm.

On March 20, 2021 I woke up with swollen lips and face, and hives on my arms, legs and trunk. I also had a cough, watery eyes and itchy throat, like typical allergy symptoms. I went to the emergency room and was treated for an allergic reaction. No one, including myself, considered the COVID shot as the reason. The hives were gone within 24 hours, but the other allergy symptoms lasted for one week exactly. They had not gotten any better with a variety of over the counter allergy medications. When I  went to my primary doctor for a follow up visit on March 29th  all of the symptoms were gone. They were the ones that recommended I sign up with the vaers system, and they suggested the possible/likely connection to the vaccine.

The next day the sore throat was gone, and body aches got worse. All my joints ache. I felt chilled in spite of outdoor temperature of 79, and a hot bath, blankets and sitting in front of a fire. It was 74 inside the house. I started to get a bit of a headache but it never developed into a full headache. At about 6pm (day 2) I started to get  hot. Anything touching my skin bothered me.   At about 7pm (day 2) I took two Tylenol and the symptoms improved by about  8:30pm.

I went to sleep around 8:00.  I woke up around 10 pm unable to open my eyes all the way.  I believe they were swollen nearly shut.  I could see a slit of light coming in from outside.  I couldn&#39;t move my left hand at all (left arm is where I received vaccination).  I held it up to the outside light, and it was swollen.  The light coming in from outside hurt my eyes.  I couldn&#39;t see enough to call for help.  Around 1:30 a.m., the swelling went down enough for me to open my eyes.  I have never seen them look so bloodshot.  It was scary.  I could move my hand again as well.  I spent next day in bed resting.   Monday, I noticed a small rash on my right shoulder.  I went to work and was there about 20 minutes before I started feeling hot and dizzy.  I went home and spent the day in bed.   I was able to go to work the next day, Tuesday, without problem.  One week after vaccination, the rash on my shoulder went away, but a small rash broke out on my right shin.  This one was deeper.  One week later, there are just a couple of small scabs left in the spot on my shin.  I feel my energy level is close to normal.

                                                Received vaccine at 10am - 20 mins later felt slight prickly itching in both arms between armpit and elbow. Lasted about 10 minutes. Around 4pm the same day I had bad neck pain. And pounding heading, about 1 hour later starting getting chills and fatigued. By 10pm had body aches and muscles pains. I took some Motrin and went to bed. I couldn?t sleep as my mind kept racing. In the morning (day after vaccine) I was feeling worse. All symptoms continued in full force and I couldn?t get out of bed. 10am I was able to drink some Alka seltzer cold medicine and lay back down. I continued to have chills pounding headache bodyaches muscle aches and sweating, but no fever. I felt like I had a bad case of the flu. I?ve continued taking 600 mg Motrin every eight hours and this has helped with the pains and bodyaches. Day 3 woke up feeling much better, noticed a funny smell in my nose, I haven?t been blowing my nose or had any mucus, but I can?t explain the smell. I still have body aches and muscles pains.

She drank some water and then we took her blood pressure. she started to feel better and then felt a tighness in her neck. I retook her blood pressure and it was elevated. She then began having the chills, upon the last reading of blood pressure we call emergency services because it was elevated again. The last time we took her bp before emergency services came the reading was better. Ems checked her vitals and after a while let her decide whether or not she needed to go the hospital. She chose to leave and her son drove her home.

                                                Covid shots administered at airport for employees.  I received shot, and within a minute or two- my lips and tongue started to tingle, swell and go numb.  My throat started to swell too.  Had a hard time starting to breathe and took my xopenex inhaler.  I had taken a benadryl beforehand, and ended up taking two more as EMT came over to  help me there at the site.  She kept an eye on me.  My A Fib was speeding up and getting irregular too.  After about half an hour, it stopped getting worse and seemed to level off.  They offered to take me to ER, and had me promise to call 911 if it got bad again.  Still felt bad the rest of the day.  Felt a little better later the next day, and a little better (today is day 3), but still not 100%.  I did contact my doctor to check in

I headed home around 4 pm and started to feel warm, but thought it was the sun. Around 5:15 I got the chills, very bad. So bad my jaws were shaking. I tried to use a heating blanket to get warm, but was very miserable. About an hour later I started running a fever that kept going up. My ears started to hurt and the ringing was really bad. By 8:30 my fever had spiked to 102 and I was so nauseous I had a hard time moving around, I almost used the bathroom on myself twice. Started burning up but still unable to move, I went outside to cool down and had a family member take me to the urgent care. They said my arm was swollen from the injection site and that everything was normal and that it was a good thing I was having these experiences because it means the vaccine was working.  Gave me nausea medicine and aspirin and sent me home. I was unable to sleep from all the pain in my body and just laid here in pain starting to get really hot. Woke up around 4 soaking wet where I broke the fever and then continued to have a mild fever all day Sunday, April 11, with mild sweats on and off when my body would get too hot. Today just been trying to move around but very tired and exhausted. Had hard time sitting up to do some work at the table, so been laying down most of the day.

Within an hour the right side of my face and ear started to hurt, almost like it felt burnt, The nerve endings was super sensitive and has still not gone away. That night I didn&#39;t feel good, tired and out of it. On the third day I woke up with a rash on various parts of my body and moved to my eye lids as well. I called for a telehealth, and asked for a low dose steroid and he said not because I would &#34;disrupt my immune response&#34;.  I&#39;m still having issues.

I never take naps, but had very little energy and wound up needing to take a 3 hour nap on the day after the shot.  It is now the second day after vaccination, body aches have lessened, mild grade fever, no chills.

                                                on 3/24 I had a TIA with an intense heat pressure behind the right temple which resulted in complete numbness, heaviness, and tingling on my entire right side of the my body.  I was transported by ambulance to the hospital. A CT and MRI was done, no signs of blood clots or stroke.  I am still experiencing numbness and tingling in the right arm. Follow up appointments with the eye doctor indicate additional vision loss in the right eye with pressure behind the eye. I have a follow up appointment today with the neurologist for a brain scan and tomorrow for an eeg. My PCP, eye doctor, and neurologist believe it may be a blood flow issue. I have not had this type of event before.

These symptoms lasted without break for approximately 4 days/nights at which it tapered off.  Also, on the morning of Sunday 4/11/21 I  noticed a vein that seemed to &#39;inflate&#39; on my Left upper forehead and pulsed for a few minutes and then subsided with the feeling of a slight headache mostly on the Left side.

                                                Lady had vaccine, was told it was Janssen but lot # is Moderna.  She got the vaccine, the night of the vaccine around 5:30 she got a raging headache (she does get reactions to most vaccines).  She took Tylenol and her arm did hurt.  The next day she was still really hurting, her headache was really, really bad, and it stayed until Sunday.  Then on Sunday she was ok.  On Monday when she went to work and her right arm went limp, and while she was walking her right leg gave way and almost fell, grabbed hold and steadied herself.  The raging headache/migraine came back and she started getting nauseous, her lower back hurt, her upper neck area hurt like somebody was pounding her neck.  Then she got diarrhea and really really tired on Monday and Tuesday and also had loss of appetite.  Then yesterday 4/13/201 she just had the headache and a sound in her ear, went to UC and got drops for it.  Her temperature was 96.5, and her normal is 98.7, and was told that she was really cold.  Her PB was really high and the doctor took it again but it was not as high, attributed it to anxiety.  Last night the lower abdomen pain started, feeling like she was getting her period which she has not had in over a year.  She saw a little blood on her panty liner, and was thinking she was going to have a period, but the pain is excruciating in her lower abdomen.   She has also taken Tylenol off and on for her symptoms, and feels like she is cramping.     She is having hot/cold flashes as well, and has not had these issues from menopause.

I also had fatigue, headache, metallic taste in month and dizziness.  I felt awful.  I began to feel better after about 2 1/2 days.  I still have an occasional headache (not severe or constant), but it seems more allergy related (stuffy nose and drainage).  I would not take the vaccine again because I  thought my response was too strong.  I thought I would provide this information given the pause of the vaccine, so you could gather additional information/feedback.

I was getting scratchy throat, runny nose,  rash moved to stomach, my back (mainly in my shoulder blades) my upper arms; and my face was bright red -looked like it was peeling, and rash was on my scalp (in my hair). The inside of my lips were swelling and my eyelids were swelling  and I felt like I needed to cough. I called the doctor and she told me to go to ER - Thursday, the 15th. I did. They gave me: Epi shot - IV with Benadryl,  steroids, and Pepcid. I was there for about 3 hours. Everything worked with my reaction.  Epi -Pen prescription; More steroids, Benadryl and Pepcid and I have been taking this through today (today is my last day of the  steroids - I have two days of Benadryl left). My face is cleared up now, it&#39;s still super dry. I still have the rash all over my body. It looks like I rolled around in a fire ant hill.  I was told to carry the Epi-Pen with me for two weeks.

                                                The day after I received the vaccin I experienced an extreme tension in my two eyes that I still have now but not as intense. My left eye is the most affected - The blood flows really fast in the eye and it is pulsing. I don&#39;t have the sensation every day now but still on and off. Both of my eyes feel tension not as much as it was at the beginning but still experiencing symptoms of pressure and pulsions. It feels like I am going to have an ophthalmic migraine. My eyes doesn&#39;t feel right either. Overall, I felt weak, highlighted and it felt like if I was experiencing  feeling of &#34;dissociation&#34; - caused I think by my sight being affected.  I couldn&#39;t do a lot as my energy was very low and it felt that my oxygen wasn&#39;t at its maximum. Every small activity required a lot of energy and I could barely walk around my block. It affected my work and I couldn&#39;t teach at the end of that first week. I wasn&#39;t feeling good. I went to my doctor on Monday, April 12th as I was concerned about blood clot or other neurological and pulmonary issues. My Doctor examined me and listened to me and concluded that the sides effects were taking longer than the average to go away. The following day I woke up reading about the blood clots due to J&amp;J vaccin. I called back my doctor and we did a blood test. It came back negative and I got my eyes checked by my ophthalmologist too, and he didn&#39;t see anything.

                                                My thyroid numbers have been normal since removal, I test every 6 months with the same dr. My numbers where showing too much levothyroxine, so dr lowered my meds. Now I&#39;m hypo so he has increased. I have tingling in my right butt and hip area since the shot. My diverticulitis is worse. I sleep about 13  hours a night. I have fog brain, sores on my tongue, I have had thrush. I&#39;m always tired. Its hard for me to format words or sentences.

                                                Had shot on Monday.  Horrible pain in arm at injection site that went up my neck to my head.  Sinuses flared up and ears started beeping.  Became dizzy and nauseous and had difficultly breathing.  Went to pass out due to blood pressure drop.  Had to breath in alcohol wipes and then both arms went into pain as if falling asleep only 100 times worse.  Could not moves my arms - hands were cramping.  Took 1 hour to get back to some normal to drive home. The next day/Tues my sinuses where still a little swollen along with a little bit of arm pain, nausea and fatigue.   Wed - Fri sinuses continued to be swollen then on Fri - Sun had coughing.  Following Mon was weaker and feeling low immune.  Tues ended up at doctor&#39;s office having gone into a sinus infection.  Was also experiencing shallow breathing in neck and chest.  Started Augmentin 875mg 2 x a day Tues - Fri.  Then Fri night went into a severe inflammation in my chest, throat and esophagus with difficulty to catch my breath and couldn&#39;t eat.  Sat reached out to document through EMR and was prescribed a Steroid (6 days) which I started on Sun morning.  Was very weak and took that whole week with full does of steroid to get back to normal breathing.  Finished Antibiotics (12 days worth) 2 days after completing the steroid which was now Sunday.  Then still had some sinus recovery where ear was beeping in and out for 2 more days.  By Wed of the 4th week things were returning to normal.  Total time to recover was exactly 4 weeks.

I currently have depression, tinnitus, fatigue, brain fog, sometimes I feel shaky on the inside, swaying at times, and dizziness/vertigo. I sent follow-up information for my first VAERS report via mail and a pdf document to VAERS webpage; I attempted to fax several times but it came back unsuccessful; I left a message for a representative to return my call and nobody called back. I want to make sure you get this information, hence this second report.  Additional Follow-up Information: Hospital Emergency Room visit on April 8, 2021: purple finger, racing heart, chest pain. EKG, body scan for blood clots, and blood panel.  Doctor video visit on April 16, 2021: chest pain, feeling horrible, shortness of breath, metallic taste in the mouth, tinnitus, insomnia, anxiety, and depression.  Doctor office visit on April 29, 2021: headache, dizziness, fatigue, brain fog, stress, depression, thirsty, pressure at temples and back of head and forehead, rocking, anxiety.

Then yesterday  morning was a little achy and by afternoon was miserable the next day she got really tired, joints hurting and had to take a nap.  She cancelled one of her appointments  she&#39;s a home health nurse and went to sleep and when she woke up her throat was swollen, hurting, labored swallowing and when she would drink her ears would pop, and her tongue was swollen but could breathe fine, and then it progressed to where she could not swallow at all.  She took two Benadryl&#39;s and went to rest, and she was not able to move and had to have help getting dressed.   Her joints are swollen, her hands are swollen, but her throat is not hurting like she was yesterday.

I finally got the water and 800mg of ibuprofen went back to bed and slept until 11am, got up no headache but since then I have been experiencing hot flashes daily the rest of March and into April a few in May. I realize that I am of the age to experience hot flashes heading into menopause but this was to coincidental and I had never had hot flashes before.

                                                Later that day I had the worse headache ever. It was the number 2 worst headache I&#39;ve ever experienced. The headache lasted about a week and a half but it wasn&#39;t as intense as it was initially. It gradually got lessened but it was constant and persistent. I had a pain and pressure at my fore head and my eyes hurt as in the muscle of my eye. I also had pain in the injection site with  muscle soreness but that went away quickly. The itchiness was different than other vaccines and lasted for about a day. I also started to get congestion in my sinuses and my ears. I also experienced pain when trying to swallow. That lasted about 3 days. It felt like my glands were swollen. The combination of the headache and the ear pain and sinus pressure made me unable to work. Up until that point I was taking ibuprofen to manage the pain and maybe 1 or 2 doses of Benadryll which is what I usually take when I get allergy symptoms like itchy throat. It did not work, I contacted the doctor who said I had a sinus infection. I went to the doctor on 04/22/2021 and received antibiotics (amoxicillin) which lasted 10 days. Around this time, I developed a cough which is still present. The antibiotics did not help, the doctor then gave me steroids on 5/12/2021. They do not seem to be helping. I also took Aleve sinus medicine as well. The cough worsened and I lost my voice around 05/12/2021. My doctor said it was drainage that was causing my cough.

                                                My ears haven?t stopped ringing since I got the vaccine. It?s the first noise I hear in the morning it?s the last noise I hear before I fall asleep and every waking moment between, it?s maddening.  I can?t take it.  It?s anxiety causing and so disruptive I can barely concentrate or sleep, it?s louder than every ambient noise.  While the vac may or perhaps not be the cause, getting the J&amp;J vaccine is the only thing in this timeline that I can pin point.  There have been no other changes in my life that would indicate it came from anywhere else.  What can I do to make it stop.  I can?t imagine living the next 40 years of my life this way, it?s unbearable.  Had I known this may have been a side effect I never would have done it. I lived through the peak of Covid but I don?t know how I?ll live productively with  this plaguing ringing in my ears.  Please suggest a remedy, if you know of one.  Signed, terribly regretful.

Woke up and was real sick for many days. On May 12th I tested positive for covid. My experience has been different than others I know who had it. Most food tasted rotten or like chemicals or medicine. Lost 20 lbs. Still have little energy. Foggy headed as I forget things easily. And other things.

                                                I am experiencing severe head and ear pressure. Came on two days after my vaccine and has not gone away.  Went to doctor and they said my ears were both inflamed and the right ear had fluid behind it. So I have been put on ear drops and Allegra D. (Said maybe allergies for the head pain). Took ibuprofen as well 600 mg 3 times a day for 4 days with no relief.  I am on Day 4 of the ear drops with not much relief for my head pressure. Ears have slightly improved but the head pressure is still intense.  At this point I am 13 days out since my vaccine.   Also have arm pain in both limbs. Near the biceps pain comes and goes. This has been since day 1 of vaccine.  I believe all this is related to the J and J vaccine.

                                                I had an auto-immune flare up starting the day after the vaccine. I took care of myself. Then over the course of the next couple of weeks. I had on and off headaches. My thyroid then in April 2021 - it swelled (I had another auto-immune flare up). My neck gets really thick feeling and kind of swollen. In May, on and off, I had symptoms of my legs falling asleep more often. My vision has gotten worse in the last three months. It is a little more blurry. I had a lot of breast tenderness happen. I went for a mammogram. My anxiety and depression is off the charts and I&#39;m able to manage things pretty well usually. I talked to someone this morning and a therapist, too. Thinking what to do given insurance.  I had been discounting the symptoms because I was not thinking it was vaccine. It has increased a lot in the last three months, though, all the doctoring and symptoms I have had. I&#39;ve felt out of whack; exhausted a lot and have put on a lot of weight. It&#39;s still all happening.

                                                Starting about 1-2 weeks after the vaccine, I had increased pain throughout your body (above and beyond my baseline).  The pain was in my hands, fingers and shoulders. I also had a radiating pain in both legs on the back but more so on the left leg. I took my prescribed medication which did not alleviate the pain. I went to see the doctor and was given a steroid shot in the lumbar region which help alleviate the pain but I still have pain in the back of my legs and I am having trouble sleeping because the pain will wake me up at night. I was prescribed hydrocodone to add to my medication regimen. Currently I am having tinnitus, dizziness, brain fog, fatigue, change in my taste and phantom smell.

I typically get a single cold sore when I am on the verge of having a cold or flu, but not three at once. I also experienced pain in my left armpit (assuming lymph nodes) for two days post-vaccine.

No treatments yet....but if still bad after this weekend, will seek medical help.  Left eye swelling started at 2pm today, with pain. the eye lid and the area around the left eye are painful and swollen. I have been using hot compresses.  Difficulty catching my breath today durning a morning walk. I have been walking for months on the same path and can hold a conversation, but today, I could barely walk and talk. Once I stopped talking I eventually was able to catch my breath, but we had to walk a much slower pace as well.

                                                I had the vaccine at approximately 7:35 AM and by 1:30 PM I was not running a temperature, however, it felt like my insides were going to burn as my core felt like it was on fire. I still feel like more core is on fire, but it has subsided and is less concerning as it was on Friday, 3/26/2021, and Saturday, 3/27/2021  My eyes became sensitive to light on Friday, 3/26/2021 night and my eyes are still sensitive especially to artificial lighting. Natural light hurts as well but is more tolerable.  My heart rate definitely increased Friday, 3/26/2021 through Saturday, 3/27/2021 however I did not experience the other symptoms on the critical list (such as inability to breathe) therefore did not go to the hospital.  I suffered from muscle weakness on Friday, 3/262021, and Saturday, 3/27/2021. The muscle weakness was only in my legs.

                                                Very painful injection! I felt this going in immediately. Probably 30 minutes after I also felt a little dizzy but I also have a chronic condition called vestibular migraine. I was fatigued later in the evening. Had full day on day after vax  because I already had things on my calendar but was dragging by the time I got home. Aches all over especially joints, head and injection site was warm to touch and somewhat swollen. Also started running fever one day after. Highest temp 101.9 . I also started having diarrhea, full on three days after. My taste and smell had been off since having covid in august, but I swear they are since taking vax. Today is Tuesday so I&#39;m now five days in and temps normal today. My body aches are also improved but my head is still a bit achy.

                                                4/6/21 I awoke with symptoms of numbness/paralysis on left side of face limited to  upper lip and cheek area and both eyes would not stop watering. Movements to drink or make facial expressions were limited due to the numbness.  Because I have sensitive skin  I thought I may have had some type of reaction to something. So I waited to see if it would clear up through the day. I was not experiencing any other symptoms. By that evening it was apparent that I was not getting better and possibly getting worse because I began to experience some noticeable drooping in my cheek area. I decided to call my doctor in the morning. Because I am currently out of town, my home doctor suggested I see a local ER to rule out a stroke and determine if I was experiencing Bell&#39;s Palsy. I went to an ER clinic on 4/7/21

She said she is not feeling well, and her eye was rolling (as if when she tried to look up and couldn&#39;t get their eye to remain open) a for about few seconds and then she her eye was open back to normal.  She was sweating on both hands and face were cold to the touch.  I got the manager from the store to help me lie patient flat on the floor&#39;s surface gently to prevent her from falling off the chair.    Based on this our adverse event protocol, patient exhibited similar symptoms to Syncope (paleness, sweating, coldness of extremities), so I patient is lying flat on the floor, feet elevated, and cold compression was apply on her arms and face.  Unfortunately, patient conditions was not improving as it seem but she was alert and able to breath (fast pace) the whole entire time the incident occurred where she answer all questions when we myself, then the paramedics asked her questions.  Paramedic arrived at scene within 10 minutes after individual got off the phone with 911.  They took her away around 9 am and said patient probably experience anxiety attack.

                                                My tongue swelled up about 6 hours after the vaccine was administered.  I went out to eat and had steak and when I returned home I noticed my tongue felt weird and was sitting on my teeth.  It took about 1 1/2 hours to go down but it did so I didn&#39;t end up going to the emergency room.   My tongue was soar for the next few days because it was like I had bit it on both sides where it went over my teeth.

                                                The first night I got the vaccine, and I had a fever of 103 degrees for about six hours and 101 degrees at the 24 hours. I had all over body aches for two days but my hands still ache after tree weeks. I woke up in the morning an noticed a big bulging blue vein in my right eyelid right above the outer part of my eye. One week later my thumb started to throb and then a big bulging blue vein in my left thumb. It felt like it had been injured but it looked better within hours. I called my doctor and he advised that I go to the ER. I also had trouble with my head throbbing for a week after the shot.  My eye was painful and lasted a little over a week and my eyes were a little blurry. Both problems have resolved but I still have an ache in my hands after three and a half weeks. It is a deep bone ache which makes it difficult to work with my hands.

Had severe headache from the left ear to the right ear and going up around my forehead, as if my head was in a vise - all day. Heart was racing all day and night, couldn&#39;t sleep on my side because of it. around 24 hours after the shot I felt chest heaviness, which went away after a few minutes. Face was flushed, and I felt clammy. Went to the bathroom more than normal.  Aches  and joint pain, which weren&#39;t too bad. When I woke up the next day, symptoms were gone, except my arm was still sore and had slight fatigue.

                                                I received the shot on a Friday on my lunch hour and had arm pain for about an hour.  That night started developing some tiredness and body aches and a slight fever.  Saturday I could not get out of bed.  Chills, muscle aches and fever, ran a fever so high 104 plus I was delirious and could not get warm.  Sunday fever was down to 101.  Monday had a full blown head cold that lasted for 24 hrs.  About 2 weeks later I developed this right ear ringing.  It never stops and it is getting louder.  24 hours a day.

                                                Immediate reaction in right arm-it felt like my arm was on fire. The pharmacist gave the shot extremely high-almost in the shoulder and the reaction was intensely painful.   Starting about 6 days later, the soreness of the shot developed into not being able to raise that arm at all without pain.  Now, a month later, the pain is worse and is waking me up at night. The injection site is not sore, but the arm itself is not functional without pain. About 2 weeks after the shot, I started having a fuzzy feeling in my head (not painful) and ears.  I am extremely sensitive to sound and feel almost dizzy at times. My speech has been slurred and words are not coming to me easily. I am extremely tired and feel foggy.

Called the doctor and was prescribed antibiotics right away. Was told to also apply hot towels to side of face and gargle with salt water till the infection drained.  If it didn&#39;t drain, was instructed to go to the hospital. It mostly drained within 2 hours of hot towels and salt water gargle. It was mostly blood and some fluid that drained out. 24 hours later, it was gone. Finished the antibiotics completely as instructed by doctor.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA The morning after the vaccine was administered, I awoke with a scratchy throat,  itchy eyes and feeling very tired.   Throughout the morning,  the fatigue increased and I felt flushed in my face, but chilled in my arms and body.  I went home at noon and  found I had developed a fever of 100.9, which eventually increased to 101.3 later that afternoon.  I felt joint pain and general malaise.   Two days after the vaccine, the fever had broken and the joint pain was better. I still have fatigue, but it is improving throughout the day.

Then as that passed, my throat began to itch and inside my ears became itchy, then after about 5 minutes or so my tongue started to tingle on the front end and felt thicker at the back. After a total of 20 minutes or so after this started I was home and took a Benadryl, which helped, however after a few hours my face started itching, no rash just an itch and it is still itching after 5 days. It seems to be getting better every day.  It was definitely a similar type of reaction I get from raw pitted fruits.

After some time I felt like the lower part of my face went numb and it took tremendous effort to move my lips to talk.  At that point, the medical called the ambulance and sent me to ER, where I was under supervision for some time. I was very weak and nauseated. After I was released, I was very weak could not keep the vertical position.  The next day I was very nauseated, with awful tinnitus, lightheadedness, and weakness. Staying vertical for more than 15 minutes brought fainting symptoms.  I was not able to get out of the house to work.  The next day the fainting symptoms disappeared, everything else continued. Too weak to go to work.  I started moving about only on the 4th day after the shot.  During this event, I did not have any fever or muscle ache, no virus0tyle symptoms.

Later on she started to have fever, cough, and then headache.  She then went to bed and slept 7-8 hours, all day long.  The swelling stayed for almost a week in her arm.  Then approximately 4-5 days later on 3/21/21 the right side of her face, the lower part of her ear to the lower part of her face started swelling, and her lip was numb.  Fearing she had Bell&#39;s palsy which she had about 10 years ago she went to see her doctor and the doctor said that it was a reaction from the vaccine.  The right side of her face and the swelling is almost gone, but her face is still feeling numb.   Her doctor did not give her anything, and since her swelling was almost gone and was improving he didn&#39;t want to give her anything for it.  He told her to watch it and if it worsens to get back to him, and to report to VAERS.

                                                It wasnt until around 11pm that I started feeling bad. I was getting hot, confused a little uncomfortable or agitated, then I went to bed. I woke in the middle of the night in a crying fit because I thought I was going to die I felt soooo bad ! It was worse than any flu Id ever had! My joints hurt, my head wanted to explode , fever of 101.3 , breathing issues , exhaustion, thirsty...this lasted 2 to 3 days. Ive had a couple of days here in beginning of april til now of waking up feeling sick again. It doesnt last all day. Sometimes it just before bedtime. I guess I just feel a bit sick, but that could also be the cancer that ive had since july 2020 that hasnt been treated by a health care system I have?

                                                Three waves of discomfort... felt like ice water was poured inside of my body.  Extreme  weaknesses of arms/legs.  Visual issues.  First wave within 60 seconds of shot (ended up on floor - embarrassing!).  Second, and most severe, wave about 10 minutes later while sitting in chair.  Apparently, I passed out with my eyes open.  Hubby got nurse.  They said I was unresponsive.  Nurse checked blood pressure and heart rate after second wave - both normal.  Third wave, much less severe, hit after 10 more minutes.  Ice water/weakness feeling in arms and legs and not so much in chest area.  Nurse speculated it could be low blood sugar (based on medications).  Have never had low blood sugar event previously AND had eaten about an hour prior to vaccination.  However, drank 4 ounces of orange juice, just in case.  Went home about 20 minutes later... no other significant side effects.  No swelling/redness at injection site.  No other illnesses, etc.

Her blood pressure dropped to 78/80, heart rate was 45 bpm.  She was unconscious for approximately one minute and 30 seconds.  911 was called immediately and she was transported to medical center. When I called the patient today, she did say that she was feeling better.  She mostly felt nauseous and dizzy following her vaccination.  She reports that her arm still feel itchy and that she has been taking Benedry

I slept all afternoon; felt tired. When I got ready to go the bed, my heart felt like it was racing some. Around 2:00 am my heart was really pounding - my watch was going off and telling me that it was at 130 to 150. The highest was 152. I called my doctor&#39;s after hours phone number. I took my blood pressure - it wasn&#39;t that elevated but it was the racing heartbeat. About 03:30, I went back to sleep. It was about 100 for about next  12-18 hours. It seems to be back to normal now.

                                                Within 5 minutes of receiving the vaccine my hearing got muffled and my ears began to ring loudly.  For 5 days my ears were ringing so loudly that I could not focus on anything but the ringing. I had trouble hearing and sought medical help. My primary care doctor put me on a five day dose of prednisone. He found no physical reason for the ringing. The prednisone has made it so that the ringing is not the most prominent thing I hear but it is still there and loud.  I will be seeking the help of an audiologist. This week.

I visited Dr. and he has ordered tests to check on my heart. I told him I was concerned about the &#34;pause&#34; and the reason for pause because I feel pretty miserable, and he added a CT test that will be done in two to three weeks. I do not know if he will report my symptoms as possibly vaccine related.

                                                I woke up on Saturday 3/13 and noticed that my vision on my left eye was very fuzzy and stayed that way for a few days. I made an appointment to see my optometrist on Wednesday 3/18 and he referred me to a retina specialist Dr. I saw Dr on Friday 3/19. He ran tests and diagnosed me with branch retinal vein occlusion in my left eye. This is typically caused by a blood clot in the eye. The occlusion caused swelling in my retina and macula which caused my vision loss. I was treated with an injection of Eylea (anti-VEGF) to reduce the swelling on my retina/macula. I will need to have these injections every 4 weeks to maintain my sight.

                                                Had migraines (frontal lobe with flashing lights-distorted vision and difficult to hold my eyes open) from 3/20-3/24. (one week after vaccine) I do not get headaches, so this was very strange. On 3/23, I woke up with a bright red Left thumb- it looked and felt like a sunburn.  The next day (3/24), it was still bright red (fire engine red), swollen, hot to the touch and had a blister in my webspace.   I went to the dr 3/23 pm who was not sure what was going on, but prescribed an antibiotic (Keflex). This reduced my pain and swelling. Today it is still red and is now flaky, but not swollen or hot to the touch.   The main thing was the migraines as I do not get headaches.   I&#39;m not sure if that or the skin thing is related, but thought I should throw this information your way in case there have been others with similar symptoms.

I have  had a headache since the injection, and started getting chills and fevers on April 8 and has continued.  I have been extremely tired since April 9....it is interfering with my work.

                                                I received the vaccine 3/12 around 3:00 p.m.  On 3/13 around 4:00 a.m., I woke up with a sharp, localized pain in my right, lateral thigh area.  Within a 15 minute period of time the localized pain moved down my thigh, past my outer knee area, and to my calf.  After approximately 15 minutes the sharpness of the pain subsided.  As far as I know I have had no lasting side effects from this.  I have CRPS/RSD in that leg, specifically in that region, so at the time and with the fever I had, I didn&#39;t think too much of this.  REACTION AFTER VACCINE INJECTION:  As an aside, I had some unusual reactions to the vaccine immediately after the injections.  Within 5 minutes of getting the vaccine, I developed numbness in my lips, tongue, and palate and a &#39;lump&#39; in my throat that made it hard to swallow.  It took approximately 2 hours fpr these reactions to resolve.  I have had these reactions before when I accidentally ingested sugar substitutes.  Also, at approximately 15 minutes post injection, both my ears felt internal pressure (as if I had submerged in deep water) and I could not hear well.  I have never had this reaction before.  This took about 1 hour to resolve leaving me with a moderate headache for 3 days.

                                                I have had symptoms for three weeks and seen Dr. this week. I have made a report about this information. Last night my eye became sore and quickly progressed getting red, swollen, and gunky. It was around midnight so I visited the ER to be sure nothing serious would result. This eye infection caused pain in my eyeball, behind my eye, my headache to worsen, and an earache. I was subscribed an ointment.

Took an alleve which helped but the headache did not go away. 4/7-4/12  bad headache exacerbated by  going outdoors in sunlight. persistent grogginess every  morning. very difficult to wake up. I  run several days a week was able to  complete 4 miles no problem .  but headaches would be worse being outside in daylight. 4/13 I read news of headaches and  clotting rx  so I saw my Dr.  did blood work and scheduled for MRI.  blood work /platelets came back WNL . MRI was cost prohibitive for me so I cancelled MRI would follow up with MRI if headaches worsened and or developed other symptoms. 4/13-4/21 Persistent , annoying headache but improving somewhat. Still have difficulty waking up in the am. 4/22 First day that headache mostly was not present. Difficulty waking up in the am still.  4/17

                                                4/5/2021--Received Janssen vaccine.  Felt very hot during the day.   4/6/2021--Woke up with very bad headache and rash on the injected arm plus on my stomach.  Went for a walk and felt pain in my left calf and achilles tendon.  Went to work.  4/7/2021--Started my work day as a Personal Trainer/Fitness Instructor at 6am as usual.  Taught cycling classes and trained a few clients.  Went for walk.  Still had a headache.  When I got in my car to head home, my vision was super blurry and I felt very dizzy.  I ate an orange and peanuts and hydrated more.  I was not even sure I could drive home.  I got home told my family how I was feeling.  My husband noticed my eyes were very red and swollen.  I took a shower, drank a smoothie and ate a salad.  Used my aunt&#39;s BP cuff to check my BP and it was 148/99.  I have NEVER had HBP.    4/8/21--Woke up feeling disoriented as if the left side of my face, body were off--neurological stuff.  I went to reach for grapes in the refrigerator and could not grab them.  I felt like I have never felt before and ask my husband to drive me to the ER.  While at the waiting room at the ER, I felt chest tightness and pain and nauseous.  My BP was 153/111.  Again, I have never been diagnosed or been treated for hypertension.  They did EKG, lab tests, chest X-ray.  Once my BP came down, they sent me home.   This is before all the JJ Janssen vaccine &#34;news&#34; came out and the reasons it was paused.  I developed a very bad cough about two hours after I got home from the ER.  4/9/11--Made appointment with a brand new primary care doctor.  Saw her on Monday 4/12/2021 as recommended by ER.  I had never met her before.  She prescribed a very low dose of BP medication, which I did not take because the number one side-effect is dry-cough.  I was already coughing a lot, later on with blood.  4/11/2021--Still feeling pretty bad, I woke up to the news of the Janssen vaccine being paused.  Frankly, I felt relieved that I was not going crazy.  This truly has been one of the hardest things I have ever gone (and still am) going through.  I became concerned about the pain in the left calf and heel could be a clot.   Called primary care doctor.  Had ultrasound of legs and chest x-ray the following day   4/12/2021--Had persistent cough with blood.  Went to ER at 9pm.  Had EKG, blood work, CT without contrast of chest, covid test--negative.  Got home around 2am.  4/19/21--Followed up with primary care doctor who after explaining to her I am extremely fatigued, still blurry vision, dizzy, cough better but not gone, chest discomfort on the left side, she referred me to an ophtamologist and cardiologist.  My insurance and this poorly established referral system is very difficult to navigate.  Up to now I am still waiting for the referral and pre-aurhtorization to the opthtamologist.  (4/23/2021).  I want to say, I am pretty healthy. I have worked in fitness and wellness for over 30 years. I have never drank alcohol, smoked or done any drugs.  Prior to this no physician has told me I have HBP or any issues for which I have to be medicated.  I take zero medications.  Even when I had the bad headache from the vaccine I took nothing.  I have not worked in two weeks and had not driven until last saturday.  If I don&#39;t work, I don&#39;t get paid.   I pay for almost $600/month for my insurance in the marketplace.  This has been another stressor of this storm.  Getting providers to really listen and insurance companies to take situations like this seriously.   I could not drive at night.  This has been rough and I look forward to being myself soon.  This reaction felt like a heart attack/stroke with extreme fatigue, acid reflux, cough with some blood, muscular pain.  The rash and headaches were the least of my concerns.  I am not yet recovered from all of this.  I sure hope there is no permanent damage and that this too shall pass.  It is important to note that I have tried reporting this event several times to the VAERS website online.  I completed the 4-5 pages multiple times and it would not let me submit.  I also called the VAERS 1-800 number to report and they told me to go back to the online form.  I left several messages when I could not get it done online and to this date no one has called me back.  I called to report my adverse reaction and they told me they do not take that info.  I also called the health dept.  After several phone calls to them a nurse called me back but did not take a formal report.  When someone is feeling pretty sick, this is a lot to ask of.  I persisted because I feel this is important to be reported.

My throat and tongue and soft palate were covered in blisters. They were very painful and it was hard to swallow. She recommended seeing my dentist. They both thought it was a viral infection. I was prescribed a mouth rinse Chlorohexidine and recommended combination of Mylanta and Benadryl.  After almost two weeks I just have one blister left on the side of my tongue but the rest are healed up. I have no more pain.

The following day slight headache, weakness, not feeling good.  On the evening of 4/15, it hurt to breathe and I had a burning sensation on my rib cage going to my back. I thought I could handle it until Monday to see my Dr.  but by the time I went to the ER it hurt to walk, talk, breathe and the burning sensation would not go away.  I went to the ER on 4/17 he said I had a collapsed lung, gave me something for pain via IV.  Did an EKG, Chest X-Ray, CT Scan, and Lab work. He let me go and said to take deep breaths every hour on the hour and to drink lots of water.  I got in to see my regular Dr. on 4/22 and he said I had an allergic reaction to the vaccine.  He gave me Gabapentin 100 mg 3 times a day and Tramadol q 6 hours for pain.  I called him back because I still have the pain and now I am taking 300 mg Gabapentin in the am and 300 in the pm.  It is still not working.  I am constantly hurting the burning sensation on my rib cage and goes back to my back, it hurts to breathe, walk, talk, drive, I have blurred vision , dizziness and weakness.  I have an appointment with Dr.   again tomorrow.

                                                Early in the morning I started developing a headache.  I typically have migraines and thought this was just what I was getting.  I took Excedrin Migraine to try to keep it from getting worse, but it continued to get worse and worse and worse.  About noon I found that I could not stand any light or sound - this is not typical for me as I can usually listen to things during a headache even if I can&#39;t open my eyes.  I ended up spending all the rest of the day and the night alone in a dark noiseless room.  I told my husband it was the worse headache I had ever had.  It was only later that we found out the shot caused blood clots in the head.  I did not correlate the two because it had been so long - almost 3 weeks - since my vaccination.

I noticed it the night after the shot as it made it very difficult to sleep. There is never a day without the ringing, like Tinnitus. Some days it&#39;s an 8 (1-10) and others it&#39;s a 3. I have talked to my doctor on a video visit and will be seeing him in person on 5/24/21.

                                                On April 4th, I woke up in the morning with a severe headache, nauseated, and chilly. Those symptoms lasted about 8-10 hours. I was having horrible neck and back pain that I couldn?t lift my head or neck the pain went down right shoulder into arm, hand, and fingers (pointer, ring, middle - tips of fingers were numb). Three days after that I started experiencing tongue, mouth, and lips numbness. They were numb and then the numbness just faded away. By Thursday of that week the NP in my office where I work ordered me a round of steroids and muscles relaxers, but it did nothing. I went and saw my PCP  around mid-April for right arm and shoulder aching and he ordered an X-ray and Physical Therapy. He ordered the x-ray to rule out presumed pinched nerve. I am currently doing the Physical Therapy. I still experience pain it?s getting better but still not 100%.

I wasn&#39;t able to hold my grandbaby because I just felt very weak. As time went on I had a very bad cough that I couldn&#39;t get rid of. I went to the hospital and I also experienced a sharp pain in my body. I was prescribed some medication to prevent the coughing, this helped some. A couple days later, I couldn&#39;t keep up anything I ate. My coughing was very painful , and was told I probably caught a cold. I was diagnosed with acute hypoglycemia. The hospital also did call to check up on me after. I am just now getting rid of the cough which was around June 9, 2021. The fatigueness has not gone away.

The evidence was not noted on the previous visit. I am not sure if it has anything to do with the vaccine. I developed a rash on 06/02/2021. It started on my elbow and then it moved to my thighs and it is mostly on my arms and legs. It has been there for 10 days so far. It has spread and it is red little bumps like a skin irritation and it is itchy. I have not taken any new medication recently.  I am planning on seeing a doctor for the rash.

I contacted my doctor April 29th and he prescribed over the counter Mecilizine, which I took but it did not help with the vertigo. I made an appointment to see an MD, as my MD was out of the office, on Monday May 3rd. He prescribed Fluticasone, sinus rinse, and mucinex.  I took these for 7 days with no relief from the dizziness or hearing loss.  I contacted my MD again and he scheduled a hearing test which showed Moderate hearing loss in right ear.

The noise actually woke me up out of my sleep.  I have to sleep with a sound machine and the sound machine is no longer masking the noise.  It has been about 10 days and the intensity level has not abated.

I took benadryl as soon as I felt tongue swelling , but it did not stop the advancement of more swelling in my tongue. Eventually I got throbbing jaw pain from the pressure of my tongue.

                                                patient stayed for 15 minutes after the shot and then left. She said she tasted metallic and tingle in lips/mouth so she drove back to the store and came inside. We gave her 50mg diphenhydramine PO. She had BP of 178/96 and pulse 107.  She seemed to calm down but we had already called paramedics. They arrived and she became frantic and asked for EpiPen. They monitored her EKG and asked her many questions. She demanded to go to the ER so they put her on a stretcher and left.  Her pulse did get up to 150 when she was most frantic however her oxygen saturation stayed 100% through entire time. She was instructed to slow her breathing and remain calm.

She stated that the facial symptoms started mid morning today on 4/5/21.  Last week ( week of 3/28 to 4/3) she reports that she felt &#34;weird&#34;.  She felt as if there were cool water running under her skin at all times.  She also states that when anything touches her skin, it feels very cold.  For example, when running her hands under warm water, it feels like ice water on her hands.  When setting her bare arms on her desk, it feels as if they are being set on ice and when her pants rub against her legs it feels as if they are wet and cold.  She also stated that the top 1/3 of her back was tingly and felt as if she had applied Biofreeze to it, but she had put nothing on her back.  Her tip of her tongue feels as if it is &#34;burnt&#34; and she can not tasted anything on the front part of her tongue.  She needs to get things way in the back of her mouth before she can taste them. On 4/3/21 she states that her lips began tingling as if they were having numbing medication wearing off from a dental visit, but she had done nothing different.  On 3/31 her lower back also felt as if it had a pinched nerve.  Today on 4/5/21 she has the Bell&#39;s Palsy on her face that started mid morning and she complains of her nose feeling tingly also.  She also feels as if she is retaining fluid.

Day three - Tired after walking the dog, napped and then tightness/ache in chest/lung area which continued throughout the night. I could not lie on my side or it would trigger the ache in my chest. I could breathe deeply but that also triggered the tightness. Day four (Monday) - Chest ache continued. Contacted doctor&#39;s office. Took a Tylenol that seemed to help a little and watching my blood pressure.

EMS took blood pressure it was 93/50 hear rate was very low. Called ambulance and advised I go to hospital immediately.  Blood pressured jumped to 150 then dropped again.  Once in ambulance they put IV in and gave Zofran through IV, I don&#39;t know if they put anything else in there.  Blood pressure stabilized around 110 which is normal for me, I normally have low blood pressure and heart rate.  Nausea and dizziness dissipated by the time I got to hospital.  They put EKG on also while I was in ambulance and said I was having PVC&#39;s advised dr to do another EKG once I got to hospital.  Felt better by about 5:00 PM.  Overnight I had slight fever and body aches, took Advil and symptoms subsided.  Slight soreness in arm and armpit, but not major.  Have been feeling fine now other than being traumatized by the whole event.

                                                General swelling in the armpit under the shoulder that received the injection. It&#39;s sore, and making my arm lightly achy and my hand tingle off and on. I assume it is due to the lymp nodes being super-activated under there. I have had Covid-19 twice (May 2020 and Jan 2021) and guess it may be related to a super-ready immune system. Also, it has re-activated some of the covid symptoms--chills, exhaustion, headache, and a dimming of my taste and smell, which had not even fully returned since the January 20021 bout of Covid. Now I can only discern sweet/sour/salty, with a momentary hint of what I&#39;m eating during the first bite or sip, before it&#39;s gone again. Complex mixes of foods, like a taco, for instance, would taste like nothing at all. Zero. Single note flavors, such as orange juice, are weakly flavored at first, then gone after a taste or two, like the tastebuds are used up. Most of the ability to smell is weak again, as well. I do wonder if the losses are due to inflammation response and not the virus activity itself, in light of this?none

I also experienced tinnitus about two hours after the shot that is continuing to today.  Related to the autoimmune flare that I believe is related to the vaccine, I first began experiencing bone/joint pain in my wrist (never had this before) and then over the days this has progressed to significant symptoms of flare of autoimmune today.  Pain/ache in all joints now, muscle pain as well, along with vision blurriness at times, fatigue and autoimmune rash on my hands and in my groin.

Dr said I&#39;m having an inflammatory response to vaccine and they have referred me to a rheumatologist (gave me a referral) - joint pain and itching hasn&#39;t gone away at all. (The really bad rash on my neck, upper chest and torso and back on day three - that rash is gone but that tingling and itching of having the rash hasn&#39;t  gone away.) I&#39;m working still but I&#39;m working from home - so that has been okay - although some days I feel worse then others.  I noticed yesterday that my breasts were swollen/lumpiness. Was born with fiber cystic breasts - since menopause that has gotten better but now this feels like it did back then - feels like it did when I was going to start my period. I haven&#39;t had a period since five years ago. Eye sensitivity: Normally have dry eyes but it&#39;s worsened. I have to put drops in multiple times of day. I literally wake up in the middle of the night with almost a sandpaper feeling in my eyes and have to put drops on them. I have been doing acupuncture - it will be my third time today - it helps with stress and the anxiety from these symptoms.  They wanted me to take steroids - I&#39;m trying not to do something like this because I am so sensitive to these types of things.

                                                I had a tingling from head to toe within five minutes of the vaccine. I woke at 3am with a metallic taste in my mouth. Twelve hours after the vaccine I had fever, chills, joint pain, muscle pain. It was like a really bad Fibromyalgia flare up. I took some Tylenol which helped with the pain. In the morning the fever was 100.4 and I had chills. I had a really bad headache which was a five out of ten and I was trying to stay hydrated. I had a dry tickling cough which was just one cough that I couldn&#39;t control. It also didn&#39;t feel like I could get enough air. I have had a dry cough when I take a deep breath or when talking. I couldn&#39;t even talk without having that uncontrollable cough. I started to take NAC six weeks after the shot because a friend said that it helped her. I started taking that and it really improved my symptoms within two weeks. I have history of surviving wildfire smoke. The cough seems to be under control at the moment.

                                                Began experiencing throbbing  pain about 15 min after the injection that radiated down the entirety  of the arm along with a headache and tunnel vision. The headache dissipated about 4 hours later  and the tunnel vision dissipated about  30 min later. The pain and throbbing  the arm lessen but the days to follow I did notice a loss of strength to my forearm as with as the tricep and bicep although there was no swelling on the injection site.  The days to follow I applied heat, cbc, to try and heal alleviate the discomfort but have yet to fully gain the strength back in my arm. Some days are worse then others.  About 2 weeks after the injection I began experiencing  SOB and pain around my upper (r) ribcage, and shoulder.

                                                So I had the injection on 4/2 by the middle of the night I ended up having a high fever of 102, the headache - it started as a headache not a typical type, the body ache and nausea which came with the fever. When you have flu symptoms you feel crampy and weak and that was typical. I started to feel back to myself by the 9th of April. I couldn&#39;t workout, I was very weak, it almost felt like I had mono. On the 13th I started with the severe headache, almost migraine because different noises and light and the sensitivity, it was very uncomfortable to have my glasses on my face because of the pressure. I also started to tremble a lot, weakness muscle trembling like if I picked up a glass my whole body was shanking and it was very noticeable.   I didn&#39;t know if I picked up Covid from being in the hospital even though I was double masked. I had a covid test and it came out negative and gave it to my Doctor and she advised I got to the Hospital because something was going on. On the 16-17 I was admitted to the hospital and they ran a bunch of tests. I had even though I was in the hospital I continued to be sick with these headaches all the way up to May 15th.  This is something I have never experience these continuous migraines, it was a long haul. The headaches have now tapered off and the trembling have gotten a little better, when I workout the muscles aren&#39;t as weak and trembling. When I go on my toes I still have a  little shaking, especially on my left side but it&#39;s not as severe as it was.

One other thing that happened that may not be related is that my secondary implant eye socket became very sore and swelled up.  It could of been for another reason but the timing was uncanny.  I am feeling fine now and none of my reactions were that troubling.  I have experienced about 3 times a sudden feeling in my  body that made me think I wonder if that was the vaccine but I am feeling great now and all is good.  Thank you so very much for all the research and production of these life saving vaccines.

ER nurse gave vaccine and 10-15 mins after vaccine pt started to feel dry mouth and felt her throat closing off. She stated she had had anaphylaxis in the past and this was very similar. Pt was given EpiPen and admitted to the ER for further treatment. Pt&#39;s symptoms slowly resolved. Pt was started on IV and given Benadryl 25mg IV and solumedrol 125mg IV. She was observed for 2 hours and had stable vitals and symptoms didn&#39;t return. She received 1 liter of fluids.

Symptoms remind me of shingles-caused neuralgia which I sometimes experience on left side. Facial tingling, feeling of tightness in muscles, including inner ear are less familiar to me. Symptoms appear to change in degree--slight to more noticeable--as this first day wears on. (Now nearly five hours since vaccine.) I have gone about day as normal, eating and exercising, drinking plenty of water.

                                                I started experiencing chills and body aches approximately 12 hours after getting the injection.  I took my temperature (it was 99) and an Aleve. After the first 24 hours, my breathing became more shallow, and I had an increased hunger to add to the body aches.  I felt as if I had the flu.   At 36 hours after injection, I started having a head ache that caused me to be dizzy upon standing. I am making this report 46 hours after and I still have a slight headache and some nausea/excess saliva.

I am still very tired and having low grade temps with sweats and chills.

Patient reported that on 4/8, she woke at 0100 with &#34;toe cramps&#34;, she got out of bed, walked around and took some Tylenol, this resolved.  Then on 4/9 around 1400, she had what she described as &#34;the beginning of a migraine&#34; in which she had blurry/wavy vision.  She has had migraines in the past, however they are very infrequent.  She is not treated for migraines due to their infrequency.  In the past, she would take a Tylenol at the first sign of blurry/wavy vision and this would prevent a full blown migraine.  On 4/10 at 0530, patient woke from &#34;charlie horse&#34; in left calf.  She got up, walked around again and took a Tylenol, this resolved.  Later that same day, patient developed the blurry/wavy vision again, took a Tylenol again and this resolved.  On 4/11, patient reported soreness in left calf from previous day&#39;s cramp and used heating pad.  Patient has had 2 more episodes of blurry/wavy vision yesterday 4/12 and today, 4/13, which both resolved with Tylenol.  Patient has not yet spoked with PCP.  Due to the nature of the events, and the recent update of J&amp;J vaccines,

                                                I contracted Herpes zooster in 1990, and  was treated with Valtrex (3 times a day for 3 days) which help to keep control of the virulence of the episodes. Through the years the number of episodes went down (2-3 times a year). In the last 5 years they were so mild that I did not need to use any medication. However, after receiving the COVID vaccine I had a bad case of Herpes in the genital area but in addition and first time since I contracted it I also have blisters in one eye and the mouth.  I first had a blister in the right side of my lips and a couple of days later I had another one on the left side of my eyelid. It is painful and I am alarmed because I never had these before.

The following day there were more floaters in my vision. The outside of my vision had a dark spot. I managed to drive to work but it was scary. Every day the vision in my right eye was getting darker. At Eye Center I saw an eye specialist and I was told that my retina was detached. I had surgery to reattach my retina 04/09/2021. I am still having trouble seeing and my vision is still blurry after four weeks after surgery for Retinal Detachment.

Ignored both symptoms at the time. About 30 minutes after vaccine on my way home in the car throat started feeling swollen and I found it difficult to swallow. Lips and tongue felt swollen (even though they didn&#39;t loot it). Metallic taste in mouth and could smell a weird earthy smell. Went to ER to seek assistance, by the time I got to the ER symptoms were starting to subside.  Kept under observation for the rest of the afternoon before being discharged Prescribed an EpiPen and followed up with Primary Care Physician.  After about a week started feeling a pain deep in my right calf, no other symptoms so have not sought medical care.  Today 2 weeks after vaccine still have slight pain in calf, seems to be subsiding with time.

                                                Two hours after receiving vaccine, I experienced sudden onset extremely painful throat, swollen gooey uvula, followed by hives on face, neck, chest, and underarms, moderately swollen lips and eye areas. I took Benadryl 1/2 hour after onset, eventually resolving hives and face swelling. 25 hours later, I&#39;m still experiencing the painful throat/swollen uvula issue. Appetite is fine, though swallowing is painful. Injection sight became painful 18-20 hours after vaccination.

                                                On March 22nd (8 days after the vaccination I noticed a red bump on my right eyebrow that itched. At first, I thought it was an insect bite. Today, March 22rd, I noticed a red rash on my face (similar to rosacea). My cheeks and ears feel warm to the touch, and I have a mild itch on the entire  area. The rash is more prominent on the right side of the face. This has not happened to me before. I am planning on taking an OTC antiallergic to calm the symptoms.

                                                At the injection site - it was a little sore after about three days. A week after vaccine, it hurt to touch my eye - I thought I had pink eye but it wasn&#39;t itchy. I treated it with hot compress. I did that at least 3 times a day for two days. It was really swollen  - lower eye lid of my left eye - right in the middle of it - on the inside of the eyelid I can see a bump in the middle of it and so I was kind of pushing on my eye a little and it looked like fluid was coming out of my tear duct and so I put a hot compress on it often and it&#39;s getting a little better each day. I&#39;m 70% better.

                                                About 45 minutes after receiving my Covid vaccine I noticed my lower lip started to swell there was no swelling in my throat). I took Benadryl. I needed to continue taking the Benadryl every 4 - 6 hours because the swelling kept coming back. Later I noticed my lungs getting scratchy. I started using my nebulizer to stay ahead of it. I took two Benadryl before going to sleep. When I woke up I noticed my lips starting swell up again and my lungs were still scratchy. I took my peak flow and it have dropped to 345 (my normal is about 375/380). I contacted my Pulmonologist and her recommended that I go to Urgent Care and report my reaction to the CDC. I went to the Urgent Care. The doctor told me to continue with the Benadryl and nebulizer treats and she also added Pepcid and Prednisone.   It is now one week out and I am still experiencing the lip swelling and itchiness on my face  so I am still currently taking the Benadryl. From time to time my lungs my lungs feel scratchy.

Finally fell asleep around 5:30am still with a really bad headache.  Woke up at 11:00am.  Brushed my teeth and started to feel nausea.  I went back to my bedroom and I got lightheaded to where my vision was blurred.  Layed on the bed and felt really bad with a sweaty face and still nauseas.  Had someone bring me grapes and some tea and layed there.  I felt bad for about 45 min. then I fell asleep.  Got up about 3:30 hours later feeling better, but not 100%  Still a bit of a headache but nausea went away.  Today I feel back to my normal self.  I thought you&#39;d like to know I did experience some of the side effects for your records.

Within seconds I started feeling nauseous and my mouth filled with saliva. I started to feel faint. I left work 30 minutes early. I had to take my pants off and put on pajama pants because that is the only thing that would fit me. The pain from my abdomen was around my female organs. I laid down and my quads started to ache and I developed a fever. I did take some Tylenol which helped with the pain. I took Tylenol all week. My abdomen was still swollen come Friday and I developed brain fog. I was really having trouble recalling my normal daily routines and people I work with. This lingered on for 3 weeks. My head feels clear now, but I am still having trouble remembering normal daily activities and recall.

                                                On 04/21/2021, 12 days after I received the vaccine, I woke up with my entire left side feeling numb and I had a headache. I felt like I had pressure on my chest and I was really lightheaded. I got up for a little while and I felt like I was going to faint. I felt like I needed to eat something and I was very weak. I drank some juice and ate an orange. I was having a hard time swallowing and at times slurred my words. I realized that something serious was going on because I had pain like when I went through chemo. The base of my spine has been hurting every day since I received the vaccine and I have had headaches since as well. I was having heart palpitations and felt super weak. I didn&#39;t go to work for 2 days. That was 04/21 and 04/22. On 04/23 I had to do a zoom conference for work, for an hour, and my eyes starting hurting really bad like my eyes had been open for 24 hours. The light from the computer screen was really affecting me. At 5pm I did a tele-video appointment with the NP. She told me that she wanted me to go urgent care because it was the closest urgent care to me. After going to Urgent Care on 04/24, the doctor wanted me to go to the Hospital by ambulance. At the hospital the performed an EKG, CTA and MRA and they said that everything looked fine. They couldn&#39;t validate that my pain was from Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I was release at 10:30pm PT, I called Dr., my Oncology surgeon, and he referred me to Neurology doctor. I got an appointment with Dr., 04/27, and she ordered a CTA and an MRA. I had the scans completed on 04/28, with and without contrast. The radiologist found something. I was sent back home, but I was told that right vertebral artery was completely excluded. In January of 2020, there was a CTA performed, and I didn&#39;t have any numbness and my vertebral artery still have a steady flow even though there was a tear. It also showed that I had more stenosis in my carotid artery. I have now been referred to a new Neurosurgeon. Dr. never saw me because they couldn&#39;t view my records. The doctor told me to take Crestor and 81 mg aspirin. I did not feel that those medications helped at all. If anything, I felt worse. on 05/15, I was in the passenger seat of my grandson&#39;s car and I ended up throwing up and there was blood coming out with the vomit. He took me the Hospital. I had a video appointment on 05/11, with an NP, and she told me to up my aspirin to 325mg and continue to take Crestor. She referred me to The Stroke Neurology Group and she referred me to get a CTA. She also referred me to a GI doctor. On 05/15, against medical advice, and was taken by ambulance to another hospital. I stayed there until 3AM 05/16. They performed an MRA, a CT, Stroke Angiogram, they MRI with and without contrast, a chest x-ray and a lot of blood work. They also performed are lactate test and at first it came back as 2.5, which made them think I had an infection, but they re-tested and it came back as 1.5 which they said to be normal. The results from the hospitals. On 05/19 I went to see a Cardiologist, and she took me off of Crestor and put on pravastatin. She order an echocardiogram and a treadmill test and an EKG. I did see a GI doctor and they told me that the aspirin that I was told to take is what was making me throw up blood. I do have a neurology appointment on 06/11 and I have an appointment with the neurosurgeon on 06/16. My last heart test came back normal.

                                                Got my vaccine today  It hurt when the pulled the needle out  About 30 minutes after on my way home. My finger tips on my left arm went numb, same arm where I received the shot.  By the time I got home  I had a headache, so I took some tylenol.   My mouth is dry on and off. They told me to drink water and Gatorade  I slept for about 5 hours. I feel better but I still have a dry mouth.  The next morning my arm was swollen and itchy around the injection. I used an ice pack for the swelling.  About 24 hours later I was sweating on and off and my headache continued. I took another tylenol. And my body muscles were hurting.  I did not see a physician during any of the episodes.  It&#39;s the morning of March 23rd and I feel okay today.

A headache was felt all day, becoming increasingly painful as the day continued.  It was sharp, intense pain in temples, across the forehead that pounded.  Intense pain behind the eyes for 2 hours before the fever broke. I had not taken any pain or fever reliever all day - wanting to let the vaccine run it&#39;s course, however at 3:30 I took one acetaminophen tablet.  I could not take the headache anymore.  By 4:30 the headache had eased up and the fever was at 100.  By 5:30 the headache was gone, temperature was at 98. I then slept for the entire night.  The next day - no fever or pains/aches, just tired.  I felt like myself by the end of the day.

Still having the tinnitis today and will likely need to schedule a doctor&#39;s appointment soon, if it doesn&#39;t go away.

                                                FYI, Approx. 1:00 AM woke up with high fever and could hardly move. Whole body hurt very bad. Shaking from chills . Bad headache. Very thirsty. Definitely flu like symptoms, but worse. Turned electric blanket on, very cold, and just tried to sleep. Only getting out of bed to use restroom and more water. Straight back to bed. I did not vomit, nor did I have diarrhea.  Could not stand it any longer Saturday PM approx. 10:00 took two Advil. Woke up Sunday 8:00 AM felt much better. Still had slight symptoms, but I could do chores. My brother kept checking on me. Came to let my dog out. My brother wanted me to call 911 but I can not afford that.  It was holiday weekend,  I wanted to die, didn?t care.  I get the flu shot every year. I have a high pain tolerance, very rare for me to be sick.  If I needed a second dose. I would NOT get it. If I would have known it was that bad, I would not have signed up to get it. Thank you.

                                                Ended up putting the injection in the back of the left shoulder - she missed my arm muscle. I went to the doctor (I saw the dr on the 8th) and had her look at it. Immediately my mouth, nose and sinuses went numb. I had chills, fever, aches and pains - I was pretty sick for a few days but this original numbness has not gone away. The dr said to leave it alone and she thought by the weekend I would be fine but I&#39;m still feeling the numbness.  (I had a Tetanus shot in February after I cut myself.)

Extreme Weakness, Nausea , especially when I would try to eat .  Increased thirst/ urination .  My ankles and feet swelled .  My friend who is a pharmacist instructed me to take a Tylenol but I couldn?t even get out of bed to get one to take.  ? any movement made my head swim and I felt like I would throw up.

Ringing is mostly constant and tolerable and doesn&#39;t prevent day to day activities, although can make it harder to focus at work. Does affect my ablitiy to fall back to sleep once I&#39;ve woken (at say 4 AM). Seems to be worse in early morning, when it is typically quiet.  Haven&#39;t seeked medical attention so far.

                                                Eight days after receiving the vaccine, my wife developed shortness of breath, headache, fatigue, and unusual vision problems. She was taken to the emergency room on 4/15 where she underwent a battery of tests (see details below). She was admitted to the hospital (where she currently is) and was diagnosed with blood clots in the lungs and two strokes in the area of the brain that affects vision. She then underwent ultrasound tests of her legs and carotid artery, which were negative for signs of blood clots. Although my wife&#39;s symptoms are different than the symptoms of others that led to the vaccine pause, her doctors strongly encouraged us to report it to the VAERS. My wife had no underlying or pre existing conditions that would lead to blood clots in her lungs, and stroke. After extensive testing there is no evidence that the blood clots in her lungs as well as the clot/clots that went to her brain initiated in her legs. They believe that some sort of &#34;event&#34; would have had to happen to cause these blood clots, and the only unusual thing in the time frame of this condition is the vaccine. As I mentioned earlier, my wife is still hospitalized.

                                                Immediately that evening, I started to get headachy and nauseous. My arm in the injection site was very sore. The next morning, the other arm was sore. It was difficult for me to raise my arms above my head without feeling extremely weak. I couldn&#39;t lift anything above my head for the fear I would drop them. Knee replacement surgery on both knees about 4 years ago - I felt pain in my knees; all my joints; all of my teeth; my vision was blurry. My head hurt so badly. Tylenol dulled the headache and joint pain but it didn&#39;t help it to go away. My chest also hurt quite a bit. I felt extremely lethargic.  I didn&#39;t feel like getting out of bed. I could only get the  meals  made (I&#39;m a caregiver for my mom and mother-in-law) and then get back into bed. I usually walk five miles a day. I&#39;m still not there yet ( to walk that much) but I&#39;m getting better. The nausea lasted until the 17th. The headache just left finally on April 23. The body aches, teeth ache and joints subsided around the 17th also. The blurry vision - I still have a a little bit of that but it&#39;s starting to improve. The weakness in the arm - that is starting to improve - I do still feel kind of weak when I raise my arms above my head. The fatigue I still have but I&#39;m feeling a bit of improvement.  I have to keep checking my bed to see if I accidentally put the massage setting on (and I hadn&#39;t) because my body was shaking  in entire  body- That started on the second day after the vaccine and stopped about the 19th. I called to the advice nurse to register my health complaint and she had me come in for a full workup. And she asked me to go to ER. They kept me in the ER overnight.

This has never happened before. My shoulder/arm were sore for approximately one week which seemed typical to how I respond to a vaccine. After a week I began experiencing a sharp pain in my neck and shoulder area which has gradually worsened to where I am now icing it multiple times per day. There is also numbness and tingling down my forearm and into my thumb and index finger.  The pain is unmanageable at times and I am unable to get a full nights rest and have near constant pain when keyboarding.

                                                On about day 17 after the vaccination I started having pulsing (heartbeat type pulsing -tinnitus) in my right ear.  I didn&#39;t make the connection that it could be related to the vaccine as I had no side effects after my shot.  I didn&#39;t report it to my doctor as i thought it was just congestion or water in my ear.  It was an annoying heavy pulsing but no ringing.  It wasn&#39;t until I talked to a friend who had the same thing that we wondered if it could be related to the vaccine.  Mine has quieted down as of today 05/03/21, though I still notice it from time to time.  Just as I think it has gone away I will notice a few pulses in my ear.  I saw an article about numbers of people having similar symptoms after their vaccinations and thought I should report it here.

I also noticed my lymph nodes were all swollen and sore, the ones in my neck were the worst, I had a severe headache, I was extremely fatigued and body aches. The body aches were excruciating. I was bed ridden for 3 days . I also had nausea and completely lost my appetite. I remember being very thirsty. I had really sever fatigue, it took a week before I started feeling better. I had to take a week off of work. I&#39;m having a really hard time with fatigue now. It seemed to cause what I would call is a huge flair up of my fibromyalgia .

                                                She got her vaccine at about 6:30, and the bottom of her foot started swelling, then the to of her foot, ankle, tingling of her feet (both), neuropathy pain came back which she hadn&#39;t had in a long time.    The spinal stenosis pain came back very strongly and her fibromyalgia pain came back and they were all pretty well managed prior to the vaccine.   She is still having that pain.  She is on a pain management regimen to control her pain prior to the vaccine, and then it has worsened and was scheduled for an epidural spinal shot and not able to get off the Eliquis due to the vaccine and that has been postponed.  She was on Duloxetine for the neuropathy pain and it had been being managed and then all of a sudden that pain has worsened and the medicine she was taking for that did not work anymore.  She went to the ER on 5/5/21, and they gave her Morphine for the pain, and discharged her home with Tramadol.  The 2nd ER visit was on 5/15/21, as when she woke up both of her legs were numb, and could not feel her legs from her ankle to her hip/waste area.  When she opened her eyes she thought she was looking at the side wall and was looking at the ceiling and could not discern where she was, was disoriented and called her doctor and told to go to the ER.   She went to the ER and they finally took it seriously and they suggested that she had inflammation in her system that was causing her other problems to flare up.  She made appointments with her specialists to see where the inflammation was.  She then saw a rheumatologist as when she went to the ER the 2nd time they wanted to put her on steroids and she did not want to be put on it due to her diabetes.  She did have drug-induced lupus at one point from isoniazid.  Her rheumatologist confirmed she did have inflammation on blood work and told her to take the steroids.   The steroids have taken down some of the pain, but not completely.  She did have a lumbar epidural steroid injection yesterday 6/9/21 at L4 bilaterally, which has helped as of today.   She was put on Tramadol after the first ER visit by her pain management doctor and that did not work.  After that she was switched to Hydrocodone which has helped her.    Her cardiologist, rheumatologist and PCP told her that it hit things that impacted her nervous system and that she has inflammation in her system, does not know exactly where it is and it has impacted her system and caused intensity of her spinal stenosis, neuropathy and fibromyalgia.  She is still undergoing treatment for these symptoms.    She was not feeling her neuropathy pain hardly at all prior to the vaccine.   On She woke up and both of her legs were numb, and could not feel her legs from her ankle to her hip/waste area.  When she opened her eyes she thought she was looking at the side wall and was looking at the ceiling and could not discern where she was, was disoriented and called her doctor and told to go to the ER.    She has not been able to return to work as a teacher due to the reaction she has been having.  She wants to know what the efficacy is now that she has had a reaction or has it lessened or does she have any protection at all now.

                                                Daily persistent headaches, ear pain, hyperacusis, feeling like my head is under water, brain fog, lethargy, balance issues:  I had the J&amp;J on April 12th. On the 20th I was awakened by fluid in my ears. I had a spot of blood from my left ear, and fluid from both. Then more ear fluid and head pressure and headache and head-cold symptoms developed over the next few days along with brain fog. By that weekend, I had a slight fever, symptoms worsened, and I was also sneezing and had a very runny nose. Took a rapid test and antibody test that Sunday, the 25th. Both Negative. On the 26th, I tested negative with a PCR test. Preplanned by my rheumatologist, I also had multiple labs drawn. Normal, except my Sed Rate had doubled from what it was on 3/23, and my Fibrinogen was high at 512. Phos, Mg, CMP, CBC, D-Dimer, were WNL. My daughter tested negative for Covid but positive for strep on 4/26, so my dr put me on Azithromycin for 5 days. He saw me the next day after confirming a negative PCR, on 4/27 to confirm that my ears were red, but my eardrums looked okay, and my throat was slightly red. On 5/4, I saw my PCP again and symptoms were unchanged. He put me on Neomycin/Polymyxin w/ HC Otic drops for a week, then steroids for a week after that when he saw me again on 5/14.  At this point, occasional dizziness/light-headedness was increasing, added to the other symptoms. I tried 3 different antihistamines though I have no environmental allergies but that didn?t help either. I started the methylprednisolone 4mg pack on 5/17 after I had the CT scan that he ordered. That was normal. When I close my eyes, my balance is off.  I used to have no problem with that, and would often walk to the bathroom in the middle of the night with the lights off and eyes closed. So I saw an ENT on 5/26, and my ears looked okay. Hearing and fluid tests were good too. Though the audiologist had to turn the left side volume down because it was too loud. I have developed hyperacusis, left ear. I had an MRI scan on 6/10, with a 1.5T machine, and that looks normal too. Now I will be seeing an Acupuncturist starting 6/14, and a Neurologist before the end of June as recommended by my ENT for suspected vestibular migraines.

                                                The morning of the 8th I had a stuffy nose I took an Alka-Seltzer. I went into work. By the afternoon, I felt awful, I was aching, really bad headache, and I felt cold also. I went home and went to bed. I decided to go through the weekend and the symptoms did not go away. I did an e-visit with my doctor and she prescribed an antibiotic. She advised to do the COVID-19 test. I received my chart notification and they told me I was positive for COVID-19.  I was on quarantine for 10 days. I also had pressure in my ears. I also lost my sense of taste and smell. I felt awful.  The first few days I felt awful and then the symptoms stared to get better over time. Now I have this lingering cough that will not go away, but it not productive.
