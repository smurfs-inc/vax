                                                Dizzy, run down two hours after injection. Woke up 4 am then off and on with extreme body pain, sore neck , lower back, right hand and arm. Headache and fatigue at 6:45 am got up with two children (2 yrs and 10 months) ate small breakfast by 9 am I couldn?t get off the couch or stay awake. My head started aching and my eyes hurt, I felt extreme chills two thick blankets weren?t enough to warm me. Extreme fatigue, stomach pain and loss of appetite. I fell asleep and didnt have the energy to walk to my bed until 2:30 pm.  It set off my stomach and I was vomiting off and on until around 9 pm. By then I could keep little bits of fluid and food down. Then I was hot. I felt flushed but had no fever. My usual heart rate is 52-54 bpm via Watch while laying down. My heart rate during this hot period laying in bed was 102 -101 bpm. Which is consistent for my workout heart rate. I went to sleep and woke up 7 am with my kids and was well enough to take care of them but not do all my usual chores. I couldn?t bend down or put my head lower than chest or the extreme throbbing headache was back. Still had body aches and fatigue but nowhere near yesterday. It is 11:22 pm Sunday and I feel spent.

                                                My vaccine was administered at 12:30pm. I waited until 12:55 at CVS after the vaccine to make sure there were no reactions. I also move my arm around a lot after the injection to keep it from hurting. I drove home, at lunch and about 2:45 was hit with a very noticeable headache. I never get headaches and eat healthy and consume about a gallon of water a day. I knew it wasn&#39;t from dehydration or being hungry.  Headache was in the temple area and made my eyes hurt in the same way they would if you had cried for an extended period of time or were overtired. At 3pm a wave of exhaustion hit me. I was sitting working trying to combat the headache and felt almost wiped out. I got through the rest of my work day (4:30) and went to lay down immediately. I passed out almost instantly until 7 pm. I work up and showered, ate dinner and started to feel a little warm. It should be noted it was an unseasonably warm day and got up to 77, so it was a tiny bit warm in my home. I put on loose fitting clothes and slayed on the couch still with the bad headache and the injection site started to throb so I placed and ice pack on for 20 minutes. I could only stay awake until 8:45 and got in bed. I could not get comfortable for several hours feeling very warm. I tried a fan on high and drinking more water but i felt very warm like how you feel with the flu. I took my temp at 1130pm it was normal. I continued to toss and turn and feel very warm and slightly dizzy, in the sense that I hadn&#39;t been able to sleep and with the headache my body was just exhausted. Around 2 am i woke up for more water and got in the shower because I had sweated so much my sheets were wet and my clothes. I got out of the shower around 10 minutes later, changed and got new sheets and got back in bad. Around 330 I felt very hot again and opened the windows and got another ice pack for my arm which was throbbing again. I finally fell asleep after 3:45am. I got up for work at 6am. I felt slightly foggy, and very hot. But no fever. My temp is normally around 97.4-97.9 and it was 98.4. Still normal but I was running warmer than usual. It took a long time to get ready and despite hot water in the shower I was freezing. i got dress and debated going to work. Got in the car at 6:45 and my drive to work is 30 minutes. 1/2 way into my drive I got very sweaty again and went home to change my clothes because they were too warm. Got to work around 7:20 and still felt warm but they take our temps at the door and min was still okay, no fever. I drank a lot of water and ate, and at 8:30 am all of a sudden the exhaustion was gone and I felt normal. I got home form work at 5:30p and took a 3 hour nap and felt normal again.

                                                I woke up with an excruciating headache (with light sensitivity) that did not initially respond to Tylenol. Although I did not have a fever, I had temperature regulation issues all night - alternating between hot and cold - and woke up sweaty.  Headache responded to Advil in the morning but I still have a minor lingering headache a few hours later.

                                                I noticed it felt like a sinus cold coming on along with face, head and minor toothaches to the my left side of my face on the the 8th or 9th. I took Tylenol everyday for my sore arm and the headaches but it did help suppress them so I didn?t think much of it. My throat also started to feel kind of raw or itchy but I didn?t have a cough and I noticed a slight post nasal drip. Ok the 10th in the evening I felt exhausted and my face and sinuses were much worse. I took cold medicine and fell asleep early but had a hard time sleeping. I?m a side sleeper and if I turned on my left side, my ear felt like it was burning and my face would go numb. It also made me very dizzy. I woke up with body aches and light headed. My throat doesn?t hurt but it feels different. Almost numb like nothing and I can?t smell or taste.

                                                Exactly an hour after recieving the shot, I started horribly itching from head to toe and had a red rash. I took 2 zyrtec. The allergy meds helped but once they wore off I would start itching. Two days after the shot my face got really puffy especially around the eyes. For six days I took 2 Zyrtec in the morning and 1 benadryl at night. After 6 days of the allergy meds I finally was back to normal.

                                                She got the vaccine she was fine, had a mild cramping in her stomach.  She wakes up at 5:00 AM in the morning for work and on Friday she could not put her feet on the ground for pain in her legs.  She also had a bad headache on the left side and took Advil for that, and then the headache switched to the right side.  She then took another Advil, and that was all she took that day and was that way the whole weekend.  She had pain all weekend and could not touch herself as the pain was so bad.  She also had chills, nauseated, her vision was going in and out as if she was at the eye doctors office.  Her uncle brought her mother over to her as she could not take care of herself or drive to take care of her cousin who she takes care of.  She went to go work on Monday 3/26/21  then she started having difficulty breathing  and her employer called the EMT&#39;s, they checked her heart rate which was high and did her oxygen level which was fine, and were afraid she may have gone into cardiac arrest, and told her to rest.  She called her doctor who told her that it was a bad reaction to the vaccine.   She is still having difficulty breathing after walking so far, she weighs 115# and has always been a small person.  She was not given any medications by her doctor and told her to rest and if it worsened to call her back.    She had been seen two weeks prior by her doctor for a sinus infection and was given an allergy shot and some other injection of which she does not know what it was, possibly a steroid.

With history of panic attacks we observed closely.  After 25 minutes, and symptoms getting worse, we decided it was best to administer epi-pen and called 911.  Symptoms got a bit better after a minute. After about 7 minutes another epi-pen was administered as symptoms were starting to get worse again.

As the minutes passed, the feeling of fullness was more pronounced. We offered EPI-PEN and to call 911. Patient wanted 911 only. We called 911, took her blood pressure (188/119). Paramedics arrived within 1 minute. After examination, patient was transported to hospital at 1:30p.m. accompanied by family members. At 3:55p.m.,  I spoke to her fiancé to inquire about her well being. She was still at ER at 3:55 p.m. She was given Benadryl, EpiPen, and Prednisone. Fiancé said she was breathing better but there was a rash and itching at injection site which was being treated with Benadryl and Prednisone. Fiancé said patient was frustrated at having to be at emergency room.

I felt super tired but my body would not let me sleep. I also had muscle aches and cramps with lower back and leg with a throbbing sensation. This was within 12 hours. About 5 days later, my eye started to hurt, went to se my eye doctor and they found out I have ocular herpes. I am on now on some antiviral eye medication. I could tell after the vaccine I had a viral type infection. I still have not recovered and I will see my eye doctor tomorrow.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Approx 7 p.m.,  I noticed moderate pain in my lower back, hips, and legs. Around 7 30, I felt very cold and began covering up with several blankets and turning up the heat. Husband and kids reported the house was not cold at all. Within 15 minutes, chills began and increased quickly to an almost violent state. I was shivering so badly, it became painful and scary. My husband added three blankets on top of our down comforter and sent me to bed. It took approx 15 minutes to warm up, stop shivering, and slow teeth chattering enough to relax and fall asleep. Awoke around 1:30am feeling incredibly thirsty and in desperate need of water. Upon standing, the pain in my body was excruciating which made it extremely difficult to walk. Finally in the kitchen, I took Ibuprofen 800mg and filled a large bottle with water. I began to feel incredibly dizzy and needed help from my husband to get to the couch. It took approximately 2 hours before I began to feel any relief from the ibuprofen. Around 6:30 a.m., about 60 to 65% of the pain had abated and I had finished around 100oz of water. The remainder of the day was spent feeling extreme fatigue and a general sense of unwell. Appetite was poor throughout entire event. This all continued into the evening until bedtime at 11pm. Experienced moderate insomnia overnight, falling asleep around 2:30am. Could not fall asleep due to constantly thinking about the stress of the previous 24&#43; hours. Upon waking this morning, I feel almost back up to 100%.

I also felt chills.  My temperature was 98.8 F.  Over the course of the next three or four hours, I have felt strong sensations of aching and throbbing in my chest, back, hands, inner ears, and neck.  I also felt pins and needles all over but most strongly in chest, back, hands, inner ears, and sides of my neck.

It sounded like woody woodpecker when my teeth were chattering against my mouth guard. Then the fever came in. 17 hours after the vaccine, my fever is still at 101.  Did not sleep much. Woke up with severe headache and muscle pain. Drank a gallon of water yesterday and 32 oz in the middle of the night. Despite that, I?m still thirsty.

                                                I had a very bad case of Covid in January 2021 and have not regained my taste or smell.  I was in bed for 2 weeks and had a prolonged fever up to 105 degrees--so high that I had visual and auditory hallucinations.  I had hair loss in the following months and I also continue to be fatigued.    I received the vaccination on 4/6/21 around 11am; a slight headache and face flushing occurred about 30 minutes after shot, but generally felt ok.  Woke up at 4am on 4/7/21 with chills, extreme joint pain, body aches, migraine headache, and a fever of 101.5 degrees.  Took Tylenol around 6am and went back to bed.  The migraine headache, chills, body aches, and extreme joint pain continued.  I was dizzy and extremely fatigued.  Woke up around 9 am and fever was at 102.7 degrees.  Joint pain and headache were almost unbearable at this point and I took a hydrocodone.  Took temperature around 12 pm and it was 103.5 degrees.  Fever continued rising to 104.4 degrees at 2:30 pm.  Took another Tylenol and went to sleep.  The next day, my fever had fallen back down to 102.5 degrees.  I continued with Tylenol to control me fever to around 101 degrees.   My fever persisted for 3 days.  I still have extreme fatigue, joint pain, burning scalp (which will likely mean more hair loss), zero appetite and weight loss, dizziness, blurred vision, etc.  The side effects are exactly how i felt when I got Covid in January.

The second day these symptoms had stopped.

This lasted for about a day. 48 hours after the vaccine my eye sight became blurry, my ears began ringing and my face became tingly around mouth and cheeks. The tingling is intermittent but the ear ringing and blurry vision has been fairly constant.

                                                I had burning with the actual injection.  It burned as it went in and went down a small ways into my left arm.  The rest of the day I had the normal symptoms- Pounding headache, nausea, horrible body aches (couldn?t lay down or stand to be comfortable).  That night around 11:45pm I got up to let my dog in and I started seeing small black dots- blurry vision.  I felt nauseas.  I ended up falling on the floor.  I was able to get up.  I then ended up waking up in the bathroom on the floor and had no idea how I had gotten there.  My hands were vibrating.  I called my husband from work to come help me up.  I was able to sleep and didn?t seek medical attention.  I am not sure if it was low blood pressure or what could have happened I have never experienced that before.  I did contact my doctor?s office this afternoon via (online) but haven?t had a response yet.  I have been in bed all day today.  - Body aches, nausea, pounding headache

What is still left of that pain on day 5 is a pain radiating from my lower back down my right leg many times throughout the day (treating with ibuphrophen).   Pain around knees, elbows, ankles, and bottom of feet- different than joint pain.  All my POTS symptoms are in high gear (tachycardias, very low BP,  pain, dizzy, vertigo).    If the leg/lower back pain, and left arm problems continue, I will see my neurologist or immunologist.  I have reached out to both to make them aware.  My husband had the JJ shot same day, same place and had zero side affects.

                                                I was directed to my seat (if walking into the room, the first table but the 2nd seat).  The woman was learning the computer system from a gentleman, and she assured me she just didn&#39;t know the computer, but knew how to give a shot.  I pulled my arm out of my sweatshirt and pushed my short sleeve shirt up.  She did the alcohol wipe, then pinched my arm, I looked away as the shot went in.  I felt a horrible pain...not even sure how to describe it, just extreme pain and very achy and said Ow maybe 3 times (I am one that can tolerate quite a bit of pain, and I assumed it would sting, but this was different) as she was injecting me.  She apologized. The gentleman said Johnson and Johnson is a little thicker.  I said to him that I had never ever experienced this much pain with a vaccine before-never.  Again, I am talking about as it was injected. I went to sit down for the waiting area, the gentleman who was handing out cards for reviews asked me about it and I said it hurt so bad, I&#39;d never had a shot hurt that bad.  Another worker (female) overheard me and asked me if it was a burning-she had a burning with hers (think she said moderna). I said I would not necessarily say it was a burning, it was pain. As I sat there, I texted my husband and told him how bad it hurt (with the injection) and I&#39;ve never had a vaccine hurt like that.  I started to wonder if it was administered incorrectly? I looked over and the gentleman was now doing the vaccines and she was watching. My husband had Pfizer and he said that didn&#39;t hurt at all. I was feeling it up into my neck as I was sitting there. I was trying to rub my arm and neck hoping that would help as well as move my arm around. When we could leave, I asked the volunteer if she had heard of anyone else having that much pain DURING the shot.  She said she only heard of maybe one other person that said ow. I left, started to cry in the car because of the pain and experience, then spoke with my husband before I left. I came home and got some ice to put on my arm hoping that would help. I did expect pain in the arm after a shot. Within a couple of hours, I noticed pain going down my arm and into my wrist. I thought maybe I needed to be active with my arm and move it so tried that.  I started to notice more side effects of the vaccine as the evening progressed:  I had the typical side effects I figured I&#39;d have, achy, joint pain, chills, nauseous, no fever though. I was noticing pain into my neck (occasionally even into jaw), shoulder, scapula area of the back, and left side under the bottom part of my ribs.  I was feeling tightness in my chest, too, so I decided to try 2 aspirin to see if it helped with any symptoms. I did have slight dizziness, and a weird sensation in my head-like a zapping? I didn&#39;t sleep well, and had to stay completely off of my left side. Thursday, I felt better than that night, but still tired, achy, nauseous, chills, and not 100%.  My arm still was really affected...it seemed extremely fatigued as well as painful...the pain was radiating up and down and couldn&#39;t raise my arm without it hurting. Around noon I decided to take 2 aleve to see if that would help me at all. It did help with the pain and achiness, but was getting a &#34;nerve-type&#34; pain still up and down my left arm into neck/scapula area down to my wrist and hand/fingers. Still couldn&#39;t sleep on my left side. Friday, I was definitely doing better with all the other symptoms, I could abduct my arm more than 90 degrees, so I was excited about that. I did wake up with my middle/ring finger hurting (at the base of that area) and a bit numb so put my hand in and out of a fist. The pain subsided, but the numbness/tingling sensation was still there. I continued to take aleve hoping that maybe there was just inflammation around the nerve causing the issue.  Aleve did help, but it still never went away completely.  By late afternoon, I was getting concerned if I was permanently affected by this. As I was holding a bowl of food and eating, my left arm was going numb. I was even feeling it into my gluts (sciatica?). Again...all of this was after the shot and only on the side I received the shot. That evening I was able to lay on my left side, but not for long periods of time because it became uncomfortable and arm would go numb. Saturday, I still had the nerve pain and was not in a good spot.  It made me sad, angry, scared, and I didn&#39;t want to talk about it too much-just wanted my arm and all the different radiating pains I was having to be back to normal. I was feeling it up into my neck, scapula, my side(the rib area I previously mentioned), even into my gluts and down leg near ankle as well as down the arm into elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand, fingers (particularly that middle finger and thumb area).  I tried to use my arm as normally as possible thinking maybe I need to just keep it moving, but it would fatigue, especially between shoulder and neck. I tried Ibuprofen on this day.  Again, the pain relievers helped some, but didn&#39;t take it all away. Sunday I was in a horrible spot mentally and crying throughout the day because of the sensations I was feeling still: up and down the arm, shoulder, neck, scapula, side and still into ankle area. I decided I would call my doctor on Monday. Monday, I woke up and was feeling better overall, but still having the nerve sensations down my arm as well as up into shoulder, neck, scapula and my left side.  But everything was not as intense.  I spoke to my doctor who said there was a protocol, a number I needed to call.  Monday night I took ibuprofen because I started to have a horrible headache-didn&#39;t go away completely and still have this morning-not sure if it&#39;s related or just a normal headache. Still feeling tingling nerve sensations into forearm and fingers.  My shoulder/neck area feels fatigued, but so far not noticing the nerve pain yet, so that&#39;s a positive. On Monday,  it seemed to get worse as the day went on, so we will see. I definitely feel in hand/wrist/fingers as I am typing now. I know this is a lot, and I think I&#39;ve captured it.  Again, I had none of this pre-shot.  The pain during injection is what alarmed me most as I expected side effects after the shot, but not this nerve type issue.  For this to be lasting as long as it is concerns me, and the fact that it exhibits on my left side where I got the shot. I am very anxious as it hasn&#39;t gotten back to normal.

                                                I received the vaccine on March 27, 2021. Seconds after the injection was completed my vision went blurry, but it only lasted a few seconds. On March 28, 2021 I felt like my body was going to explode. My blood in the back of my head was thumping. I tried to take a nap to calm my body down but my body felt comp!eye unrest and thumping. My urine made the whole inside of the toilet water look like a white thick cloud.  I have never seen my urine look like that in my life. I used my husbands blood pressure monitor and my blood pressure was 152/104!  I arrived at urgent care about 5:30 PM. They gave me a blood pressure pill. I have never had a blood pressure pill my entire life. They also took a urine sample since I told them about the my very strange looking urine. They found protein and blood in my urine. The culture days later showed no infection. I am still having issues with the high blood pressure.

My arm was so super sore I couldnt lift it over my head.  On 3/10 the headache was still there but I  felt a little better.  But the ringing in my ears has been since day one and the headaches have been off and on as well since then also and on 3/25 I couldnt take it anymore so I went to see my PCP who referred me to an Audiologist but that appointment isnt until 4/29

She was sent home from work, she went to the nurses station at work, had a fever of 100.2 who told her to go home, it was a reaction from the vaccine, and to call us.

Arm was sore but no more than any other vaccine. close to 4 hours later, headache started, felt hot and cold. Hard to sleep, sweating a lot during the night. Headache was so bad it felt like a combination of a bad flu with a hangover. felt very thirty. In the morning I was dizzy, hot, cold, temp 99.8, sick to my stomach, coudn&#39;t taste food very well, just like when you have the flu, nothing taste good. I spend the following day in and out of sleep, very tired, hard to focus. The sensation for being hot and cold continued. Took Imitrex to alleviate the headache/migraine . I did help, but not much. Hard to eat due to an upset stomach. Today is the first full day. I hope I&#39;m better tomorrow

Shakin lasted for over 2hrs at which point I took 2 Tylenols. After 20min the shaking decreased. The shaking came back about 1.5hrs later. At that point I took 2 ibuprofens. The shaking went away. The entire following day had mild fever. have been tired physically for a week now after receiving the vaccine. Lost sense of smell and taste on the 3rd day after vaccination. It has since slowly improved. Botox injection sites (received Botox injection for migraine on March 4, 2 days before the J&amp;J vaccine) are still slightly red a week after the vaccine. My facial skin is breaking out also. Vaginal yeast infection started 4 days after receiving the vaccination. I feel slower than usual in my thinking processes since the vaccination.

All over body aches, no appetite, weakness, fatigue, headache, nasal congestion, burning eyes, ataxia, lightheadedness. Took my AM meds including hydrocodone-APAP which caused the fever to break but stayed low grade until the following afternoon around 2 PM. Helped with the body aches somewhat as well. Appetite started to return this morning, 3 days after the vaccine but the fatigue, weakness, muscular pain and a general unwell feeling continues.

After the majority of the body aches subsided, I ended up with facial pain from my temples all the was into my neck. This pain occurred on both sides of my face and was so bad that I couldn?t lay on my side with the side of my head on the pillow. The pain felt like severe joint pain, but also felt like it was in my glands. It felt like my salivary glands wanted to burst.  I used CBD cream topically to try to help with the pain, also CBD tincture internally. Finally resorted to Acetaminophen 1000mg. The acetaminophen seemed to help the tiniest bit. Then my fever broke. Once I began sweating I could feel the pain in my face almost melting away.  This lasted about three hours. When I woke up at 8:00AM the side effects seemed to have all subsided. I still had a very mild headache.

                                                Bell&#39;s palsy symptoms within an hour after receiving vaccine injection:  consisted of right-sided facial numbness, right-sided eyelid droop, right-sided mouth turn, right-sided tightness in neck muscle, pressure behind right eye, headache, loss of balance, difficulty speaking.  The injection was at 3:15 pm and started with arm soreness and stinging, a slight headache, and some tingling in my right hand while waiting 15 minutes after the shot, I had also felt a sensation going up the right side of the back of my neck almost immediately after the injection.  The Bell&#39;s palsy symptoms started by 4:00 pm.  I had a low-grade temp that evening of 99.9.  I emailed my neurologist who I see for migraines, of my symptoms.  The following morning on 03-10-2021 I woke with a severe migraine, fullness in my right ear, more pressure behind my right eye and it is watery, with new ringing in both ears, louder in the right ear.   Still residual numbness and drooping of right side of face and eye, tightness in right side neck muscle in front, and speaking better.   Woke up on Thursday morning 03-11-2021 with flu symptoms and migraine gone.  Eye pressure still there and now having significant pain moving my eye and now more feeling of fullness in my right ear.  Eye pain was concerning.  Dr advised me at this time if symptoms have continued or gotten worse to go to the emergency room.   Today, Saturday 03-13-2021, I am still experiencing moderate eye pain behind/above my right eye with pressure.  I am continuing to treat the pain with oxycodone prescribed by ER Physician.

That helped, fever went down to 99, then the meds wore off chills and pain returned. Started taking oxy and ibuprofen every hour on the hour from 2am until 2pm following day when I was then able to sort of sleep for 2 hours. Stopped taking meds. Took NAC to protect against all that ibuprofen. Took warm bath with bathsalts. Still feel sick but head pain and muscle aches have receeded.

Had an ear infection and was given a ten day regimen of amoxicillin. My ear is much better today.

Had an odd white noise in my ears - not &#34;ringing&#34; but buzzing kind of sound. Lasted for about 3-5 minutes and I ended up lying on the floor for about 15 minutes before I could get back up. Felt like I may blackout. It&#39;s three hours later and I&#39;m ok now.

                                                I had the shot on weds afternoon. On Thursday I felt ill with flu-like symptoms, mainly body aches and headache. These symptoms were gone by Friday and I felt great. I woke up Saturday morning at 4:30am and needed to use the bathroom/, which is about 10 steps from my bed. As I entered the bathroom I completely blacked out, causing me to fall and break my ribs. This has never happened to me, and there was nothing else wrong with me (I spent 2 days in the hospital checking heart, brain, inner ear, etc). In addition to the 4:30am blackout, it also happened again several hours later at 11am, saturday morning. This time I again got so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stay on my feet, and while my husband was right there lowering me to the floor I was in a daze, a cold sweat, and absolutely no control over it.

                                                The night of my injection I woke up with extreme left arm and scapular pain.  It radiated down to my fingers.  It all was heavy and number and tingling.  That continued most of the day.  The next day I was extremely fatigued and weak and stayed in bed.  I think had left ear and lymph node pain on the left side of my face and neck.  This continued for days.  By the 1 week mark after my injection, I ended up at the urgent care with facial swelling and extreme lymph node pain.  They stated it was an adverse reaction to the vaccine.  As of yesterday, I continue to have some swelling in my jaw and occipital region as noted by the PTA where I go for physical therapy.  I continue to experience extreme fatigue, worse than normal and dizziness.  My left pinky still has some tingling and vibration feeling.  I also still get cramping on this finger and on the ulnar side of my palm.

                                                At 12 hours through 16 hours after administration of the vaccine I experienced rigorous shivers, feeling freezing cold to the bone for hours and couldn&#39;t get warm (even with piles of blankets), periodic heart pain and some chest pressure, periodic knife like stabbing pain in my right knee, mild nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, severe weakness, sometimes a cough.  At 16 hours I got up to get water and had to hold onto things to keep my balance. After drinking a couple of cups of water, I turned away from the bathroom sink and lost consciousness, fainting and falling onto my bathroom floor. The jolt of the fall woke me up and it took a lot of strength to get up. The symptoms were vicious. When I fainted, the brunt of my weight must of been on my upper left rib cage. My ribs were so sore for a week. It was difficult to walk, breath, blow my nose, or cough.  My health provider recommended a Tylenol regime for pain control so that I could take deep breaths and prevent pneumonia. I had a low grade fever of 99 degrees F for one to two days following the vaccine. During the week that followed I felt periodically very ill, had a constant headache for a day or two, and had extremely foggy thinking and sometimes confusion.  I was very fatigued all week long. I lost my appetite and have still not gained my typical appetite back. Day 8 to 9 is when I was finally feeling closer to normal. Today I feel I may be back to 100%, but my rib cage is still healing, either from a contusion, fracture, or break (likely a contusion).

I was transported to a clinic. There I had a heart rate of 140 with irregular beats. Continued feeling of doom. An EKG showed ST depression. Symptoms improved with nitroglycerin. The clinic didn&#39;t have the technology to provide care so I was emergently transported again. At that hospital my D-dimer was positive and that lead to a CT Angiogram. This showed a pulmonary embolism. Doppler studies of both legs were negative. I was placed on Heparin for several hours and then switched to Eliquis. About 6 hours after being on Eliquis I had the exact same original symptoms and again nitro was given which helped the symptoms. I was placed back on Heparin for a longer period of time. Once I was anticoagulated I was then switch to Eliquis 10mg BID for 7 days then 5mg BID for 6-9 months. I had a CT Angiogram of the head and neck which was normal. At this time I still have dizziness with standing and intermittently with sitting, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath.

                                                After the vaccination, I felt a little dizzy waiting in the parking lot and had a sore arm, but felt fine otherwise.  (12:00-1:00 pm)  After returning home, I felt increasingly tired and warm.  I laid down  and took my temperature after walking the dog around 3:00 pm.  My temperature read 99 degrees.   I drank a lot of pedialyte to hydrate.  Throughout the afternoon, I felt sluggish and the glands seemed to swell up on the side of my neck. I also got a headache.   My temperature dropped down to 98.7 before I went to bed, but this morning, my glands under my jawline are a bit more swollen and I still have a slight temperature; 98.9 degrees.  My eyelids are puffy and I feel a little feverish, but it is tolerable.

                                                After onset at 6:45, fever rapidly increased to over 102 by 8pm.  Muscle aches and soreness accompanied fever.  Very thirsty.  Fever stayed near 103 overnight until I took tylenol somewhere between 2-4 am.  By 5 am the fever was down to 101.5.  Fever stayed between 101-102 most of the following day (4/6/2021), dropping to 99.5-100 around  6pm.  Stayed low grade under 100 through the night and was back to normal by the morning of 4/7/2021.  I felt mostly normal on 4/7/2021 aside from severe muscle tightness in gluts, hamstrings, and thighs, with soreness in my lower back (unknown if that is related to the vaccine, but it was not present before 4/7/2021).  Today, 4/8/2021 the muscle tightness &amp; soreness remains but the fever is still gone and I feel otherwise normal.

Patient was still able to drink water normally and talk normally. She didn&#39;t feel her breathing was affected, although she noted she felt her heart was racing as she was becoming more anxious. No treatment was administered. Patient stayed approx 45 minutes after shot and reported she felt fine at the 45 minute mark and was able to leave.

                                                About six or seven hours after the shot I started to feel bad, first some in my chest, then a scratchy throat with swollen glands, then mild body aches.   The next day the sore throat was gone, and body aches got worse. All my joints ache. I felt chilled in spite of outdoor temperature of 79, and a hot bath, blankets and sitting in front of a fire. It was 74 inside the house. I started to get a bit of a headache but it never developed into a full headache. At about 6pm (day 2) I started to get  hot. Anything touching my skin bothered me.   At about 7pm (day 2) I took two Tylenol and the symptoms improved by about  8:30pm.

                                                About 10-11 hours after receiving the vaccine began to have severe body aches and 102 fever.   Fever subsided but extreme fatigue and body aches for two full days following the vaccine.  Two days after the vaccine I began to have sharp intermittent pains in my head and lost my balance and had trouble walking for about two hours.  I took Advil for the fever and the pains in head and this seemed to help with both.  Three days after the vaccine I am feeling less fatigue and body aches have improved.

                                                Vaccination was 10:30 am.  Around 6:30 pm, my right knee started to throb.  I took an epsom salt bath, where my upper back started to hurt.  I went to sleep around 8:00.  I woke up around 10 pm unable to open my eyes all the way.  I believe they were swollen nearly shut.  I could see a slit of light coming in from outside.  I couldn&#39;t move my left hand at all (left arm is where I received vaccination).  I held it up to the outside light, and it was swollen.  The light coming in from outside hurt my eyes.  I couldn&#39;t see enough to call for help.  Around 1:30 a.m., the swelling went down enough for me to open my eyes.  I have never seen them look so bloodshot.  It was scary.  I could move my hand again as well.  I spent next day in bed resting.   Monday, I noticed a small rash on my right shoulder.  I went to work and was there about 20 minutes before I started feeling hot and dizzy.  I went home and spent the day in bed.   I was able to go to work the next day, Tuesday, without problem.  One week after vaccination, the rash on my shoulder went away, but a small rash broke out on my right shin.  This one was deeper.  One week later, there are just a couple of small scabs left in the spot on my shin.  I feel my energy level is close to normal.

She drank some water and then we took her blood pressure. she started to feel better and then felt a tighness in her neck. I retook her blood pressure and it was elevated. She then began having the chills, upon the last reading of blood pressure we call emergency services because it was elevated again. The last time we took her bp before emergency services came the reading was better. Ems checked her vitals and after a while let her decide whether or not she needed to go the hospital. She chose to leave and her son drove her home.

                                                Primary concern: Change in tongue taste of food and drink. Janssen-reported side effects of sore arm increased from 4/4-4/7 then subsided. Mild intermittent headache behind forehead began one minute after injection and continued 4/4-4/7. Fatigue onset 4/4 lasting thru 4/6. Then on 4/7 late morning I realized everything I ate and drank tasted differently by approximately 75%. This continued to this date (4/8) although now taste change is approximately 50%.

No treatments yet....but if still bad after this weekend, will seek medical help.  Left eye swelling started at 2pm today, with pain. the eye lid and the area around the left eye are painful and swollen. I have been using hot compresses.  Difficulty catching my breath today durning a morning walk. I have been walking for months on the same path and can hold a conversation, but today, I could barely walk and talk. Once I stopped talking I eventually was able to catch my breath, but we had to walk a much slower pace as well.

                                                I had the vaccine at approximately 7:35 AM and by 1:30 PM I was not running a temperature, however, it felt like my insides were going to burn as my core felt like it was on fire. I still feel like more core is on fire, but it has subsided and is less concerning as it was on Friday, 3/26/2021, and Saturday, 3/27/2021  My eyes became sensitive to light on Friday, 3/26/2021 night and my eyes are still sensitive especially to artificial lighting. Natural light hurts as well but is more tolerable.  My heart rate definitely increased Friday, 3/26/2021 through Saturday, 3/27/2021 however I did not experience the other symptoms on the critical list (such as inability to breathe) therefore did not go to the hospital.  I suffered from muscle weakness on Friday, 3/262021, and Saturday, 3/27/2021. The muscle weakness was only in my legs.

                                                Very painful injection! I felt this going in immediately. Probably 30 minutes after I also felt a little dizzy but I also have a chronic condition called vestibular migraine. I was fatigued later in the evening. Had full day on day after vax  because I already had things on my calendar but was dragging by the time I got home. Aches all over especially joints, head and injection site was warm to touch and somewhat swollen. Also started running fever one day after. Highest temp 101.9 . I also started having diarrhea, full on three days after. My taste and smell had been off since having covid in august, but I swear they are since taking vax. Today is Tuesday so I&#39;m now five days in and temps normal today. My body aches are also improved but my head is still a bit achy.

                                                4/6/21 I awoke with symptoms of numbness/paralysis on left side of face limited to  upper lip and cheek area and both eyes would not stop watering. Movements to drink or make facial expressions were limited due to the numbness.  Because I have sensitive skin  I thought I may have had some type of reaction to something. So I waited to see if it would clear up through the day. I was not experiencing any other symptoms. By that evening it was apparent that I was not getting better and possibly getting worse because I began to experience some noticeable drooping in my cheek area. I decided to call my doctor in the morning. Because I am currently out of town, my home doctor suggested I see a local ER to rule out a stroke and determine if I was experiencing Bell&#39;s Palsy. I went to an ER clinic on 4/7/21

Had severe headache from the left ear to the right ear and going up around my forehead, as if my head was in a vise - all day. Heart was racing all day and night, couldn&#39;t sleep on my side because of it. around 24 hours after the shot I felt chest heaviness, which went away after a few minutes. Face was flushed, and I felt clammy. Went to the bathroom more than normal.  Aches  and joint pain, which weren&#39;t too bad. When I woke up the next day, symptoms were gone, except my arm was still sore and had slight fatigue.

After some time I felt like the lower part of my face went numb and it took tremendous effort to move my lips to talk.  At that point, the medical called the ambulance and sent me to ER, where I was under supervision for some time. I was very weak and nauseated. After I was released, I was very weak could not keep the vertical position.  The next day I was very nauseated, with awful tinnitus, lightheadedness, and weakness. Staying vertical for more than 15 minutes brought fainting symptoms.  I was not able to get out of the house to work.  The next day the fainting symptoms disappeared, everything else continued. Too weak to go to work.  I started moving about only on the 4th day after the shot.  During this event, I did not have any fever or muscle ache, no virus0tyle symptoms.

                                                It wasnt until around 11pm that I started feeling bad. I was getting hot, confused a little uncomfortable or agitated, then I went to bed. I woke in the middle of the night in a crying fit because I thought I was going to die I felt soooo bad ! It was worse than any flu Id ever had! My joints hurt, my head wanted to explode , fever of 101.3 , breathing issues , exhaustion, thirsty...this lasted 2 to 3 days. Ive had a couple of days here in beginning of april til now of waking up feeling sick again. It doesnt last all day. Sometimes it just before bedtime. I guess I just feel a bit sick, but that could also be the cancer that ive had since july 2020 that hasnt been treated by a health care system I have?

                                                Janssen CFOVID-19 Vaccine EUA I have had tinnitus for about 7 years.  It developed following an ear infection.  It&#39;s been at a manageable level for several years.  I started noticing that the noise in my ear was stronger/more noticeable/more annoying a couple of days after being vaccinated.  The noise actually woke me up out of my sleep.  I have to sleep with a sound machine and the sound machine is no longer masking the noise.  It has been about 10 days and the intensity level has not abated.

                                                About 35 minutes after injection had swelling of tongue and face, tingling lips and pressure felling just above collar bone on throat. I took benadryl as soon as I felt tongue swelling , but it did not stop the advancement of more swelling in my tongue. Eventually I got throbbing jaw pain from the pressure of my tongue.

She said she tasted metallic and tingle in lips/mouth so she drove back to the store and came inside. We gave her 50mg diphenhydramine PO. She had BP of 178/96 and pulse 107.  She seemed to calm down but we had already called paramedics. They arrived and she became frantic and asked for EpiPen. They monitored her EKG and asked her many questions. She demanded to go to the ER so they put her on a stretcher and left.  Her pulse did get up to 150 when she was most frantic however her oxygen saturation stayed 100% through entire time. She was instructed to slow her breathing and remain calm.

She stated that the facial symptoms started mid morning today on 4/5/21.  Last week ( week of 3/28 to 4/3) she reports that she felt &#34;weird&#34;.  She felt as if there were cool water running under her skin at all times.  She also states that when anything touches her skin, it feels very cold.  For example, when running her hands under warm water, it feels like ice water on her hands.  When setting her bare arms on her desk, it feels as if they are being set on ice and when her pants rub against her legs it feels as if they are wet and cold.  She also stated that the top 1/3 of her back was tingly and felt as if she had applied Biofreeze to it, but she had put nothing on her back.  Her tip of her tongue feels as if it is &#34;burnt&#34; and she can not tasted anything on the front part of her tongue.  She needs to get things way in the back of her mouth before she can taste them. On 4/3/21 she states that her lips began tingling as if they were having numbing medication wearing off from a dental visit, but she had done nothing different.  On 3/31 her lower back also felt as if it had a pinched nerve.  Today on 4/5/21 she has the Bell&#39;s Palsy on her face that started mid morning and she complains of her nose feeling tingly also.  She also feels as if she is retaining fluid.

                                                I experienced body aches, headache, anxiety in my chest (once), tiredness.  One other thing that happened that may not be related is that my secondary implant eye socket became very sore and swelled up.  It could of been for another reason but the timing was uncanny.  I am feeling fine now and none of my reactions were that troubling.  I have experienced about 3 times a sudden feeling in my  body that made me think I wonder if that was the vaccine but I am feeling great now and all is good.  Thank you so very much for all the research and production of these life saving vaccines.

ER nurse gave vaccine and 10-15 mins after vaccine pt started to feel dry mouth and felt her throat closing off. She stated she had had anaphylaxis in the past and this was very similar. Pt was given EpiPen and admitted to the ER for further treatment. Pt&#39;s symptoms slowly resolved. Pt was started on IV and given Benadryl 25mg IV and solumedrol 125mg IV. She was observed for 2 hours and had stable vitals and symptoms didn&#39;t return. She received 1 liter of fluids.

Symptoms remind me of shingles-caused neuralgia which I sometimes experience on left side. Facial tingling, feeling of tightness in muscles, including inner ear are less familiar to me. Symptoms appear to change in degree--slight to more noticeable--as this first day wears on. (Now nearly five hours since vaccine.) I have gone about day as normal, eating and exercising, drinking plenty of water.

I am still very tired and having low grade temps with sweats and chills.

                                                At the injection site - it was a little sore after about three days. A week after vaccine, it hurt to touch my eye - I thought I had pink eye but it wasn&#39;t itchy. I treated it with hot compress. I did that at least 3 times a day for two days. It was really swollen  - lower eye lid of my left eye - right in the middle of it - on the inside of the eyelid I can see a bump in the middle of it and so I was kind of pushing on my eye a little and it looked like fluid was coming out of my tear duct and so I put a hot compress on it often and it&#39;s getting a little better each day. I&#39;m 70% better.

                                                I felt fine immediately after the injection - just a little pain in the arm where I got the injection and when raising my arm. By 6:30 pm I was achy all over and my legs were aching a lot. When I went to bed around 8:00, I hurt all over (achy and flu-like feeling, but no fever). I dozed off and on and about midnight when I woke up, I had a very rapid heartbeat. This went on all night and into the morning. It was hard to get any sleep at all. When I&#39;d get up to go to the bathroom, I was slightly dizzy and unsteady on my feet. After I got up at 6:30 am, the highest my heartrate got was 113, then it finally began going down. I was still hurting all over, felt extremely tired, and now had fever - 99.8. The fever lasted off and on all day and into the next night. I was also very nauseated all day and I felt extremely bloated. I also had a bad headache. When I woke up on Friday, my fever and the headache was gone, but I felt extremely tired and weak and still nauseated. I slept most of the day and I still ached all over, but not as much. My lymph nodes were also swollen. On Friday afternoon, I walked up to the mailbox and I was winded and unsteady. On Saturday, I felt a little better, but was still extremely tired. By Saturday night, all the aches, pains and headache were back and I didn&#39;t sleep well at all. I rested most of Sunday and felt a little better Sunday evening. The aches and pains were going away, but I was still very tired and exhausted. I felt the same way when I woke up on Monday morning. It seemed like the vaccination made the aches and pains I normally had with Fibromyalgia about three times as bad as usual. And I was still very bloated feeling all over. By Monday afternoon the nausea finally went away. By Monday afternoon I was feeling a little better, but still tired. On Tuesday I felt better still and I noticed that I wasn&#39;t bloated as much. It seemed like I was getting back to normal.

It has gotten smaller but is still visible today on 4/8/21 , six days after the vaccine.  Additionally,  my lymph nodes under my left arm swelled 36 hours after the injection and were swollen for 4 days. I took two 500 mg of tylenol daily for 4 days. I was very fatigued for 48 hours 24 hours after the injection.

She desribed it as a pressure (not pain or inflammation).  We discussed treatments of ADR.  We opted to have her wait longer.  She stayed 37 min. During that time the pressure sensation moved lower in chest area and reduced in sensation.  She was feeling comfortable at that time and left pharmacy area.  RPh followed up 3/9 734 pm and she was doing well.

And then about midweek, I was starting to walk downstairs at work and I had to grab onto rails so I wouldn&#39;t fall - had become so dizzy. I tried to get into my regular doctor -  he was full until April 5. I went into walk-in clinic - I  had to grab onto a board there (dizzy) and they told me to get to ER. My heart was rapid heart beat by time I got to ER. They had to give me wheelchair so I wouldn&#39;t fall over to go into the ER room. Horrible bruising on wrist - because the first IV didn&#39;t take. They gave me a bag of fluids - and gave me Meclizine to help dizziness subside and two Tylenols for headache. I&#39;m taking 3  (per day)- 25 mg chewable HCI Meclizine. If symptoms aren&#39;t as bad I just take a half of one. Still needing the medication because I still have the pressure in the ear comes up and I need to take the Meclizine and Benadryl to get the pressure to go down.

My finger tips on my left arm went numb, same arm where I received the shot.  By the time I got home  I had a headache, so I took some tylenol.   My mouth is dry on and off. They told me to drink water and Gatorade  I slept for about 5 hours. I feel better but I still have a dry mouth.  The next morning my arm was swollen and itchy around the injection. I used an ice pack for the swelling.  About 24 hours later I was sweating on and off and my headache continued. I took another tylenol. And my body muscles were hurting.  I did not see a physician during any of the episodes.  It&#39;s the morning of March 23rd and I feel okay today.

A headache was felt all day, becoming increasingly painful as the day continued.  It was sharp, intense pain in temples, across the forehead that pounded.  Intense pain behind the eyes for 2 hours before the fever broke. I had not taken any pain or fever reliever all day - wanting to let the vaccine run it&#39;s course, however at 3:30 I took one acetaminophen tablet.  I could not take the headache anymore.  By 4:30 the headache had eased up and the fever was at 100.  By 5:30 the headache was gone, temperature was at 98. I then slept for the entire night.  The next day - no fever or pains/aches, just tired.  I felt like myself by the end of the day.

It wasn&#39;t until the past couple of days I read others with  vaccine have also had this symptom following. Still having the tinnitis today and will likely need to schedule a doctor&#39;s appointment soon, if it doesn&#39;t go away.
