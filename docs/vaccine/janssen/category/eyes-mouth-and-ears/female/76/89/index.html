I then started to have stroke like symptoms. I looked at my friends and stated that I did not know their names. I went to a walk-in clinic and then I was hospitalized for three days. My blood pressure was extremely high. All of the tests were negative for stroke and I have worn a Holter monitor. I also had Neurology, Cardiologist consult and many different medications. I have stopped taking all of those medications. I have not had any more symptoms like that since that day and it only lasted less than 15 minutes.

                                                Had noises in my ears like a clock ticking.  I have titinus but this was not a ringing noise.  A couple of weeks later I woke up with my right eyelid all swollen and bruised and went to the ER where there they did a CT scan to make sure I didn&#39;t have a blood clot and I did not.  Also my platelets were in the normal range.  It took a good week for the swelling and bruising to go down and the bruising even went down my face somewhat.  I had an appointment with my eye doctor and he didn&#39;t know why it happened, but may have had something to do with my taking low dose aspirin.  I did not have any contusion to the eye and it was not hit by anything.

I went to the ER two weeks ago but there was no concern because there were no blood clots. Now my bowel is restricted and I&#39;ve had auto-immune issue about a year and a half ago. Now just cramps and bloating. I also have a tooth that&#39;s come loose and I have a strange taste in my mouth since having the vaccine. I saw the doctor and they just called and the doctor stated that I&#39;ve continue to have problems I should consider having an ultrasound of my stomach. Also, in the past, I went to Hospital.

She wanted to go straight home.  When we got home she reported that the numbness had been felt in her head and tongue and it was a very weird feeling.  She was numb on her entire left side.  It seemed to resolve after a while.  She is still very tired and has a low heart rate, but normal blood oxygenation.  There is no visible swelling or reaction at the vaccine site. She still has some slight numbness on the left side.  She may call the doctor tomorrow if there is still some concern.

Jumped in a hot shower for 15 minutes and that went away.  I thought maybe my blood pressure had dropped too low; had same reaction when first put on too much blood pressure lowering medication.  Or sometimes allergy makes the blood pressure drop. For 24 hours after that I was on the couch or in bed lying down;  brain hurt(BAD headache), stiff neck, a big effort to lift my head off the pillow so I didn&#39;t unless I had to go to the bathroom.  I laid back down asap due to slight nausea.  No appetite. Whites of eyes were uniformly pink, eyes glassy.  3/23  Sore spot  to the touch on left temple just above the eyebrow.
