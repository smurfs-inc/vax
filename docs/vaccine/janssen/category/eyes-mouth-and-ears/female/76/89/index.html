She wanted to go straight home.  When we got home she reported that the numbness had been felt in her head and tongue and it was a very weird feeling.  She was numb on her entire left side.  It seemed to resolve after a while.  She is still very tired and has a low heart rate, but normal blood oxygenation.  There is no visible swelling or reaction at the vaccine site. She still has some slight numbness on the left side.  She may call the doctor tomorrow if there is still some concern.
