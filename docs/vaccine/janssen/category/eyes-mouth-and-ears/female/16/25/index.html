                                                Minutes after I got the vaccine I started to lose hearing in my left ear (it sounded like I was under water) which slowly spread to my right ear as well. My hands and feet went numb and I started sweating all over. I felt sick to my stomach and I felt like I was above the whole situation-- I could hear the people talking but I felt like I was somewhere else. After resting my head on the table for about 10 minutes I felt better and was able to move to a cot where I rested for another 20 minutes or so until I felt pretty much back to normal. I was treated by the medical team at the site who cleared me to go home.

Nurse saw her eyes rolling back and struggling to breath. She was placed on her side until wheelchair was brought to her side and then transferred to wheelchair and taken to the ER.  While in transit she regained consciousness and was lethargic but was responding appropriately to questions. Patient was checked by Dr.  and his review was tachycardic and mild dyspnea. Skin was pink and warm. She was taken to the ER for further evaluation.

Her symptoms included dizziness, syncope, stomach ache, foaming at the mouth, vision disturbances.  911 was called and paramedics arrived..  Her vital signs were all normal.  Patient did not wish to go to hospital, and her mother took her home.  Other pertinent information is that patient has a history of seizures and had been off of her seizure medication for 4 weeks.  I believe that I understood her mother to say that her neurologist knew she was getting the vaccine today.  Patient reported no allergies to any other vaccine, medication, or other.

About half an hour after that, had a bout of vomiting, loss of vision for about 10 seconds after standing up from bed (possibly associated with undiagnosed iron deficiency), and paleness of skin and mucous membranes.

I experienced these cold like symptoms throughout the night.  At around 6:00 am, I woke up with a very mild headache and muscle aches.   I took my temperature, and had a 101 degree Fahrenheit fever. I rested, and took my temperature multiple times that morning-- which had been gradually decreasing. At around 11:30/12:00 I experienced a sudden onset of extreme fatigue followed closely by a greatly reduced ability to hear and see, along with extreme lightheadedness and the feeling like I was going to pass out. I suddenly became cold, and my body was drenched in sweat in a matter of seconds.  I think the whole experience lasted around 10 minutes, before it eventually began to pass. I could see clearly again  and began to regain my hearing, however I still experienced some lingering auditory complications for an additional three- five minutes ( it sounded like a throbbing white noise). After that, I felt a little disoriented and tired. My aunt had taken me to Urgent Care, but they turned me away, saying I needed to go to the ER. However, by that time my symptoms had passed and I was feeling ok. So I went home and rested. By the next morning, I felt I had completely recovered

                                                She felt totally fine after the shot and many hours after.  She felt fine to go to a horseback ride lesson at 4.  Half way through the lesson she acutely felt like she was going to faint/nauseous (she had a ton to eat that day, had a bottle of water just before lesson, etc. so she knew it wasnt those kinds of things) and then had a crushing headache with a lot of &#34;pressure behind her eyes&#34;, dizziness, and a really &#34;strange&#34; feeling like out of body, bawling crying, and started FREEZING.  I got there 15 minutes later and she was under lots of blankets, white as a sheet, freezing, said her spine was sore from the top to bottom... just tons of symptoms.  When I got her, she moved to my car and had seat heater on high and I had to put all the clothes from a suitcase I had in my car on top of her bc she was so cold and her skin was burning up.  I gave her 3 200 advil and a bottle of water.  ½ hour later i had a thermometer and even after that she still had 102.3 fever.  She was rambling some nonsense and seemed very disoriented for a while. She went straight to shower and laid on the floor of the shower for ½ hour, took cold medicine, and evnetually went to sleep.  In the night she was freezing again and the fever had spiked and she took more advil.  The next day she felt much better in the morning and fine by lunchtime.  She was VERY sick/uncomfortable with basically every symptom under the sun.

She had pale blue lips, ringing in ears, changes in vision/blurry vision, she felt dizzy/light headed. The symptoms began improving at roughly 12:10 and had almost completely resolved by 12:15. I kept the patient for an additional 15 minutes for monitoring. I counseled patient on what to do if they felt as though they were going to pass out. I provided a cold compress for the back of the patient&#39;s neck, and had ammonia inhalant on standby but didn&#39;t have to use to help keep patient conscious.  By 12:30 the patient was feeling completely normal again. Her mom/stepmom was with her and was able to drive her home. I asked them to reach out in case of any other symptoms developed.

                                                The patient was sitting in the waiting area following her vaccination when shortly after receiving the vaccine, her mother flagged us down and said that she lost her vision. She was describing feeling unwell. I had her lay down on the floor in the immunization booth and her mother elevated her legs. I asked her to describe her symptoms and she said that she just saw all white. I asked if she wanted me to check her blood pressure and I had her sit up on the floor and it was low around 75/53 with a pulse of 53 but not sure how accurate it was since she was sitting on the floor. She fluctuated from starting to feel better and feeling unwell again and her vision going out again. I asked if they wanted me to call 911 and her mother said she wasn&#39;t sure what to do, if she should take her to an urgent care. I said that it would be best if she was seen in an emergency room where they can better respond to this kind of situation. The patient was able to get up and walk with her mother&#39;s assistance. I was going to help walk her out but she said that she was okay walking out with her mother&#39;s help. About 10 minutes later, I called the patient to see how she was doing. Her mother said that she was doing okay and that they were on their way to the hospital just to make sure that she was checked and everything was okay.

I couldn&#39;t get a reading on the BP monitor at that time as it was too low to read and she couldn&#39;t move her limbs. While waiting  for EMS she could breathe fine, I could feel a faint pulse, but I had to keep taping her leg and talking to her to keep her awake. She was able to tell us her name and how many fingers I was holding up. I kept trying to get her to squeeze my hand, but I could only feel the tips of her fingers twitching and the whole time she was unable to move her feet/toes. I was able to look at her HR on her watch right before EMS arrived and it was at 62 and by that time her body temp seemed to be back to normal as her Mom said she felt cool and clammy. The BP reading by EMS was 100/60 and they tried to get her to stand but she couldn&#39;t and she still kept wanting to roll her head back and sleep.

Roughly an hour to an hour and a half later, the chills/shaking stopped, only to be replaced by a fever. My temperature shot up, my ears began to ring, and my head began to pound. When I tried to eat, I felt sick to my stomach.   My fever lasted for the entire evening, and I spent most of the night alternating between chills and heat flashes. My head continued to pound, and whenever I tried to sit up, I felt dizzy. At around 4am, I awoke with an upset stomach, diarrhea, and further dizziness.   By around 8-9am, my fever had subsided, and I was beginning to feel a bit better. However, I have been feeling physically drained and a little achy today (03/26).

Her eyes rolled back, stiff arm, and she urinated herself. Her mom was holding her hand and after a few seconds, she was able to talk and said that she thought that she fell asleep for a few seconds. We called an ambulance and they are taking her to the hospital for a CT scan.

                                                Patient became dizzy and lightheaded shortly following vaccination. Other symptoms included paleness, partial loss of consciousness, momentary loss of vision, diaphoresis and slurred speech. Patient was given a cold compress for the back of her neck, some peanut butter crackers to eat and water to drink. She had not eaten anything today with the exception of candy and coffee. Feet and legs were elevated and patient began to regain some color in her face and started feeling better after a few minutes.

It started off with a slight headache and body aches with pain in my injection spot. My whole body started to shiver uncontrollably. My body aches focused on my spine and I started to become dizzy and nauseous. Around 4:00 am, the worst migraine, I have ever had that encased my whole head, lasted for about 12 hours with hot flashes. After the migraine, my body and head is sensitive to rapid motion and loud noises.

                                                Within the hour after receiving shot, migraine formed along with fatigue. Both progressively got worse through out that day(4/7/21). On 4/8/21 I woke up many times through out the night with a migraine that felt as though my brain was burning and sinus pressure, causing immense eye sensitivity. Throughout the night I became increasingly more sweaty, but didn?t have the proper thermometer to take my temperature.  I took ibuprofen (at 6:45 AM on 4/8/21) which helped those two side effects subside (around 8 AM). Fatigue has been constant throughout both days. Around 5:00 PM on 4/8/21 I ate broccoli and rice for dinner, small amounts, and encountered bad diarrhea. It lasted for about half an hour. Migraine is reduced significantly (at 6:41 PM), but there is slight nausea, weakness, and fatigue.

I tried falling asleep but my fever got worse, chills worsened, I developed body aches, and I got a massive headache. I ended up not being able to get any sleep at all during the entire night because I was in so much pain. I felt tightness in my chest, stomach pains, super sore joints, and my body aches and headache kept getting worse and worse. When I got up to go use the bathroom I could barely walk because I felt so weak and was super dizzy. Later into the night my legs felt like pins and needles as if they were starting to go numb. I still have a fever, body aches, and a headache.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Immediately after getting the vaccine, I experienced severe nausea for 10-20 minutes. I experienced no symptoms for 3-4 hours afterward, but then began to develop a low-grade fever,  muscle aches, a headache, and became nauseous again.  Around 12 hours after getting the vaccine, I developed a fever of 102 F, I began to experience severe muscle aches and cramps in my calves and abdomen. I also began to develop a much worse headache and lost partial vision in my right eye for a few hours. This is when I became violently nauseous, but I was unable to throw up, or defecate.  I was unable to sleep during this time, and at 2 am, my nausea peaked, and I threw up incredibly violently and incredibly suddenly. It was so violent, it caused me to pop a blood vessel in my eye, and gave me a sore throat. However, after throwing up, most of nausea subsided.  At this point, the vision began to return to my eye. 20-40 minutes after throwing up, I began to experience chills that lasted for up to an hour. Eventually, I slept at 4 am, but slept fitfully, and woke every 40 minutes to 2 hours.  At 7 am on the 9th, the nausea was completely gone the day after my vaccination, but the muscle aches and headaches were back. My fever was down to 101, and I took some Tylenol and slept fitfully until 2 pm when I woke up feeling significantly better.

                                                I woke up with a headache at 7:30 am and a dry mouth. I got out of bed to get my water bottle, which exacerbated the headache. I tried to go back to sleep but kept waking up to drink water every half hour or so, until 10:18 am. I got out of bed to fill my now-empty waterbottle. The headache rotated and became more intense as I got up. I could only walk very slowly and tried to keep my eyes closed. Around 12:00 pm I took one tylenol. The headache is still present. It is not located in any specific part of the brain but moves around depending on if I&#39;m sitting, standing, or laying down. During that time I also felt nauseous, but I no longer do.

I had taken Advil at 8:30 and my temperature was still 100.5. (I kept taking Advil and my temp remained at 100.5.) The pain in my head was the worst I had ever felt and was intense and stabbing .I had waves of  nausea, and had extreme chills. I had severe hot and cold flashes. I also had a stomach ache.  I tried to watch TV but it was too painful. I was really scared and I did not think the night would end.

Head pain progressed and got worse and worse. A fever was present by 3am (99.0) and went up every hour reaching the highest of 102.7. I experienced violent chills and shaking, extreme nausea, extreme muscle aches and pains, extreme light sensitivity, dizziness, lethargy, and extreme weakness. I took extra strength Tylenol every 6 hours to control fever and other symptoms. All symptoms subsided within 24 hours, except for headache, tiredness and aches and pains. All symptoms went away by 8pm on 4/13/2021.

                                                A few hours after I got home from getting the shot, my lower body started to ache super bad. My skin started to hurt like I had rug burn, but I wasn&#39;t surprised because that happens to me when I get the flu. My legs and groin region started to hurt more and more and I got the chills. It was extremely bad and I was sort of writhing but I told myself I was overreacting. At around 8 or 9, I decided I would sleep it off and went to bed. At 1:00 am, I got up to use the bathroom and I began feeling lightheaded. I thought I had just stood up to fast so I continued. As I walked, i got more and more dizzy and I couldn&#39;t hear well. When I sat on the toilet, I realized I wasn&#39;t going to be able to get back up, so I sat and waited. I started to get super hot so I took my shirt off. I finally was able to get up and walked towards the sink but I collapsed before I got there. I started drinking the sink water and ran my shirt under the water and put it on my head to cool off.  This really helped so I went back to my room to call my mom. I have never fainted before or come this close to fainting. For the rest of the night I had the worst migrane of my life that gave me aura in my left eye and made my left arm and left side of my face go numb, as well as pulsing in my head. The pain on my skin, and in my legs and head was still there for two days after but it was manageable enough for me to go about my day. I tried to exercize to ease the muscle pain but this did not work.

                                                Pt&#39;s throat and tongue and jaw felt like it was swelling. She had extreme pain in her arm and her hands started swelling. She got a rash on her arms and on her hands. I took her to the urgent care facility and they gave her a shot of Decadron and a shot of Benadryl. They also Prescribed steroids. She was very sick like she had a severe flu. I was very worried as her mother. She was weak and slept constantly. Her arm could barely move and It almost appears as if she had had a stroke. She had brain fog and she wasn&#39;t remembering her days like she was missing memory. After five days, the reaction started up again so we took her to the emergency room. They did a variety of tests including a urinalysis, CT of the brain, ECG 12 lead, peripheral venous duplex of her upper arm. Everything checked out OK so they put her on more steroids and sent her home. Pt is still having arm pain a month later but finally feels better.

The lightheadedness was such that my heart was pounding, vision was lost for a second (similar to the effect when you stand up too fast), and the sound went out for a second. Around 7:00 I got chills, a 101 degree F fever, and headache. The chills, fever, and headache lasted throughout the night, but they were gone in the morning. The entire day after getting the vaccine, 4/1/2021, I had a metallic taste in my mouth. By the morning of 4/2/2021 the metallic taste was gone.

My jaw was smacking the entire time, so hard that the headboard smacked against the blinds. Then I checked my temperature and it had gone from 97.5 to about 99.5. The symptoms got worse, and added in excessive thirst, pain at the base of my head where it meets my neck, pressure under and behind the eyes, severe lower back pain, muscle pain escalating on the right side of my body only, nausea, pain across the top of my forehead, and a weird heat sensation under my fingernails? Maybe and hour or so passed, and my fever rose to above 101, and I tried to go back to sleep. By this point the tremors were over, but slight chills and every other symptoms remained. I took my temp later and it was 102.7, and I again had all symptoms except the initial tremors. I also had tachycardia (super rapid heartbeat) and got dizzy for a second and have a little trouble focusing my vision when I sat up in bed.

We called 9-1-1 to check vitals and they recommended going to her doctor or the hospital in case of additional swelling.  We called the doctor and they told us to try Benadryl.  This worked a little bit, but she is still in a lot of discomfort today (Saturday after Thursday shot).

At around 3:00 pm on April 8, I began to develop a fever which first started at 100 degrees Fahrenheit. By around 5:00 pm, the fever had progressed to 102 degrees Fahrenheit, and the 700mg of Tylenol I had taken was not breaking the fever. I started to get body chills, muscle pain, joint soreness, and cold sweats. Again, Tylenol was not helping. I had no appetite and was having trouble keeping fluids down. Around 11:00 pm on April 8, I took more Tylenol and the fever began to break but did not fully break until 36 hours after the vaccination. It is now April 10 and I am starting to feel like myself again, but for a full 36 hours the pain was so intense that even a light sheet covering my body was painful.

I waited at my vaccination site for about 30 minutes after that. My vision was blurring and turning black and white and my hearing went out. I felt lightheaded and fainted for a few seconds. Afterwards, I was lightheaded for quite some time and my blood pressure was a bit low.

                                                Started out with a headache and dizziness within a few minutes of the vaccine, along with nausea. I stayed put laying down with a lollipop and water bottle along with ice packs on me for about an hour until I was well enough they thought for me to drive back to my dorm. Once I started driving the headache was back but I was driving so I couldn?t do much. Almost pulled over because I was getting over whelmed but ended up making it back to my dorm. Once I got back I changed and laid down in bed hoping to fell better. Things started getting worse from there. Throughout the rest of the day my head ache and dizziness got worse to the point where I was pretty unsteady on my feet. Chills and body aches also started and progressed rapidly despite no fever.  My nausea was present in waves but eventually dissipated around 8 PM.  I tried to go to bed around 11 hoping to sleep off the symptoms. I began tossing and turning. My chills were really bad and it got to the point where my skin was so sensitive that the clothes I was wearing touching and rubbing against my skin were hurting me. I was so dizzy and light headed to the point where it didn?t matter if I was laying down or sitting up, I felt the same, extremely dizzy and lightheaded as if cotton were in my brain or as if it were working too slow. It was like trying to process thoughts through molasses. Then around 1:30 I couldn?t take it anymore and thought maybe a quick shower would help me to at least feel better so I could sleep. When I got in the shower I immediately knew things were worse.  My vision started going black at the edges and black spots in the middle to the point where at certain moments I couldn?t see. I was fighting to stay on my feet and conscious and it was hurting to breathe. I knew I needed to get help so I stumbled to my dorm and collapsed when I got in the doorway to my room. My vision was spotty, my chest was hurting and I could barely breathe.  My hands and feet went numb as well, I was shivering, and my body temperature was a little down to about 98.1 degrees Fahrenheit.   I was transported to a hospital via ambulance my vitals were normal except elevated heart rate and O2 and  was admitted at 2:40 in the morning. I received a chest x ray and  my heart rate was better.  The dizziness was under control by then. I was discharged at 4:50 in the morning.

                                                Johnson and johnson covid-19 vaccine eau  March 20th - allergic reaction to covid vaccine Johnson &amp; Johnson. Allergic reaction started approximately 2 minutes after receiving shot. It started with itching and redness on my arms and upper chest. After approximately 10 minutes, I knew something was wrong and I signaled an attendant. They immediately brought me over to the EMTs on site, where they looks me over and started drawing up IV Benadryl. In the time it took for them to draw up IV Benadryl and insert the IV, the hives on my chest started to turn into burning and ice sensations intermittently. As soon as they administered the IV Benadryl, the itching redness and hives on my arms went away within a couple minutes, and I was left with only redness on my upper chest. They felt comfortable with me getting a ride to the ER from my dad and not getting emergency transport. At the ER, they gave me pepcid and prednisone. About an hour and a half later, I started developing chest tightness and hives and redness on the side of my face. They decided to administer more Benadryl and start epinephrine. I was discharged a couple hours later.  March 22nd - I went back to the hospital, with complaints of severe stomach pain. The stomach pain lasted approximately 24 hours.  March 20th to march 26th - I experienced extreme fatigue. I was exhausted to the point where on Wednesday I took a ten minute shower and by the end of it I had to lay down again because I was shaking from exhaustion.  Symptoms improved slightly until April 5th where it started taking a turn for the worse.  April 5th - I started noticing black spots in my vision that wouldn&#39;t go away. They didn&#39;t move and they stayed in one spot for hours until I fell asleep and then they&#39;d be gone the next morning. They usually started around 8:00 or 9:00 at night. Sometimes a couple hours earlier. They came every day until Friday April 9th when they did not come.   April 5th to present - I also started noticing light-headedness, motion sickness when I stood still or sat in a chair, nausea, neck pain, and periods of muscle weakness in the neck. These symptoms have not stopped.  Friday April 9th around 6:45 p.m. I started having a bad migraine, I noticed in the bathroom at work my eyes were dilating over and over and over again rapidly. The pain was very high. I ended up leaving work early and going to the emergency room. While at the emergency room they treated my migraine with a cocktail of Benadryl, toradol, and compazine. It reduced the pain at the time, however it did not take away the migraine.  Friday April 9th to present - My migraine has continued from April 9th and is still happening. I have been having severe light sensitivity, sound sensitivity, and trouble reading. The rapid dilation of my eyes stopped April 10th, however my eyes stayed dilated until April 12th.  In addition to all of my other symptoms, there are others that I am not as positive are relevant. I have asthma and it has been worse over the past couple of weeks, it it is not usually worse this time of year. I&#39;ve been also been having quite a bit more light bruising than normal over the past two weeks and over the past one and a half weeks I have noticed red spots all over my skin. I was not sure if these red spots were normal or not because I do have them on occasion however these are darker than normal.

Fever decreased, but chills, headache, fatigue, and vomiting continued. Patient was forcefully vomiting bile after not being able to keep anything down. Patient broke capillaries across the face. Extreme tiredness pursued, but symptoms dwindled over the course of three days.

                                                Morning after vaccination (on 4/6/21), pt got diffuse intermittent headache which focalized later into the right temporal area daily for 3 weeks, which she calls 8/10 in severity. These headaches have been so severe to the point that it induces nausea and creates abdominal cramping. She has not as photophobic as before during her headaches, and nothing seems to alleviate it but water and tylenol (but that has little lasting effect). Prior to these headaches her migraines came once every 2 weeks and lasted 2-3 hours at a time, with a 5/10 severity that was bitemporal with more pronounced photophobia.

I was trying to go to sleep and I started with chills. I had a heating pad and 2 blankets and was still shivering, I took my temp and it was 102.4F. I took some Tylenol and was able to sleep and woke up in the middle of the night sweating. Next morning I was again with 102.7F fever. I slept most o the day, and when awake I noticed the body aches were still present. Kept taking Tylenol. Next day my left ear started feeling to hurt and it felt like fluid. I decided to go get checked and that is when they told me I had an inner and outer ear infection. After meds were prescribed (oral antibiotics and ear drops) the swelling has been going down a lot and it is not as near as painful.

It got to the point where if I did anything but lay down, I would feel lightheaded and off balance. The worst happened at 3:00 AM on 4/10/2021 (the day after) when I got up to use the bathroom. I was washing my hands afterwards and nearly passed out. I couldn&#39;t hear, I couldn&#39;t see, and it was a bit difficult to breath. Luckily I knew what all of this meant and I sat down and took deep breaths until I felt fine again.

Stayed seated until it mostly passed, then went outside for fresh air and to cool down. Put a cold rag on forehead/back of neck for half hour following symptoms. Drank water at soon as possible. For the next 36 hours after receiving the vaccine: sensitive skin, muscle weakness, tiredness, headache, body aches (including the sight of injection), chills, hot flashes. Took Advil every few hours to reduce pain, kept lights off, laid in bed to rest.

By 7 pm, the fever progressed to 103.7 deg F. By 11 pm, I started to have nausea. Throughout the night I continued to have chills and sweats with episodic vomiting. The next morning I had terrible body aches and restless leg syndrome. I still had a fever and a lack of taste. It wasn&#39;t until 48 hours after receiving my vaccine that my symptoms eventually subsided.

                                                I had the typical soreness about 12 hours after the injection. No worries there. The next morning, on the 10th, around 11:40 AM, I started feeling extremely dizzy. The room started spinning. I was standing at the time, and I kept standing, but other than that, I had no control. My hearing starting going fuzzy, starting with ringing in my ears until it sounded like I was underwater. My vision started blurring, as well, eventually going completely black. For a solid 5-10 seconds, I could neither hear clearly nor see at all. I was conscious, because I could think relatively clearly, and I could feel my eyes blinking and could wiggle my fingers, but that was it. Once the episode passed, I immediately sat down. About a minute later, I started having excruciating abdominal pain. The pain was wracking my whole body, causing me to go pale (as I later saw once I could hobble to the bathroom) and making me sweat. After about twenty minutes, the whole thing passed and I was left with minor dizziness and slight nausea. Now, three days later, I still have some of the dizziness, but none of the blindness, deafness, or pain has returned. All other side effects, such as soreness, have completely left.

                                                For thirty-six hours after the vaccine. I had body aches and chills and my eye sockets were sore and it hurt to look up. Ten days after the vaccine I was in the shower and a large blood clot came out of my nose. It was a large clot about the size of a quarter and there was no other blood with it. The clot came out of my left nostril but it was not like a nose bleed. I went to the Urgent Care but they did not do tests.

                                                I first noticed that I was extremely cold and could not get warm at about 11 pm on the evening of my vaccine. I then realized it was getting worse, and I was shivering uncontrollably despite sitting in front of a space heater in warm clothing and wrapped in a blanket. I checked for a fever, but my temp was only 99. I fell asleep around 1 am, and woke up at 5 am (3/8/21) to a splitting headache, extreme thirst, slight nasal congestion, muscle soreness, fatigue, and nausea. These symptoms feel almost identical to the symptoms I experienced when I contracted COVID-19 in September 2020 at my university.

I got up to shower and get some food as I was going upstairs I grew very faint,  my vision grew black and my hearing faded. I was able to make it to my bed then ask for some help. After taking Tylenol, my fever began to be very hot instead of chills. I was able to fall asleep until I woke back up to chills again and taking more medicine.  The next morning, I was still dizzy when I walked around but the fever was gone. I was still very fatigued which made me unable to go to class or work. Day 3 I was back to my normal self.

We applied cold clothes to the neck and head and patient felt like she was going to vomit so we also gave her a bag just in case she got sick. She started looking very pale so we layed patient on floor. She started to panic that she wasn&#39;t going to go to work and eyes were rolling in the back of head. Called 911 for patient and I stayed with patient, I took her blood pressure which was normal. Patient became fully alert again and stated she was feeling a little better. The ems checked her blood pressure and blood sugar and released the patient.

                                                The night I got my shot, my entire body was freezing and I couldn?t sleep at all because my entire body was in so much discomfort and pain, especially near my rib cage area in the front and back. The following day was the exact same, except my front rib cage didn?t hurt anymore (only the back). I was extremely fatigued and I couldn?t sit down because my body hurt so much. The worst symptoms were the sharp ear and neck pain (by the ears). It was a sharp, sporadic pain, but it still hurts a lot.  It?s now been 2 days since the shot and the neck and ear pain is now more frequent, though my fever and some of my muscle sores are now getting better. I also feel extremely nauseous, like I?m going to puke anytime soon.

                                                7:00pm- start to feel really cold, develop a high fever and chills and eventually go home to lay down.  8:30pm- uncontrollable shaking and high fever maintains and I develop I very bad migraine, I can&#39;t feel my arms or legs and everything sounds like my head is underwater (I think this might have been a migraine but I&#39;ve never had one). When I stand up my vision goes black, and I develop joint pain, muscle aches, and very bad nausea.  9:00pm - I take 500mg of aspirin and all of my syptoms persist for ~30 minutes when suddenly my fever breaks and I&#39;m sweating underneath my 3 blankets and I can think again as long as I don&#39;t move my head. Everything still sounds weird and my stomach and joints still hurt but I go to sleep. 4:00am- wake up crying from the headache and with a fever again so I take 500 more mg of aspirin and set an alarm to take more at 10am.  10:00am- I feel exhausted and really weird, I take only 250mg of aspirin and sleep the whole day.  4:00pm - I wake up feeling so much better. Kind of achy and still very nauseous, my ears still ring when I stand up.   4:00pm yesterday - now: I kept movement at a minimum and was still nauseous throughout the day but was able to eat at around 9pm. I think I may have had a low grade fever on and off last night but the headache has thankfully stayed away and other than a little bit of arm soreness and weakness I feel back to normal today.

The pain was very intense behind my left eye like there was a needle being poked in from behind.  Some nights the pain is so bad it hurts to lay my head on a pillow or I wake up all through the night because of it. I took tylenol the first 4 days then stopped. I tried to see an urgent care about it but they told me they couldn?t help me due to the vaccine type.

                                                Painful injection but fine for the majority of the day. Started feeling muscle fatigue around 4pm, with upper body aches, stinging eyes, and nausea by 6pm. Fever of 102, and progression to full body aches and headache by 8pm in addition to the aforementioned symptoms that continued throughout the night. Fever lowered to 99 and only minor body aches by mid morning on the 12th. Headache continued throughout the day with low grade fever. I predict that I will feel 100% better within 48 hours.

                                                I received the shot at 14:30, in which medical staff in the jail&#39;s medical center watched me for 20 minutes to ensure there were no immediate reactions. I went about my day afterward with no symptoms. At 21:30 when I went to sleep, I got some aches in my joints and took 1 dose of liquid capsule NyQuil to help with the pain and went to sleep. At 00:30, the 7th, I woke up groaning in my sleep to the extreme pain in my joints and feeling hot internally. I decided to get up and take a warm bath to ease the aches. I went and ran the bath and all of a sudden while it was running, I had a severe need to throw up, but could not naturally. Since this was concerning, I got up and walked out of the bathroom and all of a sudden in the hall I got a feeling of impending doom and that something was not right and I fainted. I laid on the floor for what I would approximate to be 5 minutes going in and out of consciousness waiting for the blood to fully return to the brain. After this, I instantly felt like I needed to survive and that I felt like I could be dying so I slowly crawled down the stairs to get to my military ID so I could call the military&#39;s nurse advice line. I had to take a break and lay on the concrete in my garage because I felt so dizzy and so hot and began to feel my vision disappear like I was going to faint again. I waited a few minutes before getting back up the stairs crawling to my phone to call. When I called them 00:58, they told me to call 911 because they believed I would be having a severe reaction, though I noted to them I did not have a rash or hives. I then called 911 at 01:08. They sent EMT&#39;s to my home which took my vitals. I had normal blood pressure, SPo2, and temp, but an elevated heart rate of just under 100 and a high respiration rate. EMT&#39;s made the decision for me to stay home since the hospital did not seem immediate in their opinion. After this I stayed on the couch for a few minutes and then felt very tired so I walked slowly to my room and fell asleep. I woke up at 06:00 for work, and arrived at 07:00. In the hour after waking up I was achy, sweating, and felt light headed. I got to work and my Sergeant told me to go home and sleep. I slept another 5 hours at 08:00 and when I woke up most of my symptoms went away other than aches and getting flush very easily for 5 days.  At this current time all I notice is some random light headedness that quickly resolves and comes a few times a day at random and without cause.

I noticed on Sunday I began developing some redness on the tops of my hands. On Monday morning my hands began getting a rash on the knuckles and tops of my hands. I also noticed that since being vaccinated my nipples have been erect and are tender. Today my hands are no longer displaying a redness to them but they are still itchy and the skin feels dry like Eczema, something I never have had before in my life.

                                                Immediately after receiving the shot I began to have fairly intense pain at injection site. It continued in waves. I began to walk around the store for the allotted 15 minutes. I began to feel very dizzy and faint. My ears began ringing and I didn?t feel well. I stumbled back to the pharmacy to ask for help. At this point I was also feeling like it was very hard to breathe. I explained all these symptoms to the pharmacists on duty and they told me to just sit down. After sitting down I still felt faint but suddenly felt the need to vomit. I stumbled to the bathroom where I collapsed in front of the toilet and passed out twice, striking my head and throat on the bowl. After awaking I was very disoriented and felt very hot and clammy. The pharmacist then came and found me and told me to once again sit down and continue waiting. After sitting down for about 5 more minutes I began to feel less dizzy and was having an easier time breathing. I left the store as the pharmacist was ignoring me and didn?t seem concerned about my symptoms. After arriving home I was tired and week and very very cold. I noted my body temp was lower than usual. I took a nap and then these symptoms continued for about 24 hours. I am now feeling much better.

I called the doctors and they said that was unrelated to the vaccine, but I had intense dizziness and tinnitis before I passed out. I was incredibly fatigued all day long for the rest of the day and had a migraine - both to be expected. However, I am 3 weeks post-vaccine (April 3) and have been having intense muscle cramping and fatigue in my legs during exercise. I wake up with muscle soreness that goes away throughout the day and then comes back during exercise.

                                                Patient received her Janssen COVID vaccine and was sitting in a chair in the conference room when she slumped over in her chair and became unresponsive. Patient had just received her one dose Janssen vaccine and was sitting in a chair approximately 3-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  She began to slump over in her chair and was unresponsive. Two RNs responded to assess the patient. Patients feet were elevated and ice packs applied to her neck and axillary areas. Patient was breathing and had a pulse. Patient responded to her name once and then passed out again. Patient was unable to respond after this.  Her eyes were open.  Patient was lifted into a wheelchair by three nurses and brought to a private area.  Patient was warm and sweat was running down her face.  Her sweater was removed and ice packs again were applied to her neck and axillary area.  Patient continued to have a pulse and was breathing.  EMS was called.  Patient slowly began to come around and could answer questions after about 5 minutes of being unresponsive. She was confused and had no memory of what had occurred. She reported feeling light headed and seeing spots in her vision.  She continued to feel light headed. EMS assessed patient.  Vitals were stable and blood sugar was WDL.  Patient reported feeling much better. She denied feeling light headed or dizzy any longer.  She was able to answer all questions asked.  Patient did not want to go to the hospital and refused transport to the hospital via ambulance. She was observed for an additional 20-30 minutes at which time her boss arrived to pick her up. She was educated on calling 911 if she began to feel light headed or dizzy again. Patient verbalized understanding. She was walked to the car by an RN.

                                                I started experiencing side effects about 6 hours after receiving the vaccine. I experienced chills, sweating, 99.5 fever, headache, head pounding, dizziness, nausea,  tiredness, sore body, sore left arm, and had trouble sleeping. I took two Motrin pills and felt a little better and was able to sleep. In the morning, I woke up tired, sweating, had a sore left arm and sore body so I took two more Motrin pills and am feeling mostly better. Fever, headache, head pounding, dizziness, and nausea are gone.

                                                Got the shot at 9:20am on Saturday (April 10th). By the time I sat down to do the 15min waiting period before I could leave. My arm from the back of my shoulder all the way down to around my thumb joint in my hand ached so bad. By around 3pm on the same day, I started to feel really tired and had a pounding migraine. By 4:30p I started to get really cold and everything started to ache. By 6p I was feeling hot but at the same time cold and shivering. My head was pounding. Every muscle ached all over my body, and by every muscle I mean even my eye muscles and pelvic floor muscles. My face had so much sinus pressure that it felt like it could explode. My skin, all over my body, was so sensitive that it hurt to the touch. On top of my skin being sensitive to the touch, off and on my skin would tingle, including the inside of my mouth and tongue. My lymph nodes were swollen enough in my neck that my throat ached.  I was mentally confused and shaking. Everything got bad enough I started crying and hyperventilating. I felt sick to my stomach and felt digestive pain. My entire body felt so heavy. By the time it got to around 8p, my mom finally took my temperature, which at that point I had already been taking Tylenol all day and was no longer shivering, and I had a temperature of 101 degrees F. I finally went to bed around 9p. I was thirsty but my stomach felt sick. I still ached and woke up around 10 times throughout the night either feeling too hot or cold or hurting so bad. At 4am I took a Tylenol because it everything hurt bad enough to able to fall asleep. The next day. I mostly better. I was still tired and a little achy and my lymph nodes under my arm pits were swollen. At this point my lungs felt strange. Harder to breathe than normal.  I was starting to cough. The day after that (today) I have felt fairly normal except I?m coughing and my lungs still feel a little strained. No more aches or fever or anything like that though.

                                                I was running on the treadmill and all of the sudden my feet started tingling. I got off the treadmill to try to massage my feet. Then, I felt nauseous and vomited. After vomiting I could not move and I had very hard time walking. I noticed that my face had swollen, my throat was closing, and my vision was blurry. I also broke out in hives. Once I could get mobile (about two hours after the adverse reaction started) I took a Benadryl and that helped ease the swelling.

                                                Within seconds of receiving the vaccine I began to feel slightly dizzy. By the time I walked across the room to the observation table I was feeling lightheaded. They sat me down, gave me water and a cookie, but about 2min after the injection the dizziness was so intense that I began to black out. I was unconscious for about 1-2min, then came to but my vision was still unclear. I was taken via wheelchair to the paramedics on the opposite end of the gymnasium, and at this point I was heavily perspiring and very pale but still coherent. I felt my vision and dizziness significantly improve after being able to lay down. I was transported to the hospital for observation but had much improved by the time I arrived. An EKG, bloodwork, and cardiac tests were recommended to discern possible underlying heart related conditions, but I declined because I already had a PAT for thyroid surgery scheduled the next day that would be running those same tests. This reaction was likely due to not having eaten  for several hours prior to the vaccine. After about an hour I felt well enough to drive myself back home and dealt with mild aches and pains that evening, chills, and a low grade fever all of which resolved themselves by the next morning.

                                                I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine at 8:30AM on Friday, March 26. The only symptoms I experienced until that evening were mild soreness at the injection site, mild stiffness/soreness in my left arm and my neck, and mild body aches. At 6:00PM that day, I was driving and experienced sudden-onset nausea and dizziness. I experienced tunnel vision and my vision began to black out. I was able to pull off the road and began retching and dry heaving. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my lips and then in my right hand, each of which lasted for about a minute. The nausea lasted for 5-10 minutes, after which it dissipated and I started experiencing chills. After returning home, around 9:30PM I experienced a severe headache and a return of sudden-onset nausea. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my right hand again, which disappeared after about 5 minutes. I retched and dry heaved again, and I took two Advil. The nausea passed and I was able to go back to sleep. The next morning, the nausea had completely disappeared,  and the only lingering symptoms were a mild headache and mild stiffness/body aches.

                                                ?Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine?  Approximately 5 hours after recieving the vaccine I started feeling extremely tired and cold despite the climate being warmer than usual. I went to sleep and woke up shivering, i was cold but my body was burning to the touch. My body ached and I had a headache and nausea. My eyes hurt whenever I moved them. These symptoms persisted until 9:18, I took 2 tylenol pills and started feeling better. Today is my third day, my eye pain has not gone and I still feel tired but what is bothering the most is the eye pain whenever I look anywhere or move my head.

                                                The first symptom was a pounding headache which got progressively worse and was also the longest lasting symptom. Fever of 102.5 degrees. Fever lasted approximately 12 hours, and included heavy chills and sweating. Extreme fatigue, weakness, and dizziness. Metallic taste in mouth. Body aches, and especially soreness in the left arm (injection site). Loss of appetite. By 24 hours after the vaccine injection, almost all symptoms were gone, but soreness in left arm persisted. About 26 hours after the vaccine, I had extreme acid reflux which lasted a few hours. In the two days since the vaccine I&#39;ve experienced a ringing in my left ear.

About an hour later my entire body was aching and I couldn&#39;t stop shaking with chills. I couldn&#39;t move or turn in my bed without my entire body just hurting. Even the blankets and clothes I had on were hurting my body. I tossed and turned throughout the night. At midnight I woke up to use the bathroom and my face and eyes were hurting. Once I got into my bathroom and looked in the mirror, my face was a little swollen and my eyes were a little puffy. My forehead and cheeks were a little red so I took my temperature and I was running a fever of 102.

                                                About 7 minutes of receiving my J&amp;J vaccine, I started to feel nauseous while sitting down and waiting for my fifteen minutes of monitoring. I experienced pain in my left arm and my heart was beating fast. My vision was in and out, started seeing black and white spots. I then got up from my chair and I went to the counter and as I was talking to the clerk telling her I did not feel good, I just went down and fainted. I had fainted and when I came back, woke up a nurse was trying t put an epi-pen on me but I told her I did not need it. They called the ambulance and they monitored me there. The EMT said to me that my blood pressure had dropped and I had had a &#34;vasovagal syncope&#34; and that my body probably went into shock. I did not go to the hospital and went home. For the rest of the day I felt ill, and out of it. I also felt pain, an aching pain to the right buttocks region. The next day I still felt not good. Also I have noticed since the J&amp;J vaccine, I had my menstrual cycle but normally my menstrual cycle lasts 5 days now this month it only lasted about 4 hours and I this concerns me.  Before this vaccine, I did not have experience these symptoms.

                                                Night of vaccine had severe body aches, back pain, leg pain severe until legs went numb, then arm pain severe until also numb, chest pains/ trouble breathing.  Following days had pains in arms and legs as if a tourniquet was left on and I cycled through severe pain and being numb. 5 days in I lost my vision (super blurry and seeing double) and lost complete control of arms and legs on top of headache and chest pains. Vision came back a couple hours later but the leg pains/ numbness continued even now. It feels as if my circulation has been cut off.
