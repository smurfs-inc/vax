As of 12:30pm on 3/10, some minor symptoms are still present, such as muscle weakness and pain, severe migraine, and dizziness.

                                                Hi, I received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine one week ago, Thurs March 11. On friday, I experienced the typical flu like symptoms - chills aches pains and fever. These have slowly gone away, but a week later I still have chills and constantly shake, and diarrhea. The most significant side effect I want to report is extreme vertigo and dizziness and headaches. These have been present for a week now and have prevented me from working and doing daily activities. I constantly feel like Im going to fall over and cannot see clearly. I previously had vestibular migraines, but these have been mostly gone due to going to the chiropractor and taking my supplements. The vaccine brought them back now in full force. I read that this is becoming a commonality among other people and need answers on this. I want to make sure its not permanent or that I will have this as a serious side effect.

I came out of it within 10 minutes. 16 hours later I had a 102 fever. Took Tylenol Felt fine 24 hours later 32 hours later I started to get a headache and light sensitivity. Fever back to over 99- low grade for me.  35 hours later I had such a bad headache and light sensitivity. I couldn?t watch tv, be on my phone, or look at a computer screen. I also started to get bouts of nausea. 38 hours later, I vomited for the first time. Same symptoms as what I described last. 42 hours later, I vomited again. 48 hours later - 5 days later, light sensitivity and  migraine symptoms continued , but improved slowly each day.               6 days later, all previous symptoms were gone. I woke up with a bump in my inner eye. Slowly went away throughout the day, then developed a itchy, red bump in between my lips and nose, that progressively got bigger throughout the day and made my lip swell. Bump was about 2 inches in diameter at its biggest. Took Claritin, cleaned face with alcohol, and by 24 hours later it was not noticeable.  8 days later, the bump appeared again in between lip and nose on the opposite side of my face.  Took Benadryl, bump slowly went down throughout the day. By 24 hours later it was gone

Inexplicable fear of being paralyzed and dying ( somewhat delirious overnight)- inability to sleep the evening after the shot.  The full day after the vaccination, body temperature rose--couldn&#39;t stop sweating and had a searing headache. Took tylenol to reduce the symptoms.   The following day (today) had severe dry mouth and very sore throat. Felt about 60% back to normal health. I am a very fit 26 year old (run and exercise daily)

Felt lightheaded, dizzy, and hot. I began to black out, so I sat down, which helped for a few moments to subside lightheadedness. I was still feeling hot, so I walked a few feet to my back door and sat down on the steps outside to cool off. Within minutes, my vision blurred completely, I saw stars, and completely blacked out. My mother, who was nearby, heard me fall on the steps. She said my eyes rolled back, my body was completely limp, I was not breathing but rather making gurgling noises from my throat. She propped my head up, which allowed me to breathe properly, and I came to.   If my mother had not been nearby, I am convinced I would be dead right now. I saw the light, saw the other side, saw my relatives. I have had a near death experience once before, and this was exactly like that.

As of today (4/12/2021) I am still feeling extremely anxious (as if my anxiety medicine is not working at all) and have headaches and trouble focusing or remembering things, making it very difficult to work. Also having trouble sleeping because of the anxious feeling.

                                                Lost vision like 3 mins after vax at the drive through shot center, paramedics were with me for about 20 mins to  make sure blood pressure was okay and vision was 100% better. Besides the body aches and diarrhea on 4/3 and 4/4, On 4/6 I had the worst migraine ever where I lost 1/3 of my vision for about an hour and my right side of my body went numb for about 15 mins. I&#39;ve been having migraines more frequently than I ever have and unsure if it is vaccine related or just extra stress. I have been trying to reduce screen time as much as I can but hard when I work full-time and in grad school and use the computer all the time. I also have been taking motrin/tylenol for the pain and lay down to let the pain pass.

                                                Had typical post vaccine symptoms right after - nausea, muscle aches, chills, fatigue. 5 days after vaccine those appeared to have dissipated. Went for a light walk in the morning. Completely lost vision in both eyes extremely blurry. Stumbled my way home running into trees, cars. Vision came back, thought it was migraine (had them before but nowhere NEAR as bad, never had vision completely blocked)  Excurtating headache behind eyes and nausea, feels like pressure in head. Worst headache of my life, went to ER. Gave morphine (did not help pain at all which was horrifying) got a head CT scan which came out clear and discharged because clotting ruled out. It is now day 6 and my headache is persistent and still excruciatingly painful. I?m also extremely nauseous. I?m terrified because I know something is very wrong. ER doc said might be lingering side effect from vaccine but those effects felt very different.

It feels like a mild headache where moving makes it worse,  or as if I had a hangover but I don&#39;t. I feel tension in my head. Lying down makes me feel better, as does any position where I&#39;m resting my head. Yesterday I also had a weird feeling in my throat that came and went rhythmically.

The pharmacist/doctors at CVS gave me some water and told me to elevate ny legs. After 10 minutes they checked my termperature and blood pressure. I stabized somewhat and when home. I was sure it it was my nerves but something did feel right. I had a slight burning in my chest and felt queezy on/off throughout the day. Chills and hot flashes followed. I was anxious and paranoid about the possibility something serious coukd be wrong with me. I felt shooting pains in my lower left abdomen that nught and the next day. The following day I still felt very weak. My arm hurt. My muscles felt like jello and I?m unhappy. I wish I never got the shot and I?m worried about my body?s reaction to it.

Saw black dots, pain spread from arm to chest, got up to let the pharmacist know woke up on the floor shaking, head felt like it was bleeding but I didn?t hit me head.  Saw black spots and waves of blur in my vision for hours.  Meds came decided to observe at home.  Did NOT have anxiety.  I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks I am well aware of the feelings, coping techniques etc that come with them.   Now I have major anxiety that I got a injected with some that may hurt me.

                                                At 10pm on 5/18/2021 I started having side effects, 9 hours after vaccination. My face and ears were hot and my body was cold, I felt very fatigued. I took Tylenol before bed and woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat. I woke up officially at 8am and felt my face and eyes were swollen, I also had chest tightness. I looked in the mirror and it looks like I was punched in the face. My left eye (the side I was vaccinated) is significantly more swollen than my right side. Since 8am, the swelling and puffiness hasn?t gone down in my face, however, the chest tightness went away. I took Benadryl. It is now almost 4pm on 5/19/2021 and I still have the same amount of swelling and puffiness in my face. It?s extreme enough that I can?t go out in public like this or else someone will think I got beat up. There isn?t any bruising, rather, under each eye there are very prominent dark circles with almost a reddish tint. It seems like this possibly could be an allergic reaction but after reading online it seems like allergic reactions would have happened right after vaccine. I noticed this side effect 19 hours after vaccination when I woke up on 5/19/2021. If it?s not better when I wake up tomorrow on 05/20/2021 I will goto urgent care.

                                                During injection, felt pins and needles from injection site to fingertips which faded to tingling and stopped entirely after about 7 minutes.   Intense nausea and sweating beginning 1-2 minutes post injection; unable to sit up. Lasted approximately 7-10 minutes before clearing up  2 hours later (7:10 pm), arm at and above injection site felt hot to the touch and had mild dull pain at every movement. Slightly dizzy and nauseous. Arm periodically ached without movement.  By 7:26 pm, arm pain from movement was a sharp pain, though still pretty mild.  Around 9:30 pm, gently pressed at site of injection and a jolt of pain went all the way down to my fingers  Nausea increased at 10:13, still mild. Decided to go to sleep. Woke up at least 5 times before 12:30 am in various states of pain and discomfort, including nausea when attempting to sit up; dry throat/mouth; pins and needles throughout my glutes and thighs accompanied by pain in my left hip, knee, ankle, and jaw; and mild to moderate arm pain at the injection site. Took about 15 minutes to be able to get up due to nausea and got some water.  Was cold so wrapped myself in a blanket. Nausea and arm pain with movement remained but I was able to go back to sleep around 1:15 am.  Woke up at 2:53 am - arm pain minimal and nausea gone, blanket felt nice but unnecessary, went back to sleep  Woke up at 5:34 am with pins and needles  in glutes and thighs and pain in my right jaw, knee, hip, and ankle (all sites of previous moderate injuries) along with a low grade headache. Went back to sleep.  Woke up after an hour or so feeling relatively normal, arm pain and headache returned after sitting up. Got out of bed but ended up taking another nap.  Woke up after another hour with just a headache and brain feeling fuzzy, but strong tingles began returning to my glutes and thighs  like they had fallen asleep (referred after this point as tingles). Arm hurt. Drank some more water and took another nap.  Woke up around 9:15 am with a low grade headache and slight tingles; fuzzy brain feeling was gone. Legs wobbly when I walked. Realized that tingling got worse anytime I was sitting down or lying on my back.  Around 10:20 am started crying - no known cause. Couldn&#39;t stop for a few minutes. This is not normal for me.  Around 1 pm realized I had a pretty high fever; unsure how high it was or how long I&#39;d had it. Took another nap at 1:30 pm and woke up at 2:20 pm feeling much less hot so I thought it had broken, but I was told by my friend who dropped by that I was still feverish just much lower.  Slept from about 2:45-3:55 pm; headache was much better when I awoke; tingles and sore arm remained.  Realized at 4:13 pm that I&#39;d had no appetite the whole day. I&#39;d also barely been able to force myself to drink water; too cold and it hurt, room temperature didn&#39;t feel right.  No times, but felt periodic stabbing pain in my left ear until about 6:30 pm.  Much else also recovered by 6:30 pm: felt well enough to drink cold stuff, tingles were low grade, fever was present but low. Arm was still sore.  7:08 pm headache was gone.  8:49 pm felt much better and able to do things and take care of myself with minimal discomfort, but felt a little lousy overall - low grade headache, head felt like there was some pressure in it, periodic tingles, achy arm.  9:29 pm felt exhausted and slightly achy but otherwise mostly normal. Felt some hunger twinges for the first time that day but nothing felt appealing (realized I had only eaten about 5 spoonfuls of soup the whole day). Fell asleep getting ready for bed; woke up at 10:49 pm and finished getting ready for bed then went back to sleep.  Summary: Friday: Symptoms: mild to moderate nausea, mild dizziness, mild to moderate injection site pain, pins and needles in glutes and thighs, joint pain  Treatment: drinking water  Saturday:  Symptoms: mild to moderate pain at injection site, headache, fever, nausea, tiredness, glute and thigh tingles, lack of appetite, periodic stabbing pain in left ear  Treatments: ice/cold pack on arm (helped with arm pain while on), drinking water, sleeping

Patient was awoken with a light shake on the shoulder, but not to noise.  The patient stated they had difficulty hearing, along with nausea and light headedness.  The patient denied any other symptoms, including difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, and body soreness.  Nothing was administered on the pharmacy&#39;s end.

                                                I noticed a very mild headache and slight coldness within 2 hours of my vaccine.  Onset of my severe symptoms began around 10PM on 03/12/2021 with a stabbing headache (Felt like someone took an air pump and kept &#39;blowing up&#39; my head. My eyes felt achy and heavy and every time I looked in a different direction I would get a zapping/electric feeling throughout my head that would cause my head and neck to spasm (longer duration) or twitch (quick jolt). This also caused dizziness). I got really cold and had intense shivering and shaking. Around midnight, my skin started feeling bruised all over my body (very sensitive to touch, including my bed sheets against my spine felt like rubbing up against a wound). At the same time, my joints (especially my neck, hips, and knees) got hot to the touch and were incredibly painful (induced tears). My muscles developed a deep ache that also caused significant pain. I felt very weak and confused. I didn&#39;t take my temperature until the early morning, and it was 102.9 at that time. I alternated taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen throughout the day, but my temperature stayed between 102 and 103.1 for about 24 hours, as did the previously noted symptoms.   I noticed a gradual improvement of my symptoms over the next two days. On the evening of 03/14/2021, my headache worsened some, and I had an unexpected episode where I nearly passed out (dropped to the floor but stayed conscious). I also had intermittent foot tingling (very noticeable, not mild) over the course of a few hours.   For 3 full days (but by far the most severe within the first 24 hours), I experienced some strange sound processing. Things like the sound of a car driving by or the ceiling fan felt like it echoed throughout my whole body and gave me an uncomfortable shivering feeling.   As of today (03/16/2021), I am mostly recovered. I am still experiencing fatigue, a very mild headache, and some mild pain. My nausea has completely resolved, though that was never a chief complaint of mine.   I realize that some of my symptoms are to be expected with this vaccine. But especially the level of pain I experienced throughout my entire body was very concerning and not something that I was aware could happen as a result of the vaccine.

                                                Was administered covid vaccine J&amp;J  on left arm felt a burning sensation just after it which i knew it normal you just got a vaccine. Walked to the observatory area where we are supposed to wait 15min until you are released to go. Well less than 10 min in the observation area that?s when i started to feel un well my body started sweating excessively and thats when i felt numbness on my right side of my head with a tingling sensation couldn?t hear with my right ear and i freaked out when i started to get blurred vision thats when i knew something was wrong i got up to ask for water once i got up i felt like i was going to faint and felt really dizzy. Once i got to the lady that was there in the observation area  she was shocked at how i looked she told me to go sit down and brought me water as she called the ambulance. Once i was sitting down and was brought water i drank like more than half of the water and the numbness was going down from my right side of my head but still had blurred vision and just felt disoriented and not my self. The ambulance took me to the ER once i got there i felt a little better but still disoriented and dizzy. So disoriented that i left the hospital with me actually realizing i had to stay there to get checked because they kept saying i was fine.

                                                I had sparkles in my vision 5 min. after getting my shot. They went away quickly, so I wasn&#39;t concerned. I had a little bit of hotness up my neck and a little itchy, but both also were quick to go away. I went home and went to bed without issue. I woke up at 4am crying and in a lot of pain all over my body. I had a crushing headache, my back, arms and legs ached down to the bone. I had a fever of 100.7, and had to call in sick from work. I took 3 ibuprofen and it didn&#39;t help stop the pain or fever. I cried myself back to sleep after wreathing in pain for 3 hours. Woke up again crying again and the pain and fever continued on. I drank 2 beers to see if that would help relax my muscles and back around 3pm and by 4pm I finally felt somewhat better, but still couldn&#39;t get up out of bed. I had to call my brother over to help me and considered asking him to take me to the hospital several times because the pain was so intense. The spot where I got my shot wasn&#39;t inflamed, or if it was I didn&#39;t notice. It did seem a little stiff. I managed to fall back asleep and by the time I woke up again the next day around 5am, I felt completely fine. Fever disappeared and the body pain was gone. It was like nothing had ever happened.

                                                On 03/18/2021 at 03:30AM I had a lot of arm pain from my shoulder to my elbow in my left arm. This lasted until 03/31/2021.  On 03/18/2021 I woke up with a headache that would not go away. Next, at about 03:15PM I was not able to walk for about 10 minutes. Then, at about 05:00PM I started menstruating. At 07:00PM I had severe pain in my pelvic area for an hour and a half. At approximately 08:30PM I passed a softball sized blood clot vaginally.  I bled heavily through the night.  On 03/19/2021 I still had a headache and no energy at all. I continued to bleed heavily all day as well. 03/20/2021 was the exact same as the days prior. 03/21/2021 I was still bleeding heavily throughout the day with no energy. I still had the headache as well. I started feeling dizzy while walking on this day.  03/22/2021 I went to work like normal. I was cold all day. I was still bleeding, headache and dizziness. It was hard to stand for 30 minutes. While climbing the stairs I got very light headed and dizzy. I could not go up the stairs at a normal pace. 03/23/2021 I had the same symptoms all day but I was getting short of breath walking short distances. I still had very little energy and a headache. I also lost all color in my face and hands. I was still cold all day. I noticed some slight swelling in my ankles.  03/24/2021 The symptoms were getting more intense. I was still cold.  I finally took some aspirin for the headache because it was very severe. The medication didn&#39;t help with it. This routine went on for the next week and the symptoms intensified with each day. Throughout this time I was still passing clots that ranged in size from golf/ping pong ball to baseballs. They were very painful when they passed.  The days from 03/25/2021 to 04/01/2021 were all the same as far as how I felt.  On 04/02/2021 I woke up with the same symptoms but now I could not stay awake for anything. I slept on and off all day. I only ate one meal a day because I was so tired and I had no appetite. The headache was getting worse as the days went on. The bleeding was still happening. It was not as heavy as the weeks before, but enough to be painful still. I also started having abdominal pain.  On 04/03/2021 I was seeing stars when I moved too quickly. My heart rate was elevated with shortness of breath along with the rest of the previous symptoms. My headache however was very intense.  04/04/2021 I still couldn&#39;t stay awake on top of all the other symptoms. The dizziness and stars were more frequent. I couldn&#39;t move my head without seeing stars.  04/05/2021 I couldn&#39;t get warm and I still felt the same way. I called and made a doctor?s appointment for Wednesday the 7th. I had all the same symptoms still and they were getting worse. I had to move in slow motion so I could try to function.  04/06/2021 I woke up drained of all my energy and color. I couldn&#39;t shower because of the pain in my body. I couldn&#39;t stand because I felt like I was going to fall down. I could barely stand up straight let alone walk very far. I was shaking from being so cold. I had all the same symptoms from the days prior. I was in severe pain. I couldn&#39;t sit because of the pain in my abdomen I couldn&#39;t stand because of the weakness in my legs. I could barely see anything because of the stars I was seeing. At this point I had no color and I was barely conscious. That is when my family took me to the emergency room.

I then started to sweat profusely from every inch of my skin. I couldn?t catch my breath. I was handed water and told to sip on it, which proved difficult when my throat started to feel like it was swelling up. After about a 15 minute ordeal, it was like nothing ever happened. The only symptom that remained, was sweat soaked clothes

                                                Patient administered Janssen vaccine on 5/5/21 at 1011AM by pharmacist on duty. Patient did not admit any anxiety surrounding vaccine during counseling prior to receiving the vaccine. After administration patient mentioned she has can get anxious sometimes and has tendency to create symptoms in her head. She asked what to be on the look out for for signs of syncope and described starting to feel nauseous, clamy, and tunnel vision. Within seconds she briefly lost consciousness and started to slump in chair within immunization room. Pharmacist prevented her from falling out of chair while opening door to waiting room and asked for assistance from patients boyfriend. Together we held patient in place on chair and propped feet up on another chair. Immediately patient regained consciousness enough to explain what she was feeling but then quickly lost consciousness again and started snoring as if she immediately fell asleep. Boyfriend said no history of sleep issues/narcolepsy, together we laid patient on floor of immunization room with feet slightly elevated and boyfriend at her head and again she immediately regained consciousness. Patient explained that she was immediately starting to feel better and felt dizzy and described having very odd dream like scenarios. She laid on floor for 10 min, Alert and orientedx4, moved to seated position for another 10 min, accepted offer for apple juice, moved to waiting area to sit for another 10min before OK leaving. MOD/PDM aware....Called patient at 6pm that same evening and patient reported feeling great.

                                                On Thursday morning I noticed a pain where my ear meets my jaw and as the day went on it became more severe, to the point I couldn&#39;t open my mouth to eat. The next day my ear was in pain, felt full, started to get swollen, couldn&#39;t hear very well out of it. The following day I lost all hearing out of it, it became even more swollen, has been throbbing, can&#39;t even see inside my ear. I went to a Clinic on Saturday, the 15th, and they diagnosed me with an ear infection. After 3 doses of an antibiotic, 3 doses of prescribed ear drops, and several days worth of ibuprofen the swelling has only gotten worse with terrible pain.

The dryness is only very bad in the mornings and then slowly goes away throughout the day, but I am still sniffly/nasally throughout the day.

                                                About 7-8 minutes later I started feeling pressure in the  right side of my head. It went away a bit. I was walking after the 15 minutes and started feeling weird in my face, I just sat in my car and waited because I had to drive.  I started feeling numbness under my eye and down the rest of my face. The thing that worried me the most I had so much pressure under my eye like it was inside my brain.  The numbness and pain caused me to freak out.  I went to back to the convention center to let them know, they brought the Paramedic to me they started checking me and doing a work up. They told me I wasn&#39;t a life threatening emergency and my vitals were ok. They offered to take me to the ER and I declined and I decided to leave because I have been there for 1hr 45mins. I felt like my symptoms were at 70%. When I got home I freaked out again because the numbness didn&#39;t go away and my face looked like it was a little lower and had a panic attack and went to the ER. They checked on me and told me I didn&#39;t have a stroke. They told me It was a side effect to the vaccine. They told me to follow up with the Neurologist if I have any more symptoms, I have an appointment with them in a couple weeks. I&#39;m a little concerned because there is a minor pain that I didn&#39;t have before on my right side and it worries me.

                                                I awoke at 6:45 a.m. feeling a bit sore in my arm, but relatively okay.  I was up for approximately ten minutes and then extended my arms over my head to stretch out some of the achiness and immediately regretted the action.  I began to feel dizzy and nauseous and saw black spots encroaching on my peripheral vision.  I washed my face to relieve some discomfort with no change.  I walked toward the bedroom to grab my glass of water when the black spots increased, clouded my entire vision, and I collapsed on the bed.  I then began to hyper-salivate and after waking my husband and catching my breath, I returned to bathroom, experienced diarrhea, and simultaneously vomited into the trash can.  The vomit tasted chemical and extremely acidic.  My body was also shaking uncontrollably during this time and I kept switching between chills and being too hot.  After I felt comfortable leaving the bathroom, I crawled back in bed but was shaking so much that I couldn&#39;t stop my teeth from chattering and could not get warm no matter that my husband placed an extra blanket over me.  I had taken my temperature before while I was in the bathroom and it read 94.6 degrees Fahrenheit.  I took it again in bed about twenty minutes later and it read 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.  My head was splitting and my arm ached, but I was eventually able to go back to sleep.  I felt better after sleeping for a few hours and drinking more fluids.

                                                Around 4 pm I was starting to feel a little sore. By 4:30 pm I had some major chills that turned into hot flashes. At around 4:30 pm I took 400mg of Ibuprofen. For 1 hour I was fighting a fever and chill spells that rapidly changed during that 1 hour time period, ending at 5:30 pm. Within that time I had major acks in my back and neck. I also experience sinus pressure and pins and needs in my ears and behind my ears. After 5:30 pm I did feel significantly better and now are 8:00 pm I feel exhausted, my head hurts and my ears feel like they weigh a pound each. Hope that was helpful. Thanks for doing what you&#39;re doing.

                                                After receiving the shot, I was required to sit down for 15 minutes. About 5 minutes in, I started to become dizzy, my vision started blacking out, my hearing was muffled, I became clammy, sweaty, and experienced mental disorientation. It became harder for me to breathe, but I never struggled to take a breath. I drank some water and waited for the symptoms to subside. I remained seated and these symptoms went away within 5 minutes. After feeling better for about 5 minutes, I felt cold and was shivering. The woman sitting next to me was completely fine after her shot. I&#39;ve since felt a slight burning sensation on my skin in areas that I have scratched lightly. I&#39;m also experiencing strange feelings throughout my body- specifically my head, leg, and hand. It feels like I can feel something in each area for a bit and then it subsides after several minutes.

I sweated through all of the clothes and soaked the chair I was sitting in.  That night around 7 pm I got a migraine and felt really fatigued I couldn&#39;t stay awake and I was really sore. My chest hurt and so did my head. I was nauseated to no end The next day was worse. All day I couldn&#39;t stay awake. I felt so sore and sick to my stomach and I coint move too much because I was super dizzy. The next day I was still sick and dizzy  By day four I felt fine just dizzy.

After 5 minutes of waiting the patient slumped over and passed out onto the floor.  Her color was very pale and her eyes were rolling in the back of her head.  She regained consciousness but her color was still poor and we called and ambulance because she was still feeling faint.  The  EMT&#39;s immediately took her blood pressure and it was extremely low.  She acknowledged that she did not eat or drink anything at all that morning.  The EMT&#39;s recommended she go to the hospital but she refused.  After 30 minutes with emergency personnel she felt better and well enough to leave with her family member who was with her.

                                                The day I received the shot, I started to feel severe fatigue, headache, light-headed, and started running a fever about 6 hours after the shot was administered.  The next day (4/6) was worse. Severe fatigue, muscle aches, headache, loss of appetite, fever (101.5 was the highest I notice but seemed to be around 101.1-101.3 all day), and general flu like symptoms. However, I also started experiencing abnormal menstrual bleeding. I am on the Depo shot and have been for some time. Due to this, I do not usually experience any menstrual bleeding so I found this to be a little odd. It was not heavy but it was noticeable and contained quite a few clots.   Day 3 (4/7) was about the same except my fever came down and ranged from 99.8-101.1. Abnormal menstrual bleeding continued. New side effect this day included diarrhea.   Day 4 (4/8) I started to see improvement. No fever (that I could tell). Remaining side effects included mild headache, fatigue, diarrhea, and abnormal menstrual bleeding.   Day 5 (4/9), I had one of the worst nose bleeds I&#39;ve ever had in my life. I apologize for the graphic description but it lasted about 20 minutes and my bathroom looked like a crime scene after. Blood was pouring out of my left nostril and I threw two large clots that were about the size of slug (or slightly larger than a fun size snickers... I wish I had a better way to describe it). I&#39;ve had some bad nose bleeds, particularly when I was on Accutane, and this was worse! The rest of the day I felt like I was improving. Energy levels were better. No fever. Menstrual bleeding stopped. Only lingering side effect was mild headache and mild diarrhea.   Since then I&#39;ve continued to feel better and the diarrhea seems like it&#39;s improving.  Mild headache persists. Only new  item is an annoying twitch in my left eye that started on Monday (4/12).

                                                I was fine for the most part after the vaccine. The only thing that hurt was my arm at the injection site. I started feeling nauseous about an hour later. Then at about 9:00 pm, I started to feel really sick. I felt very tired and my whole body hurt. I had a low body temperature, 95 degrees. Chills, fever, shaking, nausea. Very SEVERE symptoms. Felt very disoriented. I thought I was going to pass out and faint. Vision blurry and seen white.  Pounding headache. Ears ringing. I could hardly walk that night, I was crawling on the floor. I felt out of breath. My heart was beating very fast. My left side of my chest hurt by my ribs. When I did wake up from sleep, I woke up with blood in my mouth and dried blood on my lips.

Bad taste in mouth and bad smell in nose since recieving the vaccine and currently still experiencing (causing foods to taste or smell spoiled, sour or rotten , unable to enjoy things that I previously liked)- the taste and smell are like that of dirty, old, wet paper towels and are present all the time even when I&#39;m not eating.

Headache symptoms included head pressure, ear pain, and generalized full body weakness. Went to urgent care at 6:00pm.  Due to ongoing health issues it was hard for the doctor to tell if it was a reaction to the vaccine or not at the time of exam. The doctor discharged me and recommend I go to ER if symptoms progress/get worse.

All food tasted and smelled metallic for two weeks.  Three weeks after the shot the problem resolved for cold food. It is five weeks I still have a problem with eating hot food that it tastes and smells metallic. I consulted a doctor and he told me that he doesn?t know what to do.

Patient woke up overnight with severe headache that was different than her typical migraines headaches. Headache was &#34;like I never had before&#34;, &#34;it&#39;s really painful.&#34; When I asked if this was the worst headache of her life she responded &#34;probably.&#34;  No photophonia, no phonophobia, no nausea, and no vomiting, which she gets every time she has migraines. &#34;This is a different type of headache,&#34; she said.  &#34;I usually throw up and my headaches get better.&#34; This headache feels like a &#34;balloon in my head.&#34; She reported vision changes (blurred vision) 45 minutes prior to our visit which started at 8:19 a.m. on April 21, 2021. (&#34;I was having a problem with peripheral vision, about 45 minutes ago,&#34; but not so much now. Patient denies loss of balance (dizziness), seizures, focal weakness, radicular symptoms, saddle anesthesia, sensory changes, slurred speech, numbness, chills, and fever. She was sent to the emergency department for further evaluation. She is a female patient with new, severe headache that is between 18 and 48 years of age, and has received the Ad26.COV2.S (COVID-19) vaccine within 3 weeks of headache onset.

It?s gotten much better, but I still have a very small lump there. I was seen on April 19th for constant pounding in my left ear that started around April 12th. I was told I had pulsatile tinnitus, and I will be having a MRA scan on May 8th. I have felt some pressure in my head since then, and was told it may be related, but to just wait for the scan.

I laid down to go to sleep at 8:30 PM and dosed in and out of sleep. Around 10:30 PM I had a fever of 100.7 degree Fahrenheit. Around 12 AM my fever broke and by 1:30 PM I started feeling better. I had a really bad headache all night and into the morning, so bad I could feel throbbing in my teeth. I still have some soreness in my left hip joint and shoulder/neck. I have also had diarrhea once around 12:30 PM today. I did have COVID-19 at the end of December 2020 into January 2020. Not sure if that makes a difference.

The lip tingling was within 30 minutes of my vaccine, and continued for 2 weeks.  Throat swelling lasted the first week.  Hives lasted 1 week 4 days. Coughing started on day 3 and lasted 3 days. Asthma attack happened one time, during the coughing phase.  High blood pressure started the evening of the vaccine and has continued. Doctor has prescribed a low dose of blood pressure medication to help combat it. Fever and chills started on the first day and lasted through the second day.

                                                At the time of injection, it was pretty painful and thus sent my body into a shock less than 5 mins after receiving my dose. My vision went white and I was very light-headed and hot/sweaty.  A nurse came with me outside to monitor and I was feeling back to normal in 15 minutes. This is something that happens when I experience a high amount of pain, so just reporting for others who maybe have low blood pressure issues.  At about 8pm, other side effects started to set in. I first experienced a headache, then experienced soreness/ache-y-ness  in my back. Around 8:30, I started to feel light headed again and soon my whole body felt ache-y. I quickly developed chills where I felt so cold that I was uncontrollably shaking and felt very sore/stiff. I have been laying under a heated blanket for the last hour and a half and am finally feeling better with no more shaking  or chills. I still have soreness throughout my body and a headache, but I took ibuprofen around 8:30pm.

                                                Around 3:15 in the afternoon, I began experiencing severe aches and muscle pains, combined with a growing migraine. Not realizing what it may be related to, I took two ibuprofen and I&#39;ve acetaminophen.  By the time I around home around 6:30, I could barely hold myself up. I ate dinner, which only helped minimally, and by 8 pm felt like death. My husband notice I looked red and felt my forehead, immediately going for the thermometer. I had a fever of 100.5.  We eventually got me into bed after downing a lot of water, but the pain would not ease up. The pain was too excruciating. At 10:30 my husband came to bed and we took my temp again which was 101.6. To help me sleep I took another Tylenol. At 5:45 my work alarm went off and I checked my temp again; still 101.6. I got a cold pack for my migraine and went back to sleep. Slowly throughout the day my fever dwindled, until it finally broke in the early afternoon. By 4:15, as I am writing this, all that&#39;s left is done tiredness, thirst, and a small bit of achiness.

The day after I recieved the covid vaccine Janssen, I started noticing the injection site getting red and swollen. By the next day it had grown in size and was itching rather badly. I could sleep from how badly it was itching and burning. It has been 6 days since I got the vaccine and it&#39;s still large and swollen and really itchy. I have been taking ibuprofen for the pain and using benadryl for the itching.

I then had severe flu like symptoms overnight, including chills, and feeling hot and cold at the same time.  I woke up with a headache. I had muscle pains through the entire ordeal.  At 7am the next day, I took 600mg of ibuprofen and took a walk. I then felt fine.

                                                Headache (turned into a migraine), extremely drained of energy, lack of appetite, and felt off all day (4/9/21). The next morning (4/10/21) felt the same as the day before, however, had several episodes where I would get really light headed, dizzy, and nauseous. Went to Home Depot at 2:15pm (4/10) and while there my vision blurred and started to fade, I had ringing in my ears and couldn?t hear out of the right and barely was able to hear out of the left. I got very nauseous and I couldn?t breath. I managed to sit on something and put my head between my legs that helped. Fortunately my step- dad was with me and helped me outside while I could barely see and hear and he stated I was very pale. I was having a hard time talking or being conherent. Once outside the symptoms slowly cleared over about the next 6-7 hours. At 4:45pm my mom decided to take me to the doctor but the walk in had just closed and I went to the ER. They stated I had elevated d-dime and did a chest CT scan  to check for blood clots around 7:30pm (I believe not sure exact time) doctor stated they came back clear but when asked if he suspected that the episode and symptoms were due to a dissipated blood clot he would not directly answer it. I overheard him dictating his notes and he started he beloved as such. I have never experienced anything like this before. I still felt drained, headache (migraine), occasionally dizzy, and lack of appetite (4/11/21, 4/12/21) and still currently feel the same drained, migraine, lack of appetite, and occasionally dizzy.

                                                It started slowly with feeling extra tired and light arm soreness. Then rapidly became extreme shivering, a fever, headache and full body muscle aches. In the early morning I also got stomachache cramps and felt hungry, but food didn?t help. It actually made me feel nauseous. By 6am the next day I had a serious migraine too - sensitivity to light. My eyes hurt. It actually was so bad I caved and took 2 liquid Advil?s to help with the pain. From there I slowly got better over the day but still had the above mentioned symptoms, just less intense. Around 8pm the fever came back and I called it a night.  Next morning I felt better, but still tired. Still had a headache but not a migraine. And occasional stomach aches. It?s now 2 days later and the head aches, arm soreness and occasional stomach aches have not gone away.

                                                Got my vaccine on Monday in my right arm. On Thursday morning I had blurry spots in my eyes that lasted a couple of hours. It almost felt like i had something in my eyes. I kept rubbing and checking them. I called my primary care doctor and the office told me he would call me back. An hour later the blurs went away but the right side of my face down my neck had a numbing sensation. My right ear also felt like it need to be ?popped? like when on a plane that wouldn?t go away. Wasn?t completely numb but felt numb. When my doctor called me back i told him my symptoms and he told me to go to the emergency room. They ran blood work and did a CT and saw nothing abnormal beside my iron was a little low but I?m pregnant so that wasn?t surprising. I left not really knowing why I?m feeling this in my face. It still has that numbing feeling. And Friday i had a 10 minute nose bleed on my right side where I?m feeling the numbness.

                                                My first side effects were fatigue and feeling ?out of it?, which started about 2 hours after the injection. At 7 hours after my left leg became numb and a little sore. I started to notice a feverish, tingly feeling on my skin and this would last at least 24 hours. These symptoms quickly spread through my whole lower body. The chills and intense body aches started at 11 pm. I woke up at 2 am that night and had a low grade fever 99.9 F. I took 2 pills of Tylenol. The fever broke around 3:30 or 4 am and I slept through the rest of the night. The next morning 3/09, I felt fatigue, slow, and woozy. I still had chills and muscle aches, although the intensity was less. Halfway through the day the chills intensified, the muscle aches became more severe, and my eyeballs felt like they were burning in the back of my head. By that evening, the fever was back and I couldn?t think straight. My legs ached with a pain that I?ve never felt before. I did not have a severe headache, but I felt that if I exerted myself too much I would get one. My partner said I could barely form coherent sentences, and I was so weak I couldn?t sit up straight. I took 2 more Tylenol that night, went to bed and slept through the whole night. The morning of 3/10 I woke up feeling tired but my skin did not have that feverish feeling. I was no longer sick. On 3/11 I woke up and did my normal morning routine. I ate an egg, some of a Nutella stuffed scone, and drank coffee and water. I took my 3 pills, loratadine, omeprazole, and a probiotic, and I had a severe allergic reaction within 5 minutes of taking the pills. For the next 10 minutes my breathing became labored and wheezy. I experienced severe eosinophilic esophagitis symptoms. For the next week, my EoE symptoms were heightened. I had a reaction after drinking a seltzer water, which does not usually affect me. Within 2 weeks I was back to normal and to my knowledge have not experienced any other related side effects.

I took her BP AT 610PM, it was normal at 128/78 and immunization tech held an ice back on the back of her neck.  She recovered quickly and we waited with her for the remainder of her 15 minute wait.  Two people were with her.  We got a motorized cart for her.  She left after the 15 minutes and felt fine, stating no residual issues.

Within 5 minutes after receiving injection I got up and walked less than 10 feet when I began experiencing extreme dizziness, ringing in the ears, lightheadedness, felt warm, and began to feel chills/tingling throughout my whole body but especially in my head.  I ended up passing out and was unable to sit up in a chair without assistance. For about 10 minutes I was profusely sweating all over my entire body, had continued chills/tingling, difficulty breathing and was semi coherent. The nurse at the pharmacy had me sniff ammonia salt and gave me water to help. I waited for 20 more minutes before finally feeling able to get up and walk around the store. Body chills and cold sweats continued for a while but no further symptoms at this time (2hrs after vaccination).

                                                About 7 hours or so after I was vaccinated I began to feel a pulsing type of headache, but i was tired so I fell asleep. About 3 hours later (around 6am) I woke up with the worst headache I&#39;ve ever felt. On a  pain scale of 0 to 10 it was a solid 10. It was a splitting headache, a pulsing and crippling pain, it was also sensitive to light. Every time I moved or changed the direction in which I was looking the pain would surge through my head and paralyzed me. I took 1000 MG of acetaminophen and then half an hour later I took 800 MG of ibuprofen. The headache calmed down a for a while, but 8 hours later I was already feeling just as bad as when I felt the headache the worst, so I took another dose of acetaminophen and ibuprofen. The entire day went on like that, along with body aches, some nausea and fatigue. Throughout the next four days,  all of those symptoms gradually diminished. On the third day after vaccination, the injection site felt very sore; my whole arm would hurt every time I moved it.

                                                At about 9:30 I was looking at my phone. My vision started going blurry. I started seeing flashing lights and could not be around any light. I went to a dark room and about 30 minutes later it stopped where a wasn&#39;t seeing a flashing line.  I took melatonin and went to bed figuring I was starting to get tired.  I woke up at 638am. Arm super sore, a red spot over the size of a quarter at injection site. Low grade 99.1 and my entire body hurts and a small headache. Called in to work to rest for the day.

Friend who had vaccine same day same exact symptoms also tested positive, were never near each other and no one else around me is sick.

Concerned my bone was hit with a too long vaccine needle. Had chills/fever evening of 4/4/2021 into morning of 4/6/2021?had to take off work. Have had neurological symptoms ongoing with ?brain fogginess? since 4/5/2021. On 4/6/2021, began to see flashes/spots of light in vision of left eye, which worsened through today. Took off afternoon from work and went to an eye clinic to have eye dilated and looked at, but the spots in vision continue through reporting time (4/7/2021, 5pm CT).

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I began to feel nauseous, almost like being car sick while looking at my phone. I also began to feel tightness in my chest. After my 15 minutes were up I asked the administrator of my shot if it was normal that I felt dizzy/chest tightness. They said it was probably fine and just to monitor my  symptoms. I went and sat in my car a few min and I began to feel very strange, it seemed very bright out, I felt weak, and my eyes felt very heavy. I wanted to get home so I started driving but on the highway, my heart beat was very fast and I began to feel like I couldn&#39;t swallow. At one point felt as though I might be about to choke so I pulled over because I thought I was going to have to dial 911 as my throat was feeling like it was closing up. I tried swallowing a few times with great effort and after a few minutes the sensation started to lessen. My throat hadn&#39;t closed up completely, however it did feel like it had swelled up.

                                                12 hours after injection I was shivering freezing using multiple blankets. When I tried to walk I was very dizzy with blurred vision. I had body aches and a severe headache. My temperature was 104.7 with the thermometer. My breathing was as if I worked out but was just sleeping. I called an ambulance and was taken to health center where doctor took over care.

I turned around because I didn?t think I would make it to bathroom and told site worker I felt dizzy. He tried walking me back to car but my sight for super blurry and I passed out. I came back into it pretty quickly after passing out. I was super sweaty after shot.

Immediately after being vaccinated, pt. requested to remain seated.  The nurse noted that the pt. was getting pale so she suggested the pt. take off the surgical mask to get some air.  Before pt. had a chance to take off the mask she lost consciousness.  Together with another nurse patient was lowered onto the floor.  Pt. regained consciousness for 30-45 seconds and then began to have seizure like activity.  Her eyes rolled back and her body became stiff and began a jerking motion.  911 was called. This seizure like activity lasted 4-6 seconds at which time pt. regained consciousness and immediately sat up.  Pt was pale and diaphoretic.  BP 98/64, HR 78, Pulse Ox 99%.  Pt vomited multiple times.  Ice was applied to the posterior neck and a cold compress to the forehead .  EMS arrived and took vitals: BP 78/40.  Pt. was aware of person, place and situation.  Pt. was taken to Hospital accompanied by her husband.  Pt was called by me Friday and she was home.  All tests showed no sign of having a seizure.

                                                I am currently pregnant. This is my first pregnancy.  My due date is August 29, 2021.  My pregnancy has thus far been really easy with no complications.  I had a low grade fever that I took Tylenol to treat.  I had pretty bad muscle and joint pain, chills, and could not stop shaking.  I just felt freezing.  Once my fever broke I felt extremely hot all night.  The next morning I was exhausted and had a lot of the muscle and joint pain still.  I marked on my report that it would&#39;ve stopped me from going about my normal daily activities, as I could not have gone to work and spent most of the day resting.  For the next few days I was tired and my eyes ached.  On Monday and Tuesday I had a headache in the afternoon.  Yesterday afternoon my eyes finally stopped aching and everything seems to be back to normal.

Then later around 10:00am a feeling of tiredness came over my whole body.  Around 12:00pm I felt even more tired, lightheaded  and my eyeballs felt as if with high pressure in them and are feel sensitive to the sunlight.  Also, at 12pm, I had lunch, which was my first meal of this day and felt the necessity to lay in bed and take a nap for 20 minutes before returning to work.  While taking the nap I felt tingling on my feet, arms, hands and neck along with certain sudden muscle contractions on the same parts.

                                                After being administered the vaccine at 7:12 am, when the nurse stood me up and started to walk me to the holding area, I became dizzy, my legs got weak, and there was a loud ringing in my ears. I nearly collapsed as I reached the seat in the holding area they were taking me to. I placed one 0.5MG tablet of my prescription Alprazolam in my mouth and waited for the nurse to bring water. They took me via wheelchair from the holding area to a secluded spot behind a curtain. There, I laid on a cot, received cold water, and a nurse talked to me while I recovered. It felt like I was having an anxiety attack, which has never happened to me after getting a shot before. Fitbit heart rate data shows my heart rate at 105 BPM at 7:00 am (going through the admission process, walking around the facility), 83 BPM at 7:10 am, 79 BPM at 7:15 am, 74 BPM at 7:20 am. Between 8:15 am and 1:25 pm, my heart rate remained between 63 and 89 BPM. My arm was sore and my skin hurt (an issue that I have when I feel very stressed). Additional symptoms arose around 1:35 pm. I began going through cycles of chills, sweating and overheating. My heart rate ranged from 127 BPM and 93 BPM for the remainder of the night. I took Tylenol at 7:07 PM to help with my fever.

                                                Within 2 hours I was dizzy, nausea an light headed. Within 4 hours I had a fever (uncontrollable), I laid down. I wasn&#39;t able to get up and my arm swelled up really bad.  I was having streak in my vison and really bad dey eyes and mouth.  I had a fever on going for about 3 weeks straight. I called my Doctor the following day and she said it was a normal reaction, if it get&#39;s worse to call her again. I called her again because it got worse, my neck got swollen. left arm was trembling, lymph nodes were swollen, leg leg was pulsating. I started having chills and hot flashes ( I still have some till this day). My Doctor recommended seeing a specialist- Neurologist, Infectious Disease Dr.  The Neurologist said he can see where I get the trembles but does not  want to put me on medication and see if it goes away on it&#39;s own. I have a follow up with him regarding trembles, headache, flashing in my eyes. The Infectious Disease Dr. I&#39;m following up her her again regarding my arm swelling, they prescribed me steroids but had not gone down.  Since all of this I have been very fatigue, this is everyday.

                                                Within about 30 mins of the shot I became extremely lethargic. Hard to keep my eyes open. The injection site was extremely hot to touch and very sore. While the rest of my body was of normal temperature. Shortly after, I?d say about 45 minutes after injection, came the cold chills. I was freezing cold and shaking  fallowed by a fever. I became very foggy. It was hard to keep a conversation and had extreme waves of nausea. My mouth would salivate like the vomit was coming. I never actually vomited. But that continued  for the next 36 hours. I had to call out of work yesterday. Starting 24hrs after injection. I could not get out of bed. My body was very weak. Aches everywhere, I was freezing cold shaking with chills yet waking up in my bed covered in sweat. I was extremely restless and kept waking up to put a cold towel on my head to try to break my fever. At this point my headache was so severe. Any movement felt like my head would explode.  It?s now 48 hours after the injection my head is still pounding and my body still full of aches. Left arm is still really sore. I truly regret taking the vaccine. And would recommend others to not take it until further testing goes into this product.

                                                The following day after my vaccination, I had a severe headache all over the top of my head and eventually only the left side of my head and face felt intense pain. It felt kind of like a stabbing or shooting pain down into my head. Then I started feeling a lot if pressure and pain in my left eye, eye brow, and the sinus area. I could hardly open my eyes. My left side of my face also tingled with tiny sharp pains or numbness. This pain intensified for about 5 days so I started taking aspirin. It would feel slightly better but then would feel even worse.  I decided to use a netti pot to remove pressure. After about 5 days of using that I started to feel better. I would say I started to feel back to normal two weeks after the shot.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the vaccine, while I was in the 15 minute observation period, I began to feel hot and cold at the same time, began sweating heavily, my limbs started becoming very weak and I started seeing spots. I called over a doctor and explained what was happening. He got a wheelchair and brought me to a room to lie down. During this time, my vision continued to get worse (seeing more spots and less peripheral vision).  Upon laying down, the doctor put my feet up and a nurse took my blood pressure. If I remember correctly, it was 90/58. My normal blood pressure is around 112/68. A nurse also put ice under my neck. Immediately upon laying down, I started feeling better. I was observed for a while more and then a nurse took my blood pressure again (both laying down and sitting up). My limbs still felt weak when seated and my blood pressure was better but not normal yet, so I was told to lay down a bit longer. Then, a nurse checked my blood pressure again (laying down, sitting up and standing up). It was back to normal and I was feeling better. I was cleared to leave the vaccine clinic. Since leaving the clinic, I haven&#39;t had any abnormal side effects or reactions.

I also had numb fingertips which lasted for around 20 minutes right after the chills really set in. I&#39;m not positive its related but two nights after my vaccine injection, I woke up at night because my feet were itching and hot. They also had the pins and needles sensation and these symptoms lasted around 20 to 30 minutes. I have never had that happen before so I assume it was vaccine related.

                                                About 5 hours after receiving the vaccine, I was overcome with uncontrollable muscle spasms / body shakes. After about 5 minutes they subsided, but the same thing happened a few hours later and were so overwhelming I had to crawl on the floor to move. I felt achey and exhausted, with heavy night sweating. The next day, symptoms included  light sensitivity, headache, chills, sweats, body aches, fatigue and a 101 degree fever. My symptoms subsided by the next day, about 36 hours after the initial injection.

                                                The patient received the Janssen Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine from a certified immunizing technician. She was asked to wait 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine before leaving the pharmacy and remained seated in the post vaccination waiting area chair. She began feeling dizzy and lightheaded. She was caught by her family members and the pharmacist on duty before she fell. She briefly had a mild seizure and lost consciousness for a minute. When she regained consciousness she stated that she felt nauseous and was seeing double. 911 was called. EMTs arrived and checked her alertness and how she was feeling. The EMTs then took her off in a stretcher to the hospital out of an abundance of caution due to brief loss of consciousness.

                                                I was tired when I got home after the shot, so I took a nap. When I woke up my teeth were chattering from a fever of 100, I was throwing up and had spasms, back pain, body pain, and I was shaking. It lasted all night, at least 5-6 hours. The next day was similar. I called my doctor a week later because I was hoping the symptoms would go away. My tongue was swollen which made it hard to talk. The doctor advised me to take Tylenol. I feel like I have had the flu everyday since April 10.

I tried using drops thinking that it was ear wax. The plugged feeling continued for the rest of the day and morphed into ringing. The ringing in my ear has intensified through the week. It is worse when I am alone or when it is quiet. I also have a mild headache and have been experiencing food sensitivity. This is all new, I have never experienced anything like this before. I am generally healthy, and never have any physical issues.

                                                May 30 at 37&#43;6 weeks pregnant with no pregnancy complications at this time: I experienced temporary vision loss in the field of view of my left eye. My vision in my left eye was obscured by a flashing, arching, lightning that I was afraid might be a sign of retinal or vitreal detachment. I returned to my house (was in a walk) within 5 minutes of the lightning appearing in my vision. I drank water and removed my contacts. The lightning disappeared gradually after about 15 minutes. I went to the ER/Labor&amp;Delivery anyway to confirm I wasn?t having pre-eclampsia (which can cause retinal detachment). My blood pressure was fine, baby?s heart rate was fine, my eyes were checked by my OB and I was evaluated for signs of a potential stroke. There were no observable issues. I was discharged and advised to see an opthamologist. There have been no issues with my eyesight since this event, but I have so chosen to wear my glasses rather than my contacts. I do not think this event is related to the vaccine. I think it is more likely an event related to pregnancy and dehydration.

                                                I?ve never had an allergic reaction to anything before.  Received the vaccine at around 9:55am on 03/08/21.  Pain while the vaccine was being administered but it healed within a few minutes. I started getting a mild headache at around 3:30pm while at work. When I got home at around 6pm I started having severe chills, the headache became intense, my mouth and eyelids felt hot, my hands and feet felt very cold and when I checked temperature it was 102.4.  By 9:00 pm the headache became excruciating like I?ve never had it before, as if my head was being squeezed or pressed. Eyes and the back of my jaw hurt too.  Had light and sound sensitivity. Took 200mg of Advil but pain was still almost intolerable until I was finally able to fall asleep at around 4:00 am.  Was still in pain the day after but not as bad as the night before. Only mild pain today but started feeling itchy tonight and noticed some rashes on my body.

I started to develop a low grade fever 8 hours after the shot. 13 hours after the shot, I had a 104.1 fever. Along with the fever, I experienced severe body aches and chills, nausea and a horrible headache. I couldn?t walk as my body was so weak and my vision was blurry. About 15 hours after the vaccine, my fever went down to 102. I was able to get up and walk to my kitchen to take some Advil. My fever broke 20 hours after the vaccine with the medicine. I?m still experiencing severe body aches, headache, nausea and chills and it has been about 30 hours after vaccine. I did have covid 3 months ago, and the symptoms from the vaccine were much worse than the symptoms I had with actual covid.

                                                3/6/21  This is a 32-year-old female who is receiving her first Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine and shortly afterwards developed some throat itching and tightness.  She was given a milligram of epinephrine by intramuscular injection by retired emergency physician there and then transported by ambulance here for further evaluation.  Says her tongue felt a little swollen as well but she denies any respiratory symptoms.  Her voice sounds crackly to her.  She denies any pruritus or rashes.  She has had multiple allergic reactions to medications in the past but never having to be admitted overnight.  One episode however did occur while she was hospitalized and receiving treatment.  She has never had to be intubated.  She has had isolated urticaria without oral or throat symptoms and vice versa.  At this point she says she does feel somewhat better. She is given IV dexamethasone and observed here.  At 1 point she complained of it complaint complained of it feeling like a tightening in the back of her throat was worsening.  She is given an additional intramuscular dose of epinephrine with epinephrine and on reexamination had no significant change in physical findings or her phonation.  This occurred again and she was given viscous lidocaine with minimal improvement in her symptoms.  After several hours of observation without objective worsening but continued complaint of feeling increasing tightness in her throat, CT imaging of the neck is performed to assess the soft tissue structures.  No abnormalities or indication of significant retropharyngeal or paralaryngeal edema or airway compromise present. Given the possibility of some laryngeal muscle or parapharyngeal muscle spasm as him, she was given Flexeril.  After some discussion with her I did indicate to her that I felt it would be safe to return home but offered admission for observation as well.  She indicated she was comfortable returning home for continued observation.  She will be continued on steroids and antihistamines and is given additional Flexeril by prescription if this does seem to help her symptoms.  If no improvement over the next 2 to 3 days and follow-up either with her primary providers through facility or Dr.  3/7/21: Return to ED. The patient is in no respiratory distress.  She has no wheezing.  On physical exam her throat lips and tongue look fine.  I think she is not a had another allergic reaction, rebounded from yesterday.  She is not on any type of steroids sinus syndrome with some Decadron.  And she is allergic to Benadryl but she can take Claritin if she wants.  Her CBC and chemistry were normal.  I went back to evaluate her and she still getting fluids and now she is complaining of shooting pain down her left leg from the EpiPen.  Again she has this regional complex pain syndrome that could be part of that but there is nothing I can do for this at this time.  In terms of her allergic reaction she feels much better her throat feels normal.  We will send her out with prescription for Decadron and EpiPen and if she gets worse she will come back and will follow up admit her.

                                                Most websites said 1-2 days for side effects to kick in but I was rocked pretty hard within the first 12 hours. The biggest symptoms I had were severe body aches, debilitating chills, fluctuating fever, headache, and no appetite.  4/1/21: * 11:15am: Vaccine administered * 12pm-6pm: Arm soreness, feeling cold/experiencing some chills, minor headache and stomach ache (I felt a little off but couldn?t tell if it was real or in my head) * 5:30pm: I walk home from work, which takes about about 35 minutes. Regret the decision about 10 mins from home due to onset body aches and fatigue  * 6pm: I go straight to bed freezing with crippling chills, body aches, and a headache * 8pm: Extreme nausea kicks in, I take Advil and cannot stomach more than one bite of food; still experiencing chills and body pain * 9pm: 100.7 fever, the chills subside and I start to get hot * 10:15pm: I finally eat some food, drink more water, body still aches, start to get chilly again  * 10:45pm: My fever is down to 99.3, my ears really hurt, like, ear-infection-style pain  * 11:15pm: 12ish hours post-vaccine, I have severe body aches, I alternate between really hot and cold, take more Advil and go to bed (finally fall asleep at midnight)  4/2/21: * 6:15am: Wake up; I spent the night tossing and turning with extreme night sweats. At this point I still have a pretty bad headache and painful body aches, specifically in my lower back and legs; fall back asleep * 8am-9am: Wake up and take more Advil. My whole body hurts. Toss and turn for a bit more. Small fever?99 degree temperature. Make coffee but have absolutely no appetite. * 9am-10am: So sweaty, fever is fully breaking * 11am: No more fever, slight headache, and body aches seem to be subsiding * 11:45am: Almost exactly 24 hours later and feeling good, comparatively speaking. Finally eat a bagel * 5:30pm: After lunch, I took a nap. My body aches have completely subsided, no fever. I still have a small headache and my ears still ache. But overall, I feel pretty normal! Just a little tired but probably from lack of sleep last night.

About 2days ago, I observed some tiny spots on my fingers (3 on middle finger, and 1 on ring finger - refer attached image). Also, at the same time I felt little disorientation where I was almost blank for just few seconds. I believe that might be due to empty stomach/low sugar. And then, I?m having a headache today.  After the vaccination, I had a fever of 102.7 degrees for about 2days.  I?m just concerned that this is nothing to worry about. And, if there are some blood tests or scans that I should get done just to be safe.

I got the typical muscle aches, chills, etc. In fact I got every side effect listed plus more. I want to discuss the other side effects. On day 3 I started to develop extreme chest pain and pressure. It is a dull pain as if someone if sitting on my chest that will not go away. I also started to experience sudden bouts of dizziness and vertigo. It will not go away. Today is Day 7 and I spent the night in the emergency room because my chest pains got so strong. However, all the work up came back okay. I also have this strange feeling of electrical shocks running thru my head, those last about .5 seconds and go away, but it is a very weird feeling I have never experienced. I also have a strange desire to constantly burp, when I do my chest pain feels better. If I don&#39;t burp my ears start to feel full and sometimes they ring. Its Day 7 and I still feel SO miserable. Why id no one speaking about these chest pains? I know 5 people who have experienced the same.

I had a slight droop on the l eft side of my face, mostly noticeable around the corner of my mouth. I also experienced itchiness around the injection site. The symptoms started with numbness in the tip of my tongue about 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine and slowly spread to the rest of my face. Approximately 5 hours after receiving the vaccine the entire left side of my face was numb. I called a nurse hotline to find out if I should seek medical care that night or wait until morning. They urged me to go to the ER.   I went to the ER, underwent a plethora of tests, received positive results on all of them, and was sent home with instructions to return if my condition worsened.

                                                Received dose on Monday 4/12 at 7:15am. Low grade fever, neck ache and chills developed that evening and went away by next morning.   On 4/16, woke up with almost no ability to hear out of my left ear and there was a very loud ringing sound in my ear. Happened off and on throughout the day but by evening, I only heard a ringing noise. I went to the urgent care and they said my ear had no sign of ear infection or allergies.   Next morning, I couldn?t hear almost anything out of my ear with a very loud ringing noise. Was consistent through 4:30pm that day.  Went back to the urgent care and a different nurse practicing confirmed my ear looked completely normal.  I?ve never experienced deafness or ringing in my ear before.    Since this morning (4/18) I have had a low ringing sound in my left ear, but no more deafness.

                                                Patient is a 32-year-old female new patient 5 months post partum &amp; currently breastfeeding, with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and history of childhood asthma, referred by the emergency department to discuss anaphylaxis like reaction to the Johnson Johnson COVID-19 vaccination on 4/28/21.  She received her vaccine around 2:00 p.m. She began developing itchiness in her palms/soles of feet and scalp that quickly developed into a a welt like rash about 3-1/2 hours after receiving the vaccine while on a walk with her husband; this was shortly followed by facial swelling over her right eye.  They made it home and she got in a cold shower to cool down, became dizzy, started seeing spots and had difficulty breathing. Her husband called EMS and she was hypotensive when they arrived.  She was given 2 doses of epinephrine (0.2 mg each per ED note) and a dose of Benadryl which helped. Shortly after the 2nd dose, she began having difficulty swallowing, maintaining the ability to breathe through her nose. She was given a 3rd dose of epinephrine and transferred to the ED; during transport an IV was started with an epinephrine drip. She was seen at Emergency Department; she was given IV fluids, solu medrol, tryptase level and had a normal EKG.  She was discharged with an epi pen prescription. Tryptase is still pending at the time of her visit. She started a new prenatal vitamin at 11 am 4/28/21. Otherwise, she reports no new foods, medications or topical products. She did eat before going on a walk, pepper jack cheese, wheat thins, and black bean hummus. She is pretty sure she was not stung by a bee prior to onset of symptoms yesterday.   Interestingly she reports recent urticarial episodes that occurred in February of 2021. These occurred when she was visiting her in-laws and occurred in the middle of the night, 2 nights in a row during the middle of her visit.  She has never had hives previously.  She reports no family history of hives or anaphylaxis.  She reports no use of new topical products or medications.

                                                About 2 minutes after receiving the vaccine, while parked, I started getting very light headed, felt dizzy, and my heart starting beating extremely fast, and then slowed down and started beating very very hard, and felt like it was going to pound out of my chest. I then had a warm sensation in my throat and started feeling like it was getting harder to breathe. I rolled down my Window, and looked for someone to wave over for assistance, but there were cars in the way, so I closed my eyes and focused on breathing deep and slowly to see if that would make it any better. After about 5 minutes my heart rate went back to normal, I felt I could breathe normally, and wasn&#39;t so light headed anymore. I should have reported this to someone when they told me I could leave, but I wasn&#39;t sure if it was an actual allergic reaction. Or if it was just a stress reaction. I felt like I should at least report it here, because I was completely fine before the injection, during the injection, and right after, until about 2 minutes after being parked.

                                                Severe menstrual cramping. I have never experienced physical pain like this in my life. My first cycle after the Jansen vaccine, I had an acute cramp attack that lasted about 15 minutes. This was in April. I almost asked my partner to take me to the hospital.   During the second cycle I had since being vaccinated, on the first day I started menstruating, I nearly fainted and was seeing stars while trying to get home. I had taken two Advil and this was not enough to help at all. I took two more shortly afterwards. The blinding pain lasted for 20-30 minutes. I can?t express the severity of this pain. It was unprecedented and terrifying.   The rest of my menstrual cycle is different as well. The first day was extremely heavy aside from being alarmingly painful, and then from the second day on, it was very light.  I also believe that I may have developed seasonal allergies post-vaccine as I have never had them in my life. I am currently struggling with this common discomfort.

I went to check on her and she said she was hot and started to close her eyes. I helped her to lay down and had technician get her a wet rag. Once she said she was ok we moved her out of the main aisle and let her lay with cold compress until she was feeling ok and her mother came to make sure she was ok.

                                                I had severe nausea and vomiting. I was very sensitive to smells (i.e.: jerk sauce, eggs). I started vomiting every hour from 1:30pm to 7pm the following day, Friday 3/12/21. After my first time vomiting I took two, 25mg MECLIZINE tablets but they did not help.  I could not keep anything down. I tried Water, Ginger Ale, Crackers, and Gatorade.  The all came back up within the hour. It got to the point where I was throwing up foam and green bile because my stomach was empty. I tried to eat again around 10pm and threw up again around 11:25pm. The following day, Saturday 3/13/21, I felt fine when I woke up until I started moving around. I threw up red vomit twice around midday and decided not to eat or drink anything and rest. Later that evening, around 7:30pm, I was able to eat a bland salad that didn&#39;t come back up. Today. 3/14/21, I am back to normal but my throat, stomach, and lower back are all sore from vomiting. I would NOT recommend this vaccine or get it again!

                                                Yesterday I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I was the last appointment, so they observed me for 5 minutes, and I left. After riding in the car for a few minutes, I noticed that I was having a hard time breathing and my throat felt like it was starting to swell. By that time, the clinic was closed, so I went to the emergency room just in case and sat in my car since they didn&#39;t allow people to sit in the waiting room because if covid.  It started becoming increasingly difficult to breathe, and I was feeling more and more swelling of my throat and tongue. I was having a lot of dizziness, nausea, facial flushing, palpitations, and some mild confusion. I then started getting numbness in the bottom half of my face. Over time, the numbness spread, mostly staying on the left side of my body (face, scalp, lower arms and legs, left side on tongue and inside of mouth). I also started getting a prickling burning pain sensation for brief periods of time where I had numbness. I had decided that if my breathing worsened at all, I would go to the er even though I can&#39;t afford it.   After about an hour and a half, my breathing started to feel less constricted and like there was less resistance. The swelling in my throat was mostly in the upper throat where I had difficulty swallowing but not as much difficulty breathing. The numbness continued to get worse and was sometimes disappearing and reappearing in the same spot.  At 9:30 pm we went to go get some benadryl. I continued feeling less and less swelling and having an easier time breathing. At that point, I went home. Once I was home, my breathing continued to improve and the numbness started to dissipate.  In the middle of the night, I started itching and getting widespread hives and getting a sharp burning pricking pain that would last a few seconds in different areas. The numbness also started coming back mostly in my face. I continued to have difficulty swallowing.  I am feeling much better today. I still feel some slight swelling in my throat when I swallow, but my breathing is fine. I&#39;m still itchy and occasionally breaking out in hives. Im having mild lower facial numbness. I&#39;m also starting to get the normal side effects of fever, headache, arm soreness, and body aches. I&#39;m taking benadryl every 4 hours.

                                                About a minute after I had the injection, my arm started hurting and it felt like hot water was coursing through my veins. I got an immediate headache that progressed into light headedness, my vision got blurry and I saw colors and then I started to lose my hearing, it felt like there was cotton in my ears. The nurses said I went pale and they called it a panic attack, but it was unlike any panic attack I have ever had in my life. I?ve had my TDAP updated a few years ago and got a flu shot and did not feel anything like this. I was rolled out of the room on a wheel chair because I was too dizzy to walk and then threw up several times into a bag and peed myself. It took about 20 minutes before I felt normal again.   The following day my arm felt numb and incredibly sore, I couldn?t raise it that far up without excruciating pain. I felt weak, fatigued and dizzy and was unable to use the bathroom. I had fever sweats and chills on and off. I was not able to sleep well, but I think that?s because of the pain in my arm.

Back of my eyes were heavy and painful. my right pinky started feel tingly, then both hands became very cold. Very similar symptoms to flu, except I didn&#39;t have any throat pain which I usually get when I&#39;m sick. I ate dinner at about 6:30pm and rested on the couch. I started feeling very hot, and was running the fever of 102.2 F. My arm and legs were tingly. I took advil at around 8pm which relieved some headache, but still feeling hot. Took shower and cutrently resting on the couch.

I have had a horrible nagging cough since having this shot. I got the shot on 3/14/21 ... it is now 1 month later and I still have it. I can be talking fine and then all of a sudden cough. I cough all day and all night. I never should have gotten this vaccine.  My cough will not go away. I am in the healthcare field which is why I got this injection and now I regret it. I also tested POSITIVE to COVID 1 week after getting the shot. I lost all sense of taste and smell and felt horrible. I got tested for COVID on 3/21 and found positive.

                                                Started with chills pretty shortly after the vaccine was injected.  After about 6 hours I could tell I was not feeling great.  My husband said I looked very pale and out of it all of the sudden.  I became extremely tired and disoriented.  I don?t remember driving myself home that evening after picking up my kids from dance.  By the time I was home it was now around 8 pm.  I was so cold my entire body was trembling.  I kept taking steaming hot showers but I couldn?t feel it, I was still freezing and shaking.  I was very weak and started having extremely horrible body aches and pains.  Specifically my legs were hurting the worst, I remember my hip joints felt like they?d buckle underneath me.  I got a headache that was unbearable.  It felt worse than a migraine.  It hurt to move my head or use my eyes at all.  I went to bed and was under several blankets and a heating pad while also running a space heater right next to me.  I still could not get warm at all.  I hallucinated that I could see each ache and pain on my body and watched them move through me.  By 4 am I was now hysterical and crying.  I was in so much unbearable pain and so scared.  I had to call off of work for this day.  I was so out of it I called my daughter off of school but also called for my mom to come get her and take her to school.  I kept my youngest home with me.  My head was still the absolute worst headache I have ever felt in my life.  I couldn?t open my eyes and it hurt to move at all.  I had to call a friend to come pick up my youngest daughter because I was unable to take care of her, I could barely stay awake and alert.  I tried another hot shower and everything still felt cold.  I was now nauseous from the head pain.  Around noon on this day I finally had the strength to drink some water and was able to take Tylenol.  I laid on the couch for hours still shivering and in unbearable pain.  I was still very scared that I was having such a bad reaction that I would die.  I called my husband to come home from work and be with me because I was scared.  I took more Tylenol a couple hours after the first dose.  Around 6 pm I started to feel better.  I was able to eat again that evening.  I had a headache though for about 3 weeks after that gradually weaned away.

My ears were slightly swollen and very red and itchy. At this point I took a good dose of benadryl . Before the benadryl kicked in, it had spread down my back, arms, and stomach. After the medicine had time to work my symptoms started going away and I was fine.

Vision slightly obscured, but I could still see. Applied a cold compress throughout the day and monitored for additional concerns. By the end of the day, the swelling subsided. By Monday, both eyes still felt pressure pain, but the swelling was significantly improved. Other side effects included the expected muscle soreness/aches, fatigue, and a mild rash around the vaccination spot. No additional adverse effects observed.

                                                I was very ill on Friday night after receiving the vaccination. Flu-like symptoms, high fever, shortness of breath, pain in my abdomen, horrible headache, nausea, dizziness, loss of consciousness and leg pain (both legs). The flu-like symptoms passed on Saturday, but by Tuesday, April 13 I was continuing to have a terrible headache, abdominal pain and leg pain. I saw my primary doctor on the 13th and was sent over to the hospital for an ultrasound of my leg. No clots were found and I was told to continue trying to recover at home unless it got worse. I was seen at the emergency room on April 14th for abdominal pain, leg pain, dizziness and headache. The nurse told me I was probably hysterical over the vaccination being pulled, and I told him this was not the case. They performed CT (without contrast) on my abdomen and head, then released me with instructions to return if I was worse. By the 16th I was unable to walk as my left side was completely numb. I went back to the ER. I had a CT of my abdomen and head with and without contrast. I had a lumbar puncture and several labs. I was given IV antibiotics for some infection they found in my urine. I was given fluids and pain meds, and my BP was shooting up to 145/94 (which is very high for me), when standing. My vision was blurry and I was unable to remember much of the last week. I was admitted from the 16th through the 20th and had an MRV, 2 MRIs, more lab work and medicine for my headache. I was released on the 20th and the headache was unbearable and I was still numb on my left side, going back to my doctor on the 22nd. He suggested the ER, and the ER admitted me back to the stroke unit. I was released on the 22nd with a diagnosis of a hemiplegic migraine that could cause stroke-like symptoms (ZERO history of headaches previously). I was sent home with a walker and home health services. PT visited on April 30th and ordered two visits per week for the next month. I am unable to walk without a walker. I cannot shower or use the stairs without assistance. My memory is still foggy. I am unable to concentrate for long. I often stutter and can&#39;t remember basic words. I have also stopped and forgotten where I am at a given moment. I am on Depakote nightly for the headaches, and they have lessened slightly, but when they flare up it is debilitating and I often vomit. I have instructions to follow up with my primary tomorrow morning and see what the next steps are.

Gave her water, crackers and cold/wet rags for her forehead as she felt hot. Took her temperature, returned normal. Gave her a trash can to keep near. Kept an eye on the patient and realized she was getting red in the face and more dizzy than she had been. Went out and stood next to patient, with her mom on her other side. Began to experience light sensitivity, feeling like the room was spinning. Patient almost fell out of the chair while sitting still. Mom used a personal pulse oximeter on patient, all results normal. Asked the patient about other symptoms, such as chest/abdominal/leg pain, headache, shortness of breath. Patient reported a headache, dizziness, nausea and leg numbness roughly 30 minutes following the vaccine. I recommended going to the ER, mom believed it would pass with time, but insisted she never responds this way to immunizations. Patient began to experience stabbing chest and abdominal pain around 45 minutes. Patient&#39;s mom was still hesitant to take her to the ER immediately on her own and asked us to call her PCP. He wanted the patient to go to the ER. Patient believed she would fall if she stood, offered to get a motorized cart, wheelchair or call an ambulance to transport her. Both patient and mom requested the ambulance. Asked a technician to check patient medications and allergies for EMTs, retook the patient&#39;s temperature which was normal again. Stayed with patient until EMTs arrived, reported all symptoms patient was experiencing.

                                                Patient was given her shot, she got up and sat down in the nearest observation chair, then immediately said she was dizzy and thought she was going to pass out. I went to her and she repeated that she was about to pass out. When her head started to roll back I was able to hold her by her shoulders. Her eyes rolled back and her head dropped back and she started convulsing. She lost consciousness for about 10 seconds. When she came to she didn&#39;t know what was happening. She was very sweaty by this time. I asked if she had a history of seizures or had ever fainted before and she answered no. EMS was called. I checked her BP and it was 84/41. The patient tried to stand to assist with finding her husband in the store but I told her she had to sit until EMS arrive. We offered her water and orange juice and she asked for both. When the husband got there we asked him if she has a history of fainting or seizures and he said this has happened multiple times, mostly as a result of seeing blood. He said she hasn&#39;t had seizures but she has had tremors when this has happened. I checked her BP again and it was 116/88. She was feeling a lot better. EMS arrived and she was stable by that point. They recommended that she go to the hospital, but patient opted not to go.

The only thing different in my body was the Janssen Vaccine. Midway through my IV I started itching, numbness in my fingers, lips, and feet. My face was on fire and my tongue was swelling and I could feel my throat closing. My arms turned red and blotchy and swelled. My nurse stopped the Benlysta and started Benadryl and a saline flush. The symptoms then went away.

As the day went on, the rash progressed to cover my entire body.  I went to the ER around 2 pm where I received a steroid injection and was prescribed oral steroids.  I was fatigued for the next two days, but was able to return to work on 4/12/21.  The rash began subsiding, but overall lasted 2-3 weeks.

I returned to the ER where they prescribed me another round of steroids, but a lower dose and a longer duration.  I experienced fatigue for 6 weeks after receiving the vaccine.

                                                Right eye lid swelled up within 24 hours of the shot and is still an issue as of this submission.  Some days the swelling has been severe some days and less severe, but the swelling has never fully gone away in the last two months. The swelling can include the eyelid, the skin between the lid and the brow, and below the eye . The eyelid and skin near brow will often turn pink/purple. Beyond the swelling pain, no major main. Some pain on outer eye bone for both eyes.  The swelling seems to get worse when I  sleep longer or lay down horizontal.  When I go to sleep propped up, the swelling is less severe. Or, if I sleep for 7 or less hours, sometimes the swelling can be less.

At around 9:00 PM I had chills, migraine, bodyaches, burning sensation in my joints, neck pain, and a low-grade fever. I took some Tylenol at around 7 PM. But the pain did not subside and I was able to use the bathroom the next day at around 4 AM and was still in severe pain. That day at around 1 PM I was able to set up and felt 30% better. On day two I am feeling better but I still have minor body aches I do get fatigue while doing light work around the house and no appetite and loss of taste is the newest symptom. I am not 100 percent better but close to it.

                                                I had some sort of reaction to the vaccine about 1-2 minutes after receiving it, and it was super scary and they had to call the paramedics.   After the pharmacist injected me, I felt the arm pain right away. No big deal. I walked over to the chair to sit for my 15 minutes. I was happy to be vaccinated and kind of saw it as my mini booster for my immune system that already beat COVID-19. As I sat there, the only thing I could say is, I felt a tingling cold sensation moving from my arm through me. Almost like I could feel the vaccine moving through my system. The tingling kept moving and I thought to myself, okay cool. I guess it&#39;s working. Awesome. But then my head felt cold, I felt tingling in my head, my mouth tasted like metal, saliva started to build in my mouth, I started to sweat, I felt overly sweaty all over my body, but my head felt cold and tingly.   I was staring straight ahead and everything started to go staticky, like a television set, and the static began to build and started to get starry. Everything in my vision started to fade. So I spoke out to say something weird was happening.  A man came over to talk to me and hold me up. He kept saying stuff but then my ears started ringing and I couldn&#39;t hear him anymore. I began to fade out as the stars got more intense. Then, as if it was just a mini reboot, my brain started to come back online and the picture in front of me began to fade back into view. I felt nauseous and still had a super metal taste in my mouth. They called the paramedics to give me a checkup. The metal taste in my mouth stayed the longest, but after about 45 minutes I felt well enough to go home.  On and off, I have this intense tingling inside my brain. It reminds me of a time when I was in the hospital on morphine. Just a tingling pins and needles sensation inside my head. Other than that, I am okay now. But I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s some sort of reaction because I already had COVID-19.

Mom brought patient to me for assessment. When patient presented to me, patient was alert and vitals were normal. I asked patient to remain seated for 15 more minutes of observation.  Mom did say patient exhibited this behavior once before at the eye doctor.  I informed mom to please check with patients doctor for follow up. Patient exhibited some mental disability and thats is why the mother is involved. I dont believe patient is capable of taking care of herself.

                                                Around 5.5 hours after I got the shot my blood sugar bottomed out. I had a hot flash, started sweating and my vision went blurry. I couldn?t walk 3 feet without having to sit with my head between my knees. I passed out in a 5 foot walk but luckily i sat down on my couch as it was happening. I?m not diabetic, haven?t ever been hypoglycemic. Ibuprofen and food after about 2 or 3 hours is a must.

                                                4/8/21:  I receive the injection at 1:50pm on my left arm.  8pm: I begin experiencing normal side effects: soreness, body aches, and headache.  9pm: In addition to the soreness, body aches, and headache, I start having chills, which last on and off throughout the night. 4/9/21:  7am: I feel fatigued, with headache and body aches throughout the morning and afternoon. 3pm: I begin to have some itchiness on my forehead and both ears. My right knee cap feels hot and bruised, but there is no mark. 5pm: Visible hives appear on my forehead and right knee cap, and my ears are red. All of these spots are very itchy and uncomfortable.  9pm: The hives begin to be much more noticeable and itchier. I take one Benadryl before going to bed which helps the itchiness somewhat. 4/10/21  3:30am: I am woken up by pain in my ears and they have gotten incredible swollen, red, and hot. They are very tender to the touch. I take another tablet of Benadryl.  7am: There are more hives on my forehead and cheeks, as well as my knee and now on two of my fingers. A few spots also appear on my feet and on one toe. My ears are less swollen but still not back to normal, and they are still red, hot and tender.  9am: I have a video call with a Physician?s Assistant who determines it is most likely not an anaphylactic reaction (no swelling in my throat or eyes or any of the other red flag symptoms. I also take my blood pressure with a home monitor and it is normal). He prescribes me a steroid pack.  12pm: The hives begin to be less and less itchy and red.  8pm: The hives are almost completely gone, save for a few spots on my feet. As I am breastfeeding my 14-month-old daughter, I had waited to begin the steroid pack until after our last nursing session of the day (around 7:30pm). As the hives seemed to be going away on their own, I decide to not take the medication. I do take one dose of Zyrtec. 4/11/21:  7am: the hives are completely gone

                                                I received the vaccine at noon on Saturday. 12 hours later I experienced severe chills and body aches which lasted 12 hours. Late afternoon on Monday I began experience sharp pains on the left side of my head, in my left inner ear, my left temple, behind my eye and above my eye to the upper part of my left forehead. At one point in the evening, it hurt to move my eye . These pains have persisted. I took 800mg of Ibuprofen on Tuesday morning, which took away the sharp pain but there is still a dull pain/feeling of pressure behind and around my left eye and ear. The eye feels dry and sore when I blink. I called a doctor and they felt it could be a migraine. As someone who suffered from migraines in the past, it doesn&#39;t feel like one.

                                                I received the vaccination 4/2/21 at 11am and at about 6pm the same day - I felt a sudden flush and felt like I was going to faint in the middle of Grocery store. Got very clammy and sweaty and weak - immediately left the store and started projectile vomiting outside the store and all night the first night. Had extremely joint/bone pain throughout my entire body for 4 days straight in bed, very weak, chills and night sweats, day 2 I had a little energy and drove about an hour and immediately started vomiting again  for day 2-day 5. Day 5 I woke up with swollen eye lids and hands and thought it was an allergic reaction to something in my house so took benedryl, but didn?t help. The swelling went down on day 6. I?ve had no energy and very foggy brain and been very down. My chest has felt like an anxiety attack 24/7 all week. I am on day 10 since the vaccination and my chest pain has increased. I still have foggy brain and been very out of it and weak still. I vomited day 1-day 5. Really bad pain in my hips and arm where I received the shot.

                                                As I was driving home my tongue started to feel tingling, my upper lip area felt like it was swelling but I was going numb, the roof of my mouth starting numbing as well, and when I tried to swallow my saliva there was a bit of difficulty. The reaction did not worsen. From a 1 to 10, ten being bad, the reaction was a 3. I had no difficulties breathing. The numbness went away after about 30 minutes.   The following day: chills, light fever 100.2F, stomach pain, loose stool, and fatigue.

Since then I have had incredible headaches almost daily, lasting a few hours (I have been taking Tylenol for the headaches).  Usually headaches are after 5pm, I will feel dizzy, foggy, and intense pressure, some blurred vision. I do not have a history of migraines or headaches, I have been taking the Tylenol, drinking lots of water, and taking baths to try and help with them.

The patient&#39;s weight and height were not reported. The patient medical history included being 4 months post-partum. The patient had no drug, food or other product allergies, and had no chronic or long-standing conditions. The patient received COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S (suspension for injection, route of administration and batch number not reported), dose was not reported, administered on 23-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported. From an unspecified date, the patient had 2 weeks of headaches and blurry vision, 2 to 3 days of neck stiffness and nausea with 1 episode of vomiting and had been transferred to the current hospital from another. On 04-APR-2021 (12 days post-vaccination), the patient was diagnosed with dural venous sinus thrombosis (DVST), transverse/sigmoid (cerebral venous) sinus thrombus (CVST) with associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe as well as thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein (thrombus). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) impressions showed there was a re-demonstrated of intraparenchymal hematoma in the right posterior temporal lobe measuring approximately 6.2 x 3.6 cm in maximal axial dimensions. There was surrounding edema and associated mass effect with effacement of the right temporal horn and right-to-left midline shift measuring 5 mm. There was medialization of the right uncus without transtentorial herniation. The basal cisterns were otherwise patent. There was dural thickening and hyperenhancement overlying the hemorrhage. There was prominent cortical veins along the right frontal temporoparietal convexity consistent with venous congestion. There was also a small are of vasogenic edema in the right anterior temporal lobe separate from the hematoma. There was a right mastoid effusion, but normal orbitals and the calvarium and skull base were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) results revealed non-opacification of the torcula, right transverse sinus, right sigmoid sinus and upper internal jugular vein compatible with occlusive thrombosis. A small amount of thrombus also extended into the left transverse sinus. The superior sagittal sinus, remainder of the left transverse sinus, left sigmoid sinus, left upper internal jugular vein, straight sinus, vein of Galen and bilateral internal cerebral veins demonstrated normal contrast opacification. The patient&#39;s platelet count was 126 upon admission (normal range [NR] not provided), with other workup laboratory test results reported as pending. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S was not applicable. The outcome of the right internal jugular thrombus, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, DVST, CVST, headache, blurry vision, neck stiffness, nausea and vomiting was reported as unknown. This report was serious (caused/prolonged hospitalization and other medically important condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This case concerns a 34-year-old white female who experienced cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), dural venous sinus thrombosis, right internal jugular vein thrombosis, and cerebral hemorrhage 12 days after receiving covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s for prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The patient was noted to be 4 months post-partum. She presented for medical assistance with a 2-week history of headaches, blurry vision, and neck stiffness for 2 to 3 days as well as nausea with 1 episode of vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large hematoma in the right posterior temporal lobe with surrounding edema and associated mass effect resulting in effacement of the right temporal horn and right-to-left midline shift measuring 5 mm and occlusive thrombus within the torcula, right transverse sinus, right sigmoid sinus, and upper internal jugular vein.  A small amount of thrombus extended into the medial aspect of the left transverse sinus. The platelet count on admission was 126,000. Although the post-partum status of the patient may have contributed, based on evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS, per definition from Brighton Collaboration) and considering the low platelet count and temporal relationship to vaccination, we consider the events to have a plausible relationship with vaccination.

Over the next few days they continued to weep. They stopped weeping and were crusty, and then the crust came off on the Wednesday after it began. My lips were still sore and sensitive, but were back to normal about 10 days later. Doctor prescribed an antiviral (vircyclovir) for cold sore but I don&#39;t think it was a cold sore. I actually did develop a cold sore on my bottom lip 2 weeks after the initial lip issue.

After 12 hours, nausea and headache set in. 13-14 hours, a terrible stomachache and diarrhea. My skin felt so sensitive that it hurt to touch. Zofran treated the nausea. The day after the injection I was exhausted, was nauseous and had a headache. 48 hours after injection I woke up with a strange headache. I could look to the right pain free, but if I looked to the left or left/up, I had a piercing pain near my right eye. Excedrin/Tylenol did not relieve this headache. On Hour 72, the headache is still present, though to a lesser degree.

I had seasonal allergies occurring that day, so I kept eating a bit longer. My tongue then started tingling. I took a dose of Children&#39;s Benadryl (all I had for Benadryl at the time). I then waited about 10 minutes before I felt my throat starting to close. We headed straight to emergency room (5 mins away). By the time I got there, I started to have a little trouble taking breaths. When I got into the trauma room moments later, I became nauseous and dry heaving.  They gave me an epinephrine shot, Benadryl, Pepto, and Prednisone.   They watched me for a few hours before release. Upon discharge, they provided me a prescription for epi-pens, famotidine, prednisone, and fexofenadine (5-day prescriptions).

My hips and lower back muscles cramped so quickly I couldnt walk.  Severe headache with eye pain, light sensitivity and nausea.  I woke up early the next day to severe nausea and vomiting, migraine, muscle and joint pain.  My fever was normal by 4pm, but migraine, muscle and joint pain and nausea still bad. I could not leave bed for entire day.

                                                I took the Johnson and Johnson vaccine on March 6th. The following day my left arm was sore and my right ear was hurting. On March 10th I went to my doctor office because my right ear pain would not go away. The NP diagnosed me with having trigeminal neuralgia. She subscribed me some nerve pill to take two times a day. On March 17th I went to my dentist complaining that my lower right side of my teeth was hurting me. He took x rays and didn?t see anything, but did an unnecessary filings on my top right side of my teeth which cost me $149. I got in my car and called the NP complaining that my teeth was hurting me. She said it?s because of that trigeminal nerve that goes from the ear to the mouth which is causing the trigeminal neuralgia. She said it?s okay to take one nerve pill in the morning and two at night. That Saturday, March 20th I couldn?t sleep and was in excruciating pain. I went to the ER to see if they could give me any relief. The ER doctor did a CT and which confirm I do have trigeminal neuralgia. He referred me to a neurosurgeon. I finally got an appointment with the neurosurgeon on Friday, April 16th. On April 3rd I was in so much pain again. I called my doctor office and she up the nerve pill that I can take up to 4 times a day if needed. So now I take 4 nerve pills a day along with ibuprofen and extra strength pain reliever pill.

The last one (no taste/smell), is the most unusual, I&#39;v never had this before.

I refused further medical care because I felt better once the ambulance arrived. I visited my primary care doctor on 4/13/2021 to follow up.  He said it was likely an occular migraine.  A blood test was ordered and results came back as essentially normal.  I have been continuing to have dizzy spells, headaches, blurry vision and light sensitivity. An MRI of my  brain and spinal cord has been ordered for 4/29 to rule out other conditions.

                                                On 04/10/2021 I had a severe pressure headache that lasted the entire day which led me to tears.  The headache was so severe I felt if you drilled a hole in the top of my head air would spew out.  Additionally, on 04/10/21 I had soreness in the injection site, some pain in the right shoulder blade which felt like an inflamed bursa, some fatigue,&#43; dehydration (cotton mouth-dry tongue). After 04/10/21-todayI have had mild headaches occasionally during the week. I had started to have a mild cough since 04/22/21.

Headache for 3 days (above right eye, caused some vision changes), then sore throat, cough, brain fog, difficulty sleeping, along with body aches continuing.  Currently on day 13 and still have sore throat, coughing, brain fog, difficulty sleeping, muscle aches, congestion.  Also on day 3, eczema has been building on my face/neck.  Eczema has continued to get worse each day.  when I got the shot, I communicated to the nurse, I was maybe pregnant.  it was too soon to test.  That was Friday.  I had a positive pregnancy test the following Tuesday.  I&#39;ve since taken 2 more tests that were positive and have missed my period.  So safe to say i&#39;m pregnant.

                                                The day within 10 minutes I started feeling hot and feverish. Then I started to feel lumping and cramping in my left breast and it persists and it turned in to nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. I also felt body cramping and both of breasts became extremely hard and was not comfortable. I also had muscle aches along with a mild fever for about a week. The pain was persistent. Then on day 2, the headaches started and I couldn&#39;t sleep because every time I moved the headache would cause me to vomit. So, I couldn&#39;t. My vision was blurry and I was not sure if it was due to the headache or the vaccine. I ended up going to the ER on 05/16/2021  for cramping in my left leg which was down by my ankle and was bruised. I&#39;m still experiencing heart palpitations, tiredness, cramps still happen in my breasts,  and there are still moments when my vision goes in and out.

                                                Within a couple minutes, I had a shooting pain in my left ear - that went away in 30 seconds. And then that evening, about 6 hours after, I was achy, had the chills, I had sweats and I was incredibly tired. That lasted for about 36 hours. My headache didn&#39;t go away - it wasn&#39;t on my forehead, it was on the back of my head. That headache didn&#39;t go away for two weeks - four weeks. It was really painful. Around that Monday or Tuesday,  after the vaccine, I started getting the ringing in my ear. If you go to a concert - loud music venue - and you come home and your ears are ringing. That is how it is all the time/consistent ringing and it&#39;s only in my right ear.  My head hurt so badly, I don&#39;t know if it was Monday or Tuesday for when it started. I had a virtual appt with Primary Care Doctor - he said that there had been reports of Tinnitus from after the vaccine. He recommended not to do J&amp;J again - if they do a booster. If you make a line from  top of one ear to to top of other ear - all that area was excruciating pain on the back of my head. I had massages for it and had them work on my head to help the pain.

By 6:30 I felt like my body was burning up on the inside but had no fever. My muscles in my neck became extremely tight and my ears aches. The injection site is extremely tender and hurts to lift my arm. As of 11 am the next day I have also added diarrhea to the list of symptoms.

They eventually after monitoring me for awhile sent me down to ER, by then my voice was raspy and scratchy, my lower lip was big, my tongue still felt big. I still felt nauseous. The dr asked me if my eyes are usually swollen and red and I said no. My extremities were still numb and tingling. I got epi and other drugs, zofran, benadryl, pepcid, I think a dose of steroids. The symptoms continued so I ended up getting a 2nd dose of epi. I went home around 5pm. When I woke up that evening to do a neb treatment I was nauseous, my lower lip again big, my tongue felt thick and this time my upper throat felt swollen, I gave myself epi and took myself to ER, they monitored me for 3 hrs the dr was gonna hospitalize me if I got worse, I still felt nauseous and the numbness and tingling feeling in my hands and feet when I left but was not having any airway issues when I left. Not sure if the numbness/tingly is gonna go away in my hands and feet.

On her vaccination list she stated that she is allergic to many thing including some foods and medication. She stated that her doctor still wants her to receive it due to her condition(immune system disorder). She came with her husband. They had a case with medications in case she experiences reaction. He had Benadryl and EpiPen in his case. First 15 minutes she was feeling fine, on the 25-30 min I asked them how was she doing and husband said she is not feeling very good. we measured her heart rate and it was around 150bpm.  Husband said her lips and tongue  are starting to swell. I asked him if they want me to call 911 but he refused. He preferred to take her home and observe. I called to check on patient few hours ago. He told me she was stable but her tongue is still swollen. I told them to go to ER if the symptoms get worse. He said she is improving and feeling better now

                                                started with drowsiness and no appetite, chills came on but nothing serious but within 1 hour the chills became very intense and I couldnt  warm up or take it. I had sweatpants, two sweatshirts, slippers and 2 blankets on to help. Later on I had fallen asleep to wake my husband to uncontrollable laughter and crying, mentally I knew what I was doing was not right but I couldn&#39;t control it. I believe my feve may had spiked so high that it was border line hysteria. By morning I woke and the fever had broke however I still had no appetite, terrible headache along with weakness and fatigue....I also tried food but ended up spitting it out because everything tasted strongly of metal. Sunday I was back to tasting to food and more energy.

                                                Started having blurry vision/trouble focusing eyes/feeling dizzy on Monday. By Wednesday, this was very difficult to handle and I went to see a practicioner at my primary care office and I could not sleep at all on Wednesday night; went to the ER on Thursday morning out of major concern.

But then on Monday I noticed a very tender left armpit, and I also have very itchy eyes, something I never have.  I also developed a small purple patch on my leg, and a little skin sore on my left arm.  It looks like more may be developing.

I got hot and sweaty and horrible tunnel vision, I almost fainted. I laid down on one of their medical beds to recover while the sweet nurse fanned me.  I was observed over 30 min before leaving.  I woke up yesterday and felt weird along with bodyaches, chills, joint pains, random stinging sensations throughout my body (almost like a pen prick), sporadic short headaches and muscle cramps.  I left work yesterday and didn?t even go in today.

                                                I experienced tiredness a couple hours after receiving the vaccine. Shortly after, body ache set in. The following morning, I woke up with body ache and developed a headache soon after. The headache lasted all day. It became difficult to focus on anything else. I remember I couldn&#39;t even look at my phone screen because it hurt to do so. At times, I felt like the room was spinning around me. Later that night, I checked my temperature and had a slight fever, but it was only a degree or so higher than my normal temperature. I also experienced some chills throughout the evening. I went to bed early that night and woke up feeling like a brand new person with no remaining symptoms.

                                                Once my vaccine was administered I felt tingling on my tongue and bottom lip. I waited the 15 minutes and felt that the tingling was diminishing. I spoke to the tech and felt ok to leave since I was not experiencing loss of breath or swelling. After about 3 hours I noticed the tingling sensation coming back. I immediately called the pharmacist who administered the shot. After explaining the tingling was mostly felt on my lips and tongue but had no swelling and could breath and swallow just fine. I explained that it felt like when you get a shot for Dental work and that every time I touched the area it would tingle more. He told me that was not a normal reaction and would call in a few hours to check in on me. Sometime around 7 we spoke again and I still had no changes with the tingling. Again, he said he would have the pharmacist who was in call again the next day to make sure I was ok. By 11:30pm the aches in my joints started and I had chills. I woke up for work at 3:25am and noticed the tingling sensation wasn&#39;t as strong as the day before. Once I ate the tingling became more noticeable and was mostly on the right side of my tongue and throat. I also started experiencing a headache and sinus pressure. After arriving I work by 6am I felt exhausted. As the day went on the exhaustion  was becoming so strong I felt that I was fighting to keep my eyes open. The aches in my joints were becoming more intense especially in my hips and hands. At times I felt it hard to hold anything in my hand as closing my fingers became so painful it brought tears to my eyes. I also notice I was sweating profusely but had no fever. Once I was home I took a 2 hour nap. I woke up feeling the same the tingling in my mouth, aches still noticeable and headache still there. I could not stand and even tried to eat but had a loss of appetite. I called the pharmacy and reported the tingling was still noticeable. The pharmacist on duty explained the aches were normal but the tingling was not. I was advised to seek medical attention if I had trouble breathing or had swelling. The pharmacist told me to keep up on rest and fluids and I would recieve another call tomorrow to see how I was feeling. It&#39;s now 9:28pm and there are no changes to the tingling sensation in my mouth/throat. I still have aches and pains that are radiating throughout my body. My headache is still there but not as strong as this morning and I now have ringing in my ears. Every once in awhile I get some good stomach pains but they last a minute or two before going away.

                                                On Thursday, April 8, 2021, between 915 and 945 AM, I received the Janssen/Johnson &amp; Johnson single dose COVID-19 Vaccine. As I have had adverse reactions to vaccines in the past, I was advised to wait at the vaccination site for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, and I did. Approximately 2 hours after receiving the vaccine in my left arm, I developed a red lacey-type rash all over my body. (This rash still persists today, Tuesday, April 13, 2021 at 3:37 PM and is relieved temporarily with consistent doses of Benadryl capsules, liquid or tablets.)  On Thursday night (April 8), after receiving the vaccine, I began to have body aches and to feel fatigued around 7:30 PM. I took 50 mg Benadryl, 500 mg acetaminophen, 800mg ibuprofen and went to bed. I woke around 12:30 AM and was drenched in sweat and my clothes were wet with sweat. I urinated and went back to bed and was shivering uncontrollably from the time I got out of bed until I got back in the bed and bundled up?it was several minutes before the shivering stopped and I went back to sleep. At approximately 2 AM, I woke up to urinate again. I had a terrible headache, like my head was in a vice; my tongue, throat, and nasal passages were very swollen, and it was difficult to breathe through my nose at all. I took an additional 50 mg of Benadryl and a 500mg acetaminophen and went back to bed. On Friday morning I woke to a phone call from work checking on me. I had slept through all of my alarms and it was 8:35 AM. I was unable to report to work that day and went back to sleep and slept for most of the day, only getting up occasionally to get a drink and use the bathroom. That evening I was able to get up and do a few things with the children and run to the grocery store, however, I became very fatigued and went to bed early without eating dinner.  On Saturday morning, when I woke up, I realized that I had slept for over 12 hours. I was groggy and fatigued all day and had a nap in the afternoon. That evening I was able to participate in family movie night and was feeling ok until about 10 PM. At that time, I began to feel very nauseated and had diarrhea, even though I had not eaten anything that would upset my stomach. I had intense abdominal cramping and felt like I would vomit if I moved around too much. I went to bed and had to get up to use the bathroom with diarrhea at least twice after the initial symptoms at about 10 PM.  On Sunday morning, I woke up after sleeping approximately 10 hours and was able to get up without feeling too fatigued. I did chores and errands and began to feel fatigued in the afternoon and took a nap for about 2 hours. That evening I also had to rush to the bathroom with diarrhea, however, there was no nausea. I went to bed at about 10 PM. On Monday morning, when I woke up, I felt very groggy and did not feel like I had gotten enough sleep. By the evening on Monday, however, I had begun to feel a little less fatigued and more clear-headed. As of Tuesday, April 13, 2021, I have had the red lacey-looking rash intermittently since having the vaccine. I am already on several OTC allergy medications for seasonal allergies and continue to take those medications, however, I have increased my Benadryl intake from 25 mg in the morning to 50 mg in the mornings with 25 -50 mg every 6 hours or so, as well. The rash improves for a short time while I am taking the Benadryl, but it reappears within a few hours after taking the Benadryl.

About 3 days ago I started getting a major headache on the right side that also arrived with blurry vision, mental fog and mild dizziness. Nausea yesterday and today except the headache was much worse. I cried from the pain and this is when I became more concerned. My eyes, mainly the right side and a pressure in my sinuses were very difficult to bare with, subsided some with multiple doses of ibuprofen and Advil sinus but not by much. The headache is unbearable, painful to stand out bend over or move.

                                                On March 13th, 2021 I was given the opportunity to receive the Janssen Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid 19 vaccine so I decided to go ahead and get vaccinated.  Within 1.5 hours of receiving the vaccine, I began to feel unwell. It started with my left leg going numb. From there symptoms continued to increase. I got very tired could hardly stay awake. Then the chills hit. I could not get warm.  By the next morning (Sunday day 2) I had developed a low fever, headache, body aches and whole body weakness. I could still hardly stay awake still. When I was awake, I was very dizzy and I felt like everything around me was moving but I was not. My left leg still felt numb but I thought it would pass on its own.. Because of how I felt, I just laid around and rested. My injection site was swollen, Red and extremely hot to touch.  Next comes Monday (day 3), I got up that morning, still not feeling well. I made my way to work. That did not go well. The more I moved, the worse I felt. I was completely unbalanced and looked like I was drunk. I couldn&#39;t walk straight, I had to randomly grab onto chairs and sit down. I was feeling weaker by the minute. I left work at that point and went to see my primary physician that afternoon. At this point I could see straight to drive myself, could hardly walk as my left leg now dragged. I had no balance and having lots of dizzy spells at this point. He suggested I head to th ER but eventually decided we could wait until morning to see if things improved at all. If no improvement,  I was to go to ER. Tuesday Morning (day 4), my husband took me to the emergency room. I had reached the point of not being able to walk unassisted. At this point, the weakness and numbness I had on my left, had spread to my right side. We had no idea what was happening. We got right in and discussed what was going on. What lead up to me being there, etc. The ER ran blood work, xrays of my chest and 3 different MRIs trying to figure out if something happened like a stroke. NOTHING was present on any test they did yet there was something obviously wrong with me. My arm was still very Red and hot.. I had developed a lump in my arm where the vaccine was given. After ruling out everything the doctor could think of, he consulted with the on call neurologist since it was obvious to him something was happening with my neurological system. The diagnosis...my body was taking the vaccine as a toxin causing my neurological system to react and shut down. They felt that I should be starting feel better in the next few days as the vaccine settles into my system. I was told to follow up with a neurologist and my primary. I was then discharged from the hospital in the condition I had arrived.  Wednesday (day 5) I spent the day at home, not able to do anything. I napped most of the day. I still felt like crap and had no idea when I would start feeling better. No improvement that day.  Thursday (day 6) I woke up feeling a bit better. My right side was beginning to feel normal again but I was still feeling weak and unbalanced. This is also the day I meet with a neurologist to follow up. I don&#39;t know that this appointment had accomplished much as she didn&#39;t have access to all my medical records. She ended up prescribing me a medication to help with nerve pain I was having in my left side and referred me to do physical therapy. I am to follow up in 2 months.  Friday (day 7) my right side is back to pre-vaccine stage. My left is not. I feel pretty good except the occasional dizzy spell and the fact my left isn&#39;t working yet.  Day 8 and beyond...I&#39;m feeling ok. I went back to work but still have issues with my left side and residual dizzy spells. I began physical therapy 2 days a week to work on strengthening my left side however it has yet to help.  I am now just over 4 weeks post covid vaccine. I am now using a cane to help me walk as my left side has still not returned to normal. It is unknown if it will. I&#39;m in Physical therapy 2x a week still. The lump at injection site is now the size of a pea. I still have moments of unbalanced feeling and dizzy spells.

I continue to take Tylenol every 6 hours until persists as directed by the RN that administered the vaccine.   Some side effects have lessened, others have not, and the rest seem to be slightly dissipating.

                                                Patient had a reaction immediately after the JJ vaccine. Patient passed out for 10-15seconds, her body stiffened up, she felt hot and then cold and started sweating excessively. Patients eyes closed briefly and then opened. Patient then became conscious and was unware what had happened.  Patient is not on any medication and had not eaten all morning. After administering the vaccine a small amount of blood came out. I gave her a cotton ball to apply on the area and to hold. After 20-30 seconds she said she felt faint and hot all of a sudden. Her body then went limp and her eyes began to close. Her body then stiffened up for a few seconds. After shouting her name a few times she regained consciousness and was able to talk. she didn&#39;t realize what had happened. Her body was fine again but she had urinated during the episode.  Upon speaking to the patient I learnt that she was nervous about the vaccination and she had felt dizzy in the past when giving blood. I observed the patient over the next 45 minutes. Her speech was fine, she was still a little light headed. She was in her seat for 40 minutes, then I asked her to stand and to move a little to see how she was. She was able to walk a bit but then sat down as she still felt light headed. She than sipped on water and continued talking and seemed to get some energy back.

                                                I was taking a shower the night of 04/28/21 and I had a bad pain in my right leg. It felt like it could be a blood clot. The area was swollen and I was in a lot of pain. My blood pressure started getting high and it kept going up. On the way to the hospital, I started getting a headache and shortness of breath. I tried to elevate my leg on the way there. I took an aspirin. I had to sit in the waiting room for 2 1/2 hours and my pain in my leg and headache continued. Once I was taken back, they ran a few tests. I was told that my D-Dimer was elevated which indicates a blood clot. I was checked for a pulmonary embolism and that was negative. I was given a blood thinner because an ultrasound technician was not on duty. I went home at 4 am. I went back for an ultrasound the next day for my entire leg. Everything came back normal. The pain slowly went away.

I, staff RPh, assessed patient quickly and helped her to a supine position on the floor with legs elevated. Patient fainted as she was being helped to the floor. Patient&#39;s eyes was dilated, we called 911 and I grabbed the BP unit and checked pulse. Pt regained consciousness after about 7 to 8 seconds. Pt was able to identify herself and answer all questions. We grabbed an orange juice for the patient as she had not had anything to eat and had just worked out. Pt&#39;s BP was 108/90 and remained around that range for about 5 or so readings. PT drank and was encouraged to lie in supine position with legs elevated for 15 more minutes even though she stated she thought she was fine. Pt waited until 12:55pm and also stated she had fainted with a past blood draw. Pt appeared fine by 12:55pm, bp still around 100/80, pupils is back to normal. 911 was cancelled per patients request shortly after regaining consciousness.

On Tuesday the 18th I had a slight fever, so I went to the walk-in clinic to be assessed and tested for COVID19 to make sure it wasn&#39;t that. The APN explained that I was experiencing seasonal/environmental allergies after having worked outside on May 16th and 17th. I have never had allergies before and it felt like I was coming down with a cold of some kind, so I wanted to be assessed and ensure I wouldn&#39;t get anyone else sick. The APN agreed the slight fever (99.6) was atypical and she understood why I came in. She prescribed allergy eye drops and nasal spray and told me to take an OTC allergy medication. I have continued to experience some allergy symptoms (runny nose, congestion, burning eyes) even after 2 weeks of taking medication. I am unsure if my immune system has changed as a result of having COVID19 in April 2020 or a reaction to the vaccine.

Went to check on patient a minute later and her eyes were fluttering and her breathing altered. She did not respond to me. Her pupils dilated dramatically and she slumped over. I called for a nurse and we lowered her to the floor together. Blood pressure was low (around 100/60) Her pupils started to return to normal and she was able to converse with us. Blood pressure increased slightly but was erratic. Emergency service responders made call to take to hospital because blood pressure would not stabilize

                                                I received the vaccine at approximately 4:35 PM. I got a headache around 9:30 PM and took Tylenol at that time. I started getting very cold and shaking around 10:00 PM. My finger nails and lips started getting pale and my temperature started rising. The shaking stopped around 12:15 AM, but my fever continued as high as 101.4 throughout the night and into the morning. I continued taking Tylenol and the fever went away the morning of 3/12/21, but slight chills returned around noon that did not last long. I took more Tylenol that evening for a headache and noticed I had an on and off throbbing pain in my right ear.

                                                Janssen COVID-10 Vaccine EUA  About 5- 10 minutes after the vaccine, I started getting numbness in my left hand and my ears began getting hot. By the 25 minute mark, I noticed numbness in my cheeks, around my mouth and my forehead. I turned around and went back to the Health Department for observation. I sat with a nurse until I passed the hour mark for after the vaccine had been given. By that point, the numbness was gone around my mouth and forehead, but the numbness remained in my cheeks and they were visibly red where they were numb. At this point, I left the health department because my symptoms were getting better. It took about 2.5 hours for the numbness to gone in my cheeks.

                                                Approximately 9 hours after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA, I experienced sudden fatigue followed by onset of severe muscle and joint pain including severe head pain followed by severe chills followed by fever and excessive sweating. I was very dizzy and felt disoriented. I was in bed when all this happened and was already wearing warm clothes under the covers. The muscle and joint pain was so severe, I couldn&#39;t grip anything including my cell phone (my wrists were in sharp pain). The head pain was so severe I was sensitive to light regardless of how dim it was. I felt like my toes were curled, but that could have been me &#34;bracing&#34; and tightening up due to the total body pain. I could move very little. It was very strange. These symptoms persisted through the night. The following morning at around 9am, I still had a very bad headache that made me nauseated and continued to be sensitive to light. Some of the joint and muscle pain tapered down enough for me to get out of bed to go potty but it was exhausting to walk 5 feet to the bathroom and then get back in bed. I still ran a mild fever. At around 1pm I took a Tylenol that helped subside the symptoms but felt wiped out all day. By the following day (Monday), I was feeling better getting more energy and by that Monday evening, I felt like nothing ever happened. I&#39;m sure these just fall into perhaps the more severe level of the side effects, but I was frightened by the intense sharp muscle and joint pain to the point I couldn&#39;t even grip anything.

                                                As the vaccine was being administered into my left deltoid, the vaccine hurt at the injection site and I immediately felt very strange and felt a rushing sensation to my head and throughout my body, with a concentration in my upper body.  It felt like an out of body experience: I fainted, hitting my head on the adjacent wall and fell to the ground, where the impact caused a bruise to my shoulder and back.  It was reported to me that I lost consciousness for about 10 seconds.  I felt disoriented, but lucid when I came to.  I was not exactly sure what happened, but I could feel that I hit my head on the right side and asked if I fainted since I was disoriented and on the floor.  With assistance, I was able to sit back on the bench, but felt extremely dizzy, light headed, fuzzy/strange type of blurry vision, and intense sweating.  I did not feel well and knew I would have an unsteady gait if I attempted to stand.  After about 15 minutes, I felt well enough to return home.

Over 4 hours and I still can&#39;t breathe properly despite the use of my anti anxiety medicine hours ago. Neck pain. Legs walking in slow motion no matter how hard I tried to push them. Hyperventilating after coughing 2 or 3 separate times. Shooting pain in my back when I lay down. Can&#39;t catch my breath laying down.

                                                Starting around two weeks post-vaccination, I noticed what felt like cold sores / dry mouth around my lips. There were no visible sores, but some redness and maybe a slight swelling. I treated with some OTC items (kanka, peroxdyl) and it subsided a few days later. Then about a week ago, symptoms returned and I had a telehealth visit with my Primary Care doctor on 4/9. She prescribed Acyclovir and recommended Vitamin B12 complex, in addition to using aquaphor to assist with the dry lips. She did not indicate that it was the vaccine, but did not rule it out, so I wanted to report the reaction. While this has helped, it has still not fully improved, and I will be seeing my allergist on 4/19 for a follow up as that was her recommendation if it didn&#39;t go away.

                                                One week after I received it, I noticed I&#39;ve had shortness of breath. It&#39;s not bad, but it&#39;s more difficult for me to breath through my mask, especially when I&#39;m talking. When I&#39;ve been talking for a while, I can&#39;t quite catch my breath. Also, I&#39;ve slightly lost taste. Food tastes a bit &#39;off,&#39; and some items even taste bitter. I had cake the other day, and, to my disappointment, it was bitter (my family said it tasted fine. It was just me). Also, for two and a half weeks from the onset of they symptoms, I had intense flu-like symptoms. I felt achy all over and fatigued, which chills. I found it odd because it started so late and lasted so long. The flu-like symptoms are the only things that have subsided.

That day afternoon she started noticing generalized headache acute onset and was continuously present for following 4 to 5 days.  She had 1 day of headache free symptom.  And she started noticing fluctuating intermittent headaches since that time until today.  She still has headaches ongoing today.  A week ago she also started noticing nausea which is been ongoing and blames mostly for headache.  It is intermittent and denies any vomiting.

She also started noticing dizziness 5 days ago which was more intense and frequent at that time but for the last 2 to 3 days it has become in less frequent.  She walked to the clinic today for the fear of driving and dizziness.  Denies any blurry vision but does have photophobia.

                                                I got the vaccine on 4/7/21 at approx. 10am. Soreness at injection site started about an hour later. At approx. 3pm that day I began to have body aches and chills and had a low grade fever and a very bad and continuous headache. Those symptoms lasted approx. 24-36 hours. By Friday 4/9, I was feeling better and fever was gone. Starting approx. Sun 4/11 I began to have a dull headache wrapping around the back of my head/neck and began having muffled hearing (bilateral, but more prominent in left ear). On 4/15 at approx. 1:15pm I was sitting at my desk and suddenly my heart rate went from resting heart rate to 150. I could feel the pounding in my head and ear and also placing my hand over my heart. I tried to stand up to walk around thinking that might help my heart rate, but I felt faint, so I immediately drove myself to urgent care. My heart rate came down and was back to normal approx. 5-10 min from onset. EKG and CT were done in the ER. I was released approx. 5-6 hours after arrival and told to treat headache with Tylenol or Ibuprofen (which I have not done so far because I normally try not to take medications), and follow up with my primary doctor in a week. Headache and muffled hearing are still present today (4/17), predominately affecting left ear.

Three weeks after my vaccination, my shot site began to hurt and then I started to exhibit an allergic reaction to foods I had never been allergic to previously. First it was ground turkey, and then two days later, I had an allergic reaction (hives, itchy mouth, and anaphylaxis) to chicken. A few days later I developed the same reaction to beef, and now I have the same reaction to berries and vegetables. My body seems to be attacking everything I eat.

                                                The evening I got headaches, chills, muscle, loss of smell and taste. The third day I woke up with swelling like hives and rash around my right eye. I took 10mg of Claritin. The hives spread around the back of my neck and the rest of my body over the course of the morning. Within a few hours it had spread to my chest and my throat felt like it was closing. I had taken Benadryl but it didn&#39;t seem to help. I was also fatigued but had no shortness of breath. I had not eaten anything before the hives started. It had been 48 hours after the shot that I was in the Emergency Room, the hives started around 36 hours. I was given Epinephrine 3mg, Prednisone and Famotidine and given steroids for a few days. I have not had any problems since the first three days after the ER visit.

                                                On Friday I woke up with swelling around both eyes and in my forehead. Swelling increased progressively so that by Sunday my left eye was nearly swollen shut. I saw a nurse practitioner on Monday and she gave me some steroid eye drops. This helped reduce inflammation a little bit but the swelling and redness continues. The skin was stretched, red, thin, itchy, and crusty. It has now been 15 days since my vaccine. The worst of the swelling has subsided but my eyelid and the area under my eye are still puffy, itchy, and red.  I am concerned based on the area of the reaction that this was related to an adverse interaction between the vaccine and dermal fillers I had Injected in February of 2020.   In addition to this reaction I had extreme fever, shakes, lethargy, and random superficial bruising. The bruising appeared in places where I had had no injuries 6-9 days after the vaccine and looked similar to those you see on people who do cupping - not round but like tiny red dots with pooled blood à stippled bruise with no pain.

                                                I started experiencing skin rash in face and flushing about two weeks after the vaccine about three times and had to take a Benadryl each time for the reaction even while being on Zyrtec on a regular basis. I started having under eye puffiness and body rashes right after these reactions that didn&#39;t go away even with regular allergy medication. I then started having a reaction similar to a nut allergy even though I ate something I made at home that had no nuts. I had some swelling on the right side of my face and eye. I also had some minor lip swelling and itching along with throat tightness. I had to take a Benadryl as well with this reaction. I have experienced episodes of this type everyday after eating or just in general and I&#39;m on a high histamine regimen as prescribed by the doctor. I was placed on steroids Prednisone for three days with no results after that. I have episodes where I feel my throat swelled and tightness along with itchy swelled lips, nasal pressure and itchy body.  I&#39;m still taking the his histamines as prescribed and Benadryl when the bad reactions occur. I have a epi pen.

About 2 weeks exactly after the vaccine I got very very sick and went to the  in , ER - I didn&#39;t have a fever but everything hurt on my body and I was nauseous and Had blurred vision. My hearing was off - ringing in my ears.  I was pretty sick after that for about two weeks. I did a follow up with Dr. and he said it sounded typical this J &amp; J vaccine. He said there was nothing he could do. During those two weeks,  I kept taking lots of fluids and ibuprofen as needed. Headaches, body aches c hills, night sweats, blurred vision and I couldn&#39;t sleep - had insomnia. The night sweats were very weird - I never had that before and I could literally ring my clothes out they were so wet every night. I felt like I had a fever but I didn&#39;t the entire time. I felt like I was burning up but I had chills but there was no fever the whole time.   Lately now, I have been feeling a little bit sick for about a week. It&#39;s a little strange because I have a cough and phlegm and very congested in my head.

I fainted at table, then my spouse didn&#39;t know when he came downstairs, he thought my head was just resting at the table. He asked if I wanted to walk to the couch to rest, and as he helped me do so, I fainted and he caught me and carried me to the couch. Recovered within 1 minute but my hearing was  fuzzy for a couple more minutes, sounded like static in my ears.  Other reactions were:  Standard ones I read could happen- Fever of 100.1 that lasted less than a day, chills, aches, warm feeling and fatigue.

Experienced some stinging at injection site within a few seconds that became uncomfortable for several minutes then disappeared.  At 2:40 texted spouse that my face was tingling.  Started in cheeks and upper lip and spread to nose. A few minutes after that I started having hot flashes and my face was flushed.  Hot flashes lasted for an hour and subsided, tingling has mostly subsided except for area of cheek closest to my nose (it is 6 pm now).  Did not formally check into the urgent care facility but did contact them to see if this was normal.  Was advised to take antihistamine and, and if symptoms worsened to go to ER.  Symptoms did not get worse.

                                                Within a couple of minutes of receiving the injection I experienced pain and numbness in my left arm down through my hand. These symptoms are consistent with what I experience during a migraine. Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine the pain expanded to my neck and face on the left side, soon after followed by a mild headache.   Over the course of the day, within a couple of hours of vaccination, my headache remained mild but expanded to a general head pain that wasn?t confined to just one location. Also around this time I began experiencing neck muscle soreness and became very tired.  It is now approximately 10 hours post vaccination and I still have a mild headache. Migraine symptoms still present but not as notable. I feel run down, tired, an overall sense of malaise, and have full body mild muscle soreness.  No medications or treatments used so far to treat these symptoms.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 vaccine was administered to patient and the patient immediately reported pain at injection site, change in taste, and trouble breathing. Patient began gasping for air. The patient remained aware and able to communicate. I instructed a tech to call 911 and the operator instructed me to use a dose of epinephrine. After administration, the patient&#39;s breathing improved. EMT&#39;s arrived and took over care for the patient. I informed them of the time of vaccination and the time of epinephrine administration. The patient was then taken to the hospital to receive additional care.

                                                Received vaccine at 4:10pm on Thursday 4/8/21. 2 hours later, at 6:15pm, I noticed mild tongue swelling which slowly continued to worsen. I pulled out my Epipen but was not having any difficulties breathing and my tongue was only mildly swollen still, so I took Zyrtec at 8pm (which I usually do), and continued to monitor. Zyrtec seemed to slow the progression of tongue swelling slightly but at 10pm, I started having a dry cough and wheezing. I took Albuterol and Benadryl and that worked to stop the tongue swelling. Please note, the reason I don?t use Epi immediately is because I have Reynaud?s and it is contraindicated. So I use other rescue meds first if I can. My O2 sats remained above 95%, so I was not in full anaphylaxis. I did not eat anything or come in contact with anything within those 2 hours that would have caused the allergic reaction, so I am positive it was the vaccine. I also have a red, raised itchy bump at the site.

                                                Normal side affects felt: fever, chills, body aches. Felt by 5pm and lasted until the next morning ~0700. After symptoms broke, the feeling of sluggish occurred all next couple of days. Throughout, it seemed like I could not quench my thirst.  Additionally, red bumpy rash on my legs (mostly thighs) occurred and itching along with it on legs. Not enough to go to emergency room, but definitely uncomfortable. Took Benadryl to help. Subsided about a week later. At injection site, only bruise which I am guessing was from some abnormal bleeding that occurred at injection. I barely had any soreness in the arm.  Lastly, a feeling of inability to take a deep enough breath. A feeling of if I had vicks on my chest type cool feeling when I took a breath. The feeling has lingered until now, but not enough to cause any issue. I can breath, but not full deep breaths. Because it has been getting better every day, I imagine it will subside soon. I will go to doctor if it does not get better.

                                                April 7th about 6:30pm: I became very confused, having trouble remembering where I was or answering simple questions.  Around that same time my vision became blurry, and my face in and around my mouth became numb, I began to slur as a result.  The numbness and slurring increased over the next hour or so.  After that hour or so, I realized I was exhausted and my head hurt so I went to sleep. I also had a strange emotional response to all of this, I behaved giddily and as though it were funny.  April 8th about 8am: I woke up and the confusion, blurry vision, numbness, and slurring were gone.  I had a mild headache, brain fog, and was still more tired than usual.  Later that evening the headache developed in to something more like a migraine, intense pain focused behind my right eye and blurred vision.  At this time I again decided to go to sleep.  It would have been about 8pm.  April 9th about 8am: I woke up still feeling a moderate headache focused on the right side, still tired, and brain fog.  The symptoms weakened throughout the day and by the evening I was feeling mostly normal again.   I have felt healthy and normal since.

                                                * Arm was very sore for about the first 10 minutes.  Moving it reduced it pretty quickly and was no worse than a minor ache for most of the next day or so. * Had a mild headache before the shot (believe due to not having had caffeine that day yet) * At about 6 pm on 4/10, lost appetite due to mild nausea (just enough to not want to eat but not enough to vomit) * At about this time I noticed I also started to feel a little winded, akin to walking just briskly enough that you have to breath harder than if you&#39;re just sitting / resting.  It did not get any worse than this however, so I opted to keep a close eye and see if it eased (which it would by end of Sunday, 4/11) * At about 8:30 pm on 4/10, noticed I felt warm, had a fever between 100.4 to 100.8 * Also around 8:30 pm I noticed that pain I normally feel from my herniated discs and pinched nerves (L4/L5 L5/S1) just ACHED and was more painful than normal. * Started feeling tired (I&#39;m usually up until around 1-2 am, and I was ready to go to bed by 9pm on 4/10)  Also felt a little forgetful / hard to concentrate on anything * When I went to bed, I noticed that my eyes were very sensitive to the white light from my monitor.  This is usually a sign of a painless migraine with auras that essentially blind me for about a half hour.  I did not have auras, though my headache was steadily getting worse to the point I suspect it might have actually been a migraine) * At about 12:30 am on 4/11, the headache got to the point where I could no longer ignore it (best I can describe is it felt like someone was trying to peel my skull of like you would an orange) so I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen.  I also by this point had a fever of 102, though it would drop to 100.5 or so within a few minutes of taking the Ibuprofen. * At about this point the arm starting aching a lot more, I assume because I wasn&#39;t using it while sleeping.  It felt like someone had punched me multiple times hard in the same spot. * I felt much better on the morning of 4/11.  However as the day continued I felt more and more tired.  My temperature was higher than normal but very mild; it stayed around 99.8 for most of the day that I took it.  By Monday, 4/12 I felt mostly fine aside from my arm aching worse than it did when I first got the shot.  Now on 4/14 its pretty much no longer achy.

I woke up at 1am the the next day (4.10.21) with a severe migraine and my heart racing. The migraine was so severe that just bending down made my head pound with extreme pain. I felt very hot and was sweating profusely and my clothes were soaked. I was also very thirsty and drank several glasses of water. I took 4 ibuprofen as it had been 8 hours since my last dose and laid back down in bed and tried to relax. I fell back asleep within 1-2 hours. I felt fine the next morning but did have a slight headache, but it was nothing compared to what I woke up to during the night.

The next morning, I was unable to read on a device (eg phone or laptop) and I was unable to read my books between 1? and about 3? from me. I could read items farther away but not up close. My blurry vision went in and out for several days (until Thursday afternoon) when I went to acupuncture and it was restored by that treatment. My vision has been clear ever since then. I even took 24 hours off of all technology between Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday afternoon and my vision was still blurry Wednesday when I went back to reading from my phone.

I have an IUD in place (placed in December 2017).  The first 24 hours after receiving the vaccine,  I had mild symptoms of headache, low grade fever and aches from the neck up. 2 days after receiving my vaccine, my period began and continued as a light period until April 14, 2021.  I continued with headaches in the temporal region and experienced light headedness and blurred vision throughout the day (still continues as of today 4/19/21). I went to my primary physician on 4/15/21 and was sent for labs (CBC, CMP, and TSH level), an EKG (after hearing an irregular heart rhythm), and a MRI of my brain. All of my labs and MRI were reported as normal. My EKG showed occasional PVC&#39;s.

                                                Around 1am Tuesday, April 6th (the day after the vaccination), developed acute onset fever (Tm 102), chills, extreme muscle aches, profound malaise/fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea.  Those symptoms lasted about 24 hours and, by midday Wednesday, she was back to her baseline of intermittent dry cough, shortness of breath, and no smell or taste.  It wasn&#39;t until Sunday, two days ago, that she developed sharp, pinpoint right superior parietal scalp pain that, after a few doses of OTC Aleve, did somewhat improve.  Other than two 220 mg OTC Aleve tabs twice daily, she has not been taking anything else for her symptoms other than prescribed asthma/allergy meds. She states that her shortness of breath has been helped from the use of albuterol as needed.  Unfortunately, the Aleve has not helped with her chest pain, which she describes as a &#34;constant ache.&#34;  Initially, patient had some pleurisy, but that has apparently cleared up.     No history of CVT, PE, and she does not smoke or take oral contraceptives.

                                                4/10 Vaccination. Within 4 hours I had body aches, fatigue, chills.  4/11 Migraine upon waking up. I took Excedrin. I had been out of my migraine medications. Rested all day. Pattern continued.  4/13 My BP had increased (200/140), racing heart, not well. I went to urgent care. They gave me migraine cocktail. I was having all over global pain and concentrated pain. Lidocaine Q-tips in nostrils as a nerve block to help with pain. The rest of the night I was ok but the next day the migraine was back. The medication was for onset of migraine but it was already there and didn&#39;t work.  4/13-4/18 migraine persisted 4/18 contacted PCM. They told me they needed to see me. I was having high BP due to the increased pain per dr. They did the same migraine treatment that day. The BP medication stayed same as they felt it was a migraine issue. They prescribed oxycodone that day. They couldn&#39;t give Toradol because I had had within 24 hours. I went home, slept and didn&#39;t work for 2 weeks.  4/18,4/21 I went to ER. Repeat of treatments for migraine. Was never fully gone when discharged.  The migraine was always there, the night of the 20th I was throwing up, 21st my eyes were twitching and shaking which was new symptoms to my migraine.  *This has triggered my history of migraines to flare up again since giving birth to my daughter 4 years ago.

As I walked to the restroom to vomit I lost 100% of my vision, I became very disoriented and had the loudest screeching in both ears. I screamed for my husband and I caught me as I was taken to the floor with no mobility. The episode last several minutes before he was able to move me back to bed. I had severe sweating and ear ringing. As I report this I still have a lingering brain fog and ear ringing.  I reported it to my physician and told to go to the ER if any reoccurrence of reaction.

Burning feeling at injection site continued for several hours.  Brain fog and chills set in within 2 hours post injection.  Fatigue, headache, and joint stiffness and pain started about 4 hours post injection.  Injection was given on left arm; left hand became painful about 4 hours post injection, as though someone had put it in a vice.  Joint pain worsened.  Upon laying down to sleep, I became so cold I could not get warm even with an electric blanket on high.  Started to feel stabbing pains in my jaw, back of my neck and down behind my shoulder blade on my left side.  Headache worsened and started to feel pressure in my ears.  Joints, my knees in particular, felt like they were made of gravel and someone was stabbing them with a hot poker.  Did not sleep due to pain.  Has been 20 hours post vaccine, injection site is still very painful and swollen.  Joint pain, headache, fatigue and chills continue.  Was unable to go to work today.

Couldn?t open eyes or move fingers.  Light headed...blacking out when I got up to go the bathroom.  Couldn?t have any sounds (like tv) on.  Just needed to lay still and sleep.    The above lasted 19 hours.    Then my temperature ended.  I had trouble walking and standing for another 20 hours. No stamina.   I went to work near the end of this and noticed I had trouble looking at my paperwork and figuring what to do for my job.  Not sure if this was still the fatigue just in a different way.  Then it disappeared.

The patient stated that immediately after receiving the vaccination, she felt a shooting pain in the injection site. The patient stated that within a few minutes, she felt lightheaded and nauseous. The patient then stated that within 20 minutes, she felt like she was having an asthma attack and had to use her rescue inhaler (albuterol HFA). It was reported that the patient left the pharmacy about 45 minutes after receiving the vaccination and the patient stated she was feeling better. The patient the reported to the pharmacy that the morning of April 7, 2021 that her symptoms of shortness of breath and wheezing returned and she went to an emergency room for treatment. The patient stated that after admission into the ER, the medical staff performed two EKGs and one chest X-ray, which were unremarkable. The patient stated she received treatment with Duoneb because she was wheezing and and treatment with IV methylprednisolone because her throat and tongue appeared swollen. The patient stated she was discharged on April 7, 2021 and was prescribed albuterol solution for nebulization and prednisone 10 mg tablets.

About 20 mins after vaccine I was slightly dizzy and vision a little blurry. I sat down a few more minutes.  About 3 hours later that even is when the chills, body aches, migraine started.   All thru that night I was in pain.  Next day still felt like my head was in a vice with a migraine.  The chills had gone away. still had body aches just not as severe.  Day 3 after vaccine.  SLight headache (nothing  like the vice headache) , arm is still very sore. body aches have subsided considerably.   I treated with taking Tylenol and using a heating pad on my arm and back to help with body aches and pain,.

                                                The shot was administered by a young woman at pharmacy, who I later learned was an intern. She injected the shot less than two fingers down from my shoulder bone, much higher than I have ever had an injection given before.  I immediately felt intense pain, and the intern had trouble pushing the syringe down fully.  She said ?I need help!?, and her male manager ran over, and quickly jabbed the syringe further into my arm, and pressed extremely hard down on the syringe, forcing the remaining contents into my arm. I immediately felt a shooting, searing pain down my entire arm, into my wrist, and  my arm went numb, felt heavy, and tingly by my hand.  The manager pulled the needle out of my arm, and said ?you must have hit bone, the needle is bent?.  I then felt extremely nauseous and woozy, and my vision started going in and out.  I fanned myself and after about five minutes my vision stabilized, and I felt less nauseous.  It is now 9 hours later and I have intense shoulder and neck pain, and limited range of motion of my shoulder.

The cotton mouth, fatigue, headache and fever of 99.9 to 101 lasted until about 8:00am on 4/8/2021., where I had a second set of chills and the fever broke.  On 4/9/2021 I still had fatigue and had to leave work early as I couldn&#39;t multi-task and had a hard time staying focused.  The inability to focus and fatigue lasted 4/10/201 and 4/11/2021, just walking up and down my stairs at home exhausted me.  On 4/12/2021 I went back to work, my focus is better but still not back to where it should be, I still get exhausted easily and everything is a bit too bright.  On 4/12/2021 about 7:30am, I had a bloody nose that took a while to stop (about 30 minutes), that is not normal as I rarely have a bloody nose; I was late to work due to it and had another one while at work around 11:40am; it was not as bad as the first and stopped after approximately 10 minutes.  Today is 4/13/2021- Things are still a little too bright and my energy level is not quite back to normal, I also have a slight headache.

                                                After receiving my vaccine on March 14th, I started experiencing pressure in the left side of my head and severe headache.  As the days progressed, I was continuing to have severe headaches for the next couple of weeks.  I was taking exedrin Migrane medicine to try and calm it down.   When I would try an work out it was worse, it was like the pressure on the left side of my brain was expanding and it would be worse.  My legs and body did feel weak.  It has slowly gone down with less and less of these headaches over the last couple of weeks.  They were definitely different than what a normal migrane feels like and very specific type of feeling.  I don&#39;t know if I have had any clots or not, but I am currently trying to get into a neurologist to get looked at to make sure there is not something else going on.  I am going to try and contact Johnson and Johnson to see if they can help refer to a neurologist because I currently do not have health insurance.

                                                Immediately at 15 minutes: blurry vision; felt off and felt loopy (out of it);  I was dropping food on myself as I was eating. My pupils were really small. I felt out of it. Finally I got home (son drove me). I had mild chest pains and heart racing (had this initially, too). And the chest pains and heart racing kept happening off and on through the night. I had headaches that night and I felt nauseated. Next day, I had to wear sunglasses inside my  house as I was light sensitive and my pupils remained small. I still felt body aches and nausea but the eyes were the biggest concern...shining light by my eyes didn&#39;t make my pupils bigger. The light that came off my phone aggravated my eyes and my head. Thursday, I still had nausea but headache wasn&#39;t bad with Tylenol. Those full two days all I did was sleep. Friday, I felt like things were mild and Tylenol was helping. I called heathline for my eyes. As those still weren&#39;t improving. I got into my eye doctor for an exam (4/9). There was no inflammation and he decided to dilate my eyes. Of course, my eyes were blurry and my eyes responded to that dilation. I napped after returning home. My pupils after the nap were finally responding. I still had a little light sensitivity in my eyes but not as much as I had had and pupils were doing what they should with light. So this was 3 1/2 days later. I still do get mild headache and mild chest pain - it comes and it goes. I have a doctor appt - general check up  - that was already scheduled for tomorrow and he will examine for chest pain.

Saying they were flu-like symptoms is a euphemism. ---Days 2-9 I was weak and shaky on my legs, easily winded (e.g. breathing hard when doing laundry). Fever returned off and on. ---Days 4-13 It felt like someone was sitting on my chest. ---Day 10 I had a blood draw per my doctors request. ---Day 12 Blood draw results showed high d-dimer, and my doctor told me I need to go to the ER for a ct scan to look for blood clots. ---Day 12 Went to Emergency Department - ct scan showed no clots, but elevated Pro B Type Natriuretic Peptide ---Day 15 Finally started feeling better, but still winded easily, fatigued, dizziness, heart palpitations

                                                First I had a funny taste in my mouth - 2-4 hours after vaccine. 8-9 hours after the injection - I woke up with the first of what would become extremely severe body aches. I took some Aleve - that helped some with the symptoms - but not efficacious. It turned into bone deep pain that made me cry. I would say 7 on the pain scale. That lasted two days. It started slow and then it got big. It was very bad for 12-16 hours. I didn&#39;t leave bed and I cried a lot. Worse than childbirth. I was left with another two days after that with some severe fatigue and then I started recovering. About 10 days after vaccine,  on the morning of the 17th, I thought I had a spider bite but it was the beginning of a rather severe shingles outbreak which I haven&#39;t had before.  I had a telehealth appt with employee health -  I was treated  with anti-viral - Valtrex generic on the 19th. The rash was mostly gone with the  medicine - everything is scabbed over but the nerve pain is still here to this day. I still missed work this week.

I also went to the eye doctor but nothing was found.

The next day, I started experiencing migraines and I&#39;ve been having them for about 3 days a week since then. I&#39;ve also been experiencing vertigo for a little over a month, but it has worsened over the last month and has caused me to miss a lot of work. I&#39;ve also been having blurred vision and trouble focusing. I went to the urgent care before I was able to see my doctor, but I&#39;m currently working with her on getting them resolved.

I was unable to work during this time. I did not have a headache afterwards. This had never happened before and I thought it was a retina issue. I saw the eye doctor that day and all tests checked out okay. He diagnosed it as an optical migraine.
