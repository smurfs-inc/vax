                                                Hi, I received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine one week ago, Thurs March 11. On friday, I experienced the typical flu like symptoms - chills aches pains and fever. These have slowly gone away, but a week later I still have chills and constantly shake, and diarrhea. The most significant side effect I want to report is extreme vertigo and dizziness and headaches. These have been present for a week now and have prevented me from working and doing daily activities. I constantly feel like Im going to fall over and cannot see clearly. I previously had vestibular migraines, but these have been mostly gone due to going to the chiropractor and taking my supplements. The vaccine brought them back now in full force. I read that this is becoming a commonality among other people and need answers on this. I want to make sure its not permanent or that I will have this as a serious side effect.

I came out of it within 10 minutes. 16 hours later I had a 102 fever. Took Tylenol Felt fine 24 hours later 32 hours later I started to get a headache and light sensitivity. Fever back to over 99- low grade for me.  35 hours later I had such a bad headache and light sensitivity. I couldn?t watch tv, be on my phone, or look at a computer screen. I also started to get bouts of nausea. 38 hours later, I vomited for the first time. Same symptoms as what I described last. 42 hours later, I vomited again. 48 hours later - 5 days later, light sensitivity and  migraine symptoms continued , but improved slowly each day.               6 days later, all previous symptoms were gone. I woke up with a bump in my inner eye. Slowly went away throughout the day, then developed a itchy, red bump in between my lips and nose, that progressively got bigger throughout the day and made my lip swell. Bump was about 2 inches in diameter at its biggest. Took Claritin, cleaned face with alcohol, and by 24 hours later it was not noticeable.  8 days later, the bump appeared again in between lip and nose on the opposite side of my face.  Took Benadryl, bump slowly went down throughout the day. By 24 hours later it was gone

Inexplicable fear of being paralyzed and dying ( somewhat delirious overnight)- inability to sleep the evening after the shot.  The full day after the vaccination, body temperature rose--couldn&#39;t stop sweating and had a searing headache. Took tylenol to reduce the symptoms.   The following day (today) had severe dry mouth and very sore throat. Felt about 60% back to normal health. I am a very fit 26 year old (run and exercise daily)

                                                Had no side effects whatsoever for many hours. Felt completely fine until about 7:30 pm, while I was making my plate of dinner. Felt lightheaded, dizzy, and hot. I began to black out, so I sat down, which helped for a few moments to subside lightheadedness. I was still feeling hot, so I walked a few feet to my back door and sat down on the steps outside to cool off. Within minutes, my vision blurred completely, I saw stars, and completely blacked out. My mother, who was nearby, heard me fall on the steps. She said my eyes rolled back, my body was completely limp, I was not breathing but rather making gurgling noises from my throat. She propped my head up, which allowed me to breathe properly, and I came to.   If my mother had not been nearby, I am convinced I would be dead right now. I saw the light, saw the other side, saw my relatives. I have had a near death experience once before, and this was exactly like that.

                                                Had typical post vaccine symptoms right after - nausea, muscle aches, chills, fatigue. 5 days after vaccine those appeared to have dissipated. Went for a light walk in the morning. Completely lost vision in both eyes extremely blurry. Stumbled my way home running into trees, cars. Vision came back, thought it was migraine (had them before but nowhere NEAR as bad, never had vision completely blocked)  Excurtating headache behind eyes and nausea, feels like pressure in head. Worst headache of my life, went to ER. Gave morphine (did not help pain at all which was horrifying) got a head CT scan which came out clear and discharged because clotting ruled out. It is now day 6 and my headache is persistent and still excruciatingly painful. I?m also extremely nauseous. I?m terrified because I know something is very wrong. ER doc said might be lingering side effect from vaccine but those effects felt very different.

It feels like a mild headache where moving makes it worse,  or as if I had a hangover but I don&#39;t. I feel tension in my head. Lying down makes me feel better, as does any position where I&#39;m resting my head. Yesterday I also had a weird feeling in my throat that came and went rhythmically.

                                                I noticed a very mild headache and slight coldness within 2 hours of my vaccine.  Onset of my severe symptoms began around 10PM on 03/12/2021 with a stabbing headache (Felt like someone took an air pump and kept &#39;blowing up&#39; my head. My eyes felt achy and heavy and every time I looked in a different direction I would get a zapping/electric feeling throughout my head that would cause my head and neck to spasm (longer duration) or twitch (quick jolt). This also caused dizziness). I got really cold and had intense shivering and shaking. Around midnight, my skin started feeling bruised all over my body (very sensitive to touch, including my bed sheets against my spine felt like rubbing up against a wound). At the same time, my joints (especially my neck, hips, and knees) got hot to the touch and were incredibly painful (induced tears). My muscles developed a deep ache that also caused significant pain. I felt very weak and confused. I didn&#39;t take my temperature until the early morning, and it was 102.9 at that time. I alternated taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen throughout the day, but my temperature stayed between 102 and 103.1 for about 24 hours, as did the previously noted symptoms.   I noticed a gradual improvement of my symptoms over the next two days. On the evening of 03/14/2021, my headache worsened some, and I had an unexpected episode where I nearly passed out (dropped to the floor but stayed conscious). I also had intermittent foot tingling (very noticeable, not mild) over the course of a few hours.   For 3 full days (but by far the most severe within the first 24 hours), I experienced some strange sound processing. Things like the sound of a car driving by or the ceiling fan felt like it echoed throughout my whole body and gave me an uncomfortable shivering feeling.   As of today (03/16/2021), I am mostly recovered. I am still experiencing fatigue, a very mild headache, and some mild pain. My nausea has completely resolved, though that was never a chief complaint of mine.   I realize that some of my symptoms are to be expected with this vaccine. But especially the level of pain I experienced throughout my entire body was very concerning and not something that I was aware could happen as a result of the vaccine.

                                                Was administered covid vaccine J&amp;J  on left arm felt a burning sensation just after it which i knew it normal you just got a vaccine. Walked to the observatory area where we are supposed to wait 15min until you are released to go. Well less than 10 min in the observation area that?s when i started to feel un well my body started sweating excessively and thats when i felt numbness on my right side of my head with a tingling sensation couldn?t hear with my right ear and i freaked out when i started to get blurred vision thats when i knew something was wrong i got up to ask for water once i got up i felt like i was going to faint and felt really dizzy. Once i got to the lady that was there in the observation area  she was shocked at how i looked she told me to go sit down and brought me water as she called the ambulance. Once i was sitting down and was brought water i drank like more than half of the water and the numbness was going down from my right side of my head but still had blurred vision and just felt disoriented and not my self. The ambulance took me to the ER once i got there i felt a little better but still disoriented and dizzy. So disoriented that i left the hospital with me actually realizing i had to stay there to get checked because they kept saying i was fine.

                                                I had sparkles in my vision 5 min. after getting my shot. They went away quickly, so I wasn&#39;t concerned. I had a little bit of hotness up my neck and a little itchy, but both also were quick to go away. I went home and went to bed without issue. I woke up at 4am crying and in a lot of pain all over my body. I had a crushing headache, my back, arms and legs ached down to the bone. I had a fever of 100.7, and had to call in sick from work. I took 3 ibuprofen and it didn&#39;t help stop the pain or fever. I cried myself back to sleep after wreathing in pain for 3 hours. Woke up again crying again and the pain and fever continued on. I drank 2 beers to see if that would help relax my muscles and back around 3pm and by 4pm I finally felt somewhat better, but still couldn&#39;t get up out of bed. I had to call my brother over to help me and considered asking him to take me to the hospital several times because the pain was so intense. The spot where I got my shot wasn&#39;t inflamed, or if it was I didn&#39;t notice. It did seem a little stiff. I managed to fall back asleep and by the time I woke up again the next day around 5am, I felt completely fine. Fever disappeared and the body pain was gone. It was like nothing had ever happened.

                                                On 03/18/2021 at 03:30AM I had a lot of arm pain from my shoulder to my elbow in my left arm. This lasted until 03/31/2021.  On 03/18/2021 I woke up with a headache that would not go away. Next, at about 03:15PM I was not able to walk for about 10 minutes. Then, at about 05:00PM I started menstruating. At 07:00PM I had severe pain in my pelvic area for an hour and a half. At approximately 08:30PM I passed a softball sized blood clot vaginally.  I bled heavily through the night.  On 03/19/2021 I still had a headache and no energy at all. I continued to bleed heavily all day as well. 03/20/2021 was the exact same as the days prior. 03/21/2021 I was still bleeding heavily throughout the day with no energy. I still had the headache as well. I started feeling dizzy while walking on this day.  03/22/2021 I went to work like normal. I was cold all day. I was still bleeding, headache and dizziness. It was hard to stand for 30 minutes. While climbing the stairs I got very light headed and dizzy. I could not go up the stairs at a normal pace. 03/23/2021 I had the same symptoms all day but I was getting short of breath walking short distances. I still had very little energy and a headache. I also lost all color in my face and hands. I was still cold all day. I noticed some slight swelling in my ankles.  03/24/2021 The symptoms were getting more intense. I was still cold.  I finally took some aspirin for the headache because it was very severe. The medication didn&#39;t help with it. This routine went on for the next week and the symptoms intensified with each day. Throughout this time I was still passing clots that ranged in size from golf/ping pong ball to baseballs. They were very painful when they passed.  The days from 03/25/2021 to 04/01/2021 were all the same as far as how I felt.  On 04/02/2021 I woke up with the same symptoms but now I could not stay awake for anything. I slept on and off all day. I only ate one meal a day because I was so tired and I had no appetite. The headache was getting worse as the days went on. The bleeding was still happening. It was not as heavy as the weeks before, but enough to be painful still. I also started having abdominal pain.  On 04/03/2021 I was seeing stars when I moved too quickly. My heart rate was elevated with shortness of breath along with the rest of the previous symptoms. My headache however was very intense.  04/04/2021 I still couldn&#39;t stay awake on top of all the other symptoms. The dizziness and stars were more frequent. I couldn&#39;t move my head without seeing stars.  04/05/2021 I couldn&#39;t get warm and I still felt the same way. I called and made a doctor?s appointment for Wednesday the 7th. I had all the same symptoms still and they were getting worse. I had to move in slow motion so I could try to function.  04/06/2021 I woke up drained of all my energy and color. I couldn&#39;t shower because of the pain in my body. I couldn&#39;t stand because I felt like I was going to fall down. I could barely stand up straight let alone walk very far. I was shaking from being so cold. I had all the same symptoms from the days prior. I was in severe pain. I couldn&#39;t sit because of the pain in my abdomen I couldn&#39;t stand because of the weakness in my legs. I could barely see anything because of the stars I was seeing. At this point I had no color and I was barely conscious. That is when my family took me to the emergency room.

                                                I awoke at 6:45 a.m. feeling a bit sore in my arm, but relatively okay.  I was up for approximately ten minutes and then extended my arms over my head to stretch out some of the achiness and immediately regretted the action.  I began to feel dizzy and nauseous and saw black spots encroaching on my peripheral vision.  I washed my face to relieve some discomfort with no change.  I walked toward the bedroom to grab my glass of water when the black spots increased, clouded my entire vision, and I collapsed on the bed.  I then began to hyper-salivate and after waking my husband and catching my breath, I returned to bathroom, experienced diarrhea, and simultaneously vomited into the trash can.  The vomit tasted chemical and extremely acidic.  My body was also shaking uncontrollably during this time and I kept switching between chills and being too hot.  After I felt comfortable leaving the bathroom, I crawled back in bed but was shaking so much that I couldn&#39;t stop my teeth from chattering and could not get warm no matter that my husband placed an extra blanket over me.  I had taken my temperature before while I was in the bathroom and it read 94.6 degrees Fahrenheit.  I took it again in bed about twenty minutes later and it read 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.  My head was splitting and my arm ached, but I was eventually able to go back to sleep.  I felt better after sleeping for a few hours and drinking more fluids.

                                                Around 4 pm I was starting to feel a little sore. By 4:30 pm I had some major chills that turned into hot flashes. At around 4:30 pm I took 400mg of Ibuprofen. For 1 hour I was fighting a fever and chill spells that rapidly changed during that 1 hour time period, ending at 5:30 pm. Within that time I had major acks in my back and neck. I also experience sinus pressure and pins and needs in my ears and behind my ears. After 5:30 pm I did feel significantly better and now are 8:00 pm I feel exhausted, my head hurts and my ears feel like they weigh a pound each. Hope that was helpful. Thanks for doing what you&#39;re doing.

                                                After receiving the shot, I was required to sit down for 15 minutes. About 5 minutes in, I started to become dizzy, my vision started blacking out, my hearing was muffled, I became clammy, sweaty, and experienced mental disorientation. It became harder for me to breathe, but I never struggled to take a breath. I drank some water and waited for the symptoms to subside. I remained seated and these symptoms went away within 5 minutes. After feeling better for about 5 minutes, I felt cold and was shivering. The woman sitting next to me was completely fine after her shot. I&#39;ve since felt a slight burning sensation on my skin in areas that I have scratched lightly. I&#39;m also experiencing strange feelings throughout my body- specifically my head, leg, and hand. It feels like I can feel something in each area for a bit and then it subsides after several minutes.

After layering up it took about 30 minutes for shaking to fully subside and maybe 2-3 hours for body temperature to feel hot. Had headache and dry mouth the rest of the night into the early morning.   Took 400mg ibuprofen after having a morning meal and experienced no other side effects going forward except some tiredness from not getting a full nights rest.

I started feeling nauseous about an hour later. Then at about 9:00 pm, I started to feel really sick. I felt very tired and my whole body hurt. I had a low body temperature, 95 degrees. Chills, fever, shaking, nausea. Very SEVERE symptoms. Felt very disoriented. I thought I was going to pass out and faint. Vision blurry and seen white.  Pounding headache. Ears ringing. I could hardly walk that night, I was crawling on the floor. I felt out of breath. My heart was beating very fast. My left side of my chest hurt by my ribs. When I did wake up from sleep, I woke up with blood in my mouth and dried blood on my lips.

Headache symptoms included head pressure, ear pain, and generalized full body weakness. Went to urgent care at 6:00pm.  Due to ongoing health issues it was hard for the doctor to tell if it was a reaction to the vaccine or not at the time of exam. The doctor discharged me and recommend I go to ER if symptoms progress/get worse.

                                                Around 3:15 in the afternoon, I began experiencing severe aches and muscle pains, combined with a growing migraine. Not realizing what it may be related to, I took two ibuprofen and I&#39;ve acetaminophen.  By the time I around home around 6:30, I could barely hold myself up. I ate dinner, which only helped minimally, and by 8 pm felt like death. My husband notice I looked red and felt my forehead, immediately going for the thermometer. I had a fever of 100.5.  We eventually got me into bed after downing a lot of water, but the pain would not ease up. The pain was too excruciating. At 10:30 my husband came to bed and we took my temp again which was 101.6. To help me sleep I took another Tylenol. At 5:45 my work alarm went off and I checked my temp again; still 101.6. I got a cold pack for my migraine and went back to sleep. Slowly throughout the day my fever dwindled, until it finally broke in the early afternoon. By 4:15, as I am writing this, all that&#39;s left is done tiredness, thirst, and a small bit of achiness.

I took two pills of extra strength Tylenol and water and laid back down to break the fever and help with the aches and pains. I woke up around 9:30am on 3/13/21 and did not have and appetite all day. I was extremely fatigued all day and had no energy to get out of bed or do much.  On 3/14/21 I began to develop an appetite again around noon. I was still fatigued. My arm was very tender and itchy at the injection site and hurt to the touch. My 5:00pm on 3/14/21 I had more energy and the aches were gone but my arm was still hurting and sore.

The day after I recieved the covid vaccine Janssen, I started noticing the injection site getting red and swollen. By the next day it had grown in size and was itching rather badly. I could sleep from how badly it was itching and burning. It has been 6 days since I got the vaccine and it&#39;s still large and swollen and really itchy. I have been taking ibuprofen for the pain and using benadryl for the itching.

She drank some water and sat down for a little bit and started to feel better.

                                                Headache (turned into a migraine), extremely drained of energy, lack of appetite, and felt off all day (4/9/21). The next morning (4/10/21) felt the same as the day before, however, had several episodes where I would get really light headed, dizzy, and nauseous. Went to Home Depot at 2:15pm (4/10) and while there my vision blurred and started to fade, I had ringing in my ears and couldn?t hear out of the right and barely was able to hear out of the left. I got very nauseous and I couldn?t breath. I managed to sit on something and put my head between my legs that helped. Fortunately my step- dad was with me and helped me outside while I could barely see and hear and he stated I was very pale. I was having a hard time talking or being conherent. Once outside the symptoms slowly cleared over about the next 6-7 hours. At 4:45pm my mom decided to take me to the doctor but the walk in had just closed and I went to the ER. They stated I had elevated d-dime and did a chest CT scan  to check for blood clots around 7:30pm (I believe not sure exact time) doctor stated they came back clear but when asked if he suspected that the episode and symptoms were due to a dissipated blood clot he would not directly answer it. I overheard him dictating his notes and he started he beloved as such. I have never experienced anything like this before. I still felt drained, headache (migraine), occasionally dizzy, and lack of appetite (4/11/21, 4/12/21) and still currently feel the same drained, migraine, lack of appetite, and occasionally dizzy.

                                                It started slowly with feeling extra tired and light arm soreness. Then rapidly became extreme shivering, a fever, headache and full body muscle aches. In the early morning I also got stomachache cramps and felt hungry, but food didn?t help. It actually made me feel nauseous. By 6am the next day I had a serious migraine too - sensitivity to light. My eyes hurt. It actually was so bad I caved and took 2 liquid Advil?s to help with the pain. From there I slowly got better over the day but still had the above mentioned symptoms, just less intense. Around 8pm the fever came back and I called it a night.  Next morning I felt better, but still tired. Still had a headache but not a migraine. And occasional stomach aches. It?s now 2 days later and the head aches, arm soreness and occasional stomach aches have not gone away.

                                                Got my vaccine on Monday in my right arm. On Thursday morning I had blurry spots in my eyes that lasted a couple of hours. It almost felt like i had something in my eyes. I kept rubbing and checking them. I called my primary care doctor and the office told me he would call me back. An hour later the blurs went away but the right side of my face down my neck had a numbing sensation. My right ear also felt like it need to be ?popped? like when on a plane that wouldn?t go away. Wasn?t completely numb but felt numb. When my doctor called me back i told him my symptoms and he told me to go to the emergency room. They ran blood work and did a CT and saw nothing abnormal beside my iron was a little low but I?m pregnant so that wasn?t surprising. I left not really knowing why I?m feeling this in my face. It still has that numbing feeling. And Friday i had a 10 minute nose bleed on my right side where I?m feeling the numbness.

                                                My first side effects were fatigue and feeling ?out of it?, which started about 2 hours after the injection. At 7 hours after my left leg became numb and a little sore. I started to notice a feverish, tingly feeling on my skin and this would last at least 24 hours. These symptoms quickly spread through my whole lower body. The chills and intense body aches started at 11 pm. I woke up at 2 am that night and had a low grade fever 99.9 F. I took 2 pills of Tylenol. The fever broke around 3:30 or 4 am and I slept through the rest of the night. The next morning 3/09, I felt fatigue, slow, and woozy. I still had chills and muscle aches, although the intensity was less. Halfway through the day the chills intensified, the muscle aches became more severe, and my eyeballs felt like they were burning in the back of my head. By that evening, the fever was back and I couldn?t think straight. My legs ached with a pain that I?ve never felt before. I did not have a severe headache, but I felt that if I exerted myself too much I would get one. My partner said I could barely form coherent sentences, and I was so weak I couldn?t sit up straight. I took 2 more Tylenol that night, went to bed and slept through the whole night. The morning of 3/10 I woke up feeling tired but my skin did not have that feverish feeling. I was no longer sick. On 3/11 I woke up and did my normal morning routine. I ate an egg, some of a Nutella stuffed scone, and drank coffee and water. I took my 3 pills, loratadine, omeprazole, and a probiotic, and I had a severe allergic reaction within 5 minutes of taking the pills. For the next 10 minutes my breathing became labored and wheezy. I experienced severe eosinophilic esophagitis symptoms. For the next week, my EoE symptoms were heightened. I had a reaction after drinking a seltzer water, which does not usually affect me. Within 2 weeks I was back to normal and to my knowledge have not experienced any other related side effects.

                                                12 hours after injection I was shivering freezing using multiple blankets. When I tried to walk I was very dizzy with blurred vision. I had body aches and a severe headache. My temperature was 104.7 with the thermometer. My breathing was as if I worked out but was just sleeping. I called an ambulance and was taken to health center where doctor took over care.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I began to feel nauseous, almost like being car sick while looking at my phone. I also began to feel tightness in my chest. After my 15 minutes were up I asked the administrator of my shot if it was normal that I felt dizzy/chest tightness. They said it was probably fine and just to monitor my  symptoms. I went and sat in my car a few min and I began to feel very strange, it seemed very bright out, I felt weak, and my eyes felt very heavy. I wanted to get home so I started driving but on the highway, my heart beat was very fast and I began to feel like I couldn&#39;t swallow. At one point felt as though I might be about to choke so I pulled over because I thought I was going to have to dial 911 as my throat was feeling like it was closing up. I tried swallowing a few times with great effort and after a few minutes the sensation started to lessen. My throat hadn&#39;t closed up completely, however it did feel like it had swelled up.

I came back into it pretty quickly after passing out. I was super sweaty after shot.

                                                Shortly after I received the Janssen Covid Vaccine I begin to lose some of my taste and smell. There is a specific metallic smell that I smell in certain foods and items such as coffee, perfume, my deodorant, and even my bowel movements. I have difficulty smelling onions &amp; garlic but can still taste them.  I had Covid back in January 2021 where I lost my taste and smell. I regained it and only AFTER receiving the vaccine did I have problems with smell/taste again.

                                                I am currently pregnant. This is my first pregnancy.  My due date is August 29, 2021.  My pregnancy has thus far been really easy with no complications.  I had a low grade fever that I took Tylenol to treat.  I had pretty bad muscle and joint pain, chills, and could not stop shaking.  I just felt freezing.  Once my fever broke I felt extremely hot all night.  The next morning I was exhausted and had a lot of the muscle and joint pain still.  I marked on my report that it would&#39;ve stopped me from going about my normal daily activities, as I could not have gone to work and spent most of the day resting.  For the next few days I was tired and my eyes ached.  On Monday and Tuesday I had a headache in the afternoon.  Yesterday afternoon my eyes finally stopped aching and everything seems to be back to normal.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At 7:00am on 3/11/2021 felt light headed as  waking up along obvious soreness on the arm where I received the vaccine- left arm.  Then later around 10:00am a feeling of tiredness came over my whole body.  Around 12:00pm I felt even more tired, lightheaded  and my eyeballs felt as if with high pressure in them and are feel sensitive to the sunlight.  Also, at 12pm, I had lunch, which was my first meal of this day and felt the necessity to lay in bed and take a nap for 20 minutes before returning to work.  While taking the nap I felt tingling on my feet, arms, hands and neck along with certain sudden muscle contractions on the same parts.

                                                After being administered the vaccine at 7:12 am, when the nurse stood me up and started to walk me to the holding area, I became dizzy, my legs got weak, and there was a loud ringing in my ears. I nearly collapsed as I reached the seat in the holding area they were taking me to. I placed one 0.5MG tablet of my prescription Alprazolam in my mouth and waited for the nurse to bring water. They took me via wheelchair from the holding area to a secluded spot behind a curtain. There, I laid on a cot, received cold water, and a nurse talked to me while I recovered. It felt like I was having an anxiety attack, which has never happened to me after getting a shot before. Fitbit heart rate data shows my heart rate at 105 BPM at 7:00 am (going through the admission process, walking around the facility), 83 BPM at 7:10 am, 79 BPM at 7:15 am, 74 BPM at 7:20 am. Between 8:15 am and 1:25 pm, my heart rate remained between 63 and 89 BPM. My arm was sore and my skin hurt (an issue that I have when I feel very stressed). Additional symptoms arose around 1:35 pm. I began going through cycles of chills, sweating and overheating. My heart rate ranged from 127 BPM and 93 BPM for the remainder of the night. I took Tylenol at 7:07 PM to help with my fever.

I wasn&#39;t able to get up and my arm swelled up really bad.  I was having streak in my vison and really bad dey eyes and mouth.  I had a fever on going for about 3 weeks straight. I called my Doctor the following day and she said it was a normal reaction, if it get&#39;s worse to call her again. I called her again because it got worse, my neck got swollen. left arm was trembling, lymph nodes were swollen, leg leg was pulsating. I started having chills and hot flashes ( I still have some till this day). My Doctor recommended seeing a specialist- Neurologist, Infectious Disease Dr.  The Neurologist said he can see where I get the trembles but does not  want to put me on medication and see if it goes away on it&#39;s own. I have a follow up with him regarding trembles, headache, flashing in my eyes. The Infectious Disease Dr. I&#39;m following up her her again regarding my arm swelling, they prescribed me steroids but had not gone down.  Since all of this I have been very fatigue, this is everyday.

By 11 PM was running a 101.8 F fever.  Took some over the counter cold medicine to reduce the fever.  By 7:20 am on 4/8/21 temp was 98.9 F, but having trouble concentrating/ focusing and feel fatigued just getting up and moving to another location.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the vaccine, while I was in the 15 minute observation period, I began to feel hot and cold at the same time, began sweating heavily, my limbs started becoming very weak and I started seeing spots. I called over a doctor and explained what was happening. He got a wheelchair and brought me to a room to lie down. During this time, my vision continued to get worse (seeing more spots and less peripheral vision).  Upon laying down, the doctor put my feet up and a nurse took my blood pressure. If I remember correctly, it was 90/58. My normal blood pressure is around 112/68. A nurse also put ice under my neck. Immediately upon laying down, I started feeling better. I was observed for a while more and then a nurse took my blood pressure again (both laying down and sitting up). My limbs still felt weak when seated and my blood pressure was better but not normal yet, so I was told to lay down a bit longer. Then, a nurse checked my blood pressure again (laying down, sitting up and standing up). It was back to normal and I was feeling better. I was cleared to leave the vaccine clinic. Since leaving the clinic, I haven&#39;t had any abnormal side effects or reactions.

                                                About 5 hours after receiving the vaccine, I was overcome with uncontrollable muscle spasms / body shakes. After about 5 minutes they subsided, but the same thing happened a few hours later and were so overwhelming I had to crawl on the floor to move. I felt achey and exhausted, with heavy night sweating. The next day, symptoms included  light sensitivity, headache, chills, sweats, body aches, fatigue and a 101 degree fever. My symptoms subsided by the next day, about 36 hours after the initial injection.

                                                I?ve never had an allergic reaction to anything before.  Received the vaccine at around 9:55am on 03/08/21.  Pain while the vaccine was being administered but it healed within a few minutes. I started getting a mild headache at around 3:30pm while at work. When I got home at around 6pm I started having severe chills, the headache became intense, my mouth and eyelids felt hot, my hands and feet felt very cold and when I checked temperature it was 102.4.  By 9:00 pm the headache became excruciating like I?ve never had it before, as if my head was being squeezed or pressed. Eyes and the back of my jaw hurt too.  Had light and sound sensitivity. Took 200mg of Advil but pain was still almost intolerable until I was finally able to fall asleep at around 4:00 am.  Was still in pain the day after but not as bad as the night before. Only mild pain today but started feeling itchy tonight and noticed some rashes on my body.

I started to develop a low grade fever 8 hours after the shot. 13 hours after the shot, I had a 104.1 fever. Along with the fever, I experienced severe body aches and chills, nausea and a horrible headache. I couldn?t walk as my body was so weak and my vision was blurry. About 15 hours after the vaccine, my fever went down to 102. I was able to get up and walk to my kitchen to take some Advil. My fever broke 20 hours after the vaccine with the medicine. I?m still experiencing severe body aches, headache, nausea and chills and it has been about 30 hours after vaccine. I did have covid 3 months ago, and the symptoms from the vaccine were much worse than the symptoms I had with actual covid.

                                                3/6/21  This is a 32-year-old female who is receiving her first Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine and shortly afterwards developed some throat itching and tightness.  She was given a milligram of epinephrine by intramuscular injection by retired emergency physician there and then transported by ambulance here for further evaluation.  Says her tongue felt a little swollen as well but she denies any respiratory symptoms.  Her voice sounds crackly to her.  She denies any pruritus or rashes.  She has had multiple allergic reactions to medications in the past but never having to be admitted overnight.  One episode however did occur while she was hospitalized and receiving treatment.  She has never had to be intubated.  She has had isolated urticaria without oral or throat symptoms and vice versa.  At this point she says she does feel somewhat better. She is given IV dexamethasone and observed here.  At 1 point she complained of it complaint complained of it feeling like a tightening in the back of her throat was worsening.  She is given an additional intramuscular dose of epinephrine with epinephrine and on reexamination had no significant change in physical findings or her phonation.  This occurred again and she was given viscous lidocaine with minimal improvement in her symptoms.  After several hours of observation without objective worsening but continued complaint of feeling increasing tightness in her throat, CT imaging of the neck is performed to assess the soft tissue structures.  No abnormalities or indication of significant retropharyngeal or paralaryngeal edema or airway compromise present. Given the possibility of some laryngeal muscle or parapharyngeal muscle spasm as him, she was given Flexeril.  After some discussion with her I did indicate to her that I felt it would be safe to return home but offered admission for observation as well.  She indicated she was comfortable returning home for continued observation.  She will be continued on steroids and antihistamines and is given additional Flexeril by prescription if this does seem to help her symptoms.  If no improvement over the next 2 to 3 days and follow-up either with her primary providers through facility or Dr.  3/7/21: Return to ED. The patient is in no respiratory distress.  She has no wheezing.  On physical exam her throat lips and tongue look fine.  I think she is not a had another allergic reaction, rebounded from yesterday.  She is not on any type of steroids sinus syndrome with some Decadron.  And she is allergic to Benadryl but she can take Claritin if she wants.  Her CBC and chemistry were normal.  I went back to evaluate her and she still getting fluids and now she is complaining of shooting pain down her left leg from the EpiPen.  Again she has this regional complex pain syndrome that could be part of that but there is nothing I can do for this at this time.  In terms of her allergic reaction she feels much better her throat feels normal.  We will send her out with prescription for Decadron and EpiPen and if she gets worse she will come back and will follow up admit her.

The biggest symptoms I had were severe body aches, debilitating chills, fluctuating fever, headache, and no appetite.  4/1/21: * 11:15am: Vaccine administered * 12pm-6pm: Arm soreness, feeling cold/experiencing some chills, minor headache and stomach ache (I felt a little off but couldn?t tell if it was real or in my head) * 5:30pm: I walk home from work, which takes about about 35 minutes. Regret the decision about 10 mins from home due to onset body aches and fatigue  * 6pm: I go straight to bed freezing with crippling chills, body aches, and a headache * 8pm: Extreme nausea kicks in, I take Advil and cannot stomach more than one bite of food; still experiencing chills and body pain * 9pm: 100.7 fever, the chills subside and I start to get hot * 10:15pm: I finally eat some food, drink more water, body still aches, start to get chilly again  * 10:45pm: My fever is down to 99.3, my ears really hurt, like, ear-infection-style pain  * 11:15pm: 12ish hours post-vaccine, I have severe body aches, I alternate between really hot and cold, take more Advil and go to bed (finally fall asleep at midnight)  4/2/21: * 6:15am: Wake up; I spent the night tossing and turning with extreme night sweats. At this point I still have a pretty bad headache and painful body aches, specifically in my lower back and legs; fall back asleep * 8am-9am: Wake up and take more Advil. My whole body hurts. Toss and turn for a bit more. Small fever?99 degree temperature. Make coffee but have absolutely no appetite. * 9am-10am: So sweaty, fever is fully breaking * 11am: No more fever, slight headache, and body aches seem to be subsiding * 11:45am: Almost exactly 24 hours later and feeling good, comparatively speaking. Finally eat a bagel * 5:30pm: After lunch, I took a nap. My body aches have completely subsided, no fever. I still have a small headache and my ears still ache. But overall, I feel pretty normal! Just a little tired but probably from lack of sleep last night.

                                                On the morning following my vaccination around 8:30am, I woke up to my tongue and mouth swollen with difficulty swallowing.  Due to this my body broke out in red splotchy hives around my hands and legs.  I immediately injected myself with a Epi pen and after a few hours all of these symptoms went away.

I got the typical muscle aches, chills, etc. In fact I got every side effect listed plus more. I want to discuss the other side effects. On day 3 I started to develop extreme chest pain and pressure. It is a dull pain as if someone if sitting on my chest that will not go away. I also started to experience sudden bouts of dizziness and vertigo. It will not go away. Today is Day 7 and I spent the night in the emergency room because my chest pains got so strong. However, all the work up came back okay. I also have this strange feeling of electrical shocks running thru my head, those last about .5 seconds and go away, but it is a very weird feeling I have never experienced. I also have a strange desire to constantly burp, when I do my chest pain feels better. If I don&#39;t burp my ears start to feel full and sometimes they ring. Its Day 7 and I still feel SO miserable. Why id no one speaking about these chest pains? I know 5 people who have experienced the same.

I had a slight droop on the l eft side of my face, mostly noticeable around the corner of my mouth. I also experienced itchiness around the injection site. The symptoms started with numbness in the tip of my tongue about 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine and slowly spread to the rest of my face. Approximately 5 hours after receiving the vaccine the entire left side of my face was numb. I called a nurse hotline to find out if I should seek medical care that night or wait until morning. They urged me to go to the ER.   I went to the ER, underwent a plethora of tests, received positive results on all of them, and was sent home with instructions to return if my condition worsened. The doctors said I had Bell?s Palsy but had little insight as to why it had occurred.  a nurse hotline

On 4/16, woke up with almost no ability to hear out of my left ear and there was a very loud ringing sound in my ear. Happened off and on throughout the day but by evening, I only heard a ringing noise. I went to the urgent care and they said my ear had no sign of ear infection or allergies.   Next morning, I couldn?t hear almost anything out of my ear with a very loud ringing noise. Was consistent through 4:30pm that day.  Went back to the urgent care and a different nurse practicing confirmed my ear looked completely normal.  I?ve never experienced deafness or ringing in my ear before.    Since this morning (4/18) I have had a low ringing sound in my left ear, but no more deafness.

                                                Yesterday I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I was the last appointment, so they observed me for 5 minutes, and I left. After riding in the car for a few minutes, I noticed that I was having a hard time breathing and my throat felt like it was starting to swell. By that time, the clinic was closed, so I went to the emergency room just in case and sat in my car since they didn&#39;t allow people to sit in the waiting room because if covid.  It started becoming increasingly difficult to breathe, and I was feeling more and more swelling of my throat and tongue. I was having a lot of dizziness, nausea, facial flushing, palpitations, and some mild confusion. I then started getting numbness in the bottom half of my face. Over time, the numbness spread, mostly staying on the left side of my body (face, scalp, lower arms and legs, left side on tongue and inside of mouth). I also started getting a prickling burning pain sensation for brief periods of time where I had numbness. I had decided that if my breathing worsened at all, I would go to the er even though I can&#39;t afford it.   After about an hour and a half, my breathing started to feel less constricted and like there was less resistance. The swelling in my throat was mostly in the upper throat where I had difficulty swallowing but not as much difficulty breathing. The numbness continued to get worse and was sometimes disappearing and reappearing in the same spot.  At 9:30 pm we went to go get some benadryl. I continued feeling less and less swelling and having an easier time breathing. At that point, I went home. Once I was home, my breathing continued to improve and the numbness started to dissipate.  In the middle of the night, I started itching and getting widespread hives and getting a sharp burning pricking pain that would last a few seconds in different areas. The numbness also started coming back mostly in my face. I continued to have difficulty swallowing.  I am feeling much better today. I still feel some slight swelling in my throat when I swallow, but my breathing is fine. I&#39;m still itchy and occasionally breaking out in hives. Im having mild lower facial numbness. I&#39;m also starting to get the normal side effects of fever, headache, arm soreness, and body aches. I&#39;m taking benadryl every 4 hours.

                                                About a minute after I had the injection, my arm started hurting and it felt like hot water was coursing through my veins. I got an immediate headache that progressed into light headedness, my vision got blurry and I saw colors and then I started to lose my hearing, it felt like there was cotton in my ears. The nurses said I went pale and they called it a panic attack, but it was unlike any panic attack I have ever had in my life. I?ve had my TDAP updated a few years ago and got a flu shot and did not feel anything like this. I was rolled out of the room on a wheel chair because I was too dizzy to walk and then threw up several times into a bag and peed myself. It took about 20 minutes before I felt normal again.   The following day my arm felt numb and incredibly sore, I couldn?t raise it that far up without excruciating pain. I felt weak, fatigued and dizzy and was unable to use the bathroom. I had fever sweats and chills on and off. I was not able to sleep well, but I think that?s because of the pain in my arm.

I have had a horrible nagging cough since having this shot. I got the shot on 3/14/21 ... it is now 1 month later and I still have it. I can be talking fine and then all of a sudden cough. I cough all day and all night. I never should have gotten this vaccine.  My cough will not go away. I am in the healthcare field which is why I got this injection and now I regret it. I also tested POSITIVE to COVID 1 week after getting the shot. I lost all sense of taste and smell and felt horrible. I got tested for COVID on 3/21 and found positive.

                                                Started with chills pretty shortly after the vaccine was injected.  After about 6 hours I could tell I was not feeling great.  My husband said I looked very pale and out of it all of the sudden.  I became extremely tired and disoriented.  I don?t remember driving myself home that evening after picking up my kids from dance.  By the time I was home it was now around 8 pm.  I was so cold my entire body was trembling.  I kept taking steaming hot showers but I couldn?t feel it, I was still freezing and shaking.  I was very weak and started having extremely horrible body aches and pains.  Specifically my legs were hurting the worst, I remember my hip joints felt like they?d buckle underneath me.  I got a headache that was unbearable.  It felt worse than a migraine.  It hurt to move my head or use my eyes at all.  I went to bed and was under several blankets and a heating pad while also running a space heater right next to me.  I still could not get warm at all.  I hallucinated that I could see each ache and pain on my body and watched them move through me.  By 4 am I was now hysterical and crying.  I was in so much unbearable pain and so scared.  I had to call off of work for this day.  I was so out of it I called my daughter off of school but also called for my mom to come get her and take her to school.  I kept my youngest home with me.  My head was still the absolute worst headache I have ever felt in my life.  I couldn?t open my eyes and it hurt to move at all.  I had to call a friend to come pick up my youngest daughter because I was unable to take care of her, I could barely stay awake and alert.  I tried another hot shower and everything still felt cold.  I was now nauseous from the head pain.  Around noon on this day I finally had the strength to drink some water and was able to take Tylenol.  I laid on the couch for hours still shivering and in unbearable pain.  I was still very scared that I was having such a bad reaction that I would die.  I called my husband to come home from work and be with me because I was scared.  I took more Tylenol a couple hours after the first dose.  Around 6 pm I started to feel better.  I was able to eat again that evening.  I had a headache though for about 3 weeks after that gradually weaned away.

Vision slightly obscured, but I could still see. Applied a cold compress throughout the day and monitored for additional concerns. By the end of the day, the swelling subsided. By Monday, both eyes still felt pressure pain, but the swelling was significantly improved. Other side effects included the expected muscle soreness/aches, fatigue, and a mild rash around the vaccination spot. No additional adverse effects observed.

On Saturday (4/17/2021), the patient had &#34;the worst headache I have ever had&#34; along with severe inner left ear pain. Patient took an ibuprofen which helped with the pain for about an hour then the pain came back. Pain got worse 2 hours later when she drove home from work. She called the RN line and was told to take ibuprofen and follow up in the AM. The next day 4/18/2021, patient went to urgent care and received Toradol and was told it was a migraine. Today 4/20/21, patient still had pain and noted feeling left sided facial numbness and blurry vision that correlated with when she got the headache. Patient went to an urgent care today and CT scan revealed a blood clot. She was then sent to the ED for evaluation. In the ED, she has no headache and facial numbness and has minimal left ear pain. Her headache is localized to the left side of her head. Patient denies fever, chills, and COVID symptoms. Patient was started on argatroban drip per hematology recommendation.

                                                I first had chills and a low-grade fever with a migraine. That was around 5 PM that night. At around 9:00 PM I had chills, migraine, bodyaches, burning sensation in my joints, neck pain, and a low-grade fever. I took some Tylenol at around 7 PM. But the pain did not subside and I was able to use the bathroom the next day at around 4 AM and was still in severe pain. That day at around 1 PM I was able to set up and felt 30% better. On day two I am feeling better but I still have minor body aches I do get fatigue while doing light work around the house and no appetite and loss of taste is the newest symptom. I am not 100 percent better but close to it.

                                                I had some sort of reaction to the vaccine about 1-2 minutes after receiving it, and it was super scary and they had to call the paramedics.   After the pharmacist injected me, I felt the arm pain right away. No big deal. I walked over to the chair to sit for my 15 minutes. I was happy to be vaccinated and kind of saw it as my mini booster for my immune system that already beat COVID-19. As I sat there, the only thing I could say is, I felt a tingling cold sensation moving from my arm through me. Almost like I could feel the vaccine moving through my system. The tingling kept moving and I thought to myself, okay cool. I guess it&#39;s working. Awesome. But then my head felt cold, I felt tingling in my head, my mouth tasted like metal, saliva started to build in my mouth, I started to sweat, I felt overly sweaty all over my body, but my head felt cold and tingly.   I was staring straight ahead and everything started to go staticky, like a television set, and the static began to build and started to get starry. Everything in my vision started to fade. So I spoke out to say something weird was happening.  A man came over to talk to me and hold me up. He kept saying stuff but then my ears started ringing and I couldn&#39;t hear him anymore. I began to fade out as the stars got more intense. Then, as if it was just a mini reboot, my brain started to come back online and the picture in front of me began to fade back into view. I felt nauseous and still had a super metal taste in my mouth. They called the paramedics to give me a checkup. The metal taste in my mouth stayed the longest, but after about 45 minutes I felt well enough to go home.  On and off, I have this intense tingling inside my brain. It reminds me of a time when I was in the hospital on morphine. Just a tingling pins and needles sensation inside my head. Other than that, I am okay now. But I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s some sort of reaction because I already had COVID-19.

I couldn?t walk 3 feet without having to sit with my head between my knees. I passed out in a 5 foot walk but luckily i sat down on my couch as it was happening. I?m not diabetic, haven?t ever been hypoglycemic. Ibuprofen and food after about 2 or 3 hours is a must.

There was also nausea and headaches on and of the whole day. Went back to work the following day but felt heavily nauseous for most of the day and couldn&#39;t eat or drink much of the day.

                                                I received the vaccination 4/2/21 at 11am and at about 6pm the same day - I felt a sudden flush and felt like I was going to faint in the middle of Grocery store. Got very clammy and sweaty and weak - immediately left the store and started projectile vomiting outside the store and all night the first night. Had extremely joint/bone pain throughout my entire body for 4 days straight in bed, very weak, chills and night sweats, day 2 I had a little energy and drove about an hour and immediately started vomiting again  for day 2-day 5. Day 5 I woke up with swollen eye lids and hands and thought it was an allergic reaction to something in my house so took benedryl, but didn?t help. The swelling went down on day 6. I?ve had no energy and very foggy brain and been very down. My chest has felt like an anxiety attack 24/7 all week. I am on day 10 since the vaccination and my chest pain has increased. I still have foggy brain and been very out of it and weak still. I vomited day 1-day 5. Really bad pain in my hips and arm where I received the shot.

                                                I received the vaccine at noon on Saturday. 12 hours later I experienced severe chills and body aches which lasted 12 hours. Late afternoon on Monday I began experience sharp pains on the left side of my head, in my left inner ear, my left temple, behind my eye and above my eye to the upper part of my left forehead. At one point in the evening, it hurt to move my eye . These pains have persisted. I took 800mg of Ibuprofen on Tuesday morning, which took away the sharp pain but there is still a dull pain/feeling of pressure behind and around my left eye and ear. The eye feels dry and sore when I blink. I called a doctor and they felt it could be a migraine. As someone who suffered from migraines in the past, it doesn&#39;t feel like one.

She reported muscle weakness and general fatigue, an inability to focus and described feeling like she was &#34;drunk.&#34;  She began to have vision changes that affected just her right eye on 4/12/21 at 2:00 PM. She described it as blurriness and like looking through a kaleidoscope. The vision disturbances resolved 2 hours later after resting, but the headache remained. The only symptom that remains is the headache and it is improving and described as mild.

The reaction did not worsen. From a 1 to 10, ten being bad, the reaction was a 3. I had no difficulties breathing. The numbness went away after about 30 minutes.   The following day: chills, light fever 100.2F, stomach pain, loose stool, and fatigue.

                                                About 12 hours after the shot I experienced chills, fever and headache lasting about 36 hours.  Since then I have had incredible headaches almost daily, lasting a few hours (I have been taking Tylenol for the headaches).  Usually headaches are after 5pm, I will feel dizzy, foggy, and intense pressure, some blurred vision. I do not have a history of migraines or headaches, I have been taking the Tylenol, drinking lots of water, and taking baths to try and help with them.

After 12 hours, nausea and headache set in. 13-14 hours, a terrible stomachache and diarrhea. My skin felt so sensitive that it hurt to touch. Zofran treated the nausea. The day after the injection I was exhausted, was nauseous and had a headache. 48 hours after injection I woke up with a strange headache. I could look to the right pain free, but if I looked to the left or left/up, I had a piercing pain near my right eye. Excedrin/Tylenol did not relieve this headache. On Hour 72, the headache is still present, though to a lesser degree.

                                                Was eating dinner (seasoned smoked chicken, broccoli, cauliflower, fries) and soon after, felt my lips starting to swell. I had seasonal allergies occurring that day, so I kept eating a bit longer. My tongue then started tingling. I took a dose of Children&#39;s Benadryl (all I had for Benadryl at the time). I then waited about 10 minutes before I felt my throat starting to close. We headed straight to emergency room (5 mins away). By the time I got there, I started to have a little trouble taking breaths. When I got into the trauma room moments later, I became nauseous and dry heaving.  They gave me an epinephrine shot, Benadryl, Pepto, and Prednisone.   They watched me for a few hours before release. Upon discharge, they provided me a prescription for epi-pens, famotidine, prednisone, and fexofenadine (5-day prescriptions).

                                                I took the Johnson and Johnson vaccine on March 6th. The following day my left arm was sore and my right ear was hurting. On March 10th I went to my doctor office because my right ear pain would not go away. The NP diagnosed me with having trigeminal neuralgia. She subscribed me some nerve pill to take two times a day. On March 17th I went to my dentist complaining that my lower right side of my teeth was hurting me. He took x rays and didn?t see anything, but did an unnecessary filings on my top right side of my teeth which cost me $149. I got in my car and called the NP complaining that my teeth was hurting me. She said it?s because of that trigeminal nerve that goes from the ear to the mouth which is causing the trigeminal neuralgia. She said it?s okay to take one nerve pill in the morning and two at night. That Saturday, March 20th I couldn?t sleep and was in excruciating pain. I went to the ER to see if they could give me any relief. The ER doctor did a CT and which confirm I do have trigeminal neuralgia. He referred me to a neurosurgeon. I finally got an appointment with the neurosurgeon on Friday, April 16th. On April 3rd I was in so much pain again. I called my doctor office and she up the nerve pill that I can take up to 4 times a day if needed. So now I take 4 nerve pills a day along with ibuprofen and extra strength pain reliever pill.

The last one (no taste/smell), is the most unusual, I&#39;v never had this before.

I refused further medical care because I felt better once the ambulance arrived. I visited my primary care doctor on 4/13/2021 to follow up.  He said it was likely an occular migraine.  A blood test was ordered and results came back as essentially normal.  I have been continuing to have dizzy spells, headaches, blurry vision and light sensitivity. An MRI of my  brain and spinal cord has been ordered for 4/29 to rule out other conditions.

The headache was so severe I felt if you drilled a hole in the top of my head air would spew out.  Additionally, on 04/10/21 I had soreness in the injection site, some pain in the right shoulder blade which felt like an inflamed bursa, some fatigue,&#43; dehydration (cotton mouth-dry tongue). After 04/10/21-todayI have had mild headaches occasionally during the week. I had started to have a mild cough since 04/22/21.

Headache for 3 days (above right eye, caused some vision changes), then sore throat, cough, brain fog, difficulty sleeping, along with body aches continuing.  Currently on day 13 and still have sore throat, coughing, brain fog, difficulty sleeping, muscle aches, congestion.  Also on day 3, eczema has been building on my face/neck.  Eczema has continued to get worse each day.  when I got the shot, I communicated to the nurse, I was maybe pregnant.  it was too soon to test.  That was Friday.  I had a positive pregnancy test the following Tuesday.  I&#39;ve since taken 2 more tests that were positive and have missed my period.  So safe to say i&#39;m pregnant.

They eventually after monitoring me for awhile sent me down to ER, by then my voice was raspy and scratchy, my lower lip was big, my tongue still felt big. I still felt nauseous. The dr asked me if my eyes are usually swollen and red and I said no. My extremities were still numb and tingling. I got epi and other drugs, zofran, benadryl, pepcid, I think a dose of steroids. The symptoms continued so I ended up getting a 2nd dose of epi. I went home around 5pm. When I woke up that evening to do a neb treatment I was nauseous, my lower lip again big, my tongue felt thick and this time my upper throat felt swollen, I gave myself epi and took myself to ER, they monitored me for 3 hrs the dr was gonna hospitalize me if I got worse, I still felt nauseous and the numbness and tingling feeling in my hands and feet when I left but was not having any airway issues when I left. Not sure if the numbness/tingly is gonna go away in my hands and feet.

                                                Patient came to the pharmacy to receive her Covid Janssen vaccine. On her vaccination list she stated that she is allergic to many thing including some foods and medication. She stated that her doctor still wants her to receive it due to her condition(immune system disorder). She came with her husband. They had a case with medications in case she experiences reaction. He had Benadryl and EpiPen in his case. First 15 minutes she was feeling fine, on the 25-30 min I asked them how was she doing and husband said she is not feeling very good. we measured her heart rate and it was around 150bpm.  Husband said her lips and tongue  are starting to swell. I asked him if they want me to call 911 but he refused. He preferred to take her home and observe. I called to check on patient few hours ago. He told me she was stable but her tongue is still swollen. I told them to go to ER if the symptoms get worse. He said she is improving and feeling better now

I had sweatpants, two sweatshirts, slippers and 2 blankets on to help. Later on I had fallen asleep to wake my husband to uncontrollable laughter and crying, mentally I knew what I was doing was not right but I couldn&#39;t control it. I believe my feve may had spiked so high that it was border line hysteria. By morning I woke and the fever had broke however I still had no appetite, terrible headache along with weakness and fatigue....I also tried food but ended up spitting it out because everything tasted strongly of metal. Sunday I was back to tasting to food and more energy.

But then on Monday I noticed a very tender left armpit, and I also have very itchy eyes, something I never have.  I also developed a small purple patch on my leg, and a little skin sore on my left arm.  It looks like more may be developing.

                                                I experienced tiredness a couple hours after receiving the vaccine. Shortly after, body ache set in. The following morning, I woke up with body ache and developed a headache soon after. The headache lasted all day. It became difficult to focus on anything else. I remember I couldn&#39;t even look at my phone screen because it hurt to do so. At times, I felt like the room was spinning around me. Later that night, I checked my temperature and had a slight fever, but it was only a degree or so higher than my normal temperature. I also experienced some chills throughout the evening. I went to bed early that night and woke up feeling like a brand new person with no remaining symptoms.

                                                On Thursday, April 8, 2021, between 915 and 945 AM, I received the Janssen/Johnson &amp; Johnson single dose COVID-19 Vaccine. As I have had adverse reactions to vaccines in the past, I was advised to wait at the vaccination site for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, and I did. Approximately 2 hours after receiving the vaccine in my left arm, I developed a red lacey-type rash all over my body. (This rash still persists today, Tuesday, April 13, 2021 at 3:37 PM and is relieved temporarily with consistent doses of Benadryl capsules, liquid or tablets.)  On Thursday night (April 8), after receiving the vaccine, I began to have body aches and to feel fatigued around 7:30 PM. I took 50 mg Benadryl, 500 mg acetaminophen, 800mg ibuprofen and went to bed. I woke around 12:30 AM and was drenched in sweat and my clothes were wet with sweat. I urinated and went back to bed and was shivering uncontrollably from the time I got out of bed until I got back in the bed and bundled up?it was several minutes before the shivering stopped and I went back to sleep. At approximately 2 AM, I woke up to urinate again. I had a terrible headache, like my head was in a vice; my tongue, throat, and nasal passages were very swollen, and it was difficult to breathe through my nose at all. I took an additional 50 mg of Benadryl and a 500mg acetaminophen and went back to bed. On Friday morning I woke to a phone call from work checking on me. I had slept through all of my alarms and it was 8:35 AM. I was unable to report to work that day and went back to sleep and slept for most of the day, only getting up occasionally to get a drink and use the bathroom. That evening I was able to get up and do a few things with the children and run to the grocery store, however, I became very fatigued and went to bed early without eating dinner.  On Saturday morning, when I woke up, I realized that I had slept for over 12 hours. I was groggy and fatigued all day and had a nap in the afternoon. That evening I was able to participate in family movie night and was feeling ok until about 10 PM. At that time, I began to feel very nauseated and had diarrhea, even though I had not eaten anything that would upset my stomach. I had intense abdominal cramping and felt like I would vomit if I moved around too much. I went to bed and had to get up to use the bathroom with diarrhea at least twice after the initial symptoms at about 10 PM.  On Sunday morning, I woke up after sleeping approximately 10 hours and was able to get up without feeling too fatigued. I did chores and errands and began to feel fatigued in the afternoon and took a nap for about 2 hours. That evening I also had to rush to the bathroom with diarrhea, however, there was no nausea. I went to bed at about 10 PM. On Monday morning, when I woke up, I felt very groggy and did not feel like I had gotten enough sleep. By the evening on Monday, however, I had begun to feel a little less fatigued and more clear-headed. As of Tuesday, April 13, 2021, I have had the red lacey-looking rash intermittently since having the vaccine. I am already on several OTC allergy medications for seasonal allergies and continue to take those medications, however, I have increased my Benadryl intake from 25 mg in the morning to 50 mg in the mornings with 25 -50 mg every 6 hours or so, as well. The rash improves for a short time while I am taking the Benadryl, but it reappears within a few hours after taking the Benadryl.

                                                Once my vaccine was administered I felt tingling on my tongue and bottom lip. I waited the 15 minutes and felt that the tingling was diminishing. I spoke to the tech and felt ok to leave since I was not experiencing loss of breath or swelling. After about 3 hours I noticed the tingling sensation coming back. I immediately called the pharmacist who administered the shot. After explaining the tingling was mostly felt on my lips and tongue but had no swelling and could breath and swallow just fine. I explained that it felt like when you get a shot for Dental work and that every time I touched the area it would tingle more. He told me that was not a normal reaction and would call in a few hours to check in on me. Sometime around 7 we spoke again and I still had no changes with the tingling. Again, he said he would have the pharmacist who was in call again the next day to make sure I was ok. By 11:30pm the aches in my joints started and I had chills. I woke up for work at 3:25am and noticed the tingling sensation wasn&#39;t as strong as the day before. Once I ate the tingling became more noticeable and was mostly on the right side of my tongue and throat. I also started experiencing a headache and sinus pressure. After arriving I work by 6am I felt exhausted. As the day went on the exhaustion  was becoming so strong I felt that I was fighting to keep my eyes open. The aches in my joints were becoming more intense especially in my hips and hands. At times I felt it hard to hold anything in my hand as closing my fingers became so painful it brought tears to my eyes. I also notice I was sweating profusely but had no fever. Once I was home I took a 2 hour nap. I woke up feeling the same the tingling in my mouth, aches still noticeable and headache still there. I could not stand and even tried to eat but had a loss of appetite. I called the pharmacy and reported the tingling was still noticeable. The pharmacist on duty explained the aches were normal but the tingling was not. I was advised to seek medical attention if I had trouble breathing or had swelling. The pharmacist told me to keep up on rest and fluids and I would recieve another call tomorrow to see how I was feeling. It&#39;s now 9:28pm and there are no changes to the tingling sensation in my mouth/throat. I still have aches and pains that are radiating throughout my body. My headache is still there but not as strong as this morning and I now have ringing in my ears. Every once in awhile I get some good stomach pains but they last a minute or two before going away.

                                                Felt fine at time of shot, a little achy afterwards but nothing concerning. My legs ached some a few days after but got better. About 3 days ago I started getting a major headache on the right side that also arrived with blurry vision, mental fog and mild dizziness. Nausea yesterday and today except the headache was much worse. I cried from the pain and this is when I became more concerned. My eyes, mainly the right side and a pressure in my sinuses were very difficult to bare with, subsided some with multiple doses of ibuprofen and Advil sinus but not by much. The headache is unbearable, painful to stand out bend over or move.

                                                On March 13th, 2021 I was given the opportunity to receive the Janssen Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid 19 vaccine so I decided to go ahead and get vaccinated.  Within 1.5 hours of receiving the vaccine, I began to feel unwell. It started with my left leg going numb. From there symptoms continued to increase. I got very tired could hardly stay awake. Then the chills hit. I could not get warm.  By the next morning (Sunday day 2) I had developed a low fever, headache, body aches and whole body weakness. I could still hardly stay awake still. When I was awake, I was very dizzy and I felt like everything around me was moving but I was not. My left leg still felt numb but I thought it would pass on its own.. Because of how I felt, I just laid around and rested. My injection site was swollen, Red and extremely hot to touch.  Next comes Monday (day 3), I got up that morning, still not feeling well. I made my way to work. That did not go well. The more I moved, the worse I felt. I was completely unbalanced and looked like I was drunk. I couldn&#39;t walk straight, I had to randomly grab onto chairs and sit down. I was feeling weaker by the minute. I left work at that point and went to see my primary physician that afternoon. At this point I could see straight to drive myself, could hardly walk as my left leg now dragged. I had no balance and having lots of dizzy spells at this point. He suggested I head to th ER but eventually decided we could wait until morning to see if things improved at all. If no improvement,  I was to go to ER. Tuesday Morning (day 4), my husband took me to the emergency room. I had reached the point of not being able to walk unassisted. At this point, the weakness and numbness I had on my left, had spread to my right side. We had no idea what was happening. We got right in and discussed what was going on. What lead up to me being there, etc. The ER ran blood work, xrays of my chest and 3 different MRIs trying to figure out if something happened like a stroke. NOTHING was present on any test they did yet there was something obviously wrong with me. My arm was still very Red and hot.. I had developed a lump in my arm where the vaccine was given. After ruling out everything the doctor could think of, he consulted with the on call neurologist since it was obvious to him something was happening with my neurological system. The diagnosis...my body was taking the vaccine as a toxin causing my neurological system to react and shut down. They felt that I should be starting feel better in the next few days as the vaccine settles into my system. I was told to follow up with a neurologist and my primary. I was then discharged from the hospital in the condition I had arrived.  Wednesday (day 5) I spent the day at home, not able to do anything. I napped most of the day. I still felt like crap and had no idea when I would start feeling better. No improvement that day.  Thursday (day 6) I woke up feeling a bit better. My right side was beginning to feel normal again but I was still feeling weak and unbalanced. This is also the day I meet with a neurologist to follow up. I don&#39;t know that this appointment had accomplished much as she didn&#39;t have access to all my medical records. She ended up prescribing me a medication to help with nerve pain I was having in my left side and referred me to do physical therapy. I am to follow up in 2 months.  Friday (day 7) my right side is back to pre-vaccine stage. My left is not. I feel pretty good except the occasional dizzy spell and the fact my left isn&#39;t working yet.  Day 8 and beyond...I&#39;m feeling ok. I went back to work but still have issues with my left side and residual dizzy spells. I began physical therapy 2 days a week to work on strengthening my left side however it has yet to help.  I am now just over 4 weeks post covid vaccine. I am now using a cane to help me walk as my left side has still not returned to normal. It is unknown if it will. I&#39;m in Physical therapy 2x a week still. The lump at injection site is now the size of a pea. I still have moments of unbalanced feeling and dizzy spells.

By the 25 minute mark, I noticed numbness in my cheeks, around my mouth and my forehead. I turned around and went back to the Health Department for observation. I sat with a nurse until I passed the hour mark for after the vaccine had been given. By that point, the numbness was gone around my mouth and forehead, but the numbness remained in my cheeks and they were visibly red where they were numb. At this point, I left the health department because my symptoms were getting better. It took about 2.5 hours for the numbness to gone in my cheeks.

                                                Approximately 9 hours after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA, I experienced sudden fatigue followed by onset of severe muscle and joint pain including severe head pain followed by severe chills followed by fever and excessive sweating. I was very dizzy and felt disoriented. I was in bed when all this happened and was already wearing warm clothes under the covers. The muscle and joint pain was so severe, I couldn&#39;t grip anything including my cell phone (my wrists were in sharp pain). The head pain was so severe I was sensitive to light regardless of how dim it was. I felt like my toes were curled, but that could have been me &#34;bracing&#34; and tightening up due to the total body pain. I could move very little. It was very strange. These symptoms persisted through the night. The following morning at around 9am, I still had a very bad headache that made me nauseated and continued to be sensitive to light. Some of the joint and muscle pain tapered down enough for me to get out of bed to go potty but it was exhausting to walk 5 feet to the bathroom and then get back in bed. I still ran a mild fever. At around 1pm I took a Tylenol that helped subside the symptoms but felt wiped out all day. By the following day (Monday), I was feeling better getting more energy and by that Monday evening, I felt like nothing ever happened. I&#39;m sure these just fall into perhaps the more severe level of the side effects, but I was frightened by the intense sharp muscle and joint pain to the point I couldn&#39;t even grip anything.

                                                As the vaccine was being administered into my left deltoid, the vaccine hurt at the injection site and I immediately felt very strange and felt a rushing sensation to my head and throughout my body, with a concentration in my upper body.  It felt like an out of body experience: I fainted, hitting my head on the adjacent wall and fell to the ground, where the impact caused a bruise to my shoulder and back.  It was reported to me that I lost consciousness for about 10 seconds.  I felt disoriented, but lucid when I came to.  I was not exactly sure what happened, but I could feel that I hit my head on the right side and asked if I fainted since I was disoriented and on the floor.  With assistance, I was able to sit back on the bench, but felt extremely dizzy, light headed, fuzzy/strange type of blurry vision, and intense sweating.  I did not feel well and knew I would have an unsteady gait if I attempted to stand.  After about 15 minutes, I felt well enough to return home.

                                                Within 5 minutes I started to have flank pain on the rightside. Was having a panic attack so couldn&#39;t breathe well. Flank pain started spreading to my side and mid to lower back. Then it started in the left side. Then it went across my whole mid back and got extremely stiff. Part of my top lip is numb. Over 4 hours and I still can&#39;t breathe properly despite the use of my anti anxiety medicine hours ago. Neck pain. Legs walking in slow motion no matter how hard I tried to push them. Hyperventilating after coughing 2 or 3 separate times. Shooting pain in my back when I lay down. Can&#39;t catch my breath laying down.

                                                Starting around two weeks post-vaccination, I noticed what felt like cold sores / dry mouth around my lips. There were no visible sores, but some redness and maybe a slight swelling. I treated with some OTC items (kanka, peroxdyl) and it subsided a few days later. Then about a week ago, symptoms returned and I had a telehealth visit with my Primary Care doctor on 4/9. She prescribed Acyclovir and recommended Vitamin B12 complex, in addition to using aquaphor to assist with the dry lips. She did not indicate that it was the vaccine, but did not rule it out, so I wanted to report the reaction. While this has helped, it has still not fully improved, and I will be seeing my allergist on 4/19 for a follow up as that was her recommendation if it didn&#39;t go away.

It&#39;s not bad, but it&#39;s more difficult for me to breath through my mask, especially when I&#39;m talking. When I&#39;ve been talking for a while, I can&#39;t quite catch my breath. Also, I&#39;ve slightly lost taste. Food tastes a bit &#39;off,&#39; and some items even taste bitter. I had cake the other day, and, to my disappointment, it was bitter (my family said it tasted fine. It was just me). Also, for two and a half weeks from the onset of they symptoms, I had intense flu-like symptoms. I felt achy all over and fatigued, which chills. I found it odd because it started so late and lasted so long. The flu-like symptoms are the only things that have subsided.

That day afternoon she started noticing generalized headache acute onset and was continuously present for following 4 to 5 days.  She had 1 day of headache free symptom.  And she started noticing fluctuating intermittent headaches since that time until today.  She still has headaches ongoing today.  A week ago she also started noticing nausea which is been ongoing and blames mostly for headache.  It is intermittent and denies any vomiting.  No abdominal cramps diarrhea or constipation or blood in stool.  She also started noticing dizziness 5 days ago which was more intense and frequent at that time but for the last 2 to 3 days it has become in less frequent.  She walked to the clinic today for the fear of driving and dizziness.  Denies any blurry vision but does have photophobia.  She also complains about loss of appetite but she mentions it is coming back today.

                                                I got the vaccine on 4/7/21 at approx. 10am. Soreness at injection site started about an hour later. At approx. 3pm that day I began to have body aches and chills and had a low grade fever and a very bad and continuous headache. Those symptoms lasted approx. 24-36 hours. By Friday 4/9, I was feeling better and fever was gone. Starting approx. Sun 4/11 I began to have a dull headache wrapping around the back of my head/neck and began having muffled hearing (bilateral, but more prominent in left ear). On 4/15 at approx. 1:15pm I was sitting at my desk and suddenly my heart rate went from resting heart rate to 150. I could feel the pounding in my head and ear and also placing my hand over my heart. I tried to stand up to walk around thinking that might help my heart rate, but I felt faint, so I immediately drove myself to urgent care. My heart rate came down and was back to normal approx. 5-10 min from onset. EKG and CT were done in the ER. I was released approx. 5-6 hours after arrival and told to treat headache with Tylenol or Ibuprofen (which I have not done so far because I normally try not to take medications), and follow up with my primary doctor in a week. Headache and muffled hearing are still present today (4/17), predominately affecting left ear.

                                                Received shot around 2:10 pm. Experienced some stinging at injection site within a few seconds that became uncomfortable for several minutes then disappeared.  At 2:40 texted spouse that my face was tingling.  Started in cheeks and upper lip and spread to nose. A few minutes after that I started having hot flashes and my face was flushed.  Hot flashes lasted for an hour and subsided, tingling has mostly subsided except for area of cheek closest to my nose (it is 6 pm now).  Did not formally check into the urgent care facility but did contact them to see if this was normal.  Was advised to take antihistamine and, and if symptoms worsened to go to ER.  Symptoms did not get worse.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 vaccine was administered to patient and the patient immediately reported pain at injection site, change in taste, and trouble breathing. Patient began gasping for air. The patient remained aware and able to communicate. I instructed a tech to call 911 and the operator instructed me to use a dose of epinephrine. After administration, the patient&#39;s breathing improved. EMT&#39;s arrived and took over care for the patient. I informed them of the time of vaccination and the time of epinephrine administration. The patient was then taken to the hospital to receive additional care.

                                                Received vaccine at 4:10pm on Thursday 4/8/21. 2 hours later, at 6:15pm, I noticed mild tongue swelling which slowly continued to worsen. I pulled out my Epipen but was not having any difficulties breathing and my tongue was only mildly swollen still, so I took Zyrtec at 8pm (which I usually do), and continued to monitor. Zyrtec seemed to slow the progression of tongue swelling slightly but at 10pm, I started having a dry cough and wheezing. I took Albuterol and Benadryl and that worked to stop the tongue swelling. Please note, the reason I don?t use Epi immediately is because I have Reynaud?s and it is contraindicated. So I use other rescue meds first if I can. My O2 sats remained above 95%, so I was not in full anaphylaxis. I did not eat anything or come in contact with anything within those 2 hours that would have caused the allergic reaction, so I am positive it was the vaccine. I also have a red, raised itchy bump at the site.

                                                Normal side affects felt: fever, chills, body aches. Felt by 5pm and lasted until the next morning ~0700. After symptoms broke, the feeling of sluggish occurred all next couple of days. Throughout, it seemed like I could not quench my thirst.  Additionally, red bumpy rash on my legs (mostly thighs) occurred and itching along with it on legs. Not enough to go to emergency room, but definitely uncomfortable. Took Benadryl to help. Subsided about a week later. At injection site, only bruise which I am guessing was from some abnormal bleeding that occurred at injection. I barely had any soreness in the arm.  Lastly, a feeling of inability to take a deep enough breath. A feeling of if I had vicks on my chest type cool feeling when I took a breath. The feeling has lingered until now, but not enough to cause any issue. I can breath, but not full deep breaths. Because it has been getting better every day, I imagine it will subside soon. I will go to doctor if it does not get better.

                                                April 7th about 6:30pm: I became very confused, having trouble remembering where I was or answering simple questions.  Around that same time my vision became blurry, and my face in and around my mouth became numb, I began to slur as a result.  The numbness and slurring increased over the next hour or so.  After that hour or so, I realized I was exhausted and my head hurt so I went to sleep. I also had a strange emotional response to all of this, I behaved giddily and as though it were funny.  April 8th about 8am: I woke up and the confusion, blurry vision, numbness, and slurring were gone.  I had a mild headache, brain fog, and was still more tired than usual.  Later that evening the headache developed in to something more like a migraine, intense pain focused behind my right eye and blurred vision.  At this time I again decided to go to sleep.  It would have been about 8pm.  April 9th about 8am: I woke up still feeling a moderate headache focused on the right side, still tired, and brain fog.  The symptoms weakened throughout the day and by the evening I was feeling mostly normal again.   I have felt healthy and normal since.

                                                The following symptoms occurred 12-36 hours after covid-19 vaccine dose: Light sensitivity, severe migraine, increased urine output, decreased water intake (couldn?t pick up the bottle of water, severe muscle weakness &amp; pain, nauseated, lethargy, skin sensitivity (could touch my skin and wanted to cry when sheets touched my skin), loss of appetite.  26-30 days after dose I had a series of migraines.  I have only ever had one other headache in my life that I would consider a migraine.  I was sensitive to light and nauseous from the pain.

                                                * Arm was very sore for about the first 10 minutes.  Moving it reduced it pretty quickly and was no worse than a minor ache for most of the next day or so. * Had a mild headache before the shot (believe due to not having had caffeine that day yet) * At about 6 pm on 4/10, lost appetite due to mild nausea (just enough to not want to eat but not enough to vomit) * At about this time I noticed I also started to feel a little winded, akin to walking just briskly enough that you have to breath harder than if you&#39;re just sitting / resting.  It did not get any worse than this however, so I opted to keep a close eye and see if it eased (which it would by end of Sunday, 4/11) * At about 8:30 pm on 4/10, noticed I felt warm, had a fever between 100.4 to 100.8 * Also around 8:30 pm I noticed that pain I normally feel from my herniated discs and pinched nerves (L4/L5 L5/S1) just ACHED and was more painful than normal. * Started feeling tired (I&#39;m usually up until around 1-2 am, and I was ready to go to bed by 9pm on 4/10)  Also felt a little forgetful / hard to concentrate on anything * When I went to bed, I noticed that my eyes were very sensitive to the white light from my monitor.  This is usually a sign of a painless migraine with auras that essentially blind me for about a half hour.  I did not have auras, though my headache was steadily getting worse to the point I suspect it might have actually been a migraine) * At about 12:30 am on 4/11, the headache got to the point where I could no longer ignore it (best I can describe is it felt like someone was trying to peel my skull of like you would an orange) so I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen.  I also by this point had a fever of 102, though it would drop to 100.5 or so within a few minutes of taking the Ibuprofen. * At about this point the arm starting aching a lot more, I assume because I wasn&#39;t using it while sleeping.  It felt like someone had punched me multiple times hard in the same spot. * I felt much better on the morning of 4/11.  However as the day continued I felt more and more tired.  My temperature was higher than normal but very mild; it stayed around 99.8 for most of the day that I took it.  By Monday, 4/12 I felt mostly fine aside from my arm aching worse than it did when I first got the shot.  Now on 4/14 its pretty much no longer achy.

I woke up at 1am the the next day (4.10.21) with a severe migraine and my heart racing. The migraine was so severe that just bending down made my head pound with extreme pain. I felt very hot and was sweating profusely and my clothes were soaked. I was also very thirsty and drank several glasses of water. I took 4 ibuprofen as it had been 8 hours since my last dose and laid back down in bed and tried to relax. I fell back asleep within 1-2 hours. I felt fine the next morning but did have a slight headache, but it was nothing compared to what I woke up to during the night.

                                                Within 5 minutes of receiving the injection, my vision started going blurry for things up close. Then it was restored after a few minutes. The next morning, I was unable to read on a device (eg phone or laptop) and I was unable to read my books between 1? and about 3? from me. I could read items farther away but not up close. My blurry vision went in and out for several days (until Thursday afternoon) when I went to acupuncture and it was restored by that treatment. My vision has been clear ever since then. I even took 24 hours off of all technology between Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday afternoon and my vision was still blurry Wednesday when I went back to reading from my phone.

I have an IUD in place (placed in December 2017).  The first 24 hours after receiving the vaccine,  I had mild symptoms of headache, low grade fever and aches from the neck up. 2 days after receiving my vaccine, my period began and continued as a light period until April 14, 2021.  I continued with headaches in the temporal region and experienced light headedness and blurred vision throughout the day (still continues as of today 4/19/21). I went to my primary physician on 4/15/21 and was sent for labs (CBC, CMP, and TSH level), an EKG (after hearing an irregular heart rhythm), and a MRI of my brain. All of my labs and MRI were reported as normal. My EKG showed occasional PVC&#39;s.

                                                Around 1am Tuesday, April 6th (the day after the vaccination), developed acute onset fever (Tm 102), chills, extreme muscle aches, profound malaise/fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea.  Those symptoms lasted about 24 hours and, by midday Wednesday, she was back to her baseline of intermittent dry cough, shortness of breath, and no smell or taste.  It wasn&#39;t until Sunday, two days ago, that she developed sharp, pinpoint right superior parietal scalp pain that, after a few doses of OTC Aleve, did somewhat improve.  Other than two 220 mg OTC Aleve tabs twice daily, she has not been taking anything else for her symptoms other than prescribed asthma/allergy meds. She states that her shortness of breath has been helped from the use of albuterol as needed.  Unfortunately, the Aleve has not helped with her chest pain, which she describes as a &#34;constant ache.&#34;  Initially, patient had some pleurisy, but that has apparently cleared up.     No history of CVT, PE, and she does not smoke or take oral contraceptives.

As I walked to the restroom to vomit I lost 100% of my vision, I became very disoriented and had the loudest screeching in both ears. I screamed for my husband and I caught me as I was taken to the floor with no mobility. The episode last several minutes before he was able to move me back to bed. I had severe sweating and ear ringing. As I report this I still have a lingering brain fog and ear ringing.  I reported it to my physician and told to go to the ER if any reoccurrence of reaction.

Burning feeling at injection site continued for several hours.  Brain fog and chills set in within 2 hours post injection.  Fatigue, headache, and joint stiffness and pain started about 4 hours post injection.  Injection was given on left arm; left hand became painful about 4 hours post injection, as though someone had put it in a vice.  Joint pain worsened.  Upon laying down to sleep, I became so cold I could not get warm even with an electric blanket on high.  Started to feel stabbing pains in my jaw, back of my neck and down behind my shoulder blade on my left side.  Headache worsened and started to feel pressure in my ears.  Joints, my knees in particular, felt like they were made of gravel and someone was stabbing them with a hot poker.  Did not sleep due to pain.  Has been 20 hours post vaccine, injection site is still very painful and swollen.  Joint pain, headache, fatigue and chills continue.  Was unable to go to work today.

Couldn?t open eyes or move fingers.  Light headed...blacking out when I got up to go the bathroom.  Couldn?t have any sounds (like tv) on.  Just needed to lay still and sleep.    The above lasted 19 hours.    Then my temperature ended.  I had trouble walking and standing for another 20 hours. No stamina.   I went to work near the end of this and noticed I had trouble looking at my paperwork and figuring what to do for my job.  Not sure if this was still the fatigue just in a different way.  Then it disappeared.

The patient stated that immediately after receiving the vaccination, she felt a shooting pain in the injection site. The patient stated that within a few minutes, she felt lightheaded and nauseous. The patient then stated that within 20 minutes, she felt like she was having an asthma attack and had to use her rescue inhaler (albuterol HFA). It was reported that the patient left the pharmacy about 45 minutes after receiving the vaccination and the patient stated she was feeling better. The patient the reported to the pharmacy that the morning of April 7, 2021 that her symptoms of shortness of breath and wheezing returned and she went to an emergency room for treatment. The patient stated that after admission into the ER, the medical staff performed two EKGs and one chest X-ray, which were unremarkable. The patient stated she received treatment with Duoneb because she was wheezing and and treatment with IV methylprednisolone because her throat and tongue appeared swollen. The patient stated she was discharged on April 7, 2021 and was prescribed albuterol solution for nebulization and prednisone 10 mg tablets.

She injected the shot less than two fingers down from my shoulder bone, much higher than I have ever had an injection given before.  I immediately felt intense pain, and the intern had trouble pushing the syringe down fully.  She said ?I need help!?, and her male manager ran over, and quickly jabbed the syringe further into my arm, and pressed extremely hard down on the syringe, forcing the remaining contents into my arm. I immediately felt a shooting, searing pain down my entire arm, into my wrist, and  my arm went numb, felt heavy, and tingly by my hand.  The manager pulled the needle out of my arm, and said ?you must have hit bone, the needle is bent?.  I then felt extremely nauseous and woozy, and my vision started going in and out.  I fanned myself and after about five minutes my vision stabilized, and I felt less nauseous.  It is now 9 hours later and I have intense shoulder and neck pain, and limited range of motion of my shoulder.

The cotton mouth, fatigue, headache and fever of 99.9 to 101 lasted until about 8:00am on 4/8/2021., where I had a second set of chills and the fever broke.  On 4/9/2021 I still had fatigue and had to leave work early as I couldn&#39;t multi-task and had a hard time staying focused.  The inability to focus and fatigue lasted 4/10/201 and 4/11/2021, just walking up and down my stairs at home exhausted me.  On 4/12/2021 I went back to work, my focus is better but still not back to where it should be, I still get exhausted easily and everything is a bit too bright.  On 4/12/2021 about 7:30am, I had a bloody nose that took a while to stop (about 30 minutes), that is not normal as I rarely have a bloody nose; I was late to work due to it and had another one while at work around 11:40am; it was not as bad as the first and stopped after approximately 10 minutes.  Today is 4/13/2021- Things are still a little too bright and my energy level is not quite back to normal, I also have a slight headache.

                                                Immediately at 15 minutes: blurry vision; felt off and felt loopy (out of it);  I was dropping food on myself as I was eating. My pupils were really small. I felt out of it. Finally I got home (son drove me). I had mild chest pains and heart racing (had this initially, too). And the chest pains and heart racing kept happening off and on through the night. I had headaches that night and I felt nauseated. Next day, I had to wear sunglasses inside my  house as I was light sensitive and my pupils remained small. I still felt body aches and nausea but the eyes were the biggest concern...shining light by my eyes didn&#39;t make my pupils bigger. The light that came off my phone aggravated my eyes and my head. Thursday, I still had nausea but headache wasn&#39;t bad with Tylenol. Those full two days all I did was sleep. Friday, I felt like things were mild and Tylenol was helping. I called heathline for my eyes. As those still weren&#39;t improving. I got into my eye doctor for an exam (4/9). There was no inflammation and he decided to dilate my eyes. Of course, my eyes were blurry and my eyes responded to that dilation. I napped after returning home. My pupils after the nap were finally responding. I still had a little light sensitivity in my eyes but not as much as I had had and pupils were doing what they should with light. So this was 3 1/2 days later. I still do get mild headache and mild chest pain - it comes and it goes. I have a doctor appt - general check up  - that was already scheduled for tomorrow and he will examine for chest pain.
