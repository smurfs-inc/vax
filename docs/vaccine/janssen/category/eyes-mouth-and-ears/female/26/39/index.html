                                                Around 8 pm (about 6 hours after receiving the vaccine) I started to feel typical flu symptoms such as chills and aches, and I had some body shaking as well. I was in bed that night and the symptoms kept getting stronger, and around 11 pm I started to feel tingling throughout my body, mostly in my hands and feet. It was very uncomfortable to lay still and I felt I&#39;d never be able to fall asleep if I couldn&#39;t lay still. I took 10mg of Z-Quil around 11:30 pm. My body and skin was also starting to get very hot, I never took my  body temperature but I probably had a fever. I put a cold compress on my forehead. I also took 1000 mg acetaminophen and 400 mg Advil. I got up to use the bathroom and I could walk but my balance was off and I felt tingling up my legs. I laid back in bed with the cold compress again and the tingling in my hands and feet increased. I tried walking around again and again felt tingling up my legs. I sat on the edge of my bed moving my feet around which helped the tingling, but when I laid down again the tingling kept coming back. I took another 10mg of Z-Quil and 0.25mg xanax (prescription for anxiety). I finally decided to move to a chair with lots of pillows so I could sit upright since that helped reduce the tingling. I finally fell asleep sometime after 12:30 am. I woke up in the chair around 2 am and was feeling better - no tingling, no body shaking, chills and aches were reduced and body temperature didn&#39;t feel as high. I was then able to sleep in bed for the rest of the night. The next day I still had aches and chills and a fever but it was manageable with Advil or acetaminophen, and by Monday (March 8) I was able to go to work.

                                                Hi, I received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine one week ago, Thurs March 11. On friday, I experienced the typical flu like symptoms - chills aches pains and fever. These have slowly gone away, but a week later I still have chills and constantly shake, and diarrhea. The most significant side effect I want to report is extreme vertigo and dizziness and headaches. These have been present for a week now and have prevented me from working and doing daily activities. I constantly feel like Im going to fall over and cannot see clearly. I previously had vestibular migraines, but these have been mostly gone due to going to the chiropractor and taking my supplements. The vaccine brought them back now in full force. I read that this is becoming a commonality among other people and need answers on this. I want to make sure its not permanent or that I will have this as a serious side effect.

                                                Patient was found unconscious laying back in her chair shortly after receiving her Covid-19 vaccine.   Patient was awoken with a light shake on the shoulder, but not to noise.  The patient stated they had difficulty hearing, along with nausea and light headedness.  The patient denied any other symptoms, including difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, and body soreness.  Nothing was administered on the pharmacy&#39;s end.  The paramedics arrived shortly after and took the patient as she was going in and out of consciousness.  Patient was contacted after the incident, in which she said that she was told she had vasovagal syncope.  The patient is fine now.

                                                I noticed a very mild headache and slight coldness within 2 hours of my vaccine.  Onset of my severe symptoms began around 10PM on 03/12/2021 with a stabbing headache (Felt like someone took an air pump and kept &#39;blowing up&#39; my head. My eyes felt achy and heavy and every time I looked in a different direction I would get a zapping/electric feeling throughout my head that would cause my head and neck to spasm (longer duration) or twitch (quick jolt). This also caused dizziness). I got really cold and had intense shivering and shaking. Around midnight, my skin started feeling bruised all over my body (very sensitive to touch, including my bed sheets against my spine felt like rubbing up against a wound). At the same time, my joints (especially my neck, hips, and knees) got hot to the touch and were incredibly painful (induced tears). My muscles developed a deep ache that also caused significant pain. I felt very weak and confused. I didn&#39;t take my temperature until the early morning, and it was 102.9 at that time. I alternated taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen throughout the day, but my temperature stayed between 102 and 103.1 for about 24 hours, as did the previously noted symptoms.   I noticed a gradual improvement of my symptoms over the next two days. On the evening of 03/14/2021, my headache worsened some, and I had an unexpected episode where I nearly passed out (dropped to the floor but stayed conscious). I also had intermittent foot tingling (very noticeable, not mild) over the course of a few hours.   For 3 full days (but by far the most severe within the first 24 hours), I experienced some strange sound processing. Things like the sound of a car driving by or the ceiling fan felt like it echoed throughout my whole body and gave me an uncomfortable shivering feeling.   As of today (03/16/2021), I am mostly recovered. I am still experiencing fatigue, a very mild headache, and some mild pain. My nausea has completely resolved, though that was never a chief complaint of mine.   I realize that some of my symptoms are to be expected with this vaccine. But especially the level of pain I experienced throughout my entire body was very concerning and not something that I was aware could happen as a result of the vaccine.

                                                I awoke at 6:45 a.m. feeling a bit sore in my arm, but relatively okay.  I was up for approximately ten minutes and then extended my arms over my head to stretch out some of the achiness and immediately regretted the action.  I began to feel dizzy and nauseous and saw black spots encroaching on my peripheral vision.  I washed my face to relieve some discomfort with no change.  I walked toward the bedroom to grab my glass of water when the black spots increased, clouded my entire vision, and I collapsed on the bed.  I then began to hyper-salivate and after waking my husband and catching my breath, I returned to bathroom, experienced diarrhea, and simultaneously vomited into the trash can.  The vomit tasted chemical and extremely acidic.  My body was also shaking uncontrollably during this time and I kept switching between chills and being too hot.  After I felt comfortable leaving the bathroom, I crawled back in bed but was shaking so much that I couldn&#39;t stop my teeth from chattering and could not get warm no matter that my husband placed an extra blanket over me.  I had taken my temperature before while I was in the bathroom and it read 94.6 degrees Fahrenheit.  I took it again in bed about twenty minutes later and it read 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.  My head was splitting and my arm ached, but I was eventually able to go back to sleep.  I felt better after sleeping for a few hours and drinking more fluids.

                                                Around 4 pm I was starting to feel a little sore. By 4:30 pm I had some major chills that turned into hot flashes. At around 4:30 pm I took 400mg of Ibuprofen. For 1 hour I was fighting a fever and chill spells that rapidly changed during that 1 hour time period, ending at 5:30 pm. Within that time I had major acks in my back and neck. I also experience sinus pressure and pins and needs in my ears and behind my ears. After 5:30 pm I did feel significantly better and now are 8:00 pm I feel exhausted, my head hurts and my ears feel like they weigh a pound each. Hope that was helpful. Thanks for doing what you&#39;re doing.

                                                After receiving the shot, I was required to sit down for 15 minutes. About 5 minutes in, I started to become dizzy, my vision started blacking out, my hearing was muffled, I became clammy, sweaty, and experienced mental disorientation. It became harder for me to breathe, but I never struggled to take a breath. I drank some water and waited for the symptoms to subside. I remained seated and these symptoms went away within 5 minutes. After feeling better for about 5 minutes, I felt cold and was shivering. The woman sitting next to me was completely fine after her shot. I&#39;ve since felt a slight burning sensation on my skin in areas that I have scratched lightly. I&#39;m also experiencing strange feelings throughout my body- specifically my head, leg, and hand. It feels like I can feel something in each area for a bit and then it subsides after several minutes.

                                                Around 3:15 in the afternoon, I began experiencing severe aches and muscle pains, combined with a growing migraine. Not realizing what it may be related to, I took two ibuprofen and I&#39;ve acetaminophen.  By the time I around home around 6:30, I could barely hold myself up. I ate dinner, which only helped minimally, and by 8 pm felt like death. My husband notice I looked red and felt my forehead, immediately going for the thermometer. I had a fever of 100.5.  We eventually got me into bed after downing a lot of water, but the pain would not ease up. The pain was too excruciating. At 10:30 my husband came to bed and we took my temp again which was 101.6. To help me sleep I took another Tylenol. At 5:45 my work alarm went off and I checked my temp again; still 101.6. I got a cold pack for my migraine and went back to sleep. Slowly throughout the day my fever dwindled, until it finally broke in the early afternoon. By 4:15, as I am writing this, all that&#39;s left is done tiredness, thirst, and a small bit of achiness.

                                                Immediately after getting the shot, I experienced dizziness, nausea, a wierd taste in my mouth,, and my tongue felt numb. The day after I recieved the covid vaccine Janssen, I started noticing the injection site getting red and swollen. By the next day it had grown in size and was itching rather badly. I could sleep from how badly it was itching and burning. It has been 6 days since I got the vaccine and it&#39;s still large and swollen and really itchy. I have been taking ibuprofen for the pain and using benadryl for the itching.

I went to a dark room and about 30 minutes later it stopped where a wasn&#39;t seeing a flashing line.  I took melatonin and went to bed figuring I was starting to get tired.  I woke up at 638am. Arm super sore, a red spot over the size of a quarter at injection site. Low grade 99.1 and my entire body hurts and a small headache. Called in to work to rest for the day.

Woke up Sunday with 101 fever, aches, took Tylenol again and sweat it out. Fever went away completely but had nausea and diarrhea. That lasted 2 days. Tuesday morning started feeling congested, sinus pressure ringing in ears when laying down, Thursday noticed mild smell and taste. Tested positive for Covid via a rapid test. Friend who had vaccine same day same exact symptoms also tested positive, were never near each other and no one else around me is sick.

I had body aches and a severe headache. My temperature was 104.7 with the thermometer. My breathing was as if I worked out but was just sleeping. I called an ambulance and was taken to health center where doctor took over care.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I began to feel nauseous, almost like being car sick while looking at my phone. I also began to feel tightness in my chest. After my 15 minutes were up I asked the administrator of my shot if it was normal that I felt dizzy/chest tightness. They said it was probably fine and just to monitor my  symptoms. I went and sat in my car a few min and I began to feel very strange, it seemed very bright out, I felt weak, and my eyes felt very heavy. I wanted to get home so I started driving but on the highway, my heart beat was very fast and I began to feel like I couldn&#39;t swallow. At one point felt as though I might be about to choke so I pulled over because I thought I was going to have to dial 911 as my throat was feeling like it was closing up. I tried swallowing a few times with great effort and after a few minutes the sensation started to lessen. My throat hadn&#39;t closed up completely, however it did feel like it had swelled up.

My pregnancy has thus far been really easy with no complications.  I had a low grade fever that I took Tylenol to treat.  I had pretty bad muscle and joint pain, chills, and could not stop shaking.  I just felt freezing.  Once my fever broke I felt extremely hot all night.  The next morning I was exhausted and had a lot of the muscle and joint pain still.  I marked on my report that it would&#39;ve stopped me from going about my normal daily activities, as I could not have gone to work and spent most of the day resting.  For the next few days I was tired and my eyes ached.  On Monday and Tuesday I had a headache in the afternoon.  Yesterday afternoon my eyes finally stopped aching and everything seems to be back to normal.

Then later around 10:00am a feeling of tiredness came over my whole body.  Around 12:00pm I felt even more tired, lightheaded  and my eyeballs felt as if with high pressure in them and are feel sensitive to the sunlight.  Also, at 12pm, I had lunch, which was my first meal of this day and felt the necessity to lay in bed and take a nap for 20 minutes before returning to work.  While taking the nap I felt tingling on my feet, arms, hands and neck along with certain sudden muscle contractions on the same parts.

                                                After being administered the vaccine at 7:12 am, when the nurse stood me up and started to walk me to the holding area, I became dizzy, my legs got weak, and there was a loud ringing in my ears. I nearly collapsed as I reached the seat in the holding area they were taking me to. I placed one 0.5MG tablet of my prescription Alprazolam in my mouth and waited for the nurse to bring water. They took me via wheelchair from the holding area to a secluded spot behind a curtain. There, I laid on a cot, received cold water, and a nurse talked to me while I recovered. It felt like I was having an anxiety attack, which has never happened to me after getting a shot before. Fitbit heart rate data shows my heart rate at 105 BPM at 7:00 am (going through the admission process, walking around the facility), 83 BPM at 7:10 am, 79 BPM at 7:15 am, 74 BPM at 7:20 am. Between 8:15 am and 1:25 pm, my heart rate remained between 63 and 89 BPM. My arm was sore and my skin hurt (an issue that I have when I feel very stressed). Additional symptoms arose around 1:35 pm. I began going through cycles of chills, sweating and overheating. My heart rate ranged from 127 BPM and 93 BPM for the remainder of the night. I took Tylenol at 7:07 PM to help with my fever.

I wasn&#39;t able to get up and my arm swelled up really bad.  I was having streak in my vison and really bad dey eyes and mouth.  I had a fever on going for about 3 weeks straight. I called my Doctor the following day and she said it was a normal reaction, if it get&#39;s worse to call her again. I called her again because it got worse, my neck got swollen. left arm was trembling, lymph nodes were swollen, leg leg was pulsating. I started having chills and hot flashes ( I still have some till this day). My Doctor recommended seeing a specialist- Neurologist, Infectious Disease Dr.  The Neurologist said he can see where I get the trembles but does not  want to put me on medication and see if it goes away on it&#39;s own. I have a follow up with him regarding trembles, headache, flashing in my eyes. The Infectious Disease Dr. I&#39;m following up her her again regarding my arm swelling, they prescribed me steroids but had not gone down.  Since all of this I have been very fatigue, this is everyday.

                                                I?ve never had an allergic reaction to anything before.  Received the vaccine at around 9:55am on 03/08/21.  Pain while the vaccine was being administered but it healed within a few minutes. I started getting a mild headache at around 3:30pm while at work. When I got home at around 6pm I started having severe chills, the headache became intense, my mouth and eyelids felt hot, my hands and feet felt very cold and when I checked temperature it was 102.4.  By 9:00 pm the headache became excruciating like I?ve never had it before, as if my head was being squeezed or pressed. Eyes and the back of my jaw hurt too.  Had light and sound sensitivity. Took 200mg of Advil but pain was still almost intolerable until I was finally able to fall asleep at around 4:00 am.  Was still in pain the day after but not as bad as the night before. Only mild pain today but started feeling itchy tonight and noticed some rashes on my body.

I started to develop a low grade fever 8 hours after the shot. 13 hours after the shot, I had a 104.1 fever. Along with the fever, I experienced severe body aches and chills, nausea and a horrible headache. I couldn?t walk as my body was so weak and my vision was blurry. About 15 hours after the vaccine, my fever went down to 102. I was able to get up and walk to my kitchen to take some Advil. My fever broke 20 hours after the vaccine with the medicine. I?m still experiencing severe body aches, headache, nausea and chills and it has been about 30 hours after vaccine. I did have covid 3 months ago, and the symptoms from the vaccine were much worse than the symptoms I had with actual covid.

                                                Most websites said 1-2 days for side effects to kick in but I was rocked pretty hard within the first 12 hours. The biggest symptoms I had were severe body aches, debilitating chills, fluctuating fever, headache, and no appetite.  4/1/21: * 11:15am: Vaccine administered * 12pm-6pm: Arm soreness, feeling cold/experiencing some chills, minor headache and stomach ache (I felt a little off but couldn?t tell if it was real or in my head) * 5:30pm: I walk home from work, which takes about about 35 minutes. Regret the decision about 10 mins from home due to onset body aches and fatigue  * 6pm: I go straight to bed freezing with crippling chills, body aches, and a headache * 8pm: Extreme nausea kicks in, I take Advil and cannot stomach more than one bite of food; still experiencing chills and body pain * 9pm: 100.7 fever, the chills subside and I start to get hot * 10:15pm: I finally eat some food, drink more water, body still aches, start to get chilly again  * 10:45pm: My fever is down to 99.3, my ears really hurt, like, ear-infection-style pain  * 11:15pm: 12ish hours post-vaccine, I have severe body aches, I alternate between really hot and cold, take more Advil and go to bed (finally fall asleep at midnight)  4/2/21: * 6:15am: Wake up; I spent the night tossing and turning with extreme night sweats. At this point I still have a pretty bad headache and painful body aches, specifically in my lower back and legs; fall back asleep * 8am-9am: Wake up and take more Advil. My whole body hurts. Toss and turn for a bit more. Small fever?99 degree temperature. Make coffee but have absolutely no appetite. * 9am-10am: So sweaty, fever is fully breaking * 11am: No more fever, slight headache, and body aches seem to be subsiding * 11:45am: Almost exactly 24 hours later and feeling good, comparatively speaking. Finally eat a bagel * 5:30pm: After lunch, I took a nap. My body aches have completely subsided, no fever. I still have a small headache and my ears still ache. But overall, I feel pretty normal! Just a little tired but probably from lack of sleep last night.

                                                About a minute after I had the injection, my arm started hurting and it felt like hot water was coursing through my veins. I got an immediate headache that progressed into light headedness, my vision got blurry and I saw colors and then I started to lose my hearing, it felt like there was cotton in my ears. The nurses said I went pale and they called it a panic attack, but it was unlike any panic attack I have ever had in my life. I?ve had my TDAP updated a few years ago and got a flu shot and did not feel anything like this. I was rolled out of the room on a wheel chair because I was too dizzy to walk and then threw up several times into a bag and peed myself. It took about 20 minutes before I felt normal again.   The following day my arm felt numb and incredibly sore, I couldn?t raise it that far up without excruciating pain. I felt weak, fatigued and dizzy and was unable to use the bathroom. I had fever sweats and chills on and off. I was not able to sleep well, but I think that?s because of the pain in my arm.

On day two I am feeling better but I still have minor body aches I do get fatigue while doing light work around the house and no appetite and loss of taste is the newest symptom. I am not 100 percent better but close to it.

I was happy to be vaccinated and kind of saw it as my mini booster for my immune system that already beat COVID-19. As I sat there, the only thing I could say is, I felt a tingling cold sensation moving from my arm through me. Almost like I could feel the vaccine moving through my system. The tingling kept moving and I thought to myself, okay cool. I guess it&#39;s working. Awesome. But then my head felt cold, I felt tingling in my head, my mouth tasted like metal, saliva started to build in my mouth, I started to sweat, I felt overly sweaty all over my body, but my head felt cold and tingly.   I was staring straight ahead and everything started to go staticky, like a television set, and the static began to build and started to get starry. Everything in my vision started to fade. So I spoke out to say something weird was happening.  A man came over to talk to me and hold me up. He kept saying stuff but then my ears started ringing and I couldn&#39;t hear him anymore. I began to fade out as the stars got more intense. Then, as if it was just a mini reboot, my brain started to come back online and the picture in front of me began to fade back into view. I felt nauseous and still had a super metal taste in my mouth. They called the paramedics to give me a checkup. The metal taste in my mouth stayed the longest, but after about 45 minutes I felt well enough to go home.  On and off, I have this intense tingling inside my brain. It reminds me of a time when I was in the hospital on morphine. Just a tingling pins and needles sensation inside my head. Other than that, I am okay now. But I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s some sort of reaction because I already had COVID-19.

After 12 hours, nausea and headache set in. 13-14 hours, a terrible stomachache and diarrhea. My skin felt so sensitive that it hurt to touch. Zofran treated the nausea. The day after the injection I was exhausted, was nauseous and had a headache. 48 hours after injection I woke up with a strange headache. I could look to the right pain free, but if I looked to the left or left/up, I had a piercing pain near my right eye. Excedrin/Tylenol did not relieve this headache. On Hour 72, the headache is still present, though to a lesser degree.

They eventually after monitoring me for awhile sent me down to ER, by then my voice was raspy and scratchy, my lower lip was big, my tongue still felt big. I still felt nauseous. The dr asked me if my eyes are usually swollen and red and I said no. My extremities were still numb and tingling. I got epi and other drugs, zofran, benadryl, pepcid, I think a dose of steroids. The symptoms continued so I ended up getting a 2nd dose of epi. I went home around 5pm. When I woke up that evening to do a neb treatment I was nauseous, my lower lip again big, my tongue felt thick and this time my upper throat felt swollen, I gave myself epi and took myself to ER, they monitored me for 3 hrs the dr was gonna hospitalize me if I got worse, I still felt nauseous and the numbness and tingling feeling in my hands and feet when I left but was not having any airway issues when I left. Not sure if the numbness/tingly is gonna go away in my hands and feet.

I had sweatpants, two sweatshirts, slippers and 2 blankets on to help. Later on I had fallen asleep to wake my husband to uncontrollable laughter and crying, mentally I knew what I was doing was not right but I couldn&#39;t control it. I believe my feve may had spiked so high that it was border line hysteria. By morning I woke and the fever had broke however I still had no appetite, terrible headache along with weakness and fatigue....I also tried food but ended up spitting it out because everything tasted strongly of metal. Sunday I was back to tasting to food and more energy.

                                                I received the vaccine on Friday afternoon at 4 and woke up on Friday night being extremely nauseous followed by chills and sweats. Saturday I felt achy and a little unsteady when I got up or walked around (these reactions I expected). Sunday morning I woke up covered head to toe in hives that lasted for three days. I have never had hives so bad before. I called the pharmacy and was instructed to take Benedryl which didn&#39;t work. I took Allegra on Tuesday which seemed to help clear them up by the end of the day.

By Wednesday, this was very difficult to handle and I went to see a practicioner at my primary care office and I could not sleep at all on Wednesday night; went to the ER on Thursday morning out of major concern.

I started getting very cold and shaking around 10:00 PM. My finger nails and lips started getting pale and my temperature started rising. The shaking stopped around 12:15 AM, but my fever continued as high as 101.4 throughout the night and into the morning. I continued taking Tylenol and the fever went away the morning of 3/12/21, but slight chills returned around noon that did not last long. I took more Tylenol that evening for a headache and noticed I had an on and off throbbing pain in my right ear.

I took ceterizine and Benadryl with no relief. I missed the following Monday of work due to my eyes still be swollen. My lips started swelling by Wednesday. Only one side of my upper lip would swell at a time or one side of my lower lip. By they following Saturday my lips were still swelling at any given time. Monday March 29 my  bottom lip started swelling at 1:45 pm and by 2:30 pm both eyes were swollen. I had tremendous pain behind my left eye which caused me to go to the Emergency room. I was given IV meds and had prescriptions ons waiting for me at the pharmacy the next day. My eyes were still swollen the following Tuesday the 30th. I am on a steroid and to antihistamines to help prevent this from happening again along with Benadryl, ibuprofen for pain.

                                                Approximately 9 hours after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA, I experienced sudden fatigue followed by onset of severe muscle and joint pain including severe head pain followed by severe chills followed by fever and excessive sweating. I was very dizzy and felt disoriented. I was in bed when all this happened and was already wearing warm clothes under the covers. The muscle and joint pain was so severe, I couldn&#39;t grip anything including my cell phone (my wrists were in sharp pain). The head pain was so severe I was sensitive to light regardless of how dim it was. I felt like my toes were curled, but that could have been me &#34;bracing&#34; and tightening up due to the total body pain. I could move very little. It was very strange. These symptoms persisted through the night. The following morning at around 9am, I still had a very bad headache that made me nauseated and continued to be sensitive to light. Some of the joint and muscle pain tapered down enough for me to get out of bed to go potty but it was exhausting to walk 5 feet to the bathroom and then get back in bed. I still ran a mild fever. At around 1pm I took a Tylenol that helped subside the symptoms but felt wiped out all day. By the following day (Monday), I was feeling better getting more energy and by that Monday evening, I felt like nothing ever happened. I&#39;m sure these just fall into perhaps the more severe level of the side effects, but I was frightened by the intense sharp muscle and joint pain to the point I couldn&#39;t even grip anything.

I fainted at table, then my spouse didn&#39;t know when he came downstairs, he thought my head was just resting at the table. He asked if I wanted to walk to the couch to rest, and as he helped me do so, I fainted and he caught me and carried me to the couch. Recovered within 1 minute but my hearing was  fuzzy for a couple more minutes, sounded like static in my ears.  Other reactions were:  Standard ones I read could happen- Fever of 100.1 that lasted less than a day, chills, aches, warm feeling and fatigue.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 vaccine was administered to patient and the patient immediately reported pain at injection site, change in taste, and trouble breathing. Patient began gasping for air. The patient remained aware and able to communicate. I instructed a tech to call 911 and the operator instructed me to use a dose of epinephrine. After administration, the patient&#39;s breathing improved. EMT&#39;s arrived and took over care for the patient. I informed them of the time of vaccination and the time of epinephrine administration. The patient was then taken to the hospital to receive additional care.

                                                Approx 12 after shot I woke up feeling very ill and nauseous. As I walked to the restroom to vomit I lost 100% of my vision, I became very disoriented and had the loudest screeching in both ears. I screamed for my husband and I caught me as I was taken to the floor with no mobility. The episode last several minutes before he was able to move me back to bed. I had severe sweating and ear ringing. As I report this I still have a lingering brain fog and ear ringing.  I reported it to my physician and told to go to the ER if any reoccurrence of reaction.

                                                Immediate injection site pain including stinging and burning.  Site continued to sting for over an hour post injection.  Burning feeling at injection site continued for several hours.  Brain fog and chills set in within 2 hours post injection.  Fatigue, headache, and joint stiffness and pain started about 4 hours post injection.  Injection was given on left arm; left hand became painful about 4 hours post injection, as though someone had put it in a vice.  Joint pain worsened.  Upon laying down to sleep, I became so cold I could not get warm even with an electric blanket on high.  Started to feel stabbing pains in my jaw, back of my neck and down behind my shoulder blade on my left side.  Headache worsened and started to feel pressure in my ears.  Joints, my knees in particular, felt like they were made of gravel and someone was stabbing them with a hot poker.  Did not sleep due to pain.  Has been 20 hours post vaccine, injection site is still very painful and swollen.  Joint pain, headache, fatigue and chills continue.  Was unable to go to work today.

Couldn?t open eyes or move fingers.  Light headed...blacking out when I got up to go the bathroom.  Couldn?t have any sounds (like tv) on.  Just needed to lay still and sleep.    The above lasted 19 hours.    Then my temperature ended.  I had trouble walking and standing for another 20 hours. No stamina.   I went to work near the end of this and noticed I had trouble looking at my paperwork and figuring what to do for my job.  Not sure if this was still the fatigue just in a different way.  Then it disappeared.
