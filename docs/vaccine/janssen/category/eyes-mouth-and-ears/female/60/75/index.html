                                                Eight hours after the shot, I quickly became very chilled with total body aches and pains and extremely tired.  My mouth became very dry.  This lasted most of the night.  The next morning approaching 24 hours after the shot, the initial side effects were gone but I then had a headache and a bit of nausea.  Again was extremely tired and pretty much rested all day.  All side effects were gone the next day.  I felt no need to call my healthcare provider and did not take any over the counter pain medication.

                                                I had the most peculiar taste in my mouth. It wasn&#39;t entirely a metal taste, but it was strong enough it overwhelmed the taste of everything else for about 6 hours. I could still taste other things, but the primary taste and the one that remained in my mouth was this odd, almost metal taste.  The next day (after the taste was gone)-  it would have been almost 24 hours from the time of the injection - I was hit with a bad headache and body aches like I haven&#39;t had in many years. The body ache was gone the next morning, and the headache lingered another day past that. Today, Tuesday March 9, is the first day I feel like myself again.

Overall I felt as if I had a terrible case of the flu. It was very intense. I was unable to sleep the first night due to the severity of symptoms. The second night I sweated a tremendous amount and my fever broke. I am still not over all of my symptoms but I am feeling better.

Initially stated she could breathe/swallow just fine but very quickly stated the swallowing was getting more difficult. 911 was called  followed by 0.3 mg EpiPen in her right outer thigh and 50mg of oral Benadryl. Her BP was then taken around 4:45 and it was 162/93 at which point EMT arrived and took over.

                                                Worst headache ever - intense pain when walking or moving head, nausea. Dr told me to take 4 ibuprofen 3 times per day. I took 2 3 times per day. The headache and nausea lasted 4 days. Headache is milder but still present, especially with head movements. Ringing in ears, moderate tinnitus from the day I got the shot and it still remains.

                                                Sensitivity started within four hours of dose. Autistic sensitivities to maximum. Scrambling of all senses including proprioception to the point of not being able to move from standing  or sitting. By hour seven, all sensory inputs were too overwhelming to do anything but shut down and sleep. 911 was not an option because they don&#39;t let you sleep, and ERs are overwhelming already, before maximizing all inputs. 7.5 mg hydrocodone for overwhelming pain and sensitivity, allowed sleep. On waking, sensitivity was lessened, but the pain started, 18 hours after the vaccination. Emotional lability for three days. Average aching of arm and injection site were not above expected levels. &#34;Brain fog&#34; and lack of ability to articulate (another autism symptom) started within that first seven hours, and diminished over next ten days. Not yet gone as of today  Dry mouth; overproduction of thick &#39;chunky&#39; mucus that wouldn&#39;t cough out, treated with guaifenesin, lasted three days. Shortness of breath and cough associated with that mucus also diminished after three days. Not completely gone ten days later.   Excessive thirst, onset two hours after vaccine, lasted two days.   Hyperalert (can&#39;t sleep without drugs), hyperactive despite weakness, and hypervigilant (extreme startle reflexes) lasted three days as well. Sleep was achieved with hydrocodone and THC.  All over body pain, feelings of immune mobilization (coming down with) for two days were not above expected levels.   No fainting or other collapse at time of injection, or later.  Knowing that severe over-stimulation is exacerbated in a medical setting, it was decided not to seek medical support for three days of systemic symptoms that would have easily merited hospitalization.

                                                A few hours after the Thursday afternoon injection, my temp shot up and stayed right around 102, my heart rate was 135- just sitting, and my oxygen level was 93%. I shook uncontrollably the first 10-12 hours, and had chills. Tinnitus. Nothing inproved until the middle of Friday night- I sweated through sheets. Still had fever, high heart rate, and up and down oxygen for 18-20 days. My heart rate (I&#39;m on 2 anti-arrhythmia drugs so my rate is rarely above 65) was still high but better by day 22. Fever is also better but not gone. Exhausted.

I went to work on Tuesday because my work was short staffed but was allowed to go home 3 1/2 hours early.  I took Advil every 4-6 hours on Tuesday and half of Wednesday.  I came straight home and slept until dinner, ate and then went back to bed and slept until midnight, took more Advil and drank a full glass of water, and slept the rest of the night.  Wednesday I felt a bit better, headache not as bad and jaw pain not as frequent, still pretty tired.  I went to bed straight after dinner and then felt great on Thursday.

                                                The day after the vaccine was administered (April 5, 2021) I woke up with headache, fatigue and I developed ringing in my ears. I went to urgent care, as I had pain in my ears. They washed out my ears because they had wax, the pain was relieved, and the tinnitus diminished, but I still have the ringing in the ears a week after the vaccine. It has subsided some, and is most noticable at night.

                                                Developed heart palpitations approximately 10 hours after receiving vaccine. Also insomnia  making it impossible to sleep.  Palpitations seemed to get better by 11 am the next morning but my heart rate was still elevated ( pulse 106-112).  Shortly after that ( around 11:45 am) I became extremely light headed and dizzy and felt like I was going to pass out. I also started to feel nauseous and sweaty.   I rested lying down for two hours before hearing back from my doctor&#39;s office.  I was able to control the lightheadedness and dizziness by lying down. The feeling of passing out / nearly fainting went away.  I continued to feel nauseous and my  heartrate was still elected. I started to get a headache as well.  On the advise of a nurse at my doctor&#39;s office,  my husband took me to the ER.  My EKG was normal . My heartrate was elevated.  Due to the overcrowding at the ER that day I was made to wait at least an hour and half for further evaluation.  I continued to feel light headed and slightly dizzy. My nausea and headache got much worse .  I was finally taken back to a treatment room and received IV fluids, Zofran and Tylenol.  My heartrate went back to normal and my headache and nausea improved with treatment and I was discharged around 7pm.  I continued to feel very tired and slightly lightheaded that evening. The next morning  I was much more nauseous again and still very weak feeling and slightly lightheaded. I have  continued to feel weak, very fatigued , unwell and nauseous on and off until today, April 14, which is 6 days after I was vaccinated.

                                                Started on Monday morning at 8:30 am started feeling cold chills.  Took 800mg of Ibuprofen and after an hour felt better.  When going to bed around 9:00pm I noticed that my skin was soaking wet and that I had a hot feeling.  When I woke up in the morning  (tuesday April 13, 2021) around 7am I could not fully open my eyes.  I looked in the mirror and noticed that my entire face was swollen and was red in different areas.   I took some benadryl as I thought this was an allergic reaction and went back to bed.  A litter later I started getting cold chills and then hot flashes.   Around noon time I took another benadryl.  By 2:30 I was not feeling any better and I also had body aches and pains and called my doctor.  I was able to get in to the office.  I was told that I was having a reaction to the shot and that I was boarder line for the hospital.  They gave me a shot steriod shot and prescribed Metheylprednisolon tablets (24) to be taken as directed and to continue to take benadryl.   It&#39;s now Wednesday morning April 14, 2020 and the swelling has gone down but not fully gone and I have stated on the prescription.  I now have redness in my chest area.  I still have a some chills and hot flashes.

Was on a walk and went home and sat in a chair. 4 hours after injection my neck and upper back was killing me. I have had a previous injury from a car wreck 40 hears ago. I slept in the chair that night and the next days on a heating pad. My back felt like a horse kicked me. The next day my eyelids were too heavy to lift for about the duration of a movie. I could not fall a sleep, but could not lift my eyelids. I had vaccination on Friday night. I could not stand any sunlight until Sunday. My sinuses were killing me and the back of the head. On Sunday afternoon I could eat chicken broth and drank lots of water. By Sunday night, I felt fine and ran 5 miles on the treadmill. Feel great now.

                                                I took 1 Benandryl about 1 hour before the injection of the vaccine prior to leaving my home.  My son took me as I would anticipate some type of reaction given my history.  J&amp;J was the one my doctor recommended in hopes that I could handle the response better and only need 1 dose. I had options to get pfizer or moderna, but my dr wanted J&amp;J so I waited several weeks longer to get this one.  Within 10 minutes of having the injection, my  ears swelled up, and felt like I was on a bad plane and could not burst clear.  Then my throat on left side, the same side I got the shot swelled.  My face was full of red and rash and my son mentioned he was concerned how I looked.  I told him my symptoms and then took another Benadryl before we left the store. I told the pharmacist that I was having a reaction, they wanted to call 911-I said please no. I am used to having reactions and would want to see if I can manage it with Benadryl at home.  I came home and took my Alegra (as I take my alegra at night before bed to help with congestion).  Going forward every 2-3 hours I would take another benadryl rotating the time frames and slept as much as possible. It took several hours for the swelling to subside, longer than I was used to.  Over the next several days, I would have times when my ears, throat would swell, my face would be red and rashed, especially at night my face will get red, rash and ears and throat swell late at night. It waxes and wains depending on how I feel.   After the main allergic reaction of 12-24 hours later, I stared with the COVID symptoms, fever, chills, body ache, the joints that I have trouble with hurt so much more (knee, foot, arms, hands) I was so thankful I did not catch COVID. I don&#39;t think I would have survived. On Friday, March 19, 2021 was the first day I started to feel better except for the late night episodes of allergic reaction. I take Alegra or when needed Benadryl. It seems to lower my swelling response.

                                                Was out shopping with friends and feeling fine but when driving home I noticed a high pitch sound in my left ear that abruptly started for no known reason.   I have pollen allergies to trees and due to staying indoors and wearing a mask I was having no bad allergy symptoms and never had tinnitus on my worse pollen day.   The tinnitus symptom was loud enough to notice over all other noise and very irritating in a quiet room.    The high pitch sound was non stop and constant.  I went to sleep that night and woke up Saturday morning still hearing it.  I felt that morning like I was having a very mild cold with very mild congestion.  I felt likeI had swelling under my ears    I was not tired but I did feel like staying in bed and sleeping  as if my body was mildly requesting it.  I slept most of the day.  Woke up with the high pitch sound but it seemed a little bit lower in volume.  Around 8 pm the sound left as quickly as it came

In the morning it seemed getting better but then my symptoms got worse.  I took two Ibuprofen which helped. I still continued to feel tired. After my vaccine, I also got a weird taste in my mouth. I was very tired over the weekend. My armpit itched and so I scratched it and I felt raised bumps under my armpit, under the pit of my arms on both sides, right greater than left. My left arm was the one vaccinated. I also had bad diarrhea on 03-29-2021. Today I still continue with the rash under my armpits and still feel very tired and fatigued.

                                                The next morning, 09:00 am, I had mild flu symptoms which was full body aches and feeling feverish and unwell. I didn&#39;t register a fever on the thermometer. I was very tired; no appetite. I stayed resting all day. Slept a lot. It was easy for me to sleep - very unusual. By 9:00 pm that all lifted and I was feeling back to normal. The morning of March 28, I woke up with a very sore throat. And on 3/29, I had really continued sore throat on and off and Tuesday it got much worse. There was a really strange sensation of being extremely thirsty - I had never had experienced that before. Swollen gland on the right side of my throat - between the jaw and ear area. I had a little bit of an earache on the right side. I drove by the drive-in testing area. I am working in person each day so I get the drive by testing - I think Tuesday, the 30th. Called the dr and did the Telehealth visit - Wednesday - the 31st. I had in and out of laryngitis - raspy voice and headache. I looked in my throat with flashlight and could see a definitive red spot in back of throat and some white spots.  They said it could be a blocked salivary gland and told me to eat something very sour to activate it. Over 6 to 8 hours it did clear the issue somewhat - thirst went away. I still had a sore throat. They told me that by the weekend, I could maybe start antibiotic. Saturday night I took first dose of Zpack - two tablets at first dose and then one tablet a day after that. By late evening Sunday (Easter) I felt some relief of symptoms. This week I still have a little bit of raspy voice and post nasal drip and clearing my throat at this point. I am recovering but not fully recovered.

She called 911, EMS did full evaluation on her (vitals included) and said maybe she was just having an anxiety attack.  EMS instructed her to take Benadryl. Patient did not want to. Patient called pharmacy and explained symptoms to me, the pharmacist who administered the shot.  I told her it sounds like it was related to the vaccine and that I would report her reaction to VAERS. I told her it might be a good idea to take Benadryl.

                                                Began having chills about 7 hours after the injection. On the early afternoon of 4/8.   Developed excruciating headache (very similar to when I had Covid previously in Sept. 2020), all over body aches, ringing in my ears and temp. 101.  Unable to sleep during the night and excessively thirsty.  Was essentially bedridden for 36 hours when headaches and body aches subsided on Saturday morning (4/10)  Have only had a few brief headaches and some exhaustion since Sat. Morning.  Of note, I have been donating convalescent plasma and platelets since my  illness in September, 2020.  On March  28 (approaching 7 months after my illness) I was still positive for Covid Antibodies prior to the vaccine.

She has an extreme splitting headache to where she feels her brain is going to go out of her head.  She has also had numbness and tingling down the right side of her body and into her tongue.   She cannot get to feeling better, she just keeps feeling worse.  She has taken Tylenol/Ibuprofen, and dr. put her on prednisone and gave her a Z-PA to see if this will alleviate symptoms.   Nothing she has taken has helped with it.   She feels as though her brain is swollen and that she going down hill.  She is a cancer survivor and cannot determine if having that has made her worse.   The pressure has gone to her ears, feels like it is going to burn her ear drums up.  She also has tinnitus with it as well.   She also has tinnitus and the headache that will not go away.   She has called her doctor many times and hasn&#39;t gotten any results back.

Began at around 10am. Felt like I was dying. Placed on Stroke Unit. Scans and tests all negative for stroke and Drs. thought could be panic attack or TIA. Since then my lingering effects point to TIA, Seemed to clear up around 2pm with gradual improvement through the day. Still experiencing some side effects including tinnitus, memory and word retrieval issues, fatigue, anxiety.  DO NOT HAVE PANIC ATTACKS. The only time I have had a panic attack was at 26 after the death of my mother.

It then just kept getting worse and worse and then went to the other ear. Then there was a buzzing at night inside her head.  She started getting head tremors inside of her head, and it has not stopped as of 4/29/21.  She called her doctor and talked to him and he gave her Zyrtec, however, she is very very sensitive to medications so she could not take a lot of it.  It didn&#39;t help the right ear which is the worst one.  The left ear just started to subside a little bit.  It has now been on and off, but still pretty severe in the right ear.  The head tremors feel like shaking inside of her head which are not apparent from the outside, and the buzzing.  She had another phone APT again and she is scheduled to see a specialist an ENT on 5/3/21 as the condition is debilitating.  She is not able to sleep, eat or function due to this condition.

                                                9 hours later began feeling a general &#34;ick&#34; like when coming down with something, then moderate headache and body aches, especially my back. This lasted less than 2 days.  Other things, mostly starting 5 or 6 days later and some cropping up as late as 4/11.    Random itchy red rashes on each shoulder and back of upper arm that would go away within an hour or 2.   Itching and possibly bumps on buttocks and thighs.  Intensely itching palms for a little while on 2 or 3 different days.  Sudden appearance of a 4 x 4 inch patch of 15-20 bumps of various sizes in the crook of my left elbow (injection arm) with bright red skin. These looked similar to mosquito bites or blisters but didn&#39;t itch. It completely disappeared without a trace within an hour.    Tingling tongue followed by tongue swelling on 4/6/21.  I had eaten my bran flakes with some rice pudding a little bit before this, both of which I&#39;d eaten every day for the past week or so and had had several times in the past. On the advice of my doctor&#39;s nurse, my husband drove me to an urgent care center. By the time we got there, probably 1.5 hours after this started, the swelling was some better. The nurse practitioner that I saw prescribed an antihistamine and 3 days of one 20 mg prednisone pill a day. I&#39;ve never had a tingling or swelling tongue before in my life. I took only a half of one prednisone on 4/6, no Allegra.  On 4/7 the random itchy red rashes mostly on arms/shoulders happened once or twice and disappeared fairly quickly, but my upper lip swelled. I could feel it happening as I sat in my recliner in the morning. I hadn&#39;t had anything to eat yet. The doctor advised I take my Allegra and prednisone I received at urgent care on 4/6, so I did. The lip swelling gradually went down over a few days, but it still feels irritated on the inside of the lip as of 4/11.   Diarrhea beginning around 1:30 a.m. 4/8. Lasted about 3 days. I only very very rarely have diarrhea.  Mild sore throat starting Friday 4/10. Better by Saturday. Sore throats are so rare for me that I can&#39;t remember the last one, possibly several years ago.

In the middle of the night my headache kept getting worse, my eyes started to hurt really bad and I also broke out in hives. About 6 hours later my headache felt like it wanted to explode. I saw a doctor through Tele-health by  who prescribed a 6pk of steroids.  Then on Day 6, my headaches came back along with the hives and I felt really tired and the hives broke out all over my body including my crotch and ear canal. He prescribed a 6pk of steroids and I started to feel and get better. On Day9, all of my symptoms were resolved except for the fatigue. To this day I still continue to have fatigue.

Fifteen minutes later I walked out, driving down road with friend and I said &#39;something is wrong&#39;; really bad &#39;metal taste&#39; in mouth, blurred vision, grabbed her arm and said I am going to throw up, I was so dizzy and I said I can&#39;t think. My face was drooping, I couldn&#39;t say my A,B,C&#39;s, and by the time I got to the ER they got me on an IV. I couldn&#39;t talk, think, and had the metal taste for a few hours. The dr. said we are going to give you fluids, my BP was elevated for 6 hours 198/130, no clots. BP went down to  178/98, taste started to go down, I was drinking fluids, I was able to talk a little bit. I felt like in a &#39;bubble&#39;, I couldn&#39;t think. When I was discharged I had no temp, my BP was normal.  *my body reacted to the vaccination.  *6 hours my body reacted *body had felt like I was recovering from the flu for 2 weeks *Never ran a temperature

Her blood pressure was 174/86 and her pulse was fluctuating in the mid-high 80s. I administered 1 tablet of diphenhydramine (25mg) and 1 dose of the 0.3mg epi-pen. After about 7-10 minutes, she said her symptoms started to level out and were no longer getting worse. Her lip swelling started going down by the time EMS arrived. I continuously checked her blood pressure, heart rate, and heart rhythm while waiting for EMS to arrive and take over her care. They took her to the closest emergency room for continued monitoring.

Benaydyl was given and an Epipen was used, I was taken by ambulance to the local hospital ER where an IV was started, steroid was injected.  I was kept several hours for observation and sent home.  The following day I had attacks of itching and rashes as well as occasional numbness in my lips, by Thursday evening it was worse, returned to a different hospitals ER at 2am Friday morning, more steroid was given and I was observed, and sent home with an prescription for an epipen as well as steroids.  Continued to take Benadryl often taking two with in a half hour, Monday May 24 went to my own docotor, as I had a new reaction of pressure in both ears with pressure in my cheeks and around the back of my head.  She give me a prescription for additional steroids and is still monitoring me as I am still reacting.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included hypertension, hypothyroidism, and intermittent pancytopenia, and concurrent conditions included metronidazole allergy, hashimoto&#39;s disease, and microscopic colitis. The patient was previously treated with metronidazole.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 1805018, and expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 09-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included amlodipine, levothyroxine, losartan, rosuvastatin calcium, and ubidecarenone.  On 09-Mar-2021, the patient got the vaccine and after few days she had aches and pains (very mild reaction) and went to bed early. The patient thought she was fine. On 18-Mar-2021, 04:00, she woke up with an excruciating headache above her left eye in her eyebrow. The patient wondered if it was an aneurysm and took 2 tablets of extra strength Tylenol and it helped. The patient stated that after every 5-6 hours, excruciating headache came back. The patient had the same headache for over a week. The patient got tested for Covid-19 and it was negative. The patient thought she had sinus problems but had no other symptoms. On 30-Mar-2021, the patient woke up with headache. Her eye was killing her, was sore and swollen, and felt like it was going to burst and her left eye was swollen shut in a couple of hours. The patient narrated it was excruciatingly painful. The patient&#39;s husband drove her to urgent care, where ophthalmology tested the pressure: right eye was normal (she thinks it was 18- normal) and the left eye was 51 (normal is 14-19), units unspecified (intraocular pressure decreased). The eye doctor started prednisone and the patient had a CT scan and lab work done. MRI was also ordered but they were unable to do it right away. On unspecified date in Dec/2020 the platelets were 349 in December and came down to 64, which was very low (low threshold was 150) (thrombocytopenia). The CT scan was performed, they thought she had a cavernous carotid fistula and she was scheduled for an angiogram for a further diagnosis on 01-Apr-2021. The angiogram determined she did not have fistula. The patient was admitted to the hospital after the angiogram and on 02-April-2021, MRI was done. All throughout the process, the ophthalmologist, radiologist and internist all thought it was related to the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. The prednisone started working and the pressure started dropping in her eye. The patient states that doctors think an artery burst behind her eye. After discharge, the patient was taking prednisone which was helping. On the 13th, she was watching television and saw that the vaccine was being put on hold due to the women with clots whose progression matched hers exactly (severe headaches, low platelets, and required attention). She was on prednisone for a month. Laboratory data (dates unspecified) included: COVID-19 virus test negative (NR: not provided) negative, CT scan (NR: not provided) Not reported, and Platelet count (NR: not provided) 64 (units unspecified). Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included: prednisone, and paracetamol. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from thrombocytopenia, intraocular pressure decreased, ocular discomfort, periorbital swelling, and eye pain, excruciating headache on 02-APR-2021, and aches and pains on 12-MAR-2021, and the outcome of artery burst behind her eye was not reported.

                                                The Pt presents with swelling of her lips 20 minutes following injection of 1 dose Janssen vaccine to the left deltoid. The Pt states that she has had anaphylaxis in the past to Macrobid, Sulfa, Amoxicillin. She has an Epipen at home but states that she has never had to use it because her symptoms develop slowly. In the past she has driven herself to the ER where she has received breathing treatments and observation. Pt denies swelling of the eyes, tongue, throat tightness, difficulty swallowing, itching of the skin, SOB, CP, nausea or vomiting. She also denies dizziness, lightheadedness, or vision changes. The Pt also has a Hx of meningioma and SVT s/p ablation.   Suspicion for anaphylaxis high due to lip swelling, wheezing, and previous episodes of delayed onset anaphylaxis. Pt drove herself today so IM injection of diphenhydramine was delayed. Upon recheck Pt?s wheezing was unchanged and lip swelling had not progressed further. Due to past episodes of SVT and no progression of current symptoms, epinephrine was on stand by but not administered. Care was transferred to EMS.  Care was transferred to EMS and Pt was transported to the hospital.

                                                Experienced all common symptoms as well as other I have not heard of. Mental fogginess began at 8 PM (8 hrs after shot) and lasted until late the next evening Chills began at 8:30 PM and continued until early Friday AM. There were also a few instances of hot flashes in between the chills. About 10 hours after the shot the following began: headache (I rarely get headaches), nausea, muscle aches - mostly my quadriceps, low back pain, pain in the back of my neck, general lethargic feeling. These all lasted into Thursday evening, except the low back pain, which lasted into Friday AM. I felt a dull pain in all my back teeth that lasted about a day and was intermittent.

Symptoms began on 3/7/21, woke up horizontal binocular diplopia at 8:30am. Has been constant since it started. It is worst when looking to the left and best looking the right. Worse in the distance. No other associated symptoms   3/13/21: Around noon, was just sitting in the chair. She reports that she got a bad headache and then the entire left side of the body from head to toe was numb and burning in the left side face. This lasted all day, but completely resolved by night time.  Had never had anything quite like that in the past. She had a headache that started soon before the numbness, that also lasted most of the day.   3/15/21: was seen in ED with reported normal MRI, CT, and EKG   MRI brain with a small left pons lesion near the cranial nerve 6 nucleus   She was seen by Neuro-ophthalmology Dr. (attending), Dr. (fellow) 3/17/2021 &#34; MRI brain on 3/15/21 did not reveal a structural etiology for diplopia.  Differential diagnosis includes microvascular ischemic left 6th nerve palsy versus possibly post-vaccination cranial nerve palsy (received COVID vaccine 2 days prior).  Also on the differential diagnosis but less likely, includes myasthenia gravis (she did not have expected abduction saccade slowing of the left eye typical of an ischemic cranial nerve palsy).  Thyroid eye disease also would be less likely.  We will obtain antibody testing for myasthenia and thyroid eye disease.  Today we applied a 10 prism diopter base out prism over her left glasses lens.  I instructed her to remove this when appropriate, as I expect her diplopia to gradually improved.&#34;  4/7/2021 acetylcholine ab receptor negative, TSI negative, TSH receptor antibody negative, LH/FSH normal,

I alerted the person at the vaccination site saying something was not right and then they called the paramedics who took my vitals and said my heart rate and blood pressure was extremely high. They gave me a shot of Benadryl and oxygen because I was feeling shortness of breath. They kept me until about 11:35 in observation when I felt myself again. The headache, nausea and body aches stayed for about 2 weeks but all other symptoms subsided.

                                                2 hours after receiving the vaccine, I grew exhausted and had to sleep into late evening and was chilled,  had a fever of 101 and developed severe pain and inflammation on the top of my collar bone that was feverish and migrated toward my shoulder region on the same side as my vaccine. Ibuprofen would not help with the pain but helped with the fever. My mind told me that I had things to tend to the next day, but still was forced to sleep off and on for 2 more days. After a week and a half, not only did I have thirst, but also food didn&#39;t taste right and was metallic.  This lasted for 2 days and finally my taste was restored. The exhaustion lasted off and on for 2 weeks and I just listened to my body. The pain and inflammation on my collar bone has subsided 4 days ago but still have pain in my shoulder when I sleep.  On April 5 around 8:30 a.m. a nasty virus hit me out of the blue. I grew week and tired and had to go to bed. I slept all day until around 9:00 p.m. and woke to uncontrollable diarrhea and fainting spell while in the bathroom. I had abominable pain and nausea that last for a half hour and then I returned to bed. The next 2 days, I was week and exhausted but continued with my regular routine.  My equilibrium is still affected from time to time.

Then on the 15th or 16th I noticed that the roof of my mouth was hurting, was sore. So I asked my husband to check it for me because I could not see it very well and he said there was a sore on the roof of my mouth. Yesterday I asked him to check again and he said it was even worse. I am going to see a doctor today, appointment today at 12:30PM. I also saw another Dr. also at the same clinic on 04/14/2021.

Every tooth in my mouth started throbbing at around 11 hrs  and continued for about 5 more hours. Also during that time, waves of nausea but no vomiting, also uncontrollable shivering but I wasn&#39;t cold and I wasn&#39;t hot but weird shivering. I did not take my temperature as I didn&#39;t feel like I had a fever. Around 13 hrs after a stabbing pain in front of thighs like hot pokers started and around 14 hrs thigh pain was still present but then the calves on both legs started to get the same stabbing pain.   At around 24 hrs after - headache remained, pulsating teeth stopped, thigh pain stopped but calf pain remained. Headache remained off and on for several days. General brain fog also lasted for about 1 week. The calf pain comes and goes even after 2 weeks. Arm where shot was administered was very tender to the touch for the last 2 weeks.   Lastly, I wouldn&#39;t say I had shortness of breath but at times I just felt like I needed to stop and force myself to take a very deep breath.

Runny nose and sore throat.  My fever went up to 104.8 for about 3 hours then came down to 102.5 for the remainder of the first night.   Felt better the next day on 5/11/21 but got a fever again that night.  Today I feel a little better and my taste buds seem to be coming back a little.

                                                Sun I woke in middle of night with pain in thumb. There was nothing there. When I got up few hours later my thumb on left hand had enormous blood blister.  Which immediately grew, was infected, and whole hand swelled up.  Wednesday night I had same pain under right eye. Again nothing was there. Few hours later my eye was all swollen.  I have another Dr appt tomorrow with Dr.  I had the emergency room take care of my thumb. That Dr, Dr  , a few days later sent me to Dr.

Left side -left leg started getting swollen - it started in middle on knee part - the swelling went down my leg to my ankle and up my leg; up my thigh . It was like there was fluid in my leg. There was no pain.  It went like that for 1 1/2-2 months. Just had to let it run it&#39;s course. I was being treated for it and had tests run to test for blood clot. She prescribed 800 ibuprofen  for it; that didn&#39;t work. That same day of the vaccine, I also broke out with a fever - 102. And fever blisters all over my mouth. I had those for about a week.

                                                Patient received J and J covid vaccine on 3/7/21. She did not feel well for the next few days and had the following symptoms: headache, fatigue, nausea, body aches, loss of taste. She recovered after a few days and was doing well until 6/11/21. She began having the following symptoms: migraine headache, nausea, dizziness, loss of appetite, blurred vision, weakness, loss of taste, muscle weakness and joint pain. She went to ER on 6/13/21. They did a cat scan and ekg, both came back normal. They did not do a covid test. She then went to her regular Dr. on 6/15/21 and he gave her topiramate. He did not do a covid test. She was off work for a week and returned to work on 6/18/21. She is feeling better now and has worked for the last two days. She came to pharmacy and told me what was happening and she thinks that her symptoms are from the original J and J covid vaccine on 3/7/21 and she is worried that she may have recurring symptoms for the vaccine

                                                In the evening I started to feel aches in my eyes and joints.  I was having trouble falling asleep.  I woke up every 2 hours. My heart bpm went up to 102 in the middle of the night.  I know this because my fit bit was vibrating and encouraging me to keep exercising and I was just laying in bed trying to sleep.  I finally got up around 2:30 in the morning and took 1 Aleve. I also took my temperature with a forehead type and it was 98.5, so no high fever.  I took another Aleve around 7:00 in the morning.  Now I am feeling fine.  It&#39;s now 8:22 a.m. and I am working from home.  I just wanted to report that the aches in joints and 102 bpm and unable to fall asleep were my side effects.  I feel fine now.  I will continue to take Aleve as needed.   I have never been tested for Covid.  I have never had any symptoms to warrant testing for covid.  Since March 13, 2020 I have been fortunate to work for a company that has us all working from home.  We are still working from home.  i am 63 years old.  I shop around 6 a.m. in the morning for groceries to avoid people. I do not go out.  I have been very careful.

I woke up the next morning with a headache, chills, runny nose, fatigue, and nausea.  I took an allergy medication and stayed in bed.  This lasted all day.  I woke up the next day feeling fine, except for the constant runny  nose.  Also, on that day, I started having &#34;floaters&#34; in my left eye that I never had before (probably unrelated but I want to let you know).

                                                Approximately an hour and a half after getting the vaccine, I noticed my hands swelling, then my jaws started aching, then they felt like they were swelling, along with my cheeks going down my neck, then I got a great deal of pressure, swelling, in my ear drums. I was speaking with a friend, who is a nurse, and she told me to take a Benedryl, so I ate a 12.5 milligrams children&#39;s chewable diphenhydramine.  Twenty minutes later I felt normal again.  Later that evening I noticed the palms of my hands were very hot.  I did not have any fever.  That passed the next evening.

                                                March 13, 2021-1:30pm-Shot administered to right arm-it bled and the nurse had to apply pressure with an alcohol swab. It stopped immediately. 1:40-started feeling a tightness in the muscle in my neck under my right ear Stayed a few minutes longer than the required 15 to see if anything else presented. Mentioned it to the nurse and rep. The rep asked if I was nervous about getting the shot. When I said yes, he said it may just be that. Told me to contact my doctor with additional issues.  1:55-When leaving the parking lot, I felt my lips and nostril on the right side go numb-it felt like when Novocain is wearing off after a dentist visit. As the day progressed, the area under my ear and down my neck got more and more sensitive. My lips continued to feel numb. My injection site was tender and black and blue. When I went to bed at 9pm, I began experiencing lots of pain in my right lower jaw. I took a Tylenol but it didn&#39;t alleviate the pain. I called on-call doctor. Since I already had taken a Tylenol, he suggested an anti-inflammatory and warm moist compresses and to contact him again if things worsened. 3/14/21-7:00am-Upon awaking, my jaw pain was virtually gone but the whole area I had had the issue with was very tender to the touch. My lip still felt a bit numb.  3:25pm- It is now 26 hours since my vaccination. I still feel like I had trauma to the right side of my face and neck because it is sensitive to the touch. I also have a continued slight sensitivity of my lips on the right side. My glands on both sides of my neck now seem tender, as well. 3/15/21-3/17/21-I continue to have random pain/tenderness in the aforementioned areas. I also have an aura of tingling in my brain from time to time.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported.  The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included seasonal allergies, and codeine allergy. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1802068, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 05-MAR-2021 to left arm as prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 06-MAR-2021, after vaccination, she felt fine all day and night. The next morning she woke up and felt sick. She had nausea, headache, hive under eye. She laid back down and tried to sleep. A few hours later, she woke up to use the bathroom. She was very nauseous and dizzy. She lost consciousness and fell trying to get to the bathroom. She fell on her bed and was uninjured. The paramedics took her to the hospital. She was given medication for nausea, headache, and IV fluids. She gave blood for lab tests and they came back normal. No COVID test was administered. When she felt better, she was released. A few days later, she discovered her tongue was sore and red. She called her primary care physician (PCP). PCP said the red and sore tongue was probably related to allergies. Two weeks later, her tongue was not sore, but still red. They advised her to get a second opinion with another HCP. She was going to visit her allergy specialist.. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea, fatigue, inflammation on left eye, and small hives under eye on MAR-2021, and vomiting on 07-MAR-2021, and had not recovered from canker sore under tongue, and the outcome of fall on bed was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged).  Additional information was received from the patient on 23-Mar-2021. The following information was updated and incorporated into case narrative: Patient&#39;s medical history added as seasonal allergies and codeine allergy, Vaccination site as left arm added; Additional events as small hives under eye, fall on bed; lab test of blood work added; Event outcome of loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea, and fatigue was updated to recovered/resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: v1: Follow up information received updates  patient&#39;s medical history (seasonal allergies and codeine allergy), Vaccination site as left arm; Additional events (small hives under eye and fall on bed), laboratory test (Blood Work); Event outcome  (loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea and fatigue was updated to recovered/resolved). This updated information does not alter prior causality assessment of reported events 20210323730-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S-headache, nausea and fatigue. These events are labeled and are therefore considered potentially related. 20210323730-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S-loss of consciousness, fainted, heart racing, dizzy, vomiting, canker sore under tongue. These events are considered unassessable. The events have a compatible/suggestive temporal relationship, are unlabeled, and have unknown scientific plausibility. There are no information on any other factors potentially associated with the events.

                                                My symptoms started 03-18-2021 at 11am where I developed chills, was very sleepy that I slept 15 hours straight. I felt very fatigued and my eyes hurt so much and I could not keep them open. On 04-06-2021 I still was not feeling well. I started to have problems with my right side of my face, eyes and mouth which gradually got worse so I went to the hospital. At the hospital they checked me for stroke, performed lab work, did MRI and CT scans and the  the doctors came back and said it was Bell&#39;s palsy. I again went to the hospital 04-11-2021 but this time due to GI issues with pain.  On 04-14-2021 through 04-15-2021, I started to experience neck pain behind my right ear. At the hospital they had prescribed my prednisone 50mg, so I took half for my pain.  I still have trouble sleeping and have lots of pain.

The pain in mouth would come and go and responded to heat pack and extra strength Tylenol.   I also had a headache on the left side of my head.   The black eye went away in about three days.  The mouth pain went on off and on for about 7 days gradually subsiding in intensity over that time frame.  The headache only lasted for a few days.  I also felt some pressure behind my left eye.

This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: v0 This report involves a patient who experienced sinus inflammation, sensation of pressure in ear, injection site lump, chills, felt ill, injection site pain and fatigue next day after receiving Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Ad26.COV2.S for prophylactic vaccination. Approximately a week later, the patient experienced stomach cramps and diarrhea and 1.5 weeks later she had foggy feeling in head and &#34;believes the vaccine is contaminated&#34;, had fever blister, facial pain and vertigo. Approximately 3.5 weeks after being vaccinated the patient experienced pressure choking and difficulty swallowing. A throat (ENT) specialist was unable to diagnose and they felt there was some autoimmune effects. A month after being vaccinated the patient experienced stomach burning sensation, night sweats and tooth pain. Given the close temporal relationship and the nature of the events, the events of sinus inflammation, sensation of pressure in ear, injection site lump, chills, felt ill, injection site pain and fatigue are considered related to the vaccination. The insufficient information precludes a meaningful medical assessment of the remaining events, including &#34;autoimmune effects&#34;. The events will be assessed further when additional information is received.

That night of the shot, I had a headache - (Like a bus hit me) at 07:00 PM. The headache never went away after that. 24 hours later, I had a full body itch - I took Benadryl for that and that helped the rash. Since that first headache - I have had headaches every day. I have had to manage it with Tylenol and Ibuprofen and I still do. I saw my doctor 2 weeks after vaccine. My vision was going blurry about two weeks after my vaccine is when I really noticed it. My doctor sent me to an Ophthalmologist - I was told I had cataracts. I had my regular Optometrist - in January 2020 and nothing was noticed with cataracts. The doctor told me to try to manage the headaches and if I have any extreme pain then to go straight to ER.

                                                I now have mini little eczema patches on my face - two or three of them; I use Fluticasone (steroid) on them which I was using for the original adverse event with  red patches on/below my neck. I had a health report today primarily related to a different health issue but I asked her if I should use the Fluticasone cream on them. She cautioned me to use the steroid cream minimally on my face. The eczema I have on my hand - that is what I always there in dry, bad weather -  seems worse than it normally gets. The rash on my neck is gone. Also, two weeks after the Vaccine, I have noticed that my eye sight is different. I am going to the eye doctor tomorrow because of this.

                                                As soon as I got the shot, I immediately had a metallic taste in my mouth. I had a weird sensation in my nerves in my right arm and a little all over my body. I think the shot may have hit a nerve in my arm. Two weeks after the shot I was very pale, and my stomach was very upset. I had a headache and abdominal pain. I felt very ill so I didn&#39;t eat or drink much that day.  The smell of food made me throw up and felt really bad for 24 hours. I did not eat much for three days and it helped my nausea and I recovered after four days I still had the unusual feeling all over my body. I got some IV therapy twice and it helped. It did start to fade over time and I finally started to feel normal after a month. I am fully recovered now.

Staying hydrated, but skin on lips sheeting off at times.  Also, using Chapstick.  This is not normal for me and I can only connect it with having received the vaccine.  I think the symptom is improving, but it very slow and minimal.  This started shortly after receiving the vaccine a month ago and continues to this day.  Other side effects were very temporary:  Headache, fatigue.  No arm soreness at all.  Mild body aches within 24 hours, but diminished rapidly.

                                                The injection did hurt quite a bit more than other injections I have had in the past but it began to feel better and I sat in a chair and was on my phone to send a message, spoke to a stranger who was looking for where to go, and was ok until the feeling of fainting began 10 minutes after the shot. I put my head between my knees but it did not help so I called for help and eventually was helped onto the floor to lie down which began to help. I had vision trouble and hearing trouble and could not speak. I was told my neck became bright red as my face grew white and my hands twitched and my eyes rolled around. I found out later that I had also peed my pants. I have fainted only once before in 1989, and found this reaction pretty frightening although I do not believe it happened as a result of anxiety or fear, the adverse effect itself was frightening and unexpected- not listed on any paperwork I received and was not aware it could occur.

                                                About 15 mins after injection my legs started itching, and I felt slightly disoriented, dizzy. I did feel like it wouldn&#39;t be smart to drive so my husband drove me home. I had a slight fever that night and next day, I felt super tired. I scheduled an ultrasound for 1 week following the shot, My ears kind of freaked out after the ultrasound and was itching and burning, I also got a rash around my neck after ultrasound. The rash felt like fire. Allegra helped with the itching. Faint rash traveled down my arms. The Dr. put me on prednisone the rash spread to my back and upper legs. Benadryl was not helpful. It lasted approximately 2 weeks.

There was drainage down my throat from runny nose. Feeling really weak and tired. Really deep down in my lungs cough. I was sick for about five days and then went to Urgent Care; Cough medicine and Z-Pak Antibiotic that helped with all except the water in my ears. That hasn&#39;t gone away yet so my hearing is a little off.  The cough lasted for about two and 1/2 weeks but is gone now. I cough every once in a while, but not bad. I may go back to the Urgent care for my ears.

The muscle is still affected and strained after 6 days. I waited a half hour at the site and got into my car at 3:45. On the drive home within 30 minutes my face started to itch and turn red, then my mouth inside started to itch, then my eyes started to itch. After that my throat started to feel gravely, so I took 75 mgs of gel cap benedryl. This is what I feel and take upon getting stung by a bee. I also took my albuterol inhaller two puffs which I also always have on me because of my asthma. I was sleepy but had dinner and went to be. I did not feel that I had to take more benedryl during the night.

Hives in the crook of my right arm. Burning, itchy little red bumps. I couldn&#39;t swallow but I think that was from the high blood sugar as my mouth was very dry.

Entire body became hot and had to fan myself (not a hot flash) Approximately 45 minutes later left ear started tingling and then pain followed and only in left ear. An hour after the shot ( and back home) started feeling tingling in lips and face. Face swelled up and smoothed out wrinkles. Lasted about 2 hours and then subsided.  Also metallic taste in mouth during swelling of the face. Metallic taste lasted as long as the face swelling which was about 2 hours. Loose stools and tummy upset which is still going on.

I also perceive that my breath and hands have this same smell. I had a mild case of Covid-19 in December 2020 and did not have these symptoms at that time. I had typical reactions to the vaccine for the 2 days after injection - fever, headache - but the impact on senses took some time to kick in. Those impacts have persisted, at least as of today.

                                                Immediately after the shot, I felt dizzy and started to sweat throughout my body including my hands.  I waited more than 40 minutes to see if improved but it was exactly the same. Didn&#39;t get better or worse. I did not report it immediately because it was not alarming and I did not feel bad. It was just my head that was spinning a little bit and sweating. After waiting more than 45 minutes I decided to drive home because the dizziness was not that strong. I would say it was like a 45% dizzyness if I have to calculate how I felt. The sweating passed after 4 hours and at soon as I arrived home I went to bed and relax. It is now 6:08 pm and the dizziness has improved considerably. I would calculate now about 10% of that vertigo feeling. It is getting better and better. I just wanted to point out that in no time I was feeling bad. Everything was just in my hearing labyrinth internal with balance. I also felt 20 minutes of echoing in my ears about 2 hours ago.

                                                On the morning of March 15, I developed  a red rash on throat, lower facial cheeks, and chin.  Lips tingled a little bit.  Rash did not itch.   Took 2 Benadryl three times that day, contacted doctor via email.   The rash was better the next day (March 16) but took 2 Benadryl again three times that day.   Sent photo to doctor who had an allergist in the clinic look.  He said it was a reaction to the vaccine.    March 17 rash was completely gone and have had no other reactions since.

                                                Metallic taste in mouth 30 minutes after receiving vaccine. I have had a lot of stress (significant other diagnosed with Stage 4 inoperable NSCLC ) and had been attributing the often present headache to that, but they were also accompanied by a butterfly pattern red flush across my nose.  Acid reflux which I was attributing to stress or alendronate.  Woke in the night 4/12 to severe acid reflux, nausea, headache, flush, thought maybe I was having a heart attack (I have no cardiac/BP issues); then last night, 4/14 about 6 PM, weird numbness tingling in right arm from center of my chest  passed in about 5 minutes. Significant Other said I had the pattern flush on face at time of attack which faded as I began to feel better.  I have not consistently felt at 100% since vaccination, but I have a lot going on and attributed it to that.

                                                For the 1st 10 days it felt like my brain was swollen too big for my skull.  Not like any headache I have ever had.  I did take some acetaminophen but it didn?t seem to quell the pain.  While still at vaccine site I got a weird taste in my mouth, dry mouth and my voice started going hoarse.  I stayed a while longer to be watched as I also had itching.  I did not go into hives.  I had pain in my body from time of injection ? the ?typical? sore arm didn?t set in until day 3-4.  I had hot spots all over my body ? but not fever or rash.   On 4/11/21 I broke out into a rash on my forehead that lasted about 4 days.  What I want to specifically report is I like these zinger/sharp traveling pain from my temples to posterior head.  Still having this sensation but not as frequently.  They don?t last long but are noticeable at the time they are happening.  The only way I can explain the pain is that it felt like when you break a blood vessel in you finger and it really, really hurts for a short while and then pain subsides.  I started having these pin prick sensations within the first few days all over my body (arms, legs, back) but the frequency has decreased.  Days 2-6 I was just wiped out and rested.  I am still feeling lack of energy still today.

                                                Exactly a week after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine, I was out on my morning walk when my head became very fuzzy and my vision was altered (seeing jagged zigzags-fuzzy ones with my left eye).  The vision issue persisted when I closed my eyes.  The fuzzy head issue continued during a very difficult walk home and when I arrived and things didn&#39;t clear, my husband ended up taking me to the emergency room.  I got in quickly because the symptoms I described sounded to them like a stroke.  But, I didn&#39;t have a stroke.  They did a CT scan.  It was fine.  The vision thing they thought sounded like the effect of a migraine.  But, I&#39;ve never experienced migraines.  (Note: this incident occurred the day before the news of the J&amp;J blood clots became public).  Anyway, after a couple of hours in the emergency room, I was fine and went home.  So, I don&#39;t know what happened and it probably didn&#39;t have anything to do with the vaccine.  I&#39;m not prone to being alarmist and I would only consent to go to the emergency room if I thought I were in a serious situation.  The blood work indicated my platelets were in the normal range.  And, I&#39;m too old to be in the category of the six women who experienced blood clots.  However, I just thought I should report this in case anyone else experiences something similar.

She stated that her sister received the J and J vaccine on 3/12/21 (confirmed in State vaccine system) at the hospital where she receives her oncology care.  She reported the following:  &#34;She had a massive stroke on MARCH 27TH, 2021 leaving her paralyzed on the right side with the inability to speak, swallow, or see. She was initially diagnosed with Ovarian cancer approximately three and one half years ago. She was chosen for a study with Pharmaceuticals and her diagnosis was changed to a vary rare form of cancer called clear cell carcinoma which originates in the gynecological area. She did have a previous stroke approximately three years ago, (just after original diagnosis) but she was on a different course of treatment at that time...Oncologists have explained that this most recent stroke event would not be considered a side effect of her current treatment routine. She wanted to bring it to the attention of the health department in case it needs to be looked at more closely by the J&amp;J research/scientific team. She passed away on 4/5/21. Her current treatment consisted of palliative chemo only. &#34;  Decedent was a resident but was vaccinated in another state. After the CVA she was brought to the hospital and subsequently transferred to the Medical Center where she died on 4/5/2021. Sister is willing to speak with any investigators if deemed necessary.

                                                Two weeks after the vaccine I noticed that I had a strange feeling in my eye. When I looked in the mirror I saw a little line of blood. I went to the ER and after examining my eye they could not find reason for the blood in my eye. I was told it was a Hyphema. The following day I felt pressure in my eye which lasted for one day. I went to the Optometrist a week later but the blood was no longer visible. The doctor could not find anything wrong.

                                                I tested positive for Covid-19 with no severe symptoms in February of 2021. One week after the vaccine on 04/09/2021 I broke out in hives after eating a meal. The hives were mostly on the right side of my body but there were some on the left. I also had some numbness and tingling in my mouth. I used some anti itch cream, and the hives were mostly gone the next day. Twelve days after the vaccine I started to unusual vision symptoms which included wavy zig-zag lines in my vision. My doctor advised that they were Ocular Migraines. I had a headache at the same time, but I have never had Migraines before. I was also fatigued with a little dizzy and nauseous. The headache lasted for one day, but I still felt a little nauseous the next day. The feeling of fatigue and tired ness lasted for about six weeks. Two to three days after Ocular Migraines I started to notice a bright red rash on the right side of my back. It quickly spread around my side to the midline and then up my right side to my Bra line in front. I consulted my doctor on 04/19/2021 and he identified the rash as Shingles I was prescribed Acyclovir 800mg for 7 days and then an additional 5 days. I saw my Dermatologist on 05/06/2021 and he said that the Shingles were still active so I was Prescribed Valacyclovir. The Shingles lasted about six weeks total with some fatigue before I felt normal. I still have some visible signs of the rash on my back.

Then she got petechia in both legs and she took it easy, drank a lot of water.  She took it easy, but ever since then her energy is not there, she is &#34;zapped&#34;.  She has changed her whole routine, she is pretty active and now she cannot do much due to the fatigue.  She is now really concerned as it is lasting.  She feels like she is mentally confused.  She could not tell me her address without looking it up first.  It has started to subside some the feeling of being off.  She feels like that she has no blood in her.  She feels like she&#39;s out of iron, and zapped of energy.   She has not called her doctor.

                                                I have developed tinnitus and am experiencing hearing loss. It is sometimes very intense and sometimes mild but 2 months out still a problem.

                                                Six hours after the vaccine I got chills, headache, stomach upset and swelling in my lower face and throat. I had body aches all over my body but no fever or pain at the injection site. Those symptoms lasted for ten days. I went to ER. I was given medication for the nausea and pain. The chills were a little better by then. The medication helped with everything but the headache. The headache is constant at the back right of my head. I then get other head pain at the same time in my temples on the left. It is a sharp shooting pain. I get flashes of light in my eyes and my eyes start twitching at the sides. I also get pain at the top of my head on the left hand side on occasionally which comes after the temple pain. I sometimes get head pain on the right side with deep concentration. I have recently started to get tremors in my right hand. Sometimes the headache wakes me up at night. I wake up every day with a headache and it has been thirteen weeks. I can not drive or concentrate. I have seen a neurologist but I am still having trouble scheduling scans. I have tried some prescription pain medication and it did not work. I have taken two courses of steroids.

                                                VIRAL PINK EYE Monday 3/15 AM I received the  vaccine. That night I had some mild achiness and headache which continued the next day. Nothing exceptional. The next morning, Wednesday, when I woke up I was surprised that my right eye was a bit crusty. It was rather red but not painful. I thought it would go away ignored it but that night I realized it was still red.  I did some research about pink eye and realized I fit the description for viral pink eye.  But when I saw that 90% of all viral pink eye is caused by the Adenovirus - the same that is used in the vaccine I realized I should report the coincidence. I made an appointment with my doctor to confirm before submitting this report.

                                                Patient reported that she experienced blurry vision one day after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, around 2:00 pm on 3/17/2021. She expressed concern that this might be related to the COVID-19 vaccine. She said it feels like there&#39;s something in her eye that&#39;s irritating it. I asked if she has seasonal allergies, and she said yes. She does not take anything for allergies. I advised her to try Visine eye drops. After consulting with Dr, I also advised her to take an over the counter antihistamine like Zyrtec, Allegra, or Claritin. Patient is diabetic, so we asked her to check her blood glucose as well. Patient reports that the Visine helped. Her blood sugar was 189. She reported chills and a mild fever. She took Tylenol and it brought her temperature down to of 99.6 F. I advised her to call me if any of her symptoms get worse or do not improve.

                                                On Sat. 3-13-2021 at 11:53am, Janssen covid shot was administered in left arm.  Approximately 3 hours later, at about 3:10pm, I started seeing bright flashing arcs of light in my upper left vision.  I wondered if these were precursors of a migraine coming, but mine normally are crackles of primary colors in the center of my vision.  I remembered the vitreous detachment in my right eye 5 years ago.  This seemed similar, but not very similar.  Around 6pm I noticed a largish donut in my left eye vision, which I&#39;ve never seen before.  About 7:30pm I called the consulting nurse, who told me to go to Urgent Care.  Got there about 8pm.  The MD thought it was a vitreous detachment, but wanted to get an OD on the phone. Additional floaters appeared in my left eye vision while I waited.  OD via phone thought it was a vitreous detachment and set up an appointment to see me on Mon. 3-15-2021.  Flashing arcs/donut/floaters continued through the next day.  Last flashing arcs were about noon on Mon. 3-15-2021.  In total the flashing arcs lasted about 45 hours.  5 years ago, in the right eye, flashing lights lasted only 5-10 minutes. On Mon. 3-15-2021 had eye exam. OD said posterior vitreous detachment (PVD).  Wanted second opinion about my retina.  Second OD performed exam, agreed on PVD and that my retina looked okay. On Fri. 4-2-2021 had follow-up exam with same OD.  Retina looked good.  Floaters are diminishing. What terrible timing if this was a coincidence.  It made everything post-covid-shot very confusing.

I had to miss 6 days of work because I was too sick to teach.

                                                About 4 and a half weeks after getting the J&amp;J vaccine, I began to experience marked symptoms: dizziness and disorientation,, balance problems, bilateral numbness in hands, feet and tip of tongue, awareness of left side of brain, intermittent mild nausea (likely related to dizziness).  These symptoms had a sudden onset. I am normally very healthy and active so these unusual symptoms without any illness were quite a departure from my normal health. They have, to date, persisted continually since onset over the past 3 weeks. They are very concerning. Last night I went to the ER to be seen since I could not get an appt. with a neurologist for several months and I am concerned about my sudden change in health status.

                                                On the way home I had neurological symptoms, tongue and lip tingling, nauseated. The smell of Lysol spray made me not be able to breath.  Made me dizzy and nauseous. It was like an LSD trip. It like being on a roller coaster, It continued all the way home. I could see all the timbers and bright green colors. Neck was stiff and it crawled up my head to my temples. It was like someone was holding my head. About 3 days later after vaccine my throat started to close and we headed to ER. I took turmeric and ginger to the ER as well as Benadryl.  The symptoms subsided before we reached ER so I didn&#39;t  seek care. I took vitamin E and fish oil  2X everyday after vaccine for 10 days following vaccine.

Metallic taste went to gums, and I could feel the metal taste scallop across my teeth, from left to right.  Felt a sweaty sensation on top of head, like I had a bowl on top of my head.  Metallic taste started going down my throat.  Soft palate swollen causing gagging due to uvula touching my tongue.  Could feel the sensation on my head inching its way down my head.  It stopped at the hairline  above my ears, which made me think that I was getting in feeling in my hair follicles and not a sweaty sensation.  Stayed 70 minutes at site.  Metallic taste mostly gone.  I was told to pick up some Benedryl.  As soon as I took it I felt a strong pounding in my ears.  When eating dinner I could feel a slight constriction while swallowing.  The next morning  the lymph nodes in my armpits were extremely sore.  Neck lymph nodes stopped being sore Saturday, but are still a little swollen.  Lymph nodes in arm pits were better on Sunday, but are still sore if pushed on.

Later at night I had a low grade fever with achiness and headache. The flu like symptoms resolved by morning but I continue to have vertigo and intermittent nausea and my BP was still high in the morning around 9 am but came down by 12:45 to my normal range.  Paramedics at the site did a BP, pulse ox, blood sugar, ECG . Everything was normal except my BP which was 180/90.  This morning it was 167/98 and 168/97.  No treatment.  Saw my doctor&#39;s partner at 1:00 today and BP was back to my normal range but I still have mild vertigo and intermittent nausea.  Doc gave me some exercises to do for the vertigo and did not seem to think that it was related to the shot, but since the paramedics said they had seen a LOT of the same reaction yesterday to the J&amp;J shot and two sites in other cities shut down for the same reactions, nobody will convince me that it was anything but the shot. I expected the flu like side effects but never dreamed it would cause my  BP to spike and the vertigo.

                                                The patient is a 66 y.o. female with past history of diabetes, GERD and HTN who presents to the Emergency Department with visual changes of the right eye and associated pain to the face and neck. Per interpretor, patient woke up feeling at baseline yesterday morning, when she had her COVID-19 vaccine. Yesterday around dinner time, she began having issues with vision in her right eye, causing her visual field in that eye to appear dark to her entire right eye. She told her husband that she thought she might have a hair or eyelash in her right eye and that she had an irritating pain radiating from her right eye to the right side of her face. Even after washing her eye with cold water, the sensation did not subside. At approximately 3-4 AM this morning, she also began to experience pain to the back of her head and neck bilaterally. This morning, the visual impairment improved from the entire visual field to now only just the inferior aspect of the right eye. However, she denies weakness to any of her extremities. Patient also denies chest pain, numbness, abdominal pain or nausea. She was seen at ophthalmology, at which Dr. diagnosed her with a right retinal branch arterial occlusion and decided to send her to SHE to be evaluated for the possibility of a CVA. She denies being on blood thinners or taking Aspirin. She denies any previous diagnosis of a CVA or TIA.

                                                I can&#39;t say for sure but 9 days after receiving the vaccine, my condition called Erythromelalgia flared up terribly, which involved uncomfortable to intense burning of the outer ears 24/7 with no relief.  It calmed down for a couple of days and then came back with other symptoms, including the burning ears, and parts of my neck and face.  In addition to that, my eyes were bloodshot and had drainage coming from them and in the morning, it appeared that they had like a lining of film over them.  Skin is peeling due to all the burning in the areas described.  Several different treatments were tried but none has slowed down the flare-up.  After another trip back to the NP, she said that it was inflamation and gave me a steroid shot along with prednisone tablets.  I also went to an optometrist who found some things wrong with my eyes and prescribed some steroid eye drops.  Before the vaccine, we pretty much had the Erythromelalgia under control with meds but this time, it&#39;s been hard to get things under control and more tolerable.

                                                I had a horrible migraine. After I described it to my Ophthalmologist, Dr. , he said he didn&#39;t believe it to be a typical migraine. I had vision disturbance in my right eye for about 2 weeks. After one week, I called my doctor. I&#39;m not sure if it has cleared up or my brain has become used to it. I had a MRI and I followed up with a Neurosurgeon and he said I have a small brain tumor (meningioma), but it was not a part of the problem. I think that if the Janssen Vaccine hadn&#39;t been paused around the time I had my migraine, I wouldn&#39;t have been so alarmed and worried.

                                                15-20 minutes after the injection, I started feeling a tightness in back of my throat; I broke out in cold sweat. I started getting dizzy and very whoozy. I felt my vision starting to close in. I thought I was going to pass out. I got the attention of the person across me to get an attendant and they brought me a chair with wheels. Two people got me up (and I&#39;m not a big person) - they were worried I was going down and I was taken to exam room. They said I was white as a sheet. She checked my eyes and throat a few times and checked my blood pressure. It was lower than normal but she didn&#39;t seem really concerned about it - 104 over 60 something which is low for me. She gave me water to sip. She gave me very cold compresses to put on my forehead. They watched me pretty good. She had the epi-pen ready. She watched me and I sat in there and nurse came in a quite a few times to check me for about an hour. About an hour later the tightness went away and I started feeling myself again. We went home. I went to sleep. I woke up at night to go to bathroom and I was still a little woozy but I didn&#39;t fall. Next day, I just didn&#39;t feel well. My left arm was starting to hurt - was no swelling; it was a little red at injection site. It hurt just a little. I was woozy. My eyes couldn&#39;t focus as well. I felt out of it. I drank a lot of water and took a nap.  Yesterday, I felt pretty decent but still woozy somewhat. I tried to run errands with my husband  - just wasn&#39;t quite right. Today, much better but I&#39;m not quite myself yet. Just a little wooziness - weird feeling. Yesterday, I did feel a soreness in the back of my right calf muscle. It wasn&#39;t warm to the touch or swollen. I don&#39;t have it anymore, it went away.  It could have been a muscle thing from the first day of the vaccine when I got home and I got up and almost fell down. I do still have some achiness in joints. Especially in my knees - which isn&#39;t normal because they are replaced.

The next morning I woke up, I felt like I got hit by a truck, I felt so bad, no chest and body hurt. I got up and did a breathing treatment. I went to the Dr. because it sacred me, she gave me antibiotics , cough medicine with codeine- I couldn&#39;t stop coughing.  I asked her to change my nebulizer treatment because it wasn&#39;t working.  The Dr. suspected that this would happen.

My heart rate stayed at 109 or more until 10 PM the next night when its slowly went down to a normal heart rate.  At 3 am  (12 hours after the shot) i had  a blinding debilitating headache that lasted until 9pm the next night.   It also affected my vision.   The headache was so bad i could not concentrate on the simplest task.  I  was unsure of what i could take for the headache.   So, I did not take anything.    When i woke up i was very tired and this lasted until the following day.  6am i had a fever of 102.3 this went down to 100.4 at 9:15 pm that night.  I also had chills for several hours. 9:20 AM  the nausea started followed by vomiting and dizziness.   This only lasted for a few hours.    I  experienced very vivid dreams the night of the shot.    I only drank some coconut water all day and could not eat any food.  The next day Saturday March 27 i felt better but the fatigue did not go away until late in the evening.   Sleeping seemed to help but i could only sleep for 2- 3 hours at the most.

My eyes swelled and they started to tear up, I felt weak all day and into the evening. I never had a bad reaction to a vaccine before, so this was surprising.  I contacted the health department as they came to my house and gave me the shot, but I could not get through to anyone. I had to leave a message. After I was contacted back, I was told that someone would contact me that very same day, but no one ever did that day or any other day. .Because of that, I thought it must not have been a big deal, but after reading today that people in a specific had some of the same reactions I did, I thought I should report it.

On April 5th started with a couple of days with severe pain in tendons of right shoulder. The pain referred into the right neck and base of occiput. On April 7, 2021, I felt off then developed a severe, stabbing headache over my right eye referring back into the occiput.  Was not steady on my feet. Did not eat dinner, went to bed.  Felt tingling around my mouth, and my neck and shoulders were very tight.  I debated about going to the hospital, but decided against it.  Still have tightness on the right side of my neck into the occiput and right shoulder.

She went to her eye doctor and he stated she had an &#34;eye stroke&#34;.  She had injections in her eye today.  I asked her to please call her primary physician as well and she agreed.

                                                Jansen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the vaccination on 3/12/2021, about 8:30AM, at Fairgrounds. I needed the J&amp;J vaccine, one Moderna or Pfizer as I have a history of anaphylaxis. County Public Health received about 200 does of the J&amp;J and 800 of Moderna and Pfizer.   I waited at the vaccine site about 40 minutes after the vaccine. I went home, ate, read, and became unusually sleepy so took a nap. I woke up about 2:00PM and noticed my lips and tongue were swollen, and sore. I took 2 Benadryl. The Benadryl seems to have worked as expected. I will take 2 more when I go to bed, about 11:00.  I&#39;m unusually sleepy, and my joints ache. Overall, however, I think I am experiencing a very mild reaction and I&#39;m thankful for the vaccine. I sent my doctor a message through the patient portal, telling him of the reaction. His office is closed so he will get the message on Monday.

I have had this reaction before with exposure to wet polyurethane.  The doctor looked at my leg to see if if there was a rash (there was not) and she gave me a bendryl.  The symptoms subsided.  I stayed at the clinic for a total of 2 hours.  Later that evening, the itching came back so I gave myself one benedryl and the itching subsided.  The following morning the itching was gone and my tongue felt better.

I have had mild tinnitus for several years, generally not noticeable except in extremely quiet settings. But 2 days after receiving J&amp;J vaccine - (the day on which I felt the most &#34;fatigued&#34; and experienced some muscle aches, which responded well to ibuprofen) - I awoke with several episodes of loud ringing in my ears.  From that time until now, my continuous tinnitus is much louder than it had been.  I keep hoping it will subside!  It&#39;s more frustrating and annoying than anything else. No pain or discomfort. For this reason I have held off seeking medical treatment.  It seems like more than a coincidence to me, so I felt I should probably at least try to report it.

                                                Approximately an hour after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine, I noticed a loud constant ringing in my ears (tinnitus) which has continued. I still heard the ringing in my ears on April 8.  The ringing was so loud on April 9, that it woke me up during my sleep. The morning of Saturday, April 10, I called insurance company Advice Nurse and was advised to go to an Urgent Care to discuss my symptoms. with a doctor who checked my ears and blood pressure--both look normal. He also recommended going to an ENT, for which I have set up a future appointment. Last night, I slept better, but still hear the ringing in my ears this morning. I am very concerned about this ongoing side-effect.

                                                Headaches began Monday after vaccine. Burning on outside of brain 2 days. Headaches became severe head pain which moved around. Several times ice pick like feeling in stomach. Felt like brain was shaking or vibrating. That lasted almost two weeks. At the end of that time electrical shocks firing randomly throughout my brain.  Severe fatigue daily. Had to fall into bed and sleep for three hours daily during the severe symptoms. Now headaches daily but pain much less. Mostly on left side of head and behind left eye. Lesser fatigue but still there. Has affected quality of life.

                                                Johnson and Johnson Janssen COVID-19 EUA vaccine  At the time of the injection, the vaccine burned as it entered my arm. (I have never felt that burning sensation with any other vaccination that I have had in the past. Twenty minutes after the vaccination, I became lightheaded and dizzy.  I could walk but I was wobbly. At one hour after the vaccination, I felt a sharp stabbing pain in the left side of my tongue and then the left side and only the left side of my tongue began to go numb. Within a couple of minutes, I realized that my left jaw was going numb, too.  The numbness slowly but surely began to move up the left side of my face all the way to the top of my head.  I had a sharp but brief headache on the left side of my head  that subsided quickly but the numbness remained.  I went home and talked to two people on the phone for several hours because they wanted to be sure that I was OK. At two hours after the vaccination, my face was still numb but I could think and talk clearly, but I was clearing my throat and coughing a lot.  At that point, I also realized that my whole left arm was a little numb and my fingers on my left hand were tingling.  That numbness lasted about 20 minutes and then subsided. The facial numbness lasted for hours.  I wasn&#39;t scared and I wasn&#39;t in pain but it was very strange.  It felt a little bit like the after affects of dental anesthesia but it wasn&#39;t just in my mouth it was the whole left side of my face.   I believe that this must have been an allergic reaction to one of the chemicals in the vaccine but I don&#39;t know which one.  If you can tell me which chemical it might have been, I will avoid it in the future.

Not a headache sufferer, so felt like getting a cold or maybe sinus issue. Ears feel like a &#34;roaring&#34; at times, no ache or anything else, just noise (started days after head) Intermittent not being able to taste food (noticed last week) Smelling is noticeably off (noticed last week)  Had just passed it off as generally thinking I was getting a cold, but today made French toast with cinnamon, and could not taste that it even had cinnamon in it. I usually have an acute sense of smell &amp; taste

                                                Patient is a 69-year-old female who reports a history of hayfever who is coming in today after recent Covid vaccination with concerns of facial swelling also complaining of the rash and itching to her chest.  On exam the patient has obvious facial swelling.  She has what appears to be an urticarial rash on her chest.  While she does have swelling around her lips and face otherwise she does not appear to have any obvious signs of airway involvement with no swelling of her tongue or uvula, she has good phonation with normal respirations without difficulty.  Does not appear to be having reactive airway disease exacerbation at this time.  Does not appear to have impending respiratory distress.  She otherwise does have some skin changes in her bilateral lower extremities that she reports is baseline with her history of eczema.  Primary concern at this time is for possible allergic reaction.  Patient appears to have angioedema.  Does not appear to have anaphylaxis.  Other abnormalities are considered.  Patient will be connected to cardiac and respiratory monitors.  IV access will be obtained.  The patient will be given a 1 L IV fluid bolus.  She will be given Benadryl, Solu-Medrol, and famotidine.  Patient be monitored for response.  Labs have been ordered to evaluate.  EKG as well as chest x-ray will be obtained.  We will file VARES report.   Chest x-ray obtained.  There is no acute cardiac no acute pulmonary pathology on my interpretation.  Laboratory evaluation has returned.  The patient&#39;s CBC is reassuring.  CMP shows a glucose of 78, otherwise reassuring without significant abnormality.  Troponin within normal limits.  Covid, influenza, RSV testing is negative.  On repeat evaluation the patient is resting comfortably.  She reports that the itching has resolved.  Her face feels less uncomfortable.  She has had no progression of the swelling.  On repeat examination she continues to have facial swelling as well as swelling around her lips however she has no tongue swelling, no swelling within her posterior oropharynx, and her phonation continues to be normal.  She and her friend were informed of the initial findings.  Plan at this time is to admit for further evaluation and treatment.

                                                Approximately 21 days after receiving vaccine I started to have symptoms of what was later diagnosed to be shingles.  My skin was very sensitive to even wearing clothes and I thought I had bites on the back of my neck into my hairline because we had been on Nantucket.  But I could not see it.  I was feeling very fatigued and had pain from my left ear down my left arm and side.   I did not think it could be shingles because  I received the Shingrix vaccines in 2019.  Finally I had my husband take a picture of it and sent it to me PCP ON 4/8/2021.  She informed me it was shingles and put me on a prescription (not sure of name for 1 week).  Because nerve pain in neck and ear still continues I was prescribed Gabapentin which I am still taking.

                                                Intense UTI and urgency to urinate, no control of it. Fatigue/sleeping, brain confusion, aches, headaches everyday, old injuries became active again i.e. my broken hand 7 years ago began hurting and couldn&#39;t use it, my knee would not hold me up to stand and kept going out on me (from 2010 broken tibia and torn knee ligaments). Began a sinus infection, cough and eye pain with awful  bouts of constant sneezing. Third  round of antibiotics for the UTI and my bladder is still not right with leakage and urgency. Liver enzymes are high chart.

                                                Onset was 10 days after vaccination with a pressure-like headache and dizziness associated with constant loud tinnitus bilaterally.  She noted these symptoms for over 5 weeks, plus some right ear ache with occasional throbbing, amplification of some sounds, and some shooting pains in the head, plus insomnia.  Symptoms seemed to subside on about 5/21, perhaps helped by her avoidance of caffeine and alcohol.  There was a brief flare up the week of 5/19 after a meal of spicy food.  That same week she notice some shuffling of the left foot and apparent left leg weakness, without injury.

                                                1 week after vaccine, my right eye lid began twitching--like it would do occasionally if I spent too many hours on the computer. But unlike previous twitching which would twitch off and on for maybe an hour, this one continues to this day, 3 months since it began and it&#39;s pretty frequent, up to 20 twitches per hour sometimes. It also twitches when my eyes are closed.  Only thing different in my life/activities was that I had received the Covid vaccine.

                                                2 different events: 1) 20-30 minutes after the shot, I felt dizzy and disoriented, similar to car-sickness, but I wasn&#39;t in a moving vehicle; It appeared that the center of the field of vision for my left eye had become blurred. Subsequently, I had a bad headache and body aches, which lasted most of that day and the next day. My vision is still blurred. A visit to my optician on 13 April 2021 confirmed an epi-retinal membrane, which was not present at my previous eye exam.  2) about two weeks after the shot, I experienced severe pain and raised blood vessels in different areas of both my fore arms, hands and fingers, and my lower left leg and left foot. These lasted a few minutes and then subsided. They were severe enough to wake me up multiple times every night. I finally went to my doctor&#39;s office on April 26, saw the nurse practitioner who actually watched one of these episodes. She consulted Dr., they were only concerned about my left leg being a potential blood clot; said the other areas were unlikely to cause significant problems, sent me for an ultrasound examination of my left leg on April 27th, which showed no blood clot. The intermittent raised veins and pain continued for another week or so then subsided.

Throughout the day the swelling continued on the left side of face, then on bottom of right foot and later on top of both feet.  Went to emergency room and was treated for hives.  Over the next five days, the hives kept moving around, the right side of face, and then to upper lip.  I followed up with my Primary Care Doctor, who did extensive allergy testing.  All came back negative.  I felt that it was a result of my body reacting to the vaccine.  In addition, I was feeling weak muscles and joints that kept moving around.

                                                A day after the vaccination, I experience loud ringing in my ears. I have not had this condition before. I could also hear a pulse in my ears. The tinnitus has still not resolved 10 weeks after the vaccine. Also, I was lightheaded and dizzy and that has only subsided somewhat. 3 days after the vaccine, I had  very strong  veryeffects when I took Snythroid, my thyroid medication which I have taken for many years. This issue has persisted even though we have lowered my dose. This was not an issue prior to the vaccine.

                                                Patient reported J&amp;J COVID vaccine receipt on ?4/28. Symptoms of headache with visual disturbances and abdominal pain began less than 2 weeks later. She presented to the ED about 4 to 5 weeks after the vaccine with chest pain, abdominal pain, and hemoptysis.    Work up identified right sided central and bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli, with splanchnic circulation thrombosis of the upper segment of the superior mesenteric vein, splenic vein, main portal vein, and intrahepatic portal veins, as well as dural sinus thrombosis.  The patient was thrombocytopenic with elevated heparin pf4 antibody. She was initially started on heparin, but transitioned to argatroban and IVIG, with resultant increase in platelet counts over the course of her stay. She was also started on Diamox 250 BID for increased IOP.  The patient was hypoxic on room air, requiring up to 4L of oxygen during her stay, but was down to 1L at the time of discharge. She was discharged on rivaroxaban for continued anticoagulation.

                                                about two hours after injection,  I experienced headache,  then mild dizziness,  then extreme dizziness,  then sudden overwhelming fatigue,  then swollen eyes and eyelids,  then chills and elevated heart rate,  with pounding.    I had to cancel the class I was supposed to teach,  because I would not have been safe to drive to campus.  I slept from approximately 2:30 pm on March 8 until 8:30 am today,  March 9,   all symptoms continuing,  with bathroom breaks, a couple of short reports to family members who were watching out for me,  and one  2-hour window during which I ate a small meal,  went back to bed,  and read part of a book.    During bathroom breaks I took more antronex,  some milk thistle,  and some glutathione,  which seemed to at least temporarily reduce dizziness and eye/eyelid swelling.  At one point I took some hawthorne tincture because I was concerned about the heart pounding.    Today I woke up feeling symptom-free,  but by 2 pm I was compelled by sudden fatigue to take a two-hour nap.   After that I felt better,  and I think I am now fine,  at 7:45 pm on 3/9/21.    I am happy to have gotten the Janssen vaccine,  because it is one and done!

                                                Noon the day after the vaccine I was suddenly overcome with nausea, and dizziness that sent me stumbling to bed and vomiting into a bucket next to me. Vomiting lasted for one session, but dizziness and nausea stayed for about 3 hours, and then nausea, fatigue and general sick feeling kept me in bed until the next day. April 9 I woke up still feeling out of sorts, but not as bad. Note: 28 minutes after having the vaccine, once I started driving home, the vision in my left eye suddenly went blurry, and I nearly lost vision in that eye. I tried to find a safe place to pull over but couldn&#39;t. After 5-8 minutes the vision came back but stayed a bit blurry for a couple hours. Never had any such thing happen before.

                                                taste has changed, starting from 1st day of shot and ongoing. Salt is hard to detect and flavors of all foods have decreased.  No other expected side effects, just a slight 30 second wave of nausea 20 minutes after shot, and again the next day with a feeling of being a bit &#34;off&#34; for a day or two. Only the taste decrease seems to be ongoing and unexpected.

                                                I had a headache that bothered me I mean it hurt. Then I got diarrhea, sick on the stomach and real weak and watery mouth. Just didn&#39;t feel right, feverish, real thirsty almost like the flu and my body would ache, like going up and down the hill. For a while I was really totally upset and said I shouldn&#39;t have gotten the shot. All I wanted to do was lay down and I got so weak. I don&#39;t think I would take another shot again if they come out with a booster.

A month afterwards, I did have a couple days of extreme tiredness. Left eye blurriness and I changed my contact lens; but noticed there was double vision in the left eye- Ocular migraine - the optometrist thought it was like that. It lasted about five hours. During that time I did have blood test for Thyroid.

ED physician noted that he felt that this was a drug reaction related to the COVID vaccine.

Medicated with Tylenol, bananas, oatmeal and herbal tea.  Documented on pdf form, but unable to use &#34;continuation page&#34;, so added sheet that unable to attach.  Will try again to upload and send separately to this.  NO forms given to me at pharmacy for reporting anything.  I called several times and left messages, but no return call.  Sent email, but response saying unable to help at this time.  Very frustrating as I continued having severe symptoms and unable to get help.  Finally feeling better enough today to send form.

Massive headache by Monday and ringing in ears.  Took Naproxin and Mucinex Monday morning before going to work.  At the end of the day I took Naproxin and Mucinex in order to sleep.  By Tuesday I had chest congestion which has gotten only worse along with needle-like pain in the chest upon coughing. I spit up yellow phlegm, tiredness behind eyes returned, sneezing, choking on phlegm, and constant runny nose and ringing in ears.  This has made working difficult, but not impossible.  Please ignore if these are normal reactions.  I&#39;m just not sure.

                                                By April 13, I had completely lost the hearing in my right ear. I was diagnosed with SHL, sudden sensorial hearing loss.  No treatment. Permanent deafness. Use of hearing aid will not help.

Also,  slight nausea began within 5 minutes of injection and has not totally diminished, but the MAJOR issue is the tinnitus!!

                                                Existing mild tinnitus became severe five days after vaccination on March 31, 2021.   24 hours per day--Ears pulsing.  Ears hurt. Headache.  Can&#39;t sleep due to EXTREMELY loud ringing in both ears.  Difficulty performing everyday tasks.  I know of no other adverse event that occurred at this time other than vaccination.  Visited primary care physician on April 8, 2021.  She could not say for certain why I have these sudden ear symptoms.  She wants me to monitor for 2-3 weeks.

                                                All my teeth began to ache and progressively get worse to the  point I wanted to pull the out. At the same time it felt like my head (in notch immediately forward of middle of ear to ear)  was in a tightening vise.  Then I got hot and cold  but not severely.  Same for dizziness, very mild. I was nasusseous and not able to eat.  I had random muscles pains , none lasting more than a few minutes in any one place. Odd thing was that I felt no discomfort at sight of injection. Next day I felt just as bad but at 8:30pm I felt like throwing up (after having 2 teaspons of vegetarian vegetable soup). However, I only had dry heaves. I live by myself and started to get scared. I called my daughter and took a Tylenol at 9pm. Within 10 minutes the feeling of a vise and my aching teeth felt significantly better. but  stil very fatigued. Next day, today,  I feel much better but still a little foggy headed. I can eat. I can function normally, thank heavens. If I had to take another shot now, I wouldn&#39;t. Not even sure I&#39;ll take a booster when it comes out . It was very scarey.

                                                I started having headaches everyday that increased in intensity throughout the day and felt really sick. It hurt all over, but mainly in the back. I waited to call the doctor because I have seasonal allergies. My head would feel really tingling on the outside, I started experiencing a high pitched screaming sound in my ears and I felt foggy/off, along with memory issues. So after a month, I decided to call my doctor and we had a video call. She ordered an MRI, which hasn&#39;t been done yet. I had a CBC count done in the middle of April and it was normal. The headaches are getting better and I&#39;m getting them about once a week versus daily. However, I did have a really bad headache yesterday that I would say was over a 10 on the pain scale, but it&#39;s better today.

                                                Sore arm right away and then went to a sore muscle like normal the next day and was sore for three days. What happened next, I had gone to ENT for my ear (5th) and he put me on heavy dose of Prednisone (6th). Following Tuesday, I was on Prednisone for ear. I was already really achy by then. On the third day after the Prednisone I fatigue, headaches and neck pain but I didn&#39;t have any other pain. I still couldn&#39;t hear though.  I was on this for almost 4 weeks and from them I started like I was having a hot flash and then I would get cold; sore throat; headaches heavy bones and achy muscles; earaches; fatigue; dizziness like you wouldn&#39;t believe. They were cyclical - I&#39;d have them for a couple days and then for about a half a day I&#39;d be a bit better and then it would start up again. The fatigues and dizziness didn&#39;t change when the other symptoms seemed to be a bit better. My hearing didn&#39;t start to clear until I went to see the 2nd ENT which was a couple of weeks down the road. I do not have the stamina I had before the vaccine - I&#39;m not sleeping well at night and I&#39;m always short of breath at any exertion. It is improving but it&#39;s slow. Again, the symptoms I experienced during cyclical times: Cold symptoms, runny nose, sore mouth, ringing in my ears was horrible; dizziness and short of breath - cyclical for three weeks. The Prednisone took away all my cramps and pain in my joints that I had before the vaccine. Currently: My heart feels like it&#39;s going 100 miles an hour at night in bed - chest discomfort at night. Legs blue in the shower. The week of the 28th, I was done with the Prednisone and then all the pain came back and more. I can&#39;t take an inflammatory - the pain is still there and my usual cramps came back.

I was coughing a lot and I could not breathe and it was terrible. I was also tired and my muscles were sore. I made a doctor&#39;s appointment and I was waiting on the car and I tried eating some chips and I could not taste them.  Then they let me in the hospital and I had a Covid test done and it was positive. That happened in 04/09/2021.  They gave me a medicine for vertigo and an inhaler, Ibuterol and a medicine to control wheezing in my lungs

Appointment with Dr, ENT scheduled for 3/25/2021.  He said I was about the 5th vaccine related hearing loss he had seen, and has prescribed a course of Prednisone, in hopes hearing will return.

Saturday morning, I had more blisters. On Tuesday, I went to my PCP, he felt like I was turning the corner and thanked me for coming in. Tuesday night, it was bad. I called the pharmacy and they advised calling my doctor.  I called the doctor and talked to the nurse but my doctor was out of town. Late Wednesday night, I picked up a script to rinse  my mouth with. On Friday, I went to the ED and was diagnosed with Shingles and went to a different doctor for treament and was given medicine. I had pain even when using the ear drops.  I stopped the ear drops as directed. I developed paralysis on the right side of my face. I went to an UC you was diagnosed with Ramsey Hunt Syndrome.

She has swelling in her medial malleolar area with negative calf tenderness or Homans&#39; sign. Due to recent findings with Johnson&amp;Johnson vaccine, will send patient for doppler testing to look for the presence of a clot. Her swelling could be due to mild injury while working in her garden or varicose veins.  o Will obtain CBC to evaluate platelets due to patient&#39;s concerns for recent vaccine.  o Other complaints that may be related to the vaccine (visual change and fluid area on shin) have now resolved. Discussed with patient that based on the vaccines being new, difficult to know what side effects may be seen, but she should continue to watch for changes and encouraged her to see an eye specialist for an eye check.  o Last vitamin D was normal and advised that no check necessary at this time and that she can take Vitamin D 1000-2000 units daily.
