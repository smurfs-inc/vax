                                                Initial symptoms of visual impairment, later diagnosed as visual snow, occurred on Sunday 3/28 along with a headache. Assumed it was a migraine, but after it continued on Monday 3/29 I called advise nurse and scheduled exams for my eyes. The eye doctor confirmed it seems to be experiencing symptoms of visual snow. My vision is currently still looks like static. It has not gone away.  Google search showed potential side effect of astrazeca vaccine in their report so am assuming it is also a side effect of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine as this occurred as a result of receiving it.  I never had this before.

                                                Muscle aches in armpits began a few hours after receiving the dose.  Within 8 hours of dose, a mild fever and chills began (around 100 degrees F). I attempted to take a bath to soothe aches but it did not help, and instead tried to go to sleep at 8:30 pm. A slight red rash appeared on chest and arms around this time.  I was woken up at 10:30 pm feeling disoriented and hot, with a fever of 104.5 degrees F. My wife noticed slurring of words and that I seemed unstable and confused, and symptoms were severe enough we considered going to the emergency room.  I experienced ringing in my ears and a severe headache.  I took 2 extra strength Tylenol, put a cold cloth on forehead, and drank fluids to fall back asleep.  Fever dropped to around 102 but continued throughout the night.  I woke up at 6:30 am and took two more Tylenol.  The severe headache continued and I vomited twice.  I attempted to take a shower and rinse off, and continue to rest.  Fever is reduced to 99 degrees F with help of Tylenol.

                                                Patient felt dizzy and lightheaded, had slight blurred vision and was seeing spotty. He was given water/snacks/candy. We had him lie down and complete a couple of breathing exercises for about 15-20 minutes. Was complaining of dizziness intermittently in between lying down and sitting up. Vitals were checked by nurse, pulse ox and heart rate were normal. Patient felt better after about 30 minutes, EMTs were called and checked vitals - completely fine. Patient did not feel the need to go to the hospital.

                                                Joints began feeling achy and body felt tired within a few hours of vaccination. About 10 hours later body began to feel warm and then within an hour began uncontrollable shivers and aching in testicles followed shortly after by a throbbing headache and pain behind eyeballs. I put on extra clothing and jumped into bed as symptoms persisted. Later in the night I began sweating profusely and removed the clothing. The headache and pain behind the eyes persisted. I also began feeling nauseous and almost vomited when I went to the bathroom. My body was so tired and achy I could barely move. I tried to wake up for work but my headache and pain behind the eyes was so bad I went back to bed for another four hours. I did not have any appetite for the rest of the day.  My headache subsided that afternoon and I went for a walk that night and my body still felt incredibly tired and achy. The pain behind my eyes persisted. The following day I felt somewhat better and could work. That night I went for a jog and my body felt extremely heavy, my joints ached, and I could not catch my breath. My symptoms continued to improve but I have had no sex drive for a week.

Upon standing up from the laying down position, I got lightheaded, started profusely sweating, became nauseous and ultimately lost consciousness. When I regained my consciousness, there was a loud ringing in my ears and my hands were numb. I took some Tylenol, laid down and it subsided shortly after. I did not experience any symptoms as severe as this at any point again.

On Monday, I woke up and I was too dizzy to walk. The initial dizziness subsided but I&#39;m still having balance issues as of Wednesday night. A doctor prescribed meclizine which didn&#39;t help.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the injection, I became dizzy and lightheaded. My  eyesight became blurry and my hearing very &#34;tinny&#34;. I felt nausea and  thought I was going to throw up. I sat down in a chair and was given a granola bar and some water. After about 3 or 4 minutes the majority of these  seemed to fade, but I still felt slightly &#34;off&#34;. Approximately 9pm that evening I felt very fatigued, so I went to bed. At approximately midnight, I woke up shivering, extremely cold, and sweating. Around 2am I had a fever of 102.3. I took some Tylenol to try to bring my fever down, which seemed to help. Around 9am the next morning my fever was gone, though I still felt extremely fatigued.  Later that evening, after several naps, I started to feel a little better. Most of these adverse events were resolved by 28 hours after injection. I had arm soreness at the injection sight that felt like having been punched in the arm for about a week after the injection.

                                                After receiving my Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine I experienced a lack of motor function in my throat. Approximately 40 minutes after having received the shot, I lost the ability swallow. A tingling sensation took the back of my throat and eventually felt as though it moved into my head. The whole experience lasted a couple of minutes. Since that time all other symptoms have been normal, sore, slight fever, etc.

I was wearing contacts and had my prescription renewed 2 days before my vaccination so I don&#39;t think my contacts are the issue. I  The discomfort feels like my eyes are having trouble focusing even though I can see fine. It&#39;s as if my eye muscles are strained. It also feels like I&#39;ve been trying to look at something very close to my eyes for a long time even though I haven&#39;t. I&#39;m not certain, but I think the discomfort is on top or behind my eyeballs. My optometrist told me to stop wearing contacts for 2 weeks and that&#39;s helped but I still have slight discomfort still, especially when driving or having to focus on near and far objects.

Atfer getting water, patient felt dizziness and was about to faint.  We called 911 and monitored him until EMT team came.  Patient was still conscious and said he felt dizzy, sweating due to potential low blood sugar and asked for a sip of gatorade. Then he started felling better after that and he said it happened before during his MRI and other procedure.  EMT team accessed his vital signs and symptoms inside their vehicle and finally released him home. His family took him home

                                                I received my vaccine this morning at 6:12AM and felt fine after. Around 7:45AM I started to feel slightly short of breathe, but figured it was just from the cold outside and my Asthma. The shortness of breathe feeling goes away. Later in the day sometime after 3 PM, I start to feel as if I am getting stuffy. I take a nap on the buss on my way home, and when I wake up I suddenly feel like I am freezing and have chills all throughout my body. I get home and jump in a hot shower to warm up, but it did not help. I then heat up some food to eat dinner, and I go to drink some soda, and I notice I have no taste. I figured the soda was flat, but even flat soda has some taste to it. I then drink a Cherry Gatorade, and still no taste. Now I check my temperature and it is at 101.4, and I have a slight cough.
