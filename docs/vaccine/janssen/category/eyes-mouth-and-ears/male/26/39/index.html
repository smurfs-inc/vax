Hearing came back after 5 minutes, but moderate body shakes began and lasted an hour. Got very cold feeling and began to feel fever like. Took acetaminophen and covered up with blankets and drank water. Took a couple hour nap and woke up sweating with terrible migraine and light body shakes. Fell asleep for a few more hours and woke up not feeling feverish, but migraine and body aches. 22 hours after onset I have a light headache and body aches and am mostly feeling recovered.

                                                Initial symptoms of visual impairment, later diagnosed as visual snow, occurred on Sunday 3/28 along with a headache. Assumed it was a migraine, but after it continued on Monday 3/29 I called advise nurse and scheduled exams for my eyes. The eye doctor confirmed it seems to be experiencing symptoms of visual snow. My vision is currently still looks like static. It has not gone away.  Google search showed potential side effect of astrazeca vaccine in their report so am assuming it is also a side effect of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine as this occurred as a result of receiving it.  I never had this before.

My vision has continued to be impaired with it being similar to static and has caused headaches.   After research I saw AstraZeneca had this in their files as a possible side effect. I understand it is different but made with similar technology so it may or may not be true for J&amp;J vaccine, but this has continued for almost a month so I am concerned.

After returning from the bathroom, the patient informed he gotten a little dizzy in the bathroom and passed out.  His head was bleeding.

Then he felt like he fell asleep until the person checking him called at him.  He had some vision and hearing impairment at the beginning, then after 10 minutes he was better. His arm was hot, he was sweating, his skin was turning white color.  His mom came (she was shopping) and said the patient is usually an anxious person, so it was overwhelming to be at department store and getting the shot.  After another 10 minutes, he was drinking water, his senses were back, he was fine.

I quickly grabbed an ice pack and placed it behind his neck to keep him awake. He started leaning forward and told me he is loosing his vision. He leaned forward and I had to support his chest with my arm all the while trying to talk to him. He dropped his phone and wallet on the floor. He seemed to be loosing conciousness. I had an epinephrine 0.3 mg in my hand but because he was speaking I did not inject him. After about 20 seconds he started gaining his vision back but he said his vision is still fuzzy. After about 2 minutes he felt better so I asked him to position himself at the blood pressure machine. It was 86/65. He does not take any medications or has any health issues. After 10 minutes he took blood pressure again and it was around 129/91. He used the restaurant during the 10 m inute break.

Pt&#39;s friend showed up to pick him up and he was able to walk out to the car without issue.

While driving home after leaving the pharmacy, I started experiencing light headed ness and dizziness.  This eventually turned into tunnel vision which I thought was going to result in me fainting.  This led me to start pulling over, but then the tunnel vision went away.  During my short 10 minute drive home, this happened to me twice.  After getting home, I had about 3 similar episodes during which similar light headedness happened.  These all felt like they were getting close to fainting, and at one point while walking up the stairs in my house I could not stand.  All of these symptoms started approximately 20 minutes after leaving the store, and then took place in a 20-30 minute timespan. Roughly 4-5 episodes in total, including the drive home and short time spent at home.  No issues after lightheadedness stopped, besides feeling tired.    I do not have a history of anxiety attacks due to needles.  Donated blood and plasma in college, and have recieved many vaccines and never had this happen.

The second day I had blurry vision and all those symptoms so I went to doctor. They said I was having a reaction and also gave me Toradol for the back pain. I started to feel better symptom wise  but the following day I started to poop blood. That only happened for one day then went away after a day. But I?ve had one or two more bloody stools since then. The ER said that it?s likely from the Toradol but to keep an eye on it. I have had 2 episodes since but it?s been random. Haven?t taken any more ibuprofen at all, was told to take omeprazole for a month and see how my body recovers

On April 16th I still had the headaches and leg pain , but also while driving I began loosing my vision and started to pass out/faint. I Pulled over and waited at least a half hour. during that time I. noticed I couldn&#39;t type or read anything on my phone as I was trying to reach a friend to help me. eventually after time had passed I was able to drive myself to a friends where I thought the best thing would be to sleep it off. the headaches and leg pain lasted a couple more days and I thought it was going to go away, but it is now May 5th and today and last couple days the leg pain feels more like someone has been punching my left leg. five had chest pain and headaches return. I do not have medical insurance and have avoided going to the hospital or primary care because I am afraid. today the pain is so irritating and sore I wish I could escape my body.

Upon arriving at the chair, patient fainted and fell to the floor, patient was out for approximately 20 seconds and came to.  I then asked the patient if he hurt or felt injured, assessed his alerteness he was alert and oriented x 3.  He transitioned to chair under own power and was speaking with me, his eyes then rolled back in his head for approximately 10 seconds went out again.  At this time we called the ambulance, they came to assess patient, patient refused transport to hosptial and left under his own power.

                                                After injection, patient jolted and eyes fluttered. He seemed to be having a seizure like reaction. He then slumped to side and head hit side of wall since we had chair with side rails positioned against wall. He lost conscious for maybe 30 seconds and then eyes opened. I asked if he was OK and the first thing he asked for was water. He said he felt light headed and dizzy. I had my intern who was working grab him water from the deli and had him sit and rest. He started sweating and asked for paper towels. I grabbed him a couple of towels so he can wipe his face. I continued to check on him while doing my work. He seemed fine after that. After 30 minutes, I checked his blood pressure. It read 100/63.  I continued to monitor him and he left after that. He did have friend with him the entire time who helped him.

He was moved to the floor, lying on his back, and his legs were elevated on the chair.  I informed the patient to take slow, deep breaths.  The patient said he immediately started to feel better once moving to the floor.  He remained in this position for about 10 minutes, feeling better the entire time.  He slowly sat up to a seated position for about a minute, and upon feeling fine, he stood up and felt normal.  The patient informed me that he has a history of dizziness and fainting with different vaccines in the past and this is not an unusual reaction for him.

                                                Muscle aches in armpits began a few hours after receiving the dose.  Within 8 hours of dose, a mild fever and chills began (around 100 degrees F). I attempted to take a bath to soothe aches but it did not help, and instead tried to go to sleep at 8:30 pm. A slight red rash appeared on chest and arms around this time.  I was woken up at 10:30 pm feeling disoriented and hot, with a fever of 104.5 degrees F. My wife noticed slurring of words and that I seemed unstable and confused, and symptoms were severe enough we considered going to the emergency room.  I experienced ringing in my ears and a severe headache.  I took 2 extra strength Tylenol, put a cold cloth on forehead, and drank fluids to fall back asleep.  Fever dropped to around 102 but continued throughout the night.  I woke up at 6:30 am and took two more Tylenol.  The severe headache continued and I vomited twice.  I attempted to take a shower and rinse off, and continue to rest.  Fever is reduced to 99 degrees F with help of Tylenol.

The next morning, one ear was better, but my left ear still has ringing and I can barely hear out of it. I got my ears flushed at doctors and that did not help the issue either. I have never had tinnitus or any other ear issues in the past. Left ear is still ringing as of 3-30-21.

The ambulance came and took him to the ER. later in the day, his manager said that he spoke to hid family and they told him that he has been having anxiety from doctors, needls, and shots ever since he was little. He is feeling better now and the hospital will keep him for tomorrow.

                                                ED NOTE is as follows...from 4/21/21 @ 21:47    a 28 y.o. male who to the emergency room with reports of a headache for the last 48 hours.  He reports this as being one of the worst headaches he has ever had.  He was seen at urgent care and given Toradol, Zofran and Benadryl and still rates his pain an 8 out of 10.  He does feel pressure behind his eyes.  And reports vomiting in the parking lot at urgent care.  He denies abdominal pain back pain, neck pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, numbness or tingling or any other worsening concerns.  Reports that he did receive a recent Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination.  Patient states he does vape.  He occasionally drinks alcohol he denies any illicit drugs.  Patient denies any head trauma.   Diagnosis management comments: This is a 28-year-old male arrives to the emergency room with reported migraine headache for the last 48 hours.  He did report that he was go to urgent care in which he received a migraine cocktail of Zofran, Benadryl and Toradol.  Patient reported that his headache was not resolved so urgent care sent him on for further evaluation.  Patient upon arrival had a negative neurological exam however he did report that he had pressure behind his eyes.  Was unable to see any papilledema on funduscopic exam.  Check patient&#39;s pressures bilaterally and they were 21 and 18.  Patient did report to me that this was the worst headache of his life.  I did administer IV fluids here as well as Tylenol and morphine.  Patient did report some improvement.  Patient did report in his past medical history had a recent Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination.  A CBC and CMP was obtained.  Did have thrombocytopenia with a count of 66.  Since my exam was PERRL with normal extraocular movements.  He had no eye redness or eye pain.  Of low concerns for any iritis or uveitis.  Patient&#39;s patient CT of his head did show a abnormal CT that had a dense appearing superior sagittal sinus that was representing a venous thrombosis.  Radiologist did recommend a MRI MRV.  An MRI and MRV was ordered.  Patient MRI MRv did show findings are consistent with a venous thrombosis involving the right jugular right transverse sinus and superior sagittal sinus there is also a patchy edematous change within the subcortical white matter areas bilaterally and symmetrically.  There was no CVA.  With patient&#39;s reported migraine headache.  Reported blurred vision, low platelets, recent vaccination I do believe patient has vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia.  With this finding I did converse with my overseeing physician Calls were made out to neurology and then a call out did prefer to have patient started on IVIG at 1 g/kg daily for 2 days and blood thinner Xarelto 15 mg p.o. twice daily.  These orders were initiated.  Internal med services was consulted and with conversations of family, internal med services out possible transfer that an interventionalists could be available if patient needed it.  Report was given at 2100 upon my end of shift.

As the day went on the rash progressed and swelling of lips and uvula occurred around 5pm. I was taken to an urgent care who transferred me to a hospital via rescue. I spent the night at the hospital receiving multiple epi pen injections, and fluids. I was discharged 5/22 with a dose of prednisone. I was fatigued all day. On 5/23 I woke up to swollen eyes and lips and covered in hives again. I went to the ER where I was given steroids and fluids again. The hives went down but did not go away.  One 5/24 I took multiple doses of Benadryl and dose of prednisone and in the evening time the hives progressed. Today 5/25 I woke up with swollen lips and checks and hives. I went to my doctors office to be evaluated.

                                                Approximately 3 minutes following administration of vaccine, the skin on the patients face, arms, and legs turned red and the patient began to sweat profusely. The patient reported that he was feeling dizzy and had blurred vision. The patient did not report any shortness of breath or swelling of the face, throat, or lips. Physical assessment confirmed patients report of no swelling of the face, throat, or lips. The patient was treated with an ice pack to the back of the neck and was advised to place his head between his legs. The pharmacy student remained with the patient for 30 minutes after the reaction occurred. During the 30 minutes, the patient reported that his dizziness and blurred vision were improving and he was no longer sweating. Physical assessment of the injection site found that there was no redness, swelling, or rash developing. After 30 minutes had elapsed since the reaction, the patient reported that he was no longer dizzy, experiencing blurred vision, or sweating. Assessment of the injection site at this point was the same as above with no redness, swelling, or rash occurring. At this point, the patient was cleared to leave the pharmacy and was advised to go home and rest for the night and not perform any strenuous activity.

The fourth and fifth day my lips and face would become tingly/numb and my left arm would get weak and I would feel a little disoriented, my sleep has been pretty disturbed. It felt like I was having a stroke. I did not have a stroke,  I continue to occasionally feel the above symptoms, a little less potent than they were, they might be going away, I can&#39;t tell. I will be calling my doctor if it continues.

Slept until 11:15pm and woke up to violent shivering, pounding headache, full body aches, sore skin, achey joints, nausea, swelling tongue and throat. Took 1 dose of nyquil and then tossed and turned all night, very little sleep, symptoms persisted into the next day, but shivering stopped in the night. By morning (3-14) registered a fever of 100.3 which persisted most of the day along with remaining lessening symptoms. By evening I was still very sore, bad headache, and very lethargic/fatigued. Next morning (3-15) low temp of 97.1 degrees, headache, fatigue, lightheaded. Still feel headachy and tired.

                                                On Day 2 after getting vaccine, fluid buildup in ears spiked and persisted, causing a range of symptoms. Symptoms include ear pressure, popping, crackling, and high-pitched tinnitus. Urgent care and PCP all saw fluid behind eardrums in two weeks prior, during week 3 saw an ENT who said fluid was not present anymore, however the audiologist confirmed that negative pressure still exists in both ear tubes. Tinnitus and symptoms persist through week 4 (at present).

She states his eyes rolled back and then slumped over and arms flailed a few times. The patient didn&#39;t know it had happened. He stated he felt dizzy and looked pale. We gave him a water bottle and after a few minutes he felt better.

                                                The patient received the COVID-19/Janssen vaccine at 12:33pm.  Approximately, 5 minutes after receiving it, the stated that he was feeling dizzy and had ringing in his ears.  I had him lie down with his knees elevated.  He stated that he felt better in the supine position.  I attempted to take his blood pressure, but was unable to get a reading after two tries.  After a few minutes, he stated that he no longer had any ringing in his ears, but felt some numbness in his arms.  His fingers were cold and I had a difficult time finding his pulse.  While he was resting, he stated that he had anxiety to needles and &#34;white coat&#34; syndrome.  He felt that he was okay to sit up, so he did without any adverse reactions.  He drank some water and stated that feeling was returning to his arm.  I asked if he had eaten anything this morning and was told, just a cup of coffee.  We speculated that low blood sugar could have possibly compounded the situation.  At approximately 12:55pm, he felt well enough to leave.  I had him contact his mother who was in the store to accompany him out at around 1:00pm.

He was very panicked and stated he thought it was a dream.  He was extremely pale and very sweaty.  We gave him some water and an ice pack to cool down.  We checked his blood pressure.  He then lied down on the floor and we elevated his feet.  He then stated he could not move his hands and his lips were tingly.  We then gave him some liquid benadryl and continued checking his blood pressure and called EMS.  They arrived and he left with them.  I tried contacting him later without success.  Will try again tomorrow.

                                                Joints began feeling achy and body felt tired within a few hours of vaccination. About 10 hours later body began to feel warm and then within an hour began uncontrollable shivers and aching in testicles followed shortly after by a throbbing headache and pain behind eyeballs. I put on extra clothing and jumped into bed as symptoms persisted. Later in the night I began sweating profusely and removed the clothing. The headache and pain behind the eyes persisted. I also began feeling nauseous and almost vomited when I went to the bathroom. My body was so tired and achy I could barely move. I tried to wake up for work but my headache and pain behind the eyes was so bad I went back to bed for another four hours. I did not have any appetite for the rest of the day.  My headache subsided that afternoon and I went for a walk that night and my body still felt incredibly tired and achy. The pain behind my eyes persisted. The following day I felt somewhat better and could work. That night I went for a jog and my body felt extremely heavy, my joints ached, and I could not catch my breath. My symptoms continued to improve but I have had no sex drive for a week.

                                                I had received the Janessen vaccine around 3:30pm. Around 1 am I woke up to shivering and chills. My head felt extremely pressurized inside. My eyes felt like they were being pushed out of their sockets. My body hurt. It hurt to move. My neck , knees, ankles and back were in shooting dull pain. It took everything I had to stand up. I couldn&#39;t get to sleep. I had a fever. I started to shiver. My thought raced. It began to hurt to breath. My lower chest is sore on the inside where the lungs meets the rib cage.   I could not to go class or do any work. Was easily one of the worst nights of my life.

                                                Friday night, Got a migraine and I had it all Saturday to night. I felt nauseous that night. It went away on Sunday. The following Saturday, I had a migraine and it lasted a full eight days - hanging out in my left eye (it was all in that eye - when I moved that eye from left to right, I would feel it) . I had taken Tylenol and ibuprofen but it didn&#39;t do anything.  Some days it was intense and some days it was in the background. I did see and talk to a  someone at my doctor&#39;s office - over video chat (on April 15th - that was day eight of migraine) and she told me to start taking Tylenol that night and I&#39;ve been taking it one time in the morning since that day and it hasn&#39;t come back. I think the migraine went away on it&#39;s own.  I haven&#39;t had a migraine ever in my entire life so it was very unsettling.

Pharmacist rushed to help him up and he complained of feeling very hot and sweating profusely. He did not have any swelling/itching of throat/facial area. Patient was provided cold water, and told to remain seated. Pt was asked questions such as name, what day it is, to establish if patient was alert and oriented. Patient complained of experiencing tunnel vision while passing out. He proceeded to pass out once more, while seated, this time the pharmacist was able to support him in his chair.  After the water and rest, patient said he felt much better and his girlfriend came to escort him home. He stayed for about 30 minutes before leaving and staff made sure he was feeling alright.

She was able to catch his fall and lie him on the ground.  I went into the immunization room to assist immediately and he was apologizing for scaring.  I asked him to lie there for a few minutes and take some deep breaths.  He was talking and aware of his surroundings.  I asked him about his medication history which was null.  I asked him if he had been nervous and he said he didn&#39;t think so. She said that he did mention he did not like needles.  He had not eaten since the morning (a bagel) and it was late in the afternoon.  After a few minutes I asked him if he would like to sit up so I could see how he was doing.  Management arrived and observed while I went to get a cold cloth for his neck/face.  Management asked him if he would like to sit in a chair.  He sat in a chair and before I came back after just a few minutes, he had slumped over to the side with his eyes rolling back.  Management  was concerned so they immediately called 911.  fire department and EMS arrived.  They tested his blood pressure, etc and said they believed he had just passed out.  They asked him if he wanted to go to the hospital.  He declined.  He called a family member to pick him up who arrived about 45 minutes after his vaccination.  He was walking around and coherent when he left.

I did not experience any symptoms as severe as this at any point again.

Sx got worse overnight, and by the next morning he noticed additional sx of tongue numbness/tingling, so went to the ER. ER diagnosed him with allergic reaction and discharged him with a short course of steroids and Rx for Banophen.   He notes that the symptoms returned again on 4/24/21, and again this morning 4/28/21. Went back to ER on 4/24, got more steroids and sx went away. This morning bought OTC Benadryl and sx went away when he took 50-100mg.

The next day my eye was more irritated, and it was uncomfortable. I had a telehealth visit and they gave me antibiotic drops. I was diagnosed by an optometrist on the five days after the vaccine with the Shingles virus. The Shingles are still present on my eye after three weeks and I am taking steroids for that.

The pain started in my teeth, jaw, temple, eye and ear. The next day I went to the dentist thinking it was my wisdom teeth, they checked my teeth, did ex rays and checked for infection but found nothing. Went to my primary care flight doc and she was un sure what was going on. Then I went to the Emergency room and I was diagnosed with Trigeminal Neuralgia of the face.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the injection, I became dizzy and lightheaded. My  eyesight became blurry and my hearing very &#34;tinny&#34;. I felt nausea and  thought I was going to throw up. I sat down in a chair and was given a granola bar and some water. After about 3 or 4 minutes the majority of these  seemed to fade, but I still felt slightly &#34;off&#34;. Approximately 9pm that evening I felt very fatigued, so I went to bed. At approximately midnight, I woke up shivering, extremely cold, and sweating. Around 2am I had a fever of 102.3. I took some Tylenol to try to bring my fever down, which seemed to help. Around 9am the next morning my fever was gone, though I still felt extremely fatigued.  Later that evening, after several naps, I started to feel a little better. Most of these adverse events were resolved by 28 hours after injection. I had arm soreness at the injection sight that felt like having been punched in the arm for about a week after the injection.

Approximately 40 minutes after having received the shot, I lost the ability swallow. A tingling sensation took the back of my throat and eventually felt as though it moved into my head. The whole experience lasted a couple of minutes. Since that time all other symptoms have been normal, sore, slight fever, etc.

I was wearing contacts and had my prescription renewed 2 days before my vaccination so I don&#39;t think my contacts are the issue. I  The discomfort feels like my eyes are having trouble focusing even though I can see fine. It&#39;s as if my eye muscles are strained. It also feels like I&#39;ve been trying to look at something very close to my eyes for a long time even though I haven&#39;t. I&#39;m not certain, but I think the discomfort is on top or behind my eyeballs. My optometrist told me to stop wearing contacts for 2 weeks and that&#39;s helped but I still have slight discomfort still, especially when driving or having to focus on near and far objects.

                                                Approximately 2 minutes after the patient received the vaccine, the patient had other questions and while talking about the vaccine, the patient&#39;s eyes rolled back and he experienced a vasovagal reaction (syncope). Although he was sitting in a chair, his head fell to the left and his forehead bumped the table. The patient&#39;s legs were elevated and his upper body was laid back. Ammonia inhalant was crushed and immediately placed under the patient&#39;s nose. The patient came back to consciousness approximately 30 seconds after passing out. Patient was asked what symptoms he felt leading up to passing out. He said that he suddenly felt dizzy and does not remember much after. Patient states that he did not eat breakfast prior to receiving the vaccine and has a history of not doing well with needles or vaccines. He states that he now feels completely fine, however, the patient was advised to stay 30 minutes for monitoring, and once he felt comfortable standing up, a nurse walked with him to the observation area. Patient was provided an ice pack for his forehead. Observation nurse was notified of the adverse event and is now monitoring the patient.

We heard a crash and the yell of his wife and 3 children.  Found the patient laying on his back on the ground.  Patient was breathing, but non responsive to tapping and shouting.  911 was called.  Patient regained consciousness after about 15-30  seconds.  He complained of being hot, thirsty, having to go to the bathroom and feeling out of it. He appeared pale.  We did record a BP of 95/57.  He remained conscious until EMT&#39;s arrived.  He was attended to and taken to the ER by emergency personal.

                                                April 9 Morning: woke up with a mild headache. April 9 Afternoon (12 pm): feeling fatigued and headache grew worse. Plus chills. April 9 (5pm): feeling very cold and tired (worse than noon) April 9 (11:30pm): This time was the most severe for me in respect to side effects. I believe my headache woke me up. The headache was so bad that my eyes hurt as well (swollen almost). I think my fever broke. I felt very ?heavy? all over. The main concern was that around midnight I was having sharp pains on the right side of my body, near where my Liver is located. That was one effect that I did not read about. The sharp pains happened once every few minutes. I considered going to the ER but wasn?t sure. I ended up just changing my shirt, got some water, and went back to bed.  April 10: My appetite was not normal, I ate but very little. The sharp pain on my right side went away but I had a minor headache for the rest of the day.

Then got the chills pretty bad as I laid down to go to bed. Became really sore all over.  Couldn?t stay asleep for more than an hour. Later in the night I started sweating and felt really hot. Also became quite thirsty. During the entire night I also had horrible dreams. After about 5am things started improving. Had some light sensitivity in the morning for a shot bit. By noon I was almost back to 100%

                                                I typically faint when getting shots or blood drawn. I did faint about 10 seconds after the initial shot injection. I was conscious throughout but was not able to speak clearly or control my body even though I could hear everything going on around me. After 30 minutes, I was feeling back to normal. The remainder of the day I felt drowsy and a little out of it. At 12:15am I began to get severe chills and shakes. This lasted throughout the night but was the worst from about 12:15-1:00am. I woke up at 4am with a fever and sweating. My entire body was stiff and in pain with aches specifically in my arms and legs. Very sore pain in my left deltoid where the shot was injected and is still slightly sensitive. It felt like my veins were stiff and in pain and it hurt to move. I had what I can describe as flu like symptoms (i.e. my teeth hurt, my body ached, fever, shakes, body stiffness and overall tiredness and weakness). These all lasted until about 6:30am at the worst and were relieved over the next few hours. I started to feel back to normal around 3pm later that day. That was April 11th. Last night, April 12th, I had trouble sleeping because my left arm was in pain from my elbow to fingers. It was a lingering pain that went away by this morning and  is mostly gone now (morning April 13th).

Around 5 hours after injection I was overcome with extreme lethargy and had to sleep. 8 hours after injection I woke up very nauseous and could not stop salivating, however I never puked. I woke up again 18 hours after injection and felt nauseous and my chronic back pain had returned. I also had a weird throbbing pain in the right side of my neck and in the lower left side of my left leg. All symptoms were gone by ~36 hours after the injection.

                                                I experienced a sudden onset of symptoms approximately 7 hours post-vaccination. Symptoms started with severe chills, elevated heart rate, fever (~102), and progressed into muscle and joint soreness, severe migraine with sensitivity to light, and strong fatigue, coupled with insomnia. The symptoms were severe enough that I considered going to the hospital, but ultimately did not. Fever, chills, and elevated heart rate subsided by the next morning (~12 hours after onset), but muscle soreness, migraine, and fatigue lasted for another 12-24 hours, along with a loss of appetite.  I am an otherwise healthy, male adult with no outstanding medical conditions whatsoever. This was one of the most severe immune responses I have ever had, including actual illnesses. I have received other vaccinations in the past and never had any response nearly as severe. I was significantly concerned for my overall health during the height of the vaccine response, and I wanted to report this to ensure that is aware of these types of responses, and can help prepare others by informing them adequately of the types of responses to expect from the vaccine. This response very much took me by surprise in terms of severity -- I had to call out of work at a critical time.

                                                This is a comprehensive neurological evaluation for a very pleasant right handed 32 year old gentleman who denies any past medical history who presents to the hospital with several day progressive visual changes and facial weakness. Patient reports he noted on Saturday that he had somewhat of a headache, he does get headaches from time to time in particular while looking at screens the television, he did have some associated blurring of his vision as well. This was not the worst headache of his life. He had no other associated symptoms. He went to bed on Saturday, he awoke on Sunday and went out to eat and noted that he couldn&#39;t form his mouth around the utensil, his face and lips and mouth felt weak. He still did have an intermittent headache and perhaps some neck pain as well at this point. His vision was still blurry. He denies any recent trauma, no car accident no whiplash no falls. He did go to an outside facility where a CT brain was performed and was normal he was told. He has noted yesterday that he could not close his eyes unless he did it manually, also he notes the way his voice sounds is different to him. He has not appreciated any weakness of his arms or legs. He is able to lift up his head off the bed without trouble. He does not think he has a hard time swallowing or breathing per se however he does describe that he is more &#34;aware&#34; of his breathing. He describes paresthesias of his face and around his mouth. No recent URI or diarrheal/GI illness, he did receive the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID -19 vaccine March 31st. Seen and evaluated in the ED with ed staff. He does report he recently ran a virtual type marathon over the course of 16 days. Clinical context and exam most consistent with that of GBS type variant (?Miller Fisher).  Treated with IVIG.  Symptoms improved after 1 dose.  4 more doses pending.

                                                Patient had standard side effects (fever, fatigue, muscle soreness) day 1 and 2 after vaccination. Starting approx. 3 days after vaccination, patient started noticing altered smell and taste, which has gotten worse in the 14 days since vaccination. Patient also has fatigue and has been experiencing weakness since vaccination. These symptoms are identical to the symptoms the patient had with COVID (starting ~3 weeks after contracting COVID and lasting over a month). The patient contracted COVID in December 2020 and had fully recovered prior to vaccination. Recrudescence of symptoms appears to be due to immunological response to the vaccine.

I do not suffer from asthma prior to this vaccine. I experienced headaches, fatigue, congestion, my ears were plugged and I also developed a rash on my arms and I also noticed a lymph node in my neck that I did not have prior to the vaccine. When I went to see my doctor my symptoms were not as prominent and the lymph node in my neck is decreasing in size.

Shortly afterwards while waiting in pharmacy area, we were alerted that the patient was unresponsive by his wife. Immediately responded to patient. Code white called and management responded. Tried to get him to wake up, he opened his eyes but immediately closed them again. I attempted to keep him alert and eyes open. This proceeded to go on for several minutes. Ice packs were placed on neck and wrists. Feet elevated. Once patient was alert and oriented, water was provided and patient was instructed to take small sips. Patient was kept in pharmacy area for additional 15 minutes once he was back to normal. Patient stated that when he passed out, he felt tired, couldn&#39;t see or hear.

Suddenly I began to get tunnel vision and felt as if I was about to pass out. I was transported via ambulance to Medical Center where I was given IV and medication to treat vertigo and massive head pain/migraine. Since that day I have continually dealt with severe neck and head pain leading to migraines causing visual issues (auras and blind spots), vertigo, and nauseau.

Now I still have a minor headache and a dead arm after taking Tylenol (Rapid Release).    I also felt very weak and fatigued all night with a dry mouth and  plugged up sinus. Felt like I was going to be knocked out for 24 hours. I can hardly do these basic task on my work laptop.

I felt fine the entire time and the morning of 4/6 I couldn&#39;t taste or smell.  I was given a nasal test and it came back positive for COVID.  It&#39;s likely that I contracted it from my wife before the full two weeks were up, but I thought it best to report so any information that could be helpful could be used.  My symptoms have not changed and I don&#39;t feel near as bad as after the vaccine or as my wife who didn&#39;t have the vaccine was!

I parked my vehicle and didn?t feel well so I switched seats with my girl friend. As soon as I got into the passenger seat I was out. She said My eyes rolled back in my head and I started shaking and eyes at this point she said where going up down and side to side . She ran for help and after about 1-2 minutes I  woke up. I thought I passed out so I instantly put my feet on the dash of my car and the pharmacist gave me water and chocolate milk.  He then checked my heart rate it seemed good  and after 20 minutes he let us go home.

                                                After administration of Janssen vaccine 0.5mL, pt reported arm was hurting and he began moving arm.  CMA noticed that continued to shake arm after 5 minutes but patient was alert and oriented x 3.  CMA thought the way he was shaking his arm seemed irregular so she advised pt he would be taken to an observation area for further observation.  Half way to the observation area, pt reported to CMA that he was seeing spots and felt like he was going to get sick.  CMA called for help.  Patient experienced a syncopal event just as he made it to the chair.  Several staff was helping to support patient.  Legs were lifted to another chair.  Patient was not responsive for a short time, very diaphoretic, breathing regular and unlabored.  Patients eyes then rolled upward toward the ceiling and patient&#39;s entire body began shaking uncontrollably while staff managed to keep patient from falling to floor from the chair.  Once patient was conscious, he was able to state his name but reported he was very confused and could not think clearly.  He was able to sit upright.  In the meantime while patient was shaking uncontrollably, staff sought urgent care provider to come and see patient.  Patient was then taken over to the urgent care side of the building to evaluate and treat patient.

Has been going on since right after I got vaccinated.

Around 30-40 minutes later, I began experiencing a reaction I&#39;m not prone to.  I had severe heartburn throughout most of the night and my lips began to swell which made me mistakenly assume I have had a cardiac event. While in the morning the pain had subsided, the numbness in the lips hadn&#39;t and I went to the ER thinking it might&#39;ve been a heart issue. No cardiac condition was noted at the hospital which leads me to believe I may have had a severe allergic reaction to foods or environmentals I&#39;ve never had reactions to.

                                                The night after receiving the vaccine I started to develop a fever and headache. It lasted 3 days for the fever. On Tuesday I felt something different in my body. On Thursday I went to see an Optometrist. While there he found that there was something going on in my eyes. He noticed there was blood clot in the back of my right eye. I did go to the ER because of the blood clot. At the ER I had a CT scan and bloodwork completed. I was told that everything looked normal and I was told to go to a different hospital. I was transferred to  Medical Center. While I was there they performed an MRI, CAT scan and Lumbar function test. I was told that everything looked fine from the neurology point of view. I need to follow up with an Ophthalmologist. I have gone completely blind in my right eye and my left eye is not clear anymore. On 05/20 I had an appointment with the ophthalmologist. There was something wrong with my optic nerve as well. There was a test performed 05/21. I went back to the doctor on 05/26 he said that the reports he received are not making sense to him. My next f/u appointment with Dr.  is 06/09 because the doctor asked to have2 weeks to read through my hospital reports. I saw a different doctor instead on 05/27, Dr. , and he said that this can happen from the vaccine. He said that there is a swelling and I need to see a different doctor about my retina. I was told that I need to see another physician. I saw Dr. .  on 05/27 and he said that there are fluids there, but no one can confirm that this is because of the vaccine. He gave me the option to take prednisone 10mg and I feel that it is working, but it is very slow. It was moved to 3x per day. I can see objects now even though it&#39;s still not clear. I have a f/u with Dr. 06/03.

Atfer getting water, patient felt dizziness and was about to faint.  We called 911 and monitored him until EMT team came.  Patient was still conscious and said he felt dizzy, sweating due to potential low blood sugar and asked for a sip of gatorade. Then he started felling better after that and he said it happened before during his MRI and other procedure.  EMT team accessed his vital signs and symptoms inside their vehicle and finally released him home. His family took him home

While texting her, I started experiencing color distortions and the next thing I knew was the Pharmacist was asking if I could breathe and they laid me down on the floor and called 911. The Fire Department arrived and took my blood pressure and I tried to walk out and the next thing I knew was that I was weak; therefore, the Ambulance transported me to the hospital. In the ER they examine me and ended up giving me a nausea pill after observing me for two hours.

A headache came about 2 hrs after and a little later I developed a fever and the headache went from light to mild.  Throughout the night I could not sleep because the headache had gotten so severe and I had uncontrollable chills and shakes and a fever.  3/6 I did start around the clock Tylenol which did reduce the fever and make the headache less as intense but for about 2 days the headache so bad with pressure  associated it felt as if my eyes were going to bulge out of my head.  By day 3 I woke up feeling better but was in a fog which lasted the remainer of that day and by day 4 all symptoms had subsided

Around 7:45AM I started to feel slightly short of breathe, but figured it was just from the cold outside and my Asthma. The shortness of breathe feeling goes away. Later in the day sometime after 3 PM, I start to feel as if I am getting stuffy. I take a nap on the buss on my way home, and when I wake up I suddenly feel like I am freezing and have chills all throughout my body. I get home and jump in a hot shower to warm up, but it did not help. I then heat up some food to eat dinner, and I go to drink some soda, and I notice I have no taste. I figured the soda was flat, but even flat soda has some taste to it. I then drink a Cherry Gatorade, and still no taste. Now I check my temperature and it is at 101.4, and I have a slight cough.

Then progressed to severe shaking chills, fevers, headaches, tingling/electric shock feeling in back of head/neck, muscle aches, mild joint pain, eye discomfort associated with the headaches, poor appetite at first, trouble sleeping, and fatigue; all of which required doses of Tylenol and ibuprofen and cold packs. Symptoms lasted all night and fever broke overnight after finally falling asleep. The next day (3/17) took some more Tylenol and ibuprofen, but the fever and chills subsided. The other symptoms mostly resolved except was still quite tired and felt weak. Also, had cold sweats all day on 3/17. By around 3/18 most all of the symptoms resolved.  Also, had mild soreness at vaccination site throughout.  I?m a physician. If I wasn?t a physician I may have sought medical attention.

                                                Seven days after vaccine was administered Patient started having symptoms of difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, and breaking out in a rash all over  his torso and upper arms.  His lips also got quite swollen.  The rash eventually spread down both his legs.  He was taken to the emergency room at Hospital, as he was visiting there at the time.  He was given benadryl, and prednisone once his Covid test came back negative.  Blood work, chest x-ray, CT scan of both stomach and chest, EKG and blood work all came back normal.  His resting heart rate was 120 and above, and he required two liters of oxygen to stay in the mid 90&#39;s saturation level.  He spent five days in the hospital before the rash was mostly faded on his torso and his lip swelling had come down.  He was discharged on 3/24/21 with the advice to see his primary care physician, and to be monitored carefully for oxygen saturation and heart rate.  The family could not think of anything he had eaten or come in contact with that would have caused any reaction.  At this time we think it was a reaction to his Janssen vaccine based on all the tests at the hospital coming back normal.

Once there he started to read the provided material (EUA, V-Safe) and started to feel anxious.  He said the next thing he knew he was sweating and had tunnel vision.  He wasn&#39;t 100% sure he passed out.  A fellow associate helped him to the ground and elevated his feet.  We got ice for behind his neck, and a cold cloth for his forehead.  We took his blood pressure and it started to come back up.  He waited for about 30 minutes before leaving.  His color had returned and he stated he felt fine.

A STORE CUSTOMER CALLED 911 AND I BEGAN COMPRESSIONS. AT COUNT 20 HE BEGAN TO MOVE AND TRIED TO TALK. STOPPED COMPRESSIONS, AND ROLLED PATIENT ON HIS LEFT SIDE. I WAS ABOUT TO CHECK BLOOD PRESSURE WHEN PARAMEDICS WALKED IN AND TOOK OVER. PARAMEDICS CHECKED VITALS, TEMPERATURE, BLOOD GLUCOSE AND RAN EKG. THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT SHARE RESULTSWITH ME, BUT STATED PATIENT REFUSED TO GO TO THE ER/HOSPITAL. AFTER ABOUT 30 MINUTES  PATIENT WALKED OUT OF THE STORE ON HIS OWN.

However the next day my upper lip and lower nose swole up in an allergic reaction.  I took Benadryl and went to sleep and by the time I work up it had subsided.  Two days after that incident I woke up (this morning) and my left cheek was swollen from another allergic reaction.  During this time I had not eaten or taken anything out of the ordinary.

Went to ER for evaluation, CT scan with contrast. CT confirmed lump was swelling of lymphoid. ER thought maybe shingles, but it crosses over slightly over to the right with lesions.They determined maybe a virus and follow up with a dermatologist.  4/4/21 lesions now on left eye lid. ER visit again to ensure eye is ok, the ER dr. believes its shingles. 4/5/21 visit to dermatology and swab of lesions on face taken (still waiting on results). Dermatology believes some kind of herpes, but not sure. Went to Eye specialist to ensure eye does not have virus on same day. Eye dr believes shingles. Virus is not in the eye, but on left eyelid.

I was able to drive home 30 minutes later after making sure that all side effects subsided.  I have not experienced any other side effects from the vaccine.

The next morning, I felt very tired walking up stairs from the basement to my room on the 2nd floor..barely made it to the 2nd floor, felt like my body hitting a wall/ no energy to lift my legs up. I made to my bedroom but felt very dizzy, using my hands holding myself up on my desk and realized I might faint any seconds..my vision was bright and blurry. I slowly moved myself to a bed and laid down for a while. Later that day in the late afternoon, my muscles were sore (legs, thighs, back) I could not walk more than 10-15 steps which I needed rest. These conditions lasted me for 6 days since receiving the vaccine and felt better on the 7th day. Currently I&#39;m ok.

                                                Tinnitus in left ear (shot received in left arm). It?s a constant tone. I?ve never had tinnitus previously. Tone was there when I woke up (9-apr, 0800) the morning  following the shot (8-apr, 1400). The tone increased in intensity about a week later and was consistent after that. Based on surrounding conditions, intensity of tone can be a 1/10 with background noise and 6/10  in silence.   Additionally, there is a degree of interference in sounds. If the sound is from a low quality speaker (phone/computer) the sounds generates a static sound, almost like interference or what music sounds like from low quality buffering. Also, music, even played at low volume in speakers, increases the intensity of the tone.

Some leg pain was noticed the 2nd or 3rd day. And I have experienced ear ringing randomly about a week and a half after vaccination. Those may or may not be related.  Also I feel it important to note in March of 2020 (before testing was available) I experienced a very similar set of symptoms: fever, chills, fatigue, multi-day headache, body ache, 6 weeks of slight cough, leg pain, and a day a few weeks after the coughing started where I had shortness of breath. I wasn&#39;t tested back then as it was not available. But based on the symptoms I experienced, I truly believe I had COVID-19 last year prior to vaccination.

                                                I have had headaches every day since I received the vaccination that last most of the day. There is a constant pressure in my head that moves around all areas, from the back base of the head, to the sides, temples, forehead/sinus regions. It is from waking until sleeping. Not incredibly intense, but constant. I have difficulty sleeping through the night and have not slept well since, either. I have also experience blurred vision. I have also experience bruising on various parts of my body including my arm, abdomen, and toe nails. My quality of life has suffered tremendously and I wish I hadn&#39;t gotten the vaccine.
