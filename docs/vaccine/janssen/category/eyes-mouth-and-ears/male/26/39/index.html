                                                Initial symptoms of visual impairment, later diagnosed as visual snow, occurred on Sunday 3/28 along with a headache. Assumed it was a migraine, but after it continued on Monday 3/29 I called advise nurse and scheduled exams for my eyes. The eye doctor confirmed it seems to be experiencing symptoms of visual snow. My vision is currently still looks like static. It has not gone away.  Google search showed potential side effect of astrazeca vaccine in their report so am assuming it is also a side effect of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine as this occurred as a result of receiving it.  I never had this before.

                                                Initial adverse reaction was a headache and impaired vision. My vision has continued to be impaired with it being similar to static and has caused headaches.   After research I saw AstraZeneca had this in their files as a possible side effect. I understand it is different but made with similar technology so it may or may not be true for J&amp;J vaccine, but this has continued for almost a month so I am concerned.

                                                Muscle aches in armpits began a few hours after receiving the dose.  Within 8 hours of dose, a mild fever and chills began (around 100 degrees F). I attempted to take a bath to soothe aches but it did not help, and instead tried to go to sleep at 8:30 pm. A slight red rash appeared on chest and arms around this time.  I was woken up at 10:30 pm feeling disoriented and hot, with a fever of 104.5 degrees F. My wife noticed slurring of words and that I seemed unstable and confused, and symptoms were severe enough we considered going to the emergency room.  I experienced ringing in my ears and a severe headache.  I took 2 extra strength Tylenol, put a cold cloth on forehead, and drank fluids to fall back asleep.  Fever dropped to around 102 but continued throughout the night.  I woke up at 6:30 am and took two more Tylenol.  The severe headache continued and I vomited twice.  I attempted to take a shower and rinse off, and continue to rest.  Fever is reduced to 99 degrees F with help of Tylenol.

Patient upon arrival had a negative neurological exam however he did report that he had pressure behind his eyes.  Was unable to see any papilledema on funduscopic exam.  Check patient&#39;s pressures bilaterally and they were 21 and 18.  Patient did report to me that this was the worst headache of his life.  I did administer IV fluids here as well as Tylenol and morphine.  Patient did report some improvement.  Patient did report in his past medical history had a recent Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination.  A CBC and CMP was obtained.  Did have thrombocytopenia with a count of 66.  Since my exam was PERRL with normal extraocular movements.  He had no eye redness or eye pain.  Of low concerns for any iritis or uveitis.  Patient&#39;s patient CT of his head did show a abnormal CT that had a dense appearing superior sagittal sinus that was representing a venous thrombosis.  Radiologist did recommend a MRI MRV.  An MRI and MRV was ordered.  Patient MRI MRv did show findings are consistent with a venous thrombosis involving the right jugular right transverse sinus and superior sagittal sinus there is also a patchy edematous change within the subcortical white matter areas bilaterally and symmetrically.  There was no CVA.  With patient&#39;s reported migraine headache.  Reported blurred vision, low platelets, recent vaccination I do believe patient has vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia.  With this finding I did converse with my overseeing physician Calls were made out to neurology and then a call out did prefer to have patient started on IVIG at 1 g/kg daily for 2 days and blood thinner Xarelto 15 mg p.o. twice daily.  These orders were initiated.  Internal med services was consulted and with conversations of family, internal med services out possible transfer that an interventionalists could be available if patient needed it.  Report was given at 2100 upon my end of shift.

The fourth and fifth day my lips and face would become tingly/numb and my left arm would get weak and I would feel a little disoriented, my sleep has been pretty disturbed. It felt like I was having a stroke. I did not have a stroke,  I continue to occasionally feel the above symptoms, a little less potent than they were, they might be going away, I can&#39;t tell. I will be calling my doctor if it continues.

Slept until 11:15pm and woke up to violent shivering, pounding headache, full body aches, sore skin, achey joints, nausea, swelling tongue and throat. Took 1 dose of nyquil and then tossed and turned all night, very little sleep, symptoms persisted into the next day, but shivering stopped in the night. By morning (3-14) registered a fever of 100.3 which persisted most of the day along with remaining lessening symptoms. By evening I was still very sore, bad headache, and very lethargic/fatigued. Next morning (3-15) low temp of 97.1 degrees, headache, fatigue, lightheaded. Still feel headachy and tired.

                                                Joints began feeling achy and body felt tired within a few hours of vaccination. About 10 hours later body began to feel warm and then within an hour began uncontrollable shivers and aching in testicles followed shortly after by a throbbing headache and pain behind eyeballs. I put on extra clothing and jumped into bed as symptoms persisted. Later in the night I began sweating profusely and removed the clothing. The headache and pain behind the eyes persisted. I also began feeling nauseous and almost vomited when I went to the bathroom. My body was so tired and achy I could barely move. I tried to wake up for work but my headache and pain behind the eyes was so bad I went back to bed for another four hours. I did not have any appetite for the rest of the day.  My headache subsided that afternoon and I went for a walk that night and my body still felt incredibly tired and achy. The pain behind my eyes persisted. The following day I felt somewhat better and could work. That night I went for a jog and my body felt extremely heavy, my joints ached, and I could not catch my breath. My symptoms continued to improve but I have had no sex drive for a week.

                                                Friday night, Got a migraine and I had it all Saturday to night. I felt nauseous that night. It went away on Sunday. The following Saturday, I had a migraine and it lasted a full eight days - hanging out in my left eye (it was all in that eye - when I moved that eye from left to right, I would feel it) . I had taken Tylenol and ibuprofen but it didn&#39;t do anything.  Some days it was intense and some days it was in the background. I did see and talk to a  someone at my doctor&#39;s office - over video chat (on April 15th - that was day eight of migraine) and she told me to start taking Tylenol that night and I&#39;ve been taking it one time in the morning since that day and it hasn&#39;t come back. I think the migraine went away on it&#39;s own.  I haven&#39;t had a migraine ever in my entire life so it was very unsettling.

Upon standing up from the laying down position, I got lightheaded, started profusely sweating, became nauseous and ultimately lost consciousness. When I regained my consciousness, there was a loud ringing in my ears and my hands were numb. I took some Tylenol, laid down and it subsided shortly after. I did not experience any symptoms as severe as this at any point again.

Sx got worse overnight, and by the next morning he noticed additional sx of tongue numbness/tingling, so went to the ER. ER diagnosed him with allergic reaction and discharged him with a short course of steroids and Rx for Banophen.   He notes that the symptoms returned again on 4/24/21, and again this morning 4/28/21. Went back to ER on 4/24, got more steroids and sx went away. This morning bought OTC Benadryl and sx went away when he took 50-100mg.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the injection, I became dizzy and lightheaded. My  eyesight became blurry and my hearing very &#34;tinny&#34;. I felt nausea and  thought I was going to throw up. I sat down in a chair and was given a granola bar and some water. After about 3 or 4 minutes the majority of these  seemed to fade, but I still felt slightly &#34;off&#34;. Approximately 9pm that evening I felt very fatigued, so I went to bed. At approximately midnight, I woke up shivering, extremely cold, and sweating. Around 2am I had a fever of 102.3. I took some Tylenol to try to bring my fever down, which seemed to help. Around 9am the next morning my fever was gone, though I still felt extremely fatigued.  Later that evening, after several naps, I started to feel a little better. Most of these adverse events were resolved by 28 hours after injection. I had arm soreness at the injection sight that felt like having been punched in the arm for about a week after the injection.

                                                After receiving my Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine I experienced a lack of motor function in my throat. Approximately 40 minutes after having received the shot, I lost the ability swallow. A tingling sensation took the back of my throat and eventually felt as though it moved into my head. The whole experience lasted a couple of minutes. Since that time all other symptoms have been normal, sore, slight fever, etc.

I was wearing contacts and had my prescription renewed 2 days before my vaccination so I don&#39;t think my contacts are the issue. I  The discomfort feels like my eyes are having trouble focusing even though I can see fine. It&#39;s as if my eye muscles are strained. It also feels like I&#39;ve been trying to look at something very close to my eyes for a long time even though I haven&#39;t. I&#39;m not certain, but I think the discomfort is on top or behind my eyeballs. My optometrist told me to stop wearing contacts for 2 weeks and that&#39;s helped but I still have slight discomfort still, especially when driving or having to focus on near and far objects.

                                                April 9 Morning: woke up with a mild headache. April 9 Afternoon (12 pm): feeling fatigued and headache grew worse. Plus chills. April 9 (5pm): feeling very cold and tired (worse than noon) April 9 (11:30pm): This time was the most severe for me in respect to side effects. I believe my headache woke me up. The headache was so bad that my eyes hurt as well (swollen almost). I think my fever broke. I felt very ?heavy? all over. The main concern was that around midnight I was having sharp pains on the right side of my body, near where my Liver is located. That was one effect that I did not read about. The sharp pains happened once every few minutes. I considered going to the ER but wasn?t sure. I ended up just changing my shirt, got some water, and went back to bed.  April 10: My appetite was not normal, I ate but very little. The sharp pain on my right side went away but I had a minor headache for the rest of the day.

Then got the chills pretty bad as I laid down to go to bed. Became really sore all over.  Couldn?t stay asleep for more than an hour. Later in the night I started sweating and felt really hot. Also became quite thirsty. During the entire night I also had horrible dreams. After about 5am things started improving. Had some light sensitivity in the morning for a shot bit.

                                                I experienced a sudden onset of symptoms approximately 7 hours post-vaccination. Symptoms started with severe chills, elevated heart rate, fever (~102), and progressed into muscle and joint soreness, severe migraine with sensitivity to light, and strong fatigue, coupled with insomnia. The symptoms were severe enough that I considered going to the hospital, but ultimately did not. Fever, chills, and elevated heart rate subsided by the next morning (~12 hours after onset), but muscle soreness, migraine, and fatigue lasted for another 12-24 hours, along with a loss of appetite.  I am an otherwise healthy, male adult with no outstanding medical conditions whatsoever. This was one of the most severe immune responses I have ever had, including actual illnesses. I have received other vaccinations in the past and never had any response nearly as severe. I was significantly concerned for my overall health during the height of the vaccine response, and I wanted to report this to ensure that is aware of these types of responses, and can help prepare others by informing them adequately of the types of responses to expect from the vaccine. This response very much took me by surprise in terms of severity -- I had to call out of work at a critical time.

                                                This is a comprehensive neurological evaluation for a very pleasant right handed 32 year old gentleman who denies any past medical history who presents to the hospital with several day progressive visual changes and facial weakness. Patient reports he noted on Saturday that he had somewhat of a headache, he does get headaches from time to time in particular while looking at screens the television, he did have some associated blurring of his vision as well. This was not the worst headache of his life. He had no other associated symptoms. He went to bed on Saturday, he awoke on Sunday and went out to eat and noted that he couldn&#39;t form his mouth around the utensil, his face and lips and mouth felt weak. He still did have an intermittent headache and perhaps some neck pain as well at this point. His vision was still blurry. He denies any recent trauma, no car accident no whiplash no falls. He did go to an outside facility where a CT brain was performed and was normal he was told. He has noted yesterday that he could not close his eyes unless he did it manually, also he notes the way his voice sounds is different to him. He has not appreciated any weakness of his arms or legs. He is able to lift up his head off the bed without trouble. He does not think he has a hard time swallowing or breathing per se however he does describe that he is more &#34;aware&#34; of his breathing. He describes paresthesias of his face and around his mouth. No recent URI or diarrheal/GI illness, he did receive the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID -19 vaccine March 31st. Seen and evaluated in the ED with ed staff. He does report he recently ran a virtual type marathon over the course of 16 days. Clinical context and exam most consistent with that of GBS type variant (?Miller Fisher).  Treated with IVIG.  Symptoms improved after 1 dose.  4 more doses pending.

                                                Patient had standard side effects (fever, fatigue, muscle soreness) day 1 and 2 after vaccination. Starting approx. 3 days after vaccination, patient started noticing altered smell and taste, which has gotten worse in the 14 days since vaccination. Patient also has fatigue and has been experiencing weakness since vaccination. These symptoms are identical to the symptoms the patient had with COVID (starting ~3 weeks after contracting COVID and lasting over a month). The patient contracted COVID in December 2020 and had fully recovered prior to vaccination. Recrudescence of symptoms appears to be due to immunological response to the vaccine.

After receiving the vaccine at 0943 (lot # 1802070) in right deltoid,  the patient began to feel anxious.  He had been or was watching EMS working with another patient who had experienced an ADR. He began to feel &#34;floaty&#34; and noted he was blinking uncontrollably. He reported some tunnel vision/blurred vision. He states he recalled a nurse rubbing on his chest and placing a cold pack on his neck and at this point he began to feel better. He states he was trying to &#34;fight&#34; the feeling and was tensing up his extremities but denied convulsions or any loss

I felt fine the entire time and the morning of 4/6 I couldn&#39;t taste or smell.  I was given a nasal test and it came back positive for COVID.  It&#39;s likely that I contracted it from my wife before the full two weeks were up, but I thought it best to report so any information that could be helpful could be used.  My symptoms have not changed and I don&#39;t feel near as bad as after the vaccine or as my wife who didn&#39;t have the vaccine was!

CMA noticed that continued to shake arm after 5 minutes but patient was alert and oriented x 3.  CMA thought the way he was shaking his arm seemed irregular so she advised pt he would be taken to an observation area for further observation.  Half way to the observation area, pt reported to CMA that he was seeing spots and felt like he was going to get sick.  CMA called for help.  Patient experienced a syncopal event just as he made it to the chair.  Several staff was helping to support patient.  Legs were lifted to another chair.  Patient was not responsive for a short time, very diaphoretic, breathing regular and unlabored.  Patients eyes then rolled upward toward the ceiling and patient&#39;s entire body began shaking uncontrollably while staff managed to keep patient from falling to floor from the chair.  Once patient was conscious, he was able to state his name but reported he was very confused and could not think clearly.  He was able to sit upright.

                                                Could feel thickness of shot move down my arm and within 20 seconds I could feel it enter my heart. The second it entered my heart my face became numb. I was lightheaded within 5 minutes and that lasted about 30 more minutes of dizziness/lightheadedness. My left ear started ringing as soon the the lightheaded feeling started subsiding. About 2 hours later I had a small muscle cramp in my neck and the ringing stopped. My face was numb until about 2am.

                                                **Uncertain if it this is related to the vaccine** On 3/14/21, a week after vaccine was administered, I had a fast food meal I&#39;ve had several times before. Around 30-40 minutes later, I began experiencing a reaction I&#39;m not prone to.  I had severe heartburn throughout most of the night and my lips began to swell which made me mistakenly assume I have had a cardiac event. While in the morning the pain had subsided, the numbness in the lips hadn&#39;t and I went to the ER thinking it might&#39;ve been a heart issue. No cardiac condition was noted at the hospital which leads me to believe I may have had a severe allergic reaction to foods or environmentals I&#39;ve never had reactions to.

                                                I received my vaccine this morning at 6:12AM and felt fine after. Around 7:45AM I started to feel slightly short of breathe, but figured it was just from the cold outside and my Asthma. The shortness of breathe feeling goes away. Later in the day sometime after 3 PM, I start to feel as if I am getting stuffy. I take a nap on the buss on my way home, and when I wake up I suddenly feel like I am freezing and have chills all throughout my body. I get home and jump in a hot shower to warm up, but it did not help. I then heat up some food to eat dinner, and I go to drink some soda, and I notice I have no taste. I figured the soda was flat, but even flat soda has some taste to it. I then drink a Cherry Gatorade, and still no taste. Now I check my temperature and it is at 101.4, and I have a slight cough.

Pt has not found out those results as of this conversation. Pt reports not having any further episodes and feels good today.

                                                Seven days after vaccine was administered Patient started having symptoms of difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, and breaking out in a rash all over  his torso and upper arms.  His lips also got quite swollen.  The rash eventually spread down both his legs.  He was taken to the emergency room at Hospital, as he was visiting there at the time.  He was given benadryl, and prednisone once his Covid test came back negative.  Blood work, chest x-ray, CT scan of both stomach and chest, EKG and blood work all came back normal.  His resting heart rate was 120 and above, and he required two liters of oxygen to stay in the mid 90&#39;s saturation level.  He spent five days in the hospital before the rash was mostly faded on his torso and his lip swelling had come down.  He was discharged on 3/24/21 with the advice to see his primary care physician, and to be monitored carefully for oxygen saturation and heart rate.  The family could not think of anything he had eaten or come in contact with that would have caused any reaction.  At this time we think it was a reaction to his Janssen vaccine based on all the tests at the hospital coming back normal.

Went to ER for evaluation, CT scan with contrast. CT confirmed lump was swelling of lymphoid. ER thought maybe shingles, but it crosses over slightly over to the right with lesions.They determined maybe a virus and follow up with a dermatologist.  4/4/21 lesions now on left eye lid. ER visit again to ensure eye is ok, the ER dr. believes its shingles. 4/5/21 visit to dermatology and swab of lesions on face taken (still waiting on results). Dermatology believes some kind of herpes, but not sure. Went to Eye specialist to ensure eye does not have virus on same day. Eye dr believes shingles. Virus is not in the eye, but on left eyelid.

I was able to drive home 30 minutes later after making sure that all side effects subsided.  I have not experienced any other side effects from the vaccine.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, about 12:30am on 03/28/21 I felt a chills, shaky muscles around my neck/shoulders..the room temperature was at 80F but I felt cold like 35F. The next morning, I felt very tired walking up stairs from the basement to my room on the 2nd floor..barely made it to the 2nd floor, felt like my body hitting a wall/ no energy to lift my legs up. I made to my bedroom but felt very dizzy, using my hands holding myself up on my desk and realized I might faint any seconds..my vision was bright and blurry. I slowly moved myself to a bed and laid down for a while. Later that day in the late afternoon, my muscles were sore (legs, thighs, back) I could not walk more than 10-15 steps which I needed rest. These conditions lasted me for 6 days since receiving the vaccine and felt better on the 7th day. Currently I&#39;m ok.

                                                Chills and Fever the first day a few hours after injection along with Fatigue, Multi-day Headache, Slight Body Ache, and Injection Site Pain all for about 2 or 3 days.  Some leg pain was noticed the 2nd or 3rd day. And I have experienced ear ringing randomly about a week and a half after vaccination. Those may or may not be related.  Also I feel it important to note in March of 2020 (before testing was available) I experienced a very similar set of symptoms: fever, chills, fatigue, multi-day headache, body ache, 6 weeks of slight cough, leg pain, and a day a few weeks after the coughing started where I had shortness of breath. I wasn&#39;t tested back then as it was not available. But based on the symptoms I experienced, I truly believe I had COVID-19 last year prior to vaccination.
