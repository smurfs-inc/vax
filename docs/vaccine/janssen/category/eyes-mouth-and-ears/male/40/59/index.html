The next day, I woke up with general pain in the body, pain in the arm where the vaccine was injected and it swelled up a little the skin under the eyes (hives). As the day goes by, the pain in the arm has diminished, as well as the hives in the eyes.

                                                Approximately seven minutes after the patient received the Janssen COVID vaccine, he had called out to his wife/pharmacy technician at the pharmacy stating he did not feel well.  His head had fallen back and his eyes were starting to roll back into his head. Patient had saliva starting to foam at the corner of his mouth and it appeared to be the onset of a mild seizure (per wife, patient has had seizure once before after a head injury) and he was turning very pale. Patient seemed to be unresponsive at that time - not answering to questions. At this point, one of the pharmacists ran to the clinic to get help and the other pharmacist administered an Epi-pen to patient&#39;s thigh.  Patient immediately came around after the injection, looked up and began talking. Staff called 911 and patient was monitored by pharmacy and clinic staff.  When the paramedics arrived, the patient was doing better and was able to ride home with his wife.

                                                I had the worst headache of my life on 3/22 but assumed it was a migraine and treated it as such.  On 3/23 while playing hockey, nearly immediately after starting, the headache returned even stronger than on 3/22 and forced me to stop playing as I could not concentrate or focus.  The headache lasted for several days.  The following morning I went to my standard physician who immediately sent me to the ER because he was concerned about a potential aneurysm.  No cause was ever determined as the tests were inconclusive but it was suspected to potentially be a pinched nerve.  However, I never had any pain in my neck or elsewhere besides the headache.

                                                I was working at and, around 5:30 am when I felt some strong pain both side of my chest.  Sonner I felt a slight headache and from time to time it intensified to become unsupportable. At that time though about a lack of oxygenation, because I wore mask for the whole time I was working. About 9:am when I drove to home, I saw everything foggy in front of me.  When I get home I took  some paracetamol and another painkiller, because at that time my entire body was so warm, and the headache was very bad. I slept for 5 hours, when I woke up I went to the mechanic to fix my car.  While I got back during the time I saw the same foggy vision.

                                                Unusual exhaustion within an hour of the vaccine.  Had to go to bed and slept into the evening developing a fever of 103, severe thirst and chills. The fever lasted until 10:00 a.m. the following day, but weakness, thirst, chills and body aches continued for 3 more days intermittently. I would feel like I could finally exercise and then be too weak and tired to go back to routine. My appetite declined for 4 to 5 days as food didn&#39;t taste appealing. On Thursday, April 8, I announced to my mom in the morning that I finally felt like I was back at almost 100% and later in the afternoon felt nauseous, incredible pain in my chest and had dry heaves. I finally vomited some and was once again overcome by a fever of 101 and all I could do was sleep from severe exhaustion. I am against medication, but finally agreed to taking ibuprofen and tums. After sleeping into the next day around noon, I finally was able to eat some breakfast but the pain in my chest continued and I could rid it for another day. I intermittently had to sleep and gave up my exercise routine until my body has had time to recuperate. I have not fully recovered, but my appetite is picking up. I still require more sleep than normal.

                                                Got injected, didn?t hurt much. Was told to wait 15 minutes in case of reaction. They walked away and left me sitting in a chair in a public space with everyone else who was waiting. I texted my wife to check in, when I started tearing up and crying for no real reason, then started feeling nauseous so I closed my eyes.   Suddenly I felt like I had been given a shot of adrenaline out of nowhere so I?m just trying to figure out if it?s nerves or a physiological response to something. I?m trying to control my breathing but having a hard time breathing.   Then the fever hit. The most intense flash of heat. I was hyperventilating. I couldn?t open my eyes or move or make a sound, I could just sit there struggling to breathe. My phone was in my hand and I couldn?t lift it. I just simply didn?t have the strength or energy to move.   At some point I legit thought I was about to die. I managed to angle my wrist so I could check my heart rate with my watch. It was 47bpm.   I was fading away but I made myself get control of my breathing and forced myself to take long deep slow breaths. It hurt, and I felt like passing out, but I kept doing it.   Fever turned into chills and then I soaked through my jeans and T-shirt in under a minute. I was finally thinking clearly and breathing and getting oxygen. Everyone else near me was fine.   Nobody checked on me the entire time including the 3 people who sat there and watched me suffer through this.  I told the pharmacist about my reaction and asked if it was normal and didn?t receive any indication that I should be concerned, so I went home since I felt better.   It wasn?t until my friend pointed out that this sounds like anaphylaxis that I thought I should report it. So here I am. Hopefully I?ll be okay.

He bagan to make gurgling noises as if trouble breathing. His color was grey and he was sweating profusely.  911 was called by a technician and I gave one dose of Epinephrine 0.3 mg into lateral right thigh at approx. 9:40 am.  Within this period of time he began seizing. He regained consciousness prior to EMT&#39;s arriving and was brought to the hospital.

Therefore it has been a total of 7 days with ringing in both ears and it has not gone away.  It has been constant, no pulses, no frequency changes, etc.  Just constant high pitch ringing in both ears. Sometimes by inner ear feels funny, slightly tingle feeling that is related to the tinnitus.  The tinnitus is most noticeable in quiet settings, sleeping, reading, watching TV, I do not noticed it as much in office environments, listening to music, walking outside.  I have experienced tinnitus in the past after loud music band or rock concert but do not attend live loud music often and try to avoid it because it hurts my ears.  I do not have any known hearing problem, I try to protect my ears and use hearing protection often to avoid damage. When I cut my lawn I wear hearing protection, when I am working on shop floor I wear hearing protection.  I am thinking the vaccine is related somehow. I never had COVID-19 in past.  I use to be able to be in quiet settings and not have any tinnitus before vaccine.

About ten minutes after getting the vaccine, while sitting in a chair, I began to get tunnel vision and felt extremely tired. I broke out in a cold sweat all over my body. I began to lose my vision like I was fainting and I momentarily blacked out or dozed off, then came back awake. I started to get tunnel vision again for a minute, then it faded away. Then I continued sweating for a minute and then it faded away. After a couple minutes I felt fine again. I sat for another several minutes then left at 1:15 feeling ok with just a sore shoulder.

Monday morning at approximately 0230 i woke up to what i can only describe as lightning pains in my legs.  It was a very intense pain shooting from my upper thighs to my knees and slightly bending around to the top of my calves on the outside of the leg.  Monday all day i did not feel well.  Had a dull pain in center of chest, and my left arm from the shoulder blade to the elbow had what i can only describe as a slight warm sensation.  I was also very &#34;foggy&#34; and light headed.  On Tuesday the pain in my chest worsened.  My left arm kept going numb (and still does today 04.21.2021), my jaw hurt, i was light headed and again very foggy.  On Wednesday it was the same thing and I called the VA and they told me to come to the ER for evaluation.

After conferring with my primary care facility, it was recommended that I see an ophthalmologist. Confirmed that I had a Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) and recommended I meet with a retinal specialist.  Dr. confirmed the BRVO was caused by a blood clot and commenced treatment via eye injection.  I then met with my primary physician to discuss the situation.  He recommend further tests to determine whether I had other clotting.  In addition to blood work, he order MRIs of my brain, head and neck region and also recommended that I meet with a thrombosis specialist.  I met with a Dr. who ordered additional blood work for additional testing.  All tests performed to determine if I had additional clotting have come back negative.

                                                On 4/10 I started feeling tired with muscle aches.  A few days later my skin started to hurt.  Clothing was uncomfortable when it moved across my skin. Those symptoms lasted about a week. Then as they started to lessen I had some back pain (Sciatic) and a sore throat.  Also the muscles behind my eyes were slightly painful and bright lights were uncomfortable.  Then about  4/21 most of the symptoms reduced and I was feeling close to normal.  Then on 4/22 I was brushing my teeth and noticed that I couldn?t spit water like normal.  I called my GP doc and she recommended I head to the ER.   After thinking about it I also remember on 4/21 while drinking something I had some water squirt out of my lips.  At the time I thought I was just being clumsy but in hindsight the muscle weakness in my face started on 4/20.   I checked into the ER on 4/22.  When I checked into the hospital my facial weakness was very difficult to notice.  By the evening of 4/22 it was noticeable if I tried to ?show my teeth? or make a big smile. By the morning of 4/23 it was very noticeable.  The morning of 4/24 I couldn?t move my lips, nose or eyebrows.  My tongue, jaw and throat were not impacted at all.   I was started on plasmapheresis on  4/24. I had another treatment on 4/25. I noticed facial weakness was very slightly recovering the evening of 4/25.  By 4/27 my facial weakness is still healing with noticeable improvement day to day.

Within about 5-10 minutes his girlfriend comes to the pharmacy window and tells me he&#39;s feeling bad.  By the time I get to his chair he is very lethargic and slumped over.  I sit him up in the chair and his head rolls back and his eyes have rolled back in his head.   I place him on the floor and instructed my staff to call 911.   The patient presented with sweats and was unresponsive for about 10-20 seconds.   When he came to he asked how he got on the floor.   The patient never had any trouble breathing  heart rate was steady the entire time.   When EMS arrived they checked him out and was fine.  He refused transport to the hospital.  He walked out of the store after about 30 minutes from the point of his passing out.

Went to the ER and was diagnosed with Bells Palsy.  ER doctor also performed CT scan which was normal.  Was given prednisone and valacyclovir, instructed to protect and dress my eye.  The right side of my neck under my ear is very swollen and tender.  I have pain in the back of my neck on the right side.  I had a follow up with PCP 5/05/21.  She told me to use an eye ointment.  It has been two weeks and my face is still paralyzed.  Some of the swelling has gone down in my check.

They finally decided it was an allergic reaction. Gave a steroid shot and Benadryl. Sent home on steroids for 5 days. The next day had rash and itching.

The next  day the rash had mostly cleared but still a little itchy. Today the 22 I have had a really bad headache.

Approximately at 10:30 p.m., the fever increased to 104 ° F, muscle pain intensified all over the body, my teeth hurt, headache and chills. I took one (1) tablet of ACETAMINOPHEN 650MG, I took a cold bath and I put an ice pack on my head to lower my fever. I kept monitoring the temperature that at some point reached 104.9 ° F. Around 1:30 am I began to see that the temperature started to go down little by little. Around 2:30 am my temperature returned to 98 ° F and I no longer felt chills, no hot breath, neither hot ears, nor muscle pain was mild, I felt tired, headache was minimal. My last temperature was 97.5 ° F at 3:00 am. I got up around 10:30 am and I just felt tired and mild muscle pain.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after receiving the vaccination, my throat became dry and my eyes began watering. It was hard to tell but my throat felt slightly swollen also. I drank some water and a few minutes later things seemed to clear up. Randomly throughout the afternoon I had similar dry/itchy/tingling in my throat but not as strong as the time right after the vaccination. I didn&#39;t suspect this was directly related to the virus since I have allergies to grasses, trees, pollen, etc. and take over the counter allergy medicine as needed.  At 3:30am today (4/10/21) I woke up having to use the restroom and when standing up out of bed I was extremely dizzy. After laying down in bed the dizziness disappeared. When waking up later in the morning the dizziness/light headed feeling was still present when standing. I also have noticed random strange pinching pain in my legs that only last for 1-2 seconds and sends a quick short pain sensation throughout my body.    I have no clue if any of this is related to the vaccination received, but after noticing news articles with issues in a few folks receiving the Janssen vaccine, I decided I would pass this info along just in case.

I wasn&#39;t sure if I had a fever, but I did not feel well.  My wife was trying to warm me up and she thought I was having a seizure because she had never felt someone shiver so violently.  My eyes were watering abnormally as well.  The shivering subsided after about 30 minutes.  I was soar and weak over the couple of days, but I believe those are normal symptoms.

                                                I am experiencing slight ringing in what appears to be my right ear. I don&#39;t know if it is both ears. I have not seen my primary doctor yet. The feeling is similar to having head congestion or sinus pressure, I guess.  It is not an emergency for me. I will be checking with my primary doctor soon. The only discomfort I have is when I try to fall asleep. I hear the slight ringing in my right ear. Still optimistic that it will go away on its own. I am tolerating it at the moment and can work throughout the day. But, sleeping appears to be the most interruptive. With that being said, I do end up falling asleep. I am pretty sure this is a vaccine reaction. I have not had any history of it before. As soon as I see my doctor, I will update the notes for more clarity on what these symptoms are. Thank you.

Head was insanely stuffy when I woke up around 8:30, my ears hurt on the inside and I couldn?t hear well. My lungs felt kind of funny, as if I?d taken too much asthma medication. By noon my lungs were burning with every breath, my eyes were hot and weepy, the fever and muscle/joint aches had gotten really bad, and I had pain in my neck under my jaw between chin and ears.

                                                Day 1: Saturday morning March 6 at 5:00am I was shaken out of my sleep with a nasty migraine, sour stomach, intense body aches, stuffy nose, fever (102f). Classic flu like symptoms. I was extremely sick all day Saturday (level of sick: 8/10). Day 2: Sunday morning March 7 I awoke again extremely sick, just as sick as Saturday. All same symptoms (level of sick: 7/10). Sunday night I was incredibly miserable, all flu symptoms, I did not sleep Sunday night, up all night and up all day the next day Monday. Day 3: Monday I continued to be sick, all same symptoms, all day long. This time the blood shot eyes &amp; bloody nose came on, fever was steady at 101f (level of sick: 6/10). Day 4: Tuesday woke up still stick, same flu like symptoms. I feel the headache has gotten worse, in fact way worse. Fever steady at 101f all day. Overall I&#39;m not as sick except the headache and fever (level of sick: 6/10).  Day 5: Wednesday I was really hoping I&#39;d make a full recovery but still still sick, fever dropped for a few hours then came back, fever peaks and bounces around at 101f. Headache is absolutely nasty, I feel intense pain in the back of my neck and head, hard to sleep or lay down. (level of sick: 5/10). Day 6: Thursday I feel like I&#39;m just about kick this sickness, feeling way better. I dont have a fever today but I still have an incredibly nasty headache, really intense, my eyes hurt, back of my neck hurts. (level of sick: 3/10). Day 7: Friday, no flu symptoms, finally!! But the headache continues, really bad. It sort of disables my ability to function with the headache. Back of my neck and back of head hurts, inside my brain hurts. Ugh! Day 8: Saturday, no flu, no fever, although still bad headache. I&#39;ve been taking Advil all week to help reduce the headache. It helps, but after about 6 hours later the headache returns. Late in the evening Saturday my head was pounding. Day 9: Sunday headache not that bad, mild headache lingered throughout the day, tolerable. Day 10: Monday no headache!! Today was the first full day of full happiness!! *NOTE*: In July 2020 I got COVID extremely bad, spent 4 days in the ICU, couldnt breathe!! I had a fever of 103 for 6 days straight before calling 911 to come and get me. I was in bad shape, lost 30 lbs, had respiratory breathing issue for about 2 months after hospital stay. Most sick I&#39;ve ever been, total game changer, I will never be the same. To this day I feel my respiratory is at 90%, fatigue still comes around every so often. --- Thank you ---

Day 8: Saturday, no flu, no fever, although still bad headache. I&#39;ve been taking Advil all week to help reduce the headache. It helps, but after about 6 hours later the headache returns. Late in the evening Saturday my head was pounding. Day 9: Sunday headache not that bad, mild headache lingered throughout the day, tolerable. Day 10: Monday no headache!! Today was the first full day of full happiness!! *NOTE*: In July 2020 I got COVID extremely bad, spent 4 days in the ICU, couldnt breathe!! I had a fever of 103 for 6 days straight before calling 911 to come and get me. I was in bad shape, lost 30 lbs, had respiratory breathing issue for about 2 months after hospital stay. Most sick I&#39;ve ever been, total game changer, I will never be the same. To this day I feel my respiratory is at 90%, fatigue still comes around every so often.

After 15 minutes slight tingling/numbness on the tip of my tongue and slight tingling in the upper lips of my mouth. I was not worried. I took 1 Benadryl and 2 Ibuprofen (400 ml) at that time for symptoms. I took additional 1 Benadryl and 4  Ibuprofen about 6 hours later as a precaution.  Day 2 after about 36 hours I had slight soreness, and some sweating as I slept the 2nd night. Treated with 4 ibuprofen. Also I woke up with a feeling of uneasiness in the middle of the night on the 2nd night.  Day three, just a general feeling of tiredness. Day 4 and 5 still slight ache in the injection sight if pressure is applied. Other than that I feel normal as of day 5.

I fell asleep one hour into my arrival and slept for 17 hours. Up to and including today I am having headaches, pain in my legs on left side only, nausea, lack of sleep and a continued smell similar to dried blood after a injury. I have also have and continue to have shortness of breath and chest pains resulting in two panic attacks within the last three days. This has led me to report this and I have doctor visit scheduled for 4/22. I also reported today based on internet search of reactions.

                                                The vaccination uncovered an ongoing, hitherto silent infection: after a few days, my teeth started hurting, with the pain intensity increasing over two days to the point where I had to see a dentist. It turned out I had a molar that was infected and needed a root canal. The immune response from the vaccine probably caused my body to react to the tooth infection as well. I normally wouldn&#39;t put the two things together, but I had a very similar reaction a few days after my flu vaccine back in October: sensitive teeth, wandering pain in different parts of my head, neck, and shoulder area. At that time, the dentist didn&#39;t find anything (although we now know it was probably the start of that same tooth becoming infected and dying), and antibiotics took care of it.    The root canal specialist I saw, the dr, said she is seeing a number of similar cases in her patients, where vaccinations bring out undetected problems. I actually consider that a good thing - I wouldn&#39;t want to have a rotting tooth that goes unnoticed for a while.

Prior to that, I have been having some problems breathing after getting the vaccine and have been using my Ventolin  more often after the vaccine. Also noticed shortly after getting the vaccine, a feeling of liquid in my right ear.  the liquid in the ear did go away a day before the dizziness started.  Did not consider the ear or breathing issues as possible side effects  as I do have asthma and figured the ear was congestion. Not sure if the dizziness and the feeling of liquid in my right ear are related and/or related to the vaccine.

Body shaking, extreme fatigue, feverish, significant aching in upper half of body including head. Tinnitus.   After cold/flu symptoms subsided, heavy fatigue and some tinnitus persisted for 20 days. This was followed by approx. five days of tapering fatigue, after which approx 95% of symptoms had subsided. Unclear 5 weeks later if symptoms are 100% subsided, as diminished activity and exercise over three week period has left an unclear sense of physical norm (I suspect the symptoms are 100% subsided and my energy will return to normal with resumption of exercise habits).

                                                He got the vaccine, He felt as if he was breathing shallow on the bus to get to work, within 15 minutes of the vaccine.   He came home and collapsed due to the fatigue which is not normal for him.   About 12 hours later his throat got scratchy, achy but doable.  He went to work and had to leave early due to flu-like symptoms, felt feverish.   Really bad aches now, and his breathing and heart rate are elevated right now.  Achy-like headaches.   He did take some Ibuprofen 800 mg and seems to be helping.  He has had the typical soreness of getting the vaccine in the left shoulder, but otherwise ok.  He also has a stuffy nose, scratchy throat and his eyes are a little red and glassy.    He was directly exposed to somebody for 25 hours that was positive for COVID, but nobody else in the car got COVID in January.

Then, after about 23 hours after the injection, bad headache (especially around the eyes - which also caused light sensitivity) and general malaise. Shortly thereafter, low-grade fever (99.5 F) and significant muscle pain, all over the body.  The most worrisome side effect was the last one, which appeared during the second night after the injection (about 32-33 hours after the injection): extremely fast heartbeat / racing heart.   I did not use any treatments for these side effects.

                                                The patient came in for J&amp;J vaccine. He said he had no history of severe allergic reaction to anything, including meds, food, vaccines or any injections.  He said that he did not receive any other vaccine in the past 14 days. According to the patient, he did not have test positive for Covid or was in contact with anyone with Covid for the past 2 weeks. He appeared perfectly fine prior to receiving the vaccine. Once the vaccine was given, within about 5 seconds, he said that he was seeing spots, he closed his eyes and made sounds that were similar to snoring. His neck was completely down on his right side and he almost fell off his chair. I held him so he would not fall off the chair and called for help.  A few of the co-workers came to hold him. He was non responsive and my co-workers helped to put his legs on the chair. At point, I gave him an epipen. Once the epipen was given, he opened his eyes in about few seconds and became responsive. The nurses came and took over at this point.  I stayed with him and the nurses for a few minutes. The patient was fully responsive and talking by the time I left the nurses and the patient. 911 was activated after the first epipen was given.  The patient was then evaluated by EMS and the onsite nurses. The patient was AOx4 with stable vital signs.  The patient had orthostatic vital signs taken and were within normal limits.  The patient demonstrated that he was able to ambulate with no assistance.  The patient signed a refusal for transport to the hospital and was driven home by a colleague.  The patient remains in care of that colleague for monitoring.  The patient was instructed that if he were to begin feeling the previous symptoms that he is to activate 911 and be seen in a hospital.  Patient understood the instructions and went back to his residence.

                                                I received the J&amp;J vaccine on 3/24, and by that evening I had a headache, and my tinnitus was louder than normal. I had mild barely perceptible tinnitus prior to the vaccine. I would normally never notice it during the day, but lying down and going to sleep in a quiet room I would hear it. Constant high pitch but not loud, in the background more. I always run a fan in my bedroom so that I have some white noise and don&#39;t hear it. I had the flu like headache from the vaccine for two days and then it slowly started to subside into the weekend. I was tired as well from the immune response.  Five days out, I get out of the shower in the morning, and go to put underarm deodorant on, and notice my left armpit is all bright red. I check my right armpit, just as red.. Took photos of the red armpits and shared with some family and friends, as I read on the Internet that there were all kinds of crazy side effects that were possible. The red skin like rash is one of them, although my armpits never itched or burned. I could feel that they were warmer than normal, that was it. It was the 2nd day after my red armpits that my tinnitus ratcheted up to the current level that I am really unhappy with. The red armpits went away within 48 hours, never did anything about the redness, just didn&#39;t put underarm deodorant on until it passed. Sadly, the Tinnitus has remained and it is at a level that is distracting and persistent.

Patient was asked to be seated for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, because he had food allergies.  Immediately after administration, patient started complaining he felt dizzy.

I was also feeling tired and unsteady. 12 days after the shot I became very sick for 10 days with severe diarrhea, no energy,  stomach pains, weak, shaking, no more motivation.  I saw a doctor and was given antibiotics to stop the diarrhea. Now 1 month after I have no diarrhea but still get nausea and shakes . I feel very anxious and will see a therapist and prescribe medication for my anxiety that I have due to the vaccine reaction.  I took the vaccine so I can travel abroad much easier but now afraid to travel because of my symptoms.  I will get blood tested tomorrow to see if all is ok.  This vaccine is very dangerous as it has affected my DNA.

Went home and over next few days felt a little off, made regular doctor appt. follow up. Doctor said all my vitals look normal. Not sure what the cause is, had a ultra sound done of my left leg pain also. Showed no blood clots. Waiting for a heart monitor appt.   On 05/03/21 woke up at 3 am  drenched in sweat.  Still feel a little off, for no reason  . At times I feel like I might pass out.  Had epilepsy as a you child. But out grew with medications. No seizures in 40 years.

                                                Initial symptoms began with pain at the injection site and generalized fatigue.  This developed into soft tissue pain in proximity of the large and small joints which could be elicited further on palpation.  I had eye pain (left more severe than the right) which could be further elicited on palpation, headache, dizziness, chills, and an inability to feel warm.  There was also significant skin sensitivity over the trunk, scalp, and upper extremities and more in the left arm than the right.  The symptoms persisted over the second day albeit at less severity.  Presently on the third day, I am experiencing continued eye pain, mainly in the left eye and mild dizziness.

                                                Lightheaded about 5 minutes after injection. Medical team took HR and BP and was normal Took about 20 minutes and light headedness went away  Later that night at around 12:30 am, felt very cold and shivering with severe headache Did not take temperature Had a hard time going back to sleep Got up around 1:00 am to take 800 mg of OTC Advil When walking back up stairs had severe muscle pain in arms and legs Was fine after that Seemed to get better by 2 am No issues next day  About 7-10 days later developed severe frontal headaches/sinus pressure No other symptoms Used Neti Pot with saline solution and did nothing Took OTC allergy meds and Advil and did nothing  Say my primary care Dr and he prescribed Flonase, Singular and Allegra &#43; continue Neti Pot and Advil as needed Not much improvement on this regime after 3-5 days of use  About a week later developed severe pain in bottom right jaw Took OTC Advil and again no improvement Went to Dentist and said not tooth related but probably TMJD Recommend dental appliance to help with grinding  About a few days later after this jaw pain developed, developed sharp stabbing pain in bottom of left knee cap. No recollection of any insult that would cause this  All three of these pain sites were perfectly fine prior to getting J&amp;J vaccine.  No history of pain or injury to these areas prior  All of these incidents to me seem to be inflammatory/immune in nature and could be related to J&amp;J vaccine based upon how I reacted to injection.  Curious if others are seeing the same thing and if so what should be done or how long should this last?

                                                Patient was scheduled for an appointment for a Johnson &amp;Johnson  covid-19 vaccine through a drive thru Thursday April 8, 2021 @12:45pm. We arrived early and he received the vaccine at 12:15pm, waited 30 minutes for reaction and he was feeling fine. Later that same evening, the patient was driving to work on the freeway when he felt a dry throat so he coughed hard, at that cough he felt a massive pain in his head, like his &#34;head was going to explode.&#34; He immediately had tunnel vision closing in on him, so he pulled over and later woke up in our parked car with flashing emergency lights on, parked on the shoulder of the freeway. Disoriented and confused why he was there, he looked at his watch and saw he lost 15 minutes when he had passed out. MY HUSBAND COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED IF HE HAD NOT PULLED HIMSELF OVER WHEN PASSING OUT. Today we reported this to our doctors office and to you!

                                                Lost his vaccine card would not give him a new one.  He got his vaccine, had burning sensation immediately after the needle was pulled out.  About 5-10 minutes later he started sweating, and seemed to have calmed down and felt OK.  He was observed for 30 minutes there and went for observation for another 30  minutes.  He went to another doctors office and at about 15:00 started feeling light headed and weak.  He drove back home, picked up some stuff at a grocery store, and outside the grocery store in 80 degree heat he felt the need to put on a jacket as he had the chills.  he went home, went to bed feeling bad, his shoulder was still burning where he got hte vaccin.e  He had a little bit of site pain, applied topical and the pain went away.  He woke up the next morning feeling really bad, felt like a major flu, his head felt like it was going to explode, but no problem with sinuses, no cough, no sneezing.  His eyes were watering from the pain, and chills on and off.  He had to change his sheets a couple of times due to sweating.  He then developed a fever of 99 degrees at about 18:00 that night, and about 19:00 he went to 102 when he checked it.  After that it went to 103, and about 15 minutes after that it was 104, and then higher at 104.&#43;.  He took some vodka, honey and lemon juice and took an alcohol bath and the fever had not broken yet.  He called the clinic and they told him to call 9-1- 1 and to go to the ER.  He went to the ER at about 10:00, gave him fluids, did a chest x-ray and released him about midnight.  He apparently disoriented and tried to walk off and didn&#39;t remember this.  They took him back to the gate and called his son.  He went home, took another bath and woke up in sweat and was in bed for the entire weekend.  He got up Monday morning, 4/13/21 feeling a little bit better and went to see his doctor, who does not believe he was having any side effects and that the information that is being reported is true.   He is still feeling a little weak and still fatigued and on bedrest.  He was taking Advil besides his regular medicines every 6 hours with 500 mg of Tylenol for the intense pain as every joint in his body ached, and the worst headache he had ever had, as well as the high fevers.  His fever subsided on Saturday morning, and still had some sweats following that.  Did have hot/cold flashes on Saturday and Sunday.   He was given a COVID test in the ER and he was negative, but did not give him any other information regarding his lab work.

I felt very ill. I almost threw up multiple times during the day and could not move my head up or down and to the left without spinning out of control. I saw the ENT later that day and he performed the Epley Maneuver on me. I followed his directions for home care but am currently still experiencing vertigo. The doctor told me it should dissipate within one week. It has not. I have never had vertigo in the past.

Felt feverish but didn&#39;t have a fever overnight. The next day the same - general aches and pains and fatigue. Early afternoon, I took Tylenol  and at night time I had  headache and I took Tylenol again that evening (about 11:00P). Next morning, just fatigue - no more aches. Site of vaccination was more sore than initially. I had a sort of sinus headache - left side of face and head. My wife noticed I had bags under my eyes - very odd bags under eyes. I took Sudafed. Inside of my left nostril was aching. Tuesday morning, the bags weren&#39;t there but I got bad acne on the same nostril - my left nostril. It was like - I was worried that the acne was cystic  (very deep - through the nose). I haven&#39;t gotten acne in a long time. I had the sinus headache and acne which lasted two to three days. I tried nasal saline - on that Wednesday and Thursday. The acne lasted into the next week - subsided beginning on the 12th or 13th. The bagginess in eyes  had been gone by end of the 5th. Headaches didn&#39;t persist after the 7th or 8th or so.  Had trouble getting a doctor appt because they didn&#39;t know what doctor to send me to.

                                                I had previously had COVID during the first week of January 2021 and recovered.  During that time, I had lost about 80% of my sense of smell which I still have not regained.  But at time, I never has any loss of taste.  However, immediately after receiving the vaccination I noticed an altered sense of taste.  I would describe it as almost all of my sense of taste is gone but actually everything I eat has a rancid taste.  Some foods cause the bad taste more than others.  Some foods I used to love now bring out the worst after taste such as peanut butter.  The more bland the food usually results in less &#34;bad&#34; taste.  But overall I can&#39;t really taste the actual taste of any food.  And to make it worse, before when I couldn?t smell, it was bearable, but now most of the same foods that taste bad also have the same rancid odor I smell also.  So to summarize, I now can?t really taste or smell anything except for the rancid taste and odor the food has.  It is amazingly challenging as people don?t understand when I describe it to them that almost all food smells and tastes bad since that isn?t just loss of taste.  As of today, it has now been over 3 weeks since my vaccination and I don&#39;t see any improvement yet.  I did recently (about 2 week ago) have full lab work done as part of an annual checkup and all results came back normal.  So now I have reduced smell from COVID and loss of taste from the vaccine.  I don?t see any other explanation than that the vaccine caused this new phenomenon.  It could has something to do with the fact that I previously had COVID.  I am hesitant to even go to the doctor since I am certain they will have no idea what to do.

The ringing was loud enough to keep me awake, even though I felt pretty weak and achy from the vaccine.  It subsided after about a week but is still present to some extent.  I&#39;ve noticed it off and on before the vaccination, but never so steady or strong.  About one month after the vaccine I&#39;d say it&#39;s a little worse than before, but not terrible.

I have seen my family doctor - and also had an initial visit with an ENT specialist.      Current advice is to limit caffeine - and wait and see if it subsides.

I developed extreme fatigue, muscle aches, skin hurt to the touch of anything including clothing, headache, and fever 101.5.  I had to go to bed and was very weak.  I took ibuprofen and Tylenol for the discomfort.  I slept 14 hours and was able to get up at 11:00 A.M. on March 13, 2021.  The soreness at the site of the injection is not problematic.  There were other odd symptoms overnight I would awake with strange nerve like sensations tingling and itching that occurred on the bottom of the left foot, upper lip, and neck.  I also had several episodes of restlessness that was so bad that I had to stand for a few minutes before being able to lay down again.  The worst is the skin hurting and headache.  I have also had a few dizzy episodes since getting out of bed this morning.  It passes if I sit down or hold onto something.  None of these symptoms are normal for me and I cannot remember having a reaction to any vaccinations that I have received in the past.  I hope this helps with your study.

                                                I developed a high pitch ringing in the ears the morning after the vaccine.  It was noticed when I woke up.  I did have a low fever, high chills, and significant neck muscle &#34;cramping&#34; during the night when this reaction developed.  The ringing (Tinnitus) is pretty loud and bothersome.  The volume has not changed since the day after my vaccine shot (two weeks now).

She said my face was drooping, I couldn&#39;t smile or stand.  She called Ambulance.  Ambulance arrived and decided symptoms of stroke and called for helicopter to take me to medical center.   When I arrived they did CT and I was later told it showed possible areas of no oxygen to brain.  They gave me TPA drug and almost immediately  I could see improvement - my headache cleared.  Throughout the next couple hours I regained movement on right side and all functionality returned except weakness in right arm.  I stayed in ICU for 24 hours as required after receiving TPA and while additional tests were ran then was discharged on Friday, April 16, 2021

This continue throughout the weekend. I remained at home and did not have any energy to go out and be around people. The next day, I also got diarrhea and was very dehydrated.  Immediately, after I left the vaccine shot location, like within 5 minutes, I started to smell fish and my mouth tasted like salt for three days. I also had excruciating headaches that did not go away with advil. So I rested a  lot and had no real big appetite what so ever!.  Today, I am concerned that on my left side below my left clavicle, I feel a big bump what appears to be possibly a lymphatic swelling of node? I am concerned because I did not have this swelling before and do not know if it&#39;s a reaction to the vaccine.  Pls contact me via phone, this is urgent.  Thanks

                                                My dad has been experiencing what seem to be definite blood clot symptoms since the vaccine but he refuses to go to the dr. Shortly after the vaccine he experiencing stabbing headaches that came on quickly and went away in an instant. I thought they were gone after that but he later told me the stabbing headaches continue, along with horrible pain in his legs, and ringing in his ears. He told me recently that the symptoms stopped exactly two weeks later but his legs are hurting again.

Then on April 12, 2021 after working throughout the morning sitting in front of my computer, I took a lunch break.  While preparing a meal, I felt discomfort in the left eye and it became very uncomfortable. When I checked in the mirror, I discovered my left eye was filling with blood.  Upon seeing an eye doctor that same afternoon, the doctor explained that my left eye had ruptrued a large vessel and hemmoraged. However, the reason for the hemmorage could not determined because I was not under stress, had not lifted anything heavy, was not on blood thinner medication, was not constipated and have no underlying health condition.

The sound in my right ear was completely deformed, I had muffled hearing. I saw an ENT doctor,   on 04-07-2021 at 4pm and he performed an audiology test but by that time my hearing had degraded. I have cohesive hearing loss, age related and my hearing has worsened since last appointment. My symptoms lasted less than 24 hours and I did not receive medicine treatment. On the other hand, I also had secondary symptoms to my left ear, similar to what I experienced in my right ear. I experienced a pulsating drum beat hearing to my left ear and I also did not receive care or treatment. These symptoms lasted temporarily and again I did not receive any medicine for my right and left ear.

On the 6th day after my vaccine, I developed a lump on the right side of my throat which progressively got worse. I also experienced diarrhea which lasted three days. I went to see my PCP, Dr. who ordered a CT scan of my neck. The CT scan demonstrated I had an ulcer in my throat located in my larynx box. MY PCP  doctor then referred me to  an ENT doctor, Dr. The ENT doctor gave me antibiotics and a shot in my arm. My throat kept getting worse and the ENT doctor have me reflux medicine and Prednisone and Bactrum medication. Today I woke up feeling much better although the pain and swelling to my left side of my throat and ear has gone down but I still have a sore throat and ulcer and is being treated with medicine.

Approximately 36 hours after injection dizziness. 48 hours after injection neck and head pain on left side, arm soreness, and swollen lymph node on left side of throat. Minor pain in mouth and throat with fatigue and dizziness. Neck and head pain decreasing on day 3 with all other effects resolving but injection site is still fairly sore. Overall, I would say this was probably a normal response associated with my immune system reacting to the injection. I had the virus the first week of December 2020. I would classify my infection as moderate. I was sick with fever, chills and severe body aches and it lasted for 10-14 days.

                                                I had the vaccine on my left arm. I was advise of being thirsty symptom   the next day as a side effect. I got up as usual. I did my daily physical exercise routine as usual ( lift weight 80 lbs), Went to clean my face and look the mirror, and I notice I have my LEFT EYE bloody AND RED. Second day is more. I am using eye drops to remove this problem.  Never had this situation happened before and I have never had any shot for 55 years.
