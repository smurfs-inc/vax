He convulsed for around ten seconds after about two minutes of being unconscious. Four to five healthcare workers attended to him, asking him to &#34;stay with us.&#34; They called an ambulance, and the medics monitored him for awhile. Heart rate dropped to 34 bpm, clothing drenched with perspiration. Blood sugar was slightly low, although he had eaten a late brunch of two fried eggs, sourdough toast and fruit salad. The last thing he remembers is a cold sensation shooting down his arm and into his left hand. He tried to talk to say he wasn&#39;t feeling well, but he couldn&#39;t form the words, so he raised his arm and then fainted. He felt generally unwell the rest of the day, and today he is still not fully recovered.

He was cold and clammy. He never lost consciousness.  It took him a couple  minutes to &#34;come back&#34; to alertness and feel better.   Severe headache, chills starting and began asthma symptoms (wheezing) at 11;30pm the night of the injection.. 2 extra strength Tylenol did not help. He was very cold and the headache did not let up after several hours.  Eventually he had a bout of sweats and he reports he was soaked.  In the morning, at 8 am the headache was still severe...was sensitive to noise, light and touch. He was given 2 extra strength Tylenol at 8 and then 2 Advil at 10am, which finally began to reduce symptoms. He was not hungry, felt weak, and finally by late night he was feeling better.  In the morning on Saturday he awoke with a swollen left eye and blood shot in that eye.

Pt began to feel better and then patient fainted again. Pt also complained of ringing in his ears. EMS was called to the bedside where they found patient to be hypotensive. Pt was resolved quickly. Once he began to feel better he was sat up at the side of the bed and monitored for a short while. Pt no longer had any symptoms or concerns and went home with his girlfriend

For a point of reference, I can barely taste anything when I swish mouthwash around in my mouth.  Pre-existing minimal chest pain (related to history of vaping) flared up to an extreme extent the night of the day I was vaccinated. Hurt more than the joint pain or headache I also have (but those are common side effects).

His parents gave him a piece candy and drank some warm water.  He was resting on a chair crouching over for about 5 minutes and feeling ok.  I was going to call 911 for an ambulance and he refused.  He was totally fine after 15 minutes of rest.

About 4-5 hours later it evolved into a high fever (104 at peak), muscle aches on the whole body, and ringing in my right ear. The next day the symptoms were more mild, but still present (other than ringing in ear) with a lower fever, and the day after the symptoms were gone except for tenderness at injection site.

                                                Severe arm pain/low swelling in arm area. Nausea. Pain near liver area. General fatigue. Mental cloudiness. Random bouts of tinnitus in both ears, switching off, never both ears at once. The arm pain and swelling in shot area lasted about two days,  but the nausea, ;over pain, and fatigue continued for the better part of 4 days after the shot. The tinnitus only happened a couple times about 1-3 hours after the vaccination then ceased. I did not get this verified by a doctor, but I suspect my liver pain was related to an inflammation in the liver associated with the vaccine, as in the past, pain around my liver area has been associated with inflammation of my liver during minor flare ups.

He did not respond to me calling his name.  Pt gained consciousness and was a little frightened, not understanding the situation or remembering where he was at.  He felt a little better after some water.  About 4 minutes later, he said he was losing his vision and seeing flashes of light. He was told to lie on the floor with his feet up. Within a few minutes,  he said he was feeling a lot more like normal.

                                                Patient was given vaccine and was told to wait in the monitoring area for 15 minutes post vaccination. Shortly after, the patient reported &#34;feeling pale&#34; and was told to remain seated. The patient then fell over from the chair and lost consciousness. We immediately called 911 and went to the patient&#39;s side with epinephrine. However, he recovered within seconds and was able to sit up and drink water.  He reported feeling &#34;pale [...], weird [...]&#34; and said he felt like his &#34;ears are sweating.&#34; He did not want epinephine and remained seated and responsive. When asked, he said he had never received any adverse reactions to any vaccines in the past. A pharmacist then cleaned and disinfected his right temple that was bleeding, which he seemed to have hit when he fell. He later reported feeling chest pain and slight difficulty breathing but did not want epinephrine at that time. Emergency services arrived about 20 minutes after and assessed the patient and removed him in a gurney.

His mother said this has never happened to him before. When he recovered he was disorientated and complained of blurred vision. He later said he thought he fell asleep. It is unknown if this is related to the vaccine. We took his pulse (apx 50 bpm) and gave him water. We called 911 and the paramedics evaluated him in the ambulance.

He said his vision turned black, felt dizzy. His breathing was normal, but blood pressure dropped. During the 2 min observation time, his breathing was fast at some point. He said he wasn&#39;t nauseous. He asked for water. I gave him some warm water. He finished the whole cup of 6 oz of water.  We continued to monitor his blood pressure every 2-3 min. His blood pressure was going up every time we checked. He continued to ask for water, and he drank another cup of warm water. After about 10 min, he felt better and able to walk without dizziness.

Blurred vision around 29 hours after vaccine - advised to go to ER by triage nurse. ER doctor determined not to worry about, likely due to headache but not 100% sure.

                                                patient was in the observation area when his family told us that the felt dizzy. i got to his side and asked if he was doing ok but did not get a response. he was sitting on a chair with eye opened but not responding. so we called 911. then a few seconds later , he said i could hear you but was not able to see. then he said he felt hot so we gave him some water. Now dispatcher on the phone told us no water and have him lay on the floor. by now he  had started to feel a lot better. then the parametic team came and took over . His vitals, blood sugar and EKG were all normal. then patient was offered to go to hospital for evaluation but he refused

                                                Patient received Janssen COVID19 vaccine (LOT#201A21A) in his left arm at approximately 14:43 on 5/25/21. During the 15 minute observation period, he expressed &#34;I don&#39;t feel well&#34; and endorsed dizziness/ lightheadedness, slight tingling feeling in fingers, and nausea. Shortly thereafter at approximately 14:50, he started to slouch and appeared faint while sitting in a chair with eyes closed. He did not fall or hit any part of his body. He was easily aroused with a touch on his arm and responded to verbal questions immediately. He denied trouble breathing, chest pain, palpitations, headache, muscle weakness, vision changes, skin reactions, swelling. He was oriented x3 and not exhibiting verbal or swallowing problems. His vitals were normal- HR 80 bpm and BP 105/80 mmHg. He was offered a receptacle to vomit in if needed; however, he did not vomit. This initial reaction was consistent with potential vasovagal reaction/ near-syncope after vaccination.   Patient was encouraged and instructed to sit on the floor to prevent injury in case of fall but he refused. Staff offered him water, a fan, and opened windows while monitoring.   Later while waiting for a ride at around 15:10, he endorsed headache (first above his eyes and then toward the back of his head) and clarified this did not feel like a typical migraine that he has had before. Then at around 15:20 he endorsed vision changes in his right eye- he could not see a portion of vision out of that eye except peripheral vision and described not being able to see writing on the right side of a whiteboard in front of him in the room. Later he described a resolution of that gap in vision but then had blurry vision out of that eye. He denied any vision changes in the left eye.   Due to alarming symptoms of vision changes and onset of headache, patient was recommended to go to ER for further observation and evaluation. He was not in urgent distress and patient did not wish for EMS to be called but agreed to go to ER when his emergency contact picked him up.    Patient&#39;s emergency contact came to pick up patient at approximately 15:40 and was recommended to take him to the ER. Patient and emergency contact were amenable to this plan. He was able to stand up and walk to the car without issues.

Pt did not lose consciousness but blacked out (visual disturbances, tinnitus/temporary hearing loss, nausea) occurred within 2-3 minutes of administration. First attempt to read BP was low (~80/60). Pt is an athlete, so I waited until after water was consumed to take BP again. 2nd reading was ~106/65. Pt felt better after drinking water and after sitting for 15 minutes under observation.

                                                I got the injection then went and sat down in a chair at the back of the room and started getting light-headed about 3 minutes after I sat down, so I called a nurse over. Then the inside of my chest started getting really hot and my vision started going white in both of my eyes, it took about 10 seconds for me to completely lose vision. Then I passed out, I have no idea how long I was out for but when I came too I had a sort of epileptic-type seizure but I do not know how long it lasted. I woke up completely disoriented, had no idea where I was at and had a severe cognitive dysfunction. I still have moments where I just can&#39;t follow or complete a thought or just kind of go blank.

I went to bed early that day around 10PM. Woke up around 1:30AM on the 4th. Felt terrible and took my temperature. It read 101.5. Got up to use restroom and when washing hands, everything started to go blurry, I thought i had just become lightheaded and that it would pass so i stood there leaning against the bathroom door.I  ended up fainting and hitting my head on the cabinets. I was completely soaked in sweat.  An hour later we drove to the ER to make sure everything as okay. IV was started, some test performed, and fever was gone by 5AM. Felt completely fine after going home and resting for a few hours.

                                                The patient (self) felt a soreness around the site of the injection begin immediately and grow throughout the day. The soreness continued to at least April 12 (at the time of this report). The soreness was immediate unlike a tetanus shot but the pain the following days was 2-3 times less that of a tetanus shot. By 4pm the same day, the patient felt fatigue and tired and had difficulty staying awake. Around 6pm the patient took 200 mg of ibuprofen by mouth because of a strong headache. At 7pm the patient was experiencing the following: headache, warm head to the touch, shivering/shaking,  fatigue, mild aching. The patients pulse was consistent 100-104 bpm. The patients temperature at 8:30pm was 100.4 F. The patient then went to bed at 9pm. Patient had trouble falling asleep due to fever, shaking, aching. The patient slept intermittently until midnight. At midnight, the patient noticed the fever and shaking had ceased but the headache and aching were still strong. The aching was all over the body. The patients eyes hurt to move. The aching was constant and at times was throbbing. At 3am the patient could still not sleep well so he took 650 mg of Acetaminophen by mouth. The patient began to notice some relief approximately 30-60 min after. The patient fell asleep after the relief began and slept soundly til 9:15 am, April 11th. The patient awoke feeling much better. All side effects had stopped with the exception of a feeling of weakness and slight dizziness. The patient was able to carry on normally and took no more medications.

                                                I took a nap after around an hour of receiving my shot at around 1:40pm. Once I awoke at around 6pm, I had irritated eyes, extreme nausea, extreme dizziness, insatiably low body temperature, extreme shivers, migraine because of my head uncontrollably shaking, and dry mouth. I felt like I was in 20 degree weather and nothing I could do would heat my body up. My body grew so tired from the uncontrollable shaking that I could not get out of bed to get my phone to call 911. Every symptom I was experiencing was not mild and was to the level of extreme. This lasted until around 9am. I have been slowly recovering since then (currently almost 9pm) and feel only 70% back to normal.

Within 30 seconds of vaccine, patient reported dizziness, narrrowed vision, and diaphoresis; he also appeared very pale.  As we attempted to assist him to the floor, his eyes rolled back and he lost consciousness. Patient became alert within 10 seconds of losing consciousness. When safe, he was assisted to WC and taken to clinic where he was observed for a few hours. Patient discharged home with his mother when he was feeling better.

                                                Patient was administered the Janssen COVID vaccine at 403 pm. I returned back to the pharmacy to prep his partner&#39;s vaccine and when I came back at 405 pm, he was loopy with his head swaying. He wasn&#39;t responding to verbal communication by his spouse and me nor through touch as I shook his shoulder. He then lost consciousness and so I lifted his head to check for breathing and pulse which he had. I asked my technician to call 911, and asked my other tech to help me transition him to the floor so we can raise his legs to provide blood flow to his head. Mid-transition, he had a seizure. We brought him completely to the floor and just as I was about to turn him to his side, he regained consciousness. Pupils were dilated, breathing normal, pulse elevated. He also was able to speak immediately and confirmed feeling &#34;okay&#34;. I then had my technician remain outside with him laying on the ground as I returned back inside the pharmacy to call management and my technician was still on the phone with EMS. Paramedics and management arrived within 10 minutes upon which patient was then taken to the hospital. Wife followed and we rescheduled her vaccine.

                                                About an hour after the shot, I began hearing a faint ringing in my right ear.  It is very low volume, but it is there.  It now occurs about every 2 hours and the ringing lasts for only about 15 seconds before going away again.   This does not happen in my left ear.   The tone of the ringing is equivalent to a C4 on a piano.  It is not harsh, and sounds like a synthesizer tone.

It appears to be concentrated in my left ear, although it&#39;s hard to tell. There&#39;s a consistent high-pitched tone that won&#39;t go away. I&#39;m not entirely sure when it started (maybe 24-36 hours after receiving the vaccine), but it&#39;s gotten slightly worse since then and is more noticeable. I have not been able to go to the doctor yet.

I immediately went over to him, at which point I noticed he was sweating profusely and stated he felt a little light headed. Less than 1 minute afterwards, he stopped talking and his eyes began to roll back, at which point his upper body began to slide over to once side as if he was going to fall. I immediately caught him, motioned for someone to call emergency services  and continued to call him name. He did not respond, was pale and blacked out for about 30 secs. He was still breathing thankfully. When he regain consciousness, he stated that he felt better but he felt some tingling sensation in his forearms bilaterally. Thankfully at this point emergency services were present and upon taking his vitals, realized that his HR and BP were significantly low for someone of his age.

He was then responsive again and said he has blur vision and feeling hot in the ears.  Ambulance was called when pharmacy staff noticed his reaction.  He was awake and oriented x3 according to paramedics, bg 109, bp 77/57.  He was then taken to the hospital via ambulance.

At 3:44pm the patient was waving at me indicating that he felt dizzy so I ran out there and he asked for ice and said he was feeling lightheaded and seeing black spots.  I asked him to lay on the floor with his feet elevated in a chair. He stayed that way for a few minutes and said he was feeling better, and we were able to get him a cool pack.  He sat up on the floor and put the cool pack on his neck.  After a few minutes he was feeling better so I allowed him to remain seated in the chair until 4:10pm.  Store management came to get a statement from him and he ended up staying in the pharmacy area for approximately 1 hour post-vaccination.  He waved and thanked us when he left.

                                                Worst headache I?ve ever had (8 out of 10 pain scale), could not sleep due to the headache, very lightheaded, entire body ached (could barely move), eyes hurt, highest fever temp 102.8, nausea (at times I thought that I may have to puke). These symptoms lasted all night, but felt better in the morning. These symptoms were like COVID but x5. When I had the COVID-19 virus, my symptoms were not as bad as yesterday?s adverse effects from the vaccine. At 3 AM, I was considering going to the hospital and I have never been hospitalized before. I could barely open my eyes since the headache was so bad.

                                                Began feeling delirious around 7:00pm - uneasy and strange. Upon walking to the subway station, I felt overwhelmed with sudden depressive thoughts and anxiety.   On the Subway, I had a very severe, and disturbing panic attack. My vision became blurred and distorted, my heart rate spiked, and I became nauseous and extremely frightened. I sat down to try to maintain a sense of calm - but got off the subway after a few stops and met with a friend whom I had texted, to take care of me. From the point on, I was very shaken and agitated, and have been since the event.    I have never experienced anxiety, depression, or any such symptoms in my life before, nor was I nervous or anxious about having received the vaccine. The onset of the event was sudden, and seemingly out of nowhere, without real purpose, hence my conviction that it may have been spurred as a side effect from the vaccination.  I went to Urgent Care Sunday morning, April 11th, the morning after the event. My resting pulse was 97 BPM (normally 52-54) - and my blood pressure much higher than normal - 175/110. The doctor insisted I go home &#34;and relax&#34;.    I still feel uneasy and shaken from the event.

On April 3rd he had non-specific changes in his hands that he attributed to cold weather that led to discomfort when running them under warm water. By monday APril 5th he was having worsening sensitivity in his hands and feet to heat, touch and experienced numbness. he also began to have difficulty walking. He went to the ER April 6th and was discharged April 7th after undergoing MRI of the brain and spinal cord, labs and lumbar puncture, with a presumptive diagnosis of early Guillain-barre Syndrome. His symptoms continued to worse, loss of gait was more pronounced as well as loss of balance and new off sensations in his tongue. He was admitted to the hospital, continued to undergo diagnostic workout. Results from tests on APril 6th came back positive for Anti nuclear antibodies and high protein in his CSF. He was treated with 3 days of infused Immunoglobolin therapy and was discharged on April 11th with a diagnosis of likely GBS. His symptoms continue to worsen slightly, but with less day to day decline

Went to bed around 10:30 and woke up about 3 hours later at 1:30. Had chills and was shaking when I got up. Could not really fall back asleep. Chills turned into a fever. That morning I started to get a headache. I sounded congested at one point, but no runny nose. I also had body and joint aches.  I took Excedrin three times that day. Once in the morning, once in the afternoon, once before bed. I used zquil to sleep a little bit in the afternoon and again at night. I woke up Sunday and felt completely fine except for my arm still being sore.

                                                A week and a half approximately after the initial vaccination of the J&#43;J covid vaccine I started having a course of strange symptoms. Insomnia, inability to focus on things directly in front of me (a hand in front of my face would go out of focus automatically after a second), blurred vision, short term/long term memory loss, severe emotional issues, difficulty breathing, anxiety. Shortness of breath at a certain point was so bad I thought I was not going to make it. One very troublesome symptom that culminated after weeks of 4 hours of sleep was that my brain started feeling &#34;funny&#34;. The best way to describe it was a brain &#34;orgasm&#34; which I have never experienced before. At the same time I experienced dry heaving for several minutes, and severe shortness of breath. After this experience my symptoms gradually improved over the next week or two. Prior to this it felt like my brain was not getting enough oxygen/blood, which could have been feeding my insomnia. When I would try to sleep, I would wake up at 4 am gasping for air, as I felt like my breathing was labored when sleeping. I could not focus on my computer screen to do my job at home. Large amounts of melatonin seemed to help my brain feel better and get some rest. I took hydroxyzine for unrelated reasons prior to the vaccine injection as needed, however not too often. During  March I did not take it, as I had experienced disruptions in circadian rhythm due to the medication. I feel it is possible I had a blood clot that has been described in the news, although now there may be no way to know for sure. I talked with  my primary care physician about this, and he did not think this was the case because I was male. However I have a BMI of 18.7 and some issues females have such as TMJ and inability gain weight/anorexia diagnosis when younger. I also was recently diagnosed with an only recently described actual medical issue called R-CPD, which is the complete inability to burp or belch. I felt like during the time when I experienced the side effects, that this condition was heightened (bloating/loss of appetite). I lost quite a bit of weight during March, I usually weigh 135-140, and was down to 115 at a certain point. I am now back up to 130.   I now take sertraline at 1/4 pill dosage to treat the anxiety I experienced as a result of these symptoms as well as some other personal issues. I experienced severe side effects from the sertraline taking it at full dosage, and still experience some at 1/4 pill dosage.

                                                Patient stated they didn&#39;t feel well at all and was sweating.  I told him I should give him an Epi Pen, but he preferred receiving generic Benadryl. At approximately 12:50pm he was given 50mg of diphenhydramine since he wasn&#39;t having any swelling to inhibit swallowing. He drank half the bottle of water. He stated his vision was spotty, but getting better. I told him we should give him the epi pen and call 911.  He asked us to call girlfriend to let her know he wasn&#39;t feeling well. After another few minutes he stated his vision was getting better and feeling much better. At 1:12 we took his blood pressure 102/67 pulse of 47.  He stated the pressure and pulse were normal for him since he is a runner.  (He had run a marathon the previous weekend). He was monitored for 30 minutes.  After the 30 minutes, he felt fairly normal and was going to be with someone the rest of the day working at home. He was given more benadryl and advised to seek emergency medical attention if symptoms returned and were worse. Around 7;30pm I called to check on him. He had taken another dose of benadryl 50mg.  He still felt comfortable not seeking er attention since he was going to be with friends the rest of the evening and night.

                                                Thursday 4/8: 3:20pm: COVID injection given in right arm  Friday 4/9: ~1:00 am: woke up shaking with chills and severely cold; had slight headache. Had insomnia all night.   6:00 am: woke up with bad headache, slight fever.   7:00 am: got out of bed and had vertigo and was running into walls trying to walk to my living room, along with the worst migraine I?ve ever had. Also had dizziness, nausea,  chills, 100&#43;degree fever, aches, skin sensitive to touch, and severe tinnitus. All of the veins were visibly popping out of my head.   As the day went on, everything got worse. Any time I moved, my head would throb so bad that I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital.   3:45 pm:  the headache started to finally go away. It would only hurt if I moved fast. At this point my fever was only slightly high, about 99 degrees. I was still unstable when I walked and dizzy. I went from being super cold, to being super hot and sweaty. And I was alternating between cold &amp; hot and sweaty for the rest of the night. Was also having some memory issues, repeating things when I was having a conversation with someone over the phone.   I was sweating all night when I was sleeping.   Saturday 4/10: 7:00am: woke up with a slight headache; still out of it and dizzy.   8:00am: after being awake for about an hour or so, I looked in the mirror and my whole face (around the lips, cheeks, and jawline, and under the eyes) was really swollen and puffy. My face was even mis-colored. Under my eyes was purple and yellow, and my cheeks were white.   Some confusion persisted throughout the day as well as dizziness.

The chills and muscle pain were extremely intense 6 hours after I received my vaccine. I could not stop shivering, or get warm enough. That would be followed by a feeling that I was too warm and I would begin sweating profusely. I also experienced a few additional side effects I could not find listed:   I felt especially sensitive to stimuli as if normal sensations were heightened (e.g. hot water in a shower felt painful, running fingers through my hair felt like I was having my hair pulled, I kept my eyes squinted because the sunlight through the windows felt too bright.)  I was extremely irritable and became extremely frustrated easily. I mean frustrated to an embarrassing degree over small things that didn&#39;t matter. It was inconsistent with my day-to-day temperament. It felt like an adrenaline rush came in response to the most minor of inconveniences.

                                                VASOVAGAL: The patient stated he wasn&#39;t &#34;feeling good,&#34; he felt very dizzy and his vision was blurry, he was sweating as well. I immediately grabbed another chair and raised his feet above his heart level. He immediately stated that he was &#34;feeling better&#34; and his vision was improving. I then offered him a cold bottle of water. He appeared very stable within a few minutes. We did call 911 as a precaution, they arrived a while later and deemed the patient was stable and their additional services were declined by the patient. I insisted the patient stay and finish the bottle of water. All together I believe the event was about 30 - 35 minutes before leaving. I encouraged the patient to drink plenty of fluids and electrolytes and to take it easy for the rest of the day.

                                                In the span of about 40 minutes following the shot, I had severe reactions. I initially felt really warm in my arm and my heart started to race for a bit. That subsided pretty quickly. Then I got really dizzy, lightheaded and warm and sweaty while waiting the 15 minutes. Then my vision started to blur and I felt tingly in both of my hands and both of my legs. According to others with me, I also went grey. I was given a cool cloth and fanned which helped with a lot of the issues. I also had my legs elevated and was given some slightly sugary food and drink to help the vaccine disperse better. Paramadics and amabulance arrived to assess me. I was improving by the time they arrived and was deemed stable, so I did not go to the hospital for this incident

                                                I had the expected side effects for about two days after the vaccine. A week later I started to have pain and tightness in my jaw. I waited about a week and the pain seemed to be spreading into my face. I started to have a headache after that and consulted my doctor. The headache and pressure in my sinuses and cheeks has been persisting for eight weeks. It happens intermittently and some days it seems to come on later in the day. The tightness in my jaw has gone away and it is a nagging headache now. When I run it seems to be a slight tightness in my sinuses. I have been using some Allergy medication and they only hep a little.
