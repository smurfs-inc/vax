                                                Patient about 3 minutes after receiving vaccine felt light headed, vision blurred, and felt like he was going to black out. Pharmacist had patient get down on floor to bend knees and get them above heart level and he started feeling relief. Patient quickly recovered.

Pt began to feel better and then patient fainted again. Pt also complained of ringing in his ears. EMS was called to the bedside where they found patient to be hypotensive. Pt was resolved quickly. Once he began to feel better he was sat up at the side of the bed and monitored for a short while. Pt no longer had any symptoms or concerns and went home with his girlfriend

For a point of reference, I can barely taste anything when I swish mouthwash around in my mouth.  Pre-existing minimal chest pain (related to history of vaping) flared up to an extreme extent the night of the day I was vaccinated. Hurt more than the joint pain or headache I also have (but those are common side effects).

At 3:44pm the patient was waving at me indicating that he felt dizzy so I ran out there and he asked for ice and said he was feeling lightheaded and seeing black spots.  I asked him to lay on the floor with his feet elevated in a chair. He stayed that way for a few minutes and said he was feeling better, and we were able to get him a cool pack.  He sat up on the floor and put the cool pack on his neck.  After a few minutes he was feeling better so I allowed him to remain seated in the chair until 4:10pm.  Store management came to get a statement from him and he ended up staying in the pharmacy area for approximately 1 hour post-vaccination.  He waved and thanked us when he left.

On April 3rd he had non-specific changes in his hands that he attributed to cold weather that led to discomfort when running them under warm water. By monday APril 5th he was having worsening sensitivity in his hands and feet to heat, touch and experienced numbness. he also began to have difficulty walking. He went to the ER April 6th and was discharged April 7th after undergoing MRI of the brain and spinal cord, labs and lumbar puncture, with a presumptive diagnosis of early Guillain-barre Syndrome. His symptoms continued to worse, loss of gait was more pronounced as well as loss of balance and new off sensations in his tongue. He was admitted to the hospital, continued to undergo diagnostic workout. Results from tests on APril 6th came back positive for Anti nuclear antibodies and high protein in his CSF. He was treated with 3 days of infused Immunoglobolin therapy and was discharged on April 11th with a diagnosis of likely GBS. His symptoms continue to worsen slightly, but with less day to day decline

                                                Patient stated they didn&#39;t feel well at all and was sweating.  I told him I should give him an Epi Pen, but he preferred receiving generic Benadryl. At approximately 12:50pm he was given 50mg of diphenhydramine since he wasn&#39;t having any swelling to inhibit swallowing. He drank half the bottle of water. He stated his vision was spotty, but getting better. I told him we should give him the epi pen and call 911.  He asked us to call girlfriend to let her know he wasn&#39;t feeling well. After another few minutes he stated his vision was getting better and feeling much better. At 1:12 we took his blood pressure 102/67 pulse of 47.  He stated the pressure and pulse were normal for him since he is a runner.  (He had run a marathon the previous weekend). He was monitored for 30 minutes.  After the 30 minutes, he felt fairly normal and was going to be with someone the rest of the day working at home. He was given more benadryl and advised to seek emergency medical attention if symptoms returned and were worse. Around 7;30pm I called to check on him. He had taken another dose of benadryl 50mg.  He still felt comfortable not seeking er attention since he was going to be with friends the rest of the evening and night.
