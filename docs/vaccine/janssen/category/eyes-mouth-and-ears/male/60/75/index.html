                                                I had some fatigue the first couple of days but nothing that kept me from going to work - just took it slower and easier those days. The tinnitus started on 19th - ear pain on the right ear. I woke up that morning, I had pain. When I touched it I had pain on the front of my right ear.  ( It appears to be coming from my right ear.) I took some Zyrtec D to see if that would help me and I took that for two days and that seemed to help but then the ringing started. I notice it more at night when it&#39;s quiet or when I&#39;m working myself doing my maintenance work at rental units. I thought it was clogging of ear and so I was going to go to the doctor but I did ear drops and flushed for two days. It didn&#39;t subside anything with the ringing - I might be able to hear a little better. I don&#39;t have pain anymore as to the touch but I still have the tinnitus - the ringing in the ear - that constant sound. It has been continuing it seems to not be as bad but others it is. When I go to bed or when I wake up at night the ringing there it&#39;s hard to go back to sleep. I have an appt with the Ears, nose and throat doctor. My hearing doesn&#39;t seem to be affected, but I can&#39;t say for sure if it&#39;s any different - I&#39;m left handed so I use my left ear in the phone.

                                                abdominal aches and cramps gradually increasing in severity; walking and other core body movement provided temporary cessation of increasing severe pain;  the peak of severe pain was accompanied by a bowel movement, followed within about 5 minutes by body temperature increase, sweating, and profuse salivation such that saliva was swallowed every 2-3 seconds for a few minutes.   Treatment was a focus on breathing while practicing the turtle yoga position (forehead on floor with knees folded under abdomen) and then laying flat on back with one or both knees bent.  After 10-15 minutes of this treatment the symptoms (abdominal pain, high temp, profuse salivation) subsided.

Patient reported to emergency department around 10 pm that day (4/9)- says tongue began swelling since 7pm, he took a benadryl at 8pm with no improvement. Per ED physician, patient had &#34;tremendous amount of tongue swelling, I am not even able to visualize the palate he has fullness to his left neck as well&#34;. Patient intubated in emergency room to protect airway.  Patient admitted to ICU where he is still today (4/13). Per chart, the edema subsided on 4/12 and patient was extubated today (4/13). Patient received IV steroids from 4/9- 4/13 (discontinued this morning).  Of note: patient does take lisinopril 20mg daily (start date July 2020). There is concern the angioedema was caused by this medication. Patient received tranexamic acid and Berinert in the emergency department to assist in treating this potential etiology.

                                                On day 4 after the Vaccine was administered, I felt a burning in my throat about the size of a dime. On day 5 the burning feeling was in my entire throat.  I was treating this like a Acid Reflux problem.  On day 6 the burning was there and I was also having an issue with my sinus.  There was blockage at times and other times a lot of mucus was coming out of my nose.  I also developed a cough.  I now started treating it like a head cold.  I took day and night cold remedies.  This continued for 8 more days without relief.  On day 9 I did have a 100.5 fever that went away while I slept throw the night.  I contacted my doctor and was able to see his PA.  I was tested for COVID19 and given a prescription for Doxycycline Hyc 100mg.  My COVID19 results were &#34;None Detected&#34;.  I&#39;ve taken 4 of my prescription pills  and haven&#39;t noticed a change.  I still have an Earache, sensitive left cheek bone, mucus coming from my nose and coughing.  The amount of coughing and mucus has lessened but the earache pain has not diminished.  I also have a bad headache this morning, 16 days after my vaccine was administered.

                                                For the first time ever, I had what I determined (based on internet searching) to be an ocular migraine.  My vision was distorted in both eyes, although the distortion was stronger when looking to the left.  There was a circular area that was fuzzy and a bit wavy like looking through water.  The circular distortion area seemed to be outlined by a ring of brighter light. No flashes or floaters.  I did not have a migraine headache then or afterwards; I&#39;ve never had a migraine headache.  I followed the on-line advise and laid down and did try to use my eyes for about an hours.  The distortion faded within an hour or two; it has not recurred.  I did not connect it to the vaccine as a potential source at that time.

                                                The Jansen vaccine was given on 3/18/21. Patient began to experience symptoms of bells palsy on 4/6/21. Patient noted  R hemibody numbness, which began with right-sided facial numbness when brushing teeth. He was evaluated by his PCP (no exam noted) and initiated on Bells Palsy regimen of doxycycline 100mg BID, acyclovir 800mg TID, and prednisone 40mg. On 4/9, a referral to neurology was made after pt returned to clinic w/ burning deep low back pain that radiates up to his shoulder, and his b/l temples.

At this time again only L sided facial weakness noted (documented as reduced ability to close eyelid, raise eyebrow, weakness puffing out check, and reduced smile on L), no other weakness, drift, or sensory findings. Pt was instructed to continue doxycylilne 100mg BID 10d course (4/6- 4/15), prednisone 40mg 7d course (4/6- 4/12), acyclovir 800mg TID 7d course(4/6-4/12).

                                                For the first two weeks, there was only mild headache and fatigue.  But on day 12 (or 13) following the shot, my husband had severe abdominal pain and black, tarry poop.  He passed out on the toilet in the middle of the night and hit his head, woke up in a puddle of blood (from hitting his head) . He was severely lightheaded, short of breath, could not walk.  He had to crawl back to bed.  He continued to have severe  lightheadedness, shortness of breath, muscle aches, abdominal pain, and also ringing in his ears.  He called me early Saturday morning and told me what happened and that he called out from work.  (We do not live together. He is 280 miles away because of his job.) That man has called out sick only one time since I&#39;ve met him in 1998; so when he told me he did not go to work, I knew it had to be really bad.  I drove up there ASAP the same day, and I took the pulse oximeter with me.  His oxygen levels were all over the place.  They were usually better (like high 70s to low 80s) while he was lying down.  When he would sit up or stand up, the number would plummet, reading so low I thought he was going to die. One time his finger was so cold that it took me 4 tries to get a reading.  It read at 55, but I realize that might be because his finger was too cold.

                                                The day after the vaccine I was working and later in the day I started to feel dizzy. Within an hour and a half I could not stand up and I was very dizzy. My coworkers said my eyes rolled back in my head. The ambulance transported me to the ER and my Blood Pressure was at 80 Systolic. I was given fluids and I was discharged after five hours. I still couldn&#39;t work the next day and I was still really tired for the rest of the week. It seemed to take a couple of weeks to feel normal but the fatigue was extreme for the first week after the episode of dizziness. I have two autoimmune diseases and a history of blood clots so I might not have gotten the Janssen vaccine if the risk was known. The blood thinner I was taking at the time might have helped but my blood pressure on discharge was still only 110/60.

                                                The afternoon after receiving the vaccine I had a job interview at 1:00PM EST and I wasn&#39;t certain I could make it because I felt a little off. I drank a bottle of water that was offered and I started feeling lightheaded and worse. As soon as I stood up, I thought I was going to fall so I sat back down. I waited around for about an hour before leaving. I stood up and felt a little better, but still a little off. I felt okay enough to drive and went to my interview. Once I got to the building, I had no clue how I got there. I completed my interview and remember leaving the building and sat in my car for a long time. I don&#39;t remember how I got home. I walked into my apartment and I lay on my bed and didn&#39;t wake up until the next morning. In the morning I went to my kitchen and grabbed more water. My ears started hurting, my head starting hurting and I felt off. I called and made an appointment with Dr. and informed her that I did not feel right. She wasn&#39;t sure if my feeling was from the vaccine or if it was a sinus infection. She gave me vancomycin 160mg capsule and tobramycin 20mg capsule. I feel that the shot is what messed me up. I felt like someone stuck a pencil in my ears. I felt like I wanted to sleep all the time. I also had chills in 65 degree weather. I had to have the heat on in my house. I&#39;m still feeling a bit of pain around the injection site.

I could not focus my vision and tried to vomit also also but immediately went to bed. Throughout the day/night when i got up I was unable to walk/see as normal and required my hand on the wall for balance. I also felt nauseated and could not eat anything during this time. I was able to sleep mostly and as of this submittal(04/13/21 7:51 pm CT) i have been symptom free for several hours. No medical treatment was sought due to no health insurance. All symptoms indicate stroke .

                                                Patient states he received J&amp;J vaccine on 4/1; on 4/10 he had nonradiating persistent low back pain. A few days after that (on 4/13) he felt numbness and pain in his legs, in addition to ?decreased sensation in his inner thighs. These sensations were migratory and intermittent. Also noted in his upper extremities as well. He also had issues with temperature sensation in his lower extremities. On 4/14 he had slight haziness in vision while driving which resolved after 30-60min and has not recurred. He also had slight difficulty walking. On 4/15 he had an appointment with his PMD; had L-spine XR which revealed moderate lower lumbar facet arthritis, and was thought that change in sensation was likely d/t radiculopathy - was prescribed ibuprofen, muscle relaxant, oxycodone (took oxy x1, ibuprofen for a few days). Since then he has also had intermittent stabbing pains in various parts of his body which resolved spontaneously. On 4/17-4/18 his back pain resolved. On 4/18 at 4:30am he woke up with R-sided facial weakness. He has not had focal weakness aside from the face.  Was seen in ED that morning for this R-sided facial droop involving the forehead, diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy and given prednisone/valacyclovir. Yesterday 4/19 around mid-day he started having L-sided facial weakness and slurred speech. This has progressed since yesterday. Reports ability to swallow, though a little difficult d/t cheek weakness. Low back pain has returned as well. Does report constipation and possible poor bladder emptying for the last few days.  He was seen by a Doctor and referred to ED to rule out AIDP and other diseases after J&amp;J vaccine.

I got headaches, those have also continued since the 13th.  The following week my mouth began to hurt, I started coughing more than normal. First a dry cough, now I&#39;m coughing up phlegm with specks of blood. And I can not stop itching, and I&#39;m getting tired of taking benadryl for it. I contacted my doctor, all I got was these are normal reactions to the vaccine. They last 2 to 4 weeks. I already get migraines, my gut is picky since that shot. I used to eat hot peppers, now if I use pepper on my dinner my stomach is in pain. These side effects should be gone by now. I am one pissed off person.

Pronounced fatigue set in within 3 hours after injection and I was in bed the following 2 days. Mild, continuous ringing in the ears began on day 2. By day 4 was back 100% to a normal routine.  The only remaining symptoms as of the date of this report are the mild, continuous ringing in the ears and the small, yet noticeable swelling of tissue around the base of the left pinky finger.

March 28, noticed a lack of muscle control on the right side of my lips while drinking from a straw. This time I was admitted as a possible stroke. Two different MRI sessions revealed no stroke. They performed a lumbar puncture and discovered that I had extremely high protein levels. After having been admitted, for the next couple of days my face slowly lost the ability to close my eyes fully and a complete lack of control of my lips (total paralysis on my face). I also began to experience bouts of stabbing pain throughout my body and weakness in my limbs. After the after th

                                                Patient passed out after receiving janssen covid-19 vaccine. There was no injection site reaction, no wheezing, or rash/hives. Patient had vision loss, dilated pupils, sweaty, unable focus or respond to use questions being asked, and  was having trouble hearing-said he had ringing in his ears. We were able to lay him on the floor without injuries-he did not fall. I was fanning him and we were talking to him. He got a little worse but then got better. When he was better, he said that he had passed out before when having blood taken. He did not mention this to me before the vaccine was administered. I do not feel that the Janssen COVID shot was the cause, I think he just passes out from injections or needles. We did call 911 when he was getting worse. By the time they got here, he was better but they did check him.

Received J&amp;J vaccine at 3 weeks ago. His current neurological examination and clinical history is suggestive of GBS  NEUROLOGICAL EXAM:  MSE: A&#43;Ox 3 Language: no aphasia   CRANIAL NERVES:  2nd CN: bilateral pupils are equal round and reaction to light, visual field-full 3rd,4th and 6th CN: EOM-I 5th CN: no sensory deficite 7th CN: face: symmetric, not able to smile or blowing air or holding water 8th CN: hearing loss: no 9, 10th CN: no dysarthria, palate movement:normal 11th CN: no neck weakness 12th CN: tongue: middle, no atrophy   MOTOR EXAM:  Tone: normal  Strength: 4&#43;/5 at bilateral UEs, 4 Pt symptoms started very early. Narrative from family below:  &#34;Day 1 (The day he took the vaccine): My father was complaining of very heavy chest pressure (said he felt like his chest was being pushed down with force.) He felt really tired and had a nasty headache.   Day 2 He began to feel tingles in his legs and arms. Said he felt sore and had mild pain around his back, feet, legs, hands, and arms. The headache came in and out.   Day 3 He began feeling more severe pains in both legs &#43; headache. More tingling around his face, lips, and jaw.  Day 4 Severe pain continued around his entire body. Had an episode where he lost vision from 1 eye (he described it as blurry vision) felt like he was going blind from one eye.  Day 5 Could barely stand on his two feet and could no longer go to work. He stayed in bed and then hospital visits began. My mom took him to emergency for the first time.  I was able to get details of the location where he was vaccinated and onsite contact information. The info is below:

                                                Janssen shot on Mar 12, 2021. On Mar 25,2021 at 10 AM, I woke up with a headache, sore joints, nausea. Also blurry vision and inability to read words on a page. Sensing something wrong, my sister drove me to emergency room at Hospital where I was admitted. I was later told I suffered a stroke. I was in the hospital for 5 days, receiving various tests. (Hospital has all info on record).  I am awaiting surgery to remove blockage from carotid artery. Doctor has all my information and should be reporting the event also to VAERS.

I returned his call and he verbalized all issues above and also said his legs, arms and hands were cramping up and having ringing in the ears.  I recommended him to go to the ER now, he said he had called his PCP and was told the same thing.  He stated he is single and lives alone and does not drive.  I told him to call 911 and he verbalized he is too embarrassed to do that and states he will wait for his daughter to call him.  I offered to call his daughter for him and he declined.   Addendum: Created by RN. 04/16/2021 02:01 PM 04/16/2021 Client called reporting the same symptoms as in 4/13 message -- I told him to go to the ER immediately. He stated he could not drive due to muscle spasms and feet and leg pain. Asked if he would please call 911 and stated that was not necessary. He verbalized he understood my directions and stated he would go to urgent Care. Called Sheriff office to make a well person check.

                                                Woke up the following morning (1 AM) with fever, chills, and considerable discomfort. This subsided by morning. The following day I began seeing swelling, redness, itching and burning of extremities (mainly the hands, but also feet, ears, face). These symptoms seem to be triggered by the slightest exertions, but have also exhibited without physical activity. These appear to be getting more prevalent each day.

                                                I experienced extreme vertigo on the in the middle of the first night after the shot. When rolling over in bed from flat on my back to my left side my body felt like it kept  moving when I had in fact stopped. It feels like I am rolling out of a hammock. Right side has the same sensation. Also happens if I bend over when standing. It is not always accompanied with dizziness. Severity increased over a few days, then gradually decreased over the next 5 days or so and is now increasing again. I HAVE NEVER HAD THESE SYMPTOMS IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. My pre existing tinnitus has grown very much louder. I have had occasional low pain / pressure deep in my sinuses.

I was checked by an ENT doctor, had a hearing test, they did not found anything wrong and all my tubes were clear and all points out that it is related to the J&amp;J vaccine.  My hearing varies from day to day, other times of the day it gets louder.  On Thursday 04-29-2021, it will be 6 weeks since I last got vaccinated.

I talked to the Dr online and he told me take Zinc Sulfate and Hydroxychloroquine; nebulized a medication but I can&#39;t remember what it was. I got pretty sick for about three days. I got to the point that I was so weak I could hardly move. I went to  ER and was there for 1/2 day. They gave me IV fluids. They said that my lungs still sounded good The illness ran it&#39;s course of about 10 days. I still feel winded two months later.  I have a little nagging cough yet. I can still go to work though.

                                                My tinnitus is worse on right ear, gotten worse than on my last visit.  My tinnitus had not gone away. I I went to see my doctor who ordered  MRI of the brain and ears with and without contrast. My MRI was negative, nothing abnormal. Also did a full hearing test, other than normal range of hearing loss.  The tinnitus is more variable, louder than it was, get periods of quietness.    I have noticed that my tinnitus gets louder during exercise. I can not find rhyme or reason that my tinnitus gets quieter and louder.  I have no problem for the CDC to contact my PCP to help with my diagnosis.  I also had severe nose bleeds, which have subsided now.  My skin rashes are also gone and get treated with topical creams.  Before my vaccine, I had oily skin and now I noticed my skin started to get dry, along with tinnitus, and also dry skin on my scalp.  When I get dry skin I apply topical lotion.

                                                At approximately noon on May 9, 2021, I observed that I was having some difficulty with hearing in my right ear consisting of a &#34;blocked&#34; feeling with some distortion  I have had occasional issues of this nature previously which have normally been rectified by &#34;over the counter&#34; products.On the afternoon of May 12, 2021, there had been no improvement, so I sought assistance at the facility located in town. Personnel there initially attempted to &#34;flush&#34; my ear without any improvement. I was then seen by a Dr. who was on duty at the facility  Dr. indicated that there appeared to be some sort of plastic &#34;tube&#34; in my ear. Dr. indicated that this was best handled by a specialist in the field, and provided me with the information on a local practice.  I was seen on May 18, 2021 at the offices of facility located near a Dr. I explained to Dr. what Dr. had seen  he located the item and removed it from my ear. This item has not, as yet, been identified  Dr. initially speculated that it may be part of a hearing aid, which I have NEVER had.  I subsequently saw Dr. again on June 1, 2021, as the issues were persisting. At that time, a &#34;Hearing test&#34; was administered by a ophthalmologist. Dr. prescribed a course of 50 Prednisone (10 MG tablets) to be taken as follows at breakfast time: Six tablets for the first six days Four tablets for the next two days Two tablets for the next two days One tablet for the next two days Dr. reasoning at that time was that he believed that the vaccine may have provoked some sort of &#34;immune deficiency&#34;. He advised that I should see him again in two weeks for a further hearing test/consultation.  I completed the course of Prednisone on June 13, 2021. I underwent a further hearing test with ophthalmologist on the morning of June 15, 2021 as agreed  prior to the test, I indicated to ophthalmologist that I expected the results to be, to all intents and purposes, identical to the previous one: this proved to be the case. I subsequently indicated to Dr. that the Prednisone had been, from my perspective, totally ineffective. He is, at the time of writing, unable to offer any explanation for the issue or &#34;path forward&#34; from it: I am presently seeking a second opinion.

                                                Bells palsy is what I got two weeks later - on the left side of the face. All way from forehead to chin. Including the ear which is actually the worst part. It hurts. I went to the doctor on 6/11/2021 and was given  steroids for a week. It helped with the ache in my neck and ear but once I was off the steroids all that came back. They didn&#39;t help with my face. Bells Palsy takes months to heal - so I didn&#39;t notice any healing on face. Ibuprofen and Tylenol OTC for pain is what I&#39;m currently taking.

                                                I woke that Friday and the bottom half of my right eye was full of netting, within a week entire eye was like that, so about 50% of those optical nerves are permanently dead. Saw Dr. on 05/26/2021. Doctor said My blood supply to eye was restricted, right eye, to the point most of my optical nerves died. I also feel pressure in my head behind my eye. Turns out I also developed a sty. This head pressure on right side of head is killing me. My back and neck are also very sore.

                                                I experienced after my vaccine, after a few days I had a runny nose, head cold and I thought it as hay fever.  At the end of my day it would clear up, my runny nose was back again. On the next morning I also experienced sore throat and a runny nose. This lasted about one week.  I went to my PCP, and they did a COVID test and I tested positive.  I can not taste anything, my nose is not runny and I have to blow up a few times a day. I have no fever 96.7F. I also get a minor phlegm when coughing.  At this time I can say my symptoms are a bit better when taking OTC Tylenol medication though I still can not taste anything.   I am taking fluids and taking Tylenol for my Covid symptoms.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included blood pressure.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805020, expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 08-APR-2021 between 09.30 and 09.40 to left arm for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) for blood pressure. On 08-APR-2021, 20 minutes after vaccination, the patient started having symptoms. The patient&#39;s heart started aching and that lasted for 15-20 minutes and then went away. On 09-APR-2021, the patient had chills that had lasted for four hours. On 10-APR-2021, the patient could not move his neck left or right and back of his head felt like it was swelling and  tender; he also had a headache, and he was extremely sleepy. The patient&#39;s neck and head tenderness lasted three to four days. On 11-APR-2021, the patient eyes had blood shot and were red and reported that he might had a stroke or blood clot. On 17-APR-2021, he had a knot came up in the center of right arch on foot. On 19-APR-2021, at the time of this report, the patient&#39;s eyes were still red and had a slight headache; the patient&#39;s neck still hurts, he was sleepy, and the knot was still there on his right arch of his foot. The patient took acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) but he was already taking that for his blood pressure. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from heart ache on 08-APR-2021, head swelling and tender on 14-APR-2021, and chills on 09-APR-2021, and had not recovered from neck hurts/could not move neck, bloodshot in eye/eyes were red, headache, sleepy, and knot in center of right arch of foot. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 64-year-old African American (non-Hispanic/Latino) hypertensive male patient reported &#34;heart aching&#34; 20 minutes after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The event lasted for 15-20 minutes.  Other associated symptoms developed in the succeeding 3 days: chills that lasted for hours, could not move his neck and felt it was swelling and tender, headache, sleepiness, blood shot eyes.  Nine days after vaccination, the patient reported he had a knot in the center of arch right foot.  The patient took Aspirin.  No other details was reported.  The event is confounded by the underlying hypertension.  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

The patient&#39;s height and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included pollen allergy. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 1805029 expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported. 1 total, administered on 16-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination on left arm. Concomitant medications included atorvastatin and lisinopril; both for unknown indication.  On 07-APR-2021, the patient experienced cerebral venous thrombosis, hypoaesthesia, and visual impairment. The patient had cerebrovascular thrombus with partial loss of sight and numbness of his left arm.  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from cerebral venous thrombosis, hypoaesthesia, visual impairment. This report was serious (Disability Or Permanent Damage).  This case version (1) was created on 30-APR-2021 for the purpose of quality improvement the following corrections were made. The MAC was added for the pharmacovigilance narrative.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V1: This spontaneous report was received from a health care professional via VAERS (ID: 1207958) and concerned a 64-year-old male of unspecified race and ethnicity who experienced cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) 22 days after vaccine. Concurrent conditions included pollen allergy and concomitant medications included atorvastatin and lisinopril. Twenty-two days after vaccine, the patient experienced CVST, hypoaesthesia, and visual impairment. The patient had cerebrovascular thrombus with partial loss of sight and numbness of his left arm. Specific imaging and laboratory results, including platelet count, were not reported. Information is limited in this case, and the occurrence of CVST could represent background incidence of such events in the general population. The platelet count is not reported and thus this case does not meet the Brighton Collaboration (BC) definition for Thrombocytopenia Thrombosis Syndrome (TTS) with BC Level 5 (not a case of TTS.)

Then I started to get a severe headache that was pretty constant. After multiple days, my face became paralyzed. I also experienced severe fatigue. This was over 10 days. Once paralysis happened we went to the Medical Center. I was treated with IVIG for many days and oral steroids. I was in the hospital for 6 days. I also experienced my BP spiking. I had an abnormal EKG. I&#39;m still unable to chew properly. I was told that now I have Encephalitis and GBS (Gillian Barres syndrome).

                                                April 20, 2021. PT needed to use the restroom.  We stopped, he walked to the restroom, I went to the gift shop. Upon returning, I saw PT sitting on a bench. He was leaning to his left, could not see out of his left eye, very unstable when sitting. We missed lunch, so we thought it was his sugar dropping. I started to feed him jam and a chocolate bar. After 2 hours, his vision returned &amp; he seemed better. He drove us back to the rental cabin. He rested the next 2 days.  Then on Friday, we packed up our vehicle and Pt drove us back home. After arriving home, Pt&#39;s condition got worse. We went to the Dr, explained the events of the previous week &amp; she came to the same conclusion, Diabetes spell. His condition continued to worsen, we went back to Dr several times, the ER 2 times and finally we got into see a Neurologist. That appointment, the doctor said he thought stroke. Dr scheduled a MRI for June 1, 2021. Results of that MRI was a definite stroke. Now he has started outpatient rehab with no promise he will ever regain full mobility. He can no longer drive, mow grass, walk without a cane and help, etc. Life has changed dramatically for both of us.

                                                About a half hour after I had received the J&amp;J vaccination which was after I had left the vaccination site and was headed home I noticed that my right eye was impacted  by some kind of outline that looked like a spider or cockroach in black lines. The position shifted in light and based on where my eye was pointing. So it could be at the top or side of my view. This ghost image has been there ever since the vaccination.  I notice it every day.  My primary care doctor left his position and I haven&#39;t got a new one.  My wife spoke with her eye doctor who did not see my eye.  The doctor said that it was most likely caused by a bubble.  I have been able to deal with this distraction even though it has remained the same since it appeared.  I  became more concerned that a booster shot for the J&amp;J might make my situation worse.   I also wasn&#39;t sure if I would have to have the J&amp;J injected for the booster or could have a separate booster shot.

I went to see my optometrist who told me I had some sort of allergic reaction. I do not know if the vaccine caused my allergic reaction. My optometrist prescribed eye drops. I had no soreness or pain to my left arm after myvaccine.  Today I still have some clear, thick discharge that is present.

His eyes were rolling in the back of his head, which this symptom would come and go.  He would have hallucinations.  On unspecified date Pt woke up screaming the house was on fire and there was a dog by the bed and a person in the closet, talking out of his head.  An ambulance came and brought him to ER.  Pt coded in the ambulance and brought back. Pt was coherent upon arriving to the ER.  He had to be intubated and bagged and died about 15 minutes later.  Pt had blood work which was totally out of whack.   Family was told they did not understand what had happened to him.  The only thing the family could think of that was different was he had recently been vaccinated.

                                                2 weeks  ago on April 17th,  I woke up feeling very dizzy and nauseous. The room was spinning. My left ear was ringing, My balance was off.  Every time I bent over it was worse. I vomited after I ate.  Spent the day and the next day in bed. On Monday I called my doctors office and explained how I was feeling  and a tele visit was scheduled later in the day. During the tele visit,  the doctor diagnosed my symptoms as vertigo. I never had vertigo in the past. She couldn&#39;t tell me if it was from the vaccine or not. She did mention she had patients complaining of vertigo after getting the covid vaccine. Medication and exercises were given to me.  A few days later, my big toe on my right foot was aching terribly.  Each day it seems to be worse and I am at the point where I can barely walk.  Today I did some research online and saw that it could be gout. I never had gout n the past. I read vaccines can cause gout.  So here I am 2 weeks since my symptoms began and I am still dizzy and have the toe pain. Exercises and medication is not helping.

Could also be related to ADD med( Vyvanse have been taking for last 10 years)- as med causes spike- high blood pressure.

                                                It&#39;s difficult to say when I first started with this adverse reaction but it was at least 3 months ago.  I have experienced uncontrollable itching since then.  I have also lost my taste/smell for many foods such as coffee, hamburgers, hot dogs, snacking chips/dip, and normal smell of meat cooking.  I experienced a low grade fever (100.6) and chills on the night of March 19 (date I received the vaccine shot) and March 20, 2021.  I don&#39;t like to go to the Doctors&#39; but I see that I have been seeing the doctors over 11 times since I received the J&amp;J vaccine shot. I am miserable with the itching and it seems that I am very anxious now.  The itching occurs mainly at night all over my body--and lately, it has begun to itch on my forehead and face.  It is all over my body.  I thought I should get this information to you in case someone else is experiencing it.     I began my quest to stop this itchy feeling with my primary doctor.  She prescribed hydroxyzine 50 mg.  I take 1 pill every 6 hours as needed for anxiety.  She also ordered buspirone 10 mg 1 pill 2xday but it makes no difference so I will not refill it.  I told my doctor that I would go to a dermatologist next for relief.  That&#39;s how I began going dermatologist.  So it has been since around March 30, 2021 that I have been trying to stop the uncontrollable itch.  Just not sure if the vaccine caused this problem but I highly suspect that it did.

                                                Patient was administered the Johnson and Johnson Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.  Shortly after, a few seconds, the patient stated he felt flushed and head started to fall back. Staff member cradled his head and called another staff member over.  Staff member called 9-1-1.  Patient went unconscious and his eyes rolled back for approximately 30 seconds.  When aware, we (staff members) transferred patient from the chair to the floor where staff member supported his back and fanned him due to his profuse sweating.  Staff member continued talking to him when he became unconscious again, this time gasping for air and turning pale.  We kept saying his name until he came to again and was somewhat aware of his surroundings.  He fainted one last time.  After this time, he sat up on his own and seemed to be very coherent.  The EMS arrived shortly after and took over.  They said they would take him out to check him out but he seemed to be doing better.  An EMS personnel let us know the patient did tell him that he has fainted from vaccines before.  However, he did not disclose this to us on the PQCF form or when asked verbally.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included covid-19 (experienced all the typical symptoms, but waited 13 days to get tested) and concurrent conditions included paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (last time he had an episode until after he received the vaccine). He did not have any recent episodes of atrial fibrillation The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805018, and expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 total, administered on 29-MAR-2021 to right arm for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 29-MAR-2021, the patient experienced occasional localized pressure and headaches in occipital, frontal, and temporal areas which were intermittent and pulsating in nature. On APR-2021, the patient experienced small amount of blood in stool and had irregular, less frequent and more solid bowel movements about 2-3 weeks post vaccination. He mentioned around the same time he was urinating more (increased urination lasted 2-3 weeks), and then his bowel movements and urinations became regular again. He also experienced a nodule that appeared in the cubital fossa area on medial side of his arm two weeks after the vaccination and then gradually resolved over 2.5 weeks after it appeared and small amounts of blood in his phlegm which appeared 1.5 weeks post vaccination and he continued to experience this on week 2, week5 post-vaccination and then resolved. On 14-APR-2021, Laboratory data included: Antibody test (NR: not provided) Negative, Complete blood count (NR: not provided) unknown, and Platelet count (NR: not provided) Normal. He reported experiencing 5 episodes of atrial fibrillation within the 7 weeks after vaccination, a diagnosis of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was confirmed by his cardiologist. He also experienced fatigue about 5-6 weeks after vaccination. He had intermittent waves had fatigue throughout the day which lasts for an hour and then came back later in the day, with no consistency and stated this was still unresolved. (Later on he stated he had no fatigue spells lately and considered this resolved). On an unspecified date, he experienced feeling or sensation of drainage in left nostril, (even though had no excess blood or fluid) which started a few weeks after received the vaccine and then lasted for several months but now resolved and occasional pressure in both ears (opening and closing his mouth did not relieve the pressure) and slight high pitched sound in the his left ear. His ear side effects came and gone and considered them to be resolving but not fully resolved. He noticed a few weeks after vaccination he had slight burning sensation in just his lower lip with small, tiny protrusions (He initially said this was unresolved, but then later said this was resolved). He also experienced localized back pain bilaterally inferior to the posterior rib cage but mostly on the left side. He mentioned he have a checkup next week and will discuss his concerns since this side effect was still unresolved and headache. The patient stated he did not experience any of these side effects before receiving the vaccine. He was generally healthy and tried not to take medication if possible. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from  paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, nodule in cubital fossa area on medial side of arm, feeling or sensation of drainage in left nostril, slight burning sensation in just lower lip with small, tiny protrusions, and fatigue, and small amount blood in stool, small amounts of blood in phlegm, irregular, less frequent and more solid bowel movements, and increased urination lasted 2-3 weeks on APR-2021, was recovering from occasional pressure in both ears, and slightly high pitch sound in left ear, and had not recovered from headache, localized back pain bilaterally inferior to the posterior rib cage but mostly on left side, and occasional localized pressure and headaches in occipital, frontal, and temporal areas.

                                                About 7pm I started feeling terrible chills and headache. by 10pm I had extreme body aches, bones , muscles, etc.  Headache was very intense,eyeballs ached ,face etc. I was dizzy, jaw was stiff but mostly terrible pain. had some wheezing by it went away when I coughed up mucus. Had a 101.5 degree temperature all night which went down to 100 in the morning and back up to 101.2 later on the 14th.  I had nausea and extreme pain all over my body and restlessness.  it got a little better the next day but still feels like I have the flu. I had covid back in march of 2020 and was tested for the antibodies at the end of August.  There is a horrific dearth of research on people who have had covid and whether they should get the vaccines. It is disgraceful, and the next time I will listen to my gut which told me NOT to get vaccinated!

                                                Patient and wife stated that he has had many vasovagal syncope events when he has had vaccines administered, both more recently, and in the past. The patient was seated in a chair with arms.  Within a couple of minutes of administering the vaccine, his eyes rolled back in his head, he broke out in a cold sweat, BP was 75/55, pulse 55.  He never stopped breathing (was snoring); epinephrine for an anaphylactic reaction was not indicated.  I offered to call 911 multiple times but his wife said this was the normal course of his reaction and held an icepack on his neck for the duration.  After 5-10 minutes the patient was once again responsive.  He sat for an additional 10 minutes and then said he was ready to leave.  His wife walked him out of the store.

                                                I experienced 3 strokes consecutively. First one came when I was sitting in the couch and they took me to the hospital. They took me in and we stayed there for about 2-3 days (Can&#39;t focus) and then they dispatched me. I was pretty messed up. Then I spent like the next 2 weeks with micro strokes. I didn&#39;t know what was going on and went back to the hospital only for them to send me back home. Shortly after that, I saw Dr. and told him that I wasn&#39;t feeling well and went home. At about 4 o&#39;clock I took a shower and didn&#39;t feel well. My wife drove me to the hospital and when I went I couldn&#39;t do anything. I got shots for strokes and took me to a bed. That is where I stayed and saw Dr. who told me that I got a stroke. I stayed there for 3 days and they sent me home. By now, I have lost my eyes, speech and it is really hard to focus or remember everything. I was going to a speech therapist and walk funny. I was stumbling at home.

                                                Pt received vaccination around 9am on 3/18. Started having lip swelling next day and presented back to the pharmacy on 3/19 around 1:15pm. Pt states he was having no tongue swelling or any other symptoms, just swelling of the lower lip. We administered 25mg of benadryl and kept an eye on him in pharmacy for 15 minutes and he said he was feeling fine and would check back with us. Pt is an associate so pharmacy is keeping an eye on him.

Patient didn&#39;t know what other words to use to describe it. He said he was not coughing it up, but didn&#39;t know where it was coming from. I asked if it could possibly be from his gums and he said yes. It was coming from the upper part of his mouth and it was a thick, dark red blood. It was not bright red. He stated that it would congeal together and then become big enough that he would want to spit it out and this had been occuring throughout the day yesterday and into today. He reports no other loss of blood, dizziness or other symptoms. I requested patient reach out to his physician to discuss this matter.
