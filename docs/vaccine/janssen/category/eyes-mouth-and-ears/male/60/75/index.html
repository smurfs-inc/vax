                                                I had some fatigue the first couple of days but nothing that kept me from going to work - just took it slower and easier those days. The tinnitus started on 19th - ear pain on the right ear. I woke up that morning, I had pain. When I touched it I had pain on the front of my right ear.  ( It appears to be coming from my right ear.) I took some Zyrtec D to see if that would help me and I took that for two days and that seemed to help but then the ringing started. I notice it more at night when it&#39;s quiet or when I&#39;m working myself doing my maintenance work at rental units. I thought it was clogging of ear and so I was going to go to the doctor but I did ear drops and flushed for two days. It didn&#39;t subside anything with the ringing - I might be able to hear a little better. I don&#39;t have pain anymore as to the touch but I still have the tinnitus - the ringing in the ear - that constant sound. It has been continuing it seems to not be as bad but others it is. When I go to bed or when I wake up at night the ringing there it&#39;s hard to go back to sleep. I have an appt with the Ears, nose and throat doctor. My hearing doesn&#39;t seem to be affected, but I can&#39;t say for sure if it&#39;s any different - I&#39;m left handed so I use my left ear in the phone.

Patient reported to emergency department around 10 pm that day (4/9)- says tongue began swelling since 7pm, he took a benadryl at 8pm with no improvement. Per ED physician, patient had &#34;tremendous amount of tongue swelling, I am not even able to visualize the palate he has fullness to his left neck as well&#34;. Patient intubated in emergency room to protect airway.  Patient admitted to ICU where he is still today (4/13). Per chart, the edema subsided on 4/12 and patient was extubated today (4/13). Patient received IV steroids from 4/9- 4/13 (discontinued this morning).  Of note: patient does take lisinopril 20mg daily (start date July 2020). There is concern the angioedema was caused by this medication. Patient received tranexamic acid and Berinert in the emergency department to assist in treating this potential etiology.

                                                On day 4 after the Vaccine was administered, I felt a burning in my throat about the size of a dime. On day 5 the burning feeling was in my entire throat.  I was treating this like a Acid Reflux problem.  On day 6 the burning was there and I was also having an issue with my sinus.  There was blockage at times and other times a lot of mucus was coming out of my nose.  I also developed a cough.  I now started treating it like a head cold.  I took day and night cold remedies.  This continued for 8 more days without relief.  On day 9 I did have a 100.5 fever that went away while I slept throw the night.  I contacted my doctor and was able to see his PA.  I was tested for COVID19 and given a prescription for Doxycycline Hyc 100mg.  My COVID19 results were &#34;None Detected&#34;.  I&#39;ve taken 4 of my prescription pills  and haven&#39;t noticed a change.  I still have an Earache, sensitive left cheek bone, mucus coming from my nose and coughing.  The amount of coughing and mucus has lessened but the earache pain has not diminished.  I also have a bad headache this morning, 16 days after my vaccine was administered.

                                                For the first time ever, I had what I determined (based on internet searching) to be an ocular migraine.  My vision was distorted in both eyes, although the distortion was stronger when looking to the left.  There was a circular area that was fuzzy and a bit wavy like looking through water.  The circular distortion area seemed to be outlined by a ring of brighter light. No flashes or floaters.  I did not have a migraine headache then or afterwards; I&#39;ve never had a migraine headache.  I followed the on-line advise and laid down and did try to use my eyes for about an hours.  The distortion faded within an hour or two; it has not recurred.  I did not connect it to the vaccine as a potential source at that time.

                                                Patient states he received J&amp;J vaccine on 4/1; on 4/10 he had nonradiating persistent low back pain. A few days after that (on 4/13) he felt numbness and pain in his legs, in addition to ?decreased sensation in his inner thighs. These sensations were migratory and intermittent. Also noted in his upper extremities as well. He also had issues with temperature sensation in his lower extremities. On 4/14 he had slight haziness in vision while driving which resolved after 30-60min and has not recurred. He also had slight difficulty walking. On 4/15 he had an appointment with his PMD; had L-spine XR which revealed moderate lower lumbar facet arthritis, and was thought that change in sensation was likely d/t radiculopathy - was prescribed ibuprofen, muscle relaxant, oxycodone (took oxy x1, ibuprofen for a few days). Since then he has also had intermittent stabbing pains in various parts of his body which resolved spontaneously. On 4/17-4/18 his back pain resolved. On 4/18 at 4:30am he woke up with R-sided facial weakness. He has not had focal weakness aside from the face.  Was seen in ED that morning for this R-sided facial droop involving the forehead, diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy and given prednisone/valacyclovir. Yesterday 4/19 around mid-day he started having L-sided facial weakness and slurred speech. This has progressed since yesterday. Reports ability to swallow, though a little difficult d/t cheek weakness. Low back pain has returned as well. Does report constipation and possible poor bladder emptying for the last few days.  He was seen by a Doctor and referred to ED to rule out AIDP and other diseases after J&amp;J vaccine.

                                                Patient passed out after receiving janssen covid-19 vaccine. There was no injection site reaction, no wheezing, or rash/hives. Patient had vision loss, dilated pupils, sweaty, unable focus or respond to use questions being asked, and  was having trouble hearing-said he had ringing in his ears. We were able to lay him on the floor without injuries-he did not fall. I was fanning him and we were talking to him. He got a little worse but then got better. When he was better, he said that he had passed out before when having blood taken. He did not mention this to me before the vaccine was administered. I do not feel that the Janssen COVID shot was the cause, I think he just passes out from injections or needles. We did call 911 when he was getting worse. By the time they got here, he was better but they did check him.

I also experienced chills,, fatigue for the first two days.    I still continue with skin rashes, eczema on my face and scalp and nose bleeds.    I have been seeing my ENT and PCP at this point since I still continue with symptoms.

Received J&amp;J vaccine at 3 weeks ago. His current neurological examination and clinical history is suggestive of GBS  NEUROLOGICAL EXAM:  MSE: A&#43;Ox 3 Language: no aphasia   CRANIAL NERVES:  2nd CN: bilateral pupils are equal round and reaction to light, visual field-full 3rd,4th and 6th CN: EOM-I 5th CN: no sensory deficite 7th CN: face: symmetric, not able to smile or blowing air or holding water 8th CN: hearing loss: no 9, 10th CN: no dysarthria, palate movement:normal 11th CN: no neck weakness 12th CN: tongue: middle, no atrophy   MOTOR EXAM:  Tone: normal  Strength: 4&#43;/5 at bilateral UEs, 4 Pt symptoms started very early. Narrative from family below:  &#34;Day 1 (The day he took the vaccine): My father was complaining of very heavy chest pressure (said he felt like his chest was being pushed down with force.) He felt really tired and had a nasty headache.   Day 2 He began to feel tingles in his legs and arms. Said he felt sore and had mild pain around his back, feet, legs, hands, and arms. The headache came in and out.   Day 3 He began feeling more severe pains in both legs &#43; headache. More tingling around his face, lips, and jaw.  Day 4 Severe pain continued around his entire body. Had an episode where he lost vision from 1 eye (he described it as blurry vision) felt like he was going blind from one eye.  Day 5 Could barely stand on his two feet and could no longer go to work. He stayed in bed and then hospital visits began. My mom took him to emergency for the first time.  I was able to get details of the location where he was vaccinated and onsite contact information. The info is below:

Also blurry vision and inability to read words on a page. Sensing something wrong, my sister drove me to emergency room at Hospital where I was admitted. I was later told I suffered a stroke. I was in the hospital for 5 days, receiving various tests. (Hospital has all info on record).  I am awaiting surgery to remove blockage from carotid artery. Doctor has all my information and should be reporting the event also to VAERS.

I returned his call and he verbalized all issues above and also said his legs, arms and hands were cramping up and having ringing in the ears.  I recommended him to go to the ER now, he said he had called his PCP and was told the same thing.  He stated he is single and lives alone and does not drive.  I told him to call 911 and he verbalized he is too embarrassed to do that and states he will wait for his daughter to call him.  I offered to call his daughter for him and he declined.   Addendum: Created by RN. 04/16/2021 02:01 PM 04/16/2021 Client called reporting the same symptoms as in 4/13 message -- I told him to go to the ER immediately. He stated he could not drive due to muscle spasms and feet and leg pain. Asked if he would please call 911 and stated that was not necessary. He verbalized he understood my directions and stated he would go to urgent Care. Called Sheriff office to make a well person check.

When rolling over in bed from flat on my back to my left side my body felt like it kept  moving when I had in fact stopped. It feels like I am rolling out of a hammock. Right side has the same sensation. Also happens if I bend over when standing. It is not always accompanied with dizziness. Severity increased over a few days, then gradually decreased over the next 5 days or so and is now increasing again. I HAVE NEVER HAD THESE SYMPTOMS IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. My pre existing tinnitus has grown very much louder. I have had occasional low pain / pressure deep in my sinuses.

I was checked by an ENT doctor, had a hearing test, they did not found anything wrong and all my tubes were clear and all points out that it is related to the J&amp;J vaccine.  My hearing varies from day to day, other times of the day it gets louder.  On Thursday 04-29-2021, it will be 6 weeks since I last got vaccinated.

At the end of my day it would clear up, my runny nose was back again. On the next morning I also experienced sore throat and a runny nose. This lasted about one week.  I went to my PCP, and they did a COVID test and I tested positive.  I can not taste anything, my nose is not runny and I have to blow up a few times a day. I have no fever 96.7F. I also get a minor phlegm when coughing.  At this time I can say my symptoms are a bit better when taking OTC Tylenol medication though I still can not taste anything.   I am taking fluids and taking Tylenol for my Covid symptoms.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included blood pressure.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805020, expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 08-APR-2021 between 09.30 and 09.40 to left arm for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) for blood pressure. On 08-APR-2021, 20 minutes after vaccination, the patient started having symptoms. The patient&#39;s heart started aching and that lasted for 15-20 minutes and then went away. On 09-APR-2021, the patient had chills that had lasted for four hours. On 10-APR-2021, the patient could not move his neck left or right and back of his head felt like it was swelling and  tender; he also had a headache, and he was extremely sleepy. The patient&#39;s neck and head tenderness lasted three to four days. On 11-APR-2021, the patient eyes had blood shot and were red and reported that he might had a stroke or blood clot. On 17-APR-2021, he had a knot came up in the center of right arch on foot. On 19-APR-2021, at the time of this report, the patient&#39;s eyes were still red and had a slight headache; the patient&#39;s neck still hurts, he was sleepy, and the knot was still there on his right arch of his foot. The patient took acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) but he was already taking that for his blood pressure. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from heart ache on 08-APR-2021, head swelling and tender on 14-APR-2021, and chills on 09-APR-2021, and had not recovered from neck hurts/could not move neck, bloodshot in eye/eyes were red, headache, sleepy, and knot in center of right arch of foot. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 64-year-old African American (non-Hispanic/Latino) hypertensive male patient reported &#34;heart aching&#34; 20 minutes after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The event lasted for 15-20 minutes.  Other associated symptoms developed in the succeeding 3 days: chills that lasted for hours, could not move his neck and felt it was swelling and tender, headache, sleepiness, blood shot eyes.  Nine days after vaccination, the patient reported he had a knot in the center of arch right foot.  The patient took Aspirin.  No other details was reported.  The event is confounded by the underlying hypertension.  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

I had no soreness or pain to my left arm after myvaccine.  Today I still have some clear, thick discharge that is present.

Had a 101.5 degree temperature all night which went down to 100 in the morning and back up to 101.2 later on the 14th.  I had nausea and extreme pain all over my body and restlessness.  it got a little better the next day but still feels like I have the flu. I had covid back in march of 2020 and was tested for the antibodies at the end of August.  There is a horrific dearth of research on people who have had covid and whether they should get the vaccines. It is disgraceful, and the next time I will listen to my gut which told me NOT to get vaccinated!
