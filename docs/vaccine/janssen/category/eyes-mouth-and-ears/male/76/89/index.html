(Did not use the med at this time), although I followed my usual routine of un educated &#34;tears&#34; in the eyes at bedtime and 2x in morning. Awaking next morning found  eye surrounds (lids, ...) were quite puffy, perhaps 1/4 &#34;swollen shut&#34;, eyes still stinging though still not terribly so.  Also noted  morning breath measurements (Peak flow, FEV1, on a hand-held device) were 5-10% lower than normal.   No &#34;sore arm&#34; or other musculature symptoms. At  ~ 50 hours post-vaccine,  am &#34;better&#34;, will now go  use some Patanol.
