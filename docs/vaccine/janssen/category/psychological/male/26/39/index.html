                                                Went most of the day with no symptoms. Performed a High Intensity Workout around 7pm for an hour, and ate shortly after. Took a hot shower and relaxed before bed time around 10pm started to have a headache. By 10:45 when I went to sleep it was an intense headache. Under the covers my body was incredibly hot, without covers I was freezing cold. I woke up around midnight in a sweat and again around 2:30am when I called in sick to work. I then sat in my bathroom for 30 minutes, threw up once, and then feeling much better (Still had an intense headache) I drank some water and fell back asleep in my room. Today is the second day, I have a small headache, have not eaten all day, and slept most of the afternoon. I highly recommend not working out the same day of getting the vaccine, I didn&#39;t think to ask about that when I received it. I doubt I would have had this problem if I rested instead.

After awaking he doesn&#39;t remember the last 5 minutes. He laid down to go to sleep and was consistently hot and then cold. He does have a history of night terrors but they have remained dormant for about 2.5 years. Around 12 am he started having one of the worst night terrors I&#39;ve seen. The following morning, April 2nd 2021, he was feeling incredibly sore and the injection spot was tender. He said &#34;it feels like I got hit by a truck.&#34; Seems to be doing okay otherwise now.

                                                Only minor chills before bed, 11pm. Muscle aches, felt as tightness in IT bands, made remaining asleep difficult. Got up to use the bathroom around 5am. Upon finishing peeing while standing, I lost consciousness, falling. As a result of the fall, I fractured my cheek bone, cut open my ear, later requiring three stitches, and was concussed, resulting in a loss of memory. I was nonresponsive when my fiance found me immediately following the crash, and was rushed to the hospital  via ambulance. Upon arrival to the hospital, my fever was found to be 102 F. As a result of the fall, I have a cheek bone fracture, three stiches in my ear, and a concussion.

I went back and checked on him after 5mins of waiting, then came back to the pharmacy. But heard a big bang shortly after. Some how, he had fallen out of his chair and bumped his head and neck on an end camp. He seemed a little confused, when I ran over, but was awake, a little sweaty and nauseated. EMS was called. They transported him to ER to have his head checked, since he bumped it.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I received the Janssen vaccine in my upper-left arm at 3:00 PM on April 5, 2021, at a public health clinic (I think that&#39;s the proper term for the site) established in a mall. After about ten minutes, during the scheduled waiting period, I began to feel lightheaded; I can best compare the feeling to that of being tipsy after a glass or two of wine. I waited another twenty minutes at the site to see if the feeling worsened, and when it didn&#39;t, I left without telling anyone how I felt. During the drive home, however, I continued to feel lightheaded during the drive home and worried that it might be affecting my driving. After I got home without incident, the feeling persisted for a few hours and ceased that evening.  Since then, I have experienced nothing but what I think are standard post-vaccination symptoms (fatigue, muscle aches, slight brain fog, swollen lymph nodes?not unlike the sensations of recovering from a modest cold). I nevertheless want to report the lightheadedness because it appears (based on news reports) that it is an unusual reaction to the vaccine. I want to make sure that my experience is recorded, even though I do not believe that I require further medical attention.

Symptoms arose approximately 8 hours after vaccination (between midnight and 1 AM, 4/9/21) and persisted until approximately 5 AM, coinciding with sleeplessness. Throughout the entirety of the next day nausea, headache, and weakness persisted. After 36 hours, mostly bedridden, and 12 hours of sleep the following night symptoms have dissipated as of 10 AM 4/10/21.

                                                The patient was nervous prior to vaccine and had a needle phobia. About 5 minutes post-vaccine, the patient stated he was not feeling well and feeling warm and sweaty. The pharmacy staff provided the patient with water and an ice pack. The patient stated he was feeling faint. The patient fainted for about 20 seconds and then became conscious again. The patient didn&#39;t have any injuries and didn&#39;t fall down. The patient was okay and he laid down and elevated his feet on a chair. He then stated that he has severe needle phobia and has fainted several times in the past with vaccine administration and blood draws. He had experienced this in the past. He was still slightly faint and requested that he be checked out. The EMT arrived and they took his vitals and checked him. By the time the EMT arrived, he was beginning to feel better and had sat up and drinking water. There were no further issues. The EMT stated he was good to head home. We followed up with patient and the patient was feeling good with no further issues.

I have had a strange and non-stop headache ever since that day, and my entire body feels like I had went to the gym and did hardcore aerobics. Those are the main two symptoms I still have as of now. I am afraid my body is being set up for a blood clot.

                                                I received the J&amp;J vaccine at 10:00am on March 18, 2021 at the Community Center. By about 5:00pm, I started to feel minor flu-like symptoms, but as the night progressed it got significantly worse. Around 8-9pm, I was bedridden with the worst chills/shaking I&#39;ve ever experienced in my life. Around 9:30-10:00pm, I was filling water at my sink and projectile vomitted multiple times into the sink and could not make it to the bathroom. Subsequently, I ate a bagel and drank lots of water, knowing my vomitting could make me dehydrated. Throughout the night, I was awake and shaking, and drank and filled my water bottle repeatedly. At 8:00am, I was filling my water, and without my knowledge of awareness, fainted on my kitchen floor, dropping the Brita filter and likely hitting my head. My roommate heard the commotion and saw me passed out in our kitchen. He tried to wake me up and I phased in, but then subsequently phased out again 20-30 seconds later as I was trying to stand and likely hit my head again. My roommate eventually got me over to our couch and called EMTs. Upon their arrival, EMTs checked my pulse, which was fine, and saw an open laceration on the back of my head, so they took me to Hospital to access the Trauma Center. On the way, I threw up repeatedly and was very lightheaded. Upon my arrival at Hospital, I was checked for any neck bone breaks, given an IV, a CT  scan, an EKG, and staples were placed in the back of my head to heal the laceration. After my release, I was bedridden for 2-3 days and required a daily nap during work (1-2) hours for the next 1 1/2 to 2 weeks. For a while, everything was fine, but recently during the first two weeks of April, it has become apparent that my head is foggy and reacts to changes in the weather, which leads me to believe that I likely banged my head pretty good when I fainted those two times.

He drank some Gatorade and ate a couple of chocolate kisses.  He began to have cold sweats that lasted a few minutes.  I sat with him in counseling room for 15 minutes and then he sat in waiting room  until he felt better.  He did not feel that he needed further attention or medical assistance.

                                                Woke up at 12:00am today with headache, lots of discomfort (especially in stomach), and for the most part could only fall back asleep for short intervals while being awake most of the night.   At around 2:30am, could barely walk into the front room. Just very slowly and painfully. Ended up in such a state that I absentmindedly urinated onnthe bathroom floor while pulling pant leg up to scratch an itch while urinating in toilet. Laying on back caused butt and thighs to hurt significantly more. Same for stomach. Getting up from and laying down on my floor mattress was and still is difficult.   Later into the morning at around 6:40am, had to crawl slowly on hands and knees to get back in the front room. By around 8am, I could walk around without it being unbearable. Just slow-ish. Ate breakfast, so stomach is more uncomfortable than in pain. Can lay on it without too much problem, but butt is still hurting. Stretching legs forward caused some pain.  Possible fever.

This progressively worsened throughout the night, resulting in my struggling to sleep, until about 4:00 am, when I noticed that I did not feel the feverish coldness symptoms as intensely.

                                                6-7 hours after receiving, I got a headache, and became very tired &amp; achey all over. I took ibuprofen &amp; acetaminophen and felt reasonably better for a few hours. Then later that night (12-18 hours after vaccine) I became much sicker and was unable to sleep. I had a low fever, upset stomach, severe chills (couldn&#39;t stop shaking/shivering for over an hour) body aches, and an extremely bad headache. I continued to use ibuprofen and acetaminophen but even combined they weren&#39;t nearly enough to relieve my symptoms. Late into the night around 3-4am (15-16 hours after vaccine) nausea became the worst side effect, surpassing the headache. I eventually vomited around 4am, after which point the symptoms became more bearable and I managed to sleep a couple hours. Thursday/Friday (two days after vaccine) I still felt very weak, achey, and tired and had to call out of work both days. I was never again in the severe discomfort I experienced Wednesday night/Thursday morning, but I still felt a little tired, achey, and mildly sour stomach on days 3 &amp;4 (Saturday/Sunday). Monday morning I felt similarly tired &amp; achey, but I do feel essentially back to normal Monday night.

                                                Around 6 pm the same day I received the J&amp;J shot I started to feel chilly and a little nausea. I went for a walk for about 40 mins started to feel worse. I had body aches throughout my back and chest and in both arms, was freezing. Tried to eat dinner but couldn?t, too much pain and increased nausea. Tried to lay down, but began having a fast heartbeat and fast/some difficulty breathing. The pain in my chest was the worst pain I?ve ever felt. Continued feeling horrible with a fever of 100.7, nausea, headache pains throughout chest back and arms, freezing, and my arms and legs felt like they were becoming numb. Could not stand, very dizzy, tried to sleep through it. I threw up around 11 and did so a couple more times after that. Was finally able to sleep and woke up feeling much better. Arm is still sore at the injection point.

Lasted through the night and hindered sleep without the help of OTC sleep medication.  After 8 hours of overnight sleep, woke up next day feeling better, but still had a terrible headache and a great deal of fatigue.  Considered visiting a walk-in clinic or the ER at least four times throughout this timeframe.  Symptoms lessened with time with a bad headache and lingering fatigue being the most consistent 24 to 36 hours after the initial injection time.  Now May 3 at 1:00pm, several days after, most symptoms have subsided except for some lingering fatigue which still is present.

On April 16th I still had the headaches and leg pain , but also while driving I began loosing my vision and started to pass out/faint. I Pulled over and waited at least a half hour. during that time I. noticed I couldn&#39;t type or read anything on my phone as I was trying to reach a friend to help me. eventually after time had passed I was able to drive myself to a friends where I thought the best thing would be to sleep it off. the headaches and leg pain lasted a couple more days and I thought it was going to go away, but it is now May 5th and today and last couple days the leg pain feels more like someone has been punching my left leg. five had chest pain and headaches return. I do not have medical insurance and have avoided going to the hospital or primary care because I am afraid. today the pain is so irritating and sore I wish I could escape my body.

                                                Muscle aches in armpits began a few hours after receiving the dose.  Within 8 hours of dose, a mild fever and chills began (around 100 degrees F). I attempted to take a bath to soothe aches but it did not help, and instead tried to go to sleep at 8:30 pm. A slight red rash appeared on chest and arms around this time.  I was woken up at 10:30 pm feeling disoriented and hot, with a fever of 104.5 degrees F. My wife noticed slurring of words and that I seemed unstable and confused, and symptoms were severe enough we considered going to the emergency room.  I experienced ringing in my ears and a severe headache.  I took 2 extra strength Tylenol, put a cold cloth on forehead, and drank fluids to fall back asleep.  Fever dropped to around 102 but continued throughout the night.  I woke up at 6:30 am and took two more Tylenol.  The severe headache continued and I vomited twice.  I attempted to take a shower and rinse off, and continue to rest.  Fever is reduced to 99 degrees F with help of Tylenol.

I drank a ton of fluids, used OTC treatments (Ibuprofen and Motrin) but nothing alleviated the pain. By 10 am I had a sustained fever over 100 degrees. I was in so much pain I was crying in bed. By 3 pm my fever reached 102 degrees. I had to go to the emergency room for IV drip and medication because I couldn&#39;t drink enough water to stay hydrated. Once given IV, my temperature plummeted. When the medication they administered wore off, my body started experiencing mild to moderate pains again. Body aches and soreness all over- my muscles feel like they are being squeezed from the inside. I am still feeling a lot of fatigue and pain but it is random and comes and goes along with &#34;hot flashes&#34;.

The next morning I woke up with a headache and was achy/sore throughout my body. While I was eating I passed out without any signs. I was unconscious and do not remember the episode. Once I was alert, I felt nauseas and was heading to the restroom when I passed out again and was unconscious. I do not remember the episodes. There were no signs of passing out before I did either time.

                                                Employee came at 1:30 to get vaccinated.  Three to five  minutes after administering the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, I asked the patient if he is feeling ok because he seemed nervous and sweaty. He responnded &#34;yes, but I have a mental anxiety from vaccines, needls, doctors&#34;. one minute later he started complaining of pain in his left arm and feeling weak. . He then asked to sit on the floor and said that he can hardly breath, and lost vision. I administered Epipen injection to his left thigh while the store director was calling 911. He then complained about not being able to move his hand fingers. The ambulance came and took him to the ER. later in the day, his manager said that he spoke to hid family and they told him that he has been having anxiety from doctors, needls, and shots ever since he was little. He is feeling better now and the hospital will keep him for tomorrow.

                                                Patient received Janssen Covid-19 vaccination today at approximately 6:20pm.  At 6:35, he said he had left arm weakness (arm he received vaccine in), fatigue, was dizzy, and felt &#34;off&#34;.  Patient did not lose consciousness and refused an ice pack.  BP checked at 6:38pm (170/98, pulse 105).  Patient stated his blood pressure usually runs high. I offered him an ice pack a second time, but he said there was no need and he felt better.  BP checked again 6:52pm (152/101, pulse 99).  I recommended that since his blood pressure is usually this high, he should follow up with his primary doctor regarding blood pressure as he may need some medication to assist in lowering it.  He said ok.  He left the pharmacy area at 7:02pm and said he was fine to leave, he did not want to remain any longer.

Did not have an allergic reaction. Did not need to call 9-1-1. Just worked himself up so much about it. Sent him home as I didn&#39;t want him to complete his shift while vomiting. Was having chills and wasn&#39;t sure how long they were going to last. Left him to go home with girlfriend. Went out front to wait for his ride and get some fresh air. Exchanged numbers so I could keep in contact with him. Knows to contact EMS if symptoms worsen.

Tylenol helped but when it wore off I recorded a high 103-low 104 degree fever. Tylenol and a bath helped bring it down, rest of day just headache  and weakness, sweating. By 4pm next day started feeling a bit more normal. The night/morning of was the worst fever/sickness I can remember feeling.

Slept until 11:15pm and woke up to violent shivering, pounding headache, full body aches, sore skin, achey joints, nausea, swelling tongue and throat. Took 1 dose of nyquil and then tossed and turned all night, very little sleep, symptoms persisted into the next day, but shivering stopped in the night. By morning (3-14) registered a fever of 100.3 which persisted most of the day along with remaining lessening symptoms. By evening I was still very sore, bad headache, and very lethargic/fatigued. Next morning (3-15) low temp of 97.1 degrees, headache, fatigue, lightheaded. Still feel headachy and tired.

I took tylonel during this time. I also experienced diarrhea and loss of appetite during the day; random periods of feeling nauseous. I seemed to be dehydrated but drank a normal amount of water the day before. It felt like I had the flu, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve felt this sick since I was a kid. It was terrible. I felt incredibly tired on Tuesday but couldn&#39;t fall asleep. 3/17--woke up today feeling mostly fine minus a bit of lingering soreness and feeling very tired still.

I asked him if he had trouble breathing and he stated he had not. He appeared like he was about to pass out, I was asking him questions about his state and he wasn&#39;t being coherent. I told him I was going to give an EpiPen and call 911. I gave him the EpiPen in his outer thigh. EMS came 5 minutes later.  A few hours later I got a call from a close by asking if I had given him a Benadryl because he was feeling drowsy. I asked his status and the nurse stated he was doing fine.

                                                High fever reaching 103.8° F. Between 7pm and 12am, my fever ranged from 100-103.8° F Elevated resting heart rate of 90-130 beats per minute. My normal is 62-75 bpm. While I was sleeping, my heart rate ranged from 93-113 bpm (according to Apple Watch). Extreme headache Inability to sleep Chills and shakes Extreme fatigue Light headed and unable to speak clearly  I don?t know if this was life threatening; I know it was likely my immune system responding but these side effects were extreme. I almost called an ambulance. I?ve never felt pain like that before in my head. My heart felt like it was racing all night and my brain felt like it was going to expand out of my skull. The head pain, heart rate, and rapid breathing was keeping me up.  I tried to sleep 7pm?12am which was the worst of it. By the middle of the night, it seemed that the fever subsided and my resting heart rate was more in the 90-100 range (still 15-30% high).   The next day, I have a moderate headache that feels like after pain from the night before. Fever subsided. Heart rate is slightly high at 80-100 bpm. I managed to sleep in the whole morning.  I had to take off from work today in order to rest.

To this day (one month later) by ability to recall memories and recall words remains poor. I have troubles forming sentences because words don&#39;t come to me. To this day I cannot recall anything that happened days 1-3 after the vaccine. I was able to write this report because my partner made me take notes on how I felt. Prior to the vaccine I never had an issue with memory recall. My physical reactions cleared during the second week after the vaccine. However, the mental reactions still stubbornly persist.

I move to my bed. 7:30 PM - In bed, dressed in sweatshirt, wool socks, etc., a a couple blankets wrapped around me, space heater turned to 80 degrees, shaking uncontrollably from being so cold (mostly hands and feet), mild headache begins in middle back of head.  8:00 PM - still freezing, temperature was at 98.7. most of body is aching 9:00 PM - chills and body ache starting to slow down, temperature at 100.3 9:30 PM - still have chills, space heater still on and i was still wrapped in a bunch of clothing/blankets. temp at 100.5 and i drank 6 oz water.  10 PM - chills going away, heat/blankets/clothing still on, temp at 101. body aches mostly only in left and right calf.   Rest of night until around 4 A.M. was me tossing and turning being restless. My heart rate was ~130 BPM throughout the entire night according to my smart watch. I was checking my temperature constantly with an infrared thermometer and it was between 101-102.5. I probably drank ~24 oz of water throughout the night. It felt like each time i fell asleep, i would wake up no more than 30 min later and each time i woke up it felt like i had been asleep for 5 hours. At a few moments it felt like i was hallucinating seeing little boxes around my head.. At no point  during the episode did i take any advil/tyenol/etc. Only drank water. Woke up around noon the next day, I felt extremely groggy, still had a headache and my temperature was back to ~98.  I ate for the first time that day around 1 P.M. and had a few advil which helped with my headache.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Had typical reaction for 2 nights after shot (Severe headache, chills, fever, muscle cramps, etc), but chills, headache and nausea persisted.   Currently (6 days after vaccine) I have feeling of pressure in head above left ear. Pressure accompanied by slight headache, dizziness, feeling flush, stomach pain, and tingling in right hand.   These symptoms haven&#39;t changed over last 4 days, and most pronounced is head pressure, dizziness, and general disorientation.   Haven&#39;t taken medication, just getting good rest and hydration, but symptoms aren&#39;t lessening.

                                                Patient received vaccine at around 11am.  After waiting around for a few minutes he stated he was light headed.  I went over to observe and gave patient some water.  He was starting to sweat and turned very pale.  1 minute later he passed out.  I brought him to the floor from his chair and he  starting shaking and &#39;seizing&#34; for about 10-15 seconds.  We used pressure on his chest to try to &#34;snap&#34; him out of it.  After about 15 seconds of &#34;seizing,not breathing normally and his left arm completely locked up&#34; he came to and did not know where he was for about 2-3 minutes.  After about that time he started to realize where he was and recognized his wife who was assisting.  EMS was called and arrived shortly,  He was lucid and knew where he was and started to feel normal again.  EMS checked his vitals and they were normal.  Patient refused to go to hospital and EMS released him to his wife.  I checked on patient 4 hours later and he had no ill effects and stated he felt just like he did before receiving the vaccination.

By the time 11pm came around I was in a full blown fever which lasted until around 5:30 am the next day. The fever was reduced through the taking of two Acetaminophen pills. Throughout the night, I was unable to sleep due to intense headache pain, I felt exhausted and couldn?t move. I had a fever around 102 degrees Fahrenheit at its peak and maintaining usually around 101.4 degrees. I was nauseous and experienced emotional instability. The adverse affects lasted until the morning with some affects such as the headaches and nausea still currently lingering on to present time (10:48am).

                                                Joints began feeling achy and body felt tired within a few hours of vaccination. About 10 hours later body began to feel warm and then within an hour began uncontrollable shivers and aching in testicles followed shortly after by a throbbing headache and pain behind eyeballs. I put on extra clothing and jumped into bed as symptoms persisted. Later in the night I began sweating profusely and removed the clothing. The headache and pain behind the eyes persisted. I also began feeling nauseous and almost vomited when I went to the bathroom. My body was so tired and achy I could barely move. I tried to wake up for work but my headache and pain behind the eyes was so bad I went back to bed for another four hours. I did not have any appetite for the rest of the day.  My headache subsided that afternoon and I went for a walk that night and my body still felt incredibly tired and achy. The pain behind my eyes persisted. The following day I felt somewhat better and could work. That night I went for a jog and my body felt extremely heavy, my joints ached, and I could not catch my breath. My symptoms continued to improve but I have had no sex drive for a week.

My eyes felt like they were being pushed out of their sockets. My body hurt. It hurt to move. My neck , knees, ankles and back were in shooting dull pain. It took everything I had to stand up. I couldn&#39;t get to sleep. I had a fever. I started to shiver. My thought raced. It began to hurt to breath. My lower chest is sore on the inside where the lungs meets the rib cage.   I could not to go class or do any work. Was easily one of the worst nights of my life.

He recovered in less than a minute and felt good after it. We took care of him. We observed him for more than 30 minutes. He felt really well after that minute. It was not a adverse reaction to the medication. He said he felt anxious with flu shot as well

                                                I developed extreme body aches and chills along with an extreme fever, and it progressed throughout the night until I was delirious. I fainted once trying to take medication (ibeprofen) in the bathroom. I never measured the fever because I was delirious and could hardly move due to pain. I have never felt so sick in my life and I am a healthy 30 year old with no other health issues. I am feeling better this morning but have lingering symptoms of chills and aches. I am reporting this because the intensity of the reaction seemed overwhelmingly extreme and scary for someone of my health and age.

                                                Immediately after injection: pain and soreness around injection site.  Starting about 3-4 hours later: impaired coordination.  The next morning: severe dehydration, disorientation, loss of balance, very low energy, headache, body aches, inability to remain standing or sitting, difficulty walking, fever, feeling hot and cold, sweating and shivering intermittently and sometimes both at the same time, impaired mental focus, worsened pain and soreness around the injection site, nightmares. Slept the majority of the day, rising only to eat and drink lots of water.  Symptoms abated throughout the day. By about 7pm, I was able to sit up enough to play some video games.  The second morning: most symptoms gone or almost unnoticeable.  Hot/cold flashes, impaired coordination and low energy continue, but improving. Attempted to go out for my usual 2-mile jog after work, but only made it about one block walking before becoming both too cold and too tired to continue.  The third day, afternoon: completed my usual 2-mile route, at a walk, with frequent stops to rest.  No noticeable symptoms from the 4th day after injection, onwards.

Over the course of the day, the fever and all other symptoms gradually subsided. By the morning of the next day (4/10/2021) I was completely back to normal and feeling healthy again.

When the exhaustion would hit, starting the day after injection, I was too weak to go up and down stairs. It seemed significant and was more than normal tiredness, and I ended up needing to take a half day at work four days after vaccination. On the sixth day after vaccination, I was feeling well again and discomfort at the injection site had subsided as well.  It was the worst the day after getting vaccinated, which was to be expected. I did not expect it to last so long.

                                                Injection was around noon, felt fine until dinnertime At around 5pm I started feeling a little groggy, lack of appetite By 7 pm I was experiencing moderate chills and shakes and tingling fingers and tongue, shakes subsided around 830p 9pm I went to sleep, 11pm woke up disoriented having been tossing and turning, elevated heart rate (approx 120 bpm) and temp (101.5) which lasted until around 12:30 am  Resolved with symptoms of pressure headache until mid morning, made it difficult to sleep  Treatment was ice and water, cold compress, hot shower, then in the morning two tylenol  Day2 only effects seem to be those lingering from the night before (tired from lack of sleep, muscle soreness from shakes)  The main fear was the high heart rate which was only listed in my side effects packet as something to look out for shortly after the injection as sign of an allergy, not something that would come on later

By the end of the following day (March 20, 2021) my side effects were essentially gone. I felt normal until Wednesday (March 24, 2021) afternoon where the same symptoms returned but were more pronounced (i.e. worse headache). I am writing this Saturday March 27, 2021 and am still having headaches, sensitive skin, and a mild fever.

                                                a 31 year old man who received the  COVID-19 vaccine on March 27, 2021 in the  Public Health Department parking lot. Upon arrival and check in, the patient declined any comorbidities and health history but did state that he was nervous. After administration of the vaccine by  NP, the patient lowered himself to the ground, from a sitting position, and had a 60 second tonic clonic seizure. Seizure precautions such as turning the patient on his side, supporting his head, and calling EMS were taken during the seizure. After 60 seconds, the patient came to and asked what happened. PPHD staff oriented the patient to what had happened, to which he proceeded to say ?oh that is normal for me when I get anxious.? With the help of PPHD staff and his wife, the patient was brought to a sitting position and given a granola bar and water to his request. According to clinic lead RN, ?his skin was normal in appearance for race, ethnicity, and age. He was mildly diaphoretic. He verbalized feelings of anxiety and worry surrounding the vaccine.?   As EMS arrived on the scene and began assessing vital signs the patients anxiety appeared to increase; he became less verbal, closed his eyes, and his breathing pattern became shallow. The patient then had a second seizure at this time lasting approximately 25 seconds. When the patient came to he immediately verbalized, ?I?m good, I?m good, I?m fine?. He was slow to respond to verbal cues, but persistently refused transport to the local acute care hospital for further evaluation. He rested on the ground in supine position for approximately 25 minutes, with his partner and EMS at his side. Upon further evaluation of the patient and his wife, it was determined that the patient has a history of seizure activities when he is nervous and that he was ?expecting? this to happen. The patient continued to decline medical care and transportation to the hospital. The patient left in medically stable condition with his wife operating the vehicle.

He was awake again in about a minute.  The patient was sweating, pale and a little disoriented for a couple minutes but started improving steadily until he was feeling his normal self again.  The EMS was called but the patient declined being taken to the hospital as he felt much better by the time they arrived.

Patient said he had fever within 24 hours of the vaccine and was feeling miserable (severe fatigue, chills, fever, nausea, headaches).  He said he was feeling slightly better than the first 24 hours but still feeling really bad. He has been taking Advil which has help slightly.  I advised him to monitor symptoms and to call dr if symptoms get worst and to keep us posted.    I called patient today to follow up with patient and he said that he was not feeling that much better.  He did have a virtual visit with his doctor and was prescribed azithromycin, prednisone, and an inhaler.  Patient has been on medication for a couple of days.  He will continue meds and call us if things do not improve

Felt as though nausea was impending. Sensation rose into skull in &#34;crawling waves&#34;. Skull felt heavy. Interpreted the sensation as disorientation. Asked pharmacist if dizziness was normal with the vaccine. Woke up a few seconds later picking myself up off the floor.

                                                At 23:15 (7 hours after the dose) I started to get cold while under my blankets trying to sleep. My teeth began chattering as I started to shiver. I got up out of bed to put on a sweater. With each step I took towards the sweater my body started to fully shiver and contract. After about 4 or 5 steps I could no longer move and I fell over. I started having full body spasms and full contractions. I felt like I pulled every muscle in my body trying to relax and fight the contractions. It felt like I was being tasered for about 10-15 minutes. Once I had the strength to grab my sweater I slipped it on. As my body warmed up these contraction subsided.  By 01:00 (9 hours after dose) my body temperature had spiked. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer to check my temperature but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I spiked a fever. I placed a wet cloth on the back of my neck, forehead and chest to cool down.   At 06:00 (14 hours after dose) I took a cold shower to further drop my body&#39;s temperature. It felt like a full body sun burn where you just radiate heat. I was hot everywhere.  At 08:00 (16 hours after dose) I took three (3) 500mg ibuprofen to help fight a nagging headache. I did not have much appetite for food. I regularly eat breakfast in the morning (bowl of cereal).   From 09:00 to 12:00 (17-20 hours after dose) I felt groggy. Did not seem or act like myself. Was very tired from the lack of sleep the night prior. Seemed very fatigued.  Around 13:00 (21 hours after dose) I took a 45-60 minute nap. Woke up feeling much better. I would say most / if not all symptoms subsided after 22-24 hours.

Patient moved from the chair to the floor because he felt like he was going to pass out.  Patient passed out for about 30 seconds, slight twitching during episode and then came through.  He was a bit disoriented but alert, we had him stick around until his wife came and picked him up.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the injection, I became dizzy and lightheaded. My  eyesight became blurry and my hearing very &#34;tinny&#34;. I felt nausea and  thought I was going to throw up. I sat down in a chair and was given a granola bar and some water. After about 3 or 4 minutes the majority of these  seemed to fade, but I still felt slightly &#34;off&#34;. Approximately 9pm that evening I felt very fatigued, so I went to bed. At approximately midnight, I woke up shivering, extremely cold, and sweating. Around 2am I had a fever of 102.3. I took some Tylenol to try to bring my fever down, which seemed to help. Around 9am the next morning my fever was gone, though I still felt extremely fatigued.  Later that evening, after several naps, I started to feel a little better. Most of these adverse events were resolved by 28 hours after injection. I had arm soreness at the injection sight that felt like having been punched in the arm for about a week after the injection.

Then got the chills pretty bad as I laid down to go to bed. Became really sore all over.  Couldn?t stay asleep for more than an hour. Later in the night I started sweating and felt really hot. Also became quite thirsty. During the entire night I also had horrible dreams. After about 5am things started improving. Had some light sensitivity in the morning for a shot bit. By noon I was almost back to 100%

                                                April 9 Morning: woke up with a mild headache. April 9 Afternoon (12 pm): feeling fatigued and headache grew worse. Plus chills. April 9 (5pm): feeling very cold and tired (worse than noon) April 9 (11:30pm): This time was the most severe for me in respect to side effects. I believe my headache woke me up. The headache was so bad that my eyes hurt as well (swollen almost). I think my fever broke. I felt very ?heavy? all over. The main concern was that around midnight I was having sharp pains on the right side of my body, near where my Liver is located. That was one effect that I did not read about. The sharp pains happened once every few minutes. I considered going to the ER but wasn?t sure. I ended up just changing my shirt, got some water, and went back to bed.  April 10: My appetite was not normal, I ate but very little. The sharp pain on my right side went away but I had a minor headache for the rest of the day.

I had to get up and did not sleep again that night. I also experienced a slight difficulty in taking deep breaths. All of my muscles were sore and continue to be so 36 hours later, though that is improving. I did get normal sleep the following night.

                                                I typically faint when getting shots or blood drawn. I did faint about 10 seconds after the initial shot injection. I was conscious throughout but was not able to speak clearly or control my body even though I could hear everything going on around me. After 30 minutes, I was feeling back to normal. The remainder of the day I felt drowsy and a little out of it. At 12:15am I began to get severe chills and shakes. This lasted throughout the night but was the worst from about 12:15-1:00am. I woke up at 4am with a fever and sweating. My entire body was stiff and in pain with aches specifically in my arms and legs. Very sore pain in my left deltoid where the shot was injected and is still slightly sensitive. It felt like my veins were stiff and in pain and it hurt to move. I had what I can describe as flu like symptoms (i.e. my teeth hurt, my body ached, fever, shakes, body stiffness and overall tiredness and weakness). These all lasted until about 6:30am at the worst and were relieved over the next few hours. I started to feel back to normal around 3pm later that day. That was April 11th. Last night, April 12th, I had trouble sleeping because my left arm was in pain from my elbow to fingers. It was a lingering pain that went away by this morning and  is mostly gone now (morning April 13th).

I started feeling flu like fatigue, body aches, and a headache 8 hours post injection. I ran a 101&#43; fever Monday night and got less than 4 hours sleep due to fever and fairly intense muscle aches. On Tuesday morning the headache, fever and muscle aches persisted till the late evening accompanied by general fatigue. By 9:00 on Tuesday night I was feeling significant improvement and slept well Tuesday night with minor night sweats on and off. Wednesday morning I felt 80% back to normal. No fever, minor headache only evident when standing up quickly or sudden head movement, and continued muscles aches body wide specifically in the neck and chest as well as injection site muscle soreness. These symptoms continue to persist into Thursday at the same or perhaps slightly elevated levels. Friday 4/15 symptoms persist with generalized soreness, fatigue, headache,  injection site soreness. Not his typical self.

                                                I experienced a sudden onset of symptoms approximately 7 hours post-vaccination. Symptoms started with severe chills, elevated heart rate, fever (~102), and progressed into muscle and joint soreness, severe migraine with sensitivity to light, and strong fatigue, coupled with insomnia. The symptoms were severe enough that I considered going to the hospital, but ultimately did not. Fever, chills, and elevated heart rate subsided by the next morning (~12 hours after onset), but muscle soreness, migraine, and fatigue lasted for another 12-24 hours, along with a loss of appetite.  I am an otherwise healthy, male adult with no outstanding medical conditions whatsoever. This was one of the most severe immune responses I have ever had, including actual illnesses. I have received other vaccinations in the past and never had any response nearly as severe. I was significantly concerned for my overall health during the height of the vaccine response, and I wanted to report this to ensure that is aware of these types of responses, and can help prepare others by informing them adequately of the types of responses to expect from the vaccine. This response very much took me by surprise in terms of severity -- I had to call out of work at a critical time.

                                                After receiving vaccine patient was about to sit in observation chair, he started seizing and fainting. Hit his nose and had nose bleed. He was having panic attack due to injection. Called 911. We made him comfortable and then in 5 minutes he started to faint. Ex-Ems was next to him, he started asking him questions and make sure he was awake. Within 5 minutes EMS arrived and they took over, checked all his vitals and found out patient did not eat or drink for whole day and had phobia with needles. Patient refused to go to hospital. Per EMS recommendation patient had drink and a bagel. Patient&#39;s relative came and took him home.

Immunizing technician immediately called the RPh over to assess the patient. RPh instructed technician to grab blood pressure (BP) cuff and bottled water. BP did not register on cuff, the patient&#39;s pulse was 54. After a brief unresponsive episode, the patient became responsive &amp; drank water. Then became sweaty and unresponsive 2 more times. RPh monitored for 30 minutes and will check in on 5/8/2021.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after injection I began experiencing extreme fatigue. This was soon followed by uncontrollable shaking and chills. As this progressed I began to experience extreme aching pains all over my body, a headache, and dizziness. I fell asleep somewhere around 11pm or 2 hours after on set of symptoms. I awoke multiple times in the night to body aches and a head splitting migraine. During the night the chills and shaking turned into a fever and sweating. At 6am the next day I forced myself to take some painkillers and hydrate. The body aches had started to recede at that point but the migraine was extremely painful and It was nearly impossible to open my eyes with a hypersensitivity to light. I slept on-and-off through the next morning and nearly all symptoms stopped by 1pm on May 8 or 24 hours after the injection.

I took an ibuprofen to help reduce the fever then slept. For the next six days I had an on again and off again low grade fever and was nauseas most of the time. Sometime during those 6 days I developed intermitted tingling in my left hand, primarily by index finger. This continues to today happening roughly once a day.  On rare occasion my right had will do the same thing but that is far less often. I never had tingling in either hand prior to my vaccine. I also developed heartburn occurring roughly 1-2 times a day. Prior to the vaccine I rarely (1-2 times a year) had heartburn and I have not changed anything about my diet or lifestyle since my vaccine. Occasionally my head feels &#34;foggy&#34; as well and this began sometime after the vaccine but I can&#39;t recall exactly when it started. It&#39;s not a headache, more of a slight lightheaded, dull feeling. I had none of these symptoms with any regularity until I was administered the vaccine.

I grabbed an epi-pen and ran outside to the car.  Patient was breathing and had a pulse rate of 64.  He aroused shortly after I began asking him if he could hear me and asked if he could tell me his name.  He was pale (notably his lips were quite pale) and confused.  He could not say his name but could nod appropriately to questions when asked.  We immediately called EMS for assistance.  They arrived within 4-5 minutes and transported the patient to hospital.

He states he recalled a nurse rubbing on his chest and placing a cold pack on his neck and at this point he began to feel better. He states he was trying to &#34;fight&#34; the feeling and was tensing up his extremities but denied convulsions or any loss

                                                I received the shot around 11AM on the 11th. By 5PM that evening I was beginning to have a headache and chills. I drove home from work and by 6PM I had severe chills, I was shaking so bad I could barely fill a cup of water and take ibuprofen, the water was sloshing out of the cup. I had a fever of 102 and spend the rest of the evening in bed, shaking. By around 10 PM the severe chills had subsided and my fever was 101.  I did not sleep much during the night due to a headache and alternating chills/sweating. This morning it is 7 AM and my temperature is 99.5 and I am beginning to feel more normal. I took advil at first and then tylenol every 4 hours during the night.

The symptoms progressed to feeling week and having a chill by 10:00 PM.  I woke several time during the night feeling hot and uncomfortable.  By the time I woke up at 6:30 AM the following morning those symptoms had gone.  I had a bad headache in the morning and took acetaminophen which helped alleviate the headache.  I have felt a bit weak and tired through the day.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  First day after getting the shot I got a feeling of being very tired throughout the day I did not feel like to do anything. Also my arm was very very sore. Even moving it slightly a bit would hurt. The second day is when things got way worse I could not really sleep that well throughout the night because I noticed I had  body aches in my legs and my back. Throughout that day I also felt like I had a fever in the morning I took my temperature and had a 100 fever. At night time I took my temperature and it went up to 102, with  still a bad headache, chills, and body aches throughout my legs mostly. I also felt some palpitations. When I went to bed I was sweating very prefusively all night that I had to change my shirt. On the third day I felt a lot better, still with a slight headache no fever, and still feeling like im sweating on and off.

                                                After administration of Janssen vaccine 0.5mL, pt reported arm was hurting and he began moving arm.  CMA noticed that continued to shake arm after 5 minutes but patient was alert and oriented x 3.  CMA thought the way he was shaking his arm seemed irregular so she advised pt he would be taken to an observation area for further observation.  Half way to the observation area, pt reported to CMA that he was seeing spots and felt like he was going to get sick.  CMA called for help.  Patient experienced a syncopal event just as he made it to the chair.  Several staff was helping to support patient.  Legs were lifted to another chair.  Patient was not responsive for a short time, very diaphoretic, breathing regular and unlabored.  Patients eyes then rolled upward toward the ceiling and patient&#39;s entire body began shaking uncontrollably while staff managed to keep patient from falling to floor from the chair.  Once patient was conscious, he was able to state his name but reported he was very confused and could not think clearly.  He was able to sit upright.  In the meantime while patient was shaking uncontrollably, staff sought urgent care provider to come and see patient.  Patient was then taken over to the urgent care side of the building to evaluate and treat patient.

                                                Right arm became very sore the following day and remained extremely sore for about five days after receiving the first and final dose of the J&amp;J vaccine.  On the day following the injection, I began developing a headache.  I didn&#39;t think twice about it until the headache didn&#39;t go away on the second day, the third, the fourth, but finally the fifth day it seemed to subside.  The intensity was severe and was concerning due to how long it lasted.  I had simply assumed that it was normal side effects.  Yesterday on Monday, 04/12/2021, I developed severe and sharp pains in my stomach/abdomen that actually put me in bed all day.

Headache resolved within 24 hrs after which I was able to rest and recover, while having a low grade fever and minor fever on day 2 (48hrs). Total recovery took 3 days. The reason for reporting is that this headache was unusually severe and prevented me from sleeping, delaying recovery.

                                                Within maybe 20-30 minutes of vaccination, I noticed a small dull pain in my right calf;  I disregarded and walked back to the car.  This pain has reduced over the last week, but is still vaguely present.  5-6 hours after vaccination, headache and strong sinus-headache.  Laid down to rest.  I woke up around 20-30 minutes later with full body tremors and muscle spasms.  Muscle spasms particularly violent in my back, feeling similar to if someone was involuntarily using one of those muscle-stimulator elecrode pad systems on  me;  could feel each individual muscle tensing and releasing at random.  Tremors and spasms persisted and then diminished over the next 4-5 hours.   99.7F fever was recorded.   Chills, fever, nightsweats, and repeated sleepless rest/waking every 30-40 minutes until the next day.  Headache was still strong and present at 4am,  took 600mg ibuprofen and continued hydrating.  Headache, general soreness, and fever persisted for ~3 days, but manageable with hydration and rest.  On day 3 a rash appeared on both my knees/innerthigh just above the knee.  Likely not hives, subdermal red speckles that appeared at night;  close to 4mm in diameter, skin was warm to the touch and very itchy.  Most of the rash was gone by morning, and the itching and warmth was completely gone.  I have noticed a very similar rash appear on my front left collar/shoulder area just this morning, but no itch/warmth.  Outcomes: Muscle spasms/tremors subsided within a day. Fever/headache subsided within 3 days Knee/Thigh rash gone. More similar rash just appeared on upper left shoulder/collar. Upper calf dull pain still present, but only barely  &#34;It feels a bit off&#34; would be the best description.

                                                First 10 minutes directly after administration: arm pain, dizziness, nausea. Felt like I was going to pass out for about 5 minutes. Felt basically normal by the time I left the facility and my arm has not been hurting since.   Approx 8:00 PM onset of headache, progressively worsening thru ~11:00 PM and plateauing. Headache was less by ~8:00 AM, and took Ibuprophin at 9:00 AM to further alleviate.   Approx 9:30-10:00 PM onset of chills and shivering, progressively worsening thru ~11:30 PM. Chills lasted through the night, but shivering stopped around 12:00 AM after turning the heat up and putting on more clothing, beanie, and blankets.   Fatigue is ongoing (as of now, ~22.5 hours after administration), but may be a result of poor sleep due to the chills overnight.

T&#43; 2 days - 7 days: fever subsides, hot flashes increase in intensity significantly, continuing to interfere with sleep. Other possible androgenic symptoms begin to arise: change in body odor, sex drive, motivations, appetite. T&#43; 7 days till current: previous symptoms of days 2-7 continue, extremely gradual onset headache begins one night. Making sure to rule out hydration and electrolyte imbalance expecting headache to be gone in the morning after sleep, I found that it was only worse and that an interpolation of the two pain points from when I went to sleep and woke up would have created a almost imperceptibly gradual but linear increase between the two points. The headache was of a type I had never had before, located in the center of my head just barely dorsal to the spinal insertion. It felt deeper than any headache I had had before which usually occur in the frontal lobe/neocortex zone. I do not regularly suffer headaches getting maybe a couple per year. Once I recognized androgenic involvement and the headache were continuing I took myself to the ER where I was evaluated and despite presenting with continuous hypertension and the symptoms mentioned above, I could not get them to perform a estrogen test and they let me leave with hypertension without any investigation. I&#39;m returning today to their urgent care facility to try again to get my estrogen levels checked. I had left a message on the phone line of VAERS prior to the original ER visit but had not heard back from anyone so I felt it was prudent to file a written report here.

                                                Patient was advised to remain in observation area for 30 minutes due to history of breathing difficulty with sulfa antibiotics in past. Shortly after being vaccinated the patient presented to our service window stating he did not feel well and was immediately escorted by the pharmacist to our administration area to have a seat. He stated he felt light headed, flushed (though not visibly), felt like his heart was racing, and was not having diffuculty breathing but felt like he couldn&#39;t catch his breath and stated he thought he was having a panic attack. He had stated before vaccination that he had not had a vaccine since his routing childhood schedule, his whole family had already had doses, and he had been putting it off because he was nervous. He insisted he needed some fresh air several times and was escorted outside by the pharmacist (with emergency supplies and a cell phone and within shouting distance of the pharmacy) for continued obsevation and was given water when requested. After a few minutes he stated he felt much better and the symptoms had resoved. He was directly observed outside per his request for the remainder of his waiting period and had no further symptoms. He was instructed to call the pharmacy right away if he had any additional symptoms after leaving.

Pharmacy staff rushed to his aid and he regained consciousness within a minute.    He said he was feeling flushed and dizzy.   He said he was having too much anxiety and has had fainting issue with vaccinations/MRI in the past.  His blood pressure was low with high heart rate.  We called 911 and paramedics came immediately.  He was still unstable so the paramedics took him for further evaluation

                                                Just before bed, about a week after getting the vaccine, I started to itch on my feet and arms. I fell asleep and woke up at about 3 AM with incredibly itchy skin from the tops of my feet all the way up to my shoulders. It was so itchy and uncomfortable that it woke me up. I took 2 Benadryl and put some anti-itch lotion on, and was able to fall asleep. I woke up the next morning feeling groggy, but better. The itch has not returned at all in the week since this happened.

                                                Terrible body aches starting at 8pm on April 1st.  Then had the chills.  Was able to take ibuprofen and slept for a bit.  Next morning April 2, got a migraine where it hurt to open my eyes.  Had that for about 2 hours then got better.  Also, I had trouble eating.  I would take a small bite of crackers and feel like I was going to throw up.  Took me a long time to eat a package of crackers and to drink 1 whole bottle of gatorade.  I took more ibuprofen through the day and that helped.  Around 5pm that night I was able to eat a little more and drink some with out feeling sick to my body.  Around 9pm that night headache came back and I went to bed for the night.  Today April 3 I feel a lot better.  Body still aches a bit and feels like I?ve been sick for 2 days so will probably take today and tomorrow to fully recoup.  No headache today.  Just small aches and tired.

Patient started to feel light headed and nauseous while walking to his car.  About 20 minutes following vaccination, a vaccinator had walked passed his vehicle and noted that he was unconscious.  Patient was still unconscious upon medical response team arrival and unresponsive to stimuli.  Once the patient awoke about 30 seconds later, he continued to state that he was nauseated and ?did not feel good.?  Patient was unaware that he had lost consciousness.

                                                At roughly 8 to 10 hours after injection I started developing a minor fever, fatigue, slight loss of appetite, lack of focus, chills and aches. Signs and symptoms continued to worsen throughout the night and next morning. Unable to sleep due to an increase in chills, fever progressed to 101.3F, developed a severe headache, aches were more prominent, same with fatigue. Loss of appetite went away. Started taking cold medication in the morning which either helped reduce the signs and symptoms or I had already experienced the apex of the adverse events. Fever was reduced, same with the aches and chills. Everything is fairly minor now, but the severe headache continued to to be present untill a second round of cold medication. Still fatigued when writing this at 9:30pm at night despite sleeping the majority of the day.

The next day I had a very strong headache all day and couldn&#39;t get out of bed due to no energy, chills and body aches.  Was in bed sleeping on and off until 4:00pm, or roughly 24 hours after the shot.  Intermittent doses of Tylenol helped with symptoms to allow sleep.  After that 24 hours I felt substantially improved.

Chills and body aches continued. I didn?t feel like I could get warm. Slept on and off throughout the night. Woke up 16 hours after injection and chills were gone and had night sweats. Still really achy all over.  Woke up 20 hours after injection and still had body aches and felt groggy.  Body aches turned into joint aches and still continue 48 hours after injection.  Minor injection site pain started approximately 36 hours after injection.

                                                During the evening around 6pm after I started developing symptoms consistent with the flu.    Fever reached 104 around 8pm.  Uncontrollable chills also were present.  A severe headache followed.  I took fever reducing meds immediately. Confusion and trouble breathing happened during the fever and chills period.  An attempt to go to the hospital was unsuccessful because I lost consciousness while attempting to find phone/car keys.   After I woke up, I felt less confused and could catch my breath, so I decided to take more fever reducing meds and see how I felt in a few hours - this was around 11pm.  Around midnight my fever broke and the chills stopped, but the headache was at the worst it&#39;s been. The headache lasted the entire next day as well.      I wanted to go to the doctor, but was physically unable to and had no one to alert.  I do feel better today.  I have some weak headaches that come and go, along with muscle aches, but I feel that they are minor enough.

Both symptoms are becoming more regular.

I told him that I had a flight later that night and didn?t want to have any side effects on the plane.  He assured me hardly anyone ever has bad reactions to it and was very salesy, not seeming concerned much for my health or my questions, more like he needed to meet a quota. Against my better judgment, I got the shot and was absolutely miserable on the flight and that whole night. I developed a fever, body aches, headache, chills, and fatigue around 8 hrs after receiving my shot. It was one of the worst nights of my life with a fever reaching 103.5, and that was with Tylenol in my system to try to keep the fever down.  I didn?t feel normal for 3 days.

The top half of my spine has discomfort at its best and mild/modern pain the rest of the time. It&#39;s constant. At times my spine feels cold and tingly. Then my entire core gets cold and tingly. I&#39;ve never had back pain or injured my back. This pain is directly related to the vaccine and my experience seems to be outside the norm of side effects subsiding after a couple days.

                                                Pt. requested and received the J&amp;J / Jansen COVID 19 vaccination yesterday at 1317.  While he was being monitored for any adverse reactions, Pt. asked if lightheadedness was a side effect of the shot.  Writer advised that it could be and that everyone is different.  Writer asked if he would like some water, and he declined. Pt. was advised to remove his mask so he could breathe better.  Writer took his pulse while I gathered information.  It was 96.  Pt. reported that he did eat lunch, is drinking plenty of water and fluids.  He relayed he is keeping food down and not having any other issues. Pt. is currently on opiate withdrawal protocol.  Writer asked about his breathing and his chest.  Pt. relayed he was not having difficulty breathing and denied any chest pain at all.  Writer spoke with the Deputy to be sure that we kept an eye on him for a bit longer after his 15 minutes while he was in his cell, due to his lightheadedness.  Pt. was talking with writer, answering questions with ease.  Pt. was not diaphoretic and did have good color.  His pulse was checked again, and it was 84. At 1333, when his 15-minute observation was done, writer went to assist pt. to his feet and informed him that I would escort him back to his cell because he was still feeling a bit uneasy.  When he stood, pt.&#39;s knees buckled, and he knelt to the ground.  Writer helped pt. to lay down.  It was a smooth transition, and he had no injuries to his head or body.  Pt. had what appeared to be a short spell where his body completely tensed for a few seconds, then he relaxed.  He was having a hard time keeping his eyes open, but when prompted, was able to open his eyes.  The Deputy standing by was asked to call for the Public Health Nurses, who had moved on to the next POD to continue vaccinating.  Once on the scene, pt.&#39;s blood pressure was obtained.  142/80.  His pulse was 82.  During this time, it appeared that the tensing episodes became more frequent and a bit more severe.  They were happening approximately every 30 seconds, and lasting between 5 and 10 seconds.  EMS was activated at approximately 1340.  Pt. was awake during these episodes, and communicated with the nurses attending to him. While attending to pt. and waiting for EMS, it was at that time that pt. admitted that this was not the first time this had happened.  He admitted that about a week ago, the same thing happened.  When that new information was explored, pt. reported that his wife thought he had &#34;Serotonin Syndrome&#34;.  Writer asked what meds he was taking on the outside and he reported that he only takes methadone form the clinic.  He denied any other medications or street drug usage.  He does not take any mental health medications at our facility. Collectively, the nurses that attended to him after this episode agreed that this is an isolated incident and not related to receiving the COVID vaccine.  EMS arrived at approximately 1347, and report was given.  He was transported to the hospital for evaluation. Pt. was returned from the hospital at approximately 1600.  The Officer that accompanied him reported to facility that the hospital also believed this was an isolated incident, most likely related to withdrawals.  They did not believe that receiving the vaccine was a factor in today&#39;s events.  Labs were drawn at the hospital, and were all WNL.   Once back in custody, writer spoke briefly with pt..  He was feeling much better, and was sent back to his cell without further incident.

                                                Patient came in for Janssen COVID vaccine that was scheduled electronically online.  All appropriate prescreening was done and patient had no previous allergies or issues.  Patient was instructed to sit in one of the chairs designated for post vaccine observation.  Within minutes (less than 3), patient was very dizzy, clammy (cold sweats), pale and said he did not feel right.  I assisted him to a sitting position on the floor from his chair and we were able to ease him back to a lying down position from there with his head on the floor and feet elevated above heart on a chair.  Patient said that the cold floor actually made him feel better instantly.  At 4:18pm after lying down for about 3 minutes we checked his blood pressure with him still lying down.  It was 110/88 and pulse of 104 (so slightly elevated pulse).  He said he was feeling better and we kept him lying down.  Patient&#39;s wife was also there so she was able to provide information in addition to him doing it also.  She did state that he occasionally had panic attacks and she thought this might be one, the patient was adamant that it was not.  At 4:24 pm we checked his blood pressure again and it was 100/90 and Pulse of 104.  He was feeling quite a bit better so we had him come to a sitting position on the floor and he had not eaten in a while so we got him a granola bar and water.  Pt slowly ate these and begin to feel clammy and sweaty again within 3-4 minutes. We checked his blood pressure again and it was 104/90 and pulse of 100.  He wanted to stay sitting to see if it would pass.  We did continuously observe injection site and screen for any other symptoms of an allergic reaction (nausea, cramping, swelling, and none of these were occurring). Since he was still not feeling well we gave the patient 50mg of benadryl (20 mls of 12.5mg/5ml liquid benadryl) with his approval. After about 10 minutes of sitting total he was still having cold sweats and feeling dizzy so we had him lie back on his back with his feet elevated while the benadryl kicked in.  By 4:50pm he was feeling well enough to sit back up and we got him some wraps and a coke from the cafe to eat.  Pt continued to consistently improve and was ready to leave about 5:20pm.  We advised him and his wife of signs and symptoms of allergic reaction and to have those treated to immediately at urgent care or and ER.   We also told him to follow-up with his PCP.  I had a manager help walk them to their car.  They were very kind and grateful.  I will follow-up with a call tomorrow and again on Friday to make sure he continues to do well.

I couldn&#39;t palm a ball i had for the kids which i normally can easily.  I had chills and nausea as well.    I can&#39;t really remember much from that day and it feels like a big blur.  I woke up the next day feeling very irritable with brain fog.  Today its gotten better and I am hoping tomorrow I will be back to normal.

                                                Started feeling tired and drained around 10pm the same day of receiving the vaccine and then after going to bed around 11pm I felt body aches, chills, and I assume I had a fever. I could simply not get warm or comfortable and tossed and turned for hours. Felt like I had the flu. Finally fell asleep around 2am. Woke up the next morning around 6:30am and took Tylenol but no longer had a fever or chills. I felt drained and tired throughout the whole next day but unsure if that was vaccine related or simply due to lack of sleep. Slept fine that evening and had no other effects.

                                                Got the vaccine around 10:30am, felt ok until around 7:30pm, when I started feeling some nausea and dizziness and weakness. Then progressed to severe shaking chills, fevers, headaches, tingling/electric shock feeling in back of head/neck, muscle aches, mild joint pain, eye discomfort associated with the headaches, poor appetite at first, trouble sleeping, and fatigue; all of which required doses of Tylenol and ibuprofen and cold packs. Symptoms lasted all night and fever broke overnight after finally falling asleep. The next day (3/17) took some more Tylenol and ibuprofen, but the fever and chills subsided. The other symptoms mostly resolved except was still quite tired and felt weak. Also, had cold sweats all day on 3/17. By around 3/18 most all of the symptoms resolved.  Also, had mild soreness at vaccination site throughout.  I?m a physician. If I wasn?t a physician I may have sought medical attention.

                                                Starting at 11 PM (roughly 7 hours after injection), I developed severe flu-like symptoms.  Fever, nausea, chills, and headache.  I was unable to sleep for most of the night.  I had a fever of over 100 degrees.  The symptoms were the worst from 11 PM - 4 AM.  They persisted throughout the next day (thus far), but have lessened in severity.  They are still present, however, 28 hours after initial injection - although roughly 50% less severe.  Acetaminophen seems to help.

                                                Patient was waiting in designated waiting are following vaccine administration. About 5 minutes after vaccine I heard wife calling for help. When I went out to assess patient I found him laying back in chair with his head back, shaking, eyes open, and making fists with his hands. I asked him if he wanted me to call 911. He was able to respnd through clenched teeth that he felt very strange and to call 911. He remained conscious and knew his name. We contacted 911 and I supported pt from opposite side of wife. After a few minutes he calmed down and asked for water, he appeared to be sweating around head area. He took a few sips of water until operator on phone asked us to withhold further liquid until EMTS arrived. He was completely back to normal status within 5 minutes, EMTS came and assessed pt and allowed him to leave of his own accord. After the incident her relayed that similar reactions including full fainting spells have occurred to him in the past when receiving vaccines. this was not indicated on his intake form

Once there he started to read the provided material (EUA, V-Safe) and started to feel anxious.  He said the next thing he knew he was sweating and had tunnel vision.  He wasn&#39;t 100% sure he passed out.  A fellow associate helped him to the ground and elevated his feet.  We got ice for behind his neck, and a cold cloth for his forehead.  We took his blood pressure and it started to come back up.  He waited for about 30 minutes before leaving.  His color had returned and he stated he felt fine.

                                                On Saturday 3/20 I experienced the usual symptoms that were noted. On Monday 3/22 I began to get very dizzy with a heart rate of 150bpm. My blood pressure went up to 210/138 which is extremely abnormal for me. I began to tremor uncontrollably. I thought it was an anxiety attack so I took my Xanax. .50mg. That did not work at all. I experienced nausea and stomach pain. I called 911 and was taken to the hospital where after 4 hours I started feeling better. Tuesday I continued to have tremors. Wednesday the rapid heart rate, stomach pain, and nausea returned. The rest of the week did not get any better. On Saturday 3/27 I slept all day long which again is not normal for me at all. At this point we are 1 full week into the vaccine administration. On Sunday 3/28 I bagan to have the same feeling as the prior Tuesday. Sweating, couldn&#39;t breath, heart rate hit 170 this time. BP was the same, tremors, stomach pain, nausea, dizzyness, and this time my Carbon Dioxide level dropped to 24. This morning 3/29 I woke up with extreme tremors. No dizzyness.

                                                4/1 pt complained of not feeling well after Janssen vaccine. Patient had a syncopal episode while at monitoring tent, patient was trying to lay down on medical bay cot but ended up falling back and passing out. Pt was clammy and pale. Heart rate 42, spO2 99%. Pt oriented to self but not time or place. EMT arrive to further evaluate patient, BP 90/60. heart-rate 55, respirations 18. Patient refused to go to hospital, felt well enough to go back to work. Charge nurse followed up with patient later that day, patient was still at work and said he felt a lot better.   One week later pt reached out on 4/8/2021 to inform on potential side effects. On the night of 4/7/2021 he began to develop hives/rash, and itchiness around the neck and legs. Next morning 4/8/2021 rash had worsened and pt had also developed swelling in the face and wrists. Pt was brought to urgent care where he was treated with prednisone. Pt was prescribed 20mg prednisone tablet twice a day. Charge nurse from day of vaccine followed up with patient, he will continue to take prednisone as prescribed and will follow up with allergist. Pt claims the itchiness is less, as well as, the swelling. Appreciates the follow-up phone-call and claims to feel better, will update us if any changes.

                                                The evening after I received my vaccine I became very cold and couldn&#39;t get warm, to the point of shivering very hard, while at the same time having a fever of 102 F (about 9:30 pm).  The house was 68 F, and I bundled up with thermal underwear, fleece pajamas, a robe, and two extra blankets, but I couldn&#39;t stop feeling cold.  My body was painfully sore the rest of the night; this may have been a reaction from shivering so hard and wearing my muscles out.  Later that night, I woke up in a sweat (maybe 11:30pm) and had to strip out of my clothes down to my underwear, and I couldn&#39;t stop feeling warm.  I slept the rest of the night on top of the covers, and woke up very frequently, probably every half hour.  Each time I woke, I drank half a glass of water (about 6 oz).  The next day my fever was gone and I felt normal temperature wise, but my muscles were all very sore.  I had flu-like symptoms for about a week, a little bit less each day.  It was probably a full week later until I felt normal.

Patient was driving his truck and seemed to veer off, a vaccinator noticed and ran to truck, writer then followed. Initial person told patient to park the truck. Patient appeared to be snoring and un responsive but did put truck in park. Sternal rub was preformed and patient began to come to, seemingly disoriented. Patient was evaluated by EMS in ambulance but no transfer happened. Patient was incontinent as well.  Patient states this happens after he gets injections or lab work done but did not disclose this to the vaccinators at time of vaccine administration.

                                                Hi I was vaccinated Thursday April 8th 2021 at approximately 9:15am. I kept a log so I could share my experience with my friends and family. After vaccination I was fine for a few hours but I randomly got a case of  watery eyes that would last about 15 minutes and then clear up. This happened 4 times over a 9 hour period. Around 9 hours after vaccination I started to feel like I had a cold and my skin all over my body ached to touch and my heart started racing. I felt sunburned and nauseous and went to bed. 13 hours exactly after vaccination I was hit hard with intense chills to the point of teeth chattering and full body shivering. 15 hours after injection I woke up intensely hot and I had a massive headache, full body pain, a tickle deep in my lungs that made me cough, nausea, and a fever of 101. I also was having extreme heart palpitations. I have a laser thermometer and I discovered my fever was 101.5 at my forehead but my neck and chest were 103. I took ibuprofen and kept patting myself with cold wet wash cloths to combat the fever. At this point I debated going to the hospital. I had intense fatigue and I was too weak to move but too sick to sleep. This level of fever and symptoms went on for about a day and a half. Since my vaccination I am still fatigued, I get winded very easily, something small like feeding my dog makes me break out in a sweat, and I need to lay down. I am still weak and fatigued but not to the same level as before and it changes every day. I have a sore throat, headaches, occasionally my body will twitch in random places, fever will pop up and go away, I cough gag and get very weak under any physical stress. I did not have injection site pain out of the ordinary until 48 hours after injection and it felt like a shotgun blast to the arm.. I did have very unusual joint pain from the start. I was injected in my upper left arm, but my lower right ankle was painful and my left wrist...    I am a 38 year old male with treated hypertension, obesity and sleep apnea. My mother who is 65 was vaccinated at the same time as myself and her symptoms were slow onset and much milder than mine but she too has headaches, upset stomach, fatigue, watery eyes, fever, chills, twitches, injection pain, etc.

I was awake for 6 hours in the night with intense chills, sweating, and a temperature of at least 102.  I was unable to take Tylenol until having the chills for 9 hours.  Tylenol helped.  I slept about 20 hours the first day with a fever all day.  I had a fever for about 24 hours.  The following week I was completely exhausted and slept about 12 hours a day.  I am 38 years old and this was the sickest I have been in probably 20 years.  It was bad and that&#39;s why I am reporting it.  I am very thankful to have had the vaccine though.  Thank you all for what you do!

I retire around 12-1 a.m. and consistently awake between 4 and 6 a.m., unable to fall back asleep. This has led to serious drowsiness during the day. Prior to the vaccine, I would regularly sleep until 8 or 9 a.m.  uninterrupted.

                                                I had a severe headache starting in the evening. The pain was constant, dull, and felt like it was coming from the center of the head. I don&#39;t have a history of headaches, so this was unusual. After going to bed at 11PM, I woke up around 2AM from the intense pain. I could not sleep for a couple of hours in the night and I took Nyquil, which helped a little bit. I considered going to the emergency room, but decided to wait until morning to make the decision. I was able to go back to sleep and then slept until 11AM. I woke up feeling weak and groggy, although it may have been due to the Nyquil. The headache was improved and gradually diminished throughout the day. The next morning, it was completely gone and I felt back to normal.

I could not get warm.  My body would go from hot to cold and shiver/spasm in a pattern that lasted about a minute or so.  this pattern of hot cold and shiver/spasm lasted approximately an hour.    when that subsided I started to experience relatively extreme fever and flu symptoms.  I completely sweat through my pajamas.  My entire body ached and hurt like a normal fever flu but more extreme.  Around 2:30AM I took three 500mg acetaminophen, 2 mg Xanax and a 10 mg Valium.  I fell back asleep some time between 3:30 and 4:00AM.  I woke up at 8:30 with most of the symptoms having dissipated.  It&#39;s now 10AM.  I still feel groggy and a little achy in my body, but the fever seems to have subsided.  For now that is about it

                                                Patient received vaccine and immediately felt light-headed and faint. He turned white upon standing and sat back down. He continued to have labored breathing and starting sweating. We were monitoring him and he informed us that it was anxiety related. He couldn&#39;t move his hands and started blacking out. When EMT arrived he started to feel better. They were able to rule out an allergic reaction and it was most likely anxiety related. Patient refused to go to the hospital and was walked out by EMT to make sure he could drive home.

On Sat, May 1, I had an afib episode in the morning. Reset to sinus rhythm the next morning around 2:30am. I spoke with you during the episode.   3. On Mon, May 3, I had brain fog. I?m usually tired after an afib episode. But this seemed different. I?ve never experienced something like this before. But I chalked it out to the after effects of the afib and moved on. 4. On Fri, May 7, I started having the stiffness in my right calf. I checked in with you that weekend to make sure it wasn?t a clot. After we spoke I think we ruled out a clot.  5. In addition, I?ve developed some added symptoms since then: (i) Sweaty feet. (ii) Pins and needles sensation in feet.  (iii) Tightness in the arch of the right foot. (iv) Feet and hands feel sensitive to cold.  (v) Burning sensation in feet and left hand.  (vi) Mild headache mostly felt in the left temple.  (vii) A pulling feeling on the left side of the face. (viii) A feeling that if I close my eyes, I may faint.

Went into the Pagosa Medical Group Urgent Care the next day to get checked out.  EKG came back normal.  Doc and I both thought it was gas, but we wanted to be sure it wasn&#39;t heart related.

I didn?t have goosebumps, but felt cold from the inside, if that makes sense.   The only way I could get comfortable was to sleep in a bathtub in hot water for 4-5 hours.  I then went to my bed and slept for another 5 hours.    I called out of work Friday.

                                                Within a few minutes of receiving the vaccination I lost consciousness. It was a drive-through vaccination clinic by the Health department. My vehicle rolled into a cement and metal bar/side of the building&#39;s exit at a slow speed. The EMS at the scene stated that my heartbeat was irregular, varying between bradycardia and tachycardia. When they checked my blood pressure inside the ambulance they stated it was very low. About 15-20 minutes later I tried to sit up and was still unstable and unable to keep myself upright without assistance. I was then taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital&#39;s emergency department. Nothing notable or unusual was found when I was checked out there. Within a couple hours I felt well enough to go home. Once home I had a headache, fatigue, mild dizziness, and nausea with physical activity. The following day I had a headache, muscle aches, pain at the injection site, and nausea with extended physical activity. Today I have pain in the arm where I received the vaccine and a mild headache.

                                                This was one of the worst headaches I&#39;ve ever had in my life. Migraine headaches run in my family so I&#39;m no stranger to them, which is why it is particularly surprising. Along with the headache I had severe flu symptoms - body ache from head to toe, legs toward the end. Abdominal pain toward end. I was breathing heavily throughout, except for an hour or two of bad sleep. It was almost certainly a high fever, but I didn&#39;t measure. Chills, sweating. Complete misery. The extremely painful cycle lasted about 10 hours before it started to recede. I felt better close to 100% within 48 hours. I&#39;m reporting this because I&#39;ve realized that most people have &#34;mild flu like symptoms&#34; while my symptoms were extreme. If I had any other health issues (I don&#39;t) it seems obvious that it could have created a bigger problem. I didn&#39;t go to a hospital, but I should have, in hindsight.

                                                Monday, April 12th, around 2pm I started to develop extreme stomach pain, as well as noticed some shortness of breath or elevated heart rate. The stomach pain worsened after dinner. I  assumed it was something I ate, which was the same thing I eat every day, and expected it was some type of gas that would resolve itself naturally. I went to bed in lots of pain. I didn&#39;t sleep well due to the issues and woke up still in pain in my mid stomach, mostly on the left side. I called the nurse who did an intake and advised that I go to the ER (Tuesday, April 13th)

I was driving to work and had to keep pulling over because I felt dizzy. I ended up going to the Dr. and had test ran and they said I was extremely dehydrated and I didn&#39;t understand because I drink a lot of water. they hooked me up an IV and gave me fluids. They said I was Healthy just extremely dehydrated it.  My injection site was kind of tender but nothing more. I&#39;m still having issues. I&#39;m just always thirsty no matter how much water I drink.

                                                I developed a very itchy rash on my back, hands, feet, arms and what felt like everywhere.  The just today stopped.  The rash lasted about 8-10 days I would say.  It got worse over the course of a week and then started getting better.   Someone suggested I take an anti-inflammatory, because my hands were swelling and it was difficult to work at the computer.  That seemed to help immediately or it could&#39;ve just started to go away on its own.  Regardless, I&#39;ve kept the twice daily naproxen for the past 4 days and things seem to be all better now.   My wife suggested I report my reaction.    The small red bumps were scattered mostly on my back, feet and hands.  They looked very similar to shingles but without the big red splotches only the small red bumps.  As they were forming they appeared to be sun blisters and then turned bright red.  Extremely itchy and kept me up scratching at night and scratching all day.

There is a constant pressure in my head that moves around all areas, from the back base of the head, to the sides, temples, forehead/sinus regions. It is from waking until sleeping. Not incredibly intense, but constant. I have difficulty sleeping through the night and have not slept well since, either. I have also experience blurred vision. I have also experience bruising on various parts of my body including my arm, abdomen, and toe nails. My quality of life has suffered tremendously and I wish I hadn&#39;t gotten the vaccine.
