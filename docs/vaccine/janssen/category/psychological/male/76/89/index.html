                                                Husband began expressing &#34;I&#39;m tired&#34; which was out of the ordinary on May 1, 2021.  Again on May 2 and 3.  On May 4 he was really weak, moving much more slowly than normal, complaining of sinus headache above left eye, sleeping longer and more than normal, brain fog and confusion, not able to do normal activities.  This impairment has continued through May 11 with no improvement from one day to the next.  Visited his Dr to get checked on May 11 due to our concern over how long this was lasting.   He has had no fever but some chills here and there.  Dr checked everything she could think of and requested blood tests which we have not heard about yet.  Extreme fatigue was the major symptom.  Today, May 12, he feels better, moving around faster and doing some normal activities but still tires easily and must rest.

That night: halucinatory dreams, woke up  and had difficulty with orientation - room spinning, difficulty walking came back to bed, bed spinning.  Got up later room spinning vertically - took several minutes to settle down.  This problem has gotten worse as the days go by.  This morning, dizziness persists longer than before, feeling of strong nausea, near vomiting, cannot walk in a straight line.  Fear of falling.   These are symptoms of vertigo I believe.  Should I go to a doctor?  Feeling that this will get worse.  Difficulty concentrating.  Quite an unsettling and scary experience.

March17, I got sick - I had a bad stomach ache. Friday, I thought the doctors would be gone. March 21st, I went to the clinic and they sent me right to the hospital for a scan and I had emergency surgery to remove my appendix - but it did get put off from when I went in because of all the emergencies in front of me with the ambulances coming in from accidents. He said it had burst  by the time the surgeon got to me with the surgery and they gave me antibiotics and he said he poked three holes in my belly. Still recovering - I have follow up tomorrow. I am doing real well. My stomach doesn&#39;t hurt and I am not taking pain medication any longer.
