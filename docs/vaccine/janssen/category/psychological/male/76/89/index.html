On May 4 he was really weak, moving much more slowly than normal, complaining of sinus headache above left eye, sleeping longer and more than normal, brain fog and confusion, not able to do normal activities.  This impairment has continued through May 11 with no improvement from one day to the next.  Visited his Dr to get checked on May 11 due to our concern over how long this was lasting.   He has had no fever but some chills here and there.  Dr checked everything she could think of and requested blood tests which we have not heard about yet.  Extreme fatigue was the major symptom.  Today, May 12, he feels better, moving around faster and doing some normal activities but still tires easily and must rest.

                                                Symtoms were first noticed on Tuesday June 8th about two oclock in the afternoon when I noticed a slight burning sensation on my right shoulder. I had presumed this to be sunburn. The next day I noticed a few blisters and additional discomfort and subsequently applied OTC lotion. As the days progressed it looked as though it was poison-ivy as opposed to sunburn. Again applied OTC medications to relieve the pain. By Monday, June 14th, the situation had progressed in severity, necessitating a visit to the emergency room. I was examened by DR. who diagnoeded the problem as &#39;shingles&#39;, not poison-ivy. He subsequetly dianosed taking ValACYclovir for seven-days then recommended that I follow-up with a Primary Care Provider in seven-days. The valACHclovir helped stop the spread of the problem, but did&#39;t do much to relieve the discomfort. The following Tuesday, June 22nd I met with Dr. of the Health Clinic adjacent to the hospital. After vitals were all taken, we had a question and answer session where it was determined that nothing else could be done for Me except for the shingles to &#39;run their course&#39;. Retuning home I continued to administer OTC lotions and sprays to help reduce some of the burning sensations experienced around the face, ear, neck, and shoulder which was becoming more severe. After several days of not being able to sleep or get any relief from the &#39;burning and stinging&#39;, I decided it was necessary to get a second opinion. I then notified another hospital, that I would be arriving for an examination that afternoon, July 12th. at approximately 2pm. Upon arrival and completion of completion of all vital signs by medical staff, I was met with a doctor. Upon examination and understanding the symptoms experienced, she prescribed &#39;Gabapentin&#39; to help reduce the &#39;burning sensations&#39; and &#39;Prednisone&#39; to help reduce the &#39;skin rash and swelling&#39;. Returning home and starting the prescribed meds, I did notice some immediate relief from the Gabapentin, which for the first time in more than a week or so, I was able to get a nights sleep. I didn&#39;t notice any changes taking the prednisone and had to presume that it helped stop the spead of the rash from going further.   As I prepare this overview, it is now July 18th and once again experiencing severe pain and tighening of muscles around the face, neck and shoulder. Pain feels like &#39;stinging needles&#39;, &#39;miniture electical shocks&#39; that course thru from above the ear, down thru the face neck and over to the chin-throat&#39; area. Pain lasts but a brief second, but very painfull, making sleep impossible. Touching any area on the right side of my body from the scalp, across the face and neck down to my shoulder, back and collar bone result in extreme &#39;burning sensations&#39;. I have a 12:45 pm appointmet at the hospital on Tuesday July 20th to meet with Dr. who will become my Primary Care Provider. I can only hope that we&#39;re able to come-up with some solution that will easy the severity of the &#39;stinging sensations and burning&#39; that will allow me to sleep and get beck to resuming nornal activity.  Up until this event, I had been an actrive, healthy, 78yo man who had never been sick nor been to a Dr. in over 20 years, which I contribute to the clean, healthy environment here. In summary, it is my firm belief that in view of recent media reports about the Guillian-Barr symtoms which affect the nerves and muscles, it is the result of having received the Johnson&amp;Johnson vaccine that contributed to the onset of my developing shingles. Because I had not had the Shingles vaccine at any time, it might be advisable for those that are beyond a certain age who have not had the shingles vaccine NOT get the Johnson&amp;Johnson vaccine if other alternatives are available.

                                                Patient suffered a tiny brain bleed and subdural hematoma and fell from our boat to the pier on the afternoon of April 17.  I drove him to the ER for evaluation where a CT scan revealed the brain bleed.  He was subsequently transported to the emergency unit that evening.  He was disoriented and suffered a concussion as well.  He had daily blood work and was treated with Levetiracetam for 5 days post discharge on 4/22.

                                                Per Regulatory Authority it is to be reported if patient gets COVID if fully vaccinated.  Per MD note 1.  Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure:  This is in a patient with COVID pneumonia.  The patient was placed on supplemental oxygen.  The plan is for the patient to use supplemental oxygen with oxygen by nasal cannula up to 6 L and if oxygen saturation falls below 90% on 6 L oxygen by nasal cannula, he will be transitioned to high-flow oxygen.  However, if he is on maximal support with high-flow oxygen with oxygen saturation falling below 90%, the patient should be placed on BiPAP and transferred to the ICU.  The patient is a full code. 2.  COVID pneumonia:  This in a patient who apparently received his Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine 3 weeks ago.  The patient started on treatment with remdesivir.  He will get steroids.  He is prescribed Tessalon Perles and Robitussin with codeine as needed for coughing.  He may be considered for potentially other treatments in the setting of his COVID pneumonia, especially if his respiratory status deteriorates.  We will closely follow up in the COVID unit after admission. 3.  Alteration of mental status and encephalopathy:  This in a patient who is hypoglycemic.  However, part of his encephalopathy related to his COVID infection and volume depletion.  He is being volume repleted and treated for his condition.  He will have frequent neurologic checks done after admission. 4.  Generalized weakness and deconditioning:  This is in a volume depleted patient with COVID.  His COVID will be appropriately treated and he will be volume repleted.  He will need to work with physical and occupational therapy towards the end of the hospitalization. 5.  Congestive heart failure, systolic plus diastolic dysfunction:  The patient does not have any evidence of acute congestive heart failure at the moment.  However, we will take care to prevent volume overload in this patient, who requires volume repletion in the setting of his volume depletion. 6.  Volume depletion:  The patient will get another liter of IV fluids after admission at 80 mL per hour as tolerated.  The goal is to avoid excessive IV fluid administration in this patient with COVID pneumonia.

That night: halucinatory dreams, woke up  and had difficulty with orientation - room spinning, difficulty walking came back to bed, bed spinning.  Got up later room spinning vertically - took several minutes to settle down.  This problem has gotten worse as the days go by.  This morning, dizziness persists longer than before, feeling of strong nausea, near vomiting, cannot walk in a straight line.  Fear of falling.   These are symptoms of vertigo I believe.  Should I go to a doctor?  Feeling that this will get worse.  Difficulty concentrating.  Quite an unsettling and scary experience.

March17, I got sick - I had a bad stomach ache. Friday, I thought the doctors would be gone. March 21st, I went to the clinic and they sent me right to the hospital for a scan and I had emergency surgery to remove my appendix - but it did get put off from when I went in because of all the emergencies in front of me with the ambulances coming in from accidents. He said it had burst  by the time the surgeon got to me with the surgery and they gave me antibiotics and he said he poked three holes in my belly. Still recovering - I have follow up tomorrow. I am doing real well. My stomach doesn&#39;t hurt and I am not taking pain medication any longer.

He reports that the driver called for help and they were able to help him to the couch. He was weak but able to use the walker to get around. reports that he had not slept during that time and reports having some delusions due to lack of sleep.  He does report that he has a history of muscle weakness, but never this bad and is now having to use a walker all of the time. He denies going to the ER, hospital or doctor for treatment and that he is slowly recovering but still having to use a walker.

                                                I developed fluid filled blisters which itched to an extreme  located on my buttocks, groin, and upper legs.  Painful, constant  extreme itching disrupting sleeping and sitting .  Had an almost three week waiut to get an appointment with my primary physician who then referred me to a skin specialst with another 4 week wait to get my appointment with him.   He made a visual diagnosis of  Bullous pemphigoid and took two biopsies and a blood draw.  I am still waiting for results and have a June 14,, 2021 appointment to remove biopsy stitches and get his report.
