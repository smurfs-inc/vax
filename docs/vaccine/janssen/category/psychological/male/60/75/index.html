                                                I had some fatigue the first couple of days but nothing that kept me from going to work - just took it slower and easier those days. The tinnitus started on 19th - ear pain on the right ear. I woke up that morning, I had pain. When I touched it I had pain on the front of my right ear.  ( It appears to be coming from my right ear.) I took some Zyrtec D to see if that would help me and I took that for two days and that seemed to help but then the ringing started. I notice it more at night when it&#39;s quiet or when I&#39;m working myself doing my maintenance work at rental units. I thought it was clogging of ear and so I was going to go to the doctor but I did ear drops and flushed for two days. It didn&#39;t subside anything with the ringing - I might be able to hear a little better. I don&#39;t have pain anymore as to the touch but I still have the tinnitus - the ringing in the ear - that constant sound. It has been continuing it seems to not be as bad but others it is. When I go to bed or when I wake up at night the ringing there it&#39;s hard to go back to sleep. I have an appt with the Ears, nose and throat doctor. My hearing doesn&#39;t seem to be affected, but I can&#39;t say for sure if it&#39;s any different - I&#39;m left handed so I use my left ear in the phone.

Was able to sleep, and by morning the fever was down to 100 degrees.  I still felt very tired and headachy.  I got up and had a small dish of cereal and then slept most of the morning.  By the afternoon the fever was gone, however had a headache and fatigue.  Took a Tylenol about 4 pm (24 hours after receiving the injection).  Headache cleared by the end of the day.  Still somewhat fatigued  72 hours after receiving the injection.  Stayed hydrated through the whole period.

I exercise 3 times week, dont smoke, drink very little alcohol consumption. I am 5 feet 9 inches tall and weigh 165 pounds. My blood pressure is 130/80.

Arms had better function and control than legs but with marked weakness.  Day 2: Some improvement. Able to go to work but still have fatigue and leg weakness persist. It takes additional mental and physical effort to walk. Walking does not feel automatic or safe like it was before. Still have high level of fatigue. Symptoms improve  some later in the afternoon.

                                                After a few hours starting feeling like I had the flu. Fever continued to rise and topped out at 100.7 around 9 pm. Had severe chills where  I was visibly  shaking.  Fever broke around 2 am and was severely sweating.  Chills had mostly stopped by this time. Still continued with a slight fever until it once again broke around 10:30 am. Continued to get better throughout the rest of the day and finally returned to work on Thursday morning.

That night, 3/27 around 9 PM I began to feel cold as if I was running a fever and started having body aches.  I did not take my temperature to see if I actually did have a fever.  The symptoms lasted most of the night.   The next day, 3/28 I had the flu-like symptoms again at night.

Received J&amp;J vaccine at 3 weeks ago. His current neurological examination and clinical history is suggestive of GBS  NEUROLOGICAL EXAM:  MSE: A&#43;Ox 3 Language: no aphasia   CRANIAL NERVES:  2nd CN: bilateral pupils are equal round and reaction to light, visual field-full 3rd,4th and 6th CN: EOM-I 5th CN: no sensory deficite 7th CN: face: symmetric, not able to smile or blowing air or holding water 8th CN: hearing loss: no 9, 10th CN: no dysarthria, palate movement:normal 11th CN: no neck weakness 12th CN: tongue: middle, no atrophy   MOTOR EXAM:  Tone: normal  Strength: 4&#43;/5 at bilateral UEs, 4 Pt symptoms started very early. Narrative from family below:  &#34;Day 1 (The day he took the vaccine): My father was complaining of very heavy chest pressure (said he felt like his chest was being pushed down with force.) He felt really tired and had a nasty headache.   Day 2 He began to feel tingles in his legs and arms. Said he felt sore and had mild pain around his back, feet, legs, hands, and arms. The headache came in and out.   Day 3 He began feeling more severe pains in both legs &#43; headache. More tingling around his face, lips, and jaw.  Day 4 Severe pain continued around his entire body. Had an episode where he lost vision from 1 eye (he described it as blurry vision) felt like he was going blind from one eye.  Day 5 Could barely stand on his two feet and could no longer go to work. He stayed in bed and then hospital visits began. My mom took him to emergency for the first time.  I was able to get details of the location where he was vaccinated and onsite contact information. The info is below:

I wasn&#39;t sure if it was ok to take otc pain meds so I waited until morning (9:30 am) to call my doc. Fever had subsided, but still had intense headache.  Doc told me to take 2 extra strength Tylenol which I did. Headache was relieved within 45 minutes.  I was able to sleep.  Felt much better afterwards although still struggled with fatigue and mild headache for approx 80 hours following vaccine.

                                                On Friday, March 12, 2021, at the pharmacy I had an 8:00 am appointment to receive the Johnson &amp; Johnson?s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. I received my vaccine in the left arm but the injection seemed to me (and my wife) to be in an odd location, which was very high up on the shoulder near the shoulder joint. Things seemed fine until Saturday evening when I started to feel some tightness in my left trapezius between my scapula and my occipital bone. By Sunday morning that same area was very tight and painful; what we used call a ?crick.? Sunday afternoon I began to feel some sharp pain in my left shoulder joint. I had very little sleep on Sunday night and by Monday morning I had significant pain in what felt like my humerus.  I made an appointment with a chiropractor  for Monday afternoon and he suggested the vaccine shot might have started an inflammation that led to the tight trapezius, which in turn was causing the cervical spinal nerves to react, thus causing the pain in my arm. At this point I was in a lot of pain and the pain was moving further down toward my elbow. The chiropractor did his usual things and told me to put ice on it and take OCT Ibuprofen and or Naproxen. I was a bit better on Tuesday and decided to attend a three-day pastors? retreat. By Tuesday afternoon the pain had expanded to just below my elbow. I consulted with a doctor friend and he thought it was likely that I was having a reaction to the vaccine and that it would pass. He as concerned to hear of the odd location of my injection. I had another sleepless night and on Wednesday I noticed that the ends of my left thumb and index finder were numb and by that night the numbness had expanded to include most of my index finder. The other arm and shoulder pain continued but varied in intensity. On Wednesday morning I called my wife and asked her to come get me at the retreat and that afternoon I called my doctor&#39;s office office and made an appointment for Thursday morning (3-18-21). I&#39;m  feeling the cumulative effects of the pain and fatigue. My overall pain level is a little less but still present, as is the numbness in my index finger and thumb. My doctor suggested the nerve inflammation was a reaction tot he vaccine.

                                                I spoke to patient by phone on Saturday morning around 9:20am. He was concerned about the fatigue, nausea, headache, chills, and muscle aches he had the night before. He felt better when I spoke to him. He wanted to know when those side effects would go away finally. Since I had the Moderna vaccine I said 24 to 36 hours. But I didn&#39;t know about the J&amp;J vaccine. We disconnect the call at 9:40am Saturday morning. After the call at some point he fixed lunch or dinner and stopped eating before finishing his meal. He had left the food on the table and in the pans he fixed it in. Very unusual for him.  The patient then went to his room where is was found Monday 3/22/21 around noon in his bed laying on his chest (he hated to lie on his chest) by the police and the HR officer from his work.   The HR officer had called my other brother around 11:15am on 3/22 /21 to ask if we had heard from the patient because he had not reported to work or phoned in. He has passed sometime between noon on Saturday till Sunday evening alone at his residence. He had towels and a trash can beside his bed when he was found.  The coroner call it death by natural causes and would not do an autopsy when even asked by his PCP.

During the night I woke up overheated and bathed in sweat. Got up to go to the bathroom for BM but was nauseous, feeling need to vomit at the same time. After BM I stood and still felt need to  do one or the other or both when I passed out. Wife came upstairs and found me sitting up against the corner wall. She was able to shake me awake while calling 911. I was groggy but aware I was still nauseous and  stayed down next to toilet until stomach settled. I came downstairs and EMTs arrived. Took blood pressure. Result was it was low. Took EKG and that was normal. Second  blood pressure test  showed that I rebounded.  When offered I felt it unnecessary to go to hospital.

Then waves of oversensitivity with knee and foot joints hurting as if arthritis, and this lasted most of the night. I also experienced strange hallucinations in the night as if I had a high fever but I don&#39;t believe I had a fever, and I also had a migraine and neck pain. The arm where the vaccine was applied is fine and not sore at all.  I also have a slight soreness in my stomach as if I had been coughing for a while, which was not the case.  It is now 11:34 AM the following day and I believe I&#39;m getting back to my normal self but it sure was a rough night and I though you should be aware.

Had a 101.5 degree temperature all night which went down to 100 in the morning and back up to 101.2 later on the 14th.  I had nausea and extreme pain all over my body and restlessness.  it got a little better the next day but still feels like I have the flu. I had covid back in march of 2020 and was tested for the antibodies at the end of August.  There is a horrific dearth of research on people who have had covid and whether they should get the vaccines. It is disgraceful, and the next time I will listen to my gut which told me NOT to get vaccinated!

About 10 days post vaccine, the symptoms returned with a ferocious energy.  The pain in my muscles and joints is so severe that I can&#39;t roll over in bed, have difficulty walking, and getting on and off the toilet. It interrupts my sleep so that I play musical bed-chair-couch throughout the night.  Needless to say, it exacerbates the level of pain and fatigue I&#39;m already experiencing.  It is life debilitating as I cannot participate in my usual daily activities of walking, hiking, gardening, biking, etc.  As a result of joint and muscle stiffness, I am also now experiencing headaches. These extreme conditions have persisted from March 23- April 9...and I don&#39;t see relief in the future.

The patient&#39;s wife, reported to hospice team that he had been sleepy during the day and had received a dose of Ativan  earlier that morning (PRN medication at 0750). The primary hospice nurse reported wife noted he became more lethargic throughout the day after vaccination with his condition worsening at 1720; at that time his blood sugar levels were noted to be low at &#34;47&#34; but patient was alert enough to drink orange juice, eat ice cream. The patient continued to deteriorate so MD was consulted and he was transported to the ED where he later expired at 1930.

                                                On Thursday, March 18, I had some slight dizziness during the day. After going to bed that night I woke up and the night light in the smoke alarm on the ceiling appeared to be spinning. I sat, then stood, grabbling walls for support and attempted to reach my recliner. At that point I was severely dizzy, completely lost any sense of balance and collapsed into the chair. I could not stand or walk. After 20 minutes, I asked my wife to call an ambulance. I did not think she would be able to get me into our car. The paramedics ran an EKG and tested me for a stroke. Both were normal. I was transported to the ER. The doctor gave me Meclizine. Had a CT scan of my brain, and blood work. All results normal. Dizziness resolved. They tested my balance and then released me at 3:30 a.m. on March 19. I was tired that day, but did not need further medication. During that night, as I turned over in bed, the vertigo returned. I took a Meclizine and went to the recliner for the remainder of the night. I am feeling somewhat fuzzy today, March 20. Not sure how long this will continue, or if it is related to my Covid vaccination. However, I am reporting it in the event that others may be experiencing this problem as well.
