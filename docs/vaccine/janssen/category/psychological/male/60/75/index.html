                                                I had some fatigue the first couple of days but nothing that kept me from going to work - just took it slower and easier those days. The tinnitus started on 19th - ear pain on the right ear. I woke up that morning, I had pain. When I touched it I had pain on the front of my right ear.  ( It appears to be coming from my right ear.) I took some Zyrtec D to see if that would help me and I took that for two days and that seemed to help but then the ringing started. I notice it more at night when it&#39;s quiet or when I&#39;m working myself doing my maintenance work at rental units. I thought it was clogging of ear and so I was going to go to the doctor but I did ear drops and flushed for two days. It didn&#39;t subside anything with the ringing - I might be able to hear a little better. I don&#39;t have pain anymore as to the touch but I still have the tinnitus - the ringing in the ear - that constant sound. It has been continuing it seems to not be as bad but others it is. When I go to bed or when I wake up at night the ringing there it&#39;s hard to go back to sleep. I have an appt with the Ears, nose and throat doctor. My hearing doesn&#39;t seem to be affected, but I can&#39;t say for sure if it&#39;s any different - I&#39;m left handed so I use my left ear in the phone.

It took a full month for the pain to stop - especially if pressed on. After two weeks, the pain in the arm migrated to the central right back. I could sleep on my right side only. Lasted about two days and then subsided. About a week or so after that, I was getting a throbbing pain on my left calf. That lasted a couple of days where it would intermittently start throbbing. I called the doctor. When I went in the symptoms has subsided but the doctor  (on April 13) said to do an ultrasound if it returns. It didn&#39;t return so I have not had an ultrasound.

These symptoms began 3/17 and have persisted every day since in varying severity. Sometimes the tremors last for more than 20 minutes straight. The patient was seen in the emergency department on 3/26/21 but the hospital notes are unavailable to the pharmacy at this time. Per patient, he had an MRI and no other tests and was given a prescription for ondansetron for nausea and discharged. The patient believes he was not adequately assessed and is still suffering from symptoms. He has a follow up with a primary physician 5/28/21 which is the soonest he was able to be referred.

                                                After a few hours starting feeling like I had the flu. Fever continued to rise and topped out at 100.7 around 9 pm. Had severe chills where  I was visibly  shaking.  Fever broke around 2 am and was severely sweating.  Chills had mostly stopped by this time. Still continued with a slight fever until it once again broke around 10:30 am. Continued to get better throughout the rest of the day and finally returned to work on Thursday morning.

That night, 3/27 around 9 PM I began to feel cold as if I was running a fever and started having body aches.  I did not take my temperature to see if I actually did have a fever.  The symptoms lasted most of the night.   The next day, 3/28 I had the flu-like symptoms again at night.

Received J&amp;J vaccine at 3 weeks ago. His current neurological examination and clinical history is suggestive of GBS  NEUROLOGICAL EXAM:  MSE: A&#43;Ox 3 Language: no aphasia   CRANIAL NERVES:  2nd CN: bilateral pupils are equal round and reaction to light, visual field-full 3rd,4th and 6th CN: EOM-I 5th CN: no sensory deficite 7th CN: face: symmetric, not able to smile or blowing air or holding water 8th CN: hearing loss: no 9, 10th CN: no dysarthria, palate movement:normal 11th CN: no neck weakness 12th CN: tongue: middle, no atrophy   MOTOR EXAM:  Tone: normal  Strength: 4&#43;/5 at bilateral UEs, 4 Pt symptoms started very early. Narrative from family below:  &#34;Day 1 (The day he took the vaccine): My father was complaining of very heavy chest pressure (said he felt like his chest was being pushed down with force.) He felt really tired and had a nasty headache.   Day 2 He began to feel tingles in his legs and arms. Said he felt sore and had mild pain around his back, feet, legs, hands, and arms. The headache came in and out.   Day 3 He began feeling more severe pains in both legs &#43; headache. More tingling around his face, lips, and jaw.  Day 4 Severe pain continued around his entire body. Had an episode where he lost vision from 1 eye (he described it as blurry vision) felt like he was going blind from one eye.  Day 5 Could barely stand on his two feet and could no longer go to work. He stayed in bed and then hospital visits began. My mom took him to emergency for the first time.  I was able to get details of the location where he was vaccinated and onsite contact information. The info is below:

Sometimes I was unable to sleep and over the two weeks took 2 or 3 Advil per night to get to sleep. After about two weeks the pain receded and has gone and stayed away. But no surface indications on skin, no restrictions in range of motion...just persistent, deep, ache.  I have subsequently spoken with a friend who also took the J&amp;J shot and reports the SAME symptoms.

I wasn&#39;t sure if it was ok to take otc pain meds so I waited until morning (9:30 am) to call my doc. Fever had subsided, but still had intense headache.  Doc told me to take 2 extra strength Tylenol which I did. Headache was relieved within 45 minutes.  I was able to sleep.  Felt much better afterwards although still struggled with fatigue and mild headache for approx 80 hours following vaccine.

                                                I received the shot and waited there about 15-20 minutes after before returning home.  No issues at that time.  About an hour after the vaccination, I began to lose my mental function.  My brain/mind were not functioning properly - to the point that I could hardly remember my name, let alone do anything on the computer that I was attempting to do.  At about that same time, I had a feeling of near complete exhaustion come over me, to the point of thinking I might faint at any moment. I went to my bedroom and laid down.  I fell asleep shortly there after and woke up approx 2.5 hours later.  After waking, I felt normal again.  I was able to process my thoughts and did not feel faint or exhausted any more.  It has been 1 month today since having the shot.  I have not felt any additional adverse affects to this point, other than the several hours after the shot. On a side note, I had not been sick prior to the shot or in the several months leading up to the shot.  I have also not been sick since the shot.  It was only the several hours on the day of the shot.

                                                On Friday, March 12, 2021, at the pharmacy I had an 8:00 am appointment to receive the Johnson &amp; Johnson?s Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine. I received my vaccine in the left arm but the injection seemed to me (and my wife) to be in an odd location, which was very high up on the shoulder near the shoulder joint. Things seemed fine until Saturday evening when I started to feel some tightness in my left trapezius between my scapula and my occipital bone. By Sunday morning that same area was very tight and painful; what we used call a ?crick.? Sunday afternoon I began to feel some sharp pain in my left shoulder joint. I had very little sleep on Sunday night and by Monday morning I had significant pain in what felt like my humerus.  I made an appointment with a chiropractor  for Monday afternoon and he suggested the vaccine shot might have started an inflammation that led to the tight trapezius, which in turn was causing the cervical spinal nerves to react, thus causing the pain in my arm. At this point I was in a lot of pain and the pain was moving further down toward my elbow. The chiropractor did his usual things and told me to put ice on it and take OCT Ibuprofen and or Naproxen. I was a bit better on Tuesday and decided to attend a three-day pastors? retreat. By Tuesday afternoon the pain had expanded to just below my elbow. I consulted with a doctor friend and he thought it was likely that I was having a reaction to the vaccine and that it would pass. He as concerned to hear of the odd location of my injection. I had another sleepless night and on Wednesday I noticed that the ends of my left thumb and index finder were numb and by that night the numbness had expanded to include most of my index finder. The other arm and shoulder pain continued but varied in intensity. On Wednesday morning I called my wife and asked her to come get me at the retreat and that afternoon I called my doctor&#39;s office office and made an appointment for Thursday morning (3-18-21). I&#39;m  feeling the cumulative effects of the pain and fatigue. My overall pain level is a little less but still present, as is the numbness in my index finger and thumb. My doctor suggested the nerve inflammation was a reaction tot he vaccine.

He was very confused for about 3 hours.  I called our doctor and he advised me to take him to the ER, it took me 45 minutes to get him there and by that time his memory was back.  He has never had a problem like this before and I thought he might be having a stroke or something.  there was definitely something severely wrong.

My wife was asking me questions and I couldn&#39;t answer wedding date, her DOB, etc.  The symptoms disappeared after 10-15 minutes but I felt almost the same as the minimal symptoms I had with my Covid positive, January 14.

                                                I spoke to patient by phone on Saturday morning around 9:20am. He was concerned about the fatigue, nausea, headache, chills, and muscle aches he had the night before. He felt better when I spoke to him. He wanted to know when those side effects would go away finally. Since I had the Moderna vaccine I said 24 to 36 hours. But I didn&#39;t know about the J&amp;J vaccine. We disconnect the call at 9:40am Saturday morning. After the call at some point he fixed lunch or dinner and stopped eating before finishing his meal. He had left the food on the table and in the pans he fixed it in. Very unusual for him.  The patient then went to his room where is was found Monday 3/22/21 around noon in his bed laying on his chest (he hated to lie on his chest) by the police and the HR officer from his work.   The HR officer had called my other brother around 11:15am on 3/22 /21 to ask if we had heard from the patient because he had not reported to work or phoned in. He has passed sometime between noon on Saturday till Sunday evening alone at his residence. He had towels and a trash can beside his bed when he was found.  The coroner call it death by natural causes and would not do an autopsy when even asked by his PCP.

Pt coded in the ambulance and brought back. Pt was coherent upon arriving to the ER.  He had to be intubated and bagged and died about 15 minutes later.  Pt had blood work which was totally out of whack.   Family was told they did not understand what had happened to him.

I had Diarrhea and a low grade fever for one day and I couldn&#39;t concentrate. I started to have symptoms of depression that I do not normally have. I felt restless and I had trouble sleeping. I was very aggravated, and I was having repetitive thoughts. I had trouble working and my brain was a little.  It went on for two weeks. I have had a few more episodes since then but it is much better.

                                                Body chills. In going to bed I had heavy clothing, bathrobe  and multiple blankets to offset the chills. During the night I woke up overheated and bathed in sweat. Got up to go to the bathroom for BM but was nauseous, feeling need to vomit at the same time. After BM I stood and still felt need to  do one or the other or both when I passed out. Wife came upstairs and found me sitting up against the corner wall. She was able to shake me awake while calling 911. I was groggy but aware I was still nauseous and  stayed down next to toilet until stomach settled. I came downstairs and EMTs arrived. Took blood pressure. Result was it was low. Took EKG and that was normal. Second  blood pressure test  showed that I rebounded.  When offered I felt it unnecessary to go to hospital.

Then waves of oversensitivity with knee and foot joints hurting as if arthritis, and this lasted most of the night. I also experienced strange hallucinations in the night as if I had a high fever but I don&#39;t believe I had a fever, and I also had a migraine and neck pain. The arm where the vaccine was applied is fine and not sore at all.  I also have a slight soreness in my stomach as if I had been coughing for a while, which was not the case.  It is now 11:34 AM the following day and I believe I&#39;m getting back to my normal self but it sure was a rough night and I though you should be aware.

                                                By 10:00 pm that evening I got Chills, fever, muscle aches, headache, nausea and low back pain.  Stayed home from work for 1 or 2 days.  Felt better in all ways except my low back got very, very painful.  I asked my wife to buy me a walker to take to work because I had difficulty walking the distance from the parking lot to inside my office.  Also used the walker at work.  My boss said to go home, it looks like you&#39;re in  pain.  Saw Dr. on Monday March 15 because the low back was getting worse.  He prescribed muscle relaxors and anti-inflammatory medicine.  Called the next day asked for something stronger for pain because worse.  Nurse responded to continue on existing meds.  Went to Chiropractor on both March 16 and 18 without back pain relief.  On March 19 went to urgent care, got X-ray and pain meds.  MRI done 2 days later on March 21st which revealed a spinal abcess. Admitted to Hospital, surgery done to remove spinal abcess on March 22.  Bacteremia, laminectomies in L3,4,5 S1 to relive spinal cord pressure.  Puss had the filled spinal epidural cavity, cultured out as Strep bacteria.    Remained hospitalized until April 2nd. Sent home for 1 night then returned to hospital via ambulence the next day April 3rd with 103 degree fever.  Discharged April 8th. Readmitted to hospital for 3rd time on April 17 where I remain today with Kidney and liver function problems likely reactions to meds.  Continue to have excruciating low back back which is why continues to be hospitalized at the time of this report.

Had a 101.5 degree temperature all night which went down to 100 in the morning and back up to 101.2 later on the 14th.  I had nausea and extreme pain all over my body and restlessness.  it got a little better the next day but still feels like I have the flu. I had covid back in march of 2020 and was tested for the antibodies at the end of August.  There is a horrific dearth of research on people who have had covid and whether they should get the vaccines. It is disgraceful, and the next time I will listen to my gut which told me NOT to get vaccinated!

                                                One day after the vaccine I had extreme muscle and join pain all over body, general malaise, fever.  This lasted for about 3 days.  About 10 days post vaccine, the symptoms returned with a ferocious energy.  The pain in my muscles and joints is so severe that I can&#39;t roll over in bed, have difficulty walking, and getting on and off the toilet. It interrupts my sleep so that I play musical bed-chair-couch throughout the night.  Needless to say, it exacerbates the level of pain and fatigue I&#39;m already experiencing.  It is life debilitating as I cannot participate in my usual daily activities of walking, hiking, gardening, biking, etc.  As a result of joint and muscle stiffness, I am also now experiencing headaches. These extreme conditions have persisted from March 23- April 9...and I don&#39;t see relief in the future.

                                                On Thursday, March 18, I had some slight dizziness during the day. After going to bed that night I woke up and the night light in the smoke alarm on the ceiling appeared to be spinning. I sat, then stood, grabbling walls for support and attempted to reach my recliner. At that point I was severely dizzy, completely lost any sense of balance and collapsed into the chair. I could not stand or walk. After 20 minutes, I asked my wife to call an ambulance. I did not think she would be able to get me into our car. The paramedics ran an EKG and tested me for a stroke. Both were normal. I was transported to the ER. The doctor gave me Meclizine. Had a CT scan of my brain, and blood work. All results normal. Dizziness resolved. They tested my balance and then released me at 3:30 a.m. on March 19. I was tired that day, but did not need further medication. During that night, as I turned over in bed, the vertigo returned. I took a Meclizine and went to the recliner for the remainder of the night. I am feeling somewhat fuzzy today, March 20. Not sure how long this will continue, or if it is related to my Covid vaccination. However, I am reporting it in the event that others may be experiencing this problem as well.

                                                13th of April. I had a blood clot in my hand. My index finger on  my left hand was numb and black and blue all around the knuckle area and into my hand area. I went to my primary care - I went to the acute center there. She said the hand was cold and could see the black and blue. They put me on Plavix for 30 days and I haven&#39;t had any reoccurrence of that. I think it was the 21st, I couldn&#39;t sleep all night, I had a kidney stone - the pain was so bad I got nauseous - around my back and side and in my front. I didn&#39;t have a fever. I went to the doctor office and they checked urine - and said there was blood in the urine. I was prescribed - Tamsulosin HCL. They thought I had passed most of it by the time I got there.

During the day, while ambulatory, vertical or sitting, my breathing is normal.  As soon as, immediately, when I get into bed for sleep, my breathing is immediately restricted so I cannot maintain lying down.  I have to sit up.  I can&#39;t sleep.  I get exhausted by 3-4-5 a.m. and finally am so distressed I sleep in a sitting up position or catch a snippet of sleep up to an hour or so.  Often wake up with panic attack of suffocating, sit up, jump out of bed, get vertical.
