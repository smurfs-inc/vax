                                                On March 11th at around 10pm I experienced severe shaking, fever, headache and delirium. The next day I improved but had a fever on and off of 99.1. I felt like I was stable, but felt dizziness increasing, and was lethargic through the weekend.   Then on Monday the 15th, I had a noticeable cramp in my right abdomen. At around 8pm CST I began feeling like I needed to burp and that I had GI problems.   The problems increased that night at around 10pm I had pain where the cramp started. Two hours later I started throwing up because of the pain and feeling of too much air inside of me. I could not stop vomiting after 2 hours so went to the Hospital ED at around 2:30 AM Tuesday the 16th.   I was admitted after a CT scan showed and white cell counts confirmed and infection and drastically enlarged appendix. I was diagnosed with an appendicitis and they immediately scheduled me for surgery.

Very severe just after injection. 3 days post vaccine and still feeling dizziness and headache with mild fatigue. Symptoms are similar to a hang over. The symptoms are slightly better than the day of vaccination but still exsist. Symptoms do seem to come and go and are not constant. Little relief is given by tylenol.

                                                Approximately 9 hours after injection, and in mid sleep, intense body heat and severe chills woke up me up every hour for 5 hours(midnight to 5am). My body felt incredibly hot but I did sweat at all. If I would move the bed covers and any part of my skin below my neck felt the air I would get chills the would shake my entire body for a few seconds.  Later that morning; body aches all over, a fever reaching 101.3, fatigue. Over the counter medicines, napping, and a shower helped reduce symptoms.  All was gone by the next morning.

                                                I started to feel really tired around 7:30pm and got a head ache so I went to bed early. I couldn&#39;t sleep well because I got the chills and a fever. I went to use the bathroom around 3am. All of a sudden I got really nauseous, the room spun, everything went black and I fainted in the middle of my bathroom. My wife woke up and helped me back to bed. The next day I was very weak and tired. The chills and fever faded the next afternoon.

                                                Heart racing the next day after vaccination. I went for a walk in the park and i noticed my hear rate jumped up to 165bpm on my fitbit for a period of time even though i just began walking. I wasnt running or anything. I was foggy and very jittery. I also experienced the same symptoms today, 4.12.21 while also heading for a short walk. Im an athlete and in great shape and ive never had my heart jump to 165bpm just walking. That would happen normally after a sprint or long run, but not just walking.

                                                I had the worst headache of my life on 3/22 but assumed it was a migraine and treated it as such.  On 3/23 while playing hockey, nearly immediately after starting, the headache returned even stronger than on 3/22 and forced me to stop playing as I could not concentrate or focus.  The headache lasted for several days.  The following morning I went to my standard physician who immediately sent me to the ER because he was concerned about a potential aneurysm.  No cause was ever determined as the tests were inconclusive but it was suspected to potentially be a pinched nerve.  However, I never had any pain in my neck or elsewhere besides the headache.

                                                Unusual exhaustion within an hour of the vaccine.  Had to go to bed and slept into the evening developing a fever of 103, severe thirst and chills. The fever lasted until 10:00 a.m. the following day, but weakness, thirst, chills and body aches continued for 3 more days intermittently. I would feel like I could finally exercise and then be too weak and tired to go back to routine. My appetite declined for 4 to 5 days as food didn&#39;t taste appealing. On Thursday, April 8, I announced to my mom in the morning that I finally felt like I was back at almost 100% and later in the afternoon felt nauseous, incredible pain in my chest and had dry heaves. I finally vomited some and was once again overcome by a fever of 101 and all I could do was sleep from severe exhaustion. I am against medication, but finally agreed to taking ibuprofen and tums. After sleeping into the next day around noon, I finally was able to eat some breakfast but the pain in my chest continued and I could rid it for another day. I intermittently had to sleep and gave up my exercise routine until my body has had time to recuperate. I have not fully recovered, but my appetite is picking up. I still require more sleep than normal.

                                                Got injected, didn?t hurt much. Was told to wait 15 minutes in case of reaction. They walked away and left me sitting in a chair in a public space with everyone else who was waiting. I texted my wife to check in, when I started tearing up and crying for no real reason, then started feeling nauseous so I closed my eyes.   Suddenly I felt like I had been given a shot of adrenaline out of nowhere so I?m just trying to figure out if it?s nerves or a physiological response to something. I?m trying to control my breathing but having a hard time breathing.   Then the fever hit. The most intense flash of heat. I was hyperventilating. I couldn?t open my eyes or move or make a sound, I could just sit there struggling to breathe. My phone was in my hand and I couldn?t lift it. I just simply didn?t have the strength or energy to move.   At some point I legit thought I was about to die. I managed to angle my wrist so I could check my heart rate with my watch. It was 47bpm.   I was fading away but I made myself get control of my breathing and forced myself to take long deep slow breaths. It hurt, and I felt like passing out, but I kept doing it.   Fever turned into chills and then I soaked through my jeans and T-shirt in under a minute. I was finally thinking clearly and breathing and getting oxygen. Everyone else near me was fine.   Nobody checked on me the entire time including the 3 people who sat there and watched me suffer through this.  I told the pharmacist about my reaction and asked if it was normal and didn?t receive any indication that I should be concerned, so I went home since I felt better.   It wasn?t until my friend pointed out that this sounds like anaphylaxis that I thought I should report it. So here I am. Hopefully I?ll be okay.

About five minutes in, another patient who received the vaccine together with patient told us the patient had fainted. Patient was slumped over to the side when I came to check on patient. I called the patient a few times and patient started to come to. I asked the patient how he was feeling and if he had any difficulty breathing to assess for anaphylactic shock. Patient was breathing normal, but was sweating and a bit confused. Patient reported feeling dizzy. I explained to patient that he fainted for a few minutes and instructed to sit as I did not feel comfortable having patient lay down in the state he was in. Patient was given water and a fan to help cool him down and legs elevated (patient reported feeling much better with the fan blowing on him). Patient sat at the pharmacy for over 30 minutes before heading to the bathroom. At this point, patient were no longer dizzy and I instructed him to get up slowly and assessed that patient was no longer dizzy before letting him go to the bathroom.

I woke up again in a few hours with worse chills, minor headache, and minor joint pain. I took over the counter medication, felt a little better and went back to sleep after a few hours. I woke up around 4am to use the bathroom and still had the worse chills, sweats, minor headache and was very dizzy. I decided to lay down on a rug rather than try to make it back to my bed and laid awake for a few hours again I woke up again in a few hours a little better and repeated everything until Sunday night when all my symptoms were very mild. I eat and drank water regularly and took over the counter acetaminophen a few times.

Monday morning at approximately 0230 i woke up to what i can only describe as lightning pains in my legs.  It was a very intense pain shooting from my upper thighs to my knees and slightly bending around to the top of my calves on the outside of the leg.  Monday all day i did not feel well.  Had a dull pain in center of chest, and my left arm from the shoulder blade to the elbow had what i can only describe as a slight warm sensation.  I was also very &#34;foggy&#34; and light headed.  On Tuesday the pain in my chest worsened.  My left arm kept going numb (and still does today 04.21.2021), my jaw hurt, i was light headed and again very foggy.  On Wednesday it was the same thing and I called the VA and they told me to come to the ER for evaluation.

I have been checking in with that website (V-safe App)  you gave me no one has contacted me. Monday (5/3/21) I missed work due to me not feeling good and still today (5/5/21) I&#39;m at work but feel like I could fall asleep, no energy, nausea still, and like I haven&#39;t slept in weeks even though I get good sleep. My breathing has gotten to the point that it hurts to take a deep breath. I believe this is all due to the shot but didn&#39;t know what you thought.&#34;

By day 13 I started to get intermittent headaches that are very sharp. I am still getting them after three weeks. I have tried muscle relaxants and anti-anxiety medicine but they did not help. At night I am able to sleep but, in the morning, when I get up, I get sharp pains that are like ice picks and last for 3-5 seconds. Some of the headaches are more electric and as the day goes on it gets worse. I have tried taking Magnesium and Vitamin B-Complex and the headaches have changed to where they are starting in the afternoon instead of the morning. The headaches are a seven on a scale of 1-10. Sometimes the headaches come with a low grade fever.

This happened both the first and second night.  During the day I was taking Tylenol every 6 hours for aches and pain.  Mainly my neck and back have been what hurts, although my knees, elbows, hips, etc. also were achy.  The third and fourth days I still continued to have chills, no fever throughout as far as I am aware (took my temp 2-3 times).  The fourth day I was very faint and somewhat unbalanced, felt shaky and light headed and I ended up having an anxiety attack.  I mention the last symptom as I have never had an episode like this previously in my life.  Today is day 5, still feel tired, slightly nauseous, neck and back pain, headache, difficulty focusing.

Following this, symptoms similar to being on a hallucinogenic gradually manifested over the next several hours, including euphoria, a persistent urge to grind teeth, and some mild-to-moderate visual and physical effects.  Following the date of the injection, the primary symptom has been a bruise/cramp hybrid pain in the upper arm of the injection site that is gradually receding (but still ongoing), along with random light bouts of nausea and headaches, random light pains throughout my injection arm, and occurrences of coldness in my injection arm (lasts about an hour)

Shortly after these symptoms I begin to have uncontrollable chills followed by a fever and Nausea. The whole time starting around 8pm I had pretty bad muscle aches as well. I took a warm shower and bundled up the whole night because I had a fever, aches, chills, and nausea. It was impossible to sleep because of this and sometimes my heart was beating fast as well. The next morning I had a headache that would not go away until I took Tylenol. The whole next day I felt exhausted as well and very weak. I began to feel better on day 3 but still feel somewhat foggy from the shot. I would not recommend this vaccine to anyone and would never get it again and hopefully the foggy sensation goes away.

                                                First 2 days after vaccine I had the expected slight sore arm, some minor headache, some muscle aches. Nothing major that kept me from working or sleeping. Some time after, maybe 3rd or 4th day, I noticed a shortness of breath. This I did not expect since it&#39;s not a listed side effect for the vaccine but it is one for Covid. I notice it everyday while sitting/working. It does not keep me from being active (running/yard work) but I notice I&#39;m not 100% healthy feeling. It feels like  the shortness of breath is closer to the top of the chest/throat area if that makes any sense. If I breathe deeply it feels like I may want to cough although I don&#39;t usually cough from doing so. It&#39;s mostly just a constant feeling of a very slight shortness of breath.

Since that time, I had relatively mild symptoms 4/11 - 4/13. Mostly fatigue.  On 4/14, I had a sudden increase in heart rate, dizziness, tingling sensation in all arms and legs and weakness in my limbs/grip. This prompted me to visit the ER. They ran numerous blood tests amd scans on me but found no abnormalities. Various unusual symptoms have continued to persist since 4/14.  For brief moments I feel fine.  At other times I have experience fatigue, diziness/vertigo, rapid heart rate, pins and needles feeling in my left hand and left leg.  Left leg numbness/tightness and heaviness. The fingers on my left hand sometimes move involuntarily.  And my anxiety has also gone up during this time. Tonight it has migratee to my left foot, where I have numbness in several of my toes.  I&#39;m looking for advice. Should I be concerned? Should these symptoms still be occurring 11 days after receiving my shot?  It has been very distressing and there seem to be very few people who have knowledge on this subject.  My care providers keep saying to self monitor and contact them if symptoms worsen. The problem is symptoms don&#39;t necessarily worsen, they just migrate from one area of my body to another.  The numbness comes and goes in maybe 1-2 hour intervals.

I was unable to eat  until the breathing issues subsided late afternoon Sunday since I felt as though I was choking when I  attempted to eat. The fatigue and body pain was pronounced enough for me to have to call off work  Monday, but they gradually diminished. I am submitting this on 3/11, and I am still experiencing some  body aches though the constant feeling of exhaustion is no longer present.

Within about 5-10 minutes his girlfriend comes to the pharmacy window and tells me he&#39;s feeling bad.  By the time I get to his chair he is very lethargic and slumped over.  I sit him up in the chair and his head rolls back and his eyes have rolled back in his head.   I place him on the floor and instructed my staff to call 911.   The patient presented with sweats and was unresponsive for about 10-20 seconds.   When he came to he asked how he got on the floor.   The patient never had any trouble breathing  heart rate was steady the entire time.   When EMS arrived they checked him out and was fine.  He refused transport to the hospital.  He walked out of the store after about 30 minutes from the point of his passing out.

                                                I felt fine all day and went to bed at 9:30pm. I woke up to my body shaking uncontrollably and I was freezing at 10:30pm. My wife felt my skin and she said I was burning up. Unfortunately our thermometer wasn&#39;t working so I don&#39;t know my temperature, but I have never in my life shaken so badly with a fever. I couldn&#39;t control myself and I was shaking so hard that my muscles were sore from it, but I still couldn&#39;t stop. I then began vomiting every 45 minutes or so. This happened for nearly 4 hours until 2:18am. Then very suddenly everything just stopped. No more feeling cold (actually I then felt very warm and couldn&#39;t cool off. I was sweating quite a bit). No more shaking. No more vomiting. I did get a wicked headache, but I figured it was due to dehydration and took two Advil. The Advil didn&#39;t do anything and I was awake until 5:59am because my head hurt too badly to sleep. Finally I slept for about 4.5 hours. Then I just felt worn out for most of the day on the 10th, and couldn&#39;t shake the headache. Then on the evening if the 10th, I started getting a sore throat and a slightly runny nose. I went to bed that way. When I woke up on the 11th (today) I still had the sore throat and slight runny nose. The headache was gone, but I felt tightness in my chest. As I went throughout the day, I&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;m short of breath with doing most things. I have two young children, so even taking care of them I feel like at times I&#39;m struggling for breath. I&#39;m not in bad shape and am a runner, so my cardio isn&#39;t bad. So I was surprised by this.

                                                I had difficulty to think all friday afternoon(2 days after injection). After going to bed around 9:30 PM and therefore lying down  I suddenly started to cough. It last for about 10 minutes, I could not stop. I also started to sweat. At this time I believed I got COVID-19 at the vaccination site and moved to another room to avoid to expose furthermore my wife. I did not cough anymore since then. Today after reading the news and symptoms of blood clot in the lung, I prefer to report this incident.

Then about 5:30pm I got super uncomfortable and then my skin got hypersensitive.   To the point I couldn&#39;t even touch it.  Then I felt like I had a fever but when I checked I did not.  Went to bed at 8pm still with the hypersensitive skin.  Could not get comfortable to sleep but when i eventually fell asleep I slept for 10 hours.  Thats about 5 more than I normally do.  The next day the hypersensitive skin was gone just felt a little wore out.

                                                Patient reported to medical clinic 24 hours after COVID 19 injection (03/19/2021) with symptoms of visual hallucinations, myalgia, rigors, headache, nausea, vomiting and dehydration.  At the time of arrival to the medical clinic, he had refractory nausea and vomiting after receiving Zofran earlier in the day at another clinical site. Medical treatment consisted of IV Fluid bolus with maintenance fluids, IV Phenergan for the nausea and vomiting, and IV Ketorolac for headache pain. His symptoms resolved and he started to feel better so a clinical decision was made to discharge him home in the care of a close friend. He planned to follow-up the next day.   The patient returned to  medical Clinic on 03/22/2021 with no specific symptoms. Previous symptoms from initial encounter resolved according to medical chart. Patient returned on 03/28/2021 with right upper arm DVT proven on U/S. He was seen at Primary Care Clinic beforehand where diagnosis of DVT was made. He was then started on anticoagulation therapy by MD in clinic after specialist phone consult, and will be closely followed. He was sent to Evacuation  to home station due to the complexity of the condition, medications, etc.

                                                At injection muscle spasmed, nurse stated never seen that before.  Within 1-2 hours had runny nose and felt stuffed up, thought it could be allergies or something and didn?t really attribute to vaccine.  4-5 hours  after injection felt something across the top of my brain ... felt as though something had been stuck in a blood vessel and became unstuck allowing blood to shoot through.  Was certainly freaked out by this, but was at an event and head of the ER department of the local hospital was also attending - so figured I had quicker access to medical care there if needed, than at home.   30-60 minutes later congestion completely cleared up.  9-12 hours after vaccination had extreme chills.  Day after vaccination had pain below the injection site... injection was 2? above pain.  Also neck pain. Day 2-8 since vaccination, on/off muscle pain or injection site pain. Today, day 9, have muscle pain in wrist of injection arm.

                                                For about 4 days after the vaccine I had chills, vertigo, fatigue, loss of appetite, hot flashes, and general malaise.   Then, after the first week of having the vaccine, I began to have these symptoms about once a week. Last week, it was on 5/6 when I gradually become colder regardless of layers and my stomach was repelling the idea of food (no vomiting or actual nausea). I went to bed and I was better by morning.   Yesterday (5/12), I had the same thing. Chills and the inability to stay warm, loss of appetite, and a sort of sleepy vertigo.

                                                About five hours after I received the vaccine I began to run a fever that averaged 102 degrees fahrenheit. At that time I also developed chills and extreme fatigue. These symptoms persisted until I fell asleep at 10:00 PM 3/13/21.  I was awakened at 1:00 AM with severe muscle spasms in my left bicep and a fever of 102.5 I started taking tylenol to begin reducing the fever. I also lost my appetite around that time. Things were pretty much the same all day 3/14/21. I went to sleep at 10:00 PM I got up every four hours to take tylenol. I woke up at 7:00 AM 3/15/21 to prepare for work my bed sheets and shirt were soaked with sweat but my fever was gone. I ate breakfast and drank a cup of coffee. When I got to work I begin having stomach problems.  When I started working I noticed that I was having a lot of trouble concentrating. I decided to leave early to go home and rest. Things have improved since then but I do have a headache that won&#39;t go away.

Then 12 hours into the shot I started getting chilly and immediately statrted shaking for 20 minutes, no warning, head to toe, more than just the average chills.  So I took two tylenol and hoped in bed with a few blankets.  The next day I felt like crap, but ok

Within a half an hour I had a 102.5 fever. After 2 hours the chills had dissipated but my fever was at 103.5. I took acetaminophen and slept fitfully all night. The next morning at 6:00 my fever was still 102 and I felt weak. By mid morning the fever was finally gone and I was exhausted and mildly nauseous for the rest of the day.

                                                Pt. received the vaccine at approximately 2:44pm.  Before I could hand him his card, his hands began trembling and he looked pale.  I asked how he was feeling.  He reported feeling shaky, dizzy, and very hot.  I asked him if he was having any difficulty breathing, had tightness in his throat/airways, or even felt a tingle.  He said no.  Noting the time, I asked if he had eaten lunch.  I asked if he has ever felt this way before.  He said he had when he gets a &#34;hypoglycemic attack.&#34;  While not diabetic nor on any medications, he said he will occasionally get very low blood sugar.  He said he had not eaten since early that morning.  Another employee brought some juice I requested.  I again asked him about symptoms related to anaphylaxis, to which was not an indication of an anaphylactic reaction.  I gave him the juice to sip.  I asked him again about symptoms.  Because he was still dizzy, I took his blood pressure/heart rate.  His BP was 160/119 and heart rate 96bpm.  His color became more gray over the next several minutes.  He was still too dizzy to stand, felt hot, shaky, and now nauseous.  He handed over the juice and was given a receptacle if he vomited.  We suspected a vasovagal response, but was still symptomatic after 10 minutes. Meanwhile, the other pharmacist tried to call his doctor&#39;s office.  We learned his doctor had moved away and he had not yet come in nor selected a new provider.   We asked him if he felt he needed to be seen by a doctor.  He said he did and agreed to us calling an ambulance.   The ambulance arrived around 3:10.  The EMTs took his BP.  It had come down, but he could not stand up without his knees buckling.  The EMTs got him on the stretcher and took him to the hospital.

Took 2 Advil which did not seem to help much. Could not sleep all night and held cold pack on head to try to help headache. At 4:00 am was due to take 2 more Advil, and that finally seemed to help so he finally stopped having chills and could sleep. Woke up in the morning tired, but feeling better, symptoms pretty much gone.

The patient did not report feeling any adverse symptoms at the checkout station after his 15 minute observation period and before leaving the vaccination clinic.    After patient returned home, his partner reports considerable swelling on his left arm, continued hallucinations and trying to dismiss her concerns. Subsequently, that same day, partner reports the patient had a severe migrane and began to lose feeling on his left arm and leg, at which point the patient also lost consciousness.  Also at this point, the partner calls 911.   After arrival of emergency personnel, the patient regains consciousness, but does not remember name and complains of continued pain on his arm. He is transported to hospital where he spends 3 nights and receives treatment and care for stroke symptoms.    Patient reports that he does not remember much of anything 1.5 days after vaccination.   After returning home from hospital, patient complains of memory lapses and begins seeing neurologist for minor seizures during his sleep.   Wife reports that patient now lashes out and easily loses temper due to the fact that his memory is foggy.

                                                Before receiving the vaccination the patient mentioned he had a fear of needles.  Patient was asked if he ever fainted after getting a vaccination or injection and patient reported no.   The vaccine was administered to the patient and patient appeared to be fine for the next few minutes after getting vaccinated.  Patient was told he could take a seat in the waiting area and wait until his 15-minutes were up and he could go.  Patient was seated in the waiting area for about a minute but then got up to walk down one of the isles. When walking down the isle patient fainted and collapsed. This occurred approximately 10 minutes or so after he received the vaccine.  Patient was helped to a chair and once seated appeared to shake/convulse (almost like a seizure) for approximately 5-10 seconds before snapping out of it and regaining consciousness.  Afterwards he was alert and talking but didn&#39;t remember fainting.  911 was called and he was checked out by paramedics. After observing him for 15 minutes or so and determining his heartrate and blood pressure were normal and he appeared to be ok, the paramedics told him they can take him to the hospital to be evaluated further, or he was free to leave on his own without going to the hospital.  The patient said he felt fine and declined being taken to the hospital. After another 10-15 minutes the patient left under his own power. Patient mentioned he would possibly be calling his physician and alerting them to the episode.

I felt extreme fatigue for the next 48 hours.  I felt my heart racing off and on for 24 hours,  I felt a loss of strength in both arms and legs for the next 48 hours.  Monday Night I woke up sweating as I had a fever.  The fever persisted off and on for about 24 hours. I was irritable (probably due to not feeling well) for about 48 hours.  My wife had to drive me home.

My body was cold. I had a pretty severe headache as well.  My body ached all over. Muscle and joint pain. I took Tylenol, but it didn&#39;t seem to do much. I spent all day Saturday in bed or on the couch. I ran a fever of 100.9 to 101.6 all day Saturday. My body ached making it hard to go up or down stairs. I was weak feeling and I was exhausted just going to refrigerator to get juice or water. Not much of an appetite all day. Also, arm was sore and bruised at the shot location. That was the least of my issues. Today is Sunday and I am feeling better now. I feel like the worst is absolutely behind me, but I felt so terrible yesterday, I thought I should report my issues.

                                                3AM woke up with high fever, headache, muscle ache from shoulders up. Treated with Tylenol to reduce fever, symptoms continued through the day. 2PM discovered large patch of hives on back from right shoulder to waist approximately 4 inches wide at the top and narrowing to 1 inch wide at the bottom. Treated with my go-to allergic reaction kit: Xyzal, Benadryl, Prednisone, and Pepcid. Hives started fading after 1 hour and were mostly gone within 3 hours, followed by 12 hours of sleep.

                                                I could not report March 15 when this occurred because Vaers HHS did not have the Janssen listed as an option to report against at that time. Unusual for me hour long nosebleed resulting in use of a half of box of tissues. It occurred at 3am so doing anything other than homecare didnt seem necessary. After getting this vaccine I felt a brain fog for approx 15 days especially after being awake for about 8 hours, unusual for me as well. The nosebleed was of most concern and with the recent pause I saw on todays news about blood clotting issues. I felt it was important I report my experience on day 8 of vaccine and days 2 thru 15 of vaccine. I would not go back in time and take this vaccine based on my side effects.

                                                Day 1: Saturday morning March 6 at 5:00am I was shaken out of my sleep with a nasty migraine, sour stomach, intense body aches, stuffy nose, fever (102f). Classic flu like symptoms. I was extremely sick all day Saturday (level of sick: 8/10). Day 2: Sunday morning March 7 I awoke again extremely sick, just as sick as Saturday. All same symptoms (level of sick: 7/10). Sunday night I was incredibly miserable, all flu symptoms, I did not sleep Sunday night, up all night and up all day the next day Monday. Day 3: Monday I continued to be sick, all same symptoms, all day long. This time the blood shot eyes &amp; bloody nose came on, fever was steady at 101f (level of sick: 6/10). Day 4: Tuesday woke up still stick, same flu like symptoms. I feel the headache has gotten worse, in fact way worse. Fever steady at 101f all day. Overall I&#39;m not as sick except the headache and fever (level of sick: 6/10).  Day 5: Wednesday I was really hoping I&#39;d make a full recovery but still still sick, fever dropped for a few hours then came back, fever peaks and bounces around at 101f. Headache is absolutely nasty, I feel intense pain in the back of my neck and head, hard to sleep or lay down. (level of sick: 5/10). Day 6: Thursday I feel like I&#39;m just about kick this sickness, feeling way better. I dont have a fever today but I still have an incredibly nasty headache, really intense, my eyes hurt, back of my neck hurts. (level of sick: 3/10). Day 7: Friday, no flu symptoms, finally!! But the headache continues, really bad. It sort of disables my ability to function with the headache. Back of my neck and back of head hurts, inside my brain hurts. Ugh! Day 8: Saturday, no flu, no fever, although still bad headache. I&#39;ve been taking Advil all week to help reduce the headache. It helps, but after about 6 hours later the headache returns. Late in the evening Saturday my head was pounding. Day 9: Sunday headache not that bad, mild headache lingered throughout the day, tolerable. Day 10: Monday no headache!! Today was the first full day of full happiness!! *NOTE*: In July 2020 I got COVID extremely bad, spent 4 days in the ICU, couldnt breathe!! I had a fever of 103 for 6 days straight before calling 911 to come and get me. I was in bad shape, lost 30 lbs, had respiratory breathing issue for about 2 months after hospital stay. Most sick I&#39;ve ever been, total game changer, I will never be the same. To this day I feel my respiratory is at 90%, fatigue still comes around every so often. --- Thank you ---

                                                When injected after about 60 seconds semi severe achy-burning feeling  in my arm that subsided in a few minutes. After 15 minutes slight tingling/numbness on the tip of my tongue and slight tingling in the upper lips of my mouth. I was not worried. I took 1 Benadryl and 2 Ibuprofen (400 ml) at that time for symptoms. I took additional 1 Benadryl and 4  Ibuprofen about 6 hours later as a precaution.  Day 2 after about 36 hours I had slight soreness, and some sweating as I slept the 2nd night. Treated with 4 ibuprofen. Also I woke up with a feeling of uneasiness in the middle of the night on the 2nd night.  Day three, just a general feeling of tiredness. Day 4 and 5 still slight ache in the injection sight if pressure is applied. Other than that I feel normal as of day 5.

                                                I would like to report what happened with all the facts.  One week after I had vaccine, I had very serious nose bleeding in the morning. I said very serious because I felt it cannot stop by itself. I called 911 and went to ER. First time, I use 911 and ER. All previous nose bleeding is very minor and it will stop in a minute. But this time, I just felt the blood just pouring into my mouth. So I was scared and  asked my wife called 911. After 2-3 hours, the bleeding stopped and I back home. To be cautious, I made an appointment with family doctor on next day (24th). But the bleeding happened again in the evening ( cannot remember exactly, but around 9pm). This time I just used the clipper for my nose and it took another 2 hours for the bleeding to stop. I had a very rough night while sitting on bed and had very little sleep. The next morning (24th), the bleeding come back after I used the restroom. The same feeling as the two bleeding before. I rushed to doctor&#39;s office even not my appointment yet. The family doctor said he cannot do anything since he cannot observe the place of blooding and he does not have instrument needed. I was referred to a specialist. And luckily I had the same day appointment. We rushed there and after roughly several hours waiting, I was the specialist and finally he did the treatment. Since then, my nose is ok and no serious bleeding again.  After I saw the side effects of JJ vaccine, I think it is better for me to report you what happened. I strongly suspect that my serious bleeding was caused by the drop of platelet which was side effect of the vaccine. I will have one blood work today. And will let you know results if you are interested. Again, I never had such serious bleeding before and that is the reason for my suspect.  All the best

I have also have and continue to have shortness of breath and chest pains resulting in two panic attacks within the last three days. This has led me to report this and I have doctor visit scheduled for 4/22. I also reported today based on internet search of reactions.

                                                I received the shot at 1:11 pm. I felt sorta drunk and not safe to drive by 3 pm. Sorta woozy. By 7 I was  home and fell asleep and did not wake up until 4 pm the next day.   I was sleepy and felt terrible nausea and was sweaty three nights in a row.  By the 2nd night  I had a headache that was unbelievable.  I eventually took Tylenol 48 hrs after the shot and it barely helped the headache. I never ever get sick never have headaches. It was bad. I was also super super irritable and I am generally a happy person. I was so bothered by everyone I was sorta angry at them it was weird. By Sunday night my headache was even worse so bad in my neck on my left side that I had the shot, I could barely move my head. I took Tylenol recommended dose. I finally fell asleep on Sunday night 3 days later midnight sweaty again.   Monday morning I woke up and I never felt better. On top of the world amazing.  I felt not  just good but extra good. Ready to go for it all.  It was a very strange experience for over three days. I typically get the flu shot, I stay healthy and never had an experience like this, I don?t get sick luckily. Any I wanted to share this because it was so strange and no one warned me really. .  I have felt great since and am thankful I had the shot.

I did not take any over the counter Medicine after the shot at all  in fear of affecting the vaccine.

Now Its been a month and I struggle to dress myself. My shoulder hurts really bad. On a scale from 1-10 its usually a 3-4 during the day and sometimes a 9 at night. The only thing that helps is Aleve and my family doctor told me I can&#39;t take Aleve anymore because I&#39;m on blood thinners. She said take Tylenol. I followed her advice and It doesn&#39;t work. She said if it keeps hurting, to come back in 2 weeks.

                                                Starting approx 7 hours after injection I started to feel run down.  I then played tennis for about 45 minutes.  I got home around 8:30 and started to experience extreme chills, fever of 100.4, joint aches in feet, hands, neck, wrists, shoulders, hips.  Headache. I did not take any additional medication - toughed it out.  This morning is approx 22 hours after vaccine.  I could not sleep more than an hour or so, I was very chilled and achy.  I am currently feeling a little better but still have aches in my back and wrists and ankles, have a headache

                                                I received the Johnson and Johnson Covid 19 vaccine on 4/6/21 and the dose code is 041AZ1A. I received it at the Community Center.  I&#39;m writing because beginning with the evening after I received the Johnson and Johnson Covid 19 vaccine I&#39;ve been having abdominal / stomach cramps and stomach pain. Sometimes it is on the top of the abdomen / stomach, other times it&#39;s at the bottom. Sometimes it hurts to the point of waking me up in the middle of the night. This morning it started moving into my chest.  Do you know if this pain will subside shortly or what is known about this potential side effect? Is there anything I can do to mitigate the issue?  I&#39;m contacting my Dr for a visit.

                                                2 hours after vaccination I noticed left arm started hurting . Went to bed at my usual time and woke up at 2:00 am with the chills I could not get warm late that night around 5:00 am I started having joint pain and fatigue with a headache and hot skin. I had taken my temperature and it was 100.7. I tried to wait out symptoms but I seem to bee get worse throughout the morning. Around 10:00 am I was in terrible pain and my body hurt all over. I once again took my temperature and it had gone up to 101.9. I had to call of work because I was so ?out of it?.  I started taking Tylenol ever 4 hrs for my fever and I was trying to hydrate.  My temperature slowly went down but still had body pain. I then started thank ibuprofen to help. Later that night around 9:00 pm my temperature was 99. The next day I called off work for fatigue and body pain. Today my temperature is normal and I?m starting to feel like my self again

Very restless, tossing and turning, not tired - very awake (which is unusual).  Next morning, arose at 5am with moderate chills, moderate all over body aches, and moderate headache - very symptomatic of the regular flu.   Felt bad enough to call out of work.  As of this moment, roughly 33 hours later, it seems to be subsiding, but unsure if that&#39;s just the Advil. * Note:  Vaccine is &#34;Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Lot # 1805031 administered.

                                                At 10 pm I had the chills and went to bed earlier than I normally do. Around 2 am, I was experiencing an irregular and racing heartbeat. My resting heartbeat is normally around 68 to 70. When monitoring my heartbeat through my Watch, I experience a heart rate of 100 to 120 beats per minute and I could feel it was irregular too. I had a very restless night, elected not to go to the ER and the symptoms were gone by about noon, although I did have a terrible headache all morning long.

I was also feeling tired and unsteady. 12 days after the shot I became very sick for 10 days with severe diarrhea, no energy,  stomach pains, weak, shaking, no more motivation.  I saw a doctor and was given antibiotics to stop the diarrhea. Now 1 month after I have no diarrhea but still get nausea and shakes . I feel very anxious and will see a therapist and prescribe medication for my anxiety that I have due to the vaccine reaction.  I took the vaccine so I can travel abroad much easier but now afraid to travel because of my symptoms.  I will get blood tested tomorrow to see if all is ok.  This vaccine is very dangerous as it has affected my DNA.

                                                Patient initially presented with meningitis-like syndrome with altered mentation, fever, headache, neck stiffness and found to have multifocal brain (predominantly brainstem lesions).  He was initially started on empiric meningitis coverage (ceftriaxone, vanc, ampicillin, acyclovir) which was stopped when CSF tests/cultures returned negative and he improved. Around 10 days later he then developed Guillain-Barre syndrome with ascending weakness of legs and inflammation of cauda equina nerve roots and inflammatory involvement of spinal cord as well causing weakness, numbness, autonomic dysfunction (cardiac arrhythmias) and urinary retention. He was treated with 5 day course of IVIG and improved enough to go to acute rehab. Diagnosis was ultimately concluded as atypical Bickerstaff&#39;s encephalitis or idiopathic inflammation of the brain, spinal cord and nerve roots without no other causative event identified other than recent vaccination

We quickly checked his temperature however it was within normal range. We applied cold packs to his wrists, forehead, and face for about 12 minutes. I checked for normal capillary refill and asked him questions to assess his mental status. About 20 minutes after starting the treatment, patient started improving. He returned almost back to normal in about 30 minutes.

After bible study at night, almost all bro &amp; sis said that was symptom of stroke, and suggested us to see emergency doctor.  On 11pm, we were at emergency room.  4/3/21, Sat. I was admitted 1-2 am into impatience room. CT diagnosed a big gray area in between speech are and spine. 4/3/21, Sat afternoon. MRI and MRA had been tested.  Cardiologist said he could not rule out the last option, which was due to slow heart beat 50-60. But I have slow heart beat since I remembered things from 4-5 year-old. He suggested wearing a heart monitoring device for a 4 weeks after discharged.  4/4/21, Sun noon.  Doctor admitted to discharge. They could not find cause, and would like to follow up within 1 to 2 weeks after discharging.  4/13/21, Tue night, I started wiring body monitoring device.

Pushed fluids to make sure I was not dehydrated. Had some coffee to make sure it wasn&#39;t caffeine withdrawal. Headache became less severe over time. By the third day it was pretty much gone.  Possibly unrelated, starting 04/11/2021 through 04/15/2021 I had severe insomnia. I could not sleep longer than 1-2 hours. Very active mentally while trying to fall asleep. My brain was constantly churning over thoughts, emotions, work, not work, etc. I struggled to just calm my head and go to sleep.  The night of 04/15/2021 I slept 3.5 hours. I was very physically active on 04/16/2021 and slept 10 hours that night (last night). Active today, but back to having trouble going to sleep.

Went to urgent Care on 4/8 where treated for severe dehydration and stomach aligment.  From 4/9 - 4/14 continued to suffer from same symptoms and then began to have heart taching, feeling as if there was a bubble in my chest.  Went back to Urgent Care on 4/14 and was again treated for dehydration.  Outcome is that no one knows why I have been feeling this way except for that it is a direct result of receiving the vaccine.

Medical team took HR and BP and was normal Took about 20 minutes and light headedness went away  Later that night at around 12:30 am, felt very cold and shivering with severe headache Did not take temperature Had a hard time going back to sleep Got up around 1:00 am to take 800 mg of OTC Advil When walking back up stairs had severe muscle pain in arms and legs Was fine after that Seemed to get better by 2 am No issues next day  About 7-10 days later developed severe frontal headaches/sinus pressure No other symptoms Used Neti Pot with saline solution and did nothing Took OTC allergy meds and Advil and did nothing  Say my primary care Dr and he prescribed Flonase, Singular and Allegra &#43; continue Neti Pot and Advil as needed Not much improvement on this regime after 3-5 days of use  About a week later developed severe pain in bottom right jaw Took OTC Advil and again no improvement Went to Dentist and said not tooth related but probably TMJD Recommend dental appliance to help with grinding  About a few days later after this jaw pain developed, developed sharp stabbing pain in bottom of left knee cap. No recollection of any insult that would cause this  All three of these pain sites were perfectly fine prior to getting J&amp;J vaccine.  No history of pain or injury to these areas prior  All of these incidents to me seem to be inflammatory/immune in nature and could be related to J&amp;J vaccine based upon how I reacted to injection.  Curious if others are seeing the same thing and if so what should be done or how long should this last?

                                                Patient was scheduled for an appointment for a Johnson &amp;Johnson  covid-19 vaccine through a drive thru Thursday April 8, 2021 @12:45pm. We arrived early and he received the vaccine at 12:15pm, waited 30 minutes for reaction and he was feeling fine. Later that same evening, the patient was driving to work on the freeway when he felt a dry throat so he coughed hard, at that cough he felt a massive pain in his head, like his &#34;head was going to explode.&#34; He immediately had tunnel vision closing in on him, so he pulled over and later woke up in our parked car with flashing emergency lights on, parked on the shoulder of the freeway. Disoriented and confused why he was there, he looked at his watch and saw he lost 15 minutes when he had passed out. MY HUSBAND COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED IF HE HAD NOT PULLED HIMSELF OVER WHEN PASSING OUT. Today we reported this to our doctors office and to you!

                                                Lost his vaccine card would not give him a new one.  He got his vaccine, had burning sensation immediately after the needle was pulled out.  About 5-10 minutes later he started sweating, and seemed to have calmed down and felt OK.  He was observed for 30 minutes there and went for observation for another 30  minutes.  He went to another doctors office and at about 15:00 started feeling light headed and weak.  He drove back home, picked up some stuff at a grocery store, and outside the grocery store in 80 degree heat he felt the need to put on a jacket as he had the chills.  he went home, went to bed feeling bad, his shoulder was still burning where he got hte vaccin.e  He had a little bit of site pain, applied topical and the pain went away.  He woke up the next morning feeling really bad, felt like a major flu, his head felt like it was going to explode, but no problem with sinuses, no cough, no sneezing.  His eyes were watering from the pain, and chills on and off.  He had to change his sheets a couple of times due to sweating.  He then developed a fever of 99 degrees at about 18:00 that night, and about 19:00 he went to 102 when he checked it.  After that it went to 103, and about 15 minutes after that it was 104, and then higher at 104.&#43;.  He took some vodka, honey and lemon juice and took an alcohol bath and the fever had not broken yet.  He called the clinic and they told him to call 9-1- 1 and to go to the ER.  He went to the ER at about 10:00, gave him fluids, did a chest x-ray and released him about midnight.  He apparently disoriented and tried to walk off and didn&#39;t remember this.  They took him back to the gate and called his son.  He went home, took another bath and woke up in sweat and was in bed for the entire weekend.  He got up Monday morning, 4/13/21 feeling a little bit better and went to see his doctor, who does not believe he was having any side effects and that the information that is being reported is true.   He is still feeling a little weak and still fatigued and on bedrest.  He was taking Advil besides his regular medicines every 6 hours with 500 mg of Tylenol for the intense pain as every joint in his body ached, and the worst headache he had ever had, as well as the high fevers.  His fever subsided on Saturday morning, and still had some sweats following that.  Did have hot/cold flashes on Saturday and Sunday.   He was given a COVID test in the ER and he was negative, but did not give him any other information regarding his lab work.

Next morning pain, swelling and nausea persisted. Medium intensity body aches and headache began late morning. By mid afternoon body pain increased to the point that I was no longer able to function and needed to lie down.  Took a 4 hour nap. Side effects persisted after waking up.  At time of writing, 28hrs after vaccine, I am still feeling the side effect although less severe. Ibuprofen and Tylenol  do seem to help.

I currently take 5mg Lisinopril daily to manage high blood pressure and maintain a morning average around 118/80.  The morning after the vaccination my blood pressure rose throughout the morning to 158/115.  At noon, I took an additional 2.5mg of Lisinopril (in a addition to the 5mg I took before bedtime the night before). Also, to manage anxiety, I took 0.5mg Alprazolam.  My blood pressure returned to normal by 5pm; and has been normal up to the day of this report.

                                                Evening after getting vaccination I developed fairly loud tinnitus in both ears.  The ringing was loud enough to keep me awake, even though I felt pretty weak and achy from the vaccine.  It subsided after about a week but is still present to some extent.  I&#39;ve noticed it off and on before the vaccination, but never so steady or strong.  About one month after the vaccine I&#39;d say it&#39;s a little worse than before, but not terrible.

He had chroinically low platelet from cirrhosis and was also a clotter as evidenced several year ago with portal vein thrombosis travelling down to his mesenteric veins causing a similar lower GI bleed by clotting his colonic veins. He required several months of anticoagulants with blood thinner at that time. One week prior to his COVID-19 vaccination there ia picture of deceased with evidence of bilateral suborbital bleeding. Patient told family that he felt poorly after injection. The day he was found there was evidence of significant GI bleeding. His corpse is currenly at medical examiner&#39;s office with no plans for autopsy.

                                                Around 7:00 P.M. on March 12, 2021 approximately 9 hours after receiving the Jansen COVD-19 vaccine in my left arm. I developed extreme fatigue, muscle aches, skin hurt to the touch of anything including clothing, headache, and fever 101.5.  I had to go to bed and was very weak.  I took ibuprofen and Tylenol for the discomfort.  I slept 14 hours and was able to get up at 11:00 A.M. on March 13, 2021.  The soreness at the site of the injection is not problematic.  There were other odd symptoms overnight I would awake with strange nerve like sensations tingling and itching that occurred on the bottom of the left foot, upper lip, and neck.  I also had several episodes of restlessness that was so bad that I had to stand for a few minutes before being able to lay down again.  The worst is the skin hurting and headache.  I have also had a few dizzy episodes since getting out of bed this morning.  It passes if I sit down or hold onto something.  None of these symptoms are normal for me and I cannot remember having a reaction to any vaccinations that I have received in the past.  I hope this helps with your study.

About 10 hours later I started feeling sick.  One of the first things I noticed besides a headache was my heart rate jumped up to over 100 beats per minute (it is normally below 84).  I started getting chills and fever.  It was worse than any flu fever I ever had and I could not sleep.  Worst part was my heart rate would not go down, remaining above 100 but below 110-115 beats per minute.  I considered calling 911 but after looking online decided not to as long as it remained below 120 bpm.  I don&#39;t know my maximum temperature - I did not think to take it until after the peak had passed by 20 minutes or so (was 99.4 at that point - normal temperature runs 97.2 (low 96.8, high 98.2)).  Heart rate finally started to drop around 3:30 am.

She said my face was drooping, I couldn&#39;t smile or stand.  She called Ambulance.  Ambulance arrived and decided symptoms of stroke and called for helicopter to take me to medical center.   When I arrived they did CT and I was later told it showed possible areas of no oxygen to brain.  They gave me TPA drug and almost immediately  I could see improvement - my headache cleared.  Throughout the next couple hours I regained movement on right side and all functionality returned except weakness in right arm.  I stayed in ICU for 24 hours as required after receiving TPA and while additional tests were ran then was discharged on Friday, April 16, 2021

I was sent to the ER where they ran multiple tests on me to determine a cause.  No alcohol, no drugs, no bipolar, no infection.  It was determined that the vaccine was the cause of this really awful event.

Around 9:00pm started to feel chills and tired with low grade fever (100 C). Around 1:30am started feeling right side back pain in my kidney area that woke me up. By 2:15am the pain was almost unbearable, and I could no longer lay in bed. At 3:00am I took 2x 500mg Tylenol as I debated whether to call my doctor or go straight to ER. By the 3:45am pain was subsiding and was I able to get back in bed by 4am. Today no pain.

Once the patient &#34;came to&#34; they were coherent but perspiring a bit.  The patient was offered water and a cool damp cloth. The patient was offered EMT services which they declined. The patient was made to wait another 15 minutes in the observation area. The patient did have a spouse with them who would be driving them home. The patient was called later in the day to by the pharmacist to see how the were feeling. The patient stated they were fine and appreciated the follow-up call.

                                                After my J&amp;J vaccine, I experienced left hip and joint pain. I could not lift my left leg up. The next morning after my J&amp;J vaccine, my left leg started hurting more and I could not ambulate. My left hip was hurting so bad I could not sleep at night. I went to the doctor 03-17-2021 to get monitored and he said it could be arthritis. I was prescribed by Dr.  cyclobenzaprine 10mg and naproxen 500mg. I feel that my pain is inside the joint, hip pain region and to this day, I still have sleeping problems due to my pain in my left leg and left hip pain since the J&amp;J vaccine. I will have a  follow up with Dr. in the coming weeks.

On the 6th day after my vaccine, I developed a lump on the right side of my throat which progressively got worse. I also experienced diarrhea which lasted three days. I went to see my PCP, Dr. who ordered a CT scan of my neck. The CT scan demonstrated I had an ulcer in my throat located in my larynx box. MY PCP  doctor then referred me to  an ENT doctor, Dr. The ENT doctor gave me antibiotics and a shot in my arm. My throat kept getting worse and the ENT doctor have me reflux medicine and Prednisone and Bactrum medication. Today I woke up feeling much better although the pain and swelling to my left side of my throat and ear has gone down but I still have a sore throat and ulcer and is being treated with medicine.
