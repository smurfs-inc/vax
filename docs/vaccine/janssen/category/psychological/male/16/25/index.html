The left hand experienced carpal tunnel and arthritis-like symptoms for 6 days longer than all other symptoms. It then went away on its own. To my knowledge, I hadn?t in any way performed stressful or repetitive behaviors leading up to the symptoms; I had been bedridden with the vaccine side-effects and was too exhausted to do much of anything.

He experienced vertigo as well as nausea. He tried to text and it came out as a jumble of misspelled words and letters. He called me, his mother, and he was extremely hard to understand and couldn&#39;t say a complete sentence without using words that made no sense. Him being in college I was 1.5 hours away. We were able to contact a friend of his and she was able to go to his dorm room and they called the campus on call nurse line. After speaking with her she instructed them to call 911 because she thought he could possibly be having a stroke. Patient was transported by ambulance to ER.

Throughout night woke up many times with same symptoms. At 6:00 AM woke up for good with a 102 fever, migraine, soreness, chills, and no energy. At 8:00 AM the fever got up to 103°F. I then took Tylenol and the fever slowly started to subside but the migraine, soreness, and lack of energy stayed. As of Tuesday, two days after the vaccine, symptoms have gone away.

Random bouts of tinnitus in both ears, switching off, never both ears at once. The arm pain and swelling in shot area lasted about two days,  but the nausea, ;over pain, and fatigue continued for the better part of 4 days after the shot. The tinnitus only happened a couple times about 1-3 hours after the vaccination then ceased. I did not get this verified by a doctor, but I suspect my liver pain was related to an inflammation in the liver associated with the vaccine, as in the past, pain around my liver area has been associated with inflammation of my liver during minor flare ups.

                                                Client had a J&amp;J vaccine at 1327. He reported that he was having trouble breathing around 1333. He reported that he felt hot and sweaty and lightheaded. He appeared distressed. We called 911, then we provided a client with a cold pack. His pulse was 47 bpm and his spO2 was 97%. He continued to state that he was lightheaded so we had him lay down on the ground and take deep breaths. EMS arrived the collected his vitals which were WNL. His blood glucose was 71. He was warm and moist to the touch. EMS stayed with the client until 1350 at which point he had sat up and sat in the chair. He said he was definitely not having trouble breathing anymore and was feeling better. Provided client with a juice box and water. Client stayed onsite until 1410 at which point he said he felt comfortable leaving.  Client walked unassisted out of the clinic.

Subsided largely, but chills started and became more heightened after strenuous exercise later in the day. After 3 hours of sleep, awoke the next day with chest pain and difficulty moving. Heart rate (normally 60) spiked to 140 and could not see fit five seconds, had to call ambulance. Ambulance determined much of it was due to anxiety (multiple exams and significant work were due soon), and recommended medical supervision to ensure it did not escalate. Went to urgent care and was supervised until 1 pm, 24 hours after the vaccination, by which time symptoms had subsided

                                                High fever, extreme shaking and chills, nausea. I was pretty much immobile from 11pm-3am (until I was able to fall asleep) on the day of vaccination (3/8/21). This happened immediately after I showered with hot water. The next day  (3/9/21) until around 8pm I had a high fever, chills (not as bad but still pretty bad), headache, nausea, fatigue, and extreme muscle/joint pain particularly in my back and arms. I was unable to work, go to school, or do homework the entire day. After 8pm, I was down to a 100.4 fever and slight chills with mild nausea and fatigue. Today (3/10/21), I have mild muscle pain in my back and near the injection site. I took 400mg of ibuprofen every 6-8 hours from 3:00pm 3/8/21 (day of injection) to present with mild effects on pain and fever levels. I?m an infrequent user of ibuprofen. If I didn?t have someone with me the first night after the vaccination (3/8/21) I would have gone to the hospital.

                                                Immediately had a dull headache. About an hour and a half just didn&#39;t feel well and became very tired where he was dozing off.  About 7:00 pm started to shake.  This continued to get worse with severe jerking along with the uncontrollable shaking.  Had a rapid resting heart rate over 142 and a fever at 102.4.  Was incoherent, mumbling his words and not making any sense. Went to ER at 8:48 pm they did blood work, urine test and started an IV.  They weren&#39;t sure what was going on and first accused of doing drugs then wanted to do a spinal tap. His father stopped that and again told them it was from the covid vaccine. They finally gave him a shot of Ketorolac 30mg and LORazepan 1 mg. They sent him home and told him to take tylenol for his fever. spontaneous shaking kept on until late 3/11, along with a fever.  Friday 3/12 he is feeling better, fever has broke but not quite 100%.

                                                Patient was administered Janssen COVID vaccine. Patient was fine immediately post administration in the IMZ room but witness stated he fell sideways (within a few minutes of receiving the vaccine) out of post-administration observation chair (which is in front of the pharmacy). Technician called code white and patient was immediately met with management and the pharmacy team. Patient was laying on his stomach on the floor, supporting himself upward with both hands/forearms. Patient had blood dripping from forehead and nose. Gauze was applied to laceration on forehead to help with bleeding and once patient was able to roll over on his back, an ice pack was applied to his forehead/nose area. Patient said he felt &#34;pain&#34; after the injection and then he felt light-headed. He remembered blacking out for a few seconds. Patient stated he felt &#34;ok&#34;, then later stated he felt better but just had a bad headache. Patient stated he felt &#34;it starting to hurt&#34; and that it triggered his anxiety. Dad was in the store and arrived a few minutes later; dad said son/patient has a &#34;fear of needles&#34; and &#34;he hasn&#39;t had anything to eat today in quite awhile&#34;. EMS arrived to examine patient and asked him if he needed to go to the ER; dad felt going to the ER was for the best since they had a 3 hour car ride home. Paramedics then transported patient to the ER and said he would likely need a stitch for the cut above his eyebrow.

                                                Patient was waiting in chair about 5 minutes after the vaccine when I heard him say he didn&#39;t feel too good. His skin color was pale and when I went up to see how he was he bent over and vomited. After he vomited he said he felt a lot better. I asked him to remain seated and asked for my tech in the pharmacy to call 911, but he then said no and that he was feeling better. He said he felt clammy just before he vomited. I asked him to stay seated and got him some cold water. He remained in the waiting area another 15 minutes after to make sure no further problems. After 15 minutes he was feeling fine and I reassessed and his color returned to his skin and I noticed some redness around inner portion of both thighs, but he said that was from his eczema and that it was there already.  Allowed him to leave at 1:15pm and told him to seek medical attention right away if he felt any issues regarding trouble breathing. I called him an hour later to check up on him at 1:30pm and he was feeling fine. He thanked me over the phone.

                                                It is now the next day, and I feel significantly better. I have pain at the injection site, some muscle fatigue, a little bit of a depleted appetite, tiredness in my eyes and head (likely due to lack of quality sleep), and a bit of sweating, but my pain has reduced to maybe a 2/10 or 1/10 (i.e., not even uncomfortable). I did end up getting decent sleep between 2 AM and 12 PM with only a few interruptions of family members checking on me. The only notable pain that is worrying me is abnormal soreness in my right wrist that is not the result of overuse, overextension, etc., although I was able to take care of that pain with another 3 Advil pills. I am considering scheduling a doctor&#39;s appointment, as I know the J&amp;J vaccine got recalled today for blood clots. My assumption is that because I am a healthy 20-year-old, my immune system overreacted to the vaccine, but I want to check to make sure that it doesn&#39;t cause any additional health problems.

Shortly after, the patient reported &#34;feeling pale&#34; and was told to remain seated. The patient then fell over from the chair and lost consciousness. We immediately called 911 and went to the patient&#39;s side with epinephrine. However, he recovered within seconds and was able to sit up and drink water.  He reported feeling &#34;pale [...], weird [...]&#34; and said he felt like his &#34;ears are sweating.&#34; He did not want epinephine and remained seated and responsive. When asked, he said he had never received any adverse reactions to any vaccines in the past. A pharmacist then cleaned and disinfected his right temple that was bleeding, which he seemed to have hit when he fell. He later reported feeling chest pain and slight difficulty breathing but did not want epinephrine at that time. Emergency services arrived about 20 minutes after and assessed the patient and removed him in a gurney.

                                                Within a minute of receiving the vaccine, patient slumped back in the chair, head back, eyes open. He was unresponsive and shaking in the chair. After about 20 seconds he came to and leaned forward but wasn&#39;t oriented to time and place. As I was talking to him, trying to assess his breathing, he slumped back in the chair and began shaking much more violently.  I asked the store director to call EMS at that point, I took his mask off at that point to better assess his breathing. After about 15 seconds, he came to again. At that point, I had him lean forward with his elbows on his knees, and he didn&#39;t lose conciousness after that. I took his blood pressure (70/22) and pulse (52, light and hard to find). EMS arrived soon after and at that point patient felt much better. EMS decided not to transport the patient to the ER. They instructed patient to follow up with his provider. Patient left the vaccine area under his own power about half an hour later.

                                                The patient began experiencing nausea and light-headedness around 11:00 P.M. on the 6th of April. Three hours later, he reported lower back pain that steadily increased in severity over the course of several hours. Throughout that same night, severe headaches and impaired kidney capacity (i.e. constant need to urinate about every hour) kept him from sleeping longer than two or three hours. Come morning of the 7th (roughly 8:30 A.M.), he took a single capsule of ibuprofen and performed various lower back stretches in addition to walking around the house. During this time, he experienced a gradual decrease in symptoms and was able to eat a small meal. The patient returned to bed two hours after taking the medication and slept without any further interruptions.

At 3 am headache was migraine strength and was having full body aches (except for arms), extreme lower back and lower abdominal pain (he said it must be like what women experience in labor or during their menstrual cycle).   He got up and took temperature (normal) and blood ox (100 %SpO2 on two fingers).  He got a wet rag for eyes and tried to fall asleep.  He said he felt hot with cover on and cold with cover off.   At 5:50 am his father gave him two Motrin (400mg total), applesauce and a ice pack for his head and back.  I checked on him thru-out day and he seemed restless.  He woke up at 3 pm on 4/8/2021 said headache and major back pain/abdominal pains were gone. He still feels slightly achy, but fine otherwise. as of 8:24 pm.

He then had chills, fever of 101.2.  His pulse stayed at 95-100 beats per minute for 2 hours.  I spoke to a nurse friend of mine who told me to give him Tylenol and Benadryl.  His pulse went down to 80 beats per minute.  His fever went higher during the night but eventually broke.  Next morning he was still running a low grade fever and took Tylenol the rest of day.  He also had diarrhea on 2nd day and exhaustion.  3rd day feeling better but still tired.  No fever or diarrhea today.

It itched and burned and was difficult to sleep. No medication was taken, but by morning the rash was nearly gone and by midday it seemed to be gone. Around 5:00 PM, it started back again. I took Diphenhydramine because it appeared to be an allergic reaction. This helped me get to sleep. It was gone in the morning again, but started back in the evening again. This happened repeatedly for a total of 5 days.

Then the inside of my chest started getting really hot and my vision started going white in both of my eyes, it took about 10 seconds for me to completely lose vision. Then I passed out, I have no idea how long I was out for but when I came too I had a sort of epileptic-type seizure but I do not know how long it lasted. I woke up completely disoriented, had no idea where I was at and had a severe cognitive dysfunction. I still have moments where I just can&#39;t follow or complete a thought or just kind of go blank.

                                                At around 7PM the day of the J&amp;J vaccine, I began to feel very fatigued and could tell that I was going to come down with a fever. I went to bed early that day around 10PM. Woke up around 1:30AM on the 4th. Felt terrible and took my temperature. It read 101.5. Got up to use restroom and when washing hands, everything started to go blurry, I thought i had just become lightheaded and that it would pass so i stood there leaning against the bathroom door.I  ended up fainting and hitting my head on the cabinets. I was completely soaked in sweat.  An hour later we drove to the ER to make sure everything as okay. IV was started, some test performed, and fever was gone by 5AM. Felt completely fine after going home and resting for a few hours.

As they wrapped up and began to exit the room, the pharmacist noticed that he seemed confused and as if he was about to faint .  The pharmacist got him to the nearest chair.  He never lost consciousness, he was just dizzy.  He was given water and his pulse was taken.  The patient also reported at a later time he had just finished a long shift at work with little to eat or drink.

                                                The patient (self) felt a soreness around the site of the injection begin immediately and grow throughout the day. The soreness continued to at least April 12 (at the time of this report). The soreness was immediate unlike a tetanus shot but the pain the following days was 2-3 times less that of a tetanus shot. By 4pm the same day, the patient felt fatigue and tired and had difficulty staying awake. Around 6pm the patient took 200 mg of ibuprofen by mouth because of a strong headache. At 7pm the patient was experiencing the following: headache, warm head to the touch, shivering/shaking,  fatigue, mild aching. The patients pulse was consistent 100-104 bpm. The patients temperature at 8:30pm was 100.4 F. The patient then went to bed at 9pm. Patient had trouble falling asleep due to fever, shaking, aching. The patient slept intermittently until midnight. At midnight, the patient noticed the fever and shaking had ceased but the headache and aching were still strong. The aching was all over the body. The patients eyes hurt to move. The aching was constant and at times was throbbing. At 3am the patient could still not sleep well so he took 650 mg of Acetaminophen by mouth. The patient began to notice some relief approximately 30-60 min after. The patient fell asleep after the relief began and slept soundly til 9:15 am, April 11th. The patient awoke feeling much better. All side effects had stopped with the exception of a feeling of weakness and slight dizziness. The patient was able to carry on normally and took no more medications.

My entire body felt like burning and a headache came up not long after the fever.  I could barely fall asleep at night due to body ache and excessive sweating. The headache and body pain persisted till the next morning, and as of I am writing this response now, I feel extremely weak and I have no appetite at all.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  The vaccine was given at 10:45 AM. At 4:00 PM I began feeling nauseous. At 9:00 or 10:00 PM I began feeling both muscle and joint pain on my upper body which made it somewhat difficult to sleep. After one or two hours of sleep at 1:00 AM I woke up with a fever, headache, and worse muscle and joint pain (upper body only). When I woke up I was sweating profusely that the bed was lightly wet and extremely hot from all the heat my body was letting go. An ice pack can relieve the headache and fever. However, I was still not able to sleep. At 4:00 AM I made the decision to consume 800 mg of ibuprofen and it took 20 minutes for my headache and fever to go away. Yet, after being able to sleep for 30 minutes, I woke up again to the same headache and fever. Around 10:00 AM the symptoms were partly gone and was finally able to get sleep after a long night.

                                                Starting about 12 hours after my vaccine, I started to feel fatigue and body aches.  An hour after that I experienced intense chills and a sense of dread. I put a heater on myself with two layers of thick blankets, but it didn&#39;t help. My fingers and parts of my face started to tingle and go numb and I couldn&#39;t fall asleep in spite of me doing breathing exercises and lying down. Eventually the chills turned into a fever and my body temperature suddenly shot up. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer, but it was certainly over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Despite my relief from the chills, I still couldn&#39;t sleep.  I wasn&#39;t remarkably stressed/anxious, I just couldn&#39;t get to sleep. I&#39;m not typically an insomniac, and upon speaking to others who received the same vaccine, they&#39;ve also reported intense chills and an inability to fall asleep.

The next morning (Sunday) I woke up with a fever, chills, sweats, and fatigue that lasted until about 24 hours after I received the vaccine. The following day (Monday) I felt completely fine and had no adverse symptoms or side effects. Tuesday was fine as well until about 2pm after I ate lunch, during a meeting my arm went numb as well as my legs and I had trouble concentrating and could not hold a conversation. Went home and slept until Wednesday morning. Today, Wednesday, I am still not feeling normal and am having trouble concentrating at work, low light seems to help. No numbness today but still feel dazed and not able to focus

Leading up to the hear rate increasing I was fine and just enjoying my day. No drugs or alcohol or did not do any exercise that day. Felt uncomfortable and with some anxiety I visited a urgent care facility. The visit was about 45 minutes and left. As I am writing this, my heart rate is still a bit above normal but doing better.

                                                Patient admitted to being nervous prior to administration and said he did not like needles.  Patient was consulted about what to expect, side effects, and asked if he had any additional questions prior to receiving vaccination.  Patient declined and said he wanted to have the vaccine administered.  Patient sat down in the designated waiting area.  Approximately 2-5 minutes later patient blacked out and his body weight caused the chair he was sitting in to flip over, thus landing on the floor.  EMS was called.  Patient came to about 30-60 seconds later.  Patient was disoriented, sweaty, pale, and shaky.  Blood pressure was taken with a result of 143/95.  EMS arrived and evaluated the patient.  Patient admitted to having nothing to eat or drink today and being very anxious previous to getting the vaccine.  There were no signs of an allergic reaction.  Patient&#39;s blood pressure was checked about 20 minutes later and was returning towards normal.  Patient declined transport to the hospital, but mother was called to come pick him up.  Patient was advised to get something to eat soon and to rest and be observed for the next 24 hours.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At 11 PM the night of the vaccine (Saturday), extremely bad chills, fever and weakness set in almost immediately. I could not get my body to warm up and was borderline too weak to walk. Very bad headache and nausea set in as well.  After several hours the chills turned to intermittent sweating/cold and I could not keep a consistent body temp, nor sleep that night. The next morning  (Sunday) I had very bad aches and soreness, along with chills/fever and headaches that could be managed fine with around the clock acetaminophen. Around 8 PM that night, most of these flu like symptoms subsided. The following morning (Monday), still very exhausted despite a full 10 hours sleep. Tiredness and weakness lasted through the day. Tuesday morning until around 3 PM i still experienced drowsiness and was unable to gain strength for anything more than typical day to day tasks (could not workout). Wednesday morning, felt normal but while exercising experienced shortness of breath almost immediately as well as chest/lung pain easily. Come Thursday I feel 90% normal.

I had a fever of 101 all day long, a headache, my body was aching from head to toe, extreme lethargy, and occasional bouts of extreme nausea as well as throwing up twice. As of the following day (March 18), almost two days since receiving the shot, I feel pretty much completely normal again aside from a slight headache and some pain at the injection site still. I experienced some pretty bad side effects that only really lasted a day.

                                                Began feeling delirious around 7:00pm - uneasy and strange. Upon walking to the subway station, I felt overwhelmed with sudden depressive thoughts and anxiety.   On the Subway, I had a very severe, and disturbing panic attack. My vision became blurred and distorted, my heart rate spiked, and I became nauseous and extremely frightened. I sat down to try to maintain a sense of calm - but got off the subway after a few stops and met with a friend whom I had texted, to take care of me. From the point on, I was very shaken and agitated, and have been since the event.    I have never experienced anxiety, depression, or any such symptoms in my life before, nor was I nervous or anxious about having received the vaccine. The onset of the event was sudden, and seemingly out of nowhere, without real purpose, hence my conviction that it may have been spurred as a side effect from the vaccination.  I went to Urgent Care Sunday morning, April 11th, the morning after the event. My resting pulse was 97 BPM (normally 52-54) - and my blood pressure much higher than normal - 175/110. The doctor insisted I go home &#34;and relax&#34;.    I still feel uneasy and shaken from the event.

These symptoms lasted all night, but felt better in the morning. These symptoms were like COVID but x5. When I had the COVID-19 virus, my symptoms were not as bad as yesterday?s adverse effects from the vaccine. At 3 AM, I was considering going to the hospital and I have never been hospitalized before. I could barely open my eyes since the headache was so bad.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Starting on 4/11/21 at around 12:00 pm I started to have a numbness on both sides of my face. It felt as though there were pins and needles throughout my face. I would say that it was a 4/10 in terms of intensity. At first I thought maybe it was due to drinking coffee without food or other water (I don&#39;t regularly drink coffee but I have never had these symptoms from coffee before). However, even after eating food and drinking a sugary drink around 4:00 pm, the pins and needles remained. The symptoms began to subside at 6 pm or 7 pm.  The only other normal symptoms that I had were feeling tired on 4/8/21 and 4/9/21. Also, on 4/9/21 I had very slight muscle soreness throughout my body. I have also had difficulty concentrating which may or may not be related.

                                                On Monday 4/12/21, 5 days after taking the J&amp;J vaccine, I had an extremely itchy and painful full body rash. It was big red bumps like mosquito bites all over my body including legs, back, arms, chest, stomach, etc..I could not sleep all night due to the pain and itch and had to constantly apply cortisone cream as well as ice to make the pain bearable. The rash went away almost completely the following morning but then returned again the following night. I have never had any prior allergies or skin conditions and worry that this may become a recurring event since it has now happened for 2 nights. I did hear that a rash at the injection site was a possible side effect from the covid vaccines but this was way worse as it was all over my entire body.

Went to bed around 10:30 and woke up about 3 hours later at 1:30. Had chills and was shaking when I got up. Could not really fall back asleep. Chills turned into a fever. That morning I started to get a headache. I sounded congested at one point, but no runny nose. I also had body and joint aches.  I took Excedrin three times that day. Once in the morning, once in the afternoon, once before bed. I used zquil to sleep a little bit in the afternoon and again at night. I woke up Sunday and felt completely fine except for my arm still being sore.

                                                A week and a half approximately after the initial vaccination of the J&#43;J covid vaccine I started having a course of strange symptoms. Insomnia, inability to focus on things directly in front of me (a hand in front of my face would go out of focus automatically after a second), blurred vision, short term/long term memory loss, severe emotional issues, difficulty breathing, anxiety. Shortness of breath at a certain point was so bad I thought I was not going to make it. One very troublesome symptom that culminated after weeks of 4 hours of sleep was that my brain started feeling &#34;funny&#34;. The best way to describe it was a brain &#34;orgasm&#34; which I have never experienced before. At the same time I experienced dry heaving for several minutes, and severe shortness of breath. After this experience my symptoms gradually improved over the next week or two. Prior to this it felt like my brain was not getting enough oxygen/blood, which could have been feeding my insomnia. When I would try to sleep, I would wake up at 4 am gasping for air, as I felt like my breathing was labored when sleeping. I could not focus on my computer screen to do my job at home. Large amounts of melatonin seemed to help my brain feel better and get some rest. I took hydroxyzine for unrelated reasons prior to the vaccine injection as needed, however not too often. During  March I did not take it, as I had experienced disruptions in circadian rhythm due to the medication. I feel it is possible I had a blood clot that has been described in the news, although now there may be no way to know for sure. I talked with  my primary care physician about this, and he did not think this was the case because I was male. However I have a BMI of 18.7 and some issues females have such as TMJ and inability gain weight/anorexia diagnosis when younger. I also was recently diagnosed with an only recently described actual medical issue called R-CPD, which is the complete inability to burp or belch. I felt like during the time when I experienced the side effects, that this condition was heightened (bloating/loss of appetite). I lost quite a bit of weight during March, I usually weigh 135-140, and was down to 115 at a certain point. I am now back up to 130.   I now take sertraline at 1/4 pill dosage to treat the anxiety I experienced as a result of these symptoms as well as some other personal issues. I experienced severe side effects from the sertraline taking it at full dosage, and still experience some at 1/4 pill dosage.

About 5 minutes later  pharmacist was notified that the patient was feeling dizzy. As the pharmacist approached the waiting area, the patient and fainted and fell out of his chair. The pharmacist helped the patient sit up and he immediately regained his consciousness. The patient was assisted by being given a pillow and ice pack. He was monitored for over 30 minutes before leaving the clinic after recovering.   Patient claims to have fear of needles and had not eaten lunch prior to receiving vaccine but had never passed out before, but was states that they were very anxious.

                                                Thursday 4/8: 3:20pm: COVID injection given in right arm  Friday 4/9: ~1:00 am: woke up shaking with chills and severely cold; had slight headache. Had insomnia all night.   6:00 am: woke up with bad headache, slight fever.   7:00 am: got out of bed and had vertigo and was running into walls trying to walk to my living room, along with the worst migraine I?ve ever had. Also had dizziness, nausea,  chills, 100&#43;degree fever, aches, skin sensitive to touch, and severe tinnitus. All of the veins were visibly popping out of my head.   As the day went on, everything got worse. Any time I moved, my head would throb so bad that I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital.   3:45 pm:  the headache started to finally go away. It would only hurt if I moved fast. At this point my fever was only slightly high, about 99 degrees. I was still unstable when I walked and dizzy. I went from being super cold, to being super hot and sweaty. And I was alternating between cold &amp; hot and sweaty for the rest of the night. Was also having some memory issues, repeating things when I was having a conversation with someone over the phone.   I was sweating all night when I was sleeping.   Saturday 4/10: 7:00am: woke up with a slight headache; still out of it and dizzy.   8:00am: after being awake for about an hour or so, I looked in the mirror and my whole face (around the lips, cheeks, and jawline, and under the eyes) was really swollen and puffy. My face was even mis-colored. Under my eyes was purple and yellow, and my cheeks were white.   Some confusion persisted throughout the day as well as dizziness.

The chills and muscle pain were extremely intense 6 hours after I received my vaccine. I could not stop shivering, or get warm enough. That would be followed by a feeling that I was too warm and I would begin sweating profusely. I also experienced a few additional side effects I could not find listed:   I felt especially sensitive to stimuli as if normal sensations were heightened (e.g. hot water in a shower felt painful, running fingers through my hair felt like I was having my hair pulled, I kept my eyes squinted because the sunlight through the windows felt too bright.)  I was extremely irritable and became extremely frustrated easily. I mean frustrated to an embarrassing degree over small things that didn&#39;t matter. It was inconsistent with my day-to-day temperament. It felt like an adrenaline rush came in response to the most minor of inconveniences.

Pt. came to profusely sweating, pale, and feeling dizzy.  We took his BP and kept monitoring it for 45 minutes after we had him lay down.  His BP continued to rise and was normal.  Pt. was nervous before vaccine administration (shaking).  After event, Pt. stated this has happened in the past with donating blood.  Pt.&#39;s girlfriend picked him up, so he did not drive home.

I immediately grabbed another chair and raised his feet above his heart level. He immediately stated that he was &#34;feeling better&#34; and his vision was improving. I then offered him a cold bottle of water. He appeared very stable within a few minutes. We did call 911 as a precaution, they arrived a while later and deemed the patient was stable and their additional services were declined by the patient. I insisted the patient stay and finish the bottle of water. All together I believe the event was about 30 - 35 minutes before leaving. I encouraged the patient to drink plenty of fluids and electrolytes and to take it easy for the rest of the day.

                                                About 3 hours after getting the vaccine I started to feel short of breath. About 5 hours after that I got chills that made me shake all over because I got a fever of 103. Then 2 hours later my heart started to beat very rapidly and got up to 126 beats per minute, my heart was also not only beating vast but very very hard. Then throughout the night and all of the next day, I had pain in my chest on the left side and also pain in my rib area on the left side. The pain lasted for over 24 hours and because of that I went to the emergency room. It turned out they didn&#39;t find anything life threatening at the emergency room but all the pain I had was very scary and very uncomfortable. It was a terrible experience and because of it, I am telling people not to get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.

                                                After a few hours I know it is more common symptoms such as pain at the injection site, headache, fever, all over body soreness.   I also noticed short-term memory loss and mood changes from feeling of Happy and sad and angry from around 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.  and the feeling of complete uselessness and regretting getting the vaccine to the point I wanted to cry saying oh I made a mistake. Almost as if my body was trying to tell me this was a mistake.  Throughout the evening the all over muscle soreness and headache and fever seem to be getting worse I even woke up in the middle of night between 2:00 and 3:00 a.m. and took Tylenol PM to help go back to bed.   Started feeling better later in the afternoon on April 2nd. Almost if everything went away and back to normal.   I have noticed that I have been having more head pain (I normally have none) than normal since receiving the vaccine.

Over the subsequent 12 hours feelings of fogginess, nausea, headache, chills, and sweating increased, peaking at about 3a.m., including a low fever. Symptoms then began to slowly subside until by around 4p.m. the next day I felt mostly normal.

I received the shot Friday morning, by Friday evening the symptoms had appeared and worsened throughout the night and day on Saturday. By late evening(6-8) I began feeling much better. The symptoms included body aches, high fever, chills, nausea, hallucinations, dehydration, dizziness, loss of appetite,  exhaustion, and a restless night of sleep.

Wasn?t very noticeable and had some bad allergies that day so I chalked it up to that. About a week passes and it only slightly starts to get worse, and i can feel it in my feet as well. I was confused so I started asking about it around my work eventually it had started to affect my walking and it was clear something was wrong, I felt like I had lost balance in my legs and I was losing sense in my fingers. I stopped going to work and went to a doctor on 4/15.
