                                                High fever, extreme shaking and chills, nausea. I was pretty much immobile from 11pm-3am (until I was able to fall asleep) on the day of vaccination (3/8/21). This happened immediately after I showered with hot water. The next day  (3/9/21) until around 8pm I had a high fever, chills (not as bad but still pretty bad), headache, nausea, fatigue, and extreme muscle/joint pain particularly in my back and arms. I was unable to work, go to school, or do homework the entire day. After 8pm, I was down to a 100.4 fever and slight chills with mild nausea and fatigue. Today (3/10/21), I have mild muscle pain in my back and near the injection site. I took 400mg of ibuprofen every 6-8 hours from 3:00pm 3/8/21 (day of injection) to present with mild effects on pain and fever levels. I?m an infrequent user of ibuprofen. If I didn?t have someone with me the first night after the vaccination (3/8/21) I would have gone to the hospital.

Pharmacist called for follow up at 5:30 with fiancé and she stated that they had diagnosis of vasovagal syncope and that they were running more test.

                                                Within a minute of receiving the vaccine, patient slumped back in the chair, head back, eyes open. He was unresponsive and shaking in the chair. After about 20 seconds he came to and leaned forward but wasn&#39;t oriented to time and place. As I was talking to him, trying to assess his breathing, he slumped back in the chair and began shaking much more violently.  I asked the store director to call EMS at that point, I took his mask off at that point to better assess his breathing. After about 15 seconds, he came to again. At that point, I had him lean forward with his elbows on his knees, and he didn&#39;t lose conciousness after that. I took his blood pressure (70/22) and pulse (52, light and hard to find). EMS arrived soon after and at that point patient felt much better. EMS decided not to transport the patient to the ER. They instructed patient to follow up with his provider. Patient left the vaccine area under his own power about half an hour later.

                                                The patient began experiencing nausea and light-headedness around 11:00 P.M. on the 6th of April. Three hours later, he reported lower back pain that steadily increased in severity over the course of several hours. Throughout that same night, severe headaches and impaired kidney capacity (i.e. constant need to urinate about every hour) kept him from sleeping longer than two or three hours. Come morning of the 7th (roughly 8:30 A.M.), he took a single capsule of ibuprofen and performed various lower back stretches in addition to walking around the house. During this time, he experienced a gradual decrease in symptoms and was able to eat a small meal. The patient returned to bed two hours after taking the medication and slept without any further interruptions.

At 3 am headache was migraine strength and was having full body aches (except for arms), extreme lower back and lower abdominal pain (he said it must be like what women experience in labor or during their menstrual cycle).   He got up and took temperature (normal) and blood ox (100 %SpO2 on two fingers).  He got a wet rag for eyes and tried to fall asleep.  He said he felt hot with cover on and cold with cover off.   At 5:50 am his father gave him two Motrin (400mg total), applesauce and a ice pack for his head and back.  I checked on him thru-out day and he seemed restless.  He woke up at 3 pm on 4/8/2021 said headache and major back pain/abdominal pains were gone. He still feels slightly achy, but fine otherwise. as of 8:24 pm.

He was unconscious for about 15-20 seconds and came to. He was disoriented and complained of tingling in his hands. EMT was called non-emergency since the patient had regained consciousness. He still appeared disoriented for several minutes. Patient said he hadn&#39;t eaten since breakfast. He was given crackers and water. EMT arrived and took vitals. Patient appeared fine, just a bit shaky.

                                                Starting about 12 hours after my vaccine, I started to feel fatigue and body aches.  An hour after that I experienced intense chills and a sense of dread. I put a heater on myself with two layers of thick blankets, but it didn&#39;t help. My fingers and parts of my face started to tingle and go numb and I couldn&#39;t fall asleep in spite of me doing breathing exercises and lying down. Eventually the chills turned into a fever and my body temperature suddenly shot up. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer, but it was certainly over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Despite my relief from the chills, I still couldn&#39;t sleep.  I wasn&#39;t remarkably stressed/anxious, I just couldn&#39;t get to sleep. I&#39;m not typically an insomniac, and upon speaking to others who received the same vaccine, they&#39;ve also reported intense chills and an inability to fall asleep.

The next morning (Sunday) I woke up with a fever, chills, sweats, and fatigue that lasted until about 24 hours after I received the vaccine. The following day (Monday) I felt completely fine and had no adverse symptoms or side effects. Tuesday was fine as well until about 2pm after I ate lunch, during a meeting my arm went numb as well as my legs and I had trouble concentrating and could not hold a conversation. Went home and slept until Wednesday morning. Today, Wednesday, I am still not feeling normal and am having trouble concentrating at work, low light seems to help. No numbness today but still feel dazed and not able to focus

                                                Immediately after getting the vaccine, I was extremely fatigued and disoriented for the rest of that day (April 6th), to the point that I had to leave work. The following day (April 7th) I was still fatigued and was constantly out of breath, however I was able to work, albeit not to the best of my abilities.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At 11 PM the night of the vaccine (Saturday), extremely bad chills, fever and weakness set in almost immediately. I could not get my body to warm up and was borderline too weak to walk. Very bad headache and nausea set in as well.  After several hours the chills turned to intermittent sweating/cold and I could not keep a consistent body temp, nor sleep that night. The next morning  (Sunday) I had very bad aches and soreness, along with chills/fever and headaches that could be managed fine with around the clock acetaminophen. Around 8 PM that night, most of these flu like symptoms subsided. The following morning (Monday), still very exhausted despite a full 10 hours sleep. Tiredness and weakness lasted through the day. Tuesday morning until around 3 PM i still experienced drowsiness and was unable to gain strength for anything more than typical day to day tasks (could not workout). Wednesday morning, felt normal but while exercising experienced shortness of breath almost immediately as well as chest/lung pain easily. Come Thursday I feel 90% normal.

                                                I experienced slight nausea the night I received the vaccine. The following morning was miserable. I had a fever of 101 all day long, a headache, my body was aching from head to toe, extreme lethargy, and occasional bouts of extreme nausea as well as throwing up twice. As of the following day (March 18), almost two days since receiving the shot, I feel pretty much completely normal again aside from a slight headache and some pain at the injection site still. I experienced some pretty bad side effects that only really lasted a day.
