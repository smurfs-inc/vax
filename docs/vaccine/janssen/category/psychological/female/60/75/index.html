Overall I felt as if I had a terrible case of the flu. It was very intense. I was unable to sleep the first night due to the severity of symptoms. The second night I sweated a tremendous amount and my fever broke. I am still not over all of my symptoms but I am feeling better.

Most of the hives are on the torso, more severe on the front and some on the back.  A few have been on my arms.  After going back to sleep, the hives are gone when get up for the day.  No hives during the day.  Then awakened by hives again at 4am or 5am.  Prior to receiving the one-dose Janseen COVID-19 vaccine,  had only experienced hives three times in my life, several years apart.  Now it has occurred early every morning seven times in a row and expect it will happen again, since the ones this morning were worse than the previous few times.

I felt like I hit a wall. My body just ached. I took some Ibuprofen and continued my shift. I woke up the next day with a headache so bad that I couldn&#39;t lift my head off of the pillow. I took Tylenol and that continued the entire day. I stayed in bed all day. The next night, I woke up in the middle of the night with chills, but no temperature. The following Monday, I still had the chills along with nausea. By Tuesday, I felt normal again.

The pinpoint soreness was vague and lingering until the middle of the night last night when the intense pain woke me from my sleep.  It isn&#39;t bursa pain it is deltoid pain more intense than I ever imagined it could be especially at the two week mark post vaccine!! It is pretty terrible.

                                                Sensitivity started within four hours of dose. Autistic sensitivities to maximum. Scrambling of all senses including proprioception to the point of not being able to move from standing  or sitting. By hour seven, all sensory inputs were too overwhelming to do anything but shut down and sleep. 911 was not an option because they don&#39;t let you sleep, and ERs are overwhelming already, before maximizing all inputs. 7.5 mg hydrocodone for overwhelming pain and sensitivity, allowed sleep. On waking, sensitivity was lessened, but the pain started, 18 hours after the vaccination. Emotional lability for three days. Average aching of arm and injection site were not above expected levels. &#34;Brain fog&#34; and lack of ability to articulate (another autism symptom) started within that first seven hours, and diminished over next ten days. Not yet gone as of today  Dry mouth; overproduction of thick &#39;chunky&#39; mucus that wouldn&#39;t cough out, treated with guaifenesin, lasted three days. Shortness of breath and cough associated with that mucus also diminished after three days. Not completely gone ten days later.   Excessive thirst, onset two hours after vaccine, lasted two days.   Hyperalert (can&#39;t sleep without drugs), hyperactive despite weakness, and hypervigilant (extreme startle reflexes) lasted three days as well. Sleep was achieved with hydrocodone and THC.  All over body pain, feelings of immune mobilization (coming down with) for two days were not above expected levels.   No fainting or other collapse at time of injection, or later.  Knowing that severe over-stimulation is exacerbated in a medical setting, it was decided not to seek medical support for three days of systemic symptoms that would have easily merited hospitalization.

                                                Shot immediately started stinging.  My upper arm swelled with a hard ridge about 3 inches long and 1 inch wide.  Extremely painful.  Could barely raise my arm and could not sleep on that side or tolerate even soft touch of my entire upper arm.  No other reaction that seemed like an allergic response.  I did get very sick for 2 days with severe flu symptoms and strange shooting pains in random parts of my body.  Enough pain to wake me from a sound sleep.  Bad chills, but no fever. I did. I give my legs seemed swollen for about 3 days.   I got the J&amp;J vaccine on 3-6-21 and my arm is still swollen with a slightly smaller hard and painful ridge at the injection site and it sometimes throbs and itches severely.  Today is 4-2-21.  Starting to wonder if it will ever go away.  I still cannot sleep on that side.  The pain overall is less, but it still throbs and itches periodically throughout the day.

Significant headache presented in front and sides of head (near temples), beginning day 1 after injection, with duration of 4 days. 3. Fatigue presented on day 1 after injection, duration of 4 days. 4. Mental health symptoms after day 1, with duration of 5 days, presenting as feelings of sadness and depressive ideation.   The last symptom (#4) is difficult for me to correlate specifically to the vaccination, as I am a 60 year-old and in my first year in a rigorous doctoral program at a hospital. The negative physical symptoms experienced by the injection could have added an extra layer to the sadness that I reported from the daily app check-ins. I already operate (since fall 2020) in an overwhelmed state (while beginning a difficult academic program via Zoom). Could the physical fatigue and headaches from the vaccine lead to the feelings of sadness? Or were the feelings of sadness a third symptom of the vaccine? I cannot answer, and therefore cannot provide this correlation link with any reliability.  I did speak to my therapist via Zoom, and reached out via email to my general physician (who recommended OTC meds.

Honestly - I&#39;m very healthy and getting Covid directly from another person couldn&#39;t have been worse than getting  the vaccine.  :(   And I am even saying that as a 35 year professional Research Scientist.

The NP on site said she was unable to find a pulse so did 10 chest compressions before I woke up. Called the rescue squad who did an EKG on route to Hospital and once I was in the ER another EKG was performed along with blood work and chest X-ray. Entry was noted as allergic reaction but diagnosis was noted as Vasovagal Syncope, Adult. EKG?s performed along with labs were normal. I have pulled muscles, tendons and ligaments from the chest compressions which were questionable but since that day have experienced tingling in upper body and arms and have felt bad. Went back to my Primary Care Doctor for follow up on March 29 for another EKG. Have had panic attacks from the situation and per Doctor will take 2 months for my chest, muscles, tendons and ligaments to heal. Hard to determine if the way I have felt is from the vaccine or what transacted when I fainted. Today which is April 9, I still feel weak, normally I am very energetic. Just wanted to report as when I saw the news that others had some situations thought best to let you know.

                                                Was doing CDC TEXT tracing first week after injection, but new reactions started after tracking completed. Had mild reactions originally. Pain in arm, and fever next day that rose to 100.9. No chills, no major problems, no rash. A couple nose bleeds on second day which were not typical for me. Returned to work on third day. Now on day 10 I&#39;m convinced I&#39;m having a delayed reaction. Still mild but present. Low temp 99.5, headache, fatigue, feeling of not being normal. Not allowed to work today. Reason for report of such mild symptoms is my surprise of this delayed reaction 10 days later. There is a bruise on my injection arm now, opposite side of arm, that also is puzzling, but not really worrisome. Know to monitor for platelet issues.

I went to work on Tuesday because my work was short staffed but was allowed to go home 3 1/2 hours early.  I took Advil every 4-6 hours on Tuesday and half of Wednesday.  I came straight home and slept until dinner, ate and then went back to bed and slept until midnight, took more Advil and drank a full glass of water, and slept the rest of the night.  Wednesday I felt a bit better, headache not as bad and jaw pain not as frequent, still pretty tired.  I went to bed straight after dinner and then felt great on Thursday.

                                                I got an itchy rash on my right leg within the first 15 minutes, staff at the site tried to get me to belief it was from anxiety. The redness subsided though bumps remained when they let me go home. I also felt a bit &#34;detached&#34; on the drive home and really had to concentrate on my driving. Once home, I still felt odd but went about my day. About four hours later, I realized I was scratching my stomach and chest while watching TV. Upon raising my shirt, I saw a bright red rash on the top part of my belly that extended underneath both breasts and to the area directly over my heart, and up my left side into my left armpit. All of these areas were very itchy. I put Hydrocortisone cream on them, which helped reduce the itching quite quickly. I then took half a Benadryl tablet. When I awoke the next morning, the areas that had been bright red now had dark red dots but did not itch. However, I had lines of a bright red, itchy rash on both thighs near my groin. I again applied Hydrocortisone cream and took Benadryl, which helped abate the symptoms. Lymph nodes in my left armpit were quite sore as well, so I took ibuprofen.

I kept waking up scared.  I started to have a flare up of my Arthritis. I still have feelings of tiredness, headaches and my back has been really flared up. I have a disability with my spine being crooked. The pain has been a lot worse than normal. I have been visiting the Chiropractor frequently three weeks after my shot. I did not have as much back pain before the vaccine.

                                                Developed heart palpitations approximately 10 hours after receiving vaccine. Also insomnia  making it impossible to sleep.  Palpitations seemed to get better by 11 am the next morning but my heart rate was still elevated ( pulse 106-112).  Shortly after that ( around 11:45 am) I became extremely light headed and dizzy and felt like I was going to pass out. I also started to feel nauseous and sweaty.   I rested lying down for two hours before hearing back from my doctor&#39;s office.  I was able to control the lightheadedness and dizziness by lying down. The feeling of passing out / nearly fainting went away.  I continued to feel nauseous and my  heartrate was still elected. I started to get a headache as well.  On the advise of a nurse at my doctor&#39;s office,  my husband took me to the ER.  My EKG was normal . My heartrate was elevated.  Due to the overcrowding at the ER that day I was made to wait at least an hour and half for further evaluation.  I continued to feel light headed and slightly dizzy. My nausea and headache got much worse .  I was finally taken back to a treatment room and received IV fluids, Zofran and Tylenol.  My heartrate went back to normal and my headache and nausea improved with treatment and I was discharged around 7pm.  I continued to feel very tired and slightly lightheaded that evening. The next morning  I was much more nauseous again and still very weak feeling and slightly lightheaded. I have  continued to feel weak, very fatigued , unwell and nauseous on and off until today, April 14, which is 6 days after I was vaccinated.

                                                On 4/16/21, patient reported that following vaccination on 4/8/21 around 9:45 am: ...&#34;The feeling of being light headed began around 10:30  am while I was sitting at my computer.  Six days after the vaccine, I actually went to bed with severe cold chills which lasted several hours.  I am still experiencing intermittent periods of &#34;brain fog&#34; or at times feeling a little light headed.  Last Saturday was the only day that I haven&#39;t experienced feeling this way.  Again, it does not happen all of the time but it is bothersome. I am hopeful that after this Thursday (2 weeks will have passed since the vaccine) that symptoms will disappear. If not, I will follow up with my family practitioner.  Thank you!&#34;

                                                Day one post vaccination - dull headache, leg pain, abdominal pain, back pain - these symptoms continued for a few days, I started to feel a bit better, did not take any pain reliever medications because I didn&#39;t want to mask symptoms.   On 4/14/21, 7 days post vaccination, my leg pain in both legs worsened including numbness and a burning sensation in both feet.  Back pain continued, arm pain started in both arms with numbness in both hands however the pain on my left side with legs and arms is worse. I&#39;ve had intermittent shooting pains in my left ear, left jaw, left temple and across the left side of my face. I&#39;ve also experienced shoulder and neck pain. The abdominal pain is intermittent and mild. On 4/15 - 4/18 the pain in my legs was so bad that it was waking me up at night and my arm pain was occurring more frequently. I decided to go to the ER on 4/18, day 11 post vaccination, due to my concern of a possible DVT or other type of blood clot.  The ER physician&#39;s assistant did not look at my legs but did several blood tests and other tests.

My husband said I was in/out for about 10 minutes as he was trying to help me up. Right side of nose/head still has problems.

Woke on Friday  3/19/21 with fatigue and diarrhea with body aches.  Woke Saturday 3/20/21 with fever 101.7. (During this duration to include today I have  taken Tylenol rotating with Motrin every 2 hours, this never broke my fevers). Fever continues on and off with body aches, nausea, the worst headache I have ever experienced and pain in the base back of my neck L side.  These symptoms have continued since Saturday.  It is now Friday, 3/26/21.  I will say that during waking hours 8am - 10pm on Wednesday 3/24/21 and Thursday 3/25/21 I had no symptoms except absolute fatigue.  The fever returned on those two nights at around midnight with it breaking about 4 am, waking up in a pile of sweat.

                                                Whether the adverse events were caused by the vaccine is to be determined.  We are available to discuss more details if this information can be used to help others from experiencing these reactions.  The morning after getting the vaccine, patient discovered that she could not swallow.  As her condition worsened, she was taken to the emergency room.  Over the past month, patient went to the emergency room 4 times.  The last time resulted in extended hospitalization that continues to this day.  In addition to the swallowing problem, two other major adverse events need to highlighted.  First, on 27 March, while in the hospital, vaginal bleeding started.  On 29 March, her doctor, performed a hysteriscopy/DNC finding &#34;  &#34;an unexplained blood clot (hematoma).&#34;  The second major event was when patient demonstrated significant confusion and lack of memory.  On 7 April, she was diagnosed with Metabolic Encephalopathy.  Neurologists at the hospital suspected that her MS was reacting to her UTI and once the infection is eliminated her memory should come back.  But as of 10 April, she was still having issues including hallucinations.  Although she is eating some as of 13 April, she is still very weak and will likely by moved from the Hospital to a rehab facility.  She still does not remember much of the last 37 days.

                                                Right after shot, did not feel anything that morning till around 5pm I started to feel feverish, headache, tired.  My arm never got sore or swollen.  AFter 5pm till, the feverish feeling and hot cold got worse as time went by and I started shaking uncontrollably - pretty severe.  I took Tylenol early hoping to stop the achy feverish and shaking but did not seem to help.  THis went to till about 1am or 2am when I could finally lay down and try to sleep.  The shaking had stopped.  I did take more Tylenol and drank some herbal chamole type of hot tea.  I could not sleep that night.  Next day I was exhausted, body aches and still had some feverish feeling.  By the way, took my temperature and it was normal.  Then on Wednesday, I believe is when I had a huge episode of diarrhea (came on sudden).  I kept calling and talking virtually to the doctor telling him all of what was going on.  The next day I the feverish feeling and body aches and being tired kept happening  - adding headache getting worse.  I kept taking Tylenol.  Seem to help some but did not take the pain away. EAch night , I could not sleep due to the headache.  I started to feel better but then on the weekend, I had that headache and tired feeling.  The headache was getting stronger and it circled my whole head and both shoulder and around my neck.  It scared me because I felt at times that my throat was getting smaller.  I could still swallow but it was so strange.  I kept putting heat packs and ice packs and taking Tyelnol.  I know that on Thursday or Friday the week, the doctor told me if I wanted to to go get tested for Covid and I did.  I was tested negative on both the quick test and the other test that takes longer.     I had that headache, sinus tension pressure for quite a few more days.  Overall it took 7 days. I had to take off  most of the week from my telework job because I could not function.  I also did not eat much and drank lots of water during this time.  It seem to go away and then about a week later, I got this painful diarrhea out of the blue and went to see an urgent care doctor.  They tested me for blood, urine, and stool and they were negative.  I was also having pain on my left side.  Then it seem to go away after I was on the BRAT diet for a few more days.  Then the diarrhea happened again the next week or so.  This week, as of yesterday, I got a very strange throbbing pain in my left hand and not sure where that came from.  It can be extreme at times.  I tool Tyleonol but the pain is still there.  Also, during this time and before the shot, I got a trigger finger issue on my right index finger.  I don&#39;t think that has anything to do with the vaccine.  Please note I have been told my doctors and I know this for a fact, my body is super sensitive to food, meds.  I don&#39;t usually get the flu shot because of that.  Today I am experiencing the left hand pain and now metal tasting in my mouth.  I am about 5 weeks out from the vaccine.  I wish I had never taken it.  I pray nothing more will happen  in my body  If I have left anything off it is because I did not write this down when was happening.  I really thought I was going to die one night because of the pressure I was having in my head, neck and shoulders.   I have a little bit of a headache now and told my PT doctor that if I needed to know, I could get a brain or some kind of scan to see if I am hainvg any issues. I am going to bring this up to my virtual call today.

At that time, it was determined the patient had suffered an age-indeterminant ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion. No neurosurgical interventions were done at this time as patients symptoms have appeared to improve after observation.

On March  28 (approaching 7 months after my illness) I was still positive for Covid Antibodies prior to the vaccine.

Patient reports that she felt lightheaded after the vaccine when she was leaving. She got home and felt better but then that night woke up in a delirium which passed by the morning. She had some weakness in her extremities, brain fog, cold feeling, funny GI feeling and fatigue for 3 days and then was fine.   Two weeks ago she started to feel that the circulation in her lower legs was cut off with sensation of blood pooling in her legs with associated numbness and tingling. She describes it as what you feel when a tourniquet is applied to your arm.  No visible lower extremity swelling, redness and no pain.    One week ago she felt like her right hand was not working well and then left hand too. She then felt pooling in her arms like the sensation in her legs.No swelling, redness or pain.   She reports she did a hand stand and afterward felt pooling sensation in her lower abdomen which has since resolved but continues to have a prickling sensation that comes and goes.   Last night while lying on her back she felt the pooling sensation in her chest and this morning throbbing in head and chest and neck. That is when she decided to come in and be seen.    Patient denies severe headache, backache, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, bruises, unusual bleeding or rashes.   Patient has not had a physical exam with blood work since 11/9/17.

I got chills and fever, but didn&#39;t take my temperature. The next morning, took my temperature and it was 101. Ate a piece of coffee cake with some tea. Was very tired, so went back to  bed. Was also a bit queasy, and not hungry for lunch, and had a mild headache. Slept most of the day, had chills and fever off and on, and joints very sore. I did eat dinner. The next day I was much better, but still had some soreness in my joints, one or two episodes of mild chills, was somewhat tired and lethargic. The next day I was more or less back to normal. I did take Tylenol at some point, but I can&#39;t remember if it was the afternoon of the first day of fever, or not until the next afternoon. I know I did take it again the next morning.  All in all, it felt like a full-blown case of the flu, but was of short duration.

                                                She received her vaccine, and on 4/9/21 she developed a severe ringing in her right ear really loud.  It then just kept getting worse and worse and then went to the other ear. Then there was a buzzing at night inside her head.  She started getting head tremors inside of her head, and it has not stopped as of 4/29/21.  She called her doctor and talked to him and he gave her Zyrtec, however, she is very very sensitive to medications so she could not take a lot of it.  It didn&#39;t help the right ear which is the worst one.  The left ear just started to subside a little bit.  It has now been on and off, but still pretty severe in the right ear.  The head tremors feel like shaking inside of her head which are not apparent from the outside, and the buzzing.  She had another phone APT again and she is scheduled to see a specialist an ENT on 5/3/21 as the condition is debilitating.  She is not able to sleep, eat or function due to this condition.

Her blood pressure was 174/86 and her pulse was fluctuating in the mid-high 80s. I administered 1 tablet of diphenhydramine (25mg) and 1 dose of the 0.3mg epi-pen. After about 7-10 minutes, she said her symptoms started to level out and were no longer getting worse. Her lip swelling started going down by the time EMS arrived. I continuously checked her blood pressure, heart rate, and heart rhythm while waiting for EMS to arrive and take over her care. They took her to the closest emergency room for continued monitoring.

I woke up and I was talking gibberish. I was aware that nothing I said was making sense. I went to bed and slept almost 24 hours. I woke up feeling wiped out but I wasn&#39;t confused and I was talking normal again. Right arm hurt and is numb. ( right side of my body typically is kind of numb but the right arm seemed more so numb after the vaccine)

I threw up until about midnight for a total of 7 times. The night before I had difficulty sleeping. The next morning I felt nauseous again and threw up about 10:00 a.m. I started having diarrhea which has lasted through today (Thursday) and I had lost over 5 pounds in just 3 days and my weight is still over 5 pounds less today because it is difficult to eat much. Sunday I was feeling pain around my lest breast where I had had my mastectomy in June of 2006. That eased up the next day.  Feeling stressed because I have bad tinnitus and was worried about a reaction.

After sitting up from laying position pt states she was dizzier, repeated BP at 1427, no improvement. Gave pt juice b/c she felt shaky and thinks it&#39;s because she hasn&#39;t eaten.

Per pt&#39;s visitor her color had returned to normal, pt still feels a little shaky. Pt rested another 5 mins, repeated vitals and pts BP was elevated. Discussed with pt and visitor that due to her hx of HTN and her already being on BP meds, pt should be seen in ER and EMS called. Explained that she should have an EKG done b/c of flutters and HTN along with headache. Educated pt on importance of being seen in ED. Gave pt and visitor time to discuss suggestion, when returning pt states, &#34;Talked to niece who is EMT and said I should be fine if I just went home, rested, ate, and checked BP and took another BP pill (1/2) like suggested with doc before getting ahold of physician. All they&#39;ll do in ED is continue to check BP&#34;. Advised pt that ED would do more than that. Pt refused EMS and wished to go home. Pt visitor stated that they would watch patient and if anything changed take to ED. Patient left clinic in wheelchair and assisted to vehicle. Pt denies any symptoms that she initially presented with but states she just feeling weak.

Then, headache started and was quickly very severe.  Accompanied by fever and chills. Slept for 24 hours, woke up for five minutes and slept for another six hours.  Though I felt better within 36 hours, I would not call the side effects mild.  Still feel lightheaded and having difficulty sleeping.

Mental fogginess began at 8 PM (8 hrs after shot) and lasted until late the next evening Chills began at 8:30 PM and continued until early Friday AM. There were also a few instances of hot flashes in between the chills. About 10 hours after the shot the following began: headache (I rarely get headaches), nausea, muscle aches - mostly my quadriceps, low back pain, pain in the back of my neck, general lethargic feeling. These all lasted into Thursday evening, except the low back pain, which lasted into Friday AM. I felt a dull pain in all my back teeth that lasted about a day and was intermittent.

Then began to get headache with slight fever and the headache got progressively worse, with nausea and rapid heart rate. The headache was so bad I could not sleep at all - the worst headache I have ever had. I took one extra-strength Tylenol at about 10 or 11 am the next day, March 12, which took the edge off the headache. The headache diminished till it was gone by about 8 or 9 pm. The rapid heart rate, along with tiredness, low energy, and feeling jittery continued for several days, then stopped.

                                                I called a message that patient had experienced a stroke recently and had also rececived the Jansson vaccine. I called patient, who had reported that it happened on 4/2. She had woke up and couldn&#39;t put her robe on. Her left arm was not working right. She also noted  that she had drooled. She kept thinking that she was find and got ready and went to work. During work she was typing and found that her left hand was not working still, but still went throughout her day and typed with her right hand. Later that evening when she got home, her husband took her to the ER. There, she reports that her blood pressure was through the roof. She had a CT scan and MRI and labs done and was diagnosed with a TIA. She was started on Plavix, baby aspirin, and was started on a statin drug (couldn&#39;t remember the name as that information was at home and she was at work at time of call). She is on a heart monitor for 4 weeks and has follow ups with her outside PCP and cardiologist. Today she states that she is feeling back to normal and has regained function on her left side. She reports that she had a headache at time that had lasted for a while. She also reports that she feels like she was having issues weeks before because her brain felt foggy and just was not thinking right.

                                                On Tuesday, April 6, 2021, about 11:45 am, I felt a sudden sharp pain in the right temple area just above eye level and about 2 inches posterior.  I also felt some dizziness and wondered if I was having a stroke or some type of arterial inflammation.  At the time I was treating a patient and wondered if I was going to have to leave to go home.  I did get through the rest of my workday but had difficulty concentrating.  I had recurring waves of pain in the same area several times that day and into the evening, was considering alerting my adult daughter that I might need to go to a hospital.  Fortunately, resting and increased fluids seemed to resolve the pain and it was mostly gone by the next day.

Every tooth in my mouth started throbbing at around 11 hrs  and continued for about 5 more hours. Also during that time, waves of nausea but no vomiting, also uncontrollable shivering but I wasn&#39;t cold and I wasn&#39;t hot but weird shivering. I did not take my temperature as I didn&#39;t feel like I had a fever. Around 13 hrs after a stabbing pain in front of thighs like hot pokers started and around 14 hrs thigh pain was still present but then the calves on both legs started to get the same stabbing pain.   At around 24 hrs after - headache remained, pulsating teeth stopped, thigh pain stopped but calf pain remained. Headache remained off and on for several days. General brain fog also lasted for about 1 week. The calf pain comes and goes even after 2 weeks. Arm where shot was administered was very tender to the touch for the last 2 weeks.   Lastly, I wouldn&#39;t say I had shortness of breath but at times I just felt like I needed to stop and force myself to take a very deep breath.

The manager came and got me and we went to her.  She was seated and I gave her water.  After about 10 minutes she said she felt better and said she wanted to leave.  I walked her to her car, helped her load her groceries in the car and she left with her sister.  An incident report was written by store management

The symptoms seemed minor, and at the time, no reports had linked the Johnson vaccine and blood clots. But the following week, when symptoms began cases started to emerge. The patient hadn&#39;t panic by reading the reports, but concern did creep in (anxious) and heart rate fast. The patient had never battled serious illness, certainly nothing related to blood clots. Patient thought, might have a reaction. On 21-APR-2021, patient still wasn&#39;t feeling well and decided to make an appointment at the urgent care center.

                                                In the evening I started to feel aches in my eyes and joints.  I was having trouble falling asleep.  I woke up every 2 hours. My heart bpm went up to 102 in the middle of the night.  I know this because my fit bit was vibrating and encouraging me to keep exercising and I was just laying in bed trying to sleep.  I finally got up around 2:30 in the morning and took 1 Aleve. I also took my temperature with a forehead type and it was 98.5, so no high fever.  I took another Aleve around 7:00 in the morning.  Now I am feeling fine.  It&#39;s now 8:22 a.m. and I am working from home.  I just wanted to report that the aches in joints and 102 bpm and unable to fall asleep were my side effects.  I feel fine now.  I will continue to take Aleve as needed.   I have never been tested for Covid.  I have never had any symptoms to warrant testing for covid.  Since March 13, 2020 I have been fortunate to work for a company that has us all working from home.  We are still working from home.  i am 63 years old.  I shop around 6 a.m. in the morning for groceries to avoid people. I do not go out.  I have been very careful.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Based on the paperwork I received at my vaccination, I am reporting my side effects for your records.  I received the dose (1805029) on 3/12/2021 (Friday) at 4:30 in the afternoon. At around 10:30 p.m. I began to feel unwell with chills, shaking/tremors of my hands/arms, and overall aches. I had trouble sleeping through the night due to these symptoms in addition to night sweats (fever).  These conditions persisted through the next day (Saturday) and evening (24 hours).  I managed to sleep 8 hours and had only a headache the following morning (Sunday).  I treated my symptoms by taking Tylenol which was helpful.  Hope this helps with your research/records.

Took Tylenol and it helped for about 3 hours.    03/15/2021 Woke up with symptoms again around 2:30 am and took Tylenol.  Woke up around 8 am with slight headache and VERY tired.  Kept a nagging headache and &#34;brain fog&#34; all of the day  and tired.  Took Tylenol and it helped some.  I felt a bit foggy all day even with Tylenol.  3/16/2021 Still felt tired with a bit of a headache on and off. Took Tylenol and it helped.    I don&#39;t take meds often so I just took 500 mg Tylenol, 1 tablet. I am healthy with no underlying conditions and do not have reactions to the flu shot.  I expected the same  with this shot.

Lot of congestion and a runny nose.  I also got a stomach ache later in the evening.  by the time I went to bed around 10 pm I hurt all over and was very sick to my stomach.  I felt like if someone touched my skin my bones and muscles would all shattered.  I did not sleep much that night and woke up on Saturday, the 27th with the same symptoms but not quite as bad.  I still had nausea and a stomach ache and was very tired and drained.  I did start to get diarrheic around 3:30, 4:00.  I still hurt and have diarrheic and am very tired today, which is Tuesday, the 30th of March at 5:15 pm.

                                                She got the vaccine, had no reaction initially and then went home and was tired, slept for a couple of hours and felt good.  When she went to bed had a fever under 101 degrees, and really bad headache and then muscle pain all the way down to her calves to the point that she was sick to her stomach.  This continued throughout the night.  This morning she is still having the chills, so believes she has a temperature, feels miserable.  About 1:30 AM she took 2 Tylenol for her symptoms.

She reported onset of headache and fatigue day of vaccine. She reported later feeling short of breath and having a  decreased tolerance of activity.  She stated she had an elevated heartrate and &#34;neurological symptoms&#34;, but did not specify. She reports still feeling off at this time 4/13 and having appointments scheduled with a Vascular surgeon and neurologist in the near future. I am doing the reporting as the vaccine was given by Public Health staff, but this is the first notification we have received of the her potential adverse reaction.

On the 12th had severe chest pains which I chalked up to a very bad case of heart burn.  On March 24th, while driving I had two major (what I thought at the time) was panic attacks...body started shaking, heart was beating like crazy, couldn&#39;t catch my breath, felt like I was going to pass out or die.  Had to pull over twice to calm myself down.  (From what I read this could be a sign of a blood clot but I am not a doctor.)  Had minor heart burn until April 5th....which ironically was the end of my 28 days until the vaccine fully kicked in.  Just reporting what happen.  I feel fine now.

I had to regulate my breathing by slowing it down. When I opened my eyes the light was so bright I had to keep them closed. I thought I was going to faint. I finally decided to put my head between my legs and then I started too pullout of it.  Very scary feeling.   This lasted for 10min.

                                                During the week of 3/29/21 (the week following my vaccine), I began to experience periodic lower abdominal pain (lower right and lower center) during movement (walking or going from sitting to standing.   On Monday, 4/5/21 (13 days after my vaccine), I began experiencing severe abdominal pain upon getting out of bed at 7am.  The pain was worse with movement of any kind (walking, turning, going from sitting to standing).  I was convinced something was seriously wrong, and called my Dr&#39;s office .  While waiting for the NP to call me, I decided that I should go to the hospital.  My husband drove me, and even the car ride there was painful (bumps and turns).  The pain upon standing was as if my bladder was going to fall out.  The pain when walking was a stabbing type of pain in my lower right abdomen and a stretching sensation in my center/lower abdomen. The E.R. Dr  diagnosed me with epiplogic appendagitis, and instructed me to rest, hydrate, and take tylenol. I followed the Drs advice.  I took 4/5&amp;6 off from work, spending most of that time in a reclining position in my livingroom and I drank plenty of water. I felt noticeable improvements daily.  I saw my PCP  for a follow-up visit on 4/8 for an abdominal exam, at which time I was experiencing pain primarily in bed (in a stretched out position) and periodically with movement (walking and going from sitting to standing or turning).  I had my second follow-up today with my PCP (4/15).  I continue to improve daily.

I felt very fatigued and my eyes hurt so much and I could not keep them open. On 04-06-2021 I still was not feeling well. I started to have problems with my right side of my face, eyes and mouth which gradually got worse so I went to the hospital. At the hospital they checked me for stroke, performed lab work, did MRI and CT scans and the  the doctors came back and said it was Bell&#39;s palsy. I again went to the hospital 04-11-2021 but this time due to GI issues with pain.  On 04-14-2021 through 04-15-2021, I started to experience neck pain behind my right ear. At the hospital they had prescribed my prednisone 50mg, so I took half for my pain.  I still have trouble sleeping and have lots of pain.

                                                I received the vaccine on a Saturday evening and by Sunday morning, I was sick as a dog with flu like symptoms - massive headache, terrible backache (like someone kicked me in the back), chills and fever.   Sunday evening in the middle of the night, in bed, I was shaking so badly from chills that I was afraid to get up to get Tylenol.  I finally did and I couldn&#39;t even focus my eyesight and control my hands as I went to open the bottle of pills that my hands were shaking so badly that I spilled them all over the place.   Finally I woke my husband who heated up blankets in the dryer and brought me hot tea.  My husband helped me to the bathroom where I vomited.  I cannot remember when I was so sick.  I missed work that day at my part-time job and the next day at my full time job as a teacher.

Approximately a week later, the patient experienced stomach cramps and diarrhea and 1.5 weeks later she had foggy feeling in head and &#34;believes the vaccine is contaminated&#34;, had fever blister, facial pain and vertigo. Approximately 3.5 weeks after being vaccinated the patient experienced pressure choking and difficulty swallowing. A throat (ENT) specialist was unable to diagnose and they felt there was some autoimmune effects. A month after being vaccinated the patient experienced stomach burning sensation, night sweats and tooth pain. Given the close temporal relationship and the nature of the events, the events of sinus inflammation, sensation of pressure in ear, injection site lump, chills, felt ill, injection site pain and fatigue are considered related to the vaccination. The insufficient information precludes a meaningful medical assessment of the remaining events, including &#34;autoimmune effects&#34;. The events will be assessed further when additional information is received.

I had a weird sensation in my nerves in my right arm and a little all over my body. I think the shot may have hit a nerve in my arm. Two weeks after the shot I was very pale, and my stomach was very upset. I had a headache and abdominal pain. I felt very ill so I didn&#39;t eat or drink much that day.  The smell of food made me throw up and felt really bad for 24 hours. I did not eat much for three days and it helped my nausea and I recovered after four days I still had the unusual feeling all over my body. I got some IV therapy twice and it helped. It did start to fade over time and I finally started to feel normal after a month. I am fully recovered now.

Lasted for 36 hours approx. 2) Approx ten days later on April 19th, 2021, I awoke at night with severe left shoulder pain/deep ache. It came and went over the next week, but became more constant and severe. I couldn&#39;t sleep most nights without sleep meds, and even then it was for a few hours, and on my back. I couldn&#39;t sleep on either the good and especially not the bad shoulder.  Via a phone call, my PCP suggested I begin treatment with Ibuprofen, 3-4 times per day. I took 2-3 Ibuprofen at a time. As of today, May 12, 2021, I am still taking Ibuprofen 3 times a day as I still cannot sleep on my bad (left) side. I didn&#39;t think this was related to the vaccine shot until my husband said that he also was having shoulder pain on the same side as the injection. His was milder and lasted about a week, but began about the same time as mine did.

                                                During a conversation, I was told I began smacking my lips then proceeded to completely ?zoneout? for  5-7 minutes. My arm was touched and I was asked a couple of questions to which I did not respond. After a few minutes, I became alert and continued conversation where I left off. I was unaware any of this was happening. I was pretty much wiped out for about 5 days. I have never had a seizure before.

I felt a burning all over my body (especially my back), and body aches, and began a fever which grew from 97.3 (my normal) to a high of 100.1  (&#43;2.8 degrees) within 2.5 more hours (by 9:30pm).   Very bad chills and fever.  By 9:30 took 1 500mg Tylenol.   Little sleep that night.  Felt very unwell next day (3/9) including headache.  At noon I could get up and get some food.  By 1pm fever subsided completely, but temporarily.  Fever came back by 4pm, but only to 98.6 (&#43;1.3 above normal).  Took another 500mg Tylenol.  Night 2 slept well. Woke up 3/10 no fever, headache gone, but balance still peculiar.  I noticed the first night that my sense of balance was off.

                                                One week after vaccination, patient awoke with intense generalized itching  (she described as a &#34;internal burning itchiness&#34; that was &#34;all over&#34;).  She saw no rash or hives.  Continued for remainder of night, difficult to sleep.  Next day her husband found what he described as a few &#34;faint, non raised patches of very light hives&#34; on the patient&#39;s back.  She looked more carefully and found a few small similar patches on both arms and legs.  Treated with OTC lotion, CeraVe Itch Relief Lotion from store.  Patient says 12 hours after onset that the &#34;insane burning/ itching has subsided for now.&#34;  Patient reports no new foods, clothing, washing machine detergent, illnesses, or other exposures.  I am a physician, and the patient called me (her brother) to ask me whether this was a known side effect of the Janssen COVID vaccine.  I did not see this described in the FDA advisory committee data package, but just a general reference that urticaria would be an expected side effect to a vaccine.

Slept most of the day and by nightfall had only lasting fatigue, which was still present this morning, 3/13/21. By this afternoon all symptoms had abated.

I couldn&#39;t knit ot fine motor skills, It bothered me. I woke up on Sunday where I had extremes muscle weakness in both my legs. I called my PCP, they were surprised by how the reaction was delayed.  They wanted me to get a test for the strength in my legs and sent me to the ER. I wen to the Er they tested for stroke, blood work, scans, they were worried about Guillain Barre Syndrome.  I stayed there about 5 hours. Yesterday afternoon the tingly went away from my hands but my legs are still kinda goofy. The muscle in my forearm  and thigh feel like my muscle are really sore, like they have been tense

Hives in the crook of my right arm. Burning, itchy little red bumps. I couldn&#39;t swallow but I think that was from the high blood sugar as my mouth was very dry. I felt like I had a really bad cold, my head felt foggy.

The worst of all happened at 3 1/2 days, a rash started in the evening, went to bed, woke up the next day with rash almost everywhere. Red, swollen, &amp; itching like crazy.   The next day- Sunday, along with Monday &amp; Tues. was horrid. I am covered from my scalp to the tops of my feet, my crotch hurts, as do my breasts. Used Benadryl cream, aloe vera to no avail.

                                                Within a few hours of receiving the vaccine, I started feeling nauseated. Since the day I took the vaccine, my appetite has been nonexistent. A day later, I felt very tired and confused. I received the vaccine on Monday and I woke up in a panic on Wednesday morning. My heart was racing, palms were sweaty, I felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe and it seemed like I was having a panic attack when I woke up. From that point forward, I fell into a deep depression. At first I didn&#39;t connect it with the vaccine, but I kept feeling nauseated and then wondered if it was connected. The depression became unbearable and I felt suicidal by the next week. I finally contacted my doctor&#39;s office and had a telemed visit where I explained that I had the J&amp;J vaccine the week before and these symptoms presented themselves afterward. The doctor put me on Zoloft and I HAVE been treated for depression in years past with that; however, I had not taken depression medication for about 8-10 years until this. Likewise, because my doctor put me on an anti-depressant, she also wanted me to see a counselor--which I have done. The medication is helping somewhat but I still don&#39;t have an appetite. I don&#39;t know if the vaccine had anything to do with the depression, but I wanted to report it just in case others have had similar symptoms.

Don&#39;t remember reactions to previous vaccines but not surprised considering allergies. Left side of face felt strange but didn&#39;t look any different when a selfie was taken. Sometime during the afternoon/evening, experienced a headache of short duration. Approximately six hours after shot, experienced chills and low grade fever. Simply went to sleep. Better the following morning, though very tired.  Probably unelated rough itchy patch on RIGHT arm the day following vaccine. Went away with no treatment.

At 5:30pm, same day, became immediate flush, dizzy, barely made it to bathroom, violently vomiting all that was in my stomach.  This was followed by severe chills, the shakes and a mild headache.  Took (2) Tylenol at the time of the shot, drank many ounces of water all day but still had this issue. Took another (2) Tylenol after vomiting and more water. Went to bed at 8pm.  Woke at midnight, 4/5/21, severe headache, now took (2) Advil and slept better until Mon. Morning, 4/5/2021.  Experienced two sluggish, low energy days and still have no appetite. What the heck????

Immediately had to lay down and took Advil/Tylenol.  Could feel the movement of joint pain from shoulders to elbow, hips to knees.  Headache.  Couldn&#39;t navigate stairs safely.   In bed or on the couch for 24 hours until 6pm Friday 4/9/2021.      Three of us from the same company had the Janssen Vac within a day of each other and all 3 of us had the same adverse reaction.  To me, that is not mild symptoms when it debilitated me and kept me from going to work.    Most family members have had Pfizer with two shots and had NO side effects.

                                                I wasn&#39;t sure how to indicate which dose I&#39;m reporting on.  It&#39;s my second dose of a vaccine but my first of Johnson &amp; Johnson.  My first shot for Covid-19 was a Moderna shot, to which I had a bad reaction (immediate and prolonged lightheadedness reported already on this site).  My doctor advised me that my second dose should be a Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, as per information he had received from the CDC.  So, 28 days after the first shot I had the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.  I experienced the expected side effects of body aches, chills, headache--no big deal on day 2, but on day 3, I started some lightheadedness, as did my daughter who had the shot the same day.  Her lightheaded subsided the next day, but mine continued into day 4 and got worse when it became accompanied by pressure in my head/ears, and it felt like I was talking in a tunnel with echoing.  I couldn&#39;t function the rest of the day.  Today, the head pressure is not there, but the lightheadedness and shakiness are still there.  I hope I fully recover from these shots, but I don&#39;t have a lot of hope.

Pain continued throughout the night, until I finally got up and just walked around house to try to get some relief then laid down and try elevating leg on pillows. The pain continued so got u p and walked around more and pain finally subsided enough to get some rest.  Then felt like just had a bruise in that area of the leg for a day.

Over the next couple of days, became very ill, spent five days experiencing severe headache, disorientation, confusion, neck, shoulder, and back pain together with generalized arthralgias and myalgias. Around the 2nd week post-vaccination began to experience ?numbness and tingling? initially, affecting all fingers and toes; symptoms gradually evolved into ascending paresthesia affecting the upper and lower extremities. (worse in the upper extremities). Neurological symptoms are accompanied by painful electrical-like impulses running along my spine and elicited by flexing my neck (Lhermitte neurological phenomenon). Neurological signs and symptoms prompted me to go to the emergency room. Currently, I am under the care of a neurologist and undergoing extensive diagnostic workup.  Present treatment: Glucocorticoids (tapering) and Gabapentin. Among the initial rule out diagnosis, were transverse myelitis, and Guillain Barre. Present preliminary r/o diagnosis: Post-vaccine immune reaction ? No definitive diagnosis yet.

                                                Exactly a week after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine, I was out on my morning walk when my head became very fuzzy and my vision was altered (seeing jagged zigzags-fuzzy ones with my left eye).  The vision issue persisted when I closed my eyes.  The fuzzy head issue continued during a very difficult walk home and when I arrived and things didn&#39;t clear, my husband ended up taking me to the emergency room.  I got in quickly because the symptoms I described sounded to them like a stroke.  But, I didn&#39;t have a stroke.  They did a CT scan.  It was fine.  The vision thing they thought sounded like the effect of a migraine.  But, I&#39;ve never experienced migraines.  (Note: this incident occurred the day before the news of the J&amp;J blood clots became public).  Anyway, after a couple of hours in the emergency room, I was fine and went home.  So, I don&#39;t know what happened and it probably didn&#39;t have anything to do with the vaccine.  I&#39;m not prone to being alarmist and I would only consent to go to the emergency room if I thought I were in a serious situation.  The blood work indicated my platelets were in the normal range.  And, I&#39;m too old to be in the category of the six women who experienced blood clots.  However, I just thought I should report this in case anyone else experiences something similar.

                                                A little over a week after the vaccine I begin feeling so tired because my back started feeling  so weard and fatigued feeling.  It was like my back was tired and the muscles were really tensed.   Moving helped but while sitting is when the issue back hurt worse.  I reached out to your Chiropractor on 3/31 who performed a few settings on my back to help with the tension but the pain went up and down during that time and seems as if the pain went away on it on.

I waited until 8:00 AM that Urgent Care opened,  My husband drove me to Urgent Care at 8:00, got medicine for stopping dizziness. I slept almost for two days.  On 4/26, my dizziness started again.  I went to my family doctor and ENT.  Since I still have very light dizziness.  It has been for a month.

                                                I had oral surgery four days before the vaccine with laughing gas and Novocain which lasted four hours. The morning after the vaccine I felt lightheaded and weird. I had heart palpitations and I was queasy. I started to walk back to my bedroom. The next thing I knew I woke up on the floor after passing out. After that I felt like my body was crumpled and I was disoriented. I could barely walk but I made it to the couch, and I had bumps in the front and back of my head near my ear. I was in a lot of pain and I think I was in shock. My foot was painful, and I saw a foot doctor. I had a doctor?s appointment and they did an EKG and they sent me to a Neurologist. It has been seven weeks I still have dizziness and nausea and it is hard to focus. I also have pain in my knee and my right arm.

                                                I received the vaccine on March 13, 2021. I did not have an immediate reaction, but began breaking out in hives all over my body 24 hours later. I was lethargic, wanted to sleep all the time, and had no energy. This is gradually getting better, but still occurs. I periodically have headaches. After two full months I continue to have regular eruptions of hives on my arms. Prior to taking the vaccine I had no health issues, ran daily,  and worked out regularly. I have just recently started walking, but have not been able to run.

Woke up an hour later (9PM) with fever (100.5), HUGE migraine and being nauseous. I threw up, tried to go back to sleep but couldn&#39;t because of the migraine and fever. Decided to take 2 Tylenol, but I vomited about 20 mins later.  All night, I hardly could sleep at all, so sick I was feeling (and I&#39;m never sick!). No reaction at all on the site of the vaccine, no redness, no swelling at all. All day today (day after the vaccine), I have felt really weak, slightly feverish (though less than last night), with a persistent headache.

                                                Approximately two weeks following her vaccine, my mother suffered from a bout of transient global amnesia, as eventually diagnosed by her family doctor. All of a sudden one evening, she lost any and all orientation to time. My father and I rushed her to the hospital for fear she was suffering from a stroke. She could not remember what day it was, what she had done that day, conversations we had the day before and she kept repeating herself in 3-minute loops. About 6 hours after the initial onset and while still in the ER,  she regained all orientation however she does not remember what happened to her or what she did or said during this period of time.

Other symptoms receding, except headache. Took 2 aspirin at noon. Still have minor headache. Yuck!

                                                At the time, I had very mild injection site pain and warmth on the site. For a couple of days. On Monday, the 15th, I had the worst flare-up of sciatica that I have ever had in my life. Left leg - it had a tremendous swelling. It was crippling. I am still using a pain. I cried because the pain was so horrific. I was able to get into the doctor early on Tuesday - prescribed Prednisone; hydrocodone; muscle relaxer. None of which touched the pain. I was unable to sleep for three days. I slept upright in a chair. I used an office chair as a wheel chair. I wasn&#39;t able to lay down. I&#39;ve improved but I still can&#39;t walk to the mailbox - could walk down there - two houses down but couldn&#39;t get back. I am using a cane still. I have to elevate leg on a recliner to sleep so it will help with the continued swelling. There was nothing I did that triggered it.

                                                About 4 and a half weeks after getting the J&amp;J vaccine, I began to experience marked symptoms: dizziness and disorientation,, balance problems, bilateral numbness in hands, feet and tip of tongue, awareness of left side of brain, intermittent mild nausea (likely related to dizziness).  These symptoms had a sudden onset. I am normally very healthy and active so these unusual symptoms without any illness were quite a departure from my normal health. They have, to date, persisted continually since onset over the past 3 weeks. They are very concerning. Last night I went to the ER to be seen since I could not get an appt. with a neurologist for several months and I am concerned about my sudden change in health status.

I slept 4 hours past my normal time for getting up. I had no balance and would stagger when standing. My entire body was in muscle and nerve pain. Even my skin hurt. I took 300 mg of Gabapentine which eased my pain. I continued to be off balance the remainder of the day, however, by the end of the day I was much better. I took several 1 hour naps throughout the day.

                                                Right away, they were watching me because I felt like my throat was tightening up a little bit. My blood pressure sky rocketed. Then I was okay after awhile. They pharmacist said to take some Benadryl when I got home if I needed it. He knew I had taken Claritin D earlier. I was okay though. But the next morning, I was so exhausted I could barely get out of bed. The next day, I was still really tired. On Sunday morning, 10th, it hit me - I woke up at 04:00 in am. Nauseous; light-headed; gastro-intestinal issues; extremely ill. I called my brother in and was afraid to be by myself. I could barely move around to even get water or go to bathroom.  I got through it somehow that day and on Monday I was just maybe a little but that isn&#39;t saying much - still severe. By Tuesday, I called the pharmacy - I was so light-headed I thought I was going to pass out and they told me to go to ER and someone took me and doctor said he was seeing a lot of this.  Gave me IV fluids. It was difficult to stay hydrated - they gave me paperwork on what to drink to stay hydrated - Pedialyte - anything that had water in it. I drank Essentia Water, too. I couldn&#39;t stay hydrated and I was so light-headed  (kept feeling like I was going to pass out) that I could have gone to ER again two days later. Doctor said take it easy - he said my body was busy making antibodies. That light-headedness for about a week - but I couldn&#39;t drive for two weeks because of it - was still so dehydrated. I had a strange sensation - like I was outside my body - I couldn&#39;t think straight. I was feeling pain in my back by my kidneys and went to my doctor.

                                                Immediate pain at injection site as expected , as well as fever, headache, chills, fatigue. Towards evening these symptoms worsened. (not adverse).  I hardly slept. (all these not worrisome to me) I&#39;m so glad my vaccine provider warned me that with underlying conditions, the vaccine could make them flare up. Which they did. In the morning I had widespread pain all over. Severe headache, and shortness of breath. Because I already have near emphysema hypoxemia oxygen levels, I checked my Oximeter and my blood oxygen was in the dangerously low 70&#39;s.  It stayed there until I put my oxygen concentrator on. Monitoring oxygen levels all day, I was able to keep it in the 80&#39;s to 90&#39;s, which helped.  40 hrs after injection , symptoms already fading away. All my adverse events were related to underlying conditions responding to the inflammation of the immune response. I feel  protected, glad I had the oxygen handy,  and I feel great about the  J &amp; J vaccine!

                                                The shot was painful but that wasn?t unexpected. I immediately felt woozy after the shot but thankfully I had brought a cold full sugar ginger ale and started drinking it. My sensation was kind of like a low blood sugar event where a soda can help. I was not surprised to feel this way and felt somewhat reluctant to report this as I didn?t really think it was unusual. and I didn?t report  it at the time. The shot was at a drive up event at a University.. After chugging the ginger ale I felt a bit better and was given the  ok to leave after 15 minutes. Back at work, I felt  better but still just a bit  ? off?.  But this passed in an hour and I was good the rest of the day. For a few days afterwards  I had a mild headache but no other real symptoms.  My usual  blood pressure under medications is 116/72.  It could be possible that the shot caused some lower blood pressure immediately or within the hour  after the shot?  Or perhaps the effect was low blood sugar for which the ginger ale helped.

                                                About three hours after the vaccination, after eating a light dinner of two pieces of pizza and drinking a beer (to celebrate,  I thought) (an identical dinner to my husband, who was vaccinated minutes after me, and who suffered no adverse effects) I suddenly had extreme nausea and, immediately, projectile vomiting. My entire stomach emptied, but I continued to retch for the entire night and into the next day, weak and nauseated for about 72 hours. I became dehydrated but couldn&#39;t keep water down for 48 hours.   That first night, I experienced body temperature swings, whole body pain (not muscle aches, and not localized) and most disturbingly, hallucinations.  I awoke in the middle of the night convinced that my body had stretched in length  and there were two of me.  This was similar to the reaction I had to opiodes, but even worse (I didn&#39;t think anything could be worse).

                                                Right after I got it I had a metal taste in my mouth. About 45 minutes later I started seeing little light like Christmas lights, it lasted for about a half hour.  The next morning I woke up, I felt like I got hit by a truck, I felt so bad, no chest and body hurt. I got up and did a breathing treatment. I went to the Dr. because it sacred me, she gave me antibiotics , cough medicine with codeine- I couldn&#39;t stop coughing.  I asked her to change my nebulizer treatment because it wasn&#39;t working.  The Dr. suspected that this would happen.

                                                On day 11 post shot I started to feel mildly nauseated. Next day nausea increased, as did muscle aches and pain - by early evening I had repeated bouts of uncontrollable vomiting and uncontrollable diarrhea [no cramps, no warning] that lasted most of the night.  I did have a fever briefly - got all red and felt like I was on fire - but that passed pretty quickly while the rest continued.   I had to stay up all night, any attempt to lie down triggered more vomiting.  By 3 in the morning I was ?on empty? and by 6 am could lie down.  Nausea took three more days to leave completely.  Muscle pain is resolving, almost gone.  I am resuming my meds [everything that went down before came right back up].  The only tummy pain was after hours of vomiting [muscle strain].   Today is the 25th and I?m still tired and a bit foggy but otherwise feel better.  I had a call with my doctor about this and she said I should report it so that?s what I?m doing.

                                                Prior to vaccination, the patient stated that she was nervous, but seemed relieved and okay directly following the vaccination.  Following vaccination, patient became restless during the 15 minute post-vaccination window about 2-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  She initially presented with uncontrollable shaking/bouncing legs, palpitation, sweating, and shortness of breath (though this was very brief.   Patient remained coherent and oriented to time/person/place.   The shaking and palpitations subsided after a couple minutes and resumed towards the end of the 15 minute waiting period, accompanied by nausea.  25 minutes post-vaccination she appeared to have stabilized, and we assisted the patient to her room nearby at her request to allow her to lie down while being monitored.  After returning to her room, she very quickly ran to her sink due to her nausea, then after a minute of attempting to vomit, she collapsed and appeared to have briefly lost consciousness.  EMS was called and the patient was rolled onto her side to prevent choking in the event of emesis.  Patient remained responsive, but was weak and clammy with a weak pulse and breathing.  After the firefighters came, a search of the apartment found the previously listed medications.  Additionally, the patient experienced a seizure-like episode lasting 15 seconds in duration.  Once the EMT came, they assessed her and monitored her in the ambulance; they reported that her condition appeared stable, her vitals were strong, and transported her to Hospital for observation/testing.

My heart rate stayed at 109 or more until 10 PM the next night when its slowly went down to a normal heart rate.  At 3 am  (12 hours after the shot) i had  a blinding debilitating headache that lasted until 9pm the next night.   It also affected my vision.   The headache was so bad i could not concentrate on the simplest task.  I  was unsure of what i could take for the headache.   So, I did not take anything.    When i woke up i was very tired and this lasted until the following day.  6am i had a fever of 102.3 this went down to 100.4 at 9:15 pm that night.  I also had chills for several hours. 9:20 AM  the nausea started followed by vomiting and dizziness.   This only lasted for a few hours.    I  experienced very vivid dreams the night of the shot.    I only drank some coconut water all day and could not eat any food.  The next day Saturday March 27 i felt better but the fatigue did not go away until late in the evening.   Sleeping seemed to help but i could only sleep for 2- 3 hours at the most.

                                                Dizziness, light-headed, nausea, sweating, pale skin.  The patient was observed and given water and orange juice for 25-30 minutes. She felt well enough to leave the pharmacy on her own after 25-30 minutes.  The  patient had a prior history of anxiety prior to receiving vaccinations and was very nervous about getting the vaccination prior to administration.  The patients daughter was with her and felt that her symptoms were due to anxiety about  getting vaccinated, but later called the pharmacy asking to report the adverse events as being related to receiving the vaccine.  It is not known weather or not the symptoms are directly related to the vaccine.

Stayed in bed most of the day on Saturday and went to bed early on Saturday. Woke up Sunday completely soaked from head to tail. I have never broke a sweat like that before. Felt a bit better, but still not great all day Sunday. Monday I got up and felt better. Had lots of things to do and when I returned home I mowed the lawn. It totally wiped me out, which it never does. I was sweating bullets and extremely thirsty. Today I feel better.

Symptoms increased on 3rd day&#39;s evening post-vaccine.  Pronounced hypersomnia, with up to 16 hours sleep and periods of rest/sitting in between, which lasted up to 12 days.  Fatigue above my normal level continues, but not now as severe, and sleep back to close to normal (about 10 hours).  Severe headache with marked dizziness for first 3-5 days, with these symptoms continuing at rather low level off and on now.  Elevated body temperature around 3-4am at night for first 3-4 days, with vivid dreams.  About 80% recovered.

This is likely a mast cell activation flare, but I am reporting it as an adverse reaction just in case). People with MCAD receive no information about potential flares, whether one dose vaccines are safer, the excipients in the injection (which can cause flares), etc. There are enough of us that you may want to track this.

                                                Approximately an hour after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine, I noticed a loud constant ringing in my ears (tinnitus) which has continued. I still heard the ringing in my ears on April 8.  The ringing was so loud on April 9, that it woke me up during my sleep. The morning of Saturday, April 10, I called insurance company Advice Nurse and was advised to go to an Urgent Care to discuss my symptoms. with a doctor who checked my ears and blood pressure--both look normal. He also recommended going to an ENT, for which I have set up a future appointment. Last night, I slept better, but still hear the ringing in my ears this morning. I am very concerned about this ongoing side-effect.

                                                Johnson and Johnson Janssen COVID-19 EUA vaccine  At the time of the injection, the vaccine burned as it entered my arm. (I have never felt that burning sensation with any other vaccination that I have had in the past. Twenty minutes after the vaccination, I became lightheaded and dizzy.  I could walk but I was wobbly. At one hour after the vaccination, I felt a sharp stabbing pain in the left side of my tongue and then the left side and only the left side of my tongue began to go numb. Within a couple of minutes, I realized that my left jaw was going numb, too.  The numbness slowly but surely began to move up the left side of my face all the way to the top of my head.  I had a sharp but brief headache on the left side of my head  that subsided quickly but the numbness remained.  I went home and talked to two people on the phone for several hours because they wanted to be sure that I was OK. At two hours after the vaccination, my face was still numb but I could think and talk clearly, but I was clearing my throat and coughing a lot.  At that point, I also realized that my whole left arm was a little numb and my fingers on my left hand were tingling.  That numbness lasted about 20 minutes and then subsided. The facial numbness lasted for hours.  I wasn&#39;t scared and I wasn&#39;t in pain but it was very strange.  It felt a little bit like the after affects of dental anesthesia but it wasn&#39;t just in my mouth it was the whole left side of my face.   I believe that this must have been an allergic reaction to one of the chemicals in the vaccine but I don&#39;t know which one.  If you can tell me which chemical it might have been, I will avoid it in the future.

I woke my husband and asked him to take my temperature - I had no fever.  I then asked him to call 911 to ask if my symptom was typical of the vaccine.  They sent paramedics to my house and before they arrived I started feeling better so there was no treatment performed.  The whole bad episode lasted 10-15 minutes and I felt like I was going to die.  It was not repeated.

No concomitant medications were reported.  On 06-MAR-2021, the patient experienced hallucination, headache, muscle aches, flu like symptoms and fatigue.

As per follow-up information received on 16-Mar-2021: Added and updated: The outcome of flu like symptoms was updated to recovering/resolving and narrative.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V.1: The follow up information in this version updates outcome of flu like symptoms. This updated information does not alter the causality of previously reported event .  20210320317- Covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s-Hallucination. This event is considered unassessable. The event has a compatible/suggestive temporal relationship, is unlabeled, and has unknown scientific plausibility. There is no information on any other factors potentially associated with the event.

On 04/06 She passed out while sitting in her chair, woke up and began throwing up. Had extreme short term memory loss and low blood pressure. On 04/08 while at her primary care Dr, he suggested a hospital visit with suspicion of possible stroke.  Was admitted  and released the following day. Dr advised possible mini strokes but could also be dehydration.  CBC with differential showed other results than dehydration.   Starting around 04/20 she started having chest pains and thought it was heart burn, after medication and another visit to her pcp she was admitted to the hospital again on 04/23.  Her troponin levels indicated a possible heart attack.  She had a heart catherization and was found to have a healthy heart.  Again, her blood pressure has been decreased since, her hgb and hct has also been low with a history of it being high.  A high WBC since all of this has started among other unexplained blood results.

                                                Noon the day after the vaccine I was suddenly overcome with nausea, and dizziness that sent me stumbling to bed and vomiting into a bucket next to me. Vomiting lasted for one session, but dizziness and nausea stayed for about 3 hours, and then nausea, fatigue and general sick feeling kept me in bed until the next day. April 9 I woke up still feeling out of sorts, but not as bad. Note: 28 minutes after having the vaccine, once I started driving home, the vision in my left eye suddenly went blurry, and I nearly lost vision in that eye. I tried to find a safe place to pull over but couldn&#39;t. After 5-8 minutes the vision came back but stayed a bit blurry for a couple hours. Never had any such thing happen before.

I woke up (Wed.) with  NAUSEA and took the &#34;anti-nausea&#34; pills that I had left over from when I had COVID (11 - 2020).  My upper arm was now very sore, especially when I tried to lift it.  I took my temp. and I had a FEVER (101). On Thurs., my temp. went down to 99.5 and the nausea was gone.  Today (Fri.), I woke up with pain on my shoulder (over the injection site). I took Advil and iced it and it is now much better (this eve.). The only side effect I have now is the pain in my arm (mostly when I lift it). I am eating better and sleeping better now.

I could not go up and down steps as my legs would not hold me. Headache.  Week 2 to present. Fatigue, I have to nap every day and I sleep 8 hours or more at night.  Diarrhea, despite taking OTC medications  to control. Dehydration and dizziness. I am now 4 weeks since my shot on March 4th and I continue to have these symptoms.   I went to see my doctor and all lab tests are normal. There is no other diagnose reason for my continued symptoms. I wish I waited to get either the Pfizer shot or Moderna as I have not heard of these extreme and prolonged side effects from those shots.

No other expected side effects, just a slight 30 second wave of nausea 20 minutes after shot, and again the next day with a feeling of being a bit &#34;off&#34; for a day or two. Only the taste decrease seems to be ongoing and unexpected.

I spit up yellow phlegm, tiredness behind eyes returned, sneezing, choking on phlegm, and constant runny nose and ringing in ears.  This has made working difficult, but not impossible.

After that time she has noticed a worsening of the fatigue and &#39;tiredness&#39; to the point that she can no longer perform normal activities.  She states that she is normally very active and enjoys activities like cutting the grass and other outdoor chores.  But for the last 10 days or so she has been unable to do those things and finds herself falling back asleep during the day.  She says this overwhelming feeling of tiredness seems to be getting worse.  I suggested she visit her doctor for bloodwork and she said she would do so.

By 11:00 that same night I felt nauseous, has a headache and every joint and muscle  in my body was painful.  I could not sleep or get into a position where I was comfortable.   The pain level was a 10.   I took Tylenol in the middle of the night but it did not help.  In the morning I was unable to contact my physician&#39;s nurse so I called the 24 hour Nurse Line.  The nurse took all my information and told me that I could take Ibuprofen.  I took 400 mg. and found a lot of relief from that.  I still had some symptoms for the next few days.  By 3/14/21 I felt fine.  Now today I have a stuffy nose which could be an allergy to something else.  I don&#39;t know yet.

                                                Presented to the ED  for evaluation of hallucinations. Received the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID vaccine on 3/8. She had been feeling fine following it, until early this morning. She awoke and went to the bathroom when she noticed a &#34;paisley pattern&#34; that was &#34;all over everything&#34;, noting that it was even present when her eyes were closed. While she was in the bathroom, the pattern began to move, causing her to feel nauseated and eventually vomit. She has never had a similar episode to this.   All of her symptoms completely resolved after droperidol. Observed in the ED and was ambulating independently and returned to her baseline.  She had no recurrence of any of her symptoms. She was comfortable going home and discharged with her sister.

Can&#39;t sleep due to EXTREMELY loud ringing in both ears.  Difficulty performing everyday tasks.  I know of no other adverse event that occurred at this time other than vaccination.  Visited primary care physician on April 8, 2021.  She could not say for certain why I have these sudden ear symptoms.  She wants me to monitor for 2-3 weeks.

At the same time it felt like my head (in notch immediately forward of middle of ear to ear)  was in a tightening vise.  Then I got hot and cold  but not severely.  Same for dizziness, very mild. I was nasusseous and not able to eat.  I had random muscles pains , none lasting more than a few minutes in any one place. Odd thing was that I felt no discomfort at sight of injection. Next day I felt just as bad but at 8:30pm I felt like throwing up (after having 2 teaspons of vegetarian vegetable soup). However, I only had dry heaves. I live by myself and started to get scared. I called my daughter and took a Tylenol at 9pm. Within 10 minutes the feeling of a vise and my aching teeth felt significantly better. but  stil very fatigued. Next day, today,  I feel much better but still a little foggy headed. I can eat. I can function normally, thank heavens. If I had to take another shot now, I wouldn&#39;t. Not even sure I&#39;ll take a booster when it comes out . It was very scarey.

                                                Right arm had a large red and warm area where shot was given with itching.  About ten days after shot this all began.  There is a knot about the size of a large walnut at the injection site.  This has been there since about 10 days after shot was given and it is still somewhat tender in spots and it feels like a bruise.  I cannot lie on my right side comfortably.  I have not had any serious pain with this reaction and can lift my arm without discomfort.

                                                Sore arm right away and then went to a sore muscle like normal the next day and was sore for three days. What happened next, I had gone to ENT for my ear (5th) and he put me on heavy dose of Prednisone (6th). Following Tuesday, I was on Prednisone for ear. I was already really achy by then. On the third day after the Prednisone I fatigue, headaches and neck pain but I didn&#39;t have any other pain. I still couldn&#39;t hear though.  I was on this for almost 4 weeks and from them I started like I was having a hot flash and then I would get cold; sore throat; headaches heavy bones and achy muscles; earaches; fatigue; dizziness like you wouldn&#39;t believe. They were cyclical - I&#39;d have them for a couple days and then for about a half a day I&#39;d be a bit better and then it would start up again. The fatigues and dizziness didn&#39;t change when the other symptoms seemed to be a bit better. My hearing didn&#39;t start to clear until I went to see the 2nd ENT which was a couple of weeks down the road. I do not have the stamina I had before the vaccine - I&#39;m not sleeping well at night and I&#39;m always short of breath at any exertion. It is improving but it&#39;s slow. Again, the symptoms I experienced during cyclical times: Cold symptoms, runny nose, sore mouth, ringing in my ears was horrible; dizziness and short of breath - cyclical for three weeks. The Prednisone took away all my cramps and pain in my joints that I had before the vaccine. Currently: My heart feels like it&#39;s going 100 miles an hour at night in bed - chest discomfort at night. Legs blue in the shower. The week of the 28th, I was done with the Prednisone and then all the pain came back and more. I can&#39;t take an inflammatory - the pain is still there and my usual cramps came back.
