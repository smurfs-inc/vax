                                                Hi, I received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine one week ago, Thurs March 11. On friday, I experienced the typical flu like symptoms - chills aches pains and fever. These have slowly gone away, but a week later I still have chills and constantly shake, and diarrhea. The most significant side effect I want to report is extreme vertigo and dizziness and headaches. These have been present for a week now and have prevented me from working and doing daily activities. I constantly feel like Im going to fall over and cannot see clearly. I previously had vestibular migraines, but these have been mostly gone due to going to the chiropractor and taking my supplements. The vaccine brought them back now in full force. I read that this is becoming a commonality among other people and need answers on this. I want to make sure its not permanent or that I will have this as a serious side effect.

I also was experiencing a heavy chest and shortness of breath. All but one of the adverse events went away after 24-36 hours - the shortness of breath and shallow breathing have persisted up through today. I am very aware of my breathing and how my chest feels tight, like I&#39;m not getting enough air.

About 5 pm, I started to feel really cold and my whole body was shivering and vibrating. My whole body also started to ache and my bones felt heavy. At about 10 pm I started to get really high fever and felt so cold. I could not sleep even with a winter jacket on, I had a really bad headache in the center of my forehead, lower back pain and felt extremely sore and weak. I found it difficult to stand or walk. I woke up at 2:30 am from bed, to get a snack and took 2 ibuprofen to ease the symptoms. Woke up at about 10 am next day, felt slightly better. Fever has gone down slightly but not completely. Still feeling really cold and shivering.

                                                Patient was administered vaccine and told to wait the 15 minute monitoring period. After about 4 minutes, I heard her say &#34;I&#39;m not feeling right.&#34; I went to where she was sitting and asked &#34;are you ok?&#34; and had her take some slow, deep breaths. I then saw her eyes roll back and she lost consciousness. Thankfully, I was there and grabbed her as she toppled from the chair. I told the staff to call 911 and supported her neck and body in the chair. I could tell she was breathing and she was sweating profusely. I held her and spoke to her, and after about 15 seconds, she began to come out of it. After about a minute she was alert and orientated again.  I had her slowly sip a little water. The EMTs arrived in about 5 minutes and the assessed her vitals. She indicated that this was the first time anything like this had happened to her. They advised that since she had fainted, she should go to the hospital for observation, but she declined, stated that she felt fine at that point. Since she was driving, I insisted that she remain another one-half hour before leaving. During that time she drank more water and alternately sat and walked around the pharmacy. She did indicate that she had drank a protein shake that morning, but not eaten. I advised her to in the future, tell her doctor and/or any immunizer about the event. She left, stating that she was feeling fine, and I called her several hours later to make sure that she had indeed gotten home ok. She again said that she felt fine.

                                                I started to lose mobility in my left arm the evening of my vaccine appointment. The following morning, I could not raise my arm at all. The pain in my upper left arm (where the vaccine was administered) has been severe for more than 48 hours. It is extremely painful to the touch. I can use my left hand, but cannot function/cannot perform necessary daily work and school tasks due to the loss of mobility. I have been in extreme pain and fear my shoulder has been injured.

                                                Experienced light headedness ( started before time stated but not sure when exactly). Around 6:30pm-7pm I began feeling dizzy, going between dizzy and light headed. I was drinking plenty fluids and did eat. A few people noted that I looked very out of it, and I felt very out of it. I tried staying seated and this did not have any effect on the dizzy feeling. I went to lay down and before going to sleep around 10pm-11pm, laying in bed I felt like the room was spinning. I also had typical symptoms, soreness as injections site and arm (starting immediately the day of vaccine), fever at it&#39;s highest was 102 (starting at 100.5 that morning, not peaking until Motrin wore off*see below*), feeling tired and very heavy.. like everywhere was waited down by something (starting early in the morning).  I was given Motrin by my coworker in the morning as I was had a headache  and was feeling sore and moving sore due to heavy feeling. Wednesday waking up the dizziness  and lightheadedness were gone. A slight feeling of being out of it however, fever was about 99-100 throughout the day (99 being my typical temp). As of today only a feeling of sore arm and tiredness which sometimes feels like I and out of it but I feel both from later yesterday and today is due to the tired feeling that comes common.

I then began to feel nauseous again and get extreme chills. I vomited multiple times, and was curled up in a fetal position crying from the nausea, headache, and a feeling of pressure in my chest. I ended up going to bed to sleep it off, waking up in a pool of sweat. I felt better the next day.

Inexplicable fear of being paralyzed and dying ( somewhat delirious overnight)- inability to sleep the evening after the shot.  The full day after the vaccination, body temperature rose--couldn&#39;t stop sweating and had a searing headache. Took tylenol to reduce the symptoms.   The following day (today) had severe dry mouth and very sore throat. Felt about 60% back to normal health. I am a very fit 26 year old (run and exercise daily)

I also experienced an intense stomach pain that came and went that would make it difficult to move without severe pain. I felt extremely disoriented and confused and had a strong headache throughout the intense period of symptoms. Around 7 AM on April 9th the next day, the symptom&#39;s severity decreased and I experienced all of the symptoms mildly along with drowsiness. On april 10th I did not experience any stomach pain, body aches, or chills but, still experienced drowsiness, intermittent headaches and a mild fever. On april 11th, drowsiness  and a headache continued. Today, april 12th, I am still experiencing a mild headache and slight drowsiness.

                                                Within 2 hours of getting the vaccine, I developed a severe migraine, fever(100.1-100.4), chills, dizziness, extreme body aches, nausea and was very weak. Once the bulk of the symptoms subsided, a little under 48 hours after the vaccine was administered, I was able to resume to my daily life. I still have a lingering migraine, arm pain, body aches and a low grade fever of 99.9 now almost 72 hours later, but it is bearable unlike the immediate 48 hours following the vaccine. Over-the-counter medications usually take the edge off of my migraines, though they didn?t even come close to helping the one I currently have. I have been rotating Tylenol and ibuprofen since developing the side effects.

As of today (4/12/2021) I am still feeling extremely anxious (as if my anxiety medicine is not working at all) and have headaches and trouble focusing or remembering things, making it very difficult to work. Also having trouble sleeping because of the anxious feeling.

It started with my body freezing and then I started shaking because I felt so cold and I covered up in blankets and a heating pad and still felt extremely cold. Then, the body aches began, and my whole body was very tired. After an hour of sleep, I took my temperature and it was 100.8. That is the highest that it rose to. My normal body temperature is 97.4. This lasted all through the night up until Saturday afternoon around 3:30 PM on 4/10/21.

Went for a light walk in the morning. Completely lost vision in both eyes extremely blurry. Stumbled my way home running into trees, cars. Vision came back, thought it was migraine (had them before but nowhere NEAR as bad, never had vision completely blocked)  Excurtating headache behind eyes and nausea, feels like pressure in head. Worst headache of my life, went to ER. Gave morphine (did not help pain at all which was horrifying) got a head CT scan which came out clear and discharged because clotting ruled out. It is now day 6 and my headache is persistent and still excruciatingly painful. I?m also extremely nauseous. I?m terrified because I know something is very wrong. ER doc said might be lingering side effect from vaccine but those effects felt very different.

I woke up at around 11:00pm and felt extremely feverish (shivering, entire body extremely soar. My joints hurt so badly that I couldn?t get comfortable) and nauseous. I then had 4 or 5 episodes of violent vomiting throughout the night every 2 or so hours.  After, I would be drenched in sweat.  When I got up *crawled to trash can next to my bed* at around 2:30/3:00AM I took 200mg ibprofin. Felt fatigued and no appetite the next day then was fine

I had a severe fever, chills, headache, muscle spasms in my neck, and whole body aches. This was over the course of 7 hours where I woke up every couple of minutes and thought I was dying. I feel better now though.

                                                The side effects began the night following my vaccine and lasted the entire next day. It began with fatigue/brain fog, then chills and soreness at the injection site. Once the chills began I was very ill with a fever (100-101), severe aches and pains in my body from head to toe, and experienced  occasional shooting pains. Once the fever went away about 30 hours after my vaccine, I still felt pain and heaviness in my body and had a bad headache. The next day (day 3) was much better- I had no fever but still felt some brain fog, drowsiness, and slight muscle soreness (but no pain).   Two weeks after my vaccine (4/20/21)  I had a very similar experience but am not certain it was related to the vaccine. I developed chills, fatigue, and a headache for the majority of the day. In the evening, it progressed to muscle/joint pain, a severe headache, extreme fatigue, and a 100 degree fever. The next day (today 4/21), the fever has subsided and I feel slightly fatigued. Though I am not sure this was related to the vaccine, it mirrored my initial reaction to the vaccine two weeks prior. It is very unusual for me to get a fever in the 100 degree range and typically only happens every two years or so.

The fever and chills lasted through the next day - body ache and soreness throughout both of those days. For those two days I did not work. (Ended the 8th when it was time for me to go to bed.) I did have heart palpitations the night of the 9th that I did go get ER  -they gave me a dose of Ativan and they sent me home. That took care of the heart palpitation symptoms.  I followed up with my provider the following week.

                                                I woke up at 3 am Friday with cold sweats and body aches. Took 1000 mg Tylenol. Woke up again at 10:30 am to a fever still and this odd extremity feeling. Felt like I had a compression body suit on and weight of 50 pounds around my arms and legs, Mild shortness of breath. I felt like I was swollen but did not see any. I called my PCP and vaccine line and both nurses said go to the ER. I went to the ER they ran tests. The time of the ER I started getting leg cramping and spasming. Those symptoms continued to the weekend. On Sunday the weight and swelling feeling went away. I still had bad muscle cramping and swelling. I did telehealth on Tuesday with PCP and was given muscle relaxer which helped some throughout the rest of the week. Thursday night I have a temp pf 99.6 and went up to 100.6 on Friday morning. On Friday I became shortness of breath and fatigued. It became difficult to go up and down stairs or walking about 20 ft without difficulty breathing. I now have a lower right leg muscle twitch/spasm that comes and goes. I switched to a different PCP, he ran more blood work on Wednesday 4/21. And discussed the next steps for treatment and monitoring.

                                                At 3 am the night of the vaccine, I woke up with flu like symptoms, including a headache and shortness of breath. Two days later, I had a severe manic episode that lasted for three days (bipolar was well managed with medication at this point and I had not had a manic episode in months). Along with the manic episode, I developed chest pressure and shortness of breath, along with dizziness and a pounding sensation in my chest.  Any physical activity or even a sip of coffee sets my heart off. I am still experiencing these symptoms to this day and caused me to lose my job because I am not able to perform the required tasks. I had a premature atrial contraction prior to the COVID vaccine, but it had cleared up and I had been off of the medication for months with no problems.  I have been to the doctor&#39;s office (primary care physician-4/15/21 and 4/20/21) twice, the emergency room once (4/26/21), urgent care (4/14/21), and now am seeing a cardiologist for this condition (first visit 4/29/21).

Then a week later, I got a horrible rash all of my body, worse at my hands and feet. The rash included many blisters. Loss of appetite and cannot sleep. I still have the rash now, and it is even getting worse in some parts, while other parts are better due to a steroid cream prescribed by my dermatologist.  On April 26, I felt very dizzy and weak and went to urgent care. I have since recovered from those symptoms.

The pharmacist/doctors at CVS gave me some water and told me to elevate ny legs. After 10 minutes they checked my termperature and blood pressure. I stabized somewhat and when home. I was sure it it was my nerves but something did feel right. I had a slight burning in my chest and felt queezy on/off throughout the day. Chills and hot flashes followed. I was anxious and paranoid about the possibility something serious coukd be wrong with me. I felt shooting pains in my lower left abdomen that nught and the next day. The following day I still felt very weak. My arm hurt. My muscles felt like jello and I?m unhappy. I wish I never got the shot and I?m worried about my body?s reaction to it.

                                                On 3/10/2021 at approximately 2035, a female patient notified vaccine observation staff that she was feeling light headed, queasy and anxious. As staff began to assess the patient she began to pass out loosing consciousness. Staff were able to hold patient before any falls and lower her to the floor. The paramedic on scene began her emergency assessment of the patient. Staff paramedic was able to arouse the patient with a sternal rub. The patient was not fully aware of the event that had occurred. The paramedic place the patient on oxygen via nasal cannula. The patient?s level of consciousness began to improve. The patient stated she has a history of syncopal episode after any immunizations. The patient also relayed that she has a history of anxiety and is complaint with her medication. After secondary assessment of the patient, it was noted that the patient had an extended recovery time from the sycopal episode. She was unable to stand on her own and she still felt nauseous after vomiting. The staff at the clinic notified county EMS at 2055 and care of the patient was transferred.

I woke up at 11:55p (8 hours post vaccine, two hours after falling asleep) due to full body chills and shaking. I took two Tylenol. This lasted about 45 minutes. I felt cold but didn?t have a fever.  I kept waking up throughout the night clammy.  I woke up at 5:30a (30 mins earlier than normal) because I couldn?t sleep and had a headache.  I felt sore and achy and very fatigued all day. I took the afternoon off work and came home and slept 3 hours. Still felt groggy and sore after. Felt more normal the next morning. My left arm is still sore two days post vaccination.

I had to go home from work due to these feelings. Eventually, developed into a fever. I went home and the chills and aches worsened. I could not get warm not matter how many layers or blankets I had. I took tylenol and fell asleep after several hours. When I woke up, I was profusely sweaty, my fever  broke. I was able to eat a small lunch and continued to lie down the whole day. My symptoms lessened and were more minimal 24 hours after. After going to sleep the second night, I felt back to normal upon wake up.

                                                Fever started at around 4:30 am the morning after receiving the vaccine. The chills woke me up, so I took Tylenol 1000 mg and my fever broke about an hour later. I had to keep taking Tylenol 1000 mg at 10:30 am and 4:30 pm to control my fever. Each dose worked well for the first 3 hours or so on the fever, but then it would come back. I also had muscle and headaches and fatigue, which made it very difficult to move around. The Tylenol also helped with that somewhat, but I spent most of the day in bed and on the couch (and I am normally very active). By around 5:30-6pm, the symptoms were fading slowly. I felt a lot less achy and my body temperature felt closer to regular by the time I went to bed at 9pm.

                                                About five hours after the vaccine injection, at around 11 PM, I began to feel cold and achy, which soon led to body chills all over. It felt like I could not get warm no matter how many extra blankets I added. This soon led to a fever. I was in an out of sleep for the next few hours and woke up around 2:30 AM. At that point the fever had broken and I was sweating. I still had body aches, which I think was due to my body being tensed up for some many hours, and I had a splitting headache, as well. At around 4:30 AM, I woke up again, with a very sore arm a terrible headache still. I got up and took 400 mg of Ibuprofen and went back to sleep. At 7 AM my alarm went off and all adverse effects seemed to be gone other than a sore arm. The sore arm last for about 6 days.

                                                Injection technique seemed poor as it was the most painful vaccination I&#39;ve ever received, and upper arm became tight and achy immediately. Soreness lingered but the sharper pain went away shortly after. About 8-10 hours later I began feeling nauseous and lightheaded. 12 hours after vaccine I had trouble falling asleep, overcome with nausea and chills.  This turns into sweating and insomnia the rest of the night. The following day I felt better, but the next night (and following one) I continued feeling a bit sick. Currently (3 days later) my upper arm is still very sore and I have lots of muscle/joint aches throughout my whole body.

                                                Vaccination appointment was at 1:30 pm on Monday, April 5. I received the shot at around 2:00pm in my left arm. It hurt going in, but quickly dissipated as I moved my arm. I felt fine for the rest of the day. I felt normal the following morning (April 6), but started to feel tired in the early afternoon. I took a nap around 3:00-4:30pm, and woke up feeling slightly hungry. I went to bed around 11:00pm. I woke up the next day (April 7) with a headache. I called in sick to work and stayed in bed as my headache grew worse and nausea began to appear. I threw up for the first time at 11:00am, then again around 11:30am. I emptied my bowels in between these bouts of vomiting, and my stomach was very obviously empty after the second bout. I took a nap from 12:00-2:00pm, after which I threw up at 2:30pm and then again at 3:00pm and again at 3:30pm. I took another nap from 4:00-5:00pm, then threw up again around 5:30pm. I threw up a seventh time around 6:00pm and saw  a couple flecks of blood in my vomit. Each bout was sudden in onset and violent but quick. I think I burst some of the blood vessels in my throat, because it was sore. I called a friend to take me to the ER, and threw up once or twice more while waiting. On the way to the ER, I threw up for the last time. The ER gave me Toradol, Zofran, and two bags of IV fluids. This improved all my symptoms. The next morning, April 8, I felt much better until 12:00pm, when I laid down for a nap and couldn&#39;t get out of bed until 4:30. My headache had returned so I took Advil, then ate some rice. I felt better from 6:00pm onwards.

                                                I received the vaccine at around 5:23pm, and then about 11pm the same night I was awoken from sleep by terrible body shivers. I managed to doze off for about an hour before I was woken up again by a migraine at midnight; dozed off again, and woke up at around 2 am with a mild fever (around 99.3 degrees). Sometime between the migraine and fever I began to develop terrible body aches as well. The first 24 hours were the worst as I was completely bedridden. The next day, 4/8/21, was better, but the body aches and migraine persisted all day while the fever broke late morning. The third day (today, 4/9/21) everything is feeling better but the migraine is still a persistent issue.

At around 4pm, a mild headache started, and I was experiencing cramping from my chest down to my stomach. I had no appetite that evening. By 8pm, I had a 101.0 fever, and by 9:30pm the cramps were severe in my lower stomach. I was sweating profusely and shaking until I vomited, which helped to relieve some of the stomach pain. Before I vomited, I was in intense pain- possibly some of the worst pain that I have experienced in my life. The sweats and chills alternated throughout the night, and the headache was intense. The next day, the chills, sweats and headache persisted until mid-afternoon, in addition to the occasional stomach pain and diarrhea. The side effects slowly subsided, and I was feeling better by 4/9. The sweating was the longest lasting side effect.

                                                Was administered covid vaccine J&amp;J  on left arm felt a burning sensation just after it which i knew it normal you just got a vaccine. Walked to the observatory area where we are supposed to wait 15min until you are released to go. Well less than 10 min in the observation area that?s when i started to feel un well my body started sweating excessively and thats when i felt numbness on my right side of my head with a tingling sensation couldn?t hear with my right ear and i freaked out when i started to get blurred vision thats when i knew something was wrong i got up to ask for water once i got up i felt like i was going to faint and felt really dizzy. Once i got to the lady that was there in the observation area  she was shocked at how i looked she told me to go sit down and brought me water as she called the ambulance. Once i was sitting down and was brought water i drank like more than half of the water and the numbness was going down from my right side of my head but still had blurred vision and just felt disoriented and not my self. The ambulance took me to the ER once i got there i felt a little better but still disoriented and dizzy. So disoriented that i left the hospital with me actually realizing i had to stay there to get checked because they kept saying i was fine.

I went to sleep around 9pm but my body was so pain that I couldn&#39;t really fall asleep. The whole body was pain. I didn&#39;t have short breathe but I had to breathe heavily to catch myself. Until 2am my arms, legs, face and head started numbing and I couldn&#39;t even grab anything. My hand were like sprained. That&#39;s when my hunsband has to go buy pain killers for me. He also bought thermometer. I checked my Temperature it&#39;s was ~96F. I took ibuprofen and some milk, bread and egg. The pain and numbing was getting off after ~40min after I took Ibuprofen. Then I was able to sleep on bed.

By around 9-10 PM, I had a fever of about 100.5 degrees with pretty severe chills, and my arm had started to hurt VERY badly.  For almost the entire rest of the weekend (from Friday night-Sunday), I was very fatigued and achy and could not lay on my left side due to the soreness in my arm.  The fever seemed to pass by mid-day on Saturday, though, and I was able to go back to work on Monday.  It was not pleasant, but it was totally worth it and a million times better than actually being sick with COVID!

                                                In the evening while making dinner I noticed mild pain at injection site and began to notice increasing chills, and unusually intense tiredness, which were followed that night by a low grade fever, headache, and nausea which led to vomiting.  Was unable to sleep that night and unable to eat most of the following day due to these symptoms, primarily the nausea. Symptoms began to resolve during the later afternoon of April 11th. No medical treatment sought as these were side effects listed on the fact sheet and expected to go away which they did. Still experiencing mild arm pain in injection arm but expecting that to resolve soon on its own.

Around approximately 8pm I was feeling very feverish, experiencing body aches, mental fog, intense shaking and chills,  and within the next few hours threw up multiple times. I eventually fell asleep and sweated profusely, waking up multiple times (unusual for me). The next day I had low appetite, fatigue, and body aches, but other symptoms were reduced.

                                                I got the J&amp;J vaccine around 2:30pm on a Saturday and by 6 or 7pm I was experiencing a really bad headache. This headache extended down my back and around the back and top of my skull. By 8pm I had began experiencing chills, body aches, and nausea. By 9pm I had a fever and could not stand up without feeling like I was going to vomit. Walking to even get water in the other room gave me motion sickness. I was shaking and sweating with a fever all night, was unable to sleep, and experienced hallucinations due to the high fever. The next morning I still had a fever but could finally sleep. I still had a bad headache, body aches, and nausea. I slept most of the day and my fever went down but was still &gt;100 degrees all day. On Monday, I had a mild fever in the morning which went away by afternoon. I  felt weak all day Monday and still experienced body aches and a headache. By Tuesday, I was only experiencing fatigue and brain fog. This lasted about a week.

                                                I had sparkles in my vision 5 min. after getting my shot. They went away quickly, so I wasn&#39;t concerned. I had a little bit of hotness up my neck and a little itchy, but both also were quick to go away. I went home and went to bed without issue. I woke up at 4am crying and in a lot of pain all over my body. I had a crushing headache, my back, arms and legs ached down to the bone. I had a fever of 100.7, and had to call in sick from work. I took 3 ibuprofen and it didn&#39;t help stop the pain or fever. I cried myself back to sleep after wreathing in pain for 3 hours. Woke up again crying again and the pain and fever continued on. I drank 2 beers to see if that would help relax my muscles and back around 3pm and by 4pm I finally felt somewhat better, but still couldn&#39;t get up out of bed. I had to call my brother over to help me and considered asking him to take me to the hospital several times because the pain was so intense. The spot where I got my shot wasn&#39;t inflamed, or if it was I didn&#39;t notice. It did seem a little stiff. I managed to fall back asleep and by the time I woke up again the next day around 5am, I felt completely fine. Fever disappeared and the body pain was gone. It was like nothing had ever happened.

                                                Patient received Janssen COVID19 vaccine at 10:15am. Upon receiving vaccine she sat down on chair to wait for 15 minutes post-vaccination. Just minutes after sitting down patient lost consciousness, fell from chair, hit her head on the floor, seize for a short moment, only to momentarily regain consciousness,  and faint for a second time.  EMS were called and patient was transported to Emergency Department for testing and observation. Patient believes she fainted the first time due to not having eaten much by that point in the day and due to anxiety about receiving the vaccine, and she was told she fainted a second time due to hypotension. She states she has a history of previously fainting during other medical procedures, though no similar previous reactions she can recall after vaccines.

Sunday was dizziness, aches, nausea and cramping in left leg. Monday was nausea, aches, tingling in hands and feet, headache, brain fog. Tuesday I woke up with major imbalance and needed to use walls to walk without falling over. Dizziness subsided after some time to only rapid movements. I had a warm burning sensation in left leg with tingling hands and feet. Moderate headache. Reports came out of stopping the Janssen vaccine so I contacted my doctor with my symptoms and they ordered blood tests for clots.

                                                On 03/18/2021 at 03:30AM I had a lot of arm pain from my shoulder to my elbow in my left arm. This lasted until 03/31/2021.  On 03/18/2021 I woke up with a headache that would not go away. Next, at about 03:15PM I was not able to walk for about 10 minutes. Then, at about 05:00PM I started menstruating. At 07:00PM I had severe pain in my pelvic area for an hour and a half. At approximately 08:30PM I passed a softball sized blood clot vaginally.  I bled heavily through the night.  On 03/19/2021 I still had a headache and no energy at all. I continued to bleed heavily all day as well. 03/20/2021 was the exact same as the days prior. 03/21/2021 I was still bleeding heavily throughout the day with no energy. I still had the headache as well. I started feeling dizzy while walking on this day.  03/22/2021 I went to work like normal. I was cold all day. I was still bleeding, headache and dizziness. It was hard to stand for 30 minutes. While climbing the stairs I got very light headed and dizzy. I could not go up the stairs at a normal pace. 03/23/2021 I had the same symptoms all day but I was getting short of breath walking short distances. I still had very little energy and a headache. I also lost all color in my face and hands. I was still cold all day. I noticed some slight swelling in my ankles.  03/24/2021 The symptoms were getting more intense. I was still cold.  I finally took some aspirin for the headache because it was very severe. The medication didn&#39;t help with it. This routine went on for the next week and the symptoms intensified with each day. Throughout this time I was still passing clots that ranged in size from golf/ping pong ball to baseballs. They were very painful when they passed.  The days from 03/25/2021 to 04/01/2021 were all the same as far as how I felt.  On 04/02/2021 I woke up with the same symptoms but now I could not stay awake for anything. I slept on and off all day. I only ate one meal a day because I was so tired and I had no appetite. The headache was getting worse as the days went on. The bleeding was still happening. It was not as heavy as the weeks before, but enough to be painful still. I also started having abdominal pain.  On 04/03/2021 I was seeing stars when I moved too quickly. My heart rate was elevated with shortness of breath along with the rest of the previous symptoms. My headache however was very intense.  04/04/2021 I still couldn&#39;t stay awake on top of all the other symptoms. The dizziness and stars were more frequent. I couldn&#39;t move my head without seeing stars.  04/05/2021 I couldn&#39;t get warm and I still felt the same way. I called and made a doctor?s appointment for Wednesday the 7th. I had all the same symptoms still and they were getting worse. I had to move in slow motion so I could try to function.  04/06/2021 I woke up drained of all my energy and color. I couldn&#39;t shower because of the pain in my body. I couldn&#39;t stand because I felt like I was going to fall down. I could barely stand up straight let alone walk very far. I was shaking from being so cold. I had all the same symptoms from the days prior. I was in severe pain. I couldn&#39;t sit because of the pain in my abdomen I couldn&#39;t stand because of the weakness in my legs. I could barely see anything because of the stars I was seeing. At this point I had no color and I was barely conscious. That is when my family took me to the emergency room.

                                                On Friday 4/23 I began experiencing a severe headache, chills, and body aches. I had trouble falling asleep because of these symptoms. I had bloody stool. On Saturday 4/24 I was still experiencing body and head pains and continued having bloody stool and by around midnight I had abdominal pains and went to the ER. My appetite was poor the prior week, and since this incident I have hardly been able to eat. I am constantly nauseous and dizzy. After days of not being able to eat, I ate some soup and vomited it back up. I still have abdominal pain, nausea, and am fatigued with a less intense headache.

Thursday evening, 8th, I got hives - all over my body and that started on my left arm and then it didn&#39;t go in my mouth but otherwise all over. I went to my doctor  - the ER at my doctor&#39;s site - on Saturday, 10th. He prescribed me some medicine - don&#39;t remember what plus I took Benadryl . I had to take a week and a half off of work because the medication was so strong.  My hives lasted another week. It stopped growing after that week and then it started healing.

Approx 7 hours after receiving vaccine I experienced a sudden onset of overall body aches and joint pain specifically in my knees. It was kind of severe- even my skin was hurting when I got goosebumps. A fever came on after that and I was shivering, cold, sweaty. Approx 11 hours after injection I began to experience a severe headache and sleepiness. Symptoms continued overnight and disturbed my sleep, but were relieved somewhat by taking ibuprofen. By the next morning (after sleeping 14 hours) I was only feeling tired, arm soreness, and headache (no more fever, chills, body aches). All symptoms except arm soreness cleared up rather suddenly, approx 24 hours after they came on (which was approx 31 hours after injection).

I was walking after the 15 minutes and started feeling weird in my face, I just sat in my car and waited because I had to drive.  I started feeling numbness under my eye and down the rest of my face. The thing that worried me the most I had so much pressure under my eye like it was inside my brain.  The numbness and pain caused me to freak out.  I went to back to the convention center to let them know, they brought the Paramedic to me they started checking me and doing a work up. They told me I wasn&#39;t a life threatening emergency and my vitals were ok. They offered to take me to the ER and I declined and I decided to leave because I have been there for 1hr 45mins. I felt like my symptoms were at 70%. When I got home I freaked out again because the numbness didn&#39;t go away and my face looked like it was a little lower and had a panic attack and went to the ER. They checked on me and told me I didn&#39;t have a stroke. They told me It was a side effect to the vaccine. They told me to follow up with the Neurologist if I have any more symptoms, I have an appointment with them in a couple weeks. I&#39;m a little concerned because there is a minor pain that I didn&#39;t have before on my right side and it worries me.

Around 7am I woke up still with the same symptoms so I took another 2 tylenols.  I remained up but started feeling bad so I laid down and took a nap.  Around 4pm I took 2 more tylenols because I just didnt feel well.  I didnt feel well the remaineder of the day and laid down for bed around 7pm and woke up the next morning and all symptoms had subsided.  I was 16 weeks gestation at the time of the vaccine. EDD-8/25/2021.

I had a bad headache, fever, chills, muscle aches, and nausea. I couldn&#39;t hold down water of food. At 10am the following day (3/21) I was able to take aTylenol and the fever came down. So far, I have taken Tylenol throughout the day and kept the fever down, however I still get bad night sweats and muscle aches. Today (3/23) I feel a little off, but much better.

I slept from 3:45 to 4:30 pm but was still tired and felt weak. I did feel hungry and made dinner over 30 minutes. However, this wore me out. I was even more tired and started getting dizzy. I almost fainted as I made my way to a chair to sit down. I couldn&#39;t eat because of slight nausea and cold chills. I was shaking for about 20 minutes. Eventually, I made it to my bed to lay down, but my legs were shaking as I walked up the stairs. At 6:00 pm, my temperature was 98.8 F. I was freezing a shivering for the next hour in bed under 3 blankets. My hands and feet felt like ice. At 8:00 pm, I had a fever of 100.2  F that lasted all night. My body ached all over, especially at the hips. I couldn&#39;t sit still and couldn&#39;t sleep until 4:00 am. I woke at 8:30 am with some milder aches and fatigue with a temperature of 97.6 F.

About 5 minutes in, I started to become dizzy, my vision started blacking out, my hearing was muffled, I became clammy, sweaty, and experienced mental disorientation. It became harder for me to breathe, but I never struggled to take a breath. I drank some water and waited for the symptoms to subside. I remained seated and these symptoms went away within 5 minutes. After feeling better for about 5 minutes, I felt cold and was shivering. The woman sitting next to me was completely fine after her shot. I&#39;ve since felt a slight burning sensation on my skin in areas that I have scratched lightly. I&#39;m also experiencing strange feelings throughout my body- specifically my head, leg, and hand. It feels like I can feel something in each area for a bit and then it subsides after several minutes.

                                                I had the Janssen covid shot yesterday. The shot stung a little and made my arm sore. Later on in the evening I became tired (so far nothing I didn&#39;t assume would happen) so I took a nap. When I woke up, my arm stung worse than when I had the shot and the pain kept shooting up my shoulder into my neck. I went back to sleep, thinking it was just normal vaccine stuff. When I woke up this morning, I had chills, a fever of 101.7, and muscle aches. My body feels like I have a sunburn all over it. My right arm feels like it was stung by a scorpion. I feel dizzy and nauseous, and I have head fog. I feel the exact same way I did when I had COVID19, but with my arm hurting so bad, anything that barely touches it (such as clothes) shoots a stinging pain up my neck

After layering up it took about 30 minutes for shaking to fully subside and maybe 2-3 hours for body temperature to feel hot. Had headache and dry mouth the rest of the night into the early morning.   Took 400mg ibuprofen after having a morning meal and experienced no other side effects going forward except some tiredness from not getting a full nights rest.

                                                I had the usual fever that began in evening around 8pm, but before that I started developing leg cramping like growing pains behind my left knee. The growing pains persisted behind the left knee for two full days (requiring me to take Tylenol to sleep), then it began behind my right knee, as well. That lasted another 24 hours before the growing pains expanded to both calves, as well. The pain persisted for an entire week and would wake me up in the mornings. I began stretching and working out and now the soreness from my work outs mostly masks the growing pains. I believe today is the first day I am not experiencing the growing pains.

                                                I was fine for the most part after the vaccine. The only thing that hurt was my arm at the injection site. I started feeling nauseous about an hour later. Then at about 9:00 pm, I started to feel really sick. I felt very tired and my whole body hurt. I had a low body temperature, 95 degrees. Chills, fever, shaking, nausea. Very SEVERE symptoms. Felt very disoriented. I thought I was going to pass out and faint. Vision blurry and seen white.  Pounding headache. Ears ringing. I could hardly walk that night, I was crawling on the floor. I felt out of breath. My heart was beating very fast. My left side of my chest hurt by my ribs. When I did wake up from sleep, I woke up with blood in my mouth and dried blood on my lips.

                                                The week prior to delivery (3/22), I started feeling shortness of breath and a headache. I thought it was just normal pregnancy symptoms. That Friday (3/26), I noticed swelling in my ankles. I am a teacher so I asked my school nurse to check my blood pressure; it was high (for me) around 144/88. She said I should call my OB and let them know. I did, and they said to rest for the weekend and they&#39;d see me on Tuesday for my 29 week appointment.   We had a weekend trip planned. We took our son there. The next night, I didn&#39;t feel right. My belly felt hard to me and I wasn&#39;t feeling my daughter move as much, but soon after, I went to sleep. Our two year old son woke us up crying around midnight, and I noticed that I started bleeding when I went to the bathroom. My husband drove me straight to the emergency room. I was diagnosed with sudden and severe preeclampsia. My fibrinogen levels were 100% indicative of a placental abruption. They called the transport team in from hospital so they could transfer my daughter immediately after birth. At 5:57 am on 3/28, my daughter was born via emergency c-section. She is currently fighting everyday at the NICU in the hospital.  On Friday, 4/2 I was readmitted for severe preeclampsia to hospital. My blood pressure was 190/115. I had to receive another round of magnesium sulfate. I was released from the hospital on Sunday, 4/4.

I?m bleeding in my urine, stool, and vaginally. Period came early (unrelated to previous vaginal bleeding) and is not clotting. Just significant amounts of red blood, soaking through one ultra absorbency tampon an hour. I have a headache. Went to the ER and my platelets were (345) and my blood sugar low. My bp was 145/90 which is high for me, from the bleeding.  They said I have a ?higher chance of being bitten by a shark? than having a side effect. They diagnosed me with a single contusion and sent me home. Have been feeling worse since leaving the hospital.

                                                7:00 PM I started feeling tired and a little cold, by 7:30 PM I had horrible body aches and chills and was very tired. I laid down to go to sleep at 8:30 PM and dosed in and out of sleep. Around 10:30 PM I had a fever of 100.7 degree Fahrenheit. Around 12 AM my fever broke and by 1:30 PM I started feeling better. I had a really bad headache all night and into the morning, so bad I could feel throbbing in my teeth. I still have some soreness in my left hip joint and shoulder/neck. I have also had diarrhea once around 12:30 PM today. I did have COVID-19 at the end of December 2020 into January 2020. Not sure if that makes a difference.

Around 9 pm I started experiencing extreme body aches all over that felt like my body was &#34;fighting&#34; against itself. I also experienced chills. I had a hard time sleeping from the pain. The next morning a headache started and progressed into a migraine. I could not get up or open my eyes from how bad the migraine was. I took extra strength Tylenol for the pain with little relief. On Saturday evening the symptoms started to get better and turned more into a headache. I still had the headache on Sunday but it was better after taking the Tylenol. On Monday my arm is now sore (it wasn&#39;t sore prior).

                                                Around 3:15 in the afternoon, I began experiencing severe aches and muscle pains, combined with a growing migraine. Not realizing what it may be related to, I took two ibuprofen and I&#39;ve acetaminophen.  By the time I around home around 6:30, I could barely hold myself up. I ate dinner, which only helped minimally, and by 8 pm felt like death. My husband notice I looked red and felt my forehead, immediately going for the thermometer. I had a fever of 100.5.  We eventually got me into bed after downing a lot of water, but the pain would not ease up. The pain was too excruciating. At 10:30 my husband came to bed and we took my temp again which was 101.6. To help me sleep I took another Tylenol. At 5:45 my work alarm went off and I checked my temp again; still 101.6. I got a cold pack for my migraine and went back to sleep. Slowly throughout the day my fever dwindled, until it finally broke in the early afternoon. By 4:15, as I am writing this, all that&#39;s left is done tiredness, thirst, and a small bit of achiness.

                                                Immediately after getting the shot, I experienced dizziness, nausea, a wierd taste in my mouth,, and my tongue felt numb. The day after I recieved the covid vaccine Janssen, I started noticing the injection site getting red and swollen. By the next day it had grown in size and was itching rather badly. I could sleep from how badly it was itching and burning. It has been 6 days since I got the vaccine and it&#39;s still large and swollen and really itchy. I have been taking ibuprofen for the pain and using benadryl for the itching.

                                                I received the vaccine at 1:30 pm in the afternoon on 3/22/21 and immediately afterwards I felt fine. I waited my 15 minutes and had no signs of a reaction and was free to go. Later in the afternoon, around 3:15 pm, I began to feel a little fatigued and my arm was sore. Around 6:00 pm that same night, I developed a low grade temp of 99.8, I was very fatigued, had achiness all over, as well as my arm was very warm and tender.  I was unable to sleep through the night of 3/22/21 into 3/23/21 and got out of bed around 4: 30 am on 3/23/21 and had to call into work due to the pain. The pain was not an achiness but sharp throughout my whole body. Around 9:00 am, I took a pain reliever and was able to sleep for a few hours. Upon waking up around 1:30-2:00 pm, I was still hurting and was then nauseated as well. I tried to drink water and ate a few crackers to settle my stomach with no relief. At 5:15 pm on 3/23/21, I went to the bathroom and got in the shower to try to help with the pain. After a few minutes in the shower, I became extremely lightheaded and felt like I was going to be sick. I sat down in the bathtub and hollered for my mother to come help me because at this point, I felt like I needed to go to the hospital. Upon sitting down in the bathtub, I began to profusely vomit and started to lose feeling in my legs. My mother entered the bathroom and I explained what was happening and soon after my hands contracted and were stuck in an abnormal position. The pain was unbearable and I was unable to move them from that position. I was unable to get myself out of the bathtub so my mom then called for an ambulance. These symptoms occurred somewhere around 5:20-5:21 pm and EMS was called at 5:22 pm. After a few minutes, I was able to regain movement of my legs but my hands and fingers were still contracted and unmovable. I was able to help my mother enough to put my clothes on and to make my way outside to the front porch to get fresh air. After getting outside, I was accompanied by my mother and my neighbor whom is a nurse. My neighbor looked at my hands and noticed they were discolored and she attempted to straighten out my fingers to no avail. The pain in my fingers was sharp and excruciating but there was also a pins and needle type pain as well. I remained outside until EMS arrived. I was then transported to Hospital where I was seen in the ER for this. Upon arrival to the ER, the physician ordered labs and fluids and stated that apparently he had seen at least 2 other cases that day with a similar reaction to the vaccine. He explained that I was having an adverse reaction to the vaccine and that my hands should return to normal within 24-48 hours. I was then discharged home. As of 3/24/21, I was able to straighten my left hand out and my right hand, my fingers would straighten out, but they would return to a curled resting position. As of 3/25/21, I returned to work and I have some weakness in both hands with a slight discoloration of each hand as well. I am a nurse and work in an office and the physicians in my office commented on the color of skin upon seeing them. I was still very achy and fatigued. My arm was still sore and tender as well. As of today, 3/26/21, I am still achy as well as tired. My right hand has improved some but still returns to a curled resting position. The color of my hands has improved as well. I am a nurse and have seen many things throughout my career. This experience has been absolutely terrifying and I still have no answers as to why this happened to my body. I did my part by being vaccinated and was terrified that I was going to lose my life to it. I pray this does not happen to anyone else.

I told her to stay there for few minutes make sure she was ok. Her husband was getting the vaccine next so I went to start reviewing his paperwork. 5 minutes later he said she didnt feel good. She said she felt like she was going to pass out and wanted to sit or lay down on the floor. Her husband and I helped lower her to the ground and she lay on her side. I asked if she wanted water or anything she said yes. I got her a cold water and she put it against her forehead and said she just needed a minute.   After 10 minutes she got up and sat in the chair and said she felt better.  I then gave her husband his vaccine.   10 minutes later as they wanted after his he said she did not feel well again. She was laying on the floor and said she did not feel like she woulf pass out but just didnt feel right. I asked if she wanted me to call 911 she said yes, just to be checked out.  They came with in 5 minutes and then she said she felt better and was sitting again.   They talked to her and watched her stand up. They checked her pulse and said it was normal and her color was good. She ended up not going with the ambulance and agreed it was probably jsut anxiety  / panic attack.  She walked away fine and also stated she needed to eat dinner.

Fever would not break until later that evening even when taking one Tylenol every four hours. Day two I couldn&#39;t tell if I was actually looking at myself in the mirror. I was dizzy and felt high. I could not remember simple tasks I just did like washing my face in the shower. I felt like I was hallucinating. I went to urgent care and they had no recommendations. I was to take the LSAT today, Saturday, April 9. I had to cancel it because I&#39;m still not fully coherent. I still feel dazed and out of it. I tried to go to work yesterday and old lasted an hour. I had a COVID test performed yesterday on my own accord, not per the request of urgent care, just in case I caught it prior to the vaccine without knowing, and it was negative. I can remember things now at least but I&#39;m still not mentally coherent. It&#39;s a scary feeling. I am about three and a half days post vaccine and slowly becoming myself again. I still feel dazed but I am able to have a conversation and remember it.

                                                My daughter, although has cognitive issues, has not ever displayed any adverse behavior.  We first noticed some unusual behavior on March 31st 2021.  Three days later, on April 3rd, her behavior became more noticeable and unusual for her.  She was saying things that didn&#39;t make any sense and wasn&#39;t sleeping well or not at all.  On Sunday April 4th, her behavior intensified into delusions and hallucinations.  She was talking to people not there and making bizarre statements.  She was taken to emergency hospital late Sunday night and given a blood and urine test and sent home.  By Monday morning, she had not slept the entire night and was shouting out, trying to leave the house and her hallucinations and delusions had intensified.  We took her to Emergency room, where she was diagnosed with psychotic behavior and was admitted to the psychiatric ward.  She is expected to be released today, April 11th, 2021.

I ended up having a 102 degree fever later in the night with continued body aches, nausea, headache and chills. The morning after I got the vaccine I woke up feeling disoriented and nauseous. I had several spells of dry heaving that morning and a headache and body aches most of the day . I had soreness at the injection site for about a week.

                                                Headache (turned into a migraine), extremely drained of energy, lack of appetite, and felt off all day (4/9/21). The next morning (4/10/21) felt the same as the day before, however, had several episodes where I would get really light headed, dizzy, and nauseous. Went to Home Depot at 2:15pm (4/10) and while there my vision blurred and started to fade, I had ringing in my ears and couldn?t hear out of the right and barely was able to hear out of the left. I got very nauseous and I couldn?t breath. I managed to sit on something and put my head between my legs that helped. Fortunately my step- dad was with me and helped me outside while I could barely see and hear and he stated I was very pale. I was having a hard time talking or being conherent. Once outside the symptoms slowly cleared over about the next 6-7 hours. At 4:45pm my mom decided to take me to the doctor but the walk in had just closed and I went to the ER. They stated I had elevated d-dime and did a chest CT scan  to check for blood clots around 7:30pm (I believe not sure exact time) doctor stated they came back clear but when asked if he suspected that the episode and symptoms were due to a dissipated blood clot he would not directly answer it. I overheard him dictating his notes and he started he beloved as such. I have never experienced anything like this before. I still felt drained, headache (migraine), occasionally dizzy, and lack of appetite (4/11/21, 4/12/21) and still currently feel the same drained, migraine, lack of appetite, and occasionally dizzy.

I had full body chills, I was shaking back and forth, my head was pounding so hard it felt like someone had a hammer to it, I got in a hot bath and it felt ice cold to me, I was throwing up, couldnt lay down because every part of my body that was touching something was in terrible pain.  Could not sleep.  The next day I had all of the same symptoms except I was sweating a lot along with everything else.  These symptoms lasted three full days.  It has now been exactly three week, I still have pain in my arm the shot was is, it hurts to raise it.  I also still have an incredibly awful headache that will not go away, I hadn&#39;t had a headache is years and years prior to this, I overall have not felt well ever since I got the shot and my reaction was incredibly awful.  Now I have concerns about my headache and body aches that still are not subsiding.

                                                About 7 hours after injection, I got full body chills. I also felt slightly woozy and a little loopy, but that only lasted about 4-5 hours. (In addition, my body felt a little stiff and my hamstrings got really sore, but I think it was directly related to a squat workout I did the previous day.) My temperature was 99F.  I woke up every 2 hours from my sleep. The chills lasted about 10 hours after their onset.  I took Tylenol at the 10 hour mark, and then the chills stopped. Hamstring soreness also subsided.

                                                My first side effects were fatigue and feeling ?out of it?, which started about 2 hours after the injection. At 7 hours after my left leg became numb and a little sore. I started to notice a feverish, tingly feeling on my skin and this would last at least 24 hours. These symptoms quickly spread through my whole lower body. The chills and intense body aches started at 11 pm. I woke up at 2 am that night and had a low grade fever 99.9 F. I took 2 pills of Tylenol. The fever broke around 3:30 or 4 am and I slept through the rest of the night. The next morning 3/09, I felt fatigue, slow, and woozy. I still had chills and muscle aches, although the intensity was less. Halfway through the day the chills intensified, the muscle aches became more severe, and my eyeballs felt like they were burning in the back of my head. By that evening, the fever was back and I couldn?t think straight. My legs ached with a pain that I?ve never felt before. I did not have a severe headache, but I felt that if I exerted myself too much I would get one. My partner said I could barely form coherent sentences, and I was so weak I couldn?t sit up straight. I took 2 more Tylenol that night, went to bed and slept through the whole night. The morning of 3/10 I woke up feeling tired but my skin did not have that feverish feeling. I was no longer sick. On 3/11 I woke up and did my normal morning routine. I ate an egg, some of a Nutella stuffed scone, and drank coffee and water. I took my 3 pills, loratadine, omeprazole, and a probiotic, and I had a severe allergic reaction within 5 minutes of taking the pills. For the next 10 minutes my breathing became labored and wheezy. I experienced severe eosinophilic esophagitis symptoms. For the next week, my EoE symptoms were heightened. I had a reaction after drinking a seltzer water, which does not usually affect me. Within 2 weeks I was back to normal and to my knowledge have not experienced any other related side effects.

                                                Within 12 hours of vaccine, I experienced fever, chills and sweats. I awoke from my sleep at this point, which was 4AM Friday morning. During the day on Friday, I experienced major fatigue and lethargy and had no emotional symptoms, save for being slightly annoyed/irritated about my condition. I began menstruation on Friday, April 9. Further, I slept 4pm-8pm, did some computer work from 9pm-3am, and went back to sleep. These symptoms were expected. Saturday&#39;s symptoms were not expected, regardless of onset of menstruation, and are what I would consider the adverse event. All day Saturday, I experienced massive melancholy, sadness, hopelessness, and general emotional angst. This is not normal for me, even during my period; I experienced this affect consistently years ago, from 2015-2017, when I was originally diagnosed with depression. Since 2017/2018, I have been in a much healthier emotional state, and have used an SSRI for the last 6 months with success. The following day, Sunday, I began a monophasic combination birth control, which was an original plan prescribed by a physician.  Following this, I experienced roughly 7-10 days of adverse emotional response, namely anger and aggression and mood swings, until I stopped using the new birth control on April 22. My emotional wellbeing took this roughly 7-10 days to recover. The mood change I experienced on Saturday, April 10, based on my previous experiences, was more similar to the mood change I experienced while being depressed rather than the mood change I experience from menstruation and PMS. I strongly request thoughtful consideration of the impact of the vaccine on short-term emotional and mental health changes. I was able to recover from it, and I believe that was because of my experience dealing with depression and mood swings in years past.

                                                Initial injection site felt a lot of pressure and at first there were mild symptoms of ringing in the ears and mind fogginess. Within 5 minutes after receiving injection I got up and walked less than 10 feet when I began experiencing extreme dizziness, ringing in the ears, lightheadedness, felt warm, and began to feel chills/tingling throughout my whole body but especially in my head.  I ended up passing out and was unable to sit up in a chair without assistance. For about 10 minutes I was profusely sweating all over my entire body, had continued chills/tingling, difficulty breathing and was semi coherent. The nurse at the pharmacy had me sniff ammonia salt and gave me water to help. I waited for 20 more minutes before finally feeling able to get up and walk around the store. Body chills and cold sweats continued for a while but no further symptoms at this time (2hrs after vaccination).

I went to a dark room and about 30 minutes later it stopped where a wasn&#39;t seeing a flashing line.  I took melatonin and went to bed figuring I was starting to get tired.  I woke up at 638am. Arm super sore, a red spot over the size of a quarter at injection site. Low grade 99.1 and my entire body hurts and a small headache. Called in to work to rest for the day.

Restlessness and chills continued throughout the night. At 1:30am I finally took OTC flu/cold liquid medicine. (NyQuil) and then continued DayQuil and NyQuil for the next 48 hours.  Fever began and continued until end of day the following day. Although not as serve once fever reducer was being taken. (24 hours) Body aches that night and continuing into the next day. (24 hours) Headache began the next day and continued for almost 48 hours post injection.  Fatigue that night and continued for two days post injection (48 hours) All around would categorize day one after the inject as &#34;flu-like&#34; although this was a bit worse than when I&#39;ve had the flu. Day 2 post injection was more &#34;cold-like&#34; but higher fatigue than I&#39;m used to.  I normally never get headaches, and I had a dull headache for the two days post injection.

                                                Went into intense cold and hot events. Chilled to the bone with many layers on to combat coldness. Then extreme heat and dripping sweat. All over body aches, headache, brain fog, extreme fatigue, haziness, sore arm, feeing very out of it. It lasted all night and then my fever broke at 5 am on 3/27. Then all day of 3/27 I experienced lesser degrees of all of the same symptoms. By the night of 3/27 I felt completely normal.

                                                Approximately 10 hours after injection I became tachycardic--on average experienced a heart rate of 100-120 bpm (resting hearting rate is 65-70 bpm) which continued for 6 hours.  This occurred at the same time as fever (highest 99.4 degrees F) and muscular aches in back and legs. After consulting with doctor, I took a combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen and  half a dose of  metoprolol to lower fever and heart rate.  Experienced a slight headache and had trouble sleeping due to tachycardia.  Tachycardia dissipated 6 hours after onset. All symptoms resolved by 12 PM the next day (approximately 24 hours after injection).

Concerned my bone was hit with a too long vaccine needle. Had chills/fever evening of 4/4/2021 into morning of 4/6/2021?had to take off work. Have had neurological symptoms ongoing with ?brain fogginess? since 4/5/2021. On 4/6/2021, began to see flashes/spots of light in vision of left eye, which worsened through today. Took off afternoon from work and went to an eye clinic to have eye dilated and looked at, but the spots in vision continue through reporting time (4/7/2021, 5pm CT).

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I began to feel nauseous, almost like being car sick while looking at my phone. I also began to feel tightness in my chest. After my 15 minutes were up I asked the administrator of my shot if it was normal that I felt dizzy/chest tightness. They said it was probably fine and just to monitor my  symptoms. I went and sat in my car a few min and I began to feel very strange, it seemed very bright out, I felt weak, and my eyes felt very heavy. I wanted to get home so I started driving but on the highway, my heart beat was very fast and I began to feel like I couldn&#39;t swallow. At one point felt as though I might be about to choke so I pulled over because I thought I was going to have to dial 911 as my throat was feeling like it was closing up. I tried swallowing a few times with great effort and after a few minutes the sensation started to lessen. My throat hadn&#39;t closed up completely, however it did feel like it had swelled up.

I took 1 extra-strength tylenol around 2:30am. Finally fell asleep around 4:30am on 4/11/2021 and when I woke up again at 7:30am on 4/11/2021, all side effects were gone.

Woke up with severe chills / teeth chattering / uncontrollable shivering, my husband said my body was warm but I felt chilled to the bone.  Finally got warm enough to fall asleep around 2am.  The next day, more chills, headache, fatigue, and general malaise all day.  Started feeling better on the third day.  Today, tightness in right side of chest--not sure if related, will be calling the doctor.

                                                When I got the shot, moderately severe pain immediately radiated down my arm and into my last two fingers on my left arm as well as up into my shoulder blade area. It was a lot more painful than I expected based on previous shots. I went to bed with only arm pain and a small headache. Around 11pm that night I woke up in severe pain that was much worse than my chronic pain. I have prescription narcotic pain medication and that did not help. I was unable to leave bed and called my doctor at his home around 7am. I had a very bad headache (and I am used to headaches) and all of the areas of my body that normally hurt hurt much worse. My fingertips started tingling. I was miserable and in bed for about 3 days before starting to feel better, at which point I noticed that my arms and hands were off. The last two fingers on my left hand lost grip strength for about a week. The muscles In my arms kept getting weak. My fingers and the palms of my hands continue to tingling uncomfortably but the weakness is improving.

Chills got worse, whole body was shaking and shivering. Nausea progressed into constant dry heaving. Head was pounding with the worst pain I have ever felt in my life, worse than natural child birth and worse than running marathons. The nausea was so bad and I could feel my fever burning and getting worse. I was about to vomit so got out of bed to go to the toilet to vomit and the whole room started spinning completely out of control. My heart was racing and I could hear it and feel it pounding rapidly through my ears. I couldn?t walk and was so disoriented I crawled to the bathroom to throw up in the toilet. My husband heard me and came and picked me up off the bathroom floor and carried me to our bed. As the night progressed fever got worse, head was in almost unbearable pain, severe body aches over my whole body, heart racing and horrible nausea and dry heaving.  I made it through the night. For two days after I had a headache and fever  and nausea and body aches and couldn?t get out of bed to care for my children. By the third and fourth day I was able to get out of bed at times and still felt fatigue, nausea, headache and body aches. Anytime I would stand up for 10 days after the vaccine it felt like I was rocking on a boat. I am almost at 2 weeks and still feel fatigue and dizziness at times. On April 15th, 9 days after my vaccination I had symptoms of a blood clot in my leg. I went to the Emergency Room and was diagnosed with a superficial blood clot of the leg as well as swelling in the vein. I am thankful to be alive!

The shivers stopped and I became extremely tired. I got out of the bath and had to climb back to bed because the room was spinning and I was nauseous. I did not have a fever at this time. I was able to go back to sleep. I woke up about 2 hours later sweating and with a fever of 100.7. I slept for another 3-4 hours and woke up symptom free. My morning went on normal. Ate breakfast and hung out. I was tired in the early afternoon and took a 4 hour nap which is not normal but expected since I didn&#39;t get a good night sleep with symptoms mentioned above in the middle of the night.   I also missed my period that month. My period was supposed to start March 30th and it never came. Confirmed I am not pregnant. Period returned in April on normal schedule.

My pregnancy has thus far been really easy with no complications.  I had a low grade fever that I took Tylenol to treat.  I had pretty bad muscle and joint pain, chills, and could not stop shaking.  I just felt freezing.  Once my fever broke I felt extremely hot all night.  The next morning I was exhausted and had a lot of the muscle and joint pain still.  I marked on my report that it would&#39;ve stopped me from going about my normal daily activities, as I could not have gone to work and spent most of the day resting.  For the next few days I was tired and my eyes ached.  On Monday and Tuesday I had a headache in the afternoon.  Yesterday afternoon my eyes finally stopped aching and everything seems to be back to normal.

                                                From 6pm-5am I experienced a terrible migraine,  horrible body aches (every joint and muscle was throbbing), upset stomach, uncontrollable shaking/chills, and light headedness. Could only sleep short spurts after taking 400 mg of Ibuprofen. 24 hours after the vaccination, my body is still achey, sore at injection site, and uneasy stomach.

We continued to talk to her and observe.  She was awake and coherent mainly embarrassed.  Approximately after 15 to 20 mins we helped her to a chair. We continued to observe and  noticed nothing more.  She was not having breathing or communication issues, we asked if she would like a water and got her one.

The pain was also accompanied by chills.  I took Tylenol for the symptoms but the pain did not subside. This morning, at 8:30am the joint pain is still very strong.

                                                I received the vaccine at 36 weeks pregnant. I am estimated to deliver April 16th.  About 8 hours after receiving the vaccine I noticed general bodily discomfort and achiness, as well as a loss of appetite and a headache. About 30 minutes after that I developed chills but no fever, and was fatigued enough to fall asleep an hour before my usual bedtime. I slept terribly in the night due to the achiness and pain at the injection site making it hard to lay on my side, which I have to do for pregnancy. I went to bed with chills but woke up sweating and discovered a fever of 100.2 around 12:45 AM. By 5:30 my temperature was down to 98. The following morning I continue to experience achiness, fatigue, decreased appetite, and a headache. I seem to have felt some pelvic cramping associated with pregnancy but it may be unrelated.

                                                After being administered the vaccine at 7:12 am, when the nurse stood me up and started to walk me to the holding area, I became dizzy, my legs got weak, and there was a loud ringing in my ears. I nearly collapsed as I reached the seat in the holding area they were taking me to. I placed one 0.5MG tablet of my prescription Alprazolam in my mouth and waited for the nurse to bring water. They took me via wheelchair from the holding area to a secluded spot behind a curtain. There, I laid on a cot, received cold water, and a nurse talked to me while I recovered. It felt like I was having an anxiety attack, which has never happened to me after getting a shot before. Fitbit heart rate data shows my heart rate at 105 BPM at 7:00 am (going through the admission process, walking around the facility), 83 BPM at 7:10 am, 79 BPM at 7:15 am, 74 BPM at 7:20 am. Between 8:15 am and 1:25 pm, my heart rate remained between 63 and 89 BPM. My arm was sore and my skin hurt (an issue that I have when I feel very stressed). Additional symptoms arose around 1:35 pm. I began going through cycles of chills, sweating and overheating. My heart rate ranged from 127 BPM and 93 BPM for the remainder of the night. I took Tylenol at 7:07 PM to help with my fever.

                                                Patient was given the vaccine at 12:26 pm and was advised to wait for observation. While waiting, patient started to complain of some anxiety and lightheadedness.  We advised patient to wait a little longer for further observation. A few minutes later, at 12:36 pm patient said the lightheadness was getting worse and then passed out for a few seconds while waiting sitting in our observation area. The pharmacy technician was in the area to hold up the patient and keep her calm while patients mother requested that EMS/911 be called.  EMS came minutes later and patient was coherent and talking to the technician and her mother. EMS asked patient if she wanted to be taken to the hospital and patient agreed.  Patient called a few hours later to follow up with pharmacy staff and informed us that she was discharged and feeling better.

While the rest of my body was of normal temperature. Shortly after, I?d say about 45 minutes after injection, came the cold chills. I was freezing cold and shaking  fallowed by a fever. I became very foggy. It was hard to keep a conversation and had extreme waves of nausea. My mouth would salivate like the vomit was coming. I never actually vomited. But that continued  for the next 36 hours. I had to call out of work yesterday. Starting 24hrs after injection. I could not get out of bed. My body was very weak. Aches everywhere, I was freezing cold shaking with chills yet waking up in my bed covered in sweat. I was extremely restless and kept waking up to put a cold towel on my head to try to break my fever. At this point my headache was so severe. Any movement felt like my head would explode.  It?s now 48 hours after the injection my head is still pounding and my body still full of aches. Left arm is still really sore. I truly regret taking the vaccine. And would recommend others to not take it until further testing goes into this product.

                                                Re: Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Received vaccine at about 10:21am. Developed possible adverse effects at about 4:00pm. Initially I noticed weakness and feeling &#34;out of it&#34;. I was grocery-shopping at the time, and pushing the cart, standing upright, etc. was becoming difficult. Sometime between 4:00pm and 5:00pm I became delirious and also was no longer able to stand or sit upright. In my altered state I believed that my muscles, especially those in my legs, were turning into goo and then turning into normal muscles again. I experienced fever dreams. I had hot flashes and chills. I had the worst pain that I have experienced in recent memory.  I think that I may have had a migraine episode in addition to, and triggered by, these experiences. I had nausea (no vomiting).  Most of these events lasted until about between 12:30am to 1:00am, which was when I fell asleep. When I woke up the following morning (today as I am reporting), I still had a mild headache and exhaustion but the other events had resolved.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I began by feeling stiffness and soreness in my joints and muscles, particularly my back and lower body.  The pain and stiffness worsened, and I began to feel ill similar to a common cold. Approximately 12-18 hours after receiving the vaccine, my symptoms worsened so much that I could hardly stand or move around, and began throwing up. This continued and worsened as my entire body felt pain and stiffness, I felt very weak and fatigued, and I was throwing up violently with frequency. I threw up so much and with enough force that I started to see bright red blood in my spittle and vomit. I had a severe headache accompanying these other symptoms.  I also had problems with homeostatic temperature regulation  and was simultaneously sweating profusely and very warm to the touch while feeling like I was cold.  I was shaky and experienced tremors and twitches in my hands, arms, legs, and feet. I kept throwing up and experiencing these symptoms for approximately 72 hours after recieving my vaccine.  I was virtually incapacitated for those three days of severe illness-like symptoms.

I also had numb fingertips which lasted for around 20 minutes right after the chills really set in. I&#39;m not positive its related but two nights after my vaccine injection, I woke up at night because my feet were itching and hot. They also had the pins and needles sensation and these symptoms lasted around 20 to 30 minutes. I have never had that happen before so I assume it was vaccine related.

                                                Fifteen minutes after leaving  I was experiencing dizziness. During the night while trying to fall asleep I was hallucinating like someone was in my room but no one was there. The next day I felt like I had the flu, and just arm pain. Following days I felt tired and had a headache on the top of my head ranging from a seven to a ten in pain. I tried Tylenol but no help because body rejected it. I tried Excedrin migraine for headaches but still no let up. I am still experiencing headaches and Fatigue.

My body shook, and it appeared that I had a seizure. Immediately upon waking I started vomiting and having uncontrollable bowel movements for about an hour. I felt confused for about 30 minutes and was unable to speak for a few moments upon waking. When I arrived at the hospital I was still vomiting and having uncontrollable bowel movements. I was given fluids and zofran and sent home without further testing.

                                                On March 6, 2021, I received the Johnson and Johnson Vaccination at about 8:15 am.  Around 7:00 pm that evening I started to experience the normal symptoms that they had advertised. Yes, I felt like I COVID again for about 48 hours, but nothing alarming.   On March 12, 2021, I went to an appointment with doctor due to extreme abdominal cramping and very heavy period.  This is not totally out of the norm due to my infertility, but I felt like something was off. I had random abdominal bruising and ruptured cyst pain; which I am still experiencing. She ordered an ultrasound to rule out a mass in my uterus due to the extreme pain and bruising.   On March 22, 2021, I woke up at 3:00 am with extreme stomach pain and extreme diarrhea.  As the morning went on I began to feel worse and worse. Other symptoms I experienced were; severe headache, shortness of breath, heartburn (I felt like I was having a heart attack), nausea, back pain, and extremely tired.  At 6:30 am  took me to the ER due to my worsening symptoms. Everything checked out fine and they thought I could have an ulcer, but I wanted to make you aware of these symptoms that I experienced.   I still have days that I experience some of these symptoms, but they have been under control and monitored closely.

I could not finish a sentence without pausing for air.  It seemed OK if I was sitting still but if I tried to move I got really short of breath. I went to the ER and they ran tests but they did not find anything. I was discharged and I felt a little better that evening. The following day I still had difficulty catching my breath with activity. On the third day I felt normal with no trouble breathing.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Mid Saturday night I woke up to chills and was shaking so bad I couldn&#39;t fall back asleep even after adding another layer of clothes and blanket. Sunday morning I was still very cold and tired from not sleeping. I developed body aches but they were everywhere not just my arm. I was very fatigued and didn&#39;t have an appetite. The worst part was getting a migraine with extreme light sensitivity. I couldn&#39;t stand to be around any windows without blinds. I spent the day in my bedroom sleeping with the curtains closed and an eye mask on. By that night, the migraine had subsided but I was adding hot flashes to the problem list. Had a pretty restless night again on Sunday. Woke up Monday to the light sensitivity back but not as severe. I took the day off work because I couldn&#39;t handle looking at a computer screen all day. By about 1pm I was feeling mostly back to normal. My arm is still sore near the injection site and I&#39;m a bit fatigued at times but those are the only things remaining.

Headache and body aches became intense by 6:20pm on the day I received the vaccine. I took Tylenol Extra strength which helped the body aches and lowered the fever a bit but did little for the headache. Chills started around 10pm accompanied by vomiting and severe diarrhea at 1am. Blood pressure spiked at 142/101 shortly after third vomiting episode. Called family to take me to ER but didn?t end up going because I was able to get vomiting and blood pressure under control by 3am. Figured doctors would just hook me up to an IV of fluids and send me on my way anyway, not something I can afford. No more fever or chills since 4am on 3/14/21. Headache and diarrhea and slight nausea still persisting 29 hours after the shot. Treating symptoms with Tylenol, water, pedialyte, chicken broth, and toast diet. Unable to care for my children, worst I?ve felt in years. Regularly get the flu shot with no side effects.

Chills lasted for hours and couldn&#39;t stop shaking, so took Tylenol at 12:15am. Around 1:00am the chills subsided. Around 2:00am fever burnt off, sweating and hot. Couldn&#39;t sleep the rest of the night. Slept from 8am-10am and woke with just headache. Took Tylenol around 10:30am to help with headache and it did start to subside. Was mostly fatigued and muscle aches the rest of the day until 6pm when I started to get cold again. Feels like the fever and chills are coming back and it&#39;s currently 7:30pm, so assuming it&#39;ll be another night of this.

Around 12:30AM I felt feverish, and body aches, severe headache and chills that woke me up. Took Tylenol. Felt like I had the flu. Next day kept treating with Tylenol as needed and the fatigue, body aches and low energy persisted along with headache but by night time I was feeling somewhat  better. Next day I was much better that I could work from home. Still felt a little fatigued other symptoms subsided.

                                                Currently pregnant due May 31. I got the vaccine at 4 pm on Wednesday. At around 6pm I started to get a headache, I took 2 tylenol but it continued to get progressively worse. By 7 I was starting to get really fatigued and fell asleep. I woke up around 8 or 9 still fatigued with body aches and a headache. The body aches and headache continued to worsen, but due to pregnancy I could not take any more tylenol. Around midnight I got out of bed to use the bathroom and immediately started violently shivering. It continued for a few minutes after I got back into bed, it did cause a lot of pain in my joints and muscles. A few hours later I woke up very hot and sweaty. The next day (Thursday) I continued to feel very fatigued with body aches and a headache to the point where I had to stop working even though I work from home. The following day (Friday) I was still mildly fatigued and had some body aches, and my brain felt very foggy so I took off work again. I regularly checked my temperature during this time and did not have a fever.

                                                I was fine from 10am until 3:30pm on the day of injection. I started to feel feverish and chills at 3:30 and it progressed into a 99.2 fever with all over body aches and a headache and chills. I took alkasletzer cold medicine with Tylenol in it to help with the fever. It got the symptoms down where I could move and stood in the hot shower for 30 minutes to help warm me up. I felt slightly better and still had fever symptoms and severe body aches. I started feeling unable to move due to the fever symptoms again around 9pm and took 2 extra strength Tylenol that eventually worked and I had some nausea with that. I hadn?t been able to eat because of the symptoms and the nausea could have been from taking meds on an empty stomach. I finally felt able to eat around 10pm and had some food and went to bed. I could barley sleep all night and was tossing and turning due to fever. My nose started to get runny around 10pm before I went to bed. I woke up the next day and still had the fever symptoms, body aches and the worst headache I have ever had, a 10 on the pain scale. I took another 2 extra strength Tylenol and went to sleep for 2 hours. I woke up and could tell the fever had broken and my head was still in pretty severe pain- about a 7 on the pain scale.  I was incredibly fatigued the entire day and felt hot and cold throughout the day. I was incredibly weak and needed a lot of rest. I still didn?t sleep well through the night and woke up friday feeling fatigued. I expended some energy in the am at the dog park and had to sleep for 3 hours during the day which is atypical for me. I woke up Saturday morning (today) still feeling a headache and exhaustion. I will see how the rest of the day goes and am hoping to feel better and don?t know when the symptoms will stop.

The biggest symptoms I had were severe body aches, debilitating chills, fluctuating fever, headache, and no appetite.  4/1/21: * 11:15am: Vaccine administered * 12pm-6pm: Arm soreness, feeling cold/experiencing some chills, minor headache and stomach ache (I felt a little off but couldn?t tell if it was real or in my head) * 5:30pm: I walk home from work, which takes about about 35 minutes. Regret the decision about 10 mins from home due to onset body aches and fatigue  * 6pm: I go straight to bed freezing with crippling chills, body aches, and a headache * 8pm: Extreme nausea kicks in, I take Advil and cannot stomach more than one bite of food; still experiencing chills and body pain * 9pm: 100.7 fever, the chills subside and I start to get hot * 10:15pm: I finally eat some food, drink more water, body still aches, start to get chilly again  * 10:45pm: My fever is down to 99.3, my ears really hurt, like, ear-infection-style pain  * 11:15pm: 12ish hours post-vaccine, I have severe body aches, I alternate between really hot and cold, take more Advil and go to bed (finally fall asleep at midnight)  4/2/21: * 6:15am: Wake up; I spent the night tossing and turning with extreme night sweats. At this point I still have a pretty bad headache and painful body aches, specifically in my lower back and legs; fall back asleep * 8am-9am: Wake up and take more Advil. My whole body hurts. Toss and turn for a bit more. Small fever?99 degree temperature. Make coffee but have absolutely no appetite. * 9am-10am: So sweaty, fever is fully breaking * 11am: No more fever, slight headache, and body aches seem to be subsiding * 11:45am: Almost exactly 24 hours later and feeling good, comparatively speaking. Finally eat a bagel * 5:30pm: After lunch, I took a nap. My body aches have completely subsided, no fever. I still have a small headache and my ears still ache. But overall, I feel pretty normal! Just a little tired but probably from lack of sleep last night.

I have taken ibuprofen for pain control every 4 hours.

RN was by the side of the patient, was instructed to check VS: BP 140/70, T 97.9, O2 Sat 98% RA, RR 20, HR 87. Patient was awake and alert in the sitting position with her husband. 6:42 pm, unable to contact command center (1-888-634-1130), 911 was called. Per EMT instructions, patient was able to life her both arms in the air, able to smile, and ale to repeat the sentence as stated y the EMT staff on the phone. EMT arrived at 7 pm,  he explained to patient that she would not be charged since patient was nervous of the charges that might be imposed to her. He performed assessment and VS: BP 154/101, HR 98, O2 Sat 100% RA, RR 20, patient stated her tingling and numbness sensation on her left arm was gone and she would not want to be escorted to the hospital for further assessment and treatment. Patent signed the form for further treatment with EMT staff. Patient was able to ambulate with steady gait without any issues with her husband to the parking lot. A nurse educator reported with the incident. Suggestion was made to have a form that patient/family can sign to refuse further treatment and able to be discharged with their decision.

Symptoms started about 7.5 hrs after injection, mild at first but quickly became severe. When I felt well enough the next morning to try to take another pain/fever reducer, I did with no vomiting and was able to eat a small breakfast, and now it is about 27 hrs after injection and I feel almost 100% again. :)

Took 2 Tylenol at 4:45 am, ate a snack, and wrapped up in blankets. Significant relief from symptoms at 5:20 am. Went back to sleep. The following day, I had a mild headache, mild arm soreness, mild sinus congestion, and moderate tiredness.

                                                Roughly 10 hours after injection, moderate muscular pain at injection site, and severe pain in old lower back injury - chronic bulging disc. Back pain onset was severe enough to wake me up from sleep and persisted despite use of OTC pain management. Used 2x extra-strength 500mg acetaminophen, only dulled pain, then 600mg ibuprofen approximately 8 hours later to same result. As of 27 hours post injection, pain is still moderate and disruptive. Lack of sleep and pain make it hard to determine if the fatigue is a unique symptom or purely the result of the pain symptoms. In a non-measurable manner, having had this back injury for over 10 years with multiple reoccurrences, it feels like the joint/disk swelled enough for it to press on the spinal nerves despite attempts to mitigate with ice, elevating feet and head to open intervertebral space.

Headache developed over the course of the afternoon and by the evening I had a high fever and chills. Headache and nausea continued. Low fever, headache and brain fog continued the following day. Fatigue and brain fog along with a heavier period occurred on the 3rd day. Over One week out and there?s still slight pain in my shot arm along with fatigue. I?ve had a few headaches that come and go that may also be vaccine related

I took Tylenol or Ibuprofen over the course of the 10th and 11th to help with the headache/migraine and low-grade fever. Each time I took the medicine, it made me feel hazy and didn&#39;t help my headache much. I still had a migraine on the 12th. Today, the 13th I feel much better.

I also had numbness and tingling in my legs. The headache persisted for 5 days, alone with muscle weakness and nausea.  Numbness and tingling were intermittent.

I was able to help the symptoms with ibuprofen. The hot flashes and headache, continued sporadically 2 days following the injection.

After taking an extra strength Tylenol and eating a piece of bread I went back to sleep for 90ish mins and woke up feeling  a little better. At that point my heart rate had dropped below 100 bmp.

                                                I received J&amp;J vaccine on 31st March. I?m 32 years old woman.  I?m currently out of states, I came to another Country on 9th April. About 2days ago, I observed some tiny spots on my fingers (3 on middle finger, and 1 on ring finger - refer attached image). Also, at the same time I felt little disorientation where I was almost blank for just few seconds. I believe that might be due to empty stomach/low sugar. And then, I?m having a headache today.  After the vaccination, I had a fever of 102.7 degrees for about 2days.  I?m just concerned that this is nothing to worry about. And, if there are some blood tests or scans that I should get done just to be safe.

                                                About 5 hours after shot, I started feeling weak, tired, and nauseas with a slight headache.  I had discomfort trying to fall asleep. I woke up at 12:43AM with a throbbing headache. I was hospitalized at 18 for viral meningitis, and this was a similar, intense pain. It felt like I had a crown on,  and that crown on my head caused a very intense, throbbing, debilitating pain. I also had chattering teeth, shaking with a freezing fever. I eventually fell asleep and woke up again at 2-something. My fever and headache still intense, but now I was drenched in sweat and burning up. I wanted to get up and find my thermometer--I remember digging through my drawers and closets around my apartment,  I remember speaking but no recollection what I was trying to say (I live alone), and I remember seeing my reflection looking glazed over. I don&#39;t remember getting back in bed but woke up again after 5AM. I still had a bad headache, though less severe, and felt my body was alternating very hot sweating and very cold freezing--like it was mix and matching. I eventually fell asleep again and woke up around 7:45AM. I was fatigued with a fever and chills all day.  I found my thermometer and went to sleep with a 100.3 fever that night. I was much better next day, just slight fatigue.

                                                The first 24 hours were very difficult for me. I have never been so sick in my life. I got the typical muscle aches, chills, etc. In fact I got every side effect listed plus more. I want to discuss the other side effects. On day 3 I started to develop extreme chest pain and pressure. It is a dull pain as if someone if sitting on my chest that will not go away. I also started to experience sudden bouts of dizziness and vertigo. It will not go away. Today is Day 7 and I spent the night in the emergency room because my chest pains got so strong. However, all the work up came back okay. I also have this strange feeling of electrical shocks running thru my head, those last about .5 seconds and go away, but it is a very weird feeling I have never experienced. I also have a strange desire to constantly burp, when I do my chest pain feels better. If I don&#39;t burp my ears start to feel full and sometimes they ring. Its Day 7 and I still feel SO miserable. Why id no one speaking about these chest pains? I know 5 people who have experienced the same.

By 6:30 PM I was feeling shaky and weak so I laid down. At 6:45 PM I was feeling feverish (chills even though my body was radiating heat). I woke repeatedly due to muscle soreness and chills. At 10:30 I checked my temperature and got a reading of 103.2 F. I had a mild headache as well. I drank some green fruit/vegetable juice and went back to tossing and turning on the couch. I took an Ibuprofen at 5AM with water and was able to get a couple of hours of sleep. !) AM I checked my temp again and got a reading of about 98 F. I was still feeling a bit sluggish and slightly dizzy at times throughout the day.

                                                Immediately felt sore arm after injection. I could almost feel the vaccine going into my arm. It felt very heavy. A few hours after vaccine, felt weird &#39;brain fog&#39;. This lasted through the following day. Not a typical headache.   6 days later -- experience &#39;brain fog&#39; experience again... again lasted 24-36 hours.  Still able to work as normal , just harder to focus. Also had weird sensations of goosebumps randomly when not cold.   15 days later -- notice that if I rubbed arm near injection site it was sore. Arm not sore at all unless touching it. Then notice a bruise at the site of injection the following day. Also feeling light-headed.

After a few minute the dizziness began to subside, but the sensation in my arm continued for approximately 45 minutes.

                                                Within 17-20 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I felt a burning, hot sensation in my throat. I let paramedics know and sat for about 10-15 more minutes. My mouth and throat became extremely dry and I had a tingly feeling in my feet. I also experienced high anxiety. An ambulance came and proceeded to bring me to the nearest hospital. In the ambulance, I began coughing, which caused tightness in my lungs and moments of needing to cough. My vitals were normal in the ambulance and I was given IV fluids.  I arrived at the hospital around 4:30 pm. When checked by triage about 2 hours later, the nurse reported my vitals were normal, and that I shouldn&#39;t need epinephrine or lab work. She reported that &#34;hopefully a triage doctor would be able to see me soon.&#34; I continued to cough into the evening, and began wheezing from coughing. I waited in the ER waiting room until just before 10pm. Triage could not give  a time estimate of when I could be seen. I needed an inhaler or nebulizer treatment long before.  I left the hospital after the nurse removed the IV port. At this time, the nurse reported my &#34;rash on my chest was gone,&#34; although she did not mention a rash earlier in the evening and I did not notice it (had a jacket on). I did not need to sign or receive discharge paperwork because I was never seen by a doctor. I took Benadryl and gave myself a nebulizer treatment once I got home and all adverse reactions were gone the next morning. I experienced flu-like symptoms the next day.

                                                The night of the vaccine I had muscle aches and I started gagging. The muscle aches were better in a few days. I went to the Emergency room the night of the shot.  I was diagnosed with a bladder infection. The urge to gag was constant. I was given some nausea medicine in the ER and it helped a little I became dehydrated after a week. I had no appetite and had the gag reflex problems for three weeks.  I was diagnosed with a kidney stone about three weeks after vaccination. My anxiety was also bad during that time. I have been feeling better, less anxious and eating more for the last two weeks.

This went on for several hours before finally falling asleep. The day following the injection, more and more symptoms began to arise such as muscle soreness, cold/hot sweats, low-grade fever (99.5%), chest pain/pressure, sweating, dizziness/disorientation and a headache. Monday night I experienced the low-grade fever however after going to bed, woke up around 5AM barely unable to stand, very disoriented and upon taking my temperature, I took note that I had a fever of 100.9%. Today, Tuesday May 11th, I am experiencing chest pain/pressure, low-grade fever, headache and am lethargic.

                                                The day after the vaccine I had a low-grade fever and felt bad. I was extremely fatigued and I felt weak. It almost felt like the flu. I had nausea at night and I felt flushed. I consulted with  Urgent Care and they asked me to come in and get a COVID-19 test which was negative. Those symptoms lasted a full week. My period is also out of sync and it lasted longer than usual for a total of two weeks. It kept coming and going. It normally only lasts five days and it is consistent. I was also having cramping on my left lower abdominal region.

                                                Two weeks after vaccine woke up with tingling running up and down left leg and being based in the left foot. Throughout the day tingling turned to numbness as if leg were asleep, and feeling in foot turned to strong pain. Had ultrasound in the leg to check for clots (although they did not check foot) and nothing was discovered. After this pain escalated and a week after I was unable to keep my foot still for more than a minute without the intense pain rushing back - the feeling was as if my foot were cramping to an extreme. Elevating helped somewhat but for the most part if I wasn?t moving I was crying in pain. The numb feeling is still there as of over a month later but I?m able to hold still without feeling as if my foot is rapidly atrophying.

I stayed home from work. Over the next few days my fever subsided but my headaches, body aches, nausea and dizziness continued. My headaches worsened and on 4/15 my Dr ordered a brain MRI as well as blood work to be sure of no clotting. The MRI came back normal but I later went to the ER due to worsening severe headache and rapid heart rate. I was later discharged and the Dr told me he believes I am having a more severe pro-longed reaction to the vaccine and that he thought my symptoms would subsided around two weeks post vaccine. I am still currently having sharp headaches and joint pain, I have needed to miss work multiple times due to all of this and not feeling well enough to work or do my normal activities.

I have had no complications so far in my pregnancy. On the day after receiving the vaccine, I developed a severe headache, congestion, dehydration, and fatigue. I felt feverish and had chills, but I did not have a fever. I was unable to go about my daily activities (I was not working on this day). These symptoms went away about 36 hours after being vaccinated. I also had pain at the injection site.

                                                Yesterday I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I was the last appointment, so they observed me for 5 minutes, and I left. After riding in the car for a few minutes, I noticed that I was having a hard time breathing and my throat felt like it was starting to swell. By that time, the clinic was closed, so I went to the emergency room just in case and sat in my car since they didn&#39;t allow people to sit in the waiting room because if covid.  It started becoming increasingly difficult to breathe, and I was feeling more and more swelling of my throat and tongue. I was having a lot of dizziness, nausea, facial flushing, palpitations, and some mild confusion. I then started getting numbness in the bottom half of my face. Over time, the numbness spread, mostly staying on the left side of my body (face, scalp, lower arms and legs, left side on tongue and inside of mouth). I also started getting a prickling burning pain sensation for brief periods of time where I had numbness. I had decided that if my breathing worsened at all, I would go to the er even though I can&#39;t afford it.   After about an hour and a half, my breathing started to feel less constricted and like there was less resistance. The swelling in my throat was mostly in the upper throat where I had difficulty swallowing but not as much difficulty breathing. The numbness continued to get worse and was sometimes disappearing and reappearing in the same spot.  At 9:30 pm we went to go get some benadryl. I continued feeling less and less swelling and having an easier time breathing. At that point, I went home. Once I was home, my breathing continued to improve and the numbness started to dissipate.  In the middle of the night, I started itching and getting widespread hives and getting a sharp burning pricking pain that would last a few seconds in different areas. The numbness also started coming back mostly in my face. I continued to have difficulty swallowing.  I am feeling much better today. I still feel some slight swelling in my throat when I swallow, but my breathing is fine. I&#39;m still itchy and occasionally breaking out in hives. Im having mild lower facial numbness. I&#39;m also starting to get the normal side effects of fever, headache, arm soreness, and body aches. I&#39;m taking benadryl every 4 hours.

                                                About a minute after I had the injection, my arm started hurting and it felt like hot water was coursing through my veins. I got an immediate headache that progressed into light headedness, my vision got blurry and I saw colors and then I started to lose my hearing, it felt like there was cotton in my ears. The nurses said I went pale and they called it a panic attack, but it was unlike any panic attack I have ever had in my life. I?ve had my TDAP updated a few years ago and got a flu shot and did not feel anything like this. I was rolled out of the room on a wheel chair because I was too dizzy to walk and then threw up several times into a bag and peed myself. It took about 20 minutes before I felt normal again.   The following day my arm felt numb and incredibly sore, I couldn?t raise it that far up without excruciating pain. I felt weak, fatigued and dizzy and was unable to use the bathroom. I had fever sweats and chills on and off. I was not able to sleep well, but I think that?s because of the pain in my arm.

Started experiencing fogginess and feeling cold at 1:00 am 20Mar2021. Went to bed at 1:00 and dreamed of being sick until waking up at 8:30 am 20Mar2021. Woke up and was very weak (could not push toothpaste through toothpaste tube), almost passed out in trying, so I sat on the floor. Tried getting back to bed and was extremely nauseous and started vomiting. After that, I had the sweats/fever/chills for a couple hours (until ~11:00am), and was fatigued until 4:00 pm. Spent most of the day sleeping, unable to do anything. Today, 22Mar2021, feel slight tingling on palm of left hand and fingers. Injection site is still sore and bruised

                                                Almost immediately, I had pain in my arm that shot into my shoulder when the vaccine was being injected into my arm. I did not mention it to the pharmacist since I figured it was normal. I sat for 15 minutes as instructed, but  other than feeling sore, I was normal. So we left. After about another 15 mins, My head started for feel &#34;drunk&#34;. I contemplated pulling over since I was driving home, but decided to get home asap.  As time went by, my head felt more and more cloudy, fuzzy, heavy and as if I&#39;d been drinking alcohol. That night, I couldn&#39;t sleep. I even took hydrocodon with tylenol (the pain was that bad) and an ibprofin. It helped a little. I finally got to sleep at 3am, Just to wake at 7am for work. All day, I could not focus, my head was super fuzzy. I had a bad headache, I felt super sick. My stomach also hurt and I couldn&#39;t lift my arm. I tried taking a nap half way through the day because I kept making mistakes at work. It did not help how I felt. Since then, my symptoms have eased but now I seem to have a bad case of acid reflux, which I didn&#39;t used to get randomly.   I have not been to my dr yet and I haven&#39;t done anything else for it. I was informed that I should report my symptoms by a family friend.

                                                Started with chills pretty shortly after the vaccine was injected.  After about 6 hours I could tell I was not feeling great.  My husband said I looked very pale and out of it all of the sudden.  I became extremely tired and disoriented.  I don?t remember driving myself home that evening after picking up my kids from dance.  By the time I was home it was now around 8 pm.  I was so cold my entire body was trembling.  I kept taking steaming hot showers but I couldn?t feel it, I was still freezing and shaking.  I was very weak and started having extremely horrible body aches and pains.  Specifically my legs were hurting the worst, I remember my hip joints felt like they?d buckle underneath me.  I got a headache that was unbearable.  It felt worse than a migraine.  It hurt to move my head or use my eyes at all.  I went to bed and was under several blankets and a heating pad while also running a space heater right next to me.  I still could not get warm at all.  I hallucinated that I could see each ache and pain on my body and watched them move through me.  By 4 am I was now hysterical and crying.  I was in so much unbearable pain and so scared.  I had to call off of work for this day.  I was so out of it I called my daughter off of school but also called for my mom to come get her and take her to school.  I kept my youngest home with me.  My head was still the absolute worst headache I have ever felt in my life.  I couldn?t open my eyes and it hurt to move at all.  I had to call a friend to come pick up my youngest daughter because I was unable to take care of her, I could barely stay awake and alert.  I tried another hot shower and everything still felt cold.  I was now nauseous from the head pain.  Around noon on this day I finally had the strength to drink some water and was able to take Tylenol.  I laid on the couch for hours still shivering and in unbearable pain.  I was still very scared that I was having such a bad reaction that I would die.  I called my husband to come home from work and be with me because I was scared.  I took more Tylenol a couple hours after the first dose.  Around 6 pm I started to feel better.  I was able to eat again that evening.  I had a headache though for about 3 weeks after that gradually weaned away.

The headache was constant throughout the day and night and it became severe on 03/31/2021 and I went to the ER. Was told that it was normal and due to the vaccine. I felt better for a few days and then I had the worse headache of my life on 04/11/2021. Went to the ER for the second time on 04/12/2021.  They didn&#39;t find anything abnormal in examination, was discharged home and was advised to contact my primary care provider.

                                                I started to feel chilled around 7pm friday evening. I laid down and began to feel nauseous and hot; my skin was sensitive. I soon had a 103.7 fever with chills and a terrible splitting headache. My symptoms lasted through the night. I took one 200mg Ibuprofen at 03:30 saturday morning/it didn&#39;t seem to help much. Most of the day saturday I had a headache that was manageable and 100.2 degree fever. Saturday evening I was fever free and had a dull headache. Sunday, I was exhausted.

Within a couple hours I had body aches, chills, congestion, &amp; dizziness became more severe. Within 3 hrs dizziness was debilitating &amp; I had to go home from work. Next day fever, congestion, &amp; body aches were gone. The dizziness was worse. I slept all day Sunday &amp; Monday thinking I would be better the next day. On Tuesday I was still very dizzy my mom convinced me to go to the doctor. The nurse from the doctor&#39;s office told me to go to immediate care, &amp; the doctor from immediate care sent me to the ER. I&#39;m still dizzy &amp; unable to work.

                                                Pain initially started 24-48 hours after the vaccine injection. Pain is at injection site, and surrounding area. Seems to be worsening since that time. She has tried over-the-counter Tylenol/Ibuprofen and topical Diclofenac gel with little to no relief of her pain. This is made daily living difficult. She also works as a daycare provider. She had some increased headaches 2-3 days after the vaccine, but these have seemed to resolve.

Patient notified this PCP&#39;s office with these symptoms on 4/13/21 at 10:28 at which time patient was referred to the hospital ER due to  6 known cases of women who had received Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine and developed rare type of blood clots and patient&#39;s above symptoms to rule out deep vein thrombus. At the hospital ER provider did physical exam and ordered lab which confirmed patient had no deep vein thrombus. Patient was discharged home with diagnoses of left calf pain and dyspepsia. Patient continues to have abdominal intermittently but left calf pain has been resolved.

                                                I was very ill on Friday night after receiving the vaccination. Flu-like symptoms, high fever, shortness of breath, pain in my abdomen, horrible headache, nausea, dizziness, loss of consciousness and leg pain (both legs). The flu-like symptoms passed on Saturday, but by Tuesday, April 13 I was continuing to have a terrible headache, abdominal pain and leg pain. I saw my primary doctor on the 13th and was sent over to the hospital for an ultrasound of my leg. No clots were found and I was told to continue trying to recover at home unless it got worse. I was seen at the emergency room on April 14th for abdominal pain, leg pain, dizziness and headache. The nurse told me I was probably hysterical over the vaccination being pulled, and I told him this was not the case. They performed CT (without contrast) on my abdomen and head, then released me with instructions to return if I was worse. By the 16th I was unable to walk as my left side was completely numb. I went back to the ER. I had a CT of my abdomen and head with and without contrast. I had a lumbar puncture and several labs. I was given IV antibiotics for some infection they found in my urine. I was given fluids and pain meds, and my BP was shooting up to 145/94 (which is very high for me), when standing. My vision was blurry and I was unable to remember much of the last week. I was admitted from the 16th through the 20th and had an MRV, 2 MRIs, more lab work and medicine for my headache. I was released on the 20th and the headache was unbearable and I was still numb on my left side, going back to my doctor on the 22nd. He suggested the ER, and the ER admitted me back to the stroke unit. I was released on the 22nd with a diagnosis of a hemiplegic migraine that could cause stroke-like symptoms (ZERO history of headaches previously). I was sent home with a walker and home health services. PT visited on April 30th and ordered two visits per week for the next month. I am unable to walk without a walker. I cannot shower or use the stairs without assistance. My memory is still foggy. I am unable to concentrate for long. I often stutter and can&#39;t remember basic words. I have also stopped and forgotten where I am at a given moment. I am on Depakote nightly for the headaches, and they have lessened slightly, but when they flare up it is debilitating and I often vomit. I have instructions to follow up with my primary tomorrow morning and see what the next steps are.

                                                Starting at about 05:00 in morning, I woke up feeling shaky and chilly. I was very achy. I had a fever. I took my temperature and it was 102 fever. I took Tylenol. (Extra Strength) I went back to sleep. I woke up about 08:00 am and I still had chills and was extremely achy and had a really bad headache. My temperature was 101.8. Then I started throwing up every 20 minutes for the whole entire day. I still had a fever. It was 102.6 at one point. I had been taking extra strength Tylenol as often as I could take it. I still had a headache was very very achy. I was throwing up constantly and couldn&#39;t get out of bed. I had my husband come home to take care of toddler. That lasted then for a full 28 hours - through the next evening. When I woke up on April 7 I had a light headache, a little achy but fever was gone. At the time of my vaccine, I was just 8 weeks pregnant. I had an ultrasound when I was seven weeks along they could hear the heartbeat. I had a miscarriage around 8 weeks and four days. It would have been about one day after the vaccine when I was having my reaction to the vaccine. I am still having bleeding from the DMC - removal - but otherwise I&#39;m recovered.  Pregnancy history - It was my second pregnancy. Estimated due date - November 15, 2021.

                                                I received my Janssen vaccine on 3/31/21.  On 4/29/21, I had a virtual appointment with a naturopath about a completely separate health issue (mold illness), and she asked me to check my blood pressure.  I checked my blood pressure using my father in law&#39;s at home cuff, and it was 149/99.  I continued to check over several days and had persistently elevated readings, ranging from 122-165/93-107.  My last known normal BP reading was in February of 2021 and was 110/70, which is my typical BP.  I had not checked my BP at any time between February and April because I had no reason to believe it would be elevated.  On 5/2/21, I had a reading of 165/107, which prompted me to go to the ER.  At the ER in triage, my BP was 188/144.  EKG was normal and troponin I was normal.  I was monitored for a few hours with BP around 155/100, and after a dose of Nadolol, my BP came down to 122/79.  I also had chest pain/tightness during this experience, which may have been due to anxiety.  My BP has continued to be persistently elevated (now coupled with anxiety about what is going on, which doesn&#39;t seem to be helping the numbers!), and I had to return to the ER on 5/5/21 after getting an at home reading of 180/122 (this was about 1 hour after taking a dose of Nifedipine).  At the ER triage, my BP had come down to 140/109, so they sent me home.  My BP has now remained elevated at around 135-140/95-100, while taking 30mg Nifedipine ER daily.

                                                I received the vaccine at 9am on Saturday, March 6th. My arm was immediately very sore throughout the day. Around 9:30pm that night I began to feel nauseous. As the night progressed my symptoms got worse. I experienced intense chills and by 11pm had a 100 degree fever. Sunday, March 7th my fever had decreased, but I continued to feel nauseous and have chills throughout the day. Additionally I felt extremely fatigued, weak, and had a throbbing headache. Completing simple tasks were difficult and exhausting. Monday, March 8th I continue to experience significant fatigue, headache, and muscle weakness, but at less intensity. Also, my right arm where I received the injection is very sore. I have also been somewhat dizzy today. I have been taking Advil, drinking fluids, using an ice pack, and resting as much as I can as part of the treatment.

                                                About 6 hours after receiving the Janssen shot, I came down with a fever, muscle aches and chills. My fever peaked at about midnight with a temperature of 101.8. At that point, I took two Tylenol. Had a rough night and didn&#39;t sleep well. Continued taking Tylenol the following day to manage the low grade fever. I seem to back mostly back to normal today (two days after receiving the vaccine), however I do still have soreness in my left arm where I got the shot and some residual aches and pains.

When I woke up two hours later I was freezing cold and my body was very achy. I ended up sleeping the rest of the day and night. On Friday I felt fine most of the day until about 10pm at night when I started having diarrhea. Throughout the night it got worse and my body got very hot to the point where I had to sleep naked with fans on me. I?m lightly short of breath, exhausted, and am still having diarrhea now (Sat).

Mom brought patient to me for assessment. When patient presented to me, patient was alert and vitals were normal. I asked patient to remain seated for 15 more minutes of observation.  Mom did say patient exhibited this behavior once before at the eye doctor.  I informed mom to please check with patients doctor for follow up. Patient exhibited some mental disability and thats is why the mother is involved. I dont believe patient is capable of taking care of herself.

Injection site was hot to the touch and did swell a bit. The following day I went through strong waves of feeling very ill and then feeling ok for about an hour, then back to having chills, nauseous, headache, body ache, and extremely lethargic. Half way through second day I broke out in a rash all over my chest, tummy, and back. Entering into day 3 ( today ) I do feel better, but can&#39;t shake the brain fog and feelings of being tired. Rash is still present currently.

It gets slightly better with tylenol.

                                                I received the vaccination 4/2/21 at 11am and at about 6pm the same day - I felt a sudden flush and felt like I was going to faint in the middle of Grocery store. Got very clammy and sweaty and weak - immediately left the store and started projectile vomiting outside the store and all night the first night. Had extremely joint/bone pain throughout my entire body for 4 days straight in bed, very weak, chills and night sweats, day 2 I had a little energy and drove about an hour and immediately started vomiting again  for day 2-day 5. Day 5 I woke up with swollen eye lids and hands and thought it was an allergic reaction to something in my house so took benedryl, but didn?t help. The swelling went down on day 6. I?ve had no energy and very foggy brain and been very down. My chest has felt like an anxiety attack 24/7 all week. I am on day 10 since the vaccination and my chest pain has increased. I still have foggy brain and been very out of it and weak still. I vomited day 1-day 5. Really bad pain in my hips and arm where I received the shot.

                                                The patient reported a pounding headache the morning after vaccination, localized to her right side above her eyebrow. She reported muscle weakness and general fatigue, an inability to focus and described feeling like she was &#34;drunk.&#34;  She began to have vision changes that affected just her right eye on 4/12/21 at 2:00 PM. She described it as blurriness and like looking through a kaleidoscope. The vision disturbances resolved 2 hours later after resting, but the headache remained. The only symptom that remains is the headache and it is improving and described as mild.

Back started to hurt and couldn&#39;t get comfortable. Then the whole body started to ache. Quickly the whole body and skin hurt and food and drink tasted bad. Started becoming cold and had to wrap a blanket around. Went to bed and had to take Tylenol every four hours to sleep. Woke up and body aches and feeling cold continued the rest of the day. There was also nausea and headaches on and of the whole day. Went back to work the following day but felt heavily nauseous for most of the day and couldn&#39;t eat or drink much of the day.

Almost 24 hours later I?m still experiencing cold chills. I also developed full body aches to where my bones feel like they are breaking and weak. Around 10 PM I started vomiting and that lasted for a couple of hours. At 2 AM a headache started and is still going on as of 9:46 AM. My bones pop and feel weak.  At other times my body will become extremely hot and soaked in sweat just to go back to cold chills.

After administration of the vaccine she appeared relieved afterwards and recieved a card with a note to wait for 15 minutes for any reactions. Her mother escorted her to her car, 10 minutes later, her mother came in saying &#34;she&#39;s having a seizure!&#34; We had a certified nurse that was administering the shots that went out to check on her and we had a technician call 911. Patient appeared disoriented in the car and clammy to touch. We checked her blood pressure, and the nurse reported it was a little low. After paramedics arrived was being treated as a vaso-vagal response and she was transported to the nearby hospital.

It was not an option so I wrote it in.  2 weeks after the shot I still have mild pain when breathing in and feel like I am winded more easily to the point that even before the vaccine was in the news I made an appointment with my doctor. He did EKG and D Dimer tests. Both came back normal but I still don?t feel myself.

                                                I have never had side effects to a vaccination before so it was completely unexpected  but it had been approximately 9 to 10 hours (which I had a hard time entering on the page prior where it asked me the times.i couldn&#39;t get it to okay how I had the time) but I had felt completely fine and normal directly after and that evening, but close to around 9 or 10 hours later I developed such a high fever so fast when I took it, it was 103.7 and i could barely stand up to get the thermometer i was SO weak and my whole body ached so bad. I couldn&#39;t stop crying I was so miserable and had to have my ex boyfriend come take care of me because I didnt have anyone else to, but it got so bad I was strongly considering going to the emergency room...I tried to sleep but my body was so restless. I took ibuprofen and it broke my fever but today I still feel achey and weak. I definitely wasn&#39;t expecting that because the guy that did mine said it&#39;s rare and if they do happen they are mild...I would consider my symptoms higher than mild. There  was nothing else that could caused it..everything was the same and the only different factor was the vaccine so I&#39;m 100% sure that it was the cause.

                                                Approximately 5 hours after the vaccine I developed a very bad headache followed by chills, sweats, congestion, chest pain, body pain, muscle pain, fatigue and fever. The muscle pain and weakness was so bad I would loose balance when walking. I then started to menstruate clots, not my normal cycle timing,  which lasted about 2 days. The clots subsided but I am still bleeding today. I was in bed for 4 days with severe immune response symptoms. After those symptoms subsided the fatigue was so extreme it was hard to function.

                                                About 12 hours after the shot I experienced chills, fever and headache lasting about 36 hours.  Since then I have had incredible headaches almost daily, lasting a few hours (I have been taking Tylenol for the headaches).  Usually headaches are after 5pm, I will feel dizzy, foggy, and intense pressure, some blurred vision. I do not have a history of migraines or headaches, I have been taking the Tylenol, drinking lots of water, and taking baths to try and help with them.

                                                The night of the vaccination I woke up in the middle of the night with a severe cramp in my calf muscle. The following day I still had more cramps in my right leg and foot for 48 hours. I also felt very fatigued. I went to see my doctor six days after vaccination, and she did blood work which came back normal. I am still feeling fatigue after two weeks it is a constant feeling of tiredness.

                                                patient was treated with the Janssen/Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 adenovirus vaccine on Saturday April 10, 2021 and she relates having had symptomatic problems since that time stating prior to administration of the vaccine she was in her normal state of health.  She relates that on the evening of April 10 she had chills but otherwise no other major symptoms and the next day felt fine as well as during that week.  However she states that starting 1 week later on Saturday, April 17 she began feeling poorly characterized by a recurrence of hives that she has had in the past along with a sore throat.  She states this occurred while she was at work and describes the sore throat as unusual from prior sore throat she has had in the past with a description of a globus-like sensation along with some difficulties swallowing for more pressure than overt pain.  She attempted salt water gargles without benefit.  The rash was the characteristic hives rash that she has had on 2 prior occasions with rapid development of itchy red lesions scattered throughout especially in her proximal extremities and torso region.  She relates the hives worsened on Sunday, April 18 essentially from &#34;head to toe&#34; although not actually involving her face.  She also related new accompanying symptoms including diffuse arthralgias, stiffness and swollen painful muscles and joints.  This was throughout her entire body and somewhat of a migratory nature involving all of her major joints including the hands, wrists, shoulders, feet, ankles, knees and hips.  She states that because of the severity of symptoms she had an urgent care appointment on Sunday, April 18 and felt to have a exacerbation of urticaria for which she was prescribed montelukast, loratadine cimetidine and a Solu-Medrol Dosepak.  She states she was unable to fill the Solu-Medrol Dosepak initially but took the other medications without relief and then presented to the emergency room here at Hospital on Monday, April 19 where she had an evaluation which was largely unremarkable other than laboratory testing with a nonspecific elevation in inflammatory markers including a CRP of 5.7, ESR 34 and white blood count 15.92.  She was notably COVID-19 negative at that time as well as Monospot negative.  She was discharged home and ended up filling the Solu-Medrol Dosepak which she took and noted some improvement in her hives but has been continue to experience this ongoing sore throat, arthralgias, myalgias and diffuse swelling which is quite painful.  She specifically relates &#34;every time I use a muscle it seems to inflame.&#34;

                                                During my menstrual cycle I usually have no symptoms other than tender breasts. So these symptoms were very unusual. Leg pains, pain and pressure in pelvis, clitoral pain, pain around vaginal opening, stinging like acid during urination that sent a shock through my entire body, uncontrollable bladder, nausea, large blood clots, lower stomach pain, flank pain, hot/cold chills, if I touch my belly button the pain radiated to my vagina, ovaries hurt, cervix pain, dryness, unable to get comfortable, crawling out of my skin, and constant urge to urinate, depression.  I landed myself in the ER where they told me to take Tylenol and Motrin and sent me on my way. These medications were not able to control the amount of pain I was in. I have now reached out to a couple specialists.

                                                Three days the vaccine I got very short of breath with confusion, dizziness and light headed and disoriented.  I felt like there was pressure in my chest and I had some brain fog. I felt like I had water in my lungs. My right arm bicep was contracting and twitching. I had Vertigo which made it very hard to sit down without feeling off balance. I was unable to drive. I tried to hope it would pass but I went to the ER on 4/14/2021. The dizziness was getting worse after five days and the pressure on my chest was unbearable. I was advised to drink some water and take Tylenol.  My blood pressure was lower than normal. I finally felt better on 4/21/2021. I could finally get out of bed and not feel like I was going to fall down. I could not drive for about two and a half weeks. I still feel a little out of breath and my brain is a little foggy but it has gotten a little better.

However, starting 04/28/21 patient began experiencing full body itching. The only recent change was immunization. Patient is unsure if vaccination is the cause of the itching but wanted to report just in case. Patient is without a primary care provider currently and went to an urgent care center after a sleepless night 04/30/21 due to itching. The urgent care prescribed something for the itching but patient didn&#39;t feel she was taken seriously with concerns about vaccination. Patient will try to follow up with previous primary care provider in the future.

                                                My top and bottom lips developed blisters on Friday afternoon and by Saturday they began to weep. They them became crusty and swollen. Over the next few days they continued to weep. They stopped weeping and were crusty, and then the crust came off on the Wednesday after it began. My lips were still sore and sensitive, but were back to normal about 10 days later. Doctor prescribed an antiviral (vircyclovir) for cold sore but I don&#39;t think it was a cold sore. I actually did develop a cold sore on my bottom lip 2 weeks after the initial lip issue.

Hard to sleep that night because I was so achy. By the morning I had a fever of 99 (never went higher than that), headache, sore joints and muscles that lasted through the whole day/felt like a mild flu. Waking up on 3/28/21 (day two after shot) my low grade fever was gone and symptoms are mostly gone. Just a slightly sore arm.

Second day symptoms worsened, feeling like I was going to pass out/faint, hot/cold chills, clammy, no fever, shortness of breath, culminating in numbness and tingling in arms, legs, then chest and then hands freezing up which resulted in a panic attack. Have never had a panic attack before. Emergency services called and after checking gave a sedative and went to the ER.

                                                It started around 11:12 PM and it really hit me hard. I was not able to sleep the whole night it is currently 4 PM the next day and I?m still experiencing the exact same symptoms as what I was last night which is chills causing me to sweat through T-shirts unable to sleep, extreme discomfort, my arm hurts at the injection site, but the main issue is the body aches, extreme headache,Extreme nauseousness to the point where I feel like I need to throw up but I cannot and all around flu like symptoms. AlthoughI feel as though I have a fever I have checked it a few times and I do not. It has not let up at all since last night I am only able to sleep in 30 to an hour increments

She was flushed, her face was pale, patient was alert and communicating. She was really dizzy, so I had her lay on the floor. Requested my technician to get get wet towels and wiped patient&#39;s face. Within 3-4 mins she was feeling much better. But still dizzy. Had her take a few sips of Gatorade and remain laying on the floor for about 45 mins

                                                Brain fog approximately one hour post vaccine. Approximately 4 hours after the vaccine, chills started, approximately one hour after chills (5PM) temperature began to rise. After taking temperature, it was 103.8 degrees Fahrenheit. Took tylenol to attempt to lower temperature, however it did not minimize temperature significantly. In addition to the fever, the onset of intense migraine and severe dizziness occured. Took a second dose of tylenol and the temperature did not reduce- and raised to 104.9 degrees fahrenheit. I was unable to sleep the night the vaccine was administered as my head was throbbing and spinning so intensely. I may have had an increased  heart rate- which likely prevented my body from being able to settle, despite other side effects. I also had loss of appetite due to fever, and was able to eat normally until approximately 2 days after the vaccine. The fever broke approximately 24 hours later, however fatigue set in afterwards and lasted through the following week (felt mostly normal the Thursday after receiving the shot 3/18/2021).

                                                My shot was around 12 noon. I didn&#39;t eat before so they gave me crackers and juice at the site. Afterwards I ate a real meal and two hours later I got dizzy. It was tolerable.  At 9:30 PM I got a fever. Then I felt pressure all over my body, pressing me down; I felt so heavy I could barely move. That&#39;s when my joints started to ache and I had piercing pain in my right knee and the bones in both hands. Then I got really dehydrated. No matter how much water I drank, it wasn&#39;t enough. Then I got chills, then a headache. It felt like I had sold my soul to Satan and he was sucking it out through my limbs, very slowly. I thought I might be an anomaly that died from a bad reaction. I tried to sleep so I wouldn&#39;t feel the pain anymore. That attempt took 3 hrs. The next day my migraine and joint soreness persisted. I felt so weak I didn&#39;t get up for hours. Thr second night I still felt unquenchingly dehydrated. Third day I only felt soreness in my arm from the actual shot.

                                                I woke up 12 hours after I got the vaccine with dizziness, nausea, chills, and joint pain. The dizziness got progressively worse (so much so I had to call into work) with the worst dizziness peaked about 18 hours post vaccine. All symptoms resolved within 36 hours post vaccine. The dizziness felt different than my chronic migraine dizziness. I was more disoriented and it was difficult to stand or walk long distances. I had to lay flat most of the day until symptoms resolved.

My body felt very hot but I was still cold. Went to bed without taking any pain relief. I woke up at 2 AM, took Tylenol and went back to sleep. I woke up again at 3 AM, felt very hot and turned on my fan. When I woke up in the morning at 7:30 AM, my body still aches and I still had a headache. I took more Tylenol. Headache went away but for the rest of the day I felt very lethargic, a little foggy in my brain, slightly achy. I took Tylenol again when I went to bed at 9 PM and when I woke up at 4 AM the next morning I felt better. All symptoms are gone.

Our symptoms began in less than an hour after receiving the vaccine. My fuzziness and neurological symptoms began in the 15 minute observation window. My fiancé is began approximately 40 minutes later. We proceeded to go home eat something small, and sleep for the next 26 hours straight

Heating pad and blankets until vomiting and diarrhea started around 6pm. This continued many times throughout the night until about 8am the next morning  when I finally self medicated with Zofran to try to stop the dry heaving. I took 3 doses of zofran throughout the day to keep from vomiting more. Diarrhea slowly subsided throughout the day. I slept for 2 days straight afterwards.

                                                Yesterday at 11am I began to experience severe, high (under rib cage) abdominal cramping and a headache. I fell asleep at approx 1pm and woke up around 4pm with less cramping and a dull headache. The headache continued throughout the evening. I had diarrhea on and off. Each time I stood up I felt faint and lethargic, leading me to spend the rest of the night in bed. Today, my body feels sore and lethargic and my mind feels foggy and tired.

She went to Dr. to have a physical since she was feeling so bad.  They did blood work and everything came out fine.  She is going back to the doctor to show them the rash since she forgot to show him when she was there to get her physical.  She is applying alcohol rub which seems to be helping.  All of her symptoms have subsided excluding her rash.

However, 5 days after vaccination I awoke with dizziness and fatigue. The dizziness was strong enough that I was unable to work and spent the day sleeping. I contacted my doctor and went in for a visit the next Day. No cause for the dizziness and fatigue was determined, but up one further reflection it is possible that it was a vaccine side effect which is why I?m reporting it here. The dizziness and fatigue was better the next day and completely gone two days later.

On the third day I had a slight headache in the morning. I then got a significant nosebleed, and my right leg was painful. On the fourth day I tried to work out and I felt lightheaded and got some chest pain and tightness with shortness of breath. I seemed to bruise easily. I was advised to see my doctor and I went to the ER. I followed up with my doctor and she advised that there were no signs of blood clots.

                                                I had normal side effects like the flu twelve hours after. The following day I had really bad anxiety and insomnia and my period came early. I could not sleep and I was very anxious. I was very scared and jumpy and restless for no reason. The news of the vaccine safety issues had not been released yet. I went to the ER and I was given anxiety medication. It lasted for a week and I could not sleep at all. I got my period three days after the vaccine and that was three weeks early and it was lighter than normal.. I normally have regular periods. My anxiety has been better and I am sleeping normally.

                                                The night of 3/9/21  following the vaccination I had fever, chills, sweating, severe body aches and pains (all over) and nightmares Wednesday morning I was unable to go to work and remained in bed sleeping all but approximately 2 hours in the afternoon  because I was still in pain and had headache/fever/chills/muscle and joint pain. I also had no appetite. I was awake long enough to eat one bowl of cereal and a small apple sauce cup so that I could take more meds without upsetting my stomach. Wednesday night 3/10 my temperature was still at 99.3. I was still having body soreness and headaches (sinus). Thursday morning 3/11 I still had the headache and body soreness but no more fever. I was still feeling unwell but could at least get out of bed and function. By late Thursday most of the symptoms subsided and I started feeling better. Friday morning I was no longer having symptoms.  It was the initial symptoms Tuesday night and Wednesday that concerned me the most because it hit me so severely and fast. The pharmacist warned me of possible side effects that would require over the counter medication, but in my case that did not suffice. I was physically unable to do anything but sleep which is highly unusual for me, and my entire body was in more pain than I?ve ever experienced.

                                                At the time of my vaccine I was 30 weeks pregnant. My expected date of delivery is 5/18/21 and I have had no issues/complications with this pregnancy.   I received my vaccine on 3/9  at 4:00 PM, and stayed to be monitored for  30 minutes due to my pregnancy, After the vaccine, Per the clinics recommendation, I drank lots of fluids the rest of the day. Several hours later I noticed I had a minor headache. I Consulted with my OBGYN and took 650mg of Tylenol before going to bed. By midnight when I layed down(and throughout the remainder of the night - till about 7am) I had moderate body aches - especially in my legs. I also felt feverish with chills and at times sweating, but had no actual fever. I checked on three sperate occasions between 12AM and 7AM. I was unable to sleep that night.   The following day (3/10) I felt tired, had some lingering body aches (though not as bad as the night before) and a minor headache that would come and go throughout the day. I also had minor arm pain at the injection site - nothing different then a flu shot. continued to drink lots of fluids and took  Tyelnol as needed.   When I woke up on 3/11, I felt perfectly fine. No headache, body aches, arm pain, etc.

I had sweatpants, two sweatshirts, slippers and 2 blankets on to help. Later on I had fallen asleep to wake my husband to uncontrollable laughter and crying, mentally I knew what I was doing was not right but I couldn&#39;t control it. I believe my feve may had spiked so high that it was border line hysteria. By morning I woke and the fever had broke however I still had no appetite, terrible headache along with weakness and fatigue....I also tried food but ended up spitting it out because everything tasted strongly of metal. Sunday I was back to tasting to food and more energy.

Soon after she laid on the floor and started crying and saying her hands were cramping and in pain.  She also stated she was very nauseous and felt like she was going to throw up.  Pts husband agreed that we should call an ambulance which we did.  When paramedics arrived pt was feeling better and refused a ride to the ER.  Pt&#39;s husband took her to the car and drove her to the ER.

I got hot and sweaty and horrible tunnel vision, I almost fainted. I laid down on one of their medical beds to recover while the sweet nurse fanned me.  I was observed over 30 min before leaving.  I woke up yesterday and felt weird along with bodyaches, chills, joint pains, random stinging sensations throughout my body (almost like a pen prick), sporadic short headaches and muscle cramps.  I left work yesterday and didn?t even go in today.

Took an Epsom salt bath at 6:30pm. At 8pm got hit with chills, fever of 100F, entire neck and back started to ache and have pain, mild headache, and both hands and fingers felt weak and had a burning sensation. Took another 500mg Tylenol then laid down and fell asleep around 9pm. Woke up at 11pm drenched in sweat with same symptoms. Changed into dry clothes and woke up again around 3am drenched in sweat again, but fever was gone. Woke up on April 9 feeling lethargic, a tire body was achy and sore and had a headache. Fever never came back and the weakness and burnings ends ruin in hands was gone as were the chills. Throughout the day I rested and had physical therapy to loosen my muscles in my neck and back.

                                                I experienced tiredness a couple hours after receiving the vaccine. Shortly after, body ache set in. The following morning, I woke up with body ache and developed a headache soon after. The headache lasted all day. It became difficult to focus on anything else. I remember I couldn&#39;t even look at my phone screen because it hurt to do so. At times, I felt like the room was spinning around me. Later that night, I checked my temperature and had a slight fever, but it was only a degree or so higher than my normal temperature. I also experienced some chills throughout the evening. I went to bed early that night and woke up feeling like a brand new person with no remaining symptoms.

                                                A few minutes after the injection I felt strange sensations in my arms. About half an hour after the injection started feeling a little dizzy and tightness in chest and throat. Later in the evening I had mild flu like symptoms, chills aches. The following morning was a Sunday and was feeling better but later that day throat started hurting. Throat progressively became swelled and irritated and extremely sore. Flu like symptoms returned. Throat was swelled and to the peak of pain on Monday night. Tuesday morning I was seen at a clinic and it was a little bit better. It started getting better after that but also it has now been a week and a half and throat is still a little bit irritated. I also have brown splotches that appeared on my face either the night of the vaccine or the morning that have not went away.

                                                On Thursday, April 8, 2021, between 915 and 945 AM, I received the Janssen/Johnson &amp; Johnson single dose COVID-19 Vaccine. As I have had adverse reactions to vaccines in the past, I was advised to wait at the vaccination site for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, and I did. Approximately 2 hours after receiving the vaccine in my left arm, I developed a red lacey-type rash all over my body. (This rash still persists today, Tuesday, April 13, 2021 at 3:37 PM and is relieved temporarily with consistent doses of Benadryl capsules, liquid or tablets.)  On Thursday night (April 8), after receiving the vaccine, I began to have body aches and to feel fatigued around 7:30 PM. I took 50 mg Benadryl, 500 mg acetaminophen, 800mg ibuprofen and went to bed. I woke around 12:30 AM and was drenched in sweat and my clothes were wet with sweat. I urinated and went back to bed and was shivering uncontrollably from the time I got out of bed until I got back in the bed and bundled up?it was several minutes before the shivering stopped and I went back to sleep. At approximately 2 AM, I woke up to urinate again. I had a terrible headache, like my head was in a vice; my tongue, throat, and nasal passages were very swollen, and it was difficult to breathe through my nose at all. I took an additional 50 mg of Benadryl and a 500mg acetaminophen and went back to bed. On Friday morning I woke to a phone call from work checking on me. I had slept through all of my alarms and it was 8:35 AM. I was unable to report to work that day and went back to sleep and slept for most of the day, only getting up occasionally to get a drink and use the bathroom. That evening I was able to get up and do a few things with the children and run to the grocery store, however, I became very fatigued and went to bed early without eating dinner.  On Saturday morning, when I woke up, I realized that I had slept for over 12 hours. I was groggy and fatigued all day and had a nap in the afternoon. That evening I was able to participate in family movie night and was feeling ok until about 10 PM. At that time, I began to feel very nauseated and had diarrhea, even though I had not eaten anything that would upset my stomach. I had intense abdominal cramping and felt like I would vomit if I moved around too much. I went to bed and had to get up to use the bathroom with diarrhea at least twice after the initial symptoms at about 10 PM.  On Sunday morning, I woke up after sleeping approximately 10 hours and was able to get up without feeling too fatigued. I did chores and errands and began to feel fatigued in the afternoon and took a nap for about 2 hours. That evening I also had to rush to the bathroom with diarrhea, however, there was no nausea. I went to bed at about 10 PM. On Monday morning, when I woke up, I felt very groggy and did not feel like I had gotten enough sleep. By the evening on Monday, however, I had begun to feel a little less fatigued and more clear-headed. As of Tuesday, April 13, 2021, I have had the red lacey-looking rash intermittently since having the vaccine. I am already on several OTC allergy medications for seasonal allergies and continue to take those medications, however, I have increased my Benadryl intake from 25 mg in the morning to 50 mg in the mornings with 25 -50 mg every 6 hours or so, as well. The rash improves for a short time while I am taking the Benadryl, but it reappears within a few hours after taking the Benadryl.

                                                Once my vaccine was administered I felt tingling on my tongue and bottom lip. I waited the 15 minutes and felt that the tingling was diminishing. I spoke to the tech and felt ok to leave since I was not experiencing loss of breath or swelling. After about 3 hours I noticed the tingling sensation coming back. I immediately called the pharmacist who administered the shot. After explaining the tingling was mostly felt on my lips and tongue but had no swelling and could breath and swallow just fine. I explained that it felt like when you get a shot for Dental work and that every time I touched the area it would tingle more. He told me that was not a normal reaction and would call in a few hours to check in on me. Sometime around 7 we spoke again and I still had no changes with the tingling. Again, he said he would have the pharmacist who was in call again the next day to make sure I was ok. By 11:30pm the aches in my joints started and I had chills. I woke up for work at 3:25am and noticed the tingling sensation wasn&#39;t as strong as the day before. Once I ate the tingling became more noticeable and was mostly on the right side of my tongue and throat. I also started experiencing a headache and sinus pressure. After arriving I work by 6am I felt exhausted. As the day went on the exhaustion  was becoming so strong I felt that I was fighting to keep my eyes open. The aches in my joints were becoming more intense especially in my hips and hands. At times I felt it hard to hold anything in my hand as closing my fingers became so painful it brought tears to my eyes. I also notice I was sweating profusely but had no fever. Once I was home I took a 2 hour nap. I woke up feeling the same the tingling in my mouth, aches still noticeable and headache still there. I could not stand and even tried to eat but had a loss of appetite. I called the pharmacy and reported the tingling was still noticeable. The pharmacist on duty explained the aches were normal but the tingling was not. I was advised to seek medical attention if I had trouble breathing or had swelling. The pharmacist told me to keep up on rest and fluids and I would recieve another call tomorrow to see how I was feeling. It&#39;s now 9:28pm and there are no changes to the tingling sensation in my mouth/throat. I still have aches and pains that are radiating throughout my body. My headache is still there but not as strong as this morning and I now have ringing in my ears. Every once in awhile I get some good stomach pains but they last a minute or two before going away.

About 3 days ago I started getting a major headache on the right side that also arrived with blurry vision, mental fog and mild dizziness. Nausea yesterday and today except the headache was much worse. I cried from the pain and this is when I became more concerned. My eyes, mainly the right side and a pressure in my sinuses were very difficult to bare with, subsided some with multiple doses of ibuprofen and Advil sinus but not by much. The headache is unbearable, painful to stand out bend over or move.

                                                My right shoulder joint on the side of the shot started to hurt within a week of getting of the shot. It was very painful, and I had problems moving my arm and carrying my tools. I went to Urgent care and I have been referred to an Orthopedic specialist. I have lost the range of motion in that arm and I can?t lay down on my side. I have never had any problems since I injured that shoulder 20 years ago as a kid. I take an Aleve or Tylenol  if I need to but it does not really help with the pain.

                                                On March 13th, 2021 I was given the opportunity to receive the Janssen Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid 19 vaccine so I decided to go ahead and get vaccinated.  Within 1.5 hours of receiving the vaccine, I began to feel unwell. It started with my left leg going numb. From there symptoms continued to increase. I got very tired could hardly stay awake. Then the chills hit. I could not get warm.  By the next morning (Sunday day 2) I had developed a low fever, headache, body aches and whole body weakness. I could still hardly stay awake still. When I was awake, I was very dizzy and I felt like everything around me was moving but I was not. My left leg still felt numb but I thought it would pass on its own.. Because of how I felt, I just laid around and rested. My injection site was swollen, Red and extremely hot to touch.  Next comes Monday (day 3), I got up that morning, still not feeling well. I made my way to work. That did not go well. The more I moved, the worse I felt. I was completely unbalanced and looked like I was drunk. I couldn&#39;t walk straight, I had to randomly grab onto chairs and sit down. I was feeling weaker by the minute. I left work at that point and went to see my primary physician that afternoon. At this point I could see straight to drive myself, could hardly walk as my left leg now dragged. I had no balance and having lots of dizzy spells at this point. He suggested I head to th ER but eventually decided we could wait until morning to see if things improved at all. If no improvement,  I was to go to ER. Tuesday Morning (day 4), my husband took me to the emergency room. I had reached the point of not being able to walk unassisted. At this point, the weakness and numbness I had on my left, had spread to my right side. We had no idea what was happening. We got right in and discussed what was going on. What lead up to me being there, etc. The ER ran blood work, xrays of my chest and 3 different MRIs trying to figure out if something happened like a stroke. NOTHING was present on any test they did yet there was something obviously wrong with me. My arm was still very Red and hot.. I had developed a lump in my arm where the vaccine was given. After ruling out everything the doctor could think of, he consulted with the on call neurologist since it was obvious to him something was happening with my neurological system. The diagnosis...my body was taking the vaccine as a toxin causing my neurological system to react and shut down. They felt that I should be starting feel better in the next few days as the vaccine settles into my system. I was told to follow up with a neurologist and my primary. I was then discharged from the hospital in the condition I had arrived.  Wednesday (day 5) I spent the day at home, not able to do anything. I napped most of the day. I still felt like crap and had no idea when I would start feeling better. No improvement that day.  Thursday (day 6) I woke up feeling a bit better. My right side was beginning to feel normal again but I was still feeling weak and unbalanced. This is also the day I meet with a neurologist to follow up. I don&#39;t know that this appointment had accomplished much as she didn&#39;t have access to all my medical records. She ended up prescribing me a medication to help with nerve pain I was having in my left side and referred me to do physical therapy. I am to follow up in 2 months.  Friday (day 7) my right side is back to pre-vaccine stage. My left is not. I feel pretty good except the occasional dizzy spell and the fact my left isn&#39;t working yet.  Day 8 and beyond...I&#39;m feeling ok. I went back to work but still have issues with my left side and residual dizzy spells. I began physical therapy 2 days a week to work on strengthening my left side however it has yet to help.  I am now just over 4 weeks post covid vaccine. I am now using a cane to help me walk as my left side has still not returned to normal. It is unknown if it will. I&#39;m in Physical therapy 2x a week still. The lump at injection site is now the size of a pea. I still have moments of unbalanced feeling and dizzy spells.

I took extra strength Tylenol with some water and a banana and vomitted less than 10 minutes later.  I took some more Tylenol and was able to finally get some sleep. The next two days I felt very tired and a little dizzy so I just rested.  Two weeks later I am having sinus pain (no congestion), headaches, nausea and dizziness.

The following day, still felt fatigued and had spells of feeling foggy/disassociated, ?out of it.? Unsure if this reaction was due to the medication or not.

Became very disoriented &amp; confused, had trouble processing things, had trouble talking, felt dizzy for about 30 minutes.   After 30 minutes, it slowly diminished and I felt more myself within an hour. (although still had the typical affects from the vaccine: bad nausea &amp; fatigue, slight fever &amp; aches).

I continue to take Tylenol every 6 hours until persists as directed by the RN that administered the vaccine.   Some side effects have lessened, others have not, and the rest seem to be slightly dissipating.

                                                The day of the vaccine I was told that my arm might be sore. I felt sore right away and as soon as I got in the car to drive home I was extremely tired and I slept for the entire six hour car ride home. I was very fatigued that night and then I got a bad headache, fever and it lasted for 48 hours. After that, the headache was less intense and they were intermittent but my arm still hurt and I couldn&#39;t lay on it. I was still fatigued for a week. On the fourth day I started to get a weird feeling of vibrations and twitching all over my body. It is especially worse in my temple. It has been a month but I still get the twitching in different parts of my body. My face, arms, legs and temples. It is in different places. It happens less often now, it is not all day but it is still daily and mostly in my head and my legs. I had it happen in my temples last night.  I had my menstrual cycle since the vaccine and it was about three days later than expected. I had a lot of blood clots which was unusual for me. I have had flu like symptoms this week and I have a cough, runny nose and headaches but I am planning on trying to go to the doctor this week.

I drifted off to sleep all right around 10:30, but by midnight, my legs were on fire like I?d just run a marathon. I?m pretty sure I had a fever because I was sweating and tossing and turning for what seemed like hours. By 4:00, I had a massive headache and felt like I was going to throw up. I took Advil and Zofran at 4 and went back to bed. Sunday I still battled headache, aches, and fatigue. The fatigue is what&#39;s still lingering yesterday and today.

                                                Within 9 hours I had fever, chills, fatigue. When I woke up the next morning both of my eyes were swollen. I took ceterizine and Benadryl with no relief. I missed the following Monday of work due to my eyes still be swollen. My lips started swelling by Wednesday. Only one side of my upper lip would swell at a time or one side of my lower lip. By they following Saturday my lips were still swelling at any given time. Monday March 29 my  bottom lip started swelling at 1:45 pm and by 2:30 pm both eyes were swollen. I had tremendous pain behind my left eye which caused me to go to the Emergency room. I was given IV meds and had prescriptions ons waiting for me at the pharmacy the next day. My eyes were still swollen the following Tuesday the 30th. I am on a steroid and to antihistamines to help prevent this from happening again along with Benadryl, ibuprofen for pain.

Patient then ate a snickers bar in her purse and felt better, stating she must have felt uneasy because she had not eaten and was also a bit anxious after getting her shot. Patient walked out of the pharmacy at the end of her observation period saying she felt fine and was going home. Upon calling the patient 12 hours later on her cell to see how she was doing, the patient said she was fine, and no change since she left the pharmacy this morning.

My arm was immediately tingly and numb simultaneously, and I felt...light and weird. Around 2p, I began feeling feeling lightheaded and weak, and at 6p, I had chills, severe weakness, dizziness and nausea. I couldn&#39;t stand up longer than 2 minutes without wanting to vomit and faint. I couldn&#39;t even stand up long enough to wash dishes, prepare a bowl of grapes to eat or shower. Throughout the night, I sweated so terribly from the chills to the point that my bed was soaked to the mattress pad, and currently at 2:02p on April 6th, I&#39;m still experiencing the extreme weakness, nausea, and chills.

                                                Approximately 9 hours after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA, I experienced sudden fatigue followed by onset of severe muscle and joint pain including severe head pain followed by severe chills followed by fever and excessive sweating. I was very dizzy and felt disoriented. I was in bed when all this happened and was already wearing warm clothes under the covers. The muscle and joint pain was so severe, I couldn&#39;t grip anything including my cell phone (my wrists were in sharp pain). The head pain was so severe I was sensitive to light regardless of how dim it was. I felt like my toes were curled, but that could have been me &#34;bracing&#34; and tightening up due to the total body pain. I could move very little. It was very strange. These symptoms persisted through the night. The following morning at around 9am, I still had a very bad headache that made me nauseated and continued to be sensitive to light. Some of the joint and muscle pain tapered down enough for me to get out of bed to go potty but it was exhausting to walk 5 feet to the bathroom and then get back in bed. I still ran a mild fever. At around 1pm I took a Tylenol that helped subside the symptoms but felt wiped out all day. By the following day (Monday), I was feeling better getting more energy and by that Monday evening, I felt like nothing ever happened. I&#39;m sure these just fall into perhaps the more severe level of the side effects, but I was frightened by the intense sharp muscle and joint pain to the point I couldn&#39;t even grip anything.

About 10 minutes after the shot, she came back to the pharmacy and reported she was not feeling right.  She was extremely tired, weak, and dizzy.  She was told to sit down for further observation and given a bottle of water.  About 5 minutes later, she said she was still feeling really bad.  She said she was not thinking clearly and didn&#39;t feel right. She was also experiencing moderate pain down her spine.  She said her thinking was so affected that she wanted to seek treatment.   Patient declined offer to call EMS, and proceeded to an urgent care clinic next door.  Urgent care later called the pharmacy to inform us that patient had been transported to the hospital by ambulance.

                                                After the shot, when I was waiting in the monitoring lot, I felt intense pain in my arm and it made my muscles tense all through my neck. I also got dizzy and lightheaded. The girl in the car next to me had waved over one of the attendants as well because she was feeling weird too. I got home and had the worst headache I&#39;ve ever had and felt flu like symptoms and very weak. The next day at work I was so sick I had to go home. I was puking and had diarrhea  over and over for a few hours. I also felt lightheaded and dizzy and weak. Also had the headache. I was getting chills as well once I got home. Today I just feel very weak and just &#34;off&#34;.

Took my temperature and was running a slight fever at 99.0 degrees.  Took Tylenol extra strength as a fever reducer.

                                                Immediately after I got it I felt different. Fight or flight response kicked in. My heart started racing and chest felt tighter. It felt like I just ran a marathon. My breathing increased and I felt very dizzy and lightheaded. I stayed in the store and walked around hoping symptoms wouldn&#39;t get worse for 25 minutes then left. I had my three small children with me and wanted to get them home. I called my husband who is a physician and told him everything I was experiencing. He told me to stay in the store to see how things went. I then drove home to monitor my symptoms. I had post nasal drip and it exacerbated over the next few weeks. I was on two different antibiotics because it felt like I had a bad ear infection. It never went away. I saw an ENT and my tympanaplasty that I had as a child blew. I have a large hole in my ear drum currently and very dizzy. I am getting a CT of my ear this Wednesday and I will have to have surgery in the next few months for another tympanoplasty.

Because it would make me more nauseated.  Terrible headache I fell asleep earlier in the afternoon I had to hold my Stomach and even turning in bed led to more nausea.  Finally fell asleep  dor the night woke up so far today I don?t feel nauseated I do feel dehydrated and I tried to drink Gatorade but drinking  from a cup aggravates it so only like ice chips or popsicles don?t aggravate my stomach    I felt like I was dying just laying on the floor for hours I laid on the. Ahg room floor because the tile was cool and I was near the toilet.  I tested positive for covid asymptomatic in October and then positive again in December with mild symptoms.  I never fully regained sense of smell or taste only partially even though that was months ago.  I wouldn?t wish that vaccine reaction in anyone   I was hesitant sins with already had covid to get vaccinated but was encouraged to do so.  I definitely won?t do that again ever.  It wasn?t that bad actually having COVID that was way worse.

These effects lasted for two hours, then I had anxiety and trouble sleeping for rest of night.  The headache carried on into the morning and became severe. Upon taking Advil, the pain drastically decreased. I had a mild headache, along with fatigue, a little queasy after eating and an unpleasant spacey/dizzy/heady feeling for the rest of the day.  By morning of the 9th, all effects ceased.

I felt a little nauseous, and my gut was upset. I had chills, fever, and then began to have painful muscle aches on my backside. My sleep was significantly disrupted - I woke up at midnight two nights in a row after my fever broke, then had disrupted sleep the whole rest of the night, waking up at least once an hour, the second night in significant pain from muscle aches. I didn&#39;t feel well enough to get out of bed for about 40 hours, would get chills if I got up for more than a couple minutes. I began to feel better second morning after symptoms began, took two Tylenol, then improved  rapidly  with no further side effects.

                                                I took the vaccine at 4:25pm on April 7. On April 8 at 4am, I started feeling sick, chills, feet was cold, a lot of pain on my body, headache, couldnt sleep. I took Ibuprofen 800 and 1 hour later I was feeling a little better. I was able to sleep. When I woke up I was fine. Around 11am on April 8 I started feeling very sick again. I had diarrhea all day.   Evacuated about 10 times during the day. I felt dizzy, nauseas, no fever, pain on my arm, heavy shoulders, back pain, head was lightweight. I took ibuprofen at 12pm and then 8pm. I was able to sleep from April 8 to April 9 and woke up without severe symptoms, only arm pain.

                                                As the vaccine was being administered into my left deltoid, the vaccine hurt at the injection site and I immediately felt very strange and felt a rushing sensation to my head and throughout my body, with a concentration in my upper body.  It felt like an out of body experience: I fainted, hitting my head on the adjacent wall and fell to the ground, where the impact caused a bruise to my shoulder and back.  It was reported to me that I lost consciousness for about 10 seconds.  I felt disoriented, but lucid when I came to.  I was not exactly sure what happened, but I could feel that I hit my head on the right side and asked if I fainted since I was disoriented and on the floor.  With assistance, I was able to sit back on the bench, but felt extremely dizzy, light headed, fuzzy/strange type of blurry vision, and intense sweating.  I did not feel well and knew I would have an unsteady gait if I attempted to stand.  After about 15 minutes, I felt well enough to return home.

Administered the vaccine, gave the patient and her timer, she sat down to be observed. Before her 15 min. was up, she said she was clammy, hot and felt faint. We offered to call an ambulance. She did not want one.  We layed her down in the floor, with legs elevated, took her bp 117/73 (normal), but she was hot. Got her a cold pack and she placed it on her forehead. She layed in the floor for several minutes, but said the cold pack made her feel much better. Waited, we asked her to sit up, took bp again, it was 117/75, she felt better and wanted to go home. Her husband was with her, he drove her home.

Flank pain started spreading to my side and mid to lower back. Then it started in the left side. Then it went across my whole mid back and got extremely stiff. Part of my top lip is numb. Over 4 hours and I still can&#39;t breathe properly despite the use of my anti anxiety medicine hours ago. Neck pain. Legs walking in slow motion no matter how hard I tried to push them. Hyperventilating after coughing 2 or 3 separate times. Shooting pain in my back when I lay down. Can&#39;t catch my breath laying down.

                                                Around 10pm on the day i received the vaccine i began to experience a headache. I was unable to sleep due to the pain and around 2am it became severe to the point of being unbearable. Standing would relieve the pressure enough so i attempted to remain standing as tolerable. I also had severe lower back pain that made it difficult to walk. These symptoms remained until apx 3pm the day following the vaccine (4/8/21).

                                                After I got the vaccine my heart rate went over 100 and I had to lay down at the hospital to recover because I was so dizzy. On Saturday night and Sunday I felt some normal side effects like a severe headache, chills, nausea, and fatigue. Monday I felt better than normal and I thought I was in the all clear. Today (Tuesday) I woke up feeling like I had a stroke. I can still lift both arms and both sides of my face, but I can not think and feel like I am dying. I am scared to go to the hospital. I am unable to work. I feel incredibly emotional and unable to think. I feel so tired and the pain at the injection site is now even worse. I am getting chest pains, dizzy spells, really bad headache, and it feel like I am in a dream state unable to do things I normally can do. I am not okay and really regret getting the vaccine. I had no prior health concerns and probably would have survived covid, but it feels like I may never get my mental functioning back again.

I have never experienced a hormonal change the way I did when my period began. This would have been the first cycle after receiving the vaccine. The first day it started, (4/9/21), I felt like I was having a panic attack, anxiety attack or something similar. Now, I do not actually know what these attacks feel like, I am just stating that I assume this is what it feels like. I was not able to focus, felt like I was freaking out, almost as if I had taken some sort of pill that sped up my heart and made me jittery. I just wanted to report, incase others were experiencing the same issue. It lasted only the one day.

Fearing she was having an allergic reaction she came to the pharmacy counter to report this.  I grabbed an Epi-pen and took her blood pressure which was normal but her heart rate was 130 bpm, EMS was also called.  At this point the patient realized she was not having an allergic reaction but a panic attack.  EMS arrived, checked out the patient who&#39;s blood pressure had returned to normal at this point and told her when she was comfortable she was free to leave.  She stayed in the store for another hour before leaving.

                                                Kaleidoscope vision  twice, followed by 5-10 minutes of severe confusion and inability to remember words and son&#39;s date of birth.  The fogginess with feelings of a headache coming on for about an hour afterwards.  I was working out (as I do 3 times a week with weight training) when the kaleidoscope vision came on, but I didn&#39;t initially feel any other effects and since it went away within 5-10 minutes, I continued with my workout.  When I was driving home, it returned and the episode of confusion occurred as soon as I reached my home.  I went to the ER after looking up symptoms following the confusion and decided to get checked out since a mini-stroke seemed possible.  I have no history of migraines or other health conditions.  At the ER, they ran some bloodwork, but I have not received the results of those tests.  They also performed a CT scan and said that looked clear, but I have not seen any official results for that either.  I have also been advised by a physician that a CT scan won&#39;t show signs of a stroke and that I should have received an MRI.  I will be following up with a PCP to request an MRI and will provide those results when I have them.  I have had one other episode of the Kaleidoscope vision since the original event, and I was sitting down watching a movie at the time.  It went away within the same 5-10 minutes and I had what felt like a mild headache coming on, but no other symptoms.  And I have never had any migraines or regular headaches/vision events such as these before.

About 2 weeks exactly after the vaccine I got very very sick and went to the  in , ER - I didn&#39;t have a fever but everything hurt on my body and I was nauseous and Had blurred vision. My hearing was off - ringing in my ears.  I was pretty sick after that for about two weeks. I did a follow up with Dr. and he said it sounded typical this J &amp; J vaccine. He said there was nothing he could do. During those two weeks,  I kept taking lots of fluids and ibuprofen as needed. Headaches, body aches c hills, night sweats, blurred vision and I couldn&#39;t sleep - had insomnia. The night sweats were very weird - I never had that before and I could literally ring my clothes out they were so wet every night. I felt like I had a fever but I didn&#39;t the entire time. I felt like I was burning up but I had chills but there was no fever the whole time.   Lately now, I have been feeling a little bit sick for about a week. It&#39;s a little strange because I have a cough and phlegm and very congested in my head.

I had chills and my teeth were actually chattering at one point it was so bad. This gradually got worse as the evening went on. With it I also started feeling weak and fatigued. By 8pm I started to have a headache. Throughout the night symptoms worsened and I had a fever and more serious headache. My head was pounding so badly. I couldn&#39;t sleep at all. I also had a couple hot flashes to where I woke up sweating. Then I would feel frozen again. The nausea started during the night too. I thought I would throw up but didn&#39;t. At one point my heart was racing so fast I was a little concerned something bad would happen to me and contemplated going to the hospital. By morning I felt a little better, still nauseous and with a bad headache. My body was a little weak. These symptoms lasted all day Thursday. By that Friday morning I only had a little weakness and slight headache. By mid day Friday I was pretty much back to normal.

I continued running that temperature for a few hours and then  around 10am on 3-25-2021 I woke up and took my temperature and it dropped to 102.1. I fluctuated between 101.5 and 102.1 for rest of that day and by 3-26-2021 my temperature was back to normal. I had other common side effects with the fever but that was my only concern was the high fever.

                                                5 minutes post injection, pt became diaphoretic, pale, and c/o chest pressure.  She was placed on the floor with her legs elevated.  EMS was called, she was evaluated.  She was not transported and was released to go home after evaluation and complete resolution of her symptoms. I spoke with her today, she states she had a similar episode after her nasal piercing 2 years ago and she believes related to anxiety.  She states other than arm soreness and muscle aches today, no other symptoms persist.

I went to dr who advised I was having an allergic reaction and told me to take benedryl I had a 2in by 2inch hive under my skin at my time of visit which had gone down a little because of benedryl and it was extremely painful even 9 days out. I experienced extreme confusion and mental fog from Sunday all the way to Wednesday where I felt confused, and was having some rapid breathing.

My stomach hurt, I was nauseated. I went through hot &amp; cold sweats &amp; chills. I got really light headed &amp; disoriented. I began to get a fever.  I felt far from flu symptoms. My heart was racing. I had to get into my shower repeatedly &amp; just lay. I cried. I dont recommend this to anyone! It has been 2 days &amp; i am still experiencing symptoms. I read the fact sheet for the Janssen shot. I am going to get a check up by a doctor. I feel like I am having an allergic reaction. I never felt so much pain in my life; my side effects are far from the flu symptoms.

It was very scary. Day 4 I am more myself currently, but unsure of how things will go from here.

                                                I had period like cramping, sever muscle cramps everywhere I ever had an injury in my life hurt. It get like the day after a car accident. Starting at 8 hrs after the vaccine was administered. When I breastfeed my baby for 36 hours after it felt like razor blades when the milk passed through my nipples and I had clogged ducts. Normally it is not painful and I don?t experience clogs. I got temporary relief soaking in Epsom salts in a hot bath. Even in the hot bath my nipples wouldn?t flatten or go smooth. I?ve never experienced a totally body reaction like this. It really get like every pain receptor that ever had activated reactivated. After 6 hours it subsided and I felt fatigued. During this time my temp was 102.5 I had a fever for 8 hrs. The second day at hour 28 the muscle aches returned but not as bad. While I don?t have a temperature I still feel warm and flushed and had trouble sleeping the second night my back is still sore.

                                                April 7th about 6:30pm: I became very confused, having trouble remembering where I was or answering simple questions.  Around that same time my vision became blurry, and my face in and around my mouth became numb, I began to slur as a result.  The numbness and slurring increased over the next hour or so.  After that hour or so, I realized I was exhausted and my head hurt so I went to sleep. I also had a strange emotional response to all of this, I behaved giddily and as though it were funny.  April 8th about 8am: I woke up and the confusion, blurry vision, numbness, and slurring were gone.  I had a mild headache, brain fog, and was still more tired than usual.  Later that evening the headache developed in to something more like a migraine, intense pain focused behind my right eye and blurred vision.  At this time I again decided to go to sleep.  It would have been about 8pm.  April 9th about 8am: I woke up still feeling a moderate headache focused on the right side, still tired, and brain fog.  The symptoms weakened throughout the day and by the evening I was feeling mostly normal again.   I have felt healthy and normal since.

                                                I have many allergies and adverse events from prior vaccines, so I took a Benadryl before the injection. I was very pleased nothing detrimental happened at the time. My head and neck were a little itchy but went away, some dizzyness but went away, all after about an hour. The arm didn&#39;t blow up like usual.  That night, I started to experience the usual vaccine side effects i.e. headache, feverish, sweating, joint aches. All this I expected starting around 8:45 -9pm.   At about 10 - 10:30 pm, I began to have abdomen pain/pelvic pain... I started feeling like I was getting period cramps and lower intestinal discomfort. I just had my period though, so it didn&#39;t make sense (about 7 -10 days ago). I am also on the pill so I know for a fact I just had it and started a new pack. I was very confused and thought it was odd...can&#39;t be, maybe it would go away.   I woke up about 3am with intense uterus/period cramps which kept me up, in and out of sleep. About 5am I felt like I had my period (fluid down there), went to the bathroom and indeed, I was bleeding... a lot. The cramps continued, the bleeding continued and now 6 days later it is finally going away. I never get head aches and my head has continued to hurt on and off also.

                                                * Arm was very sore for about the first 10 minutes.  Moving it reduced it pretty quickly and was no worse than a minor ache for most of the next day or so. * Had a mild headache before the shot (believe due to not having had caffeine that day yet) * At about 6 pm on 4/10, lost appetite due to mild nausea (just enough to not want to eat but not enough to vomit) * At about this time I noticed I also started to feel a little winded, akin to walking just briskly enough that you have to breath harder than if you&#39;re just sitting / resting.  It did not get any worse than this however, so I opted to keep a close eye and see if it eased (which it would by end of Sunday, 4/11) * At about 8:30 pm on 4/10, noticed I felt warm, had a fever between 100.4 to 100.8 * Also around 8:30 pm I noticed that pain I normally feel from my herniated discs and pinched nerves (L4/L5 L5/S1) just ACHED and was more painful than normal. * Started feeling tired (I&#39;m usually up until around 1-2 am, and I was ready to go to bed by 9pm on 4/10)  Also felt a little forgetful / hard to concentrate on anything * When I went to bed, I noticed that my eyes were very sensitive to the white light from my monitor.  This is usually a sign of a painless migraine with auras that essentially blind me for about a half hour.  I did not have auras, though my headache was steadily getting worse to the point I suspect it might have actually been a migraine) * At about 12:30 am on 4/11, the headache got to the point where I could no longer ignore it (best I can describe is it felt like someone was trying to peel my skull of like you would an orange) so I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen.  I also by this point had a fever of 102, though it would drop to 100.5 or so within a few minutes of taking the Ibuprofen. * At about this point the arm starting aching a lot more, I assume because I wasn&#39;t using it while sleeping.  It felt like someone had punched me multiple times hard in the same spot. * I felt much better on the morning of 4/11.  However as the day continued I felt more and more tired.  My temperature was higher than normal but very mild; it stayed around 99.8 for most of the day that I took it.  By Monday, 4/12 I felt mostly fine aside from my arm aching worse than it did when I first got the shot.  Now on 4/14 its pretty much no longer achy.

                                                Around 6 pm on the ninth, I started to feel lethargic; really lethargic. 8:30 pm - 100.5 fever. 09:00 pm I had chills that shook my body. Very intense. Extreme body aches and especially legs which prompted me to use a weighted blanket. That was all overnight and excessive sweating overnight. That may have been from the fever. I had nausea that started around midnight. That was mild. I did notice a little bit of a headache at that time as well which was mild. Saturday, fever all day, fatigue. Overnight that night - a little achy; but the chills had gone away. Tuesday night the body aches had gone away - they had diminished Saturday- Monday. I had body aches until about 6 or 7 pm on Monday. The fatigue -all this week I&#39;ve still been dragging - I&#39;m still tired. The fever would go up and down with Tylenol but I needed it until Sunday night. Headache - the first one was gone Saturday morning. I had a headache  Sunday evening and Monday morning. It was gone about lunch time.  The injection site was tender with the delivery of the shot until Sunday when I went to bed. It was not pain but just tender to the touch. Usually that happens with any shot for me but usually it doesn&#39;t stay tender for that long. April 13th - Televisit with a Physician&#39;s Asst in my doctor&#39;s office.

                                                Monday one week after vaccine was administered, red dots all over my legs appeared when I woke up. Did not itch which I found strange bc they looked like flea bites. But I went to the ER and said they were purpura.   Also as of Tuesday  April 13th, I have had throbbing headaches daily lasting on and off all day.   Finally today and last night (April 19 and 20th) I have been dizzy.   I am feeling weird.  I regret taking this vaccine.  If there was a way to undo this I would.

                                                1. Received J&amp;J shot in Left Deltoid- told ahead of time &#34;People say it burns&#34;. It did burn incredibly bad--unlike any shot I have ever had-it burned like the time I had knee injection. I assumed this was &#34;normal&#34; for COVID.  My arm ached/hurt to move shoulder -could tell it was painful/stiff driving back again, I knew many were having &#34;reactions&#34; so I presumed this normal--thinking ROM issue/pain was &#34;normal&#39; despite my whole arm feeling such.  By 1800 that evening, my entire arm was throbbing, and starting swelling-although right handed--could see entire arm bigger than other. I wasn&#39;t able to sleep/get arm in comfortable position.  I thought this was a normal reaction-had patients to see-but touching/moving my arm hurt as bad as time I torn my meniscus.  Over next several days, swelling went down--I could painfully move my arm, but it was weak-unable to function as usual. I still thought this was normal and struggled through week as April 4-9 was Spring break.  I had trouble even leaning forward on bike because should STILL hurt--and it tapped on shoulder it would hurt incredible bad/couldn&#39;t carry daughter. Since I have higher pain tolerance- I was able to push through-however, by following week, this was no longer working--arm started swelling again.  I felt the injection was high and was talking with my mom whom  in primary care NP, and she mentioned shoulder injuries could happen if injection given too high--which is when I realized that my shoulder pain was not &#34;all in my head&#34;.  S/p vaccination day 19 forward, it has seemed to flare as bad as initial day one and not gone back.   This is when I looked up and discovered there was also a condition called &#34;SHOULDER INJURY RELATED TO VACCINATION&#34; that described exact symptoms I had.     It also mentioned that damage isn&#39;t necessary should from needle--- although it was a year ago-- I had probable COVID April 2020---which could have made my immune system hyper-reactive.      I have had to call out sick April 16th because shoulder was causing pain, flushing and warm feeling.   April 19th I saw Dr-- he drew blood (I don&#39;t know what)-- didn&#39;t do full shoulder exam and referred to orthpedicc.  APril 30th I ended up calling out again as when arm would swell it made focusing at work very difficult. I saw my PCP via telehealth and she prescribed Prednisdone dose pack.   May 2nd, I  started treatment with cryotherapy machine and this was only thing that relieved pain and swelling enough to help relieve pressure.      May 7th---I saw Dr.-unfortunately, he didn&#39;t do anything because he stated a vaccine couldn&#39;t cause such type of damage to rotator cuff, didn&#39;t believe there was a condition called SIRVA and declined to treat with cortisone shot &#34;This whole thing started with a shot-that would be inappropriate&#34; .  He was willing to refer me to Physical therapy whom HAS heard of condition and knows how to rehab

Also mid-April, on April 17, I had a sudden subjunctive hemorrhage happen in my right eye for no apparent reason.  There was no injury to my eye and my ophthalmologist told me it would heal in a few weeks.  Two weeks ago (beginning of May) a terrible, nearly unbearable headache began.  A few days later, I continued to feel strange and began to get more frequently short of breath and my cough worsened.  On 5/5/2021 I went to my doctor , Family Medicine, and was then sent to the local hospital, and had a cat scan done of my lungs, around 9 AM.  I was  I was diagnosed with a Pulmonary Embolism in my right lung, that is so large that it is taking up 2/3 of the lung and its pushing on my heart.  I am currently taking Eliquis and waiting to be seen by a specialist.  I still have shortness of breath, headaches, and chest pain as a result of my PE.

As the days passed I started getting worst and worst I was loosing mobility in my body my husband had to take me to the restroom. On 04/06/2021 is when I went to the Emergency Room. When I got to the hospital I could not breath my ribs hurt a lot &amp; I had horrible back pain. They put me oxygen and gave me fluids but they said I had to get transfer to another hospital and they transferred me on an ambulance. In the other hospital us where they transferred me they kept poking my stomach when I asked them why they kept poking it they told me that it was to stop the blood cloths. I was hospitalized for 5 days. When I was sent home I was still not feeling good I was feeling sick still I&#39;ve been trying to recover slowly but I am not the same. I&#39;m still in a lot of pain I can&#39;t move my arms because of how much it hurts my back keeps hurting a lot as well. I want to go back to normal to how I was I can&#39;t do anything I can&#39;t even cook for my kids. I now have depression.

                                                Shortly after the vaccine on the drive home the injection site got super hot, the arm began to swell and turn red.  I developed a fever and my sinuses got really stuffy.  I began to throw up profusely which made all symptoms from other issues occur causing me to swell all over and because I couldnt take any meds or keep anything down I went to the ER.   While there I began wheezing and experiencing SOB which still is an issue today.  I have foggy moments where my brain seems so foggy that I am having issues with my short term memory.  I was administered IV fluids, IV morphine and IV ibuphropen to help with the symptoms and was hospitalized for less than a day further evaluation

                                                I started experiencing flu-like symptoms at around 5 PM on 3/14/21.  I was feverish and had chills, muscle aches, and a headache.  I had very strong chills for a few hours and then I noticed that my resting heart rate was around 128 bpm at around 1:30 AM on 3/15/21.  I was running a 100.6 fever at that time.  My fever subsided in the morning and the headache persisted throughout the day, and I was very tired as I did not get much sleep the night before.  I did not work that day (Monday, 3/15).  At the time I was about 7 weeks pregnant.  I noticed some very light spotting later in the day on 3/15, and then I continued spotting on 3/16.  I consulted a midwife at the  facility at 4 PM on 3/16/21 and took a blood test to measure my hCG hormone levels.  The following day, 3/17, I received the results that I had a normal level of hCG hormone and normal hemoglobin levels.  As the day continued, the spotting turned into bleeding, and eventually the bleeding became heavy starting around 4 PM.  I received an ultrasound on 3/18/21 at 8 AM and later spoke with a midwife from facility at 11 AM that day, confirming that there was no viable pregnancy detected via ultrasound.  I had lost quite a bit of blood at that point.  I am, as of 8:35 PM on Friday,  March 19th, still bleeding and experiencing the impact of miscarriage.

                                                Approx 12 after shot I woke up feeling very ill and nauseous. As I walked to the restroom to vomit I lost 100% of my vision, I became very disoriented and had the loudest screeching in both ears. I screamed for my husband and I caught me as I was taken to the floor with no mobility. The episode last several minutes before he was able to move me back to bed. I had severe sweating and ear ringing. As I report this I still have a lingering brain fog and ear ringing.  I reported it to my physician and told to go to the ER if any reoccurrence of reaction.

I reported on the v-safe&#39;s daily check-in that one day I was totally exhausted and had to take a nap. I slept for about 2 hours. The exhaustion was akin to the first semester of pregnancy exhaustion when you can barely stay awake. I was fine after. The exhaustion was significant enough that I could not focus on work, so I decided to nap. On the v-safe reporting, I indicated that this &#34;interferred with my daily work&#34; or whatever that category of assessing the impact is. The agency staff who reached out to me after for details asked that I fill out this form and submit it. I do not remember the exact date of the exhaustion but, if possible to match my v-safe checklist with this report, it is available there. I believe it was 3/16.

                                                I have a history of anaphylaxis, and disclosed that to the medics so they watched me more carefully, which was good, as while I did not experience anything that severe, I did immediately get itchy, turn red and feel quite nauseated. However,  after they monitored me awhile, I told them I felt okay to go home. The next day I had the expected mild flu-like symptoms, which I anticipated. However, what?s been atypical is they returned tenfold three days later. This time with a much higher fever (103), severe chills, fatigue, a seemingly never-ending headache,  muscle spasms,  chest palpitations and suddenly I am experiencing asthma (which is typically seasonal) and am coughing, too.  I?m now a week past when I was vaccinated and each day was feel worse, not better. I have had to cancel my clients and hire a sitter to care for my kids as I am too weak and ill to do it.  I looked up common reactions and nothing states chest pain and/or asthma, nor that it should last this long. That said, as I am high-risk, I work from home and homeschool both of my young kids. Thus, I have been nowhere aside from the vaccine site. Moreover, my partner, our kids and sitter get routinely tested for me,  and everyone is negative. Thus, it appears I am having prolonged, heightened side-effects much more intense than the ?mild? flu-like symptoms otherwise reported, which is concerning. I took no medication prior to receiving the vaccine, either.

Burning feeling at injection site continued for several hours.  Brain fog and chills set in within 2 hours post injection.  Fatigue, headache, and joint stiffness and pain started about 4 hours post injection.  Injection was given on left arm; left hand became painful about 4 hours post injection, as though someone had put it in a vice.  Joint pain worsened.  Upon laying down to sleep, I became so cold I could not get warm even with an electric blanket on high.  Started to feel stabbing pains in my jaw, back of my neck and down behind my shoulder blade on my left side.  Headache worsened and started to feel pressure in my ears.  Joints, my knees in particular, felt like they were made of gravel and someone was stabbing them with a hot poker.  Did not sleep due to pain.  Has been 20 hours post vaccine, injection site is still very painful and swollen.  Joint pain, headache, fatigue and chills continue.  Was unable to go to work today.

I shivered and sweated for 12 hours overnight with a severe headache. I tossed most of the night and had to get up to pee 3 times throughout the night - which is extremely uncommon. By 24 hours after the injection, I still had a strong headache and was mostly able to regulate my body temp. By 36 hours after, I felt tired but no longer had a headache or chills. My injection site is red, raised and very tender.

Arm is still sensitive 5 days later but tolerable.  *Seems that if a person with a headache disorder gets the shot, this may be the biggest challenge to combat, in my opinion, and that should be made more aware to public.

It was reported that the patient left the pharmacy about 45 minutes after receiving the vaccination and the patient stated she was feeling better. The patient the reported to the pharmacy that the morning of April 7, 2021 that her symptoms of shortness of breath and wheezing returned and she went to an emergency room for treatment. The patient stated that after admission into the ER, the medical staff performed two EKGs and one chest X-ray, which were unremarkable. The patient stated she received treatment with Duoneb because she was wheezing and and treatment with IV methylprednisolone because her throat and tongue appeared swollen.

                                                I was fine until about 5 hours later and then oh my was that rough. It started with severe back pain first that came on very sudden. Then I noticed I was sweating real bad and I was so weak it took all my energy to just lift my head off my pillow. Small burst of energy like sitting up became  quite a challenge. All I have done is sleep none stop and when i wake ive noticed a bit of confusion. For example I thought i woke up at 7am tomorrow and then kept falling back asleep on and off till about 8:30 when i realized it&#39;s still today. The body aches and pains were very rough too. My husband went at the same time for the same shot and what Im experiencing vs him is not comparable! He has mild discomfort mine is extreme. Also Ive had a headache a pretty bad one  since about 10pm yesterday as well. Ive been unable to even think about food Im too tired to care even. I have not ate since I was vaccinated yesterday. Ive never reacted to any vaccine or shot of any kind till now.

About 30 mins to an hour later I notice that every move I make, the joints I&#39;m moving hurt. Like EVERY joint is now sore when I move. (With the exception of fingers/toes) I tossed and turned all night and got a headache. The queasiness was very mild, but happened any time I moved.  This morning now my joints no longer hurt, but I still have the headache.

I also felt like my heart was racing and I was going to pass out. I remained at the pharmacy for approx another hour, still not feeling well. EMS was called, checked my BP and heart rate, which was a little elevated. SBP 137, HR 90-low 100&#39;s. I did take some liquid benadryl while still at the pharmacy. After about an hour and a half to 2 hours, the feeling completely subsided. The symptoms began again today 4/9/21 at approx 1015am. I have taken another benadryl capsule.

                                                After the immunization was administered to the patient, she was asked to have a seat in the waiting area for observation.  A few minutes after she sat, she told her husband who was seated with her she didn&#39;t feel well (he did not inform us).  The technician observing her noticed she passed out and reported to the pharmacist (myself).  I designated a team member to call 911 and ran out to the patient.  She was extremely pale and her lips were blue.  With the assistance of her husband I laid her on the floor, had him elevate her feet and checked for pulse and breathing.  I couldn&#39;t immediately find her pulse but within 30 seconds she began to come to.  She appeared to tremor a few times as she came to and her color began to return.  She was extremely confused and did not know where she was upon awakening.  EMS arrived on the scene approximately 10-15 minutes after the event.  They did standard patient evaluation which was unremarkable and proceeded to bring her to the local ED,  According to the patient, the ED visit yielded nothing and they said &#34;she couldn&#39;t be more healthy&#34;.  One note, that was revealed in conversation with the patient while waiting for EMS to arrive is that the patient had very little to eat or drink prior to being administered the vaccine.

                                                On March 10 (the day after my vaccine) I felt the normal body aches and had a pretty bad headache. That all went away in the evening on March 10. Since that day I have had off and on dizziness/lightheadedness. On March 19 I fainted in my kitchen. I hit my kitchen table and had a huge knot on my head and bruises all down my left side of my body. My left shoulder still hurts from the fall and I still have a small knot on my head (left side just above my left eye on my forehead). I went to my primary care doctor on  March 24 and reported the event. I asked if it could be related to the COVID vaccine and she said she wasn&#39;t sure since the Jansen one was so new, but that she had seen these effects from the other two vaccines.  At the doctor&#39;s office my blood pressure was on the lower end (110/60). My normal blood pressure runs about 118/70. They ran some blood work and that all came back normal. They did an EKG in the office, but my blood pressure stayed pretty close to the same as it was the first reading. They then sent me to get a CT scan on my head, which also came back normal. She did diagnose me with a concussion. I was out of work the entire week (March 22-March 26) due to this. She also ordered me to have an echo done. While at the office for the echo, my blood pressure ran 99/46 (this was on March 31). The results of the echo came back normal.  I also got a monitor to wear for 72 hours on March 31. I took that to the doctor on April 5 and I am still waiting on results from that.  Since the event on March 19, I have had headaches and body aches. I have also had slight lightheadedness off and on.

The cotton mouth, fatigue, headache and fever of 99.9 to 101 lasted until about 8:00am on 4/8/2021., where I had a second set of chills and the fever broke.  On 4/9/2021 I still had fatigue and had to leave work early as I couldn&#39;t multi-task and had a hard time staying focused.  The inability to focus and fatigue lasted 4/10/201 and 4/11/2021, just walking up and down my stairs at home exhausted me.  On 4/12/2021 I went back to work, my focus is better but still not back to where it should be, I still get exhausted easily and everything is a bit too bright.  On 4/12/2021 about 7:30am, I had a bloody nose that took a while to stop (about 30 minutes), that is not normal as I rarely have a bloody nose; I was late to work due to it and had another one while at work around 11:40am; it was not as bad as the first and stopped after approximately 10 minutes.  Today is 4/13/2021- Things are still a little too bright and my energy level is not quite back to normal, I also have a slight headache.

                                                Developed a headache in the afternoon following my vaccination that continued through the night. It was the worst in the middle of the night and early morning hours - similar to a migraine - and nothing seemed to help. I took multiple doses of Tylenol to try to take the edge off, but it just got progressively worse and interfered with my sleep until around 3 a.m. when I was finally able to fall asleep. By the time I woke up around 7 a.m., the pain was less intense.

I then started shaking uncontrollably and my heart rate increased to the 100s. The shaking and rapid heart rate lasted for 30 minutes. Woke up again multiple times with body sweats.  In the morning still lethargic but all symptoms resolved by noon.

                                                Immediately at 15 minutes: blurry vision; felt off and felt loopy (out of it);  I was dropping food on myself as I was eating. My pupils were really small. I felt out of it. Finally I got home (son drove me). I had mild chest pains and heart racing (had this initially, too). And the chest pains and heart racing kept happening off and on through the night. I had headaches that night and I felt nauseated. Next day, I had to wear sunglasses inside my  house as I was light sensitive and my pupils remained small. I still felt body aches and nausea but the eyes were the biggest concern...shining light by my eyes didn&#39;t make my pupils bigger. The light that came off my phone aggravated my eyes and my head. Thursday, I still had nausea but headache wasn&#39;t bad with Tylenol. Those full two days all I did was sleep. Friday, I felt like things were mild and Tylenol was helping. I called heathline for my eyes. As those still weren&#39;t improving. I got into my eye doctor for an exam (4/9). There was no inflammation and he decided to dilate my eyes. Of course, my eyes were blurry and my eyes responded to that dilation. I napped after returning home. My pupils after the nap were finally responding. I still had a little light sensitivity in my eyes but not as much as I had had and pupils were doing what they should with light. So this was 3 1/2 days later. I still do get mild headache and mild chest pain - it comes and it goes. I have a doctor appt - general check up  - that was already scheduled for tomorrow and he will examine for chest pain.

                                                On the day after vaccination I had extreme dizziness and faintheadedness, and heavy brain fog. I could not drive or stand up for long periods of time. I was having issues expressing thoughts and having my normal conversations. This was accompanied by strong headache on right side of my head and slightly stuffed sinuses. The day afterwards all symptoms disappeared. However, they reappeared at milder levels intermittently through the next several days. I am now at day 14 with the dizziness and brain fog still occurring intermittently and last night had short episode of abdominal pain. I decided to call the doctor&#39;s office this morning when the dizziness started again, for advice and to schedule a brief exam. They told me to go straight to the ER instead, so I went and had blood drawn. Blood came back normal and likelihood of clot very low, so was released but referred to my primary doctor and a neurologist for follow up over the next week. The intermittent dizziness and brain fog persist ever since my shot 2 weeks ago. Additional symptoms that I believe to be normal are dull leg pain behind the knees, slight tightness in chest sometimes, and recurring mild headache.

I was putting cold water bottles on my neck to feel better. Heartrate went from 130 to 100 at 45 minutes out. It stayed in the hundreds for a couple of hours. About three hours after shot - I developed itching and hives all over - chest, arms, and tops of thighs. I took Benadryl. The injection site on arm stayed incredibly painful - I couldn&#39;t even move my arm. 4/12/2021 - I got in contact with someone from Clinic. They felt like there had been a reaction to vaccine - advised to continue Benadryl. A localized reaction to injection site. First 48 hours  bone, muscle, joint pain was extreme - it hurt to be alive. It took a week for that to fade so I could function again. Got in contact with Dr. again 19th. Swollen oval under my skin about 2 -3 inches long at injection site; fatigue and nausea is still there. Ran some bloodwork. Advised to take Benadryl when itching came back. This morning, I called the doctor today 20th - an allergist was pulled in for this conversation as well - I was prescribed to take Zyrtec; Claritin and a prednisone (to prevent reaction from continuing) and also Zofran for the long term reaction to the vaccine. Watch the injection site for any redness and heat (there&#39;s none right now). Three days after vaccine, I did get a blistery rash across my neck at my collarbone area, down my chest and under my breast and across my rib cage on front and a little on my back on the back of my shoulders and down along the spine. Additionally there was a flat orangish rash that developed - on my face and nose. And then my skin started peeling off there and it (that flat orangish rash) showed up  also on the middle of my chest too right in the middle of the other rash on my chest. That is improving with the medications I&#39;m taking.

I still had  a slight headache. The abdominal pain comes and goes - I still get it to this day. I called my Dr and he referred me to go to ER on Tuesday, 13th. No treatment, they told me to follow up with dr if I had pain continue.  I just went today to a follow up with my doctor. She increased my medication for pain so I can get to work as I&#39;ve been out for the last 5 days since I have not been able to. She told me to do the Naproxen twice  a day now and also gave me Gabapentin and Tramadol.

The main thing is that I slept a lot and was unable to work which lasted 9 days. The thing that I went to urgent care for pelvic pain, body aches and pain, developed an UTI and my symptoms cleared at home with medications.  At the urgent care lab work and urine culture was performed. When I went to the urgent care they said I also had tachycardia.  My symptoms have resolved.

                                                First I had a funny taste in my mouth - 2-4 hours after vaccine. 8-9 hours after the injection - I woke up with the first of what would become extremely severe body aches. I took some Aleve - that helped some with the symptoms - but not efficacious. It turned into bone deep pain that made me cry. I would say 7 on the pain scale. That lasted two days. It started slow and then it got big. It was very bad for 12-16 hours. I didn&#39;t leave bed and I cried a lot. Worse than childbirth. I was left with another two days after that with some severe fatigue and then I started recovering. About 10 days after vaccine,  on the morning of the 17th, I thought I had a spider bite but it was the beginning of a rather severe shingles outbreak which I haven&#39;t had before.  I had a telehealth appt with employee health -  I was treated  with anti-viral - Valtrex generic on the 19th. The rash was mostly gone with the  medicine - everything is scabbed over but the nerve pain is still here to this day. I still missed work this week.

My fever broke the morning of 5/14.  My arm has a hard knot where I received the shot that is very painful.  This was reaction was within a few hours of receiving the vaccine. I still can&#39;t sleep on my left side as of 5/18, but the knot is getting smaller.  My lymph nodes under my left arm where I received the shot are noticeably swollen.  This happened most noticeably on 5/14 and remains swollen.
