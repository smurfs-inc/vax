I also was experiencing a heavy chest and shortness of breath. All but one of the adverse events went away after 24-36 hours - the shortness of breath and shallow breathing have persisted up through today. I am very aware of my breathing and how my chest feels tight, like I&#39;m not getting enough air.

                                                Hi, I received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine one week ago, Thurs March 11. On friday, I experienced the typical flu like symptoms - chills aches pains and fever. These have slowly gone away, but a week later I still have chills and constantly shake, and diarrhea. The most significant side effect I want to report is extreme vertigo and dizziness and headaches. These have been present for a week now and have prevented me from working and doing daily activities. I constantly feel like Im going to fall over and cannot see clearly. I previously had vestibular migraines, but these have been mostly gone due to going to the chiropractor and taking my supplements. The vaccine brought them back now in full force. I read that this is becoming a commonality among other people and need answers on this. I want to make sure its not permanent or that I will have this as a serious side effect.

                                                I started to feel tired once I got the shot, I got the shot at around 1:15 pm. About 5 pm, I started to feel really cold and my whole body was shivering and vibrating. My whole body also started to ache and my bones felt heavy. At about 10 pm I started to get really high fever and felt so cold. I could not sleep even with a winter jacket on, I had a really bad headache in the center of my forehead, lower back pain and felt extremely sore and weak. I found it difficult to stand or walk. I woke up at 2:30 am from bed, to get a snack and took 2 ibuprofen to ease the symptoms. Woke up at about 10 am next day, felt slightly better. Fever has gone down slightly but not completely. Still feeling really cold and shivering.

                                                I started to lose mobility in my left arm the evening of my vaccine appointment. The following morning, I could not raise my arm at all. The pain in my upper left arm (where the vaccine was administered) has been severe for more than 48 hours. It is extremely painful to the touch. I can use my left hand, but cannot function/cannot perform necessary daily work and school tasks due to the loss of mobility. I have been in extreme pain and fear my shoulder has been injured.

                                                Patient was administered vaccine and told to wait the 15 minute monitoring period. After about 4 minutes, I heard her say &#34;I&#39;m not feeling right.&#34; I went to where she was sitting and asked &#34;are you ok?&#34; and had her take some slow, deep breaths. I then saw her eyes roll back and she lost consciousness. Thankfully, I was there and grabbed her as she toppled from the chair. I told the staff to call 911 and supported her neck and body in the chair. I could tell she was breathing and she was sweating profusely. I held her and spoke to her, and after about 15 seconds, she began to come out of it. After about a minute she was alert and orientated again.  I had her slowly sip a little water. The EMTs arrived in about 5 minutes and the assessed her vitals. She indicated that this was the first time anything like this had happened to her. They advised that since she had fainted, she should go to the hospital for observation, but she declined, stated that she felt fine at that point. Since she was driving, I insisted that she remain another one-half hour before leaving. During that time she drank more water and alternately sat and walked around the pharmacy. She did indicate that she had drank a protein shake that morning, but not eaten. I advised her to in the future, tell her doctor and/or any immunizer about the event. She left, stating that she was feeling fine, and I called her several hours later to make sure that she had indeed gotten home ok. She again said that she felt fine.

I woke up at 11:55p (8 hours post vaccine, two hours after falling asleep) due to full body chills and shaking. I took two Tylenol. This lasted about 45 minutes. I felt cold but didn?t have a fever.  I kept waking up throughout the night clammy.  I woke up at 5:30a (30 mins earlier than normal) because I couldn?t sleep and had a headache.  I felt sore and achy and very fatigued all day. I took the afternoon off work and came home and slept 3 hours. Still felt groggy and sore after. Felt more normal the next morning. My left arm is still sore two days post vaccination.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, I slept okay, the next morning about an hour after I woke up I had severe chills, body aches, and nausea. I had to go home from work due to these feelings. Eventually, developed into a fever. I went home and the chills and aches worsened. I could not get warm not matter how many layers or blankets I had. I took tylenol and fell asleep after several hours. When I woke up, I was profusely sweaty, my fever  broke. I was able to eat a small lunch and continued to lie down the whole day. My symptoms lessened and were more minimal 24 hours after. After going to sleep the second night, I felt back to normal upon wake up.

                                                Fever started at around 4:30 am the morning after receiving the vaccine. The chills woke me up, so I took Tylenol 1000 mg and my fever broke about an hour later. I had to keep taking Tylenol 1000 mg at 10:30 am and 4:30 pm to control my fever. Each dose worked well for the first 3 hours or so on the fever, but then it would come back. I also had muscle and headaches and fatigue, which made it very difficult to move around. The Tylenol also helped with that somewhat, but I spent most of the day in bed and on the couch (and I am normally very active). By around 5:30-6pm, the symptoms were fading slowly. I felt a lot less achy and my body temperature felt closer to regular by the time I went to bed at 9pm.

It felt like I could not get warm no matter how many extra blankets I added. This soon led to a fever. I was in an out of sleep for the next few hours and woke up around 2:30 AM. At that point the fever had broken and I was sweating. I still had body aches, which I think was due to my body being tensed up for some many hours, and I had a splitting headache, as well. At around 4:30 AM, I woke up again, with a very sore arm a terrible headache still. I got up and took 400 mg of Ibuprofen and went back to sleep. At 7 AM my alarm went off and all adverse effects seemed to be gone other than a sore arm. The sore arm last for about 6 days.

Soreness lingered but the sharper pain went away shortly after. About 8-10 hours later I began feeling nauseous and lightheaded. 12 hours after vaccine I had trouble falling asleep, overcome with nausea and chills.  This turns into sweating and insomnia the rest of the night. The following day I felt better, but the next night (and following one) I continued feeling a bit sick. Currently (3 days later) my upper arm is still very sore and I have lots of muscle/joint aches throughout my whole body.

                                                Vaccination appointment was at 1:30 pm on Monday, April 5. I received the shot at around 2:00pm in my left arm. It hurt going in, but quickly dissipated as I moved my arm. I felt fine for the rest of the day. I felt normal the following morning (April 6), but started to feel tired in the early afternoon. I took a nap around 3:00-4:30pm, and woke up feeling slightly hungry. I went to bed around 11:00pm. I woke up the next day (April 7) with a headache. I called in sick to work and stayed in bed as my headache grew worse and nausea began to appear. I threw up for the first time at 11:00am, then again around 11:30am. I emptied my bowels in between these bouts of vomiting, and my stomach was very obviously empty after the second bout. I took a nap from 12:00-2:00pm, after which I threw up at 2:30pm and then again at 3:00pm and again at 3:30pm. I took another nap from 4:00-5:00pm, then threw up again around 5:30pm. I threw up a seventh time around 6:00pm and saw  a couple flecks of blood in my vomit. Each bout was sudden in onset and violent but quick. I think I burst some of the blood vessels in my throat, because it was sore. I called a friend to take me to the ER, and threw up once or twice more while waiting. On the way to the ER, I threw up for the last time. The ER gave me Toradol, Zofran, and two bags of IV fluids. This improved all my symptoms. The next morning, April 8, I felt much better until 12:00pm, when I laid down for a nap and couldn&#39;t get out of bed until 4:30. My headache had returned so I took Advil, then ate some rice. I felt better from 6:00pm onwards.

                                                I received the vaccine at around 5:23pm, and then about 11pm the same night I was awoken from sleep by terrible body shivers. I managed to doze off for about an hour before I was woken up again by a migraine at midnight; dozed off again, and woke up at around 2 am with a mild fever (around 99.3 degrees). Sometime between the migraine and fever I began to develop terrible body aches as well. The first 24 hours were the worst as I was completely bedridden. The next day, 4/8/21, was better, but the body aches and migraine persisted all day while the fever broke late morning. The third day (today, 4/9/21) everything is feeling better but the migraine is still a persistent issue.

Approx 7 hours after receiving vaccine I experienced a sudden onset of overall body aches and joint pain specifically in my knees. It was kind of severe- even my skin was hurting when I got goosebumps. A fever came on after that and I was shivering, cold, sweaty. Approx 11 hours after injection I began to experience a severe headache and sleepiness. Symptoms continued overnight and disturbed my sleep, but were relieved somewhat by taking ibuprofen. By the next morning (after sleeping 14 hours) I was only feeling tired, arm soreness, and headache (no more fever, chills, body aches). All symptoms except arm soreness cleared up rather suddenly, approx 24 hours after they came on (which was approx 31 hours after injection).

My heart rate seems a little elevated and I am experiencing sensitivity and body aches. I have taken naproxen and acetaminophen. It is now 4 hours since symptom onset and I have not gotten much relief, if any. I would describe my symptoms as moderate.

I did notice my Raynaud?s symptoms became way worse.  At about 5:30pm I started to feel extremely cold. By 6pm I was having horrible pains and spasms in my lower back and hips. My muscles and joints became very stiff. This moved to my neck/shoulders, and down my thighs. I lost feeling in my feet and started struggling to be able to take in a full breath. I felt like my whole body was locked up. I started feeling nauseous, but part of that may have been from the nerves. The next morning I felt a bit more mobile but still nauseous and stiff. I have slowly gotten better throughout the day, but am still stiff and exhausted

                                                About 7-8 minutes later I started feeling pressure in the  right side of my head. It went away a bit. I was walking after the 15 minutes and started feeling weird in my face, I just sat in my car and waited because I had to drive.  I started feeling numbness under my eye and down the rest of my face. The thing that worried me the most I had so much pressure under my eye like it was inside my brain.  The numbness and pain caused me to freak out.  I went to back to the convention center to let them know, they brought the Paramedic to me they started checking me and doing a work up. They told me I wasn&#39;t a life threatening emergency and my vitals were ok. They offered to take me to the ER and I declined and I decided to leave because I have been there for 1hr 45mins. I felt like my symptoms were at 70%. When I got home I freaked out again because the numbness didn&#39;t go away and my face looked like it was a little lower and had a panic attack and went to the ER. They checked on me and told me I didn&#39;t have a stroke. They told me It was a side effect to the vaccine. They told me to follow up with the Neurologist if I have any more symptoms, I have an appointment with them in a couple weeks. I&#39;m a little concerned because there is a minor pain that I didn&#39;t have before on my right side and it worries me.

Around 7am I woke up still with the same symptoms so I took another 2 tylenols.  I remained up but started feeling bad so I laid down and took a nap.  Around 4pm I took 2 more tylenols because I just didnt feel well.  I didnt feel well the remaineder of the day and laid down for bed around 7pm and woke up the next morning and all symptoms had subsided.  I was 16 weeks gestation at the time of the vaccine.

I slept from 3:45 to 4:30 pm but was still tired and felt weak. I did feel hungry and made dinner over 30 minutes. However, this wore me out. I was even more tired and started getting dizzy. I almost fainted as I made my way to a chair to sit down. I couldn&#39;t eat because of slight nausea and cold chills. I was shaking for about 20 minutes. Eventually, I made it to my bed to lay down, but my legs were shaking as I walked up the stairs. At 6:00 pm, my temperature was 98.8 F. I was freezing a shivering for the next hour in bed under 3 blankets. My hands and feet felt like ice. At 8:00 pm, I had a fever of 100.2  F that lasted all night. My body ached all over, especially at the hips. I couldn&#39;t sit still and couldn&#39;t sleep until 4:00 am. I woke at 8:30 am with some milder aches and fatigue with a temperature of 97.6 F.

                                                After receiving the shot, I was required to sit down for 15 minutes. About 5 minutes in, I started to become dizzy, my vision started blacking out, my hearing was muffled, I became clammy, sweaty, and experienced mental disorientation. It became harder for me to breathe, but I never struggled to take a breath. I drank some water and waited for the symptoms to subside. I remained seated and these symptoms went away within 5 minutes. After feeling better for about 5 minutes, I felt cold and was shivering. The woman sitting next to me was completely fine after her shot. I&#39;ve since felt a slight burning sensation on my skin in areas that I have scratched lightly. I&#39;m also experiencing strange feelings throughout my body- specifically my head, leg, and hand. It feels like I can feel something in each area for a bit and then it subsides after several minutes.

                                                I had the Janssen covid shot yesterday. The shot stung a little and made my arm sore. Later on in the evening I became tired (so far nothing I didn&#39;t assume would happen) so I took a nap. When I woke up, my arm stung worse than when I had the shot and the pain kept shooting up my shoulder into my neck. I went back to sleep, thinking it was just normal vaccine stuff. When I woke up this morning, I had chills, a fever of 101.7, and muscle aches. My body feels like I have a sunburn all over it. My right arm feels like it was stung by a scorpion. I feel dizzy and nauseous, and I have head fog. I feel the exact same way I did when I had COVID19, but with my arm hurting so bad, anything that barely touches it (such as clothes) shoots a stinging pain up my neck

Around 9 pm I started experiencing extreme body aches all over that felt like my body was &#34;fighting&#34; against itself. I also experienced chills. I had a hard time sleeping from the pain. The next morning a headache started and progressed into a migraine. I could not get up or open my eyes from how bad the migraine was. I took extra strength Tylenol for the pain with little relief. On Saturday evening the symptoms started to get better and turned more into a headache. I still had the headache on Sunday but it was better after taking the Tylenol. On Monday my arm is now sore (it wasn&#39;t sore prior).

                                                Around 3:15 in the afternoon, I began experiencing severe aches and muscle pains, combined with a growing migraine. Not realizing what it may be related to, I took two ibuprofen and I&#39;ve acetaminophen.  By the time I around home around 6:30, I could barely hold myself up. I ate dinner, which only helped minimally, and by 8 pm felt like death. My husband notice I looked red and felt my forehead, immediately going for the thermometer. I had a fever of 100.5.  We eventually got me into bed after downing a lot of water, but the pain would not ease up. The pain was too excruciating. At 10:30 my husband came to bed and we took my temp again which was 101.6. To help me sleep I took another Tylenol. At 5:45 my work alarm went off and I checked my temp again; still 101.6. I got a cold pack for my migraine and went back to sleep. Slowly throughout the day my fever dwindled, until it finally broke in the early afternoon. By 4:15, as I am writing this, all that&#39;s left is done tiredness, thirst, and a small bit of achiness.

Woke up at 6:00 AM for my day.  Fever gone, aches still a little there, tired from lack of sleep and a little bit of chills.  It was a rough night but overall feeling good today.

The day after I recieved the covid vaccine Janssen, I started noticing the injection site getting red and swollen. By the next day it had grown in size and was itching rather badly. I could sleep from how badly it was itching and burning. It has been 6 days since I got the vaccine and it&#39;s still large and swollen and really itchy. I have been taking ibuprofen for the pain and using benadryl for the itching.

                                                I received the vaccine at 1:30 pm in the afternoon on 3/22/21 and immediately afterwards I felt fine. I waited my 15 minutes and had no signs of a reaction and was free to go. Later in the afternoon, around 3:15 pm, I began to feel a little fatigued and my arm was sore. Around 6:00 pm that same night, I developed a low grade temp of 99.8, I was very fatigued, had achiness all over, as well as my arm was very warm and tender.  I was unable to sleep through the night of 3/22/21 into 3/23/21 and got out of bed around 4: 30 am on 3/23/21 and had to call into work due to the pain. The pain was not an achiness but sharp throughout my whole body. Around 9:00 am, I took a pain reliever and was able to sleep for a few hours. Upon waking up around 1:30-2:00 pm, I was still hurting and was then nauseated as well. I tried to drink water and ate a few crackers to settle my stomach with no relief. At 5:15 pm on 3/23/21, I went to the bathroom and got in the shower to try to help with the pain. After a few minutes in the shower, I became extremely lightheaded and felt like I was going to be sick. I sat down in the bathtub and hollered for my mother to come help me because at this point, I felt like I needed to go to the hospital. Upon sitting down in the bathtub, I began to profusely vomit and started to lose feeling in my legs. My mother entered the bathroom and I explained what was happening and soon after my hands contracted and were stuck in an abnormal position. The pain was unbearable and I was unable to move them from that position. I was unable to get myself out of the bathtub so my mom then called for an ambulance. These symptoms occurred somewhere around 5:20-5:21 pm and EMS was called at 5:22 pm. After a few minutes, I was able to regain movement of my legs but my hands and fingers were still contracted and unmovable. I was able to help my mother enough to put my clothes on and to make my way outside to the front porch to get fresh air. After getting outside, I was accompanied by my mother and my neighbor whom is a nurse. My neighbor looked at my hands and noticed they were discolored and she attempted to straighten out my fingers to no avail. The pain in my fingers was sharp and excruciating but there was also a pins and needle type pain as well. I remained outside until EMS arrived. I was then transported to Hospital where I was seen in the ER for this. Upon arrival to the ER, the physician ordered labs and fluids and stated that apparently he had seen at least 2 other cases that day with a similar reaction to the vaccine. He explained that I was having an adverse reaction to the vaccine and that my hands should return to normal within 24-48 hours. I was then discharged home. As of 3/24/21, I was able to straighten my left hand out and my right hand, my fingers would straighten out, but they would return to a curled resting position. As of 3/25/21, I returned to work and I have some weakness in both hands with a slight discoloration of each hand as well. I am a nurse and work in an office and the physicians in my office commented on the color of skin upon seeing them. I was still very achy and fatigued. My arm was still sore and tender as well. As of today, 3/26/21, I am still achy as well as tired. My right hand has improved some but still returns to a curled resting position. The color of my hands has improved as well. I am a nurse and have seen many things throughout my career. This experience has been absolutely terrifying and I still have no answers as to why this happened to my body. I did my part by being vaccinated and was terrified that I was going to lose my life to it. I pray this does not happen to anyone else.

                                                Prior to recieving her vaccine , the patient stated she was nervous and has anxiety.  After recieving the vaccine she said she felt fine. I told her to stay there for few minutes make sure she was ok. Her husband was getting the vaccine next so I went to start reviewing his paperwork. 5 minutes later he said she didnt feel good. She said she felt like she was going to pass out and wanted to sit or lay down on the floor. Her husband and I helped lower her to the ground and she lay on her side. I asked if she wanted water or anything she said yes. I got her a cold water and she put it against her forehead and said she just needed a minute.   After 10 minutes she got up and sat in the chair and said she felt better.  I then gave her husband his vaccine.   10 minutes later as they wanted after his he said she did not feel well again. She was laying on the floor and said she did not feel like she woulf pass out but just didnt feel right. I asked if she wanted me to call 911 she said yes, just to be checked out.  They came with in 5 minutes and then she said she felt better and was sitting again.   They talked to her and watched her stand up. They checked her pulse and said it was normal and her color was good. She ended up not going with the ambulance and agreed it was probably jsut anxiety  / panic attack.  She walked away fine and also stated she needed to eat dinner.

                                                My daughter, although has cognitive issues, has not ever displayed any adverse behavior.  We first noticed some unusual behavior on March 31st 2021.  Three days later, on April 3rd, her behavior became more noticeable and unusual for her.  She was saying things that didn&#39;t make any sense and wasn&#39;t sleeping well or not at all.  On Sunday April 4th, her behavior intensified into delusions and hallucinations.  She was talking to people not there and making bizarre statements.  She was taken to emergency hospital late Sunday night and given a blood and urine test and sent home.  By Monday morning, she had not slept the entire night and was shouting out, trying to leave the house and her hallucinations and delusions had intensified.  We took her to Emergency room, where she was diagnosed with psychotic behavior and was admitted to the psychiatric ward.  She is expected to be released today, April 11th, 2021.

                                                At about 9:30 I was looking at my phone. My vision started going blurry. I started seeing flashing lights and could not be around any light. I went to a dark room and about 30 minutes later it stopped where a wasn&#39;t seeing a flashing line.  I took melatonin and went to bed figuring I was starting to get tired.  I woke up at 638am. Arm super sore, a red spot over the size of a quarter at injection site. Low grade 99.1 and my entire body hurts and a small headache. Called in to work to rest for the day.

Restlessness and chills continued throughout the night. At 1:30am I finally took OTC flu/cold liquid medicine. (NyQuil) and then continued DayQuil and NyQuil for the next 48 hours.  Fever began and continued until end of day the following day. Although not as serve once fever reducer was being taken. (24 hours) Body aches that night and continuing into the next day. (24 hours) Headache began the next day and continued for almost 48 hours post injection.  Fatigue that night and continued for two days post injection (48 hours) All around would categorize day one after the inject as &#34;flu-like&#34; although this was a bit worse than when I&#39;ve had the flu. Day 2 post injection was more &#34;cold-like&#34; but higher fatigue than I&#39;m used to.  I normally never get headaches, and I had a dull headache for the two days post injection.

This occurred at the same time as fever (highest 99.4 degrees F) and muscular aches in back and legs. After consulting with doctor, I took a combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen and  half a dose of  metoprolol to lower fever and heart rate.  Experienced a slight headache and had trouble sleeping due to tachycardia.  Tachycardia dissipated 6 hours after onset. All symptoms resolved by 12 PM the next day (approximately 24 hours after injection).

Concerned my bone was hit with a too long vaccine needle. Had chills/fever evening of 4/4/2021 into morning of 4/6/2021?had to take off work. Have had neurological symptoms ongoing with ?brain fogginess? since 4/5/2021. On 4/6/2021, began to see flashes/spots of light in vision of left eye, which worsened through today. Took off afternoon from work and went to an eye clinic to have eye dilated and looked at, but the spots in vision continue through reporting time (4/7/2021, 5pm CT).

                                                12 hours after injection I was shivering freezing using multiple blankets. When I tried to walk I was very dizzy with blurred vision. I had body aches and a severe headache. My temperature was 104.7 with the thermometer. My breathing was as if I worked out but was just sleeping. I called an ambulance and was taken to health center where doctor took over care.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I began to feel nauseous, almost like being car sick while looking at my phone. I also began to feel tightness in my chest. After my 15 minutes were up I asked the administrator of my shot if it was normal that I felt dizzy/chest tightness. They said it was probably fine and just to monitor my  symptoms. I went and sat in my car a few min and I began to feel very strange, it seemed very bright out, I felt weak, and my eyes felt very heavy. I wanted to get home so I started driving but on the highway, my heart beat was very fast and I began to feel like I couldn&#39;t swallow. At one point felt as though I might be about to choke so I pulled over because I thought I was going to have to dial 911 as my throat was feeling like it was closing up. I tried swallowing a few times with great effort and after a few minutes the sensation started to lessen. My throat hadn&#39;t closed up completely, however it did feel like it had swelled up.

My pregnancy has thus far been really easy with no complications.  I had a low grade fever that I took Tylenol to treat.  I had pretty bad muscle and joint pain, chills, and could not stop shaking.  I just felt freezing.  Once my fever broke I felt extremely hot all night.  The next morning I was exhausted and had a lot of the muscle and joint pain still.  I marked on my report that it would&#39;ve stopped me from going about my normal daily activities, as I could not have gone to work and spent most of the day resting.  For the next few days I was tired and my eyes ached.  On Monday and Tuesday I had a headache in the afternoon.  Yesterday afternoon my eyes finally stopped aching and everything seems to be back to normal.

                                                Around 1am (~13 hr after vaccination) I began experiencing severe joint pain in my ankles, knees, hips and spine. Enough to wake me up from my sleep. The pain was also accompanied by chills.  I took Tylenol for the symptoms but the pain did not subside. This morning, at 8:30am the joint pain is still very strong.

                                                I received the vaccine at 36 weeks pregnant. I am estimated to deliver April 16th.  About 8 hours after receiving the vaccine I noticed general bodily discomfort and achiness, as well as a loss of appetite and a headache. About 30 minutes after that I developed chills but no fever, and was fatigued enough to fall asleep an hour before my usual bedtime. I slept terribly in the night due to the achiness and pain at the injection site making it hard to lay on my side, which I have to do for pregnancy. I went to bed with chills but woke up sweating and discovered a fever of 100.2 around 12:45 AM. By 5:30 my temperature was down to 98. The following morning I continue to experience achiness, fatigue, decreased appetite, and a headache. I seem to have felt some pelvic cramping associated with pregnancy but it may be unrelated.

                                                After being administered the vaccine at 7:12 am, when the nurse stood me up and started to walk me to the holding area, I became dizzy, my legs got weak, and there was a loud ringing in my ears. I nearly collapsed as I reached the seat in the holding area they were taking me to. I placed one 0.5MG tablet of my prescription Alprazolam in my mouth and waited for the nurse to bring water. They took me via wheelchair from the holding area to a secluded spot behind a curtain. There, I laid on a cot, received cold water, and a nurse talked to me while I recovered. It felt like I was having an anxiety attack, which has never happened to me after getting a shot before. Fitbit heart rate data shows my heart rate at 105 BPM at 7:00 am (going through the admission process, walking around the facility), 83 BPM at 7:10 am, 79 BPM at 7:15 am, 74 BPM at 7:20 am. Between 8:15 am and 1:25 pm, my heart rate remained between 63 and 89 BPM. My arm was sore and my skin hurt (an issue that I have when I feel very stressed). Additional symptoms arose around 1:35 pm. I began going through cycles of chills, sweating and overheating. My heart rate ranged from 127 BPM and 93 BPM for the remainder of the night. I took Tylenol at 7:07 PM to help with my fever.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Mid Saturday night I woke up to chills and was shaking so bad I couldn&#39;t fall back asleep even after adding another layer of clothes and blanket. Sunday morning I was still very cold and tired from not sleeping. I developed body aches but they were everywhere not just my arm. I was very fatigued and didn&#39;t have an appetite. The worst part was getting a migraine with extreme light sensitivity. I couldn&#39;t stand to be around any windows without blinds. I spent the day in my bedroom sleeping with the curtains closed and an eye mask on. By that night, the migraine had subsided but I was adding hot flashes to the problem list. Had a pretty restless night again on Sunday. Woke up Monday to the light sensitivity back but not as severe. I took the day off work because I couldn&#39;t handle looking at a computer screen all day. By about 1pm I was feeling mostly back to normal. My arm is still sore near the injection site and I&#39;m a bit fatigued at times but those are the only things remaining.

                                                Felt fantastic until 7 hours after the shot at 5pm on 3/13/21. Then body aches began followed by fever (100.7 taken by ear) and then headache. Headache and body aches became intense by 6:20pm on the day I received the vaccine. I took Tylenol Extra strength which helped the body aches and lowered the fever a bit but did little for the headache. Chills started around 10pm accompanied by vomiting and severe diarrhea at 1am. Blood pressure spiked at 142/101 shortly after third vomiting episode. Called family to take me to ER but didn?t end up going because I was able to get vomiting and blood pressure under control by 3am. Figured doctors would just hook me up to an IV of fluids and send me on my way anyway, not something I can afford. No more fever or chills since 4am on 3/14/21. Headache and diarrhea and slight nausea still persisting 29 hours after the shot. Treating symptoms with Tylenol, water, pedialyte, chicken broth, and toast diet. Unable to care for my children, worst I?ve felt in years. Regularly get the flu shot with no side effects.

Chills lasted for hours and couldn&#39;t stop shaking, so took Tylenol at 12:15am. Around 1:00am the chills subsided. Around 2:00am fever burnt off, sweating and hot. Couldn&#39;t sleep the rest of the night. Slept from 8am-10am and woke with just headache. Took Tylenol around 10:30am to help with headache and it did start to subside. Was mostly fatigued and muscle aches the rest of the day until 6pm when I started to get cold again. Feels like the fever and chills are coming back and it&#39;s currently 7:30pm, so assuming it&#39;ll be another night of this.

Around 12:30AM I felt feverish, and body aches, severe headache and chills that woke me up. Took Tylenol. Felt like I had the flu. Next day kept treating with Tylenol as needed and the fatigue, body aches and low energy persisted along with headache but by night time I was feeling somewhat  better. Next day I was much better that I could work from home. Still felt a little fatigued other symptoms subsided.

At around 6pm I started to get a headache, I took 2 tylenol but it continued to get progressively worse. By 7 I was starting to get really fatigued and fell asleep. I woke up around 8 or 9 still fatigued with body aches and a headache. The body aches and headache continued to worsen, but due to pregnancy I could not take any more tylenol. Around midnight I got out of bed to use the bathroom and immediately started violently shivering. It continued for a few minutes after I got back into bed, it did cause a lot of pain in my joints and muscles. A few hours later I woke up very hot and sweaty. The next day (Thursday) I continued to feel very fatigued with body aches and a headache to the point where I had to stop working even though I work from home. The following day (Friday) I was still mildly fatigued and had some body aches, and my brain felt very foggy so I took off work again. I regularly checked my temperature during this time and did not have a fever.

                                                I was fine from 10am until 3:30pm on the day of injection. I started to feel feverish and chills at 3:30 and it progressed into a 99.2 fever with all over body aches and a headache and chills. I took alkasletzer cold medicine with Tylenol in it to help with the fever. It got the symptoms down where I could move and stood in the hot shower for 30 minutes to help warm me up. I felt slightly better and still had fever symptoms and severe body aches. I started feeling unable to move due to the fever symptoms again around 9pm and took 2 extra strength Tylenol that eventually worked and I had some nausea with that. I hadn?t been able to eat because of the symptoms and the nausea could have been from taking meds on an empty stomach. I finally felt able to eat around 10pm and had some food and went to bed. I could barley sleep all night and was tossing and turning due to fever. My nose started to get runny around 10pm before I went to bed. I woke up the next day and still had the fever symptoms, body aches and the worst headache I have ever had, a 10 on the pain scale. I took another 2 extra strength Tylenol and went to sleep for 2 hours. I woke up and could tell the fever had broken and my head was still in pretty severe pain- about a 7 on the pain scale.  I was incredibly fatigued the entire day and felt hot and cold throughout the day. I was incredibly weak and needed a lot of rest. I still didn?t sleep well through the night and woke up friday feeling fatigued. I expended some energy in the am at the dog park and had to sleep for 3 hours during the day which is atypical for me. I woke up Saturday morning (today) still feeling a headache and exhaustion. I will see how the rest of the day goes and am hoping to feel better and don?t know when the symptoms will stop.

The biggest symptoms I had were severe body aches, debilitating chills, fluctuating fever, headache, and no appetite.  4/1/21: * 11:15am: Vaccine administered * 12pm-6pm: Arm soreness, feeling cold/experiencing some chills, minor headache and stomach ache (I felt a little off but couldn?t tell if it was real or in my head) * 5:30pm: I walk home from work, which takes about about 35 minutes. Regret the decision about 10 mins from home due to onset body aches and fatigue  * 6pm: I go straight to bed freezing with crippling chills, body aches, and a headache * 8pm: Extreme nausea kicks in, I take Advil and cannot stomach more than one bite of food; still experiencing chills and body pain * 9pm: 100.7 fever, the chills subside and I start to get hot * 10:15pm: I finally eat some food, drink more water, body still aches, start to get chilly again  * 10:45pm: My fever is down to 99.3, my ears really hurt, like, ear-infection-style pain  * 11:15pm: 12ish hours post-vaccine, I have severe body aches, I alternate between really hot and cold, take more Advil and go to bed (finally fall asleep at midnight)  4/2/21: * 6:15am: Wake up; I spent the night tossing and turning with extreme night sweats. At this point I still have a pretty bad headache and painful body aches, specifically in my lower back and legs; fall back asleep * 8am-9am: Wake up and take more Advil. My whole body hurts. Toss and turn for a bit more. Small fever?99 degree temperature. Make coffee but have absolutely no appetite. * 9am-10am: So sweaty, fever is fully breaking * 11am: No more fever, slight headache, and body aches seem to be subsiding * 11:45am: Almost exactly 24 hours later and feeling good, comparatively speaking. Finally eat a bagel * 5:30pm: After lunch, I took a nap. My body aches have completely subsided, no fever. I still have a small headache and my ears still ache. But overall, I feel pretty normal! Just a little tired but probably from lack of sleep last night.

I have had no complications so far in my pregnancy. On the day after receiving the vaccine, I developed a severe headache, congestion, dehydration, and fatigue. I felt feverish and had chills, but I did not have a fever. I was unable to go about my daily activities (I was not working on this day). These symptoms went away about 36 hours after being vaccinated. I also had pain at the injection site.

                                                Yesterday I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I was the last appointment, so they observed me for 5 minutes, and I left. After riding in the car for a few minutes, I noticed that I was having a hard time breathing and my throat felt like it was starting to swell. By that time, the clinic was closed, so I went to the emergency room just in case and sat in my car since they didn&#39;t allow people to sit in the waiting room because if covid.  It started becoming increasingly difficult to breathe, and I was feeling more and more swelling of my throat and tongue. I was having a lot of dizziness, nausea, facial flushing, palpitations, and some mild confusion. I then started getting numbness in the bottom half of my face. Over time, the numbness spread, mostly staying on the left side of my body (face, scalp, lower arms and legs, left side on tongue and inside of mouth). I also started getting a prickling burning pain sensation for brief periods of time where I had numbness. I had decided that if my breathing worsened at all, I would go to the er even though I can&#39;t afford it.   After about an hour and a half, my breathing started to feel less constricted and like there was less resistance. The swelling in my throat was mostly in the upper throat where I had difficulty swallowing but not as much difficulty breathing. The numbness continued to get worse and was sometimes disappearing and reappearing in the same spot.  At 9:30 pm we went to go get some benadryl. I continued feeling less and less swelling and having an easier time breathing. At that point, I went home. Once I was home, my breathing continued to improve and the numbness started to dissipate.  In the middle of the night, I started itching and getting widespread hives and getting a sharp burning pricking pain that would last a few seconds in different areas. The numbness also started coming back mostly in my face. I continued to have difficulty swallowing.  I am feeling much better today. I still feel some slight swelling in my throat when I swallow, but my breathing is fine. I&#39;m still itchy and occasionally breaking out in hives. Im having mild lower facial numbness. I&#39;m also starting to get the normal side effects of fever, headache, arm soreness, and body aches. I&#39;m taking benadryl every 4 hours.

                                                About a minute after I had the injection, my arm started hurting and it felt like hot water was coursing through my veins. I got an immediate headache that progressed into light headedness, my vision got blurry and I saw colors and then I started to lose my hearing, it felt like there was cotton in my ears. The nurses said I went pale and they called it a panic attack, but it was unlike any panic attack I have ever had in my life. I?ve had my TDAP updated a few years ago and got a flu shot and did not feel anything like this. I was rolled out of the room on a wheel chair because I was too dizzy to walk and then threw up several times into a bag and peed myself. It took about 20 minutes before I felt normal again.   The following day my arm felt numb and incredibly sore, I couldn?t raise it that far up without excruciating pain. I felt weak, fatigued and dizzy and was unable to use the bathroom. I had fever sweats and chills on and off. I was not able to sleep well, but I think that?s because of the pain in my arm.

                                                From probably 9pm till 8am I was freezing cold with crawling skin and flu-like symptoms. I wasn?t tired though, just so freezing cold and sore all over. I couldn?t sleep because the discomfort was so bad. I was probably 70 degrees in my house and I was in fleece pajamas and had 3 blankets and was still freezing all night. No fever though, oddly.

Started experiencing fogginess and feeling cold at 1:00 am 20Mar2021. Went to bed at 1:00 and dreamed of being sick until waking up at 8:30 am 20Mar2021. Woke up and was very weak (could not push toothpaste through toothpaste tube), almost passed out in trying, so I sat on the floor. Tried getting back to bed and was extremely nauseous and started vomiting. After that, I had the sweats/fever/chills for a couple hours (until ~11:00am), and was fatigued until 4:00 pm. Spent most of the day sleeping, unable to do anything. Today, 22Mar2021, feel slight tingling on palm of left hand and fingers. Injection site is still sore and bruised

When I woke up in the morning I had a headache, muscle aches, slight difficulty breathing with chest heaviness, and fatigue.  At 2 am on March 8 I awoke with dizziness and room spinning, sweating, weakness and lightheadedness, and nausea. Later that morning most of the symptoms subsided except for slight lightheadedness. By March 9 all side effects had resolved.

                                                I received the vaccine at 9am on Saturday, March 6th. My arm was immediately very sore throughout the day. Around 9:30pm that night I began to feel nauseous. As the night progressed my symptoms got worse. I experienced intense chills and by 11pm had a 100 degree fever. Sunday, March 7th my fever had decreased, but I continued to feel nauseous and have chills throughout the day. Additionally I felt extremely fatigued, weak, and had a throbbing headache. Completing simple tasks were difficult and exhausting. Monday, March 8th I continue to experience significant fatigue, headache, and muscle weakness, but at less intensity. Also, my right arm where I received the injection is very sore. I have also been somewhat dizzy today. I have been taking Advil, drinking fluids, using an ice pack, and resting as much as I can as part of the treatment.

                                                About 6 hours after receiving the Janssen shot, I came down with a fever, muscle aches and chills. My fever peaked at about midnight with a temperature of 101.8. At that point, I took two Tylenol. Had a rough night and didn&#39;t sleep well. Continued taking Tylenol the following day to manage the low grade fever. I seem to back mostly back to normal today (two days after receiving the vaccine), however I do still have soreness in my left arm where I got the shot and some residual aches and pains.

Half way through second day I broke out in a rash all over my chest, tummy, and back. Entering into day 3 ( today ) I do feel better, but can&#39;t shake the brain fog and feelings of being tired. Rash is still present currently.

Waking up on 3/28/21 (day two after shot) my low grade fever was gone and symptoms are mostly gone. Just a slightly sore arm.

At 9 too Ibuprofin and fever was still at 102.1. Also had insomnia. Finally around 11 nausea subsided as well as chills but was still very achy and couldn?t sleep. I am better this morning, just very tired, slight headache and slight achy.

                                                Numbness in throat 5 minutes after injection.   Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored but nothing substantial to report.   Monitored for a total of 30 minutes, numbness spread through mouth yet did not progress further.  Dizziness upon standing.  No additional symptoms.  Healthcare providers noted that if any progression of symptoms occur to report to the emergency room, however, no additional care was needed.     8-10 days post vaccine severe stomach pains after each meal.  Possibly related to skipping dose of methotrexate.  Pain alleviated within hours once methotrexate injection was administered.  Discussed with rheumatologist at scheduled appointment.

First day after felt slightly better, still tired and slightly light headed. Second day symptoms worsened, feeling like I was going to pass out/faint, hot/cold chills, clammy, no fever, shortness of breath, culminating in numbness and tingling in arms, legs, then chest and then hands freezing up which resulted in a panic attack. Have never had a panic attack before. Emergency services called and after checking gave a sedative and went to the ER.

                                                The night of 3/9/21  following the vaccination I had fever, chills, sweating, severe body aches and pains (all over) and nightmares Wednesday morning I was unable to go to work and remained in bed sleeping all but approximately 2 hours in the afternoon  because I was still in pain and had headache/fever/chills/muscle and joint pain. I also had no appetite. I was awake long enough to eat one bowl of cereal and a small apple sauce cup so that I could take more meds without upsetting my stomach. Wednesday night 3/10 my temperature was still at 99.3. I was still having body soreness and headaches (sinus). Thursday morning 3/11 I still had the headache and body soreness but no more fever. I was still feeling unwell but could at least get out of bed and function. By late Thursday most of the symptoms subsided and I started feeling better. Friday morning I was no longer having symptoms.  It was the initial symptoms Tuesday night and Wednesday that concerned me the most because it hit me so severely and fast. The pharmacist warned me of possible side effects that would require over the counter medication, but in my case that did not suffice. I was physically unable to do anything but sleep which is highly unusual for me, and my entire body was in more pain than I?ve ever experienced.

                                                At the time of my vaccine I was 30 weeks pregnant. My expected date of delivery is 5/18/21 and I have had no issues/complications with this pregnancy.   I received my vaccine on 3/9  at 4:00 PM, and stayed to be monitored for  30 minutes due to my pregnancy, After the vaccine, Per the clinics recommendation, I drank lots of fluids the rest of the day. Several hours later I noticed I had a minor headache. I Consulted with my OBGYN and took 650mg of Tylenol before going to bed. By midnight when I layed down(and throughout the remainder of the night - till about 7am) I had moderate body aches - especially in my legs. I also felt feverish with chills and at times sweating, but had no actual fever. I checked on three sperate occasions between 12AM and 7AM. I was unable to sleep that night.   The following day (3/10) I felt tired, had some lingering body aches (though not as bad as the night before) and a minor headache that would come and go throughout the day. I also had minor arm pain at the injection site - nothing different then a flu shot. continued to drink lots of fluids and took  Tyelnol as needed.   When I woke up on 3/11, I felt perfectly fine. No headache, body aches, arm pain, etc.

I had sweatpants, two sweatshirts, slippers and 2 blankets on to help. Later on I had fallen asleep to wake my husband to uncontrollable laughter and crying, mentally I knew what I was doing was not right but I couldn&#39;t control it. I believe my feve may had spiked so high that it was border line hysteria. By morning I woke and the fever had broke however I still had no appetite, terrible headache along with weakness and fatigue....I also tried food but ended up spitting it out because everything tasted strongly of metal. Sunday I was back to tasting to food and more energy.

By 6:30pm, I was down for the count with the cold sweats, diarrhea, headache and vertigo like symptoms (dizzy when standing or moving). Tylenol was taken for fever and water and Gatorade is all that was drank for the remainder of the night. When awaking around 8am the next morning,  fever was gone as well as chills. headache and dizziness remained. Around 1pm, toast and oatmeal was eaten and started feeling more normal again. by 5pm was fine, just tired and sore still.

I had chills, body aches, fever, elevated heart rate,  heat flashes, and headache throughout the whole night. I could not sleep due to anxiety, which I don?t have normally. It was beyond miserable. It lasted a little over 48 hours. None of the symptoms were mild.

                                                I got the shot Saturday afternoon. My side effects started around 9:30 with chills?I just couldn?t get warm. I drifted off to sleep all right around 10:30, but by midnight, my legs were on fire like I?d just run a marathon. I?m pretty sure I had a fever because I was sweating and tossing and turning for what seemed like hours. By 4:00, I had a massive headache and felt like I was going to throw up. I took Advil and Zofran at 4 and went back to bed. Sunday I still battled headache, aches, and fatigue. The fatigue is what&#39;s still lingering yesterday and today.

Major fatigue but unable to sleep because of intensity and discomfort of symptoms. Outbreak of new aphthous ulcers in mouth. Contacted physician to ask if I could take acetaminophen or ibuprofen to lower fever and get relief from joint pain - was advised both were safe to use. Took acetaminophen. Major symptoms resolved after 48 hours, but some general fatigue, loss of appetite, and night sweats continued for approximately 1 week post-vaccine.

Burning stinging pain continues today along with a slight itchiness and a very pronounced red spot. At first you couldn?t tell where I had gotten the shot and daily the red spot grows bigger and feels hot in temperature. It also feels swollen.  The red spot  has grown to the size of 5 inches  in diameter. Slight nausea the first day of injection. Along with genera malaise.

                                                Within 9 hours I had fever, chills, fatigue. When I woke up the next morning both of my eyes were swollen. I took ceterizine and Benadryl with no relief. I missed the following Monday of work due to my eyes still be swollen. My lips started swelling by Wednesday. Only one side of my upper lip would swell at a time or one side of my lower lip. By they following Saturday my lips were still swelling at any given time. Monday March 29 my  bottom lip started swelling at 1:45 pm and by 2:30 pm both eyes were swollen. I had tremendous pain behind my left eye which caused me to go to the Emergency room. I was given IV meds and had prescriptions ons waiting for me at the pharmacy the next day. My eyes were still swollen the following Tuesday the 30th. I am on a steroid and to antihistamines to help prevent this from happening again along with Benadryl, ibuprofen for pain.

My arm was immediately tingly and numb simultaneously, and I felt...light and weird. Around 2p, I began feeling feeling lightheaded and weak, and at 6p, I had chills, severe weakness, dizziness and nausea. I couldn&#39;t stand up longer than 2 minutes without wanting to vomit and faint. I couldn&#39;t even stand up long enough to wash dishes, prepare a bowl of grapes to eat or shower. Throughout the night, I sweated so terribly from the chills to the point that my bed was soaked to the mattress pad, and currently at 2:02p on April 6th, I&#39;m still experiencing the extreme weakness, nausea, and chills.

Patient then ate a snickers bar in her purse and felt better, stating she must have felt uneasy because she had not eaten and was also a bit anxious after getting her shot. Patient walked out of the pharmacy at the end of her observation period saying she felt fine and was going home. Upon calling the patient 12 hours later on her cell to see how she was doing, the patient said she was fine, and no change since she left the pharmacy this morning.

                                                Approximately 9 hours after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA, I experienced sudden fatigue followed by onset of severe muscle and joint pain including severe head pain followed by severe chills followed by fever and excessive sweating. I was very dizzy and felt disoriented. I was in bed when all this happened and was already wearing warm clothes under the covers. The muscle and joint pain was so severe, I couldn&#39;t grip anything including my cell phone (my wrists were in sharp pain). The head pain was so severe I was sensitive to light regardless of how dim it was. I felt like my toes were curled, but that could have been me &#34;bracing&#34; and tightening up due to the total body pain. I could move very little. It was very strange. These symptoms persisted through the night. The following morning at around 9am, I still had a very bad headache that made me nauseated and continued to be sensitive to light. Some of the joint and muscle pain tapered down enough for me to get out of bed to go potty but it was exhausting to walk 5 feet to the bathroom and then get back in bed. I still ran a mild fever. At around 1pm I took a Tylenol that helped subside the symptoms but felt wiped out all day. By the following day (Monday), I was feeling better getting more energy and by that Monday evening, I felt like nothing ever happened. I&#39;m sure these just fall into perhaps the more severe level of the side effects, but I was frightened by the intense sharp muscle and joint pain to the point I couldn&#39;t even grip anything.

I also got dizzy and lightheaded. The girl in the car next to me had waved over one of the attendants as well because she was feeling weird too. I got home and had the worst headache I&#39;ve ever had and felt flu like symptoms and very weak. The next day at work I was so sick I had to go home. I was puking and had diarrhea  over and over for a few hours. I also felt lightheaded and dizzy and weak. Also had the headache. I was getting chills as well once I got home. Today I just feel very weak and just &#34;off&#34;.

About 10 minutes after the shot, she came back to the pharmacy and reported she was not feeling right.  She was extremely tired, weak, and dizzy.  She was told to sit down for further observation and given a bottle of water.  About 5 minutes later, she said she was still feeling really bad.  She said she was not thinking clearly and didn&#39;t feel right. She was also experiencing moderate pain down her spine.  She said her thinking was so affected that she wanted to seek treatment.   Patient declined offer to call EMS, and proceeded to an urgent care clinic next door.  Urgent care later called the pharmacy to inform us that patient had been transported to the hospital by ambulance.

                                                Immediately after I got it I felt different. Fight or flight response kicked in. My heart started racing and chest felt tighter. It felt like I just ran a marathon. My breathing increased and I felt very dizzy and lightheaded. I stayed in the store and walked around hoping symptoms wouldn&#39;t get worse for 25 minutes then left. I had my three small children with me and wanted to get them home. I called my husband who is a physician and told him everything I was experiencing. He told me to stay in the store to see how things went. I then drove home to monitor my symptoms. I had post nasal drip and it exacerbated over the next few weeks. I was on two different antibiotics because it felt like I had a bad ear infection. It never went away. I saw an ENT and my tympanaplasty that I had as a child blew. I have a large hole in my ear drum currently and very dizzy. I am getting a CT of my ear this Wednesday and I will have to have surgery in the next few months for another tympanoplasty.

Because it would make me more nauseated.  Terrible headache I fell asleep earlier in the afternoon I had to hold my Stomach and even turning in bed led to more nausea.  Finally fell asleep  dor the night woke up so far today I don?t feel nauseated I do feel dehydrated and I tried to drink Gatorade but drinking  from a cup aggravates it so only like ice chips or popsicles don?t aggravate my stomach    I felt like I was dying just laying on the floor for hours I laid on the. Ahg room floor because the tile was cool and I was near the toilet.  I tested positive for covid asymptomatic in October and then positive again in December with mild symptoms.  I never fully regained sense of smell or taste only partially even though that was months ago.  I wouldn?t wish that vaccine reaction in anyone   I was hesitant sins with already had covid to get vaccinated but was encouraged to do so.  I definitely won?t do that again ever.  It wasn?t that bad actually having COVID that was way worse.

Woke up 20 min later, chills and body symptoms continued to worsen. Got very bad, could not get off the couch, in lots of pain. Nausea started. Light headache, Lasted for about 6 hours until I decided to take Tylenol and a bath. This helped immensely! After the bath I got very warm, burning up. Slept some and the next day felt significantly better. Light body aches and headache, tired. Back to almost 100% two days later/48 hrs.

I had chills and my teeth were actually chattering at one point it was so bad. This gradually got worse as the evening went on. With it I also started feeling weak and fatigued. By 8pm I started to have a headache. Throughout the night symptoms worsened and I had a fever and more serious headache. My head was pounding so badly. I couldn&#39;t sleep at all. I also had a couple hot flashes to where I woke up sweating. Then I would feel frozen again. The nausea started during the night too. I thought I would throw up but didn&#39;t. At one point my heart was racing so fast I was a little concerned something bad would happen to me and contemplated going to the hospital. By morning I felt a little better, still nauseous and with a bad headache. My body was a little weak. These symptoms lasted all day Thursday. By that Friday morning I only had a little weakness and slight headache. By mid day Friday I was pretty much back to normal.

I continued running that temperature for a few hours and then  around 10am on 3-25-2021 I woke up and took my temperature and it dropped to 102.1. I fluctuated between 101.5 and 102.1 for rest of that day and by 3-26-2021 my temperature was back to normal. I had other common side effects with the fever but that was my only concern was the high fever.

EMS was called, she was evaluated.  She was not transported and was released to go home after evaluation and complete resolution of her symptoms. I spoke with her today, she states she had a similar episode after her nasal piercing 2 years ago and she believes related to anxiety.  She states other than arm soreness and muscle aches today, no other symptoms persist.

I developed a fever and my sinuses got really stuffy.  I began to throw up profusely which made all symptoms from other issues occur causing me to swell all over and because I couldnt take any meds or keep anything down I went to the ER.   While there I began wheezing and experiencing SOB which still is an issue today.  I have foggy moments where my brain seems so foggy that I am having issues with my short term memory.  I was administered IV fluids, IV morphine and IV ibuphropen to help with the symptoms and was hospitalized for less than a day further evaluation

                                                I started experiencing flu-like symptoms at around 5 PM on 3/14/21.  I was feverish and had chills, muscle aches, and a headache.  I had very strong chills for a few hours and then I noticed that my resting heart rate was around 128 bpm at around 1:30 AM on 3/15/21.  I was running a 100.6 fever at that time.  My fever subsided in the morning and the headache persisted throughout the day, and I was very tired as I did not get much sleep the night before.  I did not work that day (Monday, 3/15).  At the time I was about 7 weeks pregnant.  I noticed some very light spotting later in the day on 3/15, and then I continued spotting on 3/16.  I consulted a midwife at the  facility at 4 PM on 3/16/21 and took a blood test to measure my hCG hormone levels.  The following day, 3/17, I received the results that I had a normal level of hCG hormone and normal hemoglobin levels.  As the day continued, the spotting turned into bleeding, and eventually the bleeding became heavy starting around 4 PM.  I received an ultrasound on 3/18/21 at 8 AM and later spoke with a midwife from facility at 11 AM that day, confirming that there was no viable pregnancy detected via ultrasound.  I had lost quite a bit of blood at that point.  I am, as of 8:35 PM on Friday,  March 19th, still bleeding and experiencing the impact of miscarriage.

                                                Approx 12 after shot I woke up feeling very ill and nauseous. As I walked to the restroom to vomit I lost 100% of my vision, I became very disoriented and had the loudest screeching in both ears. I screamed for my husband and I caught me as I was taken to the floor with no mobility. The episode last several minutes before he was able to move me back to bed. I had severe sweating and ear ringing. As I report this I still have a lingering brain fog and ear ringing.  I reported it to my physician and told to go to the ER if any reoccurrence of reaction.

I reported on the v-safe&#39;s daily check-in that one day I was totally exhausted and had to take a nap. I slept for about 2 hours. The exhaustion was akin to the first semester of pregnancy exhaustion when you can barely stay awake. I was fine after. The exhaustion was significant enough that I could not focus on work, so I decided to nap. On the v-safe reporting, I indicated that this &#34;interferred with my daily work&#34; or whatever that category of assessing the impact is. The agency staff who reached out to me after for details asked that I fill out this form and submit it. I do not remember the exact date of the exhaustion but, if possible to match my v-safe checklist with this report, it is available there. I believe it was 3/16.

                                                I have a history of anaphylaxis, and disclosed that to the medics so they watched me more carefully, which was good, as while I did not experience anything that severe, I did immediately get itchy, turn red and feel quite nauseated. However,  after they monitored me awhile, I told them I felt okay to go home. The next day I had the expected mild flu-like symptoms, which I anticipated. However, what?s been atypical is they returned tenfold three days later. This time with a much higher fever (103), severe chills, fatigue, a seemingly never-ending headache,  muscle spasms,  chest palpitations and suddenly I am experiencing asthma (which is typically seasonal) and am coughing, too.  I?m now a week past when I was vaccinated and each day was feel worse, not better. I have had to cancel my clients and hire a sitter to care for my kids as I am too weak and ill to do it.  I looked up common reactions and nothing states chest pain and/or asthma, nor that it should last this long. That said, as I am high-risk, I work from home and homeschool both of my young kids. Thus, I have been nowhere aside from the vaccine site. Moreover, my partner, our kids and sitter get routinely tested for me,  and everyone is negative. Thus, it appears I am having prolonged, heightened side-effects much more intense than the ?mild? flu-like symptoms otherwise reported, which is concerning. I took no medication prior to receiving the vaccine, either.

Burning feeling at injection site continued for several hours.  Brain fog and chills set in within 2 hours post injection.  Fatigue, headache, and joint stiffness and pain started about 4 hours post injection.  Injection was given on left arm; left hand became painful about 4 hours post injection, as though someone had put it in a vice.  Joint pain worsened.  Upon laying down to sleep, I became so cold I could not get warm even with an electric blanket on high.  Started to feel stabbing pains in my jaw, back of my neck and down behind my shoulder blade on my left side.  Headache worsened and started to feel pressure in my ears.  Joints, my knees in particular, felt like they were made of gravel and someone was stabbing them with a hot poker.  Did not sleep due to pain.  Has been 20 hours post vaccine, injection site is still very painful and swollen.  Joint pain, headache, fatigue and chills continue.  Was unable to go to work today.

I shivered and sweated for 12 hours overnight with a severe headache. I tossed most of the night and had to get up to pee 3 times throughout the night - which is extremely uncommon. By 24 hours after the injection, I still had a strong headache and was mostly able to regulate my body temp. By 36 hours after, I felt tired but no longer had a headache or chills. My injection site is red, raised and very tender.

Couldn?t open eyes or move fingers.  Light headed...blacking out when I got up to go the bathroom.  Couldn?t have any sounds (like tv) on.  Just needed to lay still and sleep.    The above lasted 19 hours.    Then my temperature ended.  I had trouble walking and standing for another 20 hours. No stamina.   I went to work near the end of this and noticed I had trouble looking at my paperwork and figuring what to do for my job.  Not sure if this was still the fatigue just in a different way.  Then it disappeared.

Arm is still sensitive 5 days later but tolerable.  *Seems that if a person with a headache disorder gets the shot, this may be the biggest challenge to combat, in my opinion, and that should be made more aware to public.

The patient stated that immediately after receiving the vaccination, she felt a shooting pain in the injection site. The patient stated that within a few minutes, she felt lightheaded and nauseous. The patient then stated that within 20 minutes, she felt like she was having an asthma attack and had to use her rescue inhaler (albuterol HFA). It was reported that the patient left the pharmacy about 45 minutes after receiving the vaccination and the patient stated she was feeling better. The patient the reported to the pharmacy that the morning of April 7, 2021 that her symptoms of shortness of breath and wheezing returned and she went to an emergency room for treatment. The patient stated that after admission into the ER, the medical staff performed two EKGs and one chest X-ray, which were unremarkable. The patient stated she received treatment with Duoneb because she was wheezing and and treatment with IV methylprednisolone because her throat and tongue appeared swollen. The patient stated she was discharged on April 7, 2021 and was prescribed albuterol solution for nebulization and prednisone 10 mg tablets.

Around 11 PM, I began to experience chills. Around midnight, I developed a pounding headache. Around 1 AM, I began to experience muscle pain. Around 2 AM, I began to experience nausea and sweating. Around 3 AM, I experienced tachycardia, with a pulse rate of between 110 and 120 beats per minute while lying down. Throughout the time, I was lying in bed but not sleeping. I was unable to work the next day and spent most of it in bed.

This morning now my joints no longer hurt, but I still have the headache.
