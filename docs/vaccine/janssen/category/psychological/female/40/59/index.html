                                                Dizzy, run down two hours after injection. Woke up 4 am then off and on with extreme body pain, sore neck , lower back, right hand and arm. Headache and fatigue at 6:45 am got up with two children (2 yrs and 10 months) ate small breakfast by 9 am I couldn?t get off the couch or stay awake. My head started aching and my eyes hurt, I felt extreme chills two thick blankets weren?t enough to warm me. Extreme fatigue, stomach pain and loss of appetite. I fell asleep and didnt have the energy to walk to my bed until 2:30 pm.  It set off my stomach and I was vomiting off and on until around 9 pm. By then I could keep little bits of fluid and food down. Then I was hot. I felt flushed but had no fever. My usual heart rate is 52-54 bpm via Watch while laying down. My heart rate during this hot period laying in bed was 102 -101 bpm. Which is consistent for my workout heart rate. I went to sleep and woke up 7 am with my kids and was well enough to take care of them but not do all my usual chores. I couldn?t bend down or put my head lower than chest or the extreme throbbing headache was back. Still had body aches and fatigue but nowhere near yesterday. It is 11:22 pm Sunday and I feel spent.

                                                patient received Janssen Covid 19 vaccine at our clinic inside store. pt was waiting in waiting area for 15 minutes and she informed us she was not feeling well and felt like passing out. She had been waiting less than 10 minutes.  I went to her and she said she was feeling very strange and was nauseous. I tried to get her up but she couldn&#39;t walk so I let her sit back down. She was not able to communicate with me but was conscious. She said her vision was distorted. her lips started to turn blue and I continued to monitor her. I called 911 and she said she was having difficulty catching her breath so I went for the epipen and gave her 0.3 mg in the outer thigh of her right leg. her color started to improve and she was able to comunicate better. I followed EMS instructions and continued to monitor her until they arrived.

                                                A few seconds after vaccine was given I had a sensation go up my left jawline that felt similar to a nerve pain.  I didn&#39;t think much of it and waited the 10 minutes after my vaccine and had no other symptoms.  I left the pharmacy and started driving home and had a sudden sensation of a heaviness in my chest and trouble taking a deep breath.  I also felt like my tongue and throat were swelling slightly.  I had a warm sensation throughout the middle of my back that felt like a heating pad was on it.  I felt light-headed and called my husband.  As I continued to drive my symptoms worsened and I called 911.  I made it home in my car and the ambulance met me there.  My husband called the pharmacy to ask them what we should do and they said that it would be ok for him to give me Benadryl.  I took 15mL of liquid Benadryl shortly before the ambulance arrived.   Within 15-20 minutes, I felt like I was able to swallow better.  In the ER, I received IV Benadryl and Famotidine.  I was also given 800mg of Ibuprofen for a bad headache I developed.  My oxygen level remained in the high 90&#39;s and my symptoms were much improved after the IV medication.  I was instructed to continue taking Benadryl capsules for the next few days along with Pepcid to keep my symptoms from flaring back up.  I noticed this morning when waking up that the left side of my face as well as my throat felt odd so I took the Pepcid and Benadryl and symptoms were relieved in 30 mins or so.

                                                I felt light headedness right away. The night that I got the injection, I felt kind of drunk. I felt like I had too much alcohol. I am very sensitive to things. I felt silly - loose - tired.  In the night, I had aches and chills - no fever. The next day I felt achy and really really tired. I had a pain at the injection site. That evolved into a left side migraine (the achiness and fatigue and pain from shot) It created tension up my arm and up my neck - and I did get nausea with the headache - on Saturday. Sunday, I felt a little bit better but energy was still low - unusual tiredness; couldn&#39;t exercise as I felt a heavy fatigue. On Sunday, I went to a dance class but it was difficult as I was tired. On Monday, I felt a tiny bit better but still fatigued and did another dance class which went a little better. On Monday evening, I felt like I did the night of the injection - a little loopy and &#34;drunk like.&#34; Monday night, I woke up with a Fiery, achy, itchy, burning rash on both of my arms and the tops of my legs. If I would itch it, it would exaggerate it. When I woke up the next day - the rash went everywhere in my body - it would come and go in different places - neck, face, down and up my legs and feet and on my butt. Pretty much every spot had the rash at one time or another. It was really bad on Tuesday morning, I called the doctor. Was treated with Benadryl and cortisone cream which helped with the symptoms. Tuesday night, it was excruciating - it was all up and down my legs, arms, neck and face and stomach and rear end and feet. It was very achy, burning and itchy - very intense. It would hurt if I scratched it. Accompanied with really intense fatigue. Wednesday, after taking Benadryl, I woke up and it was a tiny bit better. It was still on my legs, neck and face. Sometimes my arms would flare up and sometimes they wouldn&#39;t. Any kind of exertion - like my dance class - would trigger the rash - so I took a break from exercising that week.  It started getting incrementally better - very slowly. Still there on Thursday - still fatigued and I was still taking Benadryl. Friday, also. Saturday, it was pretty much gone but it would threaten to come back and I felt itchiness in my legs when I went for a walk. It still feels a little lingering - my legs are itchy. I&#39;m still building back my energy. Incrementally my energy is increasing. Still not 100% there but it&#39;s getting better day by day.  Note: My history with my skin: I do get flare ups when I get bug bites and when I get poison ivy - I have very sensitive skin.

Administered Toradol and IV fluids, discharged me with good vitals, but still tachycardia, headache, and vomiting. The next day (3/20), I still had a bad headache and could  not keep liquids down. I vomited perhaps 12 times, then called the doctor. She sent me to Urgent Care to receive injections of Toradol and Phenergan. Within the hour, I  could drink. Then shortly after, I  could eat. I  felt better for one day. The next day (3/22), my heart started pounding, and I was unable to sleep horizontally. I  needed to sleep on 3 pillows due to chest discomfort. My chest still feels very uncomfortable. Abdominal breathing is helping to an extent. I have had to stay in bed and greatly reduce my activities since receiving the vaccine.  Today is one week, and I am still in bed.

Around 12:30 am (March 30th) (about 6 hours after receiving the Johnson and Johnson COVID) vaccine I woke up with chills, body aches all over and a headache. That along with fatigue continued for about 28 hours. I missed a day of work due to not feeling well. The following day (March 31st) I still felt tired and spacey. My headache was better. But I started having hot flashes and more minor body aches. Not as severe body aches as the previous day. April 1st I felt back to normal. I called my doctor&#39;s nurse on March 30th to ask if I could take Tylenol to help with my bad headache. She advised not to so I didn&#39;t take any Tylenol or Ibprophen.

                                                Around 6 hours after vaccine, I had uncontrollable chills. This led to a low grade fever. I tried to sleep it off, but woke up with my heart racing- My resting BPM was around 120. My skin was super sensitive. I started taking 2 extra strength Tylenol every 6 hours around 5pm, and that helped a little. I couldn&#39;t focus on anything- I could basically stare at the wall while my heart was hammering. I finally slept, and woke up soaked in sweat with my fever broken (my fever never got above 99) around 2am, and improved steadily after that.

In areas where she scratched, she reports  the rash was dark red with a bit of orange tint.  Reports legs had rash that appeared has hives. Patient also reports that about 1-2 hours post vaccination, she started having chest tightness and shortness of breath. At 1600 she called the clinic and spoke with a medic on the phone.

My body was feeling heavier. I tried to sleep again and was waking up every 1 hour. In the morning, I was feeling like a truck went over me: headache, feeling tired and body pain. I was monitoring the  fever and it went away at around 6am. But I was feeling very tired the entire day and headache stopped at around 3pm. in the night, symptoms were mild. Next day (today) I&#39;m feeling better than yesterday (back to work), but not 100% - would say 80%.

                                                My vaccine was administered at 12:30pm. I waited until 12:55 at CVS after the vaccine to make sure there were no reactions. I also move my arm around a lot after the injection to keep it from hurting. I drove home, at lunch and about 2:45 was hit with a very noticeable headache. I never get headaches and eat healthy and consume about a gallon of water a day. I knew it wasn&#39;t from dehydration or being hungry.  Headache was in the temple area and made my eyes hurt in the same way they would if you had cried for an extended period of time or were overtired. At 3pm a wave of exhaustion hit me. I was sitting working trying to combat the headache and felt almost wiped out. I got through the rest of my work day (4:30) and went to lay down immediately. I passed out almost instantly until 7 pm. I work up and showered, ate dinner and started to feel a little warm. It should be noted it was an unseasonably warm day and got up to 77, so it was a tiny bit warm in my home. I put on loose fitting clothes and slayed on the couch still with the bad headache and the injection site started to throb so I placed and ice pack on for 20 minutes. I could only stay awake until 8:45 and got in bed. I could not get comfortable for several hours feeling very warm. I tried a fan on high and drinking more water but i felt very warm like how you feel with the flu. I took my temp at 1130pm it was normal. I continued to toss and turn and feel very warm and slightly dizzy, in the sense that I hadn&#39;t been able to sleep and with the headache my body was just exhausted. Around 2 am i woke up for more water and got in the shower because I had sweated so much my sheets were wet and my clothes. I got out of the shower around 10 minutes later, changed and got new sheets and got back in bad. Around 330 I felt very hot again and opened the windows and got another ice pack for my arm which was throbbing again. I finally fell asleep after 3:45am. I got up for work at 6am. I felt slightly foggy, and very hot. But no fever. My temp is normally around 97.4-97.9 and it was 98.4. Still normal but I was running warmer than usual. It took a long time to get ready and despite hot water in the shower I was freezing. i got dress and debated going to work. Got in the car at 6:45 and my drive to work is 30 minutes. 1/2 way into my drive I got very sweaty again and went home to change my clothes because they were too warm. Got to work around 7:20 and still felt warm but they take our temps at the door and min was still okay, no fever. I drank a lot of water and ate, and at 8:30 am all of a sudden the exhaustion was gone and I felt normal. I got home form work at 5:30p and took a 3 hour nap and felt normal again.

Within an hour began to feel like I had taken a sedative (reminded me of how klonopin made me feel when I was taking it for anxiety).  Sedative type feeling lasted for approximately 4 hours.  Headache developed approximately 2 hours after receiving vaccination.  Headache and nausea persisted until bedtime.  Had major issues sleeping and had night sweats all night.  Nausea is gone this morning but headache is still present.  Some mild tenderness at injection site that is still present this morning.

The next morning  15 hours after vaccine my arm started to hurt so badly I could barely move. The nerves in the injected arm running up and down with shooting and  pulsing, lack of feeling in hands and extreme pain through the the arm and shoulder on the injected side.  The pain was extreme for 13 days I lost work time. I saw several doctors who sent me on my way. My arm still hurts right now 24 days since vaccine. The pain is not extreme but the nerves still shoot pain and oils and there is often extreme pain by the end of the day.

                                                I had shot and sat to be observed at 8:30 am.  After about three minutes I felt a wave of adrenaline type feeling wash over me and my heart raced and I felt really out of it/fearful.  I sat for a minute hoping it would pass, and it didn&#39;t so I asked for help.  EMT gave me pulse check and blood pressure, both were very very high (don&#39;t know what) and irregular so they brought ECG.  The ECG was also irregular.  I felt disoriented and had waves of heat/blood racing/pulse racing.  I was taken by ambulance to  Hospital.  Within 2.5 hours I was feeling better, not recovered but not as acute.  They did another ECG, still irregular and did some blood draws which seemed to satisfy the Dr.  that nothing was acute.  Once I had returned to a more normal level they released me.  Tonight at home I still have a bit of a racy clammy feeling but have felt more stable thus far.  It was an awful, scary feeling and it come on in just two or three minutes after shot.

                                                Had a sore arm within hour of shot (got it at 7:30pm). Felt a little yucky before going to bed. I made sure to hydrate significantly before the shot and after. I woke up at 3am with chills and had them for about an hour.  Woke up the next morning at 9am with with medium neck and head pain and feeling a little chilly and out of it. Mild ache in joints and body overall. At 10am I took one ibuprofen, but at 11am (200mg), kept pushing fluids. 11am headache got worse temp 98.7 (slightly high for me, I am usually about 97). Started having some gastrointestinal issues around noon. Felt nausea and sweaty palms loss of appetite. Had a bowel movement (normal in appearance).    That all seemed to pass and I felt better, still tired, for most of the afternoon. Arm was sore to the touch and when moving. I managed to eat a few small meals, kept up hydration, and took a nap late in the day. I woke up at 5pm with headache and body aches all over. No appetite again. Had very little to eat, kept hydrating,    At 7pm my vision got a little blurry and I had a minor vasovagal episode. Center of vision blurred, got chills and sweaty, nausea, and I had to poop  (it was less formed). I rested, cool compress, and raised my feet. It all passed in about 20 minutes. I had major loss of appetite rest of the night (couldn&#39;t eat anything), kept hydrating, and went to bed.  Slept through the night with no incidents.   Woke up at 9am second day and had a small breakfast, though my appetite is still not back. Generally feeling exhausted, but no headache or aches in the body anymore. My arm is still sore. Had some more GI distress (another less formed poop around 11am).   My appetite returned by early afternoon on the 2nd day post-vaccine. Still tired and generally feeling &#34;off,&#34; especially mentally. Had brain fog all afternoon and my ears felt plugged today. Hard to concentrate on a task.

The 4th day, I became nauseous and dry heaving again, sleep until the early evening. By the 5th day I was a little better that I could work from home. Did not feel completely like myself until the following Tuesday.

My vision got blurry, I started feeling nauseous, shivers, cold sweats, body felt shaky, and at first I thought I had been drugged. This &#34;attack&#34; lasted for a couple of minutes. After being able to get home I was in bed until 4 pm the next day. At first I had several hours where I was freezing despite being in bed fully dressed with the heat blasting, the following hours, I was sweating. I had a headache, felt nauseous, and uncomfortable all day Saturday. My reaction to the vaccine was much worse than having Covid-19. Missed work due to the symptoms from getting the vaccone.

I felt clear headed but exhausted for the rest of the day.  My chest has been tight and congested since then. Hard to breath and my voice is rough and raspy. This is ongoing and I still have chest tightness and a raspy voice.  On 4/12/21 I started having horrible joint and muscle aches again throughout my body and felt so tired. Horrible headache and stomach pain, bloating and nausea.

The leg pain started on Friday night.  Saturday woke up with a groggy head and tired. Sunday I had leg pain, headache, and foggy brain.  Saturday into Monday I had night sweats (pouring in sweat) fever, headache, body aches, tired (could not keep my eyes open) I slept all day and could barely move comfortably.  Tuesday I was extremely exhausted, leg pain continuing, headache, and weird feeling.  The swollen arm is back.  Today is Wednesday, almost a week after with leg pain, headache, swollen arm, and weird feeling.

                                                experienced a sudden pain to the forehead. Pain increased from 0-100 very rapidly, I became very nauseated to the point of having projectile vomit. Experienced blackout segments. Took 1 dose of 100mg Sumatriptan at about 930pm and tried to sleep w/the immense pain. Took 2nd dose at about 12am. Pain did not dissipate but fell asleep. When i woke up pain was gone but felt very sore, dizzy and disoriented. Fast forward to April 9th while laughing uncontrollably the right side of my face spasmed/cramped  closing my right eye and contracting my right cheek as if having Bell&#39;s Palsy. I have never experienced this before. Face did not continue to droop but has left a tick/twitch sensation under my right eye.

I also had a headache and fever of 100-102 degrees. I was in bed for three days and I was still very fatigued for a whole week. My hands and legs were swelling off and on. I also had some shortness of breath, coughing and chest pain. I was dizzy and lightheaded. I have been very uncomfortable and unable to sleep. I still have tingling and pain in my feet. I get easily winded and I am still experiencing headaches. It has been almost three weeks. My feet and hands are still swelling and my hands are very red. I am seeing my doctor today for a breathing treatment. Everything seems to be slowly improving but the headaches are still coming and going. I have a weird feeling of bubbles all over.

                                                Had a few cocktails and I blacked out, was highly sensitive to the alcohol. I was throwing up for two hours. I couldn?t move. I couldn?t stop the overwhelming need to vomit. I would try and lay down and was in pain. I ended up telling my partner to call an ambulance after two hours of being in such pain. We were across the street from a hospital so we drove. I was given fluid and blood work was done. I left before receiving the results. I couldn?t stand another minute lying there freezing. The machine that was monitoring me kept beeping quickly. I was able to get home and I slept for 12 hours and woke up feeling achy and was having hot flashes for a few hours.

                                                The first symptom I noticed was extreme brain fog and forgetfulness. Then, 6 days after the vaccine, I started having terrifying episodes of acute dysautonomia and panic attacks that included dissociation. These episodes persisted intermittently for 3 weeks. Between the episodes, I was extremely fatigued, brain dead, and unable to concentrate, with a fine resting tremor and constant heart palpitations. I am finally getting treatment from a chiropractic neurologist for subacute encephalitis that caused the dysautonomia and limbic system derangement. A month later, I am still restricted in my activities and have some remaining symptoms of ANS and brain dysfunction, but I am getting better.

                                                I noticed it felt like a sinus cold coming on along with face, head and minor toothaches to the my left side of my face on the the 8th or 9th. I took Tylenol everyday for my sore arm and the headaches but it did help suppress them so I didn?t think much of it. My throat also started to feel kind of raw or itchy but I didn?t have a cough and I noticed a slight post nasal drip. Ok the 10th in the evening I felt exhausted and my face and sinuses were much worse. I took cold medicine and fell asleep early but had a hard time sleeping. I?m a side sleeper and if I turned on my left side, my ear felt like it was burning and my face would go numb. It also made me very dizzy. I woke up with body aches and light headed. My throat doesn?t hurt but it feels different. Almost numb like nothing and I can?t smell or taste.

I slept a good portion of the day and felt I didn?t have the energy to go about daily chores around the house.  I am now 37 weeks pregnant and due on April 9th.  I was able to return resume normal activities the next day and have not experienced any other side effects since then that have restricted me from performing my daily activities.

Symptoms got a bit better after a minute. After about 7 minutes another epi-pen was administered as symptoms were starting to get worse again.

I experienced strong fatigue over the next couple of days, including sleeping 11 hours on 4/9.   I am still tired today, 4/10.  *Dizziness:  Late in the evening, I was very dizzy for a couple of minutes.  My head felt strange on and off throughout the night. Maybe lightheaded and definitely strange.   *Not able to complete normal daily activities because of:  Nausea, chills and hot spells: These 3 were experienced starting around 11pm.  Each symptom would come and go in waves.   I was miserable and could not sleep for very long.  I took lots of naps the next day.  Also, I was unusually forgetful.  These 3 symptoms (chills, nausea, hot spells), along with the fatigue, were so strong that I was unable to do most of my daily activities on 4/8.   I felt only about 50% functional on 4/9 and I&#39;m mostly OK today.       *Fever: none *Heart rate:  frequently elevated about 20 beats per minute from my baseline

I checked in with her 5 minutes into her wait and she said she was fine. Then she complained she was dizzy. I asked her if she had eaten yet (1230pm) and she said no. I had her sit down and drink some orange juice. She then said she wanted to lay down, so I took her back into the booth and she stretched out over a few chairs and boosted her legs up. She said her hands and arms were getting tingly and she started to panic. I took her phone and dialed her husband who was outside and told him to come in. She asked me to call 911, I did. I applied an ice pack to her forehead neck and shoulder areas and she said she was feeling better. I gave her another juice bottle an verified any meds she was on. She wasnt taking any meds. I called mngt also to take a statement. her husband came in and told her to calm down she was just anxious and didnt eat. When the paramedics finally showed up she was feeling much better. they took her out the the ambulance to check her over. They asked her if she wanted to go to the hospital, and she said no. I will call her later to check in on her.

                                                When I first got the shot I noticed it in my throat. I told the nurses they had me wait 20 minutes before I could leave. I felt dizzy but not dizzy enough to not go home. It felt like it went to my stomach, then my head, and then I could feel it in my joints.  I drove home from the city. Two hours pass, I notice a rash but I didn&#39;t think anything of it due to indoor allergens, springtime plus it went away within an hour.   I started to get chills and fever. I had a lack of sleep due to pain throughout the first night. I was waking up feeling like my head was on fire from my ears to the top of the skull area and in front of my face by my eyes too. My eyes felt like they were going to burst. I layed in bed for 24 hours.   Day two: pain, tiredness, headache, and sensitivity to light for the next few days. Symptoms come and go for days then wean off.   Next, I had issues with anxiety, sleeping, yet being really tired as well coupled with problems sitting still. These are subsiding but still there.  I am still very tired today and a bit anxious on April 13th, 2021. I also notice my typing skills, as well as testing skills, are not as sharp as before the vaccination.

                                                About 25 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I felt numbness and tingling on the right side of my face.  This subsided about an hour later. That was one week ago and I&#39;m feeling a little numbness and tingling again in the same part of my face. I&#39;ve also had some bouts of forgetfulness and confusion.  Starting at roughly 11 pm on the same day as receiving the vaccine, I endured common symptoms of fever, severe chills, and body aches. I felt terrible but I knew these side effects were to be expected. I&#39;d say they were in the range of moderate-severe. The symptoms all subsided the following day around 5 pm.

                                                With prior vaccines and flu shots, I have either had no side effects or mild.  But with the COVID vaccine, I was sicker than sick!  I wasn&#39;t expecting to miss as much work as I did, nor go to the doctor three times in a week&#39;s time.  I received it around 11:30am on Thursday, March 18.  Around 1pm, my mild headache started to intensify and had ringing in my ears that would repeatedly come and go (still is doing so today, just not as frequent).  Around 4pm is when all of the &#34;normal&#34; side effects started?chills, hot flashes, sore arm, and super sleepy.  I woke up a couple hours later, with a headache that was WAY worse and was super nauseous.   This was close to 10pm.  Then, around 11pm that same night, I developed HORRID shooting ear pains and took my first Tylenol.  The ear/jaw pain was more than I could stand - had it in both ears, but the right ear was more intense.  It felt like I had a lighting rod between both ears and had these intense &#34;zings&#34; that kept going back and forth, like they were playing ping-pong.  The painful &#34;zings&#34; reminded me of those felt during an ear infection but WAY MORE INTENSE.  My jaw was super tight, as well, with a horribly intense headache.  I spent the entire night night doing warm compresses on my ears, taking Tylenol every 4-6 hours, staying in the shower, and lots of crying.  It was so bad that I felt the need to go to the ER but didn&#39;t feel comfortable driving and didn&#39;t want to go the ambulance route?and thought it was pointless because going to the ER for ear pain would leave me there for hours and hours since I didn&#39;t feel it would be viewed an an urgent emergency.  My goal was to make it through the night and see if I could get into my PCP doctor the following morning.  I took another Tylenol around 5am, and I thankfully cried myself to sleep for a couple of hours.  When I woke up, I called my PCP but couldn&#39;t get in, so I did an online doctor visit through my insurance company.  My fever was about 103.06 at its highest during the night but was gone by 3:34pm Friday afternoon (assuming because I was taking more Tylenol than I had been post-online doctor&#39;s appointment).  Around 7pm Friday evening, I knew I needed to go to the ER or urgent care.  I got a ride and was taken to urgent care for my intense ear pain.  They gave me a Toradol injection and Tramadol prescription.  By bedtime Friday night, the injection was doing its job and made the ear pain and zings were much less intense (didn&#39;t get the prescription until a couple days later).  On March 20, Saturday night, is when I developed a red, itchy rash on my back and tummy.  Over the next couple of days, it was on my chest, arms, legs?pretty much come and was in various places.  I called my PCP Monday morning (March 22), left a message, and they called me back to tell me to restart taking my Zyrtec/HCL to see if it would help the itching.  It has and am just mildly breaking out at this time.  The stinkin&#39; ear/jaw pain returned on Tuesday the 23rd, so I loaded up on OTC ear drops and made an appointment with my PCP for Wednesday, March 24.  She saw no ear infection and essentially told me to keep taking the pain meds.  I received the vaccine on March 18 and did not return to work until the following Thursday.  In retrospect, I should have just missed the remainder of that week, too.

                                                P/C from patient. States she took the vaccine on 4/1/21 @ 1:30 PM. When she heard of the issues that were in the news about the vaccine she thought she should call.  4/1/21 Thursday: That evening around 6 PM she started to have a rash. It started on her L arm where she got her vaccination traveled up her neck, covered her face and trunk. It started out as an itchy red rash but became raised hives. It resolved on it&#39;s own and on Saturday she did not have the rash anymore. Never had any difficulty with breathing. Her left arm where she received her vaccination still has some discoloration. States on Thursday evening she started having a &#34;brain fog&#34;.   4/2/21 Friday: The next morning she woke up and was unable to finish a sentence, states she was confused, &#34;felt like I was on pain medication, like I was drugged&#34;. States she was confused, could not think and could not remember anything. Cried all day over nothing. Would tell her daughter something and then immediately ask what did I just say as she couldn&#39;t remember what she said. She was working on the graduation hooding ceremony and scribbled all over her papers like a 3 year old and the papers were strewn all over the floor. She reports that she had a mild headache all over her head dull pain and pressure 4/10. Took tylenol but that didn&#39;t help at all. Denies having any visual problems, trouble breathing or chest pain. Did have some abdominal dull cramping with nausea and even though it felt like she was going to have diarrhea there was no diarrhea or vomiting . The abdominal pain went away after friday but the nausea stayed through Sunday.She states she got lightheaded if she stood up too fast or turned her head too fast. This just happened on Friday. Denies having any weakness, lack of coordination, or speech issues. She states she was crying and could not stop all day on Friday. She told her boss she was having a mental breakdown and had to go home.  4/3/21 Saturday: Patient states she felt stupid, could not think, could not remember anything she said. States that the horrible headache came on Saturday. It was so bad she had to lay down in a dark room with a wet washcloth over her eyes. The horrible headache.lasted about 1 hour at a 10/10 level. Took some more tylenol but does not think it helped. Went to sleep and when she woke up the headache was still there at a rete of 4/10. She was still nauseate but the crying had resolved.  4/4/21 Sunday: Again, had a  severe migraine when she woke up. 7/10, not as bad as the one on Saturday. It lasted a couple of hours and then went back to the 4/10 headache that has persisted at the 3-4/10 level the entire time since she got her vaccination. The headache never stops hurting and stays 3-4/10.   4/5/21 Monday: Had a regular headache 3-4/10. Still felt &#34;loopy&#34; and with brain fog.  Went to work on Monday and told her boss about it and that she still says she can&#39;t think straight. Her boss has been very supportive and has helped her to complete her assignments to get them in on time.   4/6/21 Tuesday: Still had a  headache, It has been continuous ever since Friday. Still taking Tylenol and it doesn&#39;t seem to help. Yesterday she even tried Ibuprofen and it didn&#39;t help.   4/13/21 Today is day 13 and she still can&#39;t think straight. still has 3-4/10 headache, still all over her head. Feels that she still has brain fog, but not as &#34;loopy&#34;. Feels like she can remember what she has said better.   She called the nurse line at her husband&#39;s work.They told her that it was just a reaction to the vaccine. The patient didn&#39;t think to report it to the Health Center.  She got the vaccine from the Health Center (she asked if employees could get the vaccine and said she would prefer that)  She is not pregnant.  She has no chronic health conditions and takes no medications routinely  She denies being allergic to any medications and states she has taken the Flu shot without any reaction in the past.  NOTE: Tested positive for COVID on 2/4/21 and was told it was OK to get the vaccine. She lost her taste and smell and said she felt she had a mild flu for a couple of days. Has regained her sense of taste and smell and has had no residual symptoms.   Instructed patient to go to the ER for an exam. She needs a full neuro exam and at least a C_T scan of the head. She would like to contact her Primary Care Provider. States she hasn&#39;t seen him for a couple of years but feels like he would want to know. Instructed patient to call me with the outcome of her visit to her PCP or the ER. Patient verbalized understanding of and agreement with plan.

Pharmacist was asking if the patient is okay and the patient stopped responding so the pharmacist kneeled over to pick up the patients head and she looked flushed, her eyes were bulging and she began to sweat. The pharmacist asked the technician to call 911, asked the patient if she could breathe and the patient said yes but said she is not feeling well. She kneeled back over and the pharmacist was holding her hand telling her to continue breathing. The patient was very sweaty continued to breathe heavily. About two minutes passed and the patient was expressing she was feeling better and better as the pharmacist was speaking to her. The EMTs arrived 7 minutes after the call the patient had sat up already and was speaking and feeling alert.  She expressed that she felt like she was underwater and the pharmacists voice was fading during the minutes after the shot and she felt like her heart was racing. She explained that she suffers from anxiety.  The EMTs took her blood pressure when the patient was sitting and standing up, blood pressure was in normal range and also checked her blood glucose with a finger stick which was also in normal range. The patient had mentioned previously that she biked to the pharmacy. Later on the pharmacist called to check on the patient she said that she is feeling well and biked back home.

Everything but the soreness of the injection site and tightness in the muscles on that side lasted about 48  hours. The tight muscles and soreness lasted about a week.  *** THREE WEEKS AFTER THE SHOT**** Sunday, 4/12/2021 I woke up and stepped out of bed and my left ankle gave out when I stepped down. Internal rotation, weakness in left ankle. It happened again as I walked shortly after. That day I tripped many times due to weakness in that ankle. When I showered and shaved my legs I realized that I had absolutely no feeling in the left lateral part of my lower leg. It felt like I had a novocaine injection in my leg. I could not even feel a pin prick there. By Friday 4/9/2021 I started to have some sensation, but still decreased sensation and weakness in my left ankle even at this moment.  ****4 WEEKS AFTER THE SHOT**** My period started Monday, April 5th, 2 days early. By Friday, 4/9/2021 and through the day and night Saturday 4/10/2021, I had such a heavy period that I kept soaking through tampons, pads, and 2 pairs of jeans. I have never blead like that and could not keep up.

Woke up the a few hours later and went to work and headache came back so I kept taking Motrin until I got off. When I got home I was tired and my headache came back so I went to lay down because I was cold as well. I went to bed and woke up really cold and my husband came in to check on me and I was running a fever of 101.5. My body was hurting really bad as well I took another Motrin and went back to sleep. I woke up the next morning a little weak with a fever blister. I was still sore and has a headache as well. I took some more Motrin all day and the pain went away. I didn?t report to any doctor because I thought this may be normal.

                                                About 9 pm I felt fatigue, I went to bed. I took 800 mg of ibuprofen and 1000 mg Tylenol as a pain medication. I drank a bunch of water and took an Emergen-C. I fell asleep by 10:00. I slept and I woke up - shocked awake around 04:30 am - I was super thirsty. My whole body was really sore and stiff and I had a headache.  It was uncomfortable but not unmanageable. I decided to take more Tylenol and Ibuprofen and drink more water again. I got back in bed and was feeling a lot of symptoms - I was really sore in my thigh muscles, lower back, knees and forearms. I had slight chills; I was pretty uncomfortable. I couldn&#39;t get back to sleep - I couldn&#39;t sleep on my arm with the injection site. This was about 5 pm. I never actually had a fever. But just a lot of fatigue and body aches. For the next day or two - I took 800 mg of ibuprofen and 1000 mg Tylenol every 6 hours. Within 48 hours, the body aches started to subside. I still felt a bit fatigued and I still do feel fatigued to this day. Into the next week, I started feeling like (towards the middle of the week - about the 7th) I was having an urinary urgency feeling. It was a sensation in my lower back like a UTI was coming on. I haven&#39;t gotten one in a long time ( I use to). On Friday or Saturday, when I wiped, I was seeing a slight pinkish hue  - a trace of blood - in my urine. Decided to take probiotics and Vit C. and I started to feel better. But Sunday morning, I was back to feeling pretty bad. I visited the Urgent Care on Sunday, the 11th. In the visit, they took a urine specimen. Dr. saw blood in my urine from the test. And an absence of nitrates in the urine and she said it wasn&#39;t  a typical UTI. They decided to culture the urine specimen. Macrobid - 2 times a day for 7 days - antibiotics was prescribed. I felt a little better the second day of taking it, I thought, but it was up and down. Culture showed there was no UTI.  Friday, the 16th, I had my annual visit with my PCP, I was feeling okay by this time. But I still had a sensation in my lower back - not a pain but a sensation and I still feel this sensation now (on my left side). She asked me to come back after the antibiotics to take another urine sample. Lab test. I feel some fatigue but I&#39;m doing normal daily life.

                                                immediately after the injection the injection site was sore. The injection site still remains sore 3.5 days later. Approximately 7 hours after the injection (6:45pm), physical exhaustion set in; mental state was wide awake (thinking about everything/mind racing), however. Approximately 1 hour after the exhaustion began, slight fever and chills started.  By 9 pm the fever and chills increased to the point of teeth chattering and touch to the body felt raw.  Throughout the night, the fever and chills continued.  Sleep was mixed with pain in the legs and restlessness, coupled with a mild headache.  In the morning, the headache increased, but the chills subsided and the fever had broken (8am); slight nausea.  Eating food seemed to keep the nausea at bay; body exhaustion still existed.  headache subsided by the evening. no further chills/fever symptoms.  1.5 days for major adverse symptoms.  Soreness at injection is still continuing (no discoloration or lump, just soreness).  no vomiting, diarrhea, migraine  perhaps related, but not sure...my right leg had a broken fibula a month prior, but was ~98% healed.  The evening of the injection, that ankle was swollen to the size when the injury first occurred.  Earlier that day, the ankle had no visible signs of injury (no swelling, discoloration, etc).  In the morning, the ankle appeared as it had the day/week before.

I took some Tylenol which brought the fever down for a few hours but it later shot back up to 104. I had a headache, muscle pain, and fatigue. On Monday, I got a sharp pain on the side of my head causing my eyes to hurt. I called doctor who said that it sounded like a sinus infection and prescribed me Azithromycin. Days later the doctor called me and I told him that I wasn&#39;t feeling better and was referred to take a Doppler test which showed nothing wrong. I went to another doctor that prescribed me Bactrim which cleared up my sinus infection and I felt a little better. I still feel fatigued, have brain fog, and double vision. I went to a neurologist and was given a CT scan. That was two weeks ago and I never heard about the results. I&#39;m scared to drive because I don&#39;t know what will happen. The vaccine also threw off my cycle and I have gained so much weight since my vaccination.

                                                3pm: Immediate body-wide, internal feeling that can only be described as &#34;intoxication.&#34; Felt loopy &amp; woozy -- not lightheaded or dizzy. Felt as if I were floating to chair. Sat for 20mins, legs weak, odd sensation across shoulder blades &amp; cervical spine. &#34;Slow&#34; &amp; woozy for duration of evening. Physically moved slow, cognitively slowed down, inability to focus. Internal body-wide sensation difficult to define. All very similar to immediate effects I have from alcohol. Passed out (sleep) 9hrs later &amp; woke 100% fine at 8am.

                                                About 7 hours after the vaccine injection I started to feel flu-like symptoms: aches, chills, woozy and slightly nauseous. Within the next few hours the symptoms became increasingly worse, but not different other than the addition of a headache. I took 2 Tylenol to help with the headache and fever. Overnight sleep was difficult due to chills, sweats, fever dreams and aches. The symptoms lessened the next day (24-hours post injection), but still included muscle/body aches, headache, and extreme fatigue. Again took 2 Tylenol to help. Today (48-hours post injection) I&#39;m feeling quite a bit better although still not 100%. Soreness at injection site persists, especially when lifting my arm.

I have a herniated disc in my lower back and this was severely aggravated by the vaccine. My back and fingers hurt so bad I couldn?t sleep at all. Tried not to take Tylenol finally took some after 3-4 hours and it helped a lot with fever and joint pain. Also had a headache. Fever and pain was gone after 8 hours. Then felt very low energy with a headache all the second day. Third day I felt great except are sore.

                                                Day of vaccine, I felt like my lymph nodes were swollen. Two days later the injection site started to get deep red. Friday I started to about an inch of so, swell up some. Saturday I had a rash on my arm by the injection site, the top part on my bicep was pretty red and swollen. I didn&#39;t take my Humara or Zolar injection. On Sunday the rash got worse and grew in size and really hot to touch, the pain was radiating all the way to my wrist and hurt really bad causing pain when I moved my wrist. It was hard for me to go to sleep so I called the dr and went in . The dr. said it looked less red that what it was and told me to take Ibuprofen 800mg* 3x day.  The pain is now in both wrist and hard for to grip stuff and a little hot to touch.  You can see the difference in the skin tone where the rash was, it looks bruised.

                                                I received my shot at 9:15AM at 11.5 hours later I began feeling foggy, fatigue and flu like symptoms. I had a slight fever and just stayed in bed the day after. Ibuprofen seemed to help the headaches but not the body aches. No nausea. Within 72 hours I was almost back to my normal self, but still extremely tired, and my neck and back hurt quite a bit. Today marks 13 days. As of 5 days ago I began to get cold like symptoms. Neck and back still extremely uncomfortable, neck barely able to move side to side. I have a bit of a cough with phlegm. Headaches are still happening quite a bit, and still super tired all the time. I feel like I?ve been sick ever since I took the shot, and have to take several days off work.

Continued nocturnally for 4-5 nights before beginning during daytime hours encompassing both legs &amp; both feet. Spread to left arm on day 5 &amp; then to include right arm a day later. Weakness in all limb muscles. Difficulty walking. Unable to carry heavier items, unable to lift over 5lbs with both arms, unable to move arm from plate to mouth at its worst. All symptoms waxed &amp; waned, Guillian Barre was ruled out due to this. Currently 20 days post vaccine with little relief. Medical care has been sought &amp; is continuing at this time.

I woke up at about 05:00 am with a fever of 101.6. My heart rate was elevated - racing heart. I took some more Tylenol -and I tried to sleep but it was hard to. After a few hours, I felt achy and sore but better. Three days later, had a run of skipped heart beats (Thursday) and heart palpitations. I called my regular doctor on Monday and on Thursday, I called the Cardiologist. I take a beta blocker when I have bad heart palpitations and they continued to happen but were better with the beta blocker. Within a few hours, on Thursday, the symptoms resolved. I still have heart palpitations but the vaccine may have increased them.

Wouldn&#39;t go away, checked heart rate on pulse ox. Read 130. Went to Er to be checked out to be safe. They did a cardiac work up, chest xray, checked urine &amp; gave me IV fluids. Heart rate was in the 120&#39;s at the hospital &amp; came down to the 90&#39;s after awhile. Didn&#39;t feel the racing anymore. Was released from hospital. After about 3 hours, heart rate was back in the 70&#39;s. Haven&#39;t felt any racing since. Did a follow up with PCP a couple weeks later. No issues since.

                                                Thursday 04/08/21 - 1:35 PM Went to Fairgrounds to get the Johnson &amp; Johnson - Janssen COVID-19 vaccine shot with my husband. Both of us wore our masks, walked in together, went through the line together, we both got the shot in our left arms and then set together and waited the 15 minutes before we could leave. A little later at home we were working on some landscape lighting and I felt a bit foggy, light headed and kind of out of it. I was drilling into masonry and the first hole went fine but the second one for some reason just wasn?t going and I touched the drill bit with my fingertip on my left hand to see if it had smoothed out and I knew in my head not to do it and that it should be hot as heck but I didn?t feel anything at all so later that evening when I took a shower my finger was burning and I knew I had burnt it. That evening I begin to feel crippling cold, my fingernail and toenail beds had turned purple and I was shivering violently. I got under a pile of blankets with my dog and  tried to slow my breathing I could feel my heart beating in my chest and it felt like the air I was breathing was cold and frosty. I had a 104&#43; fever that night. My husband got me some aspirin a cold washcloth for my head a popsicle and water to help bring down the fever. And I was able to sleep on and off that night. When I woke up I had a 103&#43; fever and a tingling and numbness in my arms. Before the fever my arms felt tight and cold and I had a tingle that ran from my elbows to my fingertips. Again it was aspirin cold washcloth and lots of water to drink to try and get my fever down.   Friday 04/09/21 Was spent in bed trying to drink water and sleep through it. My arm was sore, not at the injection site but the whole top part of my arm felt like I had been hit by a truck. I had a fever again that evening.   Saturday 04/10/21 I thankfully woke up fever free but my arms were tingling. I had to take my husband to the airport that morning at 6:30 AM. I came back home and went back to bed until about nine when I woke up my arms were cold and sore and tingling it seemed to be getting worse in my left arm and I felt shots of electricity from my elbow down to my fingertips. At one point I took a picture because my left arm hurt so much more than the right and my fingertip beds were purple on my left and pink on my right. I took aspirin and took a nap. I couldn?t hold my phone with both hands hands like normal sitting in bed because my left hand goes cold and achy. Woke up worried that both my arms were aching and tingling from my elbows to my fingertips seems to be where it stays the most. Then that pain subsided and my lip started to tingle. After a few hours that stopped but the tingling in my arms is about constant not as strong sometimes, not in both arms sometimes, it seems to almost always be in my left arm and at one point scary enough that I almost went to the ER. Went to bed around 11:30 PM and the tips of the toes on my left side were tingling and it went to the whole leg.  Sunday 04/12/21 I woke up with a coughing fit  and mucus at around 1:00AM and my right leg with a little tingly at 4:24 AM awake again and coughing woke me had to get a drink and my stomach was buzzing and stopped now just back to the bottom half of my left leg. All of a sudden after a coughing and sneezing fit I got a tremendously sore burning throat out of no where that only lasted about five minutes. I noticed my left arm straining to hold up the pizza box tonight when my right arm had no trouble at all. Then a little later in the day stiffness in the back of my neck. It is a weird strong dry cough and I was scared to go to the ER because my symptoms were so varied and ever-changing I didn?t know what they would do with me and I didn?t want to just get stuck in there for days with him not knowing or making it worse. I told my husband ? It?s so random I?m a little scared no one is going to know what to do with me...?I?ve had issues with allergic reactions and no one being able to diagnose them and me having to figure it out on my own on the Internet that I had Thyroid problems and that I was allergic to the sun for a few years in the past and aloe vera... I didn?t wanna wind up going, them not fixing anything and having a huge bill to pay. But this whole time my body is buzzing and tingling and going through something strange. At this point I am just telling my family I?m okay and what random symptoms I have had since we spoke last. They are on standby to watch my children if I need to go to the ER. The constant buzzing, numbness, cold tingling in my arms is worrisome.   Monday 04/12/21 I am use to the numbness and tingling being a constant thing on some part of my body... There are times when I feel fine but I know it won?t last long. We can add an upset stomach and diarrhea to the list. I had a metal taste in my mouth for a little bit today. Both arms legs and my lips have randomly buzzed, ached or tingled. The websites say call 911 for emergency or call your local medical provider for assistance so I called the local ER to see if they could tell me if my symptoms were normal or if it?s something I should come in for and they couldn?t give me any advice... I was told if you feel like you should come in then come in. I had a very strong sharp pain at my elbow of my right arm tonight that made me sit up in bed...   Tuesday 4/13/21 My left arm is still sore if people touch me or if I try to sleep on my side like I normally do it hurts trying to hold my phone with both hands my arm still goes cold and achy. So far this morning my arms are both tingling and my left leg and my lips so at this point I just say I?m buzzy. 11:25 AM randomly my right arm decided to feel worse for a change but is back to a low buzz... after a few minutes. I find myself holding them up or lifting them when they hurt it seems to help a little to elevate my arms to my chest. I am just waiting to see what comes out in the media, or to see if this gets any better, or if they learn what to do about it... It isnt over, it hasnt stopped yet.

The rooms were full so I  was in wheelchair waiting for room, shaking profusely, blue fingers, nauseous, dizzy and couldn&#39;t stand on my own. I was able to go to restroom w/assistance but My muscles were stiffened for 1 hour&#43; and over and i felt awful. over the course of 5 hours I gained strength back and started to feel better with just mild headache and nausea.   They did EKG, blood panel and chest xray which looked ok. Diagnoses as allergic reaction and told me to come back if more issues.

Arm started to be really sore and a tight swollen bump at injection site. Severe nausea and dizziness immediately following by 10 am and extremely tired. Now almost 9 days later the lump at injection site is still there and sore. I find this very concerning and uncomfortable.  The nausea lasted about 12 hours. The tiredness and dizziness lasted about 7 days. The bad pounding headache lasted all day followed by mild headaches throughout the week.

Seven days after the vaccine I began having dizzy spells, extreme fatigue and nausea, blurred vision, extreme right head pressure, floaty sensation, numbness and tingling in my right arm and leg, muscle spasms, and extreme anxiety. All things I have never experienced before. And they have persisted daily since they began. My first period one week after the injection was a couple days late and very light and only lasted a few days, which is also not normal roe me. I have short periods of relief and then the symptoms return. It is very scary and I need help. I have been to my pcp several times and the Er. They can?t explain my symptoms.

From about 7:00 pm to about midnight, I felt awful.  I couldn&#39;t walk down a short hall without assistance.  I was so sore and achy I couldn&#39;t really sleep.  I felt insanely hot, yet had chills and I had a terrible headache.  I am type 1 diabetic, and my blood sugar spiked to over 200, where it hovered between 200 &amp; 300 most of the night, despite the fact that I used insulin to try and lower it.  From 10 pm to midnight, I felt nauseous.  Overnight was ok.  I still had some of those symptoms, but could sleep off and on.  I probably woke up every couple of hours.  I was till very sore and hot, but not as hot, and still had a headache.  Today, I took Tylenol this morning.  I still have a mild headache, sore body, tired and a little slow, but significantly better than last night.

About 2 hours later the chills were alternating with fever and I could barely stand because I felt so weak from the muscle aches. I was in so much physical pain I didn&#39;t sleep at all that night. The fever lasted until late afternoon the next day (about 24 hrs total), and the body aches lasted until late afternoon the day after that (about 48 hrs total).

After a few hours, the upper legs became red and itchy. It then affected my right arm, a little on my abdomen, and then the right elbow area. Benadryl, a cold shower, and icing the areas made the symptoms go away for several hours, but they returned over night at 3am.  Day 8, the symptoms were gone most of the day, but returned in the evening around 8pm. Benadryl taken and iced down the arms and legs.  Symptoms subsided.  They returned again at 3am and woke me from sleeping. It affected both feet, both legs, both arms, a little on my back and sides.

                                                Severe burning sensation when injected. Extremely sore arm once injection removed. Directed to park car for to be monitored for 15 minutes. Parked the car. Car was in park but still running. Attendant at the clinic instructed me to move my car forward. I put the car in ?Drive? and as I moved forward I lost consciousness. Completely blacked out. Foot released off brake and unconscious in the car, the car rolled for some distance and crashed in a parked car. I was revived once someone tried to wake me up. I was white and delirious and had no idea what had happened.  Presently have no smell and have been very tired with the chills. I was sweating in my sleep, shivering and woke up in a wet bed from all my sweat. The next day my arm is extremely sore and I am running low grade fever. If the car attendant did not tell me to move my car I would have blacked out in a stationary car and not cause damage to someone else?s car. This has caused nearly $7000 in damages to my car not to mention the other car.

                                                Approximately 13 hours after receiving the vaccine, I woke up in the night with nausea, chills, fever, spinal pain, joint and bone pain, and the worst headache of my life that I could feel in my brain stem and spinal cord. I also experienced confusion and difficulty walking to the bathroom. The headache was not relieved by OTC pain relievers. I had difficulty sleeping and felt restless. I felt the fever ?break? around 5am with profuse sweating. I had to miss work today (I am a nurse myself who was actually working at the clinic when I received my vaccine). It is now 3pm and after taking a sleep aid and sleeping all day, I do feel better, but the headache remains. I had H1N1 about 10 years ago and aside from that, this is probably the sickest I?ve ever been and it is, with certainty, due to the Covid vaccine.

                                                Within 5 minutes of shot I was nauseous on scale of 1-5 1 being hardly and 5 being Extremely I was 4. This remained at a 4 for over 36 hours. By 930 pm approximately 12 hours after shot I was running a Very high fever and had EXTREME chills, body aches, latharic and my arm hurt bad. There was no discoloration or swelling in the arm however. I expected these side effects but they were so much worse then expected or discribed. My husband had same effects. We are both very healthy and active young adults. This felt like a SEVERE 24 hour flu. Not, &#34;flu-like&#34;. I would be very afraid of we had ANY underlying health conditions. Also my heart had a cramping burning pain that came and went. No fluttering, it felt like the muscle was contracting around my heart or the actual heart was contracting and staying contracted for about 5 minutes at a time. This occured only to me and happened about 3-4 times withing the first 24 hours with the first experience while I was at the pharmacy being monitored for the 15 minute post shot. I have no known underlying heart issues and have never been diagnosed with any heart problems or been seen for any such issue. But it was real and it was scary.   I took 1, 500mg tylenol at 930pm the day of the shot for the fever and aches.  I took 1, 500mg tylenol at 9am the fallowing morning, as I was still experiencing aches and a low fever. It has been 48hours and I am still feeling lathargic. But more as expected.

I was dizzy, but almost more feeling like my thoughts were jumbled and I had a hard time speaking. I began to get a terrible headache and then began vomiting. I was shaking and out of breath. I was terrified because this was something I had never felt before. The symptoms began to fade within 4 hours and then I experienced the &#34;normal&#34; side effects, such as arm pain and tiredness.

Ended up leaving work a little over 2 hours after I started.  I was feeling nausea, achy, chills, fatigue, dizziness/lightheaded, sore arm.  Went home and to bed.  Still fatigued, sore arm and a little achy the next day.  Now on day 4 since vaccine and am still experiencing a sore arm &amp; fatigue(improving but not back to my normal energy level).  On a positive note my ongoing sinus symptoms(since June 2020) have improved.  They are not gone but noticeably improved.  I&#39;m thankful for that and hoping it lasts!!!!

                                                About 7 hours after the shot (around 9pm) nausea began. Then violent shaking chills. Then a severe migraine. There was NO fever. Was unable to sleep. This kept me up all night. By the early morning, the chills and nausea had subsided, but the migraine continued for several more hours.

I had to set a reminder to eat otherwise I would go hours without food and never once would I feel hungry.    Other events - odd headache that lasted about 24 hours, pain when touching face lasted about 12 hours, &amp; back, neck, shoulder and upper arms all painful like I had been at the gym for three days straight - lasted about 24 hours. Brain fog that lasted about 5 to 6 days. Dizzy spells for about 5 days.

After 30 minutes I felt okay to leave the pharmacy.  Felt lightheaded the rest of the day and really out of it. Developed a fever later that evening that ran throughout the night.  Loss of appetite for 3-4 days.  Diarrhea on day 4.  Pain in arm at injection site for 4 days.

All syptoms lasted approximately 24 hours, causing missed work. (Used Tylenol to help with fever and pain)  The second day, fever, body aches, chills/sweats subsided but extreme fatigue and arm pain lingered for the next 3-4 days.

That went into pressure in my head, my tongue got numb and started to swell, started coughing up blood. I took prednisone and used my epipen. When I got home I was terrified to go to the hospital. The oral swelling subsided. The head pressure lasted at least 12 hours. My bp was real low (70/45). It did slowly come back up. Cough and chest congestion is still present. Brain fog. Fever lasted about 4 days.  This is the second report I?m putting in. I did not hear back on the last one submitted 4/8

There was an immediate suspicion that I may have blood clotting even being on Eliquis or bleeding in my brain. A brain cat scan and other tests were performed. I was discharged from the hospital the same day.  I am past a monthly the Janssen vaccine now and still have left leg cramps and headaches. My body feels weak and is restless.

                                                Lightheadedness and exhaustion set in 15-25 minutes post injection. Later that same evening, experienced nausea, muscle, bone, and joint aches as well as chest pain that were much reduced by the following morning. Malaise continued as did symptoms of nausea without vomiting.  24 hours post injection, experienced a low grade fever of 99.6 F (for me, this is a low grade temp). Fever broke after another 24 hours.  Experienced severe headaches in the middle of the forehead for 8-12 hours on 3/25/2021, 3/29/2021, 4/3/2021.  Experienced difficulty breathing 3/30/2021. Woke up from deep sleep feeling starved for oxygen and a sensation that a deep enough breath could not be taken--the lungs could  not expand enough. Respiratory rate seemed slightly depressed. It passed after about 30 minutes with focused effort on taking deep, regular breaths. Fell asleep again and did not consult a medical provider about it. The oxygen hunger / breathing issue did not repeat.  Medical professionals were not consulted for any of the episodes described above.

As the day went on, started feeling more soreness and headache. By 7 pm that night, I was extremely fatigued and nauseated. Pain very bad in my arm that night to where I could not sleep. Each day that has gone on, I have had worsening fatigue, headaches, and an increase in my heart rate, and a decrease in my blood pressure. I&#39;ve had an increase in brain fog and an increase in sleep issues. The pain in my arm went away after 4 or 5 days.

                                                Received the J&amp;J Covid Vaccine shoot on Sunday, April 11th at the  Clinic. The night of receiving my shot, I had a migraine and neck pain which resulted in trouble sleeping.  When I got up in the morning, I started having severe muscle pain in my thighs and in my calf, mild cramps in the abdomen.  The leg pain lasted the entire day with exhaustion, which interfered with my ability to work a full day.  When I went to bed later that night, I still had pain behind my left knee and I was worried about if there was a blood clot.  I got up the next morning and my legs were still cramping but improved from the prior day.  When I saw the news discussing the blood clot issue associated with the J&amp;J vaccine, I felt it was important to contact my Dr. to discuss the leg pain.  They did an ultrasound (vascular scan) on my left leg and follow up with my doctor&#39;s office walk-in clinic after the scan.  My legs were examined and no clots were identified.  We discussed things to watch for.

The night was miserable with fever, chills and dizziness when walking to the bathroom.  The next day low grade fever and chills that began to subside around 24 hours post vaccination.  For the next 48 hours had residual aches and fatigue.  Began feeling significantly better after the 72 hour mark.  However, after learning about blood clot issue has been having anxiety and some left sided pain that I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s anxiety or migraine related or possibly something worse.

                                                Patient reports: &#34;I received my covid 19 vaccine on Friday April 9th (J&amp;J) and need to report my reactions afterward. Had the usual immediate arm pain after injection along with nausea. Took a Benadryl and napped when got home and woke up 6 hours after injection with a tingling and swollen lower lip and constricted breathing. Took 3 Benadryl in fear of going to hospital and waited it out. Once lip went back to normal as well as breathing went to bed since it was late and slept all day Saturday. Woke up Sunday in agony from lower back pain and tailbone. Now, thurs 4/15 still in extreme pain in my tailbone. Went twice to chiropractor to help and nothing is alleviating the pain and have been practically bed ridden since Sunday. Can?t work, can?t sit, can?t walk can?t stand can?t anything without extreme pain. Been taking ibuprofen everyday and not helping.&#34;   She had a visit with us on 4/15/2021: &#34;Patient here for extreme pain on her tailbone. She had the Johnson and Johnson vaccine about 6 days ago and about 6 hours later she woke up with a tingling and swollen lip, constricted breathing, and dizziness. She wanted to avoid the hospital, so she took benadryl 75 mg and it slowly resolved her symptoms. These symptoms have not returned since. She was finally able to fall asleep that night and then slept all day the next day. The following day she woke up and experienced extreme pain in her lower back and tailbone. She saw her chiropractor twice this past week, which helped to resolve her low back pain. Per patient her chiropractor noted that her back seemed very inflamed. However, she is still having extreme pain with her tailbone and is unable to sit, stand, bend or work for more than 20 minutes without extreme pain. The only thing that seems to improve her pain is laying on her back with several pillows tucked behind and all around her. However, she is only able to stay in this position for a period of time before her body becomes stiff from immobility. She has been taking ibuprofen 600 mg TID, flexeril PRN, icing and applying moist heat to her back, but none of these measures seem to improve her pain. Lastly she has noticed that when she sits/stands for too long, her buttocks start to spasm. Denies fever, chills, n/v, numbness, tingling, incontinence or loss of bowel/bladder function.&#34;

The next day when I tried to work I couldn&#39;t go down the stairs because my legs where hurting a lot. I also had a huge headache I couldn&#39;t eat I felt very nauseas. My worst symptoms were my headaches it was a sever headache. On 4/12/2021 &amp; 4/13/2021 I had diarrhea. On 04/1 4/2021 I went to the ER they did blood work they did a heart exam everything came out good and they just said it was just a reaction to the vaccine. I kept drinking Tylenol for my headache. On 4/17/2021 is when I did not feel the headache anymore. Now I just feel very fatigue.

I checked my temperature, but it was in the normal range (98.3 degrees)  I took Tylenol (2 pill), hydrated, ate dinner and slept. I felt ok the next day, just a little strange (hard to pinpoint issue ... but &#34;off&#34;). Took another 2-pill dose of Tylenol just in case.

                                                Ongoing serious fatigue often accompanied by weakness and dizziness  Almost every single day over the past month I have felt awful and struggle to complete my daily responsibilities. I was an extremely healthy, athletic individual 5&#39;4&#34; 114&#34; and haven&#39;t had any other vaccines since 2 travel immunizations 5 years ago. Nothing else about my lifestyle has changed.

The following Friday, April 9th, I had bloodwork done. It felt like I had hit my funny bone. I had shooting pain up my arm and into my neck and down my spine. I thought it was just the blood draw, so I suffered all weekend. My husband made me go to the doctor on Monday. My doctor said I had the same symptoms of a blood clot. They sent me to the hospital for an ultrasound and blood tests recommended, but everything was negative. She told me to just watch out for any changes and it went away after a few days.

                                                The night I started getting feverish. I rested. On Monday, I called out sick. Monday, Tuesday - it was chills, fever. 2nd day, my legs started having a sensation I&#39;ve never ever felt - like cramping/charlie horse. I went to work on the third day but I needed to go home. When I came home, my legs were doubled the size. I tried to ride it out by resting. Ever since then, my legs have weird sensations - not cramps but aches. I have never felt this before. Once in a while, when I&#39;m walking, I get cramps. It still hasn&#39;t gone away. At the end of the day, my legs will be swollen but not as bad as the third day after the vaccine.  I think my platelets are actually too high so I think that is a good thing. Upcoming doctor&#39;s appt on July 9 - she is going to do a whole physical with bloodwork.

Left Arm immediately felt odd---sore, heavy, tingly all the way down to my wrist.  By noon, I was asleep.  Slept for about 3 hours.  Up for 3 hours.  Slept for 3.  Up for 3.  Then slept all night.   I had a headache and slept most of the next day.  Definitely felt like my body was fighting something.     I have an approximately 3 inch diameter circle around injection site that is a red, swollen, hard, lump,  It is hot to the touch and extremely sore---at times it itches.  I am shocked how big and hard the knot is.  Its crazy!  I cannot put weight on that arm.  Extremely sore.  It is now 4 days after the vaccine and the knot does not seem to be getting smaller.  In fact, it may be bigger.

I said I wanted to give her benadryl and patient refused. Sat with patient and she reported no changes, just felt different and tingled a little. Patient stated that it did not feel like allergic reactions she has had in the past. Checked tongue and lips for swelling, no sign of anything like that or other signs of anaphylaxis. By the end of allotted 30 min waiting period, patient said she felt normal again. She stayed in the store for another 30 minutes and reported back that she was fine.

                                                Around 7 pm on 3/13, I developed brain fog, trouble walking, and then fever, severe muscle pain worse in legs, and chills.  Most of these symptoms seemed to improve on 3/14, but then on 3/15, I developed new onset of shortness of breath and chest discomfort.  On 3/16 around 1 pm the shortness of breath worsened and I went to the emergency room.  I felt that I couldn&#39;t take a deep breath in and I had chest discomfort on the left side of my chest worse when taking a deep breath.  My legs were hurting as well, especially my left leg.  I had sinus tachycardia (heart rate 106-120) and increased respiratory rate (rate of 20)  with O2 sats 100% on room air.   My breathing and heart rate improved somewhat with 1 liter oxygen therapy, 1 liter of IV fluids, albuterol inhaler, and decadron 6 mg orally.  It was thought that I had a delayed asthmatic/allergic reaction to the vaccine.  I do not have a history of asthma.  I was prescribed a Medrol dose pack and albuterol inhaler.  My hands and feet are very cold and tingling on 3/18.  Shortness of breath and chest pain seems to have improved but not completely gone as of the time of this submission on 3/18.

It hurts to move the arm different ways. Many times, I have to lay flat to  get relief from the pain. I don&#39;t have alot of strength in my left arm since getting the vaccine. I consulted the school nurse about my effects and she stated it could be an inflamed nerve.

I was sitting on the couch with my legs outstretched and crossed at the ankle in front of me. I thought it was because I had my legs crossed. I uncrossed them. The feeling did not go away. It is now the next day and the feeling is still present. I sit this way often and have never had this happen before. I assume it is due to the vaccine.  It is extremely weird to feel pins and needles constantly in your foot.

Immediately following administration of the vaccine, patient began experiencing the sensation of heart racing, difficulty breathing, and feelings of anxiety.  Patient relates this has happened with vaccines received in the past, as she has postural orthostatic tachycardic syndrome (POTS).  She feels as if this is an aggravation of her POTS.  Patient states she has allergies/sensitivities to ciprofloxacin, bactrim, and sulfa drugs, but she has never needed to use epinephrine.  She denies chest pain/tightness, wheezing, swelling of the face/lips/mouth/tongue/throat, skin rash/itching, cramping abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  She does not take any medications on a daily basis.  POTS aggravation.  Patient was not displaying active signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis.  Patient?s heart rate and breathing continued to slow down once patient was brought to a quiet place and started to enact breathing techniques.  Vital signs continued to improve as patient sat.  Patient encouraged to consult her PCP and inform them of their post-vaccination reaction.  She was instructed to go to the emergency department if she should develop chest pain, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face/lips/airway, cramping abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting.   Patient discharged to home

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA:  Immediately after the vaccination my arm was sore and shortly after my right hand was stiff.  About 8 hours after receiving the vaccination I began to have extreme chills and a fever that was near 102 F.  I had a fever and chills all night and woke up with a migraine.  After sleeping most the day from extreme tiredness I woke up to my head feeling very weird and I was acting very sleepy and irritable according to those around me.  After 24 hours, most  reactions have gone away except for soreness at the injection site and a pain in my right leg.

Reflux symptoms at 4AM which caused me to take 2 OTC Gaviscon which gave relief. At 7AM experienced a fogginess and severe fatigue.  Lack of appetite throughout the day.  All symptoms continued throughout the day and that night.  Next morning at 7AM muscle aches had subsided except for some aching at injection site.  Took two ibuprofen for that pain.  Felt foggy and fatigued through time of report at 1:22 PM April 13.

She thought it felt muscular but wasn&#39;t sure. The pain was affecting her ability to work today. I advised her to contact her primary care dr&#39;s office or go to urgent care. She called back after seeing her dr today - the dr recommended ibuprofen for pain and said she had a &#34;strong reaction&#34; to the vaccine. According to the patient, no further concerns were identified.

I called the neighbor for help. I couldn&#39;t communicate, my body was shaking, trembling, I stuttered as I was trying to form words. I was taken to hospital by ambulance. I was unable to speak, I was shaking and my blood pressure went up and down. I was given IV fluids and Ativan for anxiety, dysarthria and altered mental state.  As of 04/14 I have memory loss, loss of taste and appetite, extreme fatigue

It felt odd but no other symptoms.  I was at the grocery store and while reading the label of a mustard jar I inadvertently dropped it which was also odd.   This was 2 days ago and at the time it seemed like a harmless mild side effect but now that I see incidence I&#39;m reporting it.

Day after vaccine I felt mild flu symptoms all day and was struck with a severe chest pain and intense nausea in the afternoon. I went to the hospital emergency room and had multiple tests run. No cause was found for the chest pain. It began in the center of my chest and moved to the right side of my back.  I have been dizzy, nauseous and extremely fatigued as well as a headache for the last three weeks. The doctor didn&#39;t know what caused the pain. He checked me for a pulmonary embolism  because my clotting factors were slightly elevated.  They have not been rechecked,  though I requested my doctor have them and my platelets rechecked. I still do not feel well. My brain is foggy, my vision gets blurry at times, and I still have the dizziness,  fatigue and nausea. I am no longer achy and I have not had another chest pain like the one I had on the 26th.

                                                My arm was immediately sore and was sore for a week.  Within a few hours from the vaccine being administered I was tired, hands and feet very cold, chills, headache and a fever.   This lasted for 3 days.  I was and am still fatigued and it has been 2 weeks since my vaccine.  On Friday, April 9, 2021  (8 days after vaccine) I woke up with a sore throat and a swollen gland in my neck on the right side (side of my injection).  The sore throat and my swollen gland is starting to subside on Day 14.  Throughout these whole 14 days I have had hot and cold &#34;flashes&#34; and while I already have anxiety my anxiety has been much worse (feeling of a pounding heart) since the vaccine.  It is not my normal anxiety.  On Day 11, Tuesday April 13, 2021 I woke up with a black spot on the right side of my chin closer to my bottom lip.  It does not hurt, not raised and it is just a black spot.  It is still there on Day 14 and slowly starting to fade but not by much.

                                                I will begin by noting that I am known for high pain tolerance and have been a strong, healthy, professional athlete for thirty years. The evening of the vaccination, I went to bed at 9pm feeling odd. By midnight, I became paralyzed with excruciating pain throughout my torso and arms with such an extreme fever that it felt as if my heart was going to stop. I had crushing chest pain which inhibiting my breathing ability in a way that could only be compared to being crushed under a burning truck. The paralyzation was so intense, with pre-existing pain multiplied by a thousand, that I couldn&#39;t even speak to alert my husband, who was right beside me. This continued for several hours until it subsided enough for me to pass out from exhaustion. The following day I battled residual aches throughout my torso and arms, accompanied by a mild fever. The trauma of fearing for my life that night and over the past week, exacerbated by the news of this vaccine I received being paused for issues related to my demographic, had made me too afraid to report my extreme side effects until now. With the encouragement and support of my family, I have worked up the courage to do so. It was the scariest, most intense pain and fever I have ever experienced in my life all at once and no one I have described this to has ever heard of the severity of what happened to me.

Continued strange feeling in chest and headache, hospital did CAT scans, EKG, bloodwork and could not find what caused all of the symptoms to occur but noted I had the vaccine just 2 weeks prior with a continued symptom leading up to the ?neurological event? and head that continues after as is still present.  Pain and numbness also continues in left arm.

                                                The evening that I got my shot I felt the common side effects like flu symptoms. I also had a rapid heart rate and high blood pressure. It woke me up from sleep. My blood pressure remained high and I felt pressure on my chest for three days. Five days after the shot the pressure on my chest felt worse and my blood pressure was still very high, I also have shortness of breath when I am moving around which started three days after the shot. I saw my doctor who ran some tests which were negative. I am still feeling the pressure on my chest and the shortness of breath after one week but it is a little better than it was and less often.

While I was getting her tylenol she fainted, hitting her head on the floor. When she came to, she started experiencing the chills along with an irregular body temperature. I put blankets on her, gave her water, and tended to her eye. I was able to move her from the floor to the bed within 15 minutes. She fell asleep around 2am. She has been doing better but has been experiencing off &amp; on headaches &amp; nausea. We did not go to the doctor since we do not have insurance.

                                                The day I received the Janssen vaccine, I had pain at the injection site immediately, which was to be expected. My arm was very sore for over a week. I felt ill at dinnertime but was able to eat. Around 10:30 PM I started to feel like my skin was on fire. It was hot to the touch as well. However, I was freezing and couldn&#39;t get warm. My teeth were chattering. I started crying uncontrollably. I have never had tears run so hard down my face. The tears felt like they were burning my skin because my skin felt so hot. I awoke my husband to help me. He wanted to take me to the Emergency Room, but I wanted to wait. My muscles ached terribly. I had to pace back and forth because of the intense pain. My head also felt like it was going to blow off of my body. It wasn&#39;t like a normal headache. It felt like I had swelling in my brain. The left side of my head was sore for days afterwards. I then became terribly nauseated. I didn&#39;t throw up but felt like I was going to. I also felt extremely dehydrated. I was able to drink some water. It was a very long night. Looking back, I probably should have gone to the ER. My husband worked from home the next day so he could be available if needed. It took a long time for me to fully recover. I woke up exhausted and struggled with fatigue for a while and had extreme exhaustion in the evenings. My ears would turn bright red in the evenings and feel hot to the touch. I still have some fatigue now but am mostly better.

                                                The night of the vaccine I had normal symptoms - chills, discomfort, headache. The next day I vomited. For the 15 (FIFTEEN) days that followed I experienced severe nausea. I was unable to eat almost all solid food. I slept about 18 hours per day solid sleep. Blunt headache all the time. Diarrhea started week 2 and the intense nausea did not subside. It was not until a full 15 days later that the nausea finally subsided and I was able to get out of bed for more than a couple of hours at a time. Finally now April 27th I  feel almost back to my normal self.

I exercised on Thursday morning because I felt better (stand up paddling). Then the rest of the day, I was very tired and then Friday and Saturday and Sunday, I was very dizzy, foggy, fatigued, no mental clarity, difficult to hold a conversation and answer questions, no focus. Today, Monday, I still feel like I have a brain fog and am talking very slowly. No focus. Conversations feel tiring.

I was tired for 3 days after. Now the only remaining symptom is living in a fog. I have no health conditions. I am praying this goes away. I am not one to get sick or have any health issues. I don&#39;t use drugs or drink, smoke etc. Very scary. It is impacting my ability to do my job.

                                                Janssen COVID -19 Vaccine. 9 hours after the shot I woke up freezing cold, all my joints hurt, my muscles were stiff, and I felt disoriented. I stayed in bed for a couple of hours. At 5am I got up with all the same symptoms and took my temp which was 101.4. My head hurt like there was too much pressure in my skull. I ate toast and took some ibuprofen and went back to bed. These symptoms lasted for 10 hours. Then for the next 5 hours I just had a fever off and on and fatigue. 3 days after the shot the gland in my left armpit became swollen. It has gone down in size but still sore 5 days later. I still feel tired too.

This lasted about 4 days on the 2nd or 3rd day I had a swollen lymph node under my left armpit. It lasted just a couple of days. On 3/21/2021 I missed my period I did not get it the month of march. Now on the month of April I first started spotting on April 7th it was very light then it went heavy till this day 4/13/2021 I&#39;m still bleeding which is not normal because my period normally only lasts for 4 days. On 3/31/2021 I also had chest pain that lasted for 4 days then it started subsiding. On 3/12/2021 and on 04/11/2021 I got a weird abdominal pain that lasted for less than 5 minutes.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine  On 4/12 I started having a lot of pain overnight, especially the left side of my body. My left hip is hurting really bad, my left arm sometimes hurts. My back is also now hurting. Nothing I take alleviates the pain, I have tried Aleve, Tylenol and Ibuprofen. I am extremely fatigued both day and night now. My bones feel very painful even sometimes down to my feet. While most of my body hurts, the left side seems to hurt more than my right side. When I got the vaccine I felt very &#34;out of body&#34; if that makes any sense, but now I feel very off. I also seem to be bruising easier than I used to before as well.

It came on slowly but by 930 that evening I was shaking uncontrollably for about 3 hours with chills and severe joint pain. My headache grew worse and lingered for several days after as well.  I still have a mild headache today (4/13/21) and feel lethargic and almost foggy.

All of these were the feelings of being &#34;sick&#34; but not fully sick.  By 6pm, I had a 102.2 fever which lasted through the night (approx 4am).  I took 2 Tylenol a total of 3 times throughout the night and drank water.  In addition to the fever, I experienced body aches and was drenched in sweat.  By 6:45 am, I had broken the fever and showered.  I worked throughout the day but felt very foggy in my head and just tired.  I did not have another fever but did sweat through the night again on Wednesday evening.  I had a dull headache on Thursday which eventually went away with OTC meds.  Again exhausted on Thursday evening.  By Friday, I was finally feeling a bit more normal.

                                                Approximately 30 minutes after the injection I developed a significant headache and nausea.    Approximately one hour later if I was in the sun I became overheated, flush and an overall feeling of nervousness,  I adapted to these symptoms knowing they would considered normal but I no longer feel these should be considered normal.  Around 7pm on Monday I started running a fever that started at 101.1.  Between Monday night and Thursday morning it bounced around but stayed between 101.1 and 103.2.  It did not go away completely until Thursday morning.  At least I hope it is gone for good.  On Wednesday around 10am I developed abdominal pain that by 4pm had me sitting by my car unable to continue for about 10 minutes.  It was extremely stressful and still to the time of this report is still has not completely gone away.  The most concerning for me is the back pain with it.  At the time of this report I still have a headache, nausea, abdominal pain with back pain and vertigo.  I have contacted my doctor&#39;s office and they have made notes but suggested I report everything here.  They have started me on baby aspirin and electrolytes as I am also experiencing interment diarrhea.

I have to lay on the other side at nights because it hurts. It is constant pain and Motrin does not help the pain. It is still painful at the end of the day after three weeks.  I went to the ER and they thought that it was nerve damage from the vaccine administration. I was given Steroids which helped a little at first but then the pain returned. It was only a three day course because I am Diabetic and it effects my blood sugar. I can raise my arm a little now but not above my head.  Three weeks after the vaccine my right ear started to ring and it was very intense and I couldn&#39;t hear for about four hours. I went to the ER and all the tests were negative. The ringing in my ears is still coming and going. It is very sensitive to sound and it is hard for me to hear. If there is any loud noise the ringing becomes very uncomfortable. It feels like I need to pop my ear all the time. I was told it might be related to the vaccine. I have never experienced anything like this before.

Overnight I was unable to sleep. About 5a.m.  I was incredibly nauseous. I was incredibly weak. I didn&#39;t have the strength to stand or sit upright.  I sat on the bathroom floor &amp; had to have someone prop me up in front of the commode to vomit into it I was so weak. I repeatedly vomited forcefully for about an hour with accompanying repeated bowel movements. I had a fever.I broke out in a sweat repeatedly - clammy. The most painful part as SEVERE, SHARP NON-STOP ABDOMINAL CRAMPING. I was in the fetal position on the floor writhing in pain after the vomiting &amp; bowel movements slowed. After hours of this... my clamminess turned into chills with my entire body shaking strongly &amp; continuously as I lay on the floor unable to do anything but shiver. I considered going to the emergency room but was able to move in my current state. Who &amp; where should I report this severe adverse event?  Note:  I&#39;m a 45-year old VERY physically fit athletic female.   My only health condition:  I take Enbrel for Rheumatoid Arthritis.

I thought maybe it was my blood pressure being low but the doctor confirmed that the reading was normal for me. It was happening every day for the first week and then nothing the following week.  I was unable to work because I needed to lay down when the dizziness happens. It is still coming back after eight weeks but it is not often, maybe twice a week. It is hard to drive when it is happening. It comes on me all of a sudden when I am sitting down working.

                                                About 2 hours after receiving shot, I was feeling very run-down and sore. My neck had pressure building at the base. Left work early to get rest. My next day entire head and shoulders were pressurized and shooting pains down neck, through arms, numbing left side of body  cramping feet and arms, all triggering anxiety /panic attacks. By Friday I sought help. Urgent care sent me ER because they?d be able to run better tests.  ER gave me an Ativan and sent me mental health referral.  After a couple more days of trying to rest and get ease, went to different urgent care. Received muscle relaxer for cramping, and appointment for primary care provider.  Saw ENT dr for throat, referred to neurologist, had MRI for neck pressure and painful spinal release sensation I feel every morning. Follow-up is end of June. Brain in fog, pressure in head building still daily.  Acupuncturist gave me info for this  Reporting. Been to acupuncture twice, not improving yet.

                                                I was directed to my seat (if walking into the room, the first table but the 2nd seat).  The woman was learning the computer system from a gentleman, and she assured me she just didn&#39;t know the computer, but knew how to give a shot.  I pulled my arm out of my sweatshirt and pushed my short sleeve shirt up.  She did the alcohol wipe, then pinched my arm, I looked away as the shot went in.  I felt a horrible pain...not even sure how to describe it, just extreme pain and very achy and said Ow maybe 3 times (I am one that can tolerate quite a bit of pain, and I assumed it would sting, but this was different) as she was injecting me.  She apologized. The gentleman said Johnson and Johnson is a little thicker.  I said to him that I had never ever experienced this much pain with a vaccine before-never.  Again, I am talking about as it was injected. I went to sit down for the waiting area, the gentleman who was handing out cards for reviews asked me about it and I said it hurt so bad, I&#39;d never had a shot hurt that bad.  Another worker (female) overheard me and asked me if it was a burning-she had a burning with hers (think she said moderna). I said I would not necessarily say it was a burning, it was pain. As I sat there, I texted my husband and told him how bad it hurt (with the injection) and I&#39;ve never had a vaccine hurt like that.  I started to wonder if it was administered incorrectly? I looked over and the gentleman was now doing the vaccines and she was watching. My husband had Pfizer and he said that didn&#39;t hurt at all. I was feeling it up into my neck as I was sitting there. I was trying to rub my arm and neck hoping that would help as well as move my arm around. When we could leave, I asked the volunteer if she had heard of anyone else having that much pain DURING the shot.  She said she only heard of maybe one other person that said ow. I left, started to cry in the car because of the pain and experience, then spoke with my husband before I left. I came home and got some ice to put on my arm hoping that would help. I did expect pain in the arm after a shot. Within a couple of hours, I noticed pain going down my arm and into my wrist. I thought maybe I needed to be active with my arm and move it so tried that.  I started to notice more side effects of the vaccine as the evening progressed:  I had the typical side effects I figured I&#39;d have, achy, joint pain, chills, nauseous, no fever though. I was noticing pain into my neck (occasionally even into jaw), shoulder, scapula area of the back, and left side under the bottom part of my ribs.  I was feeling tightness in my chest, too, so I decided to try 2 aspirin to see if it helped with any symptoms. I did have slight dizziness, and a weird sensation in my head-like a zapping? I didn&#39;t sleep well, and had to stay completely off of my left side. Thursday, I felt better than that night, but still tired, achy, nauseous, chills, and not 100%.  My arm still was really affected...it seemed extremely fatigued as well as painful...the pain was radiating up and down and couldn&#39;t raise my arm without it hurting. Around noon I decided to take 2 aleve to see if that would help me at all. It did help with the pain and achiness, but was getting a &#34;nerve-type&#34; pain still up and down my left arm into neck/scapula area down to my wrist and hand/fingers. Still couldn&#39;t sleep on my left side. Friday, I was definitely doing better with all the other symptoms, I could abduct my arm more than 90 degrees, so I was excited about that. I did wake up with my middle/ring finger hurting (at the base of that area) and a bit numb so put my hand in and out of a fist. The pain subsided, but the numbness/tingling sensation was still there. I continued to take aleve hoping that maybe there was just inflammation around the nerve causing the issue.  Aleve did help, but it still never went away completely.  By late afternoon, I was getting concerned if I was permanently affected by this. As I was holding a bowl of food and eating, my left arm was going numb. I was even feeling it into my gluts (sciatica?). Again...all of this was after the shot and only on the side I received the shot. That evening I was able to lay on my left side, but not for long periods of time because it became uncomfortable and arm would go numb. Saturday, I still had the nerve pain and was not in a good spot.  It made me sad, angry, scared, and I didn&#39;t want to talk about it too much-just wanted my arm and all the different radiating pains I was having to be back to normal. I was feeling it up into my neck, scapula, my side(the rib area I previously mentioned), even into my gluts and down leg near ankle as well as down the arm into elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand, fingers (particularly that middle finger and thumb area).  I tried to use my arm as normally as possible thinking maybe I need to just keep it moving, but it would fatigue, especially between shoulder and neck. I tried Ibuprofen on this day.  Again, the pain relievers helped some, but didn&#39;t take it all away. Sunday I was in a horrible spot mentally and crying throughout the day because of the sensations I was feeling still: up and down the arm, shoulder, neck, scapula, side and still into ankle area. I decided I would call my doctor on Monday. Monday, I woke up and was feeling better overall, but still having the nerve sensations down my arm as well as up into shoulder, neck, scapula and my left side.  But everything was not as intense.  I spoke to my doctor who said there was a protocol, a number I needed to call.  Monday night I took ibuprofen because I started to have a horrible headache-didn&#39;t go away completely and still have this morning-not sure if it&#39;s related or just a normal headache. Still feeling tingling nerve sensations into forearm and fingers.  My shoulder/neck area feels fatigued, but so far not noticing the nerve pain yet, so that&#39;s a positive. On Monday,  it seemed to get worse as the day went on, so we will see. I definitely feel in hand/wrist/fingers as I am typing now. I know this is a lot, and I think I&#39;ve captured it.  Again, I had none of this pre-shot.  The pain during injection is what alarmed me most as I expected side effects after the shot, but not this nerve type issue.  For this to be lasting as long as it is concerns me, and the fact that it exhibits on my left side where I got the shot. I am very anxious as it hasn&#39;t gotten back to normal.

Dizziness lasted for a few minutes which created nausea. Sat at site for approximately 25 minutes after shot. Left arm was sore between shoulder and elbow, which was to be expected. Later in the evening, experienced fatigue. When trying to go to bed around 11pm,  my left are was throbbing. I did take Tylenol at about 6pm. Throughout the AM hours, sever body aches started, extreme fatigue throughout the following day. Flu like symptoms continued the next day.  I had heard of these symptoms for the other shots but not for Johnson and Johnson. Hungry but too weak to actually cook.

Chest tightness and heart racing ? Simply felt I was going to die ? of course I didn?t but it was the worse feeling in life worst than flu symptoms

                                                I had the J&amp;J vaccine on 4/1/21.   I have a history of blood clots. I have tested positive twice. Once back in 2001 when I was pregnant and later on around 2008. I have had these symptoms before, but since I have a rare bone disease and have medical issues I really don&#39;t like to complain and just deal with this stuff with the pain pills I have a prescription for.   Anyway, yesterday I was feeling a little off. My hands, feet and limbs in general tingling. I had a headache which is rare for me and tried to drink extra water, but by 5pmish came I took a handful of tylenol since I had an after work walk to go on with a girlfriend. After the walk I came home and had a desire to lay down and go to sleep. my leg was starting to go from tingle to burn. i decided that i needed to eat some dinner. after dinner i was struggling with breathing while sitting in the recliner chair watching TV, so I told my other half I needed to lay down, this was around 7pm. Then it was just a crazy leg burn from the back of my knee into my foot. I was describing it as if I someone pour gasoline on me and lite the match and I was burning alive. I took a muscle relaxer and forced myself to sleep.   The day after the J&amp;J shot. i had chills and was so cold that mid day when I had breaks during my work from home, i climbed in bed with a heating pad to warm up. the shot also left a scare on my arm, which i found odd since i give myself six injections a week for my bone disease.   I tested positive with Covid December 20th, 2020 and it was a rough first week, but after about 10 days I was pretty much back to walking around and feeling better.    You&#39;re more than welcome to have all of my medical record information, just let me know what you need.   My doctor switched over to a different portal that I don&#39;t have access to and I haven&#39;t talked to her or her office since I had covid back in December and it&#39;s still a few hours before her office opens to report this, but I saw this on the news.   My leg is still tingling and stiff.  Again this is not my first time going through this, so I usually just push through it, but since I saw the news I am reporting it.

My husband would ask me questions and it took longer than normal to respond.  That brain fog seemed to have subsided late afternoon.  By 7pm the same day, I had chills, low grade fever and by 10pm the same day, I experienced extreme body aches, headache, and fast rate heart beat.  I took an Aleve and by 2am, I was able to sleep and my heart rate was down.  The next day, 4/12, I had a hoarse voice, body aches and a headache, no fever.  Heart rate was still pretty fast.

                                                About five minutes after receiving the vaccine I began to feel something was terribly wrong. I then blackout for several minutes. From my son&#39;s description I believe I might of had a seizure. He said my eyes were wide open, I was slumped over, and gurgling. I was completely unresponsive to him. He summoned the paramedics who loaded me in an ambulance soon after I came to. They checked my vitals. My heart rate was 47 bpm and blood pressure was 80/40. They also checked my blood sugar. It was 116. They decided I needed to go to the hospital and began giving me iv fluids in route. At the hospital an EKG was taken, which came out normal, they continued iv fluids, and did a urinalysis on me. All test indicated I was healthy. It about three hours before my blood pressure and heart rate stabilized. Just as long for me to feel like I would be ok. They discharged me at this point. Since they I have just been extra tired and have had muscle discomfort.

                                                Injection was administered very high on shoulder next to what feels like a bone. As injection was being administered I felt pain on inside upper arm down to wrist. Pain subsided. Day progressed. I used my arm to grocery shop. About 6:30 -7:00pm I noticed stiffness and inability to lift arm with extreme pain in attempts to lift arm. During the night had restless sleep. Had to use other hand to move arm into resting positions. No comfortable position.  Saw general practitioner on 4/12/2021. Received a paper with physical therapy exercises. Today, 4/13/2021, Still extreme pain to stretch arm to side and in front. If raising arm overhead with help in range of motion exercises (abduction) cannot lower arm without severe excruciating pain in inner shoulder area. New symptom includes numbness in wrist and forearm.

At night I woke up from deep sleep and started crying that my leg  was hurting badly and felt like something was stuck in my knee couldn?t  move for couple min.  5 min later I got up to take pain medicine and try to walk  and  I was able to walk after that so went to use bathroom ( to urinate) while I got up.   After that since I had pain in my leg earlier  I went to grab  pain medicine than again I started crying and saying I don?t feel good than I passed out completely and was unconscious.   My husband picked me up and brought me to bed and said I had black out and fell on my face  on floor .

                                                Within a half hour of injection, I experienced pain in my left leg (thigh muscle mostly). Throughout the day the pain spread to my left hip and left calf. Additionally, I felt like my muscles were ?on fire? on the left side of my body. I also felt a ?tingling? in my body, fingers and toes, leg muscles, primarily on left side. (I assumed at that time that this was ?normal?.) About 11 hours after injection, I experienced extreme muscle pain all over my body, lasting for about 12 hours. (Flu-like muscle pain and the feeling that all of my muscles were on fire.) The following day, I began to feel the feeling of pins and needles everywhere but primarily on left leg, thigh and calf.  By Thursday evening (three days following injection), I felt the most severe pins and needles feeling as well as ?itching? primarily in calves and hands and feet. I was so uncomfortable and panicked, I couldn?t sleep. On Friday evening, I felt intense leg pain and ?heat? on left side in both calf and thigh muscle and couldn?t sleep. On Saturday evening and all day Sunday I had a headache which I can?t say was related but caused me great concern. Now, eight days later, most of the pins and needles feeling has subsided but the pain in my left leg (thigh muscle) is at an all time high. Extra strength Tylenol is not helping. I did have a consult with my doctor last Thursday and I called again yesterday and I?m waiting for a call back. (Last Thursday, she agreed that my symptoms were unusual and thought I might need to see a neurologist.) Additionally - my left knee has bothered me and feels like someone hit it with a bat. I?m not sure if this is joint pain?  FYI - I have no apparent swelling in legs, no numbness, no trouble breathing and no significant headache today. I never had a fever or chills. The injection site burned for a few days (mild)  but was never red.

                                                That evening at 08:00 pm, I had chills, very slight fever (right under 100 degrees); fatigue. Saturday, I woke up without any of those symptoms but a terrible headache on Saturday morning - I had to go to work. It was severe enough for me to not go to work. Headache remained up until yesterday. The headache was pretty severe on Saturday, Sunday and I went to the doctor on Monday or Tuesday. I went because of the length of time of the headache. No meds were prescribed. They offered a brain scan which I decline based on the Dr&#39;s explanation of what the scan really does. Dr told me to take Tylenol. It was a &#34;cluster&#34; headache - the right side of my head towards the low part of my neck. The headache was always at that location. Tylenol was enough to lower my headache from the moderate to a minor. I didn&#39;t take much of it. I have not had a headache today for the first time since that Saturday. Muscle pain on my upper chest wall - it felt like I had been bench pressing - that symptom was on Wednesday and Thursday of last week (14th and 15th).

Nausea, dizziness, numbness in my left cheek and arm, got a funny taste in my mouth. This got pretty intense and lasted about 10 minutes. They had me stay in observation for another 45 minutes as those symptoms came in waves but never as intense as the first time. They let me go and I went home to rest. On the way home my cheeks became flushed and it felt like my eyes and cheeks were swelling. I had a lot of other symptoms over the next several hours which I wrote down. Early Tuesday morning those symptoms went away and I was left with some flu like symptoms, dizziness and a brain fog like I have never had before.

The headache, fever, chills, and aches subsided after about 36 hours. I had EXTREME fatigue for about 2 weeks, and had some increased heart rate and higher blood pressure as well.  Since the vaccine, i have had vertigo, brain fog, some light headedness and an inability to concentrate. It has affected my ability to drive and work when it is at its worst, and I have had some headaches when I am feeling particularly disoriented.  Sometimes I have trouble completing sentences and finding the right words. I have seen a cardiologist, PCP, and ObGYN and mentioned my sypmtoms to each of them.I had routine bloodwork done, and all was normal there.  It has not improved, and I have an appointment with a neurologist next week. I did not feel this way at all before the vaccine, and it is deeply concerning to me. I am worried about receiving any future vaccines and/or giving them to my children.  Please reach out with follow up information. I did not report it sooner, because I kept thinking it would end, but it has continued.  I am very frustrated and disturbed by this.  thank you.

RN asks patient to elaborate on reasons why she is needing to ambulate and encourages patient to sit for assessment.  She states, &#34;No, I really don&#39;t want to sit, I feel like I need to walk.  I have a tingling down the back of my neck, it really feels warm actually hot, I think if you take my vitals it will only make it worse&#34;.  RN again requests that patient sit and allow for vital signs to be taken, patient refuses, and asks for water.

It felt like my bones were made out of glass and someone had taken a hammer to my bones.  My face was swollen and red.  Unable to sit up.  Walk from bed to toilet only.  Overall, I would say extreme flu-like symptoms.  Temperature 99.6 all day.   I could not take the pain any further at 4:20 pm and took 1,000 mg of Tylenol.  I finally fell asleep and woke up at 8:30pm and could walk again and my fever had broken.  I still don&#39;t feel great, but I think the worst is behind me.

                                                2 hours after the vaccine, I started to feel very achy, and had terrible chills.  That lasted through the night and I woke up with a slight fever, 99.9.  The aches were in my joints and muscles.  It actually felt like I was having back labor. I took advil, and I was able to sleep and sweat out the fever. These symptoms were similar to one of my worst Lupus flares.  These symptoms lasted until Tuesday, 3/9/21, afternoon.  The following Sunday, my joints feel extremely stiff and achy.  Not sure if it has anything to do with the vaccine.  I took Advil and it seemed to help.

The staff noticed I was in some distress and kept asking if I was okay to which I replied I thought I&#39;d be fine once I got some fresh air.  Left the facility to drive home and didn&#39;t feel right, Within 30 minutes, developed chest pains, rash and labored breathing.  I recognize the symptoms as the same symptoms I get when I&#39;ve had morphine, which I now must list as an allergy.  This lasted 4 hours, then got better.  The next day around 1:00, I became ill again with flu-like symptoms and had to leave work.  Headache and body aches mostly.  I was ill with these symptoms for a 24 hour period.  Hopefully all symptoms have passed, except my arm which is red, swollen, itchy and feverish.

I felt like that for the rest of the day. I took Tylenol as the clinic recommended. Then after I went to bed later that evening I developed a headache that woke me up around 3:00am. I was very uncomfortable, experienced chills and was sore all over like I had worked out hard. I also experienced joint pain which I don&#39;t normally have. I still feel rough this morning and running a slight fever of 100F. I just wanted to report my side effects.

                                                Around five hours after shot I felt what I would describe as brain fog and light headache, by the evening I was aching, chilling and had 101 fever. Aches in my muscles and joints as if I had Rocky mountain spotted fever again. That is what the side effects reminded me of. This went on for over 48 hours. I have never been so sick. Very nauseous by next day. Also fell to the floor from nearly passing out the following morning. Took a minute for the light headed To pass. Arm pain still today. It was very scary and seemed to be a very serious reaction. Friday after noon finally started feeling better. The other strange part of this is that my daughter and best friend and I received the shot together in the same lot number and every one of us was deathly ill with the same symptoms. I am the only one with the fainting spells. Still feel fatigued today. And shoulders and left arm injection site still sore and achy.

Saturday night/Sunday -- not 100%, no appetite, intermittent nausea, but able to work/do normal activities. Monday 4/5--nausea at an 8-9 in the morning and kept a trash can next to me during virtual hearings I had that day.   Intermittent nausea throughout the week and not much appetite but made sure I was eating/drinking despite that.   Wednesday night 4/7 -- I went to use a PT stick on my left leg b/c I had felt a little pain in my left knee and figured my quadriceps were fibrotic.  I could barely put any pressure on my left thigh. I had never experienced anything like this.  As soon as I started rolling the stick on my leg, my skin was immediately red and warm and my leg was so sore and tender I had to stop.   Saturday 4/10 -- woke up with severe headache and later that morning felt very weird in my head/heart, like heart racing and my head felt &#34;spinny.&#34;  Felt like I might pass out at one point so I had one of my kids sit on my bed with me until I felt a little better. Sunday 4/11 -- had another episode like Saturday (headache and lightheaded/spinny/pass out feeling/slow speech) and asked neighbor (an RN) to take my BP.  her at-home device said 147 over something and she suggested I go to urgent care just to double check.   About three hours later, I was seen at  urgent care.  BP was normal, heart rate normal, oxygen was 96.  4/13--followed up with primary doctor.  Send me for blood work to check platelets, etc.  Feeling pretty good today but nervous after the news and the pause.

If I laid down I started to wheeze. I was very tired. Monday 4/12 I slept all day until 2:00 p.m. When I got up I felt achy and my throat was sore. I had a dry cough. I could not taste or smell. 4:15 p.m. went to my Doctor and was tested for Strep and Covid 19. I tested positive for Covid 19.

Next day, fatigue and muscle and joint soreness. It continued for almost three weeks. The third week I got calf pain that was very painful. I went to Urgent Care. It lasted until the next day (so for two days total). When I woke up on the 6th it was gone like it wasn&#39;t even there. The third day after the vaccine, the injection site started hurting - but not swollen or anything. The muscle at the injection site still hurts - the pain comes and goes.  I did get an iron transfusion (march 8th) before the vaccine - I had a doctor&#39;s pass to take the vaccine.

                                                Headache and general tiredness began 30-45 min after shot.  Muscle soreness (injection site, rib muscles, leg muscles, back muscles and neck muscles) began soon after.  By 6pm, muscles had become painful.  I had chills but no measurable fever.  I got in the bed but unable to sleep due to muscle pain and discomfort.  Hip joints and back began to ache.  Fever and chills worsened over the next several hours to measurable with highest at 102F.  I took 1000mg tylenol generic which did not lower fever but fever did not rise higher.  Throughout the night, I experienced calf muscle cramps and foot cramps, stomach pains, joint pains, inability to sleep, worsening injection site soreness and armpit soreness (likely lymph node soreness).  Once in middle of night I may have felt chest tightness but I even doubted that I really experienced it as I had been thinking about all the AEs I was experiencing.  Symptoms continued through night.  Next morning, developed a cough so I made appointment to get a COVID exposure test at 1pm on 13th April because I had flown in plane on 10th April.   Cough could have been due to allergy type post-nasal drip because of high pollen in area.  By late Tue evening, I felt better.  Headache had resolved and muscle symptoms improved.  Now (3:45pm on 15th April) I am still experiencing lymph node/armpit soreness and general inability to focus, think clearly.  I feel like I am in a fog.  I emailed a message to my physician and reported this through VAERS

After I come home, I can&#39;t breathe so my husband called 911. I was fainting.  I check everything. I have a problem, I can&#39;t breathe when I read or phone. Now I am better than old. I don&#39;t know what happened. I think it is the problem when I take the vaccine.

                                                Felt like mild flu at first - fatigue, headache, nausea. The nausea continued for a couple of weeks off and on and resulted in vomiting on 4-17-21. I vomit maybe once every few years. The nausea seemed to be slowly resolving, but I began feeling terrible the afternoon of 4-29-21. By 4-30, my feet began throbbing with stabbing pain, pain radiated up to knee in right leg. Entire body pain started, hurt to walk, started vomiting and diarrhea, with fever until 5-3. I still haven?t kept food in me. I used Aleve and Tylenol for fever, drank Pepto to attempt calming stomach, and used ice packs on my feet and a heating pad on stomach to try and decrease the cramping. Don?t know temp, thermometer battery was dead, but went between freezing cold sweating to burning up (dry hot and sweaty at other times).  I can?t attribute feeling like this to anything else and there?s no possibility of being pregnant.

                                                The shot was given very high on my shoulder and was extremely painful. My range of motion was limited, but I thought it was normal because all people report pain, but then a few days later my whole shoulder really started to hurt very badly so that it was even waking me up if I rolled over on it at night. It was very, very sore. I thought I might have injured myself somehow, but recently I was told that some people have this strange shoulder reaction that can come later, so I figured I should report it. It&#39;s been two months now and the intense pain is gone, but I still do not have full range of motion in my left arm. It still hurts if I try to raise my arm straight up. I don&#39;t know if it pierced my bursa or what happened. The pain is deep around the joint of the shoulder.

Continued on while April begin neck pain and severe nerve pain in right arm. Later in April, vision problems in right eye began. May, right arm completely numb, right eye vision problems, balance problems, right leg issues, memory problems, word retention problems. MRIs and x-rays by neurosurgeon in May showed collapsed disc in C5/C6 for no reason (no accident, no trauma) impinging the flow of spinal fluid. Continuing visit to neurologist and another MRI for suspected TIA.  Treatment - multiple medications for nerve pain; surgery scheduled to replace collapsed disc and possible other disc (C4/C5) in June; 2nd MRI scheduled to review brain tissue last week of May.

Felt better the next day, then one week later migraine persisted &amp; all covid symptoms returned at an alarming rate.  Fatigue, fever, hot/cold sweats. Freezing &amp; burning up at the same time. Migraine w/vertigo, loss of taste, no appetite,  restlessness, brain fogged , short term memory loss, blurred vision,  ringing in ears. Vertigo/migraine also worsened w/change in weather, before rain, or a drop in barometric pressure, or increase in humidity, or a cold front coming in.  Any drastic temperature change outside seems to prompt or increase the migraine/vertigo,  dizziness.

Arm was sore but no more than any other vaccine. close to 4 hours later, headache started, felt hot and cold. Hard to sleep, sweating a lot during the night. Headache was so bad it felt like a combination of a bad flu with a hangover. felt very thirty. In the morning I was dizzy, hot, cold, temp 99.8, sick to my stomach, coudn&#39;t taste food very well, just like when you have the flu, nothing taste good. I spend the following day in and out of sleep, very tired, hard to focus. The sensation for being hot and cold continued. Took Imitrex to alleviate the headache/migraine . I did help, but not much. Hard to eat due to an upset stomach. Today is the first full day. I hope I&#39;m better tomorrow

I have had pain in my left arm from the shoulder to the elbow for the past 5 days and it seems to get worse.  Ibuprofen and Tylenol did not seem to help much.  It is difficult to use the arm because of the pain .  I can?t sleep right now so I figured I would fill this out.

                                                The next day after the shot, I had a small rash on my wrist.  It disappeared during the day.  Saturday evening, my right thigh felt like it received a trauma like a hit, but I did not have an injury.  An area the size of my hand is slightly pink on the thigh.  On Tuesday, I tried starting ibuprofen, but it did not really remedy the pain.  I went to urgent care Wed. evening.  They sent me for an ultrasound to rule out blood clots.  No blood clots, but lymph nodes were visible in ultrasound.  They suggested I follow-up with PCP.  On Thursday and Friday, the leg felt crampy but less painful.  Friday night the pain traveled down my right leg to ankle as well as right lower lung had dull ache.  Returned to urgent care.  They are treating the leg for cellulitis (1000mg daily of generic Keflex.)  They said if the leg felt better in 24 hrs, probably cellulitis, but if not, it might be a response to vaccine.  There is no relief after 3 doses and 24 hr &#43; later.

When I got out of bed I was lightheaded and passed out in the bathroom as I was getting Tylenol.  I took 2 Tylenol and had diarrhea about 10 mins later.  I went to get some gatorade and passed out again in the hallway on the way to the kitchen.  About an hour after taking Tylenol symptoms began to improve but became nauseous and couldn&#39;t get back to sleep.  As of 2pm Sunday current symptoms are extreme nausea and extreme exhaustion.

No other symptoms that day. Today is Tuesday,  March 23 and I am still experiencing side effects from the vaccine. The side effects, other than the &#34;brain ache&#34; come and go. The side effects include what I can describe as a &#34;brain&#34; ache, some itching (3/16), random sweating, arms feeling like dead weight, overall general feeling sick, random body aches (don&#39;t last long), dragging of feet when walking, noises being louder than what they actually are, brain &#34;fog&#34;, dizziness, nausea, tingling in legs and feet .  What I describe as a &#34;brain ache is a different feeling than a headache or migraine.  It is as if my brain actually hurts. A very notable side effect that occurred on  Wednesday, March 17, was an episode of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. Throughout my life I have experienced AIWS  at bedtime.  On Wednesday, I experienced an episode during the day and it lasted for three hours.  My session is going to log me out.  I cannot type anymore.  Please contact me for more inforamtion.

                                                Severe diarrhea on Sat then vomiting the next morning, Sun.  I was in bed all day Sunday unable to do much with a headache and lethargy.  I woke a bit better on Monday but still had a headache.  Today, Tuesday I feel foggy brained and don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m breathing at full capacity.

                                                Immediately after the shot I started feeling tingling in my left hand fingers. At 2 pm I started feeling warm, not feverish. 12 hours after the shot I started feeling achy and cold. When I woke up on March 25th, I was achy, with chills and internal heat, no fever though. Basically every muscle hurt and I really couldn&#39;t move.  I spent the entire day in bed unable to eat or even move. I had to take the day off from work.   I think I had Covid in Feb 2020 before testing began. The symptoms I felt in February 2020 were exactly the same beginning 12 hours after the vaccine.

                                                I received the J&amp;J shot in the arm at 12:30 PM on 4/6.  At 7:00 PM -I started experiencing severe muscle cramping in both arms and both legs.  By 9:00 PM  chills started and were added to the severe muscle cramping experienced earlier. I took one Ibuprofen pill at 10:00 PM and tried going to sleep.  I was up all night with insomnia and muscular pain.  I had a low grade temperature of 100.3 starting around 12:30 AM.  Today, 4/7 I&#39;ve had low grade temperature around 99 and severe muscle cramping in both legs early morning.  Right now at 4:30 PM on 4/7, my temp is gone but I remain extremely fatigued and have muscle cramping in both legs.  I tried taking a nap today and failed to sleep. The last time I was able to sleep was Monday night 4/5. I am hoping this will resolve itself by tomorrow 4/8.  If symptoms don&#39;t resolve by 4/8 I will contact my PCP on 4/9. Thank you hope this information helps. I didn&#39;t expect to have insomnia as a symptom of this vaccine.

Just didn?t feel right through day and took blood pressure at approx 5pm. Reading was 171/108.  Took a clonidine (which I have on hand in emergency. This was only the 2nd time I?ve ever taken it) I emailed my doctor a short time later. Doctor advises if symptoms progressed to go to ER(although sent following morning, I did not see until Thurs evening) Friday morning met with Doctor.  Fingers still feel peculiar but BP ok.

When I woke up at 10:30 am Saturday my face was extremely swollen.  My left side seemed to be more swollen then my right side.  Called Dr. on Monday &amp; decided to wait a few days.  Also started to have diarrhea as well on Monday.  The swelling was better by Friday.  Also found that I was having trouble sleeping even though I was feeling extremely tired.  That Thursday I had an extreme burning in my stomach. Only way I can describe it is that it felt like there were flames in my stomach. The burning was so bad that it was making me extremely nauseous.  Friday the burning was better but the burning is still coming &amp;going but no where near as bad as the first time.  Please note that I stopped all vitamins &amp; supplements after I received the shot on Friday.  Im only still taking my adder all.

                                                About 8 days after the shot, my stomach started to have weird pains.  Those lasted from Thursday April 15 through Sunday April 18.  Starting Monday morning April 19 I began to experience intense diarrhea for all of Monday.  It has continued, although less intensely, Tuesday April 20 and Wed April 21.

                                                I got the J&amp;J covid vaccine on 4/10/2021 at 11:40am.  Later on that day, my left arm was sore so I took Tylenol.  After my shower that night around 10pm, I felt cold/shaky/chills &amp; had really weird dreams.   The next morning (4/11/2021), I slept in late &amp; was very tired when I woke up.  I also had a headache, fever (100.2F) &amp; nausea. Took 2 Tylenol 500 mg each  &amp; these symptoms went away later that night.   Two days after the vaccine, on 4/12/2021, I woke up with itchy red rashes all over both of my legs &amp; feet (~30 small-med size). Took 2 doses of Zyrtec &amp; Benadryl 50mg twice that day so it wouldn?t itch so much. Also applied mometasone ointment to rashes.   On 4/13/2021, I did a video visit with a doctor.  She said my rashes were probably due to an immune response to the J&amp;J covid vaccine (meaning it is working) &amp; it didn?t look serious since it was only on my legs.  She said to continue the Zyrtec up to 2x/day, Benadryl every 6 hrs if needed, &amp; apply mometasone steroid ointment for the rashes 1x/day.  On 4/14/2021, the rashes have improved and I had less than 10 rashes on my legs.  Since I still had some rashes, I continued to take 1 Zyrtec 10mg in the morning &amp; applied mometasone ointment to the rashes.   On 4/16/2021, the rashes had resolved.

                                                On the night of my J&amp;J my vaccine , I felt very tired and sleepy but I could not sleep. The next morning I felt a burning sensation to my eyes as well to my right ear and that went away. I went to see my PCP that day as well because I was having a pressure sensation down my right calf and leg. On Wednesday I felt numbness sensation down my right arm and the right side of my body was weak. On Thursday, I called my PCP who advised me to go to the ER and to get monitored for thrombosis. I also began to have headaches and blurry vision. At the ER they performed an ultrasound and did lab work. The ultrasound exam did not show evidence of thrombosis or blood clots. The ER physicians told me to rest and elevate my legs. I also noticed that  my BP was 130/90 which I never had before. To this day I still have throbbing sensation to my right calf and leg.  I again went to the ER and thy monitored me. They told me to take Ibuprofen for pain and again did an ultrasound which did not show any blood clots. I then started to have a burning sensation to my skull and scalp and also my left arm. I have not fully recovered from my symptoms.

My husband took my temperature which was 103.  Massive headaches, full body aches and pains, chills which made my body shake uncontrollably.   My whole body hurt.  Could not get up to use the restroom, tried and fainted back into the bed.  Heart felt like it was beating out of my chest.  My husband wanted to call 911 but I didn&#39;t want to.  Felt like I had COVID again.

Fingertips tingling, leg cramp if walk, can&#39;t form word, sharp pain on collar bone (only happen once). Janssen vaccine was administered on Apr 12, 2021. On the same day I have severe headache and mild pain on muscle. Severe headache extends to the next day and occasionally happen during the first week along with mild to moderate muscle pain. On the second week (Apr 19 to Apr 23, 2021) have frequent muscle pain, muscle on calf becomes stiff and harden and occur more frequent. It alternates between right calf and right forearm. I also often have tingling on fingertips, numbness on hand and feeling fuzzy on arm, legs. Symptoms comes and goes but get worse if have short walk. Foot and back of the knee on right leg cramp and more stiffness and more pain. On May 2, I woke up with numbness on my right foot and discover red spot on the instep. This prompt me to go to Urgent care. Since numbness and feeling of fuzzy along arms and legs but at the urgent care could not diagnose since they don&#39;t have tools to run the test so they advise if it bothers me, I should go to the ER. I worry about high cost of ER so I went home and plan to go see family doctor on Monday but just 5 minutes away from urgent care, I have trouble saying out the word that I want to say. It just doesn&#39;t come out although I try to form a word. At that point I more concern if I would have stroke so I ask my husband to turn around to go to Emergency Room. While waiting to be treated, numbness occurs more on feet and under of the forearms, Doctor run blood test, order ultrasounds, MRI scan on the head and EKG. All result came back normal but numbness and headache still persistent. I was discharge in the evening but still have no idea what cause it. The discharge paper indicate that it is &#34;Paresthesia&#34; and I believe Janssen vaccine is the cause for all the symptoms that I have. I still have numbness on feet and leg stiffness still occur even sit down for less than 5 minutes. Should the staff administered the Moderna type that I have signed up for. I believe this side effect won&#39;t happen to me. I signed up for Moderna but after check in, the staff show a note &#34;L@837&#34; to the fire fighter. I don&#39;t know what it means but heard their conversation that &#34;We don&#39;t do that today&#34; then after vaccine was administered, I found out that it is Janssen that I have not signed up for.

Wednesday, Thursday and Friday - I had headaches and I had extra fatigue (I already do have fatigue because I have insomnia). My arm soreness was on the other arm not on the one that I had an injection. Friday and up until yesterday, I had nausea. Saturday, I had headache and being tired. Sunday, I had chest pain (woke up with it) like a burning in my chest. My left arm, I felt a tingling down my arm to my legs - it almost felt like a blood clot was there in my arm. I had to put heat on and then ice. I couldn&#39;t extend arm because it hurt. Midnight on Monday, the burning and the chest pain was too much and I was getting worried. The only thing I have is asthma, otherwise I&#39;m healthy. I went to ER - they gave a Cocktail of Lidocaine; Malex and something else to see if it would help with the burning in my chest.  Monday, I took Tylenol. Tuesday, the chest pains were more intense.  03:00 on Wednesday am - I went back to ER. They brought me to a full chest x-ray - front, side and back and a CAT SCAN and gave me another Cocktail and also put something in my IV. This time,  they sent me home with four different medicines. The meds are: Generic of Nexium; Aspirin low dose of 81 mg - bayers children - one a day; Generic version of Bentil Triacetin   - I take this when I want to be still; Generic version of Valium - they gave me four of these - and I have one left that I will take tonight so I can sleep. I am taking Vit D. I haven&#39;t taken Tylenol since getting on these. I try to stay hydrated.  I still have a really really funny feeling inside me. Last night, I was very restless and couldn&#39;t sleep. It makes me on borderline and dizzy and my heart starts palpitating. It&#39;s a scary feeling in my chest.

I reported the blurred vision to the Pharmacist and she said they have not heard reports forth this symptom.  Based upon events following the injection relative to my blood pressure; it is likely that my blood pressure became elevated following the injection, resulting in blurred vision.  My blurred vision   resolved several minutes later.  However, my heart rate increased later that evening to the point I slept upright in my recliner that evening.  During sleep, I awoke from my sleep gasping because my heart felt like it was beating too slowly.  It has not been several weeks since receiving the injection, and during this time period, my Blood Pressure (BP) has been fluctuating from &#34;very high&#34; to normal.  Yesterday, I presented to the ER due to High Blood Pressure (145/100), by the recommendation of a NP.   I have NEVER had any history of high BP prior to the injection.

I had a very severe headache and felt very nauseous.   I was not able to sleep well during the night.  The next day, between 7 am and 5 pm, I stayed in bed with the most severe headache I have ever had, severe nausea and extreme fatigue, and sometimes felt hot and/or had mild chills.   I was not able to go to work, as I could not get out of bed.  I was finally able to get up around 5 pm (24 hours after shot) and eat a little something as the nausea had finally subsided.  I was still very fatigued and had a less severe headache.  I was able to sleep well that night, and woke the next day (about 36-37 hours after shot) with only a slight headache, which went away with a few hours.

                                                Patient immediately felt pain in her arm and then described feeling &#34;woozy&#34;. She was given a quiet place to sit and then lie down. She was given water, juice, and snacks. She felt dizzy and a bit nauseated at times. She admitted to not having eaten anything prior to the vaccine. At 1500, an hour after she received the vaccine she felt like her heart was racing and she reported that the whole right side of her body felt cold. People with her that knew her well stated that she &#34;was not herself&#34;. She also reported at this time that she felt like her heart was racing. This nurse recommended, by phone (patient had left the clinic site by this time) that the patient&#39;s mother take her in to urgent care or the ED, just to be sure everything was okay. Upon follow up, the patient did not go in but called the ED triage nurse. She was told this was likely a normal response to the vaccine. Patient went home to rest and her mother stayed with her overnight. Today client is back at work- tired and sore but nothing more reported.

                                                On the day of my vaccine I had typical symptoms - chills, fatigue, and headache.  The next day I felt better, just tired.  On Tuesday the 23rd I returned to work and felt fine, but I did have an occasion of dizziness and I was tired.  I felt good on the 24th and returned to life/exercise as normal.  I woke up on the 25th in the early morning with a strange sensation in my head.  (I described it to my husband that it felt like I had worms in my head.)  When I got up I experienced dizziness that seemed like vertigo.  I tried to proceed with my day, but I got an intense headache, loss of appetite, and sore upper leg muscles.   I reached out to my doctors office.  I saw a doctor on the 26th.  (My dizziness was better, but I still had a headache and muscle aches.)  We discussed vertigo and possible reactions to the vaccine.  He also found some liquid in my ears and so we questioned allergies.  I got allergy medicine and took it when I got home.   The next day in the early morning the headache and muscle aches returned and I called a hotline through my doctor&#39;s office.  (The headache was quite intense.)  I spoke with a nurse - I was concerned that I may have Covid.  We discussed my reaching out to get a test if my symptoms were not better by Monday.  By Sunday I was feeling a bit better.  My headache had improved but I still had muscle aches in my legs.  I determined I would be able to go back to work on Monday.   The last symptom to remain was aches in my legs.  On Wednesday the aches were in my upper legs , by 3/30 the aches were in my ankles.  I was feeling better by early April.

                                                I waited in the pharmacy for 15 minutes; soon after I got in my car to drive home and felt a strange sensation on the left side of my face.  While driving, my entire left side went numb.   I kept checking my face in the rear-view mirror to see if it was drooping.  It was not.  My upper lip  appeared and felt swollen.   Six days later, on March 28th, I came down with a really bad migraine.  It started in my left eye and then was a really bad headache.  I called the eye doctor the following day because the pain was not subsiding.  The migraine lasted from Sunday, March 28th to Wednesday, March 31st.   Following the migraine, I have been getting headaches (not as severe, but still painful) almost daily.   The headache is not over my eyes or in the temple.   Instead the headaches are on the top of my head and towards the back.    Today is three weeks and two days after my vaccine, and I am still having headaches on the top of my head.

                                                Background: With Chrohn&#39;s and with the Erythromycin - I had some fatigue; stomach upset; and joint pain. I didn&#39;t go into it with no symptoms. These that I am reporting would be increased. I could feel injection go into the arm. By the morning of the 15th, I think, increase joint pain and fatigue from my baseline. My knees; feet hands - achy in the joints themselves. Fatigue: wishing I could have a nap throughout the day. These lasted for about a week. I had stomach upset that I believe may have been from the Erythromycin - but that didn&#39;t change that stomach upset - still had it... it may have gotten a little worse (the nausea. By morning of the 23rd, I took 2 mg Ondansetron for that nausea. That helped a lot with the nausea. Around 2 am on the 24th, I woke up from a very bad nightmare and I woke up with a pounding heartrate. My chest was really thumping. I got up to the bathroom. My heart kept pounding harder and faster and didn&#39;t come down. My watch said tit started going up to:  122 to 144  to 154 and it kept gradually going up. I was petting the dog and sitting in the recliner. I phone my Dr&#39;s on-call number and spoke to him on the phone. I called 9-1-1 by his advice. Paramedics came - Heartrate stayed up.  I was still able to walk around the house. I followed up to their truck and they checked me over. By that time as they were taking my vitals my heart rate started to calm down.  (It was elevated about 15 minutes about all together) My blood pressure - 160 over 110 when the paramedics checked me but that was coming down as they had me at the truck and the heart rate went down to 80-90 and was continuing to go down. It hasn&#39;t come back.  They listened to my heart. Never had that happen to me before like that. Didn&#39;t have to go to ER. I do have the apple records of my heart rate, etc. if needed. The joint pain and fatigue faded back to my baseline.

                                                About 3 hours after receiving the , vaccine on April 5 at 3:15 pm, I had uncontrollable shivers and chills, shaking violently through my whole entire body.  I was freezing cold to the bone.   I felt nauseous and threw up my entire dinner.  That didn&#39;t make the nausea go away - I continued to throw up that evening 5 or 6 more times.  The nausea continued the next day making me throw up 3 more times.  And yet the nausea persisted for a whole entire week.  I had a horrible headache that night that has stuck with me these last ten days.  My muscles ached and shot strange pangs through my body.  I was exhausted.  I could not stay awake.  I was so weak and tired.  I had no energy and just laid in bed for a solid four days. My throat hurt, my neck hurt, my head hurt, my arm where the shot went in hurt so bad.  Very strangely, my stomach was constantly bloated and hurt inside like a bad stomach ache - even if I hadn&#39;t eaten anything it still bloated and hurt.  The painful stomach lasted seven or eight days.  I had diarrhea for those seven /eight days.  I was completely dehydrated.  The diarrhea lasted way too long - it was difficult to return to work.  The second day after the shot I woke up to my left eye red, like some blood vessels had burst.  It took four or five days for my eye to go back to normal.   my heart has a stabbing feeling randomly all the time now and it is hard to breathe.  I wheeze and cough all the time.  It is very uncomfortable.  This heart issue has persisted the entire time since getting the vaccine.

I was very unsteady on my feet and needed help to the bathroom. I missed work that day but went to work the next day. I felt very poorly with no energy for a week. I was super achy and have no balance. I have gotten stabbing pains in my legs especially in my right thigh which dissipate after a while. It has been ten days and I am still very tired with intermittent headaches, but I was able to work out today. My leg pain is less often and less than it used to be.

                                                That evening, I began to have difficulty breathing as I did after out of quarantine from COVID. I used my inhaler prescribed to me from having covid in November of 2020. That helped. Then about a week later I started to have leg pain. Not sharp pain, but achey pain in both legs that can not be controlled by Tylenol or Ibuprofen. It has been occurring every few days and some nights like last night are bothersome and I can not sleep well. Also after about a week, I had dryness and redness on the bottom part of my mouth and chin.  In the last week I have had flush on my neck and chest.  It is hot, sometimes causes dryness and pealing and is sometimes itchy.

                                                The adverse reactions of light headedness, throat irritation, heaviness in my chest and difficulty inhaling began about 20 min after my injection, It lasted 5 minutes. About 30 min afterwards the 2nd wave of reaction came on, with the same symptoms but was even harder to inhale and lasted twice as long. I took a combination of benadryl, motrin and pepcid which alleviated the worst of the symptoms after about an hour. To this day, I still cannot take a deep breath in.  About 72 hours after the vaccine I began to have diarrhea (and still have it 20 days later), lethargy, nausea and shortness of breath. The next day I had a little more energy, but still had continued shortness of breath. My vision had become less clear and my thought process a bit fuzzy. This is still happening today. Seven days after the vaccine,  I suddenly became extremely light headed just simply walking. To the extent that I needed to sit or lay down before I began to pass out. After the light headedness came on heavily, I also noticed a very heavy weight on my upper chest and found it quite difficult to inhale. These moments would come and go throughout the day. Regardless of whether I was just sitting and relaxing or walking around. These symptoms would last anywhere from a couple minutes to a couple of hours. I found it very hard to catch my breath and could feel my heart flushing often. Additionally I would wake in the middle of the night feeling that I needed to gasp for air. I sought medical assistance from a clinic, an ER and even my allergist and I am scheduled to see my family physician later this week.   I am not an anxious person, but have experienced many episodes in the last 20 days that have truly made me feel that I was going to die (no exaggeration!) due to the inability to breathe or that I may have been having a heart attack. I began to have chest pain that would travel from the center of my chest to my left shoulder. The pain also would move to my right lung area. During this I also had heaviness in my chest and felt I could not breathe in or out easily. I am still very light headed and have difficulty walking very far without taking a break because I feel I cannot catch my breath. I still have all of the same symptoms that I experienced 20 minutes after my vaccine. These symptoms have varied in intensity. I have often commented to my family that I feel the symptoms of the chest heaviness and heart flushing seem to come in waves. I am a health conscious person and have never had poor health in my life. The events in the last few weeks have definitely taught me how terrible life must be for those who chronically suffer from heart or lung issues. I am still currently battling these symptoms, however, the last few days seem the symptoms have often been less severe.

                                                Seven hours after I got the vaccine, I got a severe headache. It lasted all night and into the next day. I called the Nurse and she told me it might last two days. I tried multiple pain killers, and nothing worked. After twenty four hours I had a pressure sensation in my head. My normal Migraines cause dizziness. This time my head felt very full and it lasted 24 hours. On the third day I started to get light-headed ,and it lasted all day. Four days after the vaccine I started to get a more general headache and it lasted all day and it came and went for a few more days. Ice packs worked to relieve the pain with Aleve. I did not feel normal for twelve days after the vaccine.

                                                Eleven Hours after the vaccine I got a fever body aches, chills and chest pain. The fever and flu symptoms went away after 24 hours but the stabbing chest pain lasted for 37 days. The pain was in the center of my chest in different places and it felt like tightening and clenching. The D-Dimer  was elevated and other tests were normal. My Platelets were tested later and were normal. Doctors indicated it was an inflammatory immune response. I went to a Cardiologist for a Stress test which showed ST depression. The chest pain stopped after 37 days. I did have shortness of breath which came and went over the course of four weeks. I am normally in good shape and I run, dance and work out two to four times a week. I have been unable to work out since this began. I also had lightheadedness, chest pain and palpitations seemed to go together. I still have lower back pain and Tinnitus which started two and a half weeks after the shot. It has been five weeks.

                                                Shortly after getting the shot she reported feeling &#34;off&#34; as she was driving she started feeling short of breath and her heart was racing. When she got home around 5 PM she was still feeling short of breath and reported that her heart was racing. She was unable to speak clearly, but was stating that it was due to be being short of breath.  She also reported feeling lethargic and fell asleep until the next morning. She slept until approximately 12 pm the next day. When she woke up she reported feeling right sided cheek tingling. At that time she thought she had just slept wrong. When she attempted to walk down stairs she was limping and reported just feeling very weak on her left side. On Wednesday she slept in late again complaining of lethargy. When she awoke that Wednesday (3/10) her speech was markedly slurred. She was also saying things that didn&#39;t make sense. She was dragging her left leg when she tried to walk. We immediately took her to the ER and she was worked up for stroke. When she was triaged in the ER we mentioned that she had just had her COVID vaccine and voiced concerned that maybe she had a reaction to her COVID vaccine. She was admitted to hospital on 3/10 for a possible stroke.  Her MRI was done later on 3/11, Her MRI showed that she has strokes on both sides of her brain in the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. The doctor referred to her stroke as being caused by a &#34;showering of clots&#34;. The doctor said this usually only happens to someone with cardiac issues. My mom has no cardiac history. Her doctor ordered an 2D Echo of her heart and no abnormalities were found (3/12).   She is still disabled from her stroke. She was hospitalized from 3/10 - 3/16. She was the discharged to other care facility from 3/16-3/26. She is currently needing outpatient rehab in a day neuro program. She attends this at outpatient facility. She has to walk with a cane due to persistent left leg weakness. Her speech has a slight slur, and she suffers from short term memory loss. She intermittently has trouble with her equilibrium and reports feeling dizzy. She sometimes has a hard time swallowing or says that it doesn&#39;t feel right when  she swallows. She also trouble with word retrieval. She has left-sided neglect which correlates  left eye visual deficits. She currently requires care from a general physician, neurologist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, neuro ophthalmologist and neuo psychologist. She was started on a new medication regime 325 mg aspirin daily, plavix for 21 days (now completed), metformin, amlodipine, coreg and losartan. She is going to need outpatient rehab until at least June from the last update we received from her rehab doctor.

I walked down my road singing and laughing just total delirium.    Maybe  bad choice of word but I don&#39;t know how to completely describe the disorientation.    My son, helped me get back home in which I laid down on the grass and just stared at the sky. My son, assisted me in to my home in which I slept several hours and woke up about 8:30 pm.      I feel embarrassed of my behavior although I know for a fact it is correlated to the vaccine shot.

                                                The adverse reactions of light headedness, throat irritation, heaviness in my chest and difficulty inhaling began about 20 min after my injection, It lasted 5 minutes. About 30 min afterwards the 2nd wave of reaction came on, with the same symptoms but was even harder to inhale and lasted twice as long. I took a combination of benadryl, motrin and pepcid which alleviated the worst of the symptoms after about an hour. To this day, I still cannot take a deep breath in.  About 72 hours after the vaccine I began to have diarrhea (and still have it 20 days later), lethargy, nausea and shortness of breath. The next day I had a little more energy, but still had continued shortness of breath. My vision had become less clear and my thought process a bit fuzzy. This is still happening today. Seven days after the vaccine,  I suddenly became extremely light headed just simply walking. To the extent that I needed to sit or lay down before I began to pass out. After the light headedness came on heavily, I also noticed a very heavy weight on my upper chest and found it quite difficult to inhale. These moments would come and go throughout the day. Regardless of whether I was just sitting and relaxing or walking around. These symptoms would last anywhere from a couple minutes to a couple of hours. I found it very hard to catch my breath and could feel my heart flushing often. Additionally I would wake in the middle of the night feeling that I needed to gasp for air. I sought medical assistance from a clinic, an ER and even my allergist and I am scheduled to see my family physician later this week.   I am not an anxious person, but have experienced many episodes in the last 20 days that have truly made me feel that I was going to die (no exaggeration!) due to the inability to breathe or that I may have been having a heart attack. I began to have chest pain that would travel from the center of my chest to my left shoulder. The pain also would move to my right lung area. During this I also had heaviness in my chest and felt I could not breathe in or out easily. I am still very light headed and have difficulty walking very far without taking a break because I feel I cannot catch my breath. I still have all of the same symptoms that I experienced 20 minutes after my vaccine. These symptoms have varied in intensity. I have often commented to my family that I feel the symptoms of the chest heaviness and heart flushing seem to come in waves. I am a health conscious person and have never had poor health in my life. The events in the last few weeks have definitely taught me how terrible life must be for those who chronically suffer from heart or lung issues. I am still currently battling these symptoms, however, the last few days seem the symptoms have often been less severe.

                                                Three weeks after vaccination woke up with aching pain in legs and feet. Within 48 hours it progressed to roaming pain in arms, legs, hands, and feet which includes general aching pain, occasional muscle cramp, numb sensations that come and go - hours at a time, some tingling, very significant pain in feet when trying to walk barefoot on sand. About 10 or 11 days after that onset, I developed vertigo, having the feeling of being tipped to the left nearly constantly. Symptoms are interfering with my ability to go about daily activities, slowing me down, especially the vertigo. The pain persists even in the night.  It has been 18 days with no improvement and I am waiting for an appointment with a neurologist.

I woke up at 3am Friday morning with body aches and still had the headache. I took more Tylenol. By 9am Friday morning I had severe adverse reactions. I still had a severe headache and body aches with muscle soreness and extreme fatigue. I also experienced chills, light sensitivity and brain fog. Around 4:30 pm I developed chest pains that lasted about one hour. My headache, body aches and fatigue have not subsided as of today. I have had a televisit with my physicians office on may 10 where bloodwork. Some of my headaches rk was requested. The results showed elevated kidney function due to the amount of Advil I had taken to control the headache and muscle soreness. The recommended Tylenol did not alleviate my headache or muscle soreness so I have not taken either medicine.  Some of my headaches have been accompanied with nausea and light sensitivity. I went for a physical exam on 5/18/21 and more bloodwork was requested. It has been 6 weeks and these adverse effects have not subsided.

This lasted through the night, along with a sharp pain in my chest that developed in the night and radiated from front to back, which made it difficult to sleep. During the night, I took some rolaids and moved the couch to sleep more upright, because I think the pain may have been heartburn or some other GI thing (I rarely get this feeling, but I have had it before, and my last meal of the day was several hours before i went to bed and before my symptoms started). By morning the next day (Sunday), my whole left arm was achy, down to my hand and fingers, and my right arm also but not as severe. My left armpit felt tender (and still does today, but not as bad).  By mid-day, I started to feel better, the fever was gone, and by late afternoon, the body aches were gone. My left arm and hand was still tender, but not as bad. By Sunday night i would say I was back to about 80%, and by Monday morning, 95%, and by late Monday morning, back to normal, other than the slight tenderness I still feel (today being Tuesday) in my left armpit.

                                                I had the shot on weds afternoon. On Thursday I felt ill with flu-like symptoms, mainly body aches and headache. These symptoms were gone by Friday and I felt great. I woke up Saturday morning at 4:30am and needed to use the bathroom/, which is about 10 steps from my bed. As I entered the bathroom I completely blacked out, causing me to fall and break my ribs. This has never happened to me, and there was nothing else wrong with me (I spent 2 days in the hospital checking heart, brain, inner ear, etc). In addition to the 4:30am blackout, it also happened again several hours later at 11am, saturday morning. This time I again got so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stay on my feet, and while my husband was right there lowering me to the floor I was in a daze, a cold sweat, and absolutely no control over it.

                                                At 12 hours through 16 hours after administration of the vaccine I experienced rigorous shivers, feeling freezing cold to the bone for hours and couldn&#39;t get warm (even with piles of blankets), periodic heart pain and some chest pressure, periodic knife like stabbing pain in my right knee, mild nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, severe weakness, sometimes a cough.  At 16 hours I got up to get water and had to hold onto things to keep my balance. After drinking a couple of cups of water, I turned away from the bathroom sink and lost consciousness, fainting and falling onto my bathroom floor. The jolt of the fall woke me up and it took a lot of strength to get up. The symptoms were vicious. When I fainted, the brunt of my weight must of been on my upper left rib cage. My ribs were so sore for a week. It was difficult to walk, breath, blow my nose, or cough.  My health provider recommended a Tylenol regime for pain control so that I could take deep breaths and prevent pneumonia. I had a low grade fever of 99 degrees F for one to two days following the vaccine. During the week that followed I felt periodically very ill, had a constant headache for a day or two, and had extremely foggy thinking and sometimes confusion.  I was very fatigued all week long. I lost my appetite and have still not gained my typical appetite back. Day 8 to 9 is when I was finally feeling closer to normal. Today I feel I may be back to 100%, but my rib cage is still healing, either from a contusion, fracture, or break (likely a contusion).

                                                10 days after the vaccine I developed dizziness, tachycardia, dry mouth,chest pressure, shortness of breath and felt like I was going to pass out, and I had a feeling of extreme doom. I was transported to a clinic. There I had a heart rate of 140 with irregular beats. Continued feeling of doom. An EKG showed ST depression. Symptoms improved with nitroglycerin. The clinic didn&#39;t have the technology to provide care so I was emergently transported again. At that hospital my D-dimer was positive and that lead to a CT Angiogram. This showed a pulmonary embolism. Doppler studies of both legs were negative. I was placed on Heparin for several hours and then switched to Eliquis. About 6 hours after being on Eliquis I had the exact same original symptoms and again nitro was given which helped the symptoms. I was placed back on Heparin for a longer period of time. Once I was anticoagulated I was then switch to Eliquis 10mg BID for 7 days then 5mg BID for 6-9 months. I had a CT Angiogram of the head and neck which was normal. At this time I still have dizziness with standing and intermittently with sitting, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath.

Slight dizziness the following day intermittently but not too bad but dizzy while walking the dog midway through the  20 minute walk.  Woke fine the next day and the next. Saturday night it felt like I was coming down with something as I started running a small fever, felt burning hot, nausea( no puking), loss of appetite, dizziness, clouded head, stuffiness.  Thought it was allergies to the cat but I have never had such a reaction, ever, and I have been near this cat numerous times before.  Woke up in the morning feeling fine like nothing was wrong, except slight loss of appetite but was eating.  Have been fine since.

                                                I received my shot at 10 a.m. on a Thursday morning. Around 6 p.m. on the evening of the shot, I began experiencing severe chills, and I threw up once. The chills lasted approximately four hours. In addition, I had an extreme headache. Once the chills subsided, I began sweating profusely through my clothes. I still had the headache. Around 2 a.m. in the morning, I was unable to stand or speak for about an hour.  Once I was finally able to move again, my skin - not my body, but my skin - hurt all over. I could not lay on my back due to extreme pain in my skin, particularly the skin on my back, shoulders and buttocks. Anything that touched my skin, no matter how light of a touch, felt like I was being severely bruised. My skin was in pain for about four hours. The sweating continued through the following Sunday morning.  I soaked through multiple sets of clothing and woke up every morning completely drenched. When I weighed myself Sunday morning, concerned about dehydration, the scale reflected a 4.2 pound weight loss over the course of less than three full days.  The headache lasted through Tuesday, April 14th, a total of five days with a strong headache. I am still experiencing some sweating but not like the initial round of sweating. Because my shot was given on a Thursday, I only missed one full day of work. However, had the shot been given at the beginning of the week, I am confident that I would have missed at least three full days, it was so debilitating.

                                                I got the vaccine Apr7th afternoon. While at injection of the J&amp;J Covid vaccine to my left arm, I could felt strong but manageable pain. Except minor pain from the arm, I felt all fine till going to bed that night. I started to get a headache and discomfort all over my body that night and couldn&#39;t sleep at all. Next day Apr 8th, my headache became much worse. I also felt extremely tired and got a low fever (98.3 - 99 F). I had to lie in bed for the whole morning. After taking Tylenol in the afternoon, my temperature came down to normal and my headache was also relived. I got a normal sleep Apr8th night, and felt all fine from Apr 9th till now (Apr 14th).

                                                The night of the vaccination (3/8), my body felt very hot (not fever) like it was going to catch on fire.  I took Tylenol to be safe and went to bed taking it as a sign that the vaccine was working.  I thought I was mostly over the next day, but four days later on 3/12, I started bleeding only two weeks after my last period, and the it was quite different than usual - very fresh blood and lots of it.  This continued for 15 days at time with very heavy flow - I bleed non-stop, and I worried that I was going to bleed to death.  The worst adverse effect happened 10 days after the vaccination on 3/18.  Out of blue without anything unusual, I started feeling very dizzy, nausea, and vomiting.  After much vomiting, nausea stopped, but the dizziness just got so bad, I couldn&#39;t move or even keep my eyes open (things were spinning even with my eyes closed).  I couldn&#39;t even stand up by myself.  This most horrible severe vertigo lasted two and got gradually better.  It took about 5 days before I felt safe enough to be alone by myself.  During this time, I had a excruciating headache on my left side.  It was so bad, I quickly took some painkillers which knock me out for a day.  The important thing is that I don&#39;t ever get headaches; this is the first one I had aside from one I had when going through IVF more than a decade ago.

                                                The night after the night of my vaccine I had a tightening of my whole left side, from my eye, down my neck, into my shoulder and chest and down left arm.  Then I started to get shooting pain all around my shoulder blades.  I brushed it off thinking that most people had complaints of feeling pain or sick the few days after their vaccines and then they said it went away.  Mine never went away.  After about 5 days it really started to worry me.  The pain was very intense- unbearable even- and i couldnt move my left arm or lie back in any way without incredible pain.  I called urgent care and they told me I could come in if the pain was bad but that maybe I wanted to see my regular physician to see what was going on.  I made an appointment with my doctor but it wasn?t until the end of the next week.  After 8 days, I couldn?t take it anymore.  I went to urgent care- they did an EKG and a chest xray and said all was normal.  They gave me an anti-inflammatory (naproxen) and a muscle relaxer. They took blood and the only thing they noted to me was that I should have my doctor check my platelette count.  They told me they thought it must be muscular.  I went home.  Neither of those medications seemed to help.  The pain was less in the day when I was moving around, but towards the end of the day it was getting so bad (still is) that I can?t sleep or get comfortable.  My doctor did blood work and couldn?t seem to find the source of what was going on with me either.  She prescribed me a new anti-inflammatory (meloxicam), a new muscle relaxer (cyclobenzaprine) and a pain killer (hydrocodone acetamin).  Sometimes those medications help- they knock me out- but when I wake up I feel the same.  I can?t take them in the day because they make me too loopy and tired.  I don?t know what is wrong. I can?t seem to get answers and  nobody can figure it out.  It is definitely my left side. I feel it in ky head, my chest, my shoulder and down my left arm and it has been almost 5 weeks.  It seems to be getting worse not better.  Looking for help or direction please

It came together &amp; was quick like feeling inside of my nose swell &amp; slight headache. I WAS VACCINATED WITH MY DAUGHTER 18 YRS OLD WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES AND SON 20 WITH PRIOR HISTORY OF DENGUE IN PHILIPPINES. At night as it was getting dark,severe symptoms hit us at home all around the same time. Severe excruciating pain in the back of our head and it ran down into our necks &amp; jaw. I have had migraines &amp; it was worse pain in the back of the head. My son said it felt like dengue when he spent a week in the hospital,which comes with low platelets count. To me it felt like when I had infection in my left mound after double mastectomy and spent five days in hospital hooked to Ivs with 2 antibiotics &amp; they thought I had staff &amp; going septic. I had horrible headache with that. My daughter reacted the worse,she was crying with head pain &amp; shivering non-stop &amp; her body aches hit all over first. She slept with a hot pad on her head &amp; had ringing in the ears &amp; if she tried to get up she heard rushing water sound in ears &amp; felt like going to pass out. My body aches hit as I was trying to get strength to drive to ER if needs be,but if felt like crippling arthritis in arms wrists jaw legs knees &amp; ankles. I slept with hit pad on my head &amp; would move it to joints. Really none of us slept. Son had body aches all night too. Bad headache in back of head for all of us. Took 2 arthritis tylenil. All had stomach aches. Yesterday I was spinning &amp; severely dizzy. We are fatigued &amp; barely moving.

Also started feeling some tightness in the left eye today. Have a Dr appointment but on May 17th and going to urgent care today. Advised to go to HCF instead of urgent just to ensure they can get imaging, US and appropriate testing&#39;s to r/o all cause of complications.  4/20-f/u pc to caller; couldn&#39;t sleep last night; used a heating pad on her leg but didn&#39;t work; states both legs hurt; feel tight; 4/10 pain; worried when also saw spots on her left leg and became concerned because saw news of clots; the episode started with tightness of her right leg which progressed to most of leg as well as left leg. Has not gotten worse today and denies any concominant effects. Normally healthy. Did not go to the hospital because says she wouldn&#39;t be able to afford it. Has appointment with primary care in 2 weeks.   rec&#39;d that since she is still ok today then it&#39;s likely ok to skip the ER and go see MD as planned; warned to go to the ER right away or dial 911 if any of the following effects: sudden shortness of breath, severe headache, vision changes, loss of motor or/sensory function, chest pain. Call us back if having any effects at all besides the ones already noted so we may help determine if needs ER care.

It feels deep as if in the bone.  There is no rash or swelling and never was a rash or swelling. This persistent ache is over a month now and has not diminished.  I did have mild fever and felt puny 2 days after the shot which is fine/expected and that went away.  The arm pain concerns me.

                                                Within 5 minutes from receiving my J&amp;J vaccine, I went to sit down and I started feeling very hot in my body. My heart started to race, had chest discomfort and had trouble breathing, my trachea closed up, had blurry vision and pain in my chest. I felt like I could not breathe and when the nurse came over to ask me I could not speak to her, I went into a shock and I was placed on the floor and I could not hear anything nor could open my eyes, from my hips down to my feet I could not feel anything, my legs went completely numb and I had a syncope. What I was told from the nurse that I was given an Epi-pen to help with my reaction. When I came back my body was having convulsions, felt my head spinning, had pain in my chest that so very intense and the nurse got me up and took me to a nearby ambulance and the EMT staff placed like a heart monitor because my heart was racing super fast. I also felt heaviness in my chest and inside the ambulance I was given two injections on my left arm and when I slowly started coming back, I was already at the hospital. I was at the hospital from 2pm to 4:30pm more less being monitored.  At the hospital x-ray of the chest was performed as well as lab work and I was discharged home. When I got home, I still did not feel good, I felt heaviness to my chest, still have trouble breathing and get chills during the night. I also could not stand up and have a nerve sensation to my body and the chest pain to my left side is still very present. I have blurry vision, dizziness, headaches, and my heart-beat continues to race very fast.  I get headaches, have abdominal pain and I peed blood few times then that&#39;s when I was able to pee, my abdominal pain was painful like having a baby. On Friday 04-08-2021, I again went to the hospital because I had fallen to the floor on my kitchen floor and my daughter took me to the hospital. I let the nurse staff know that I still have continued chest pain and pressure, difficulty breathing and headaches, dizziness and they monitored and gave me three pills as medication. I was discharged home about 5pm with a referral to see a neurologist due to my chest pain, blurry vision, dizziness and fever which I had these past three weeks. I do not know why I felt all these symptoms after my J&amp;J vaccine.

She was then getting very confused and just couldn&#39;t focus when the doctor asked for her medical condition and needed to call in her mom to assist because she was beginning to panic, blood pressure did go up and was then given Benadryl, within this time she had drank 2 big cups of water, after the ice pack and benadryl the bones felt better but not okay. She said an hour after the vaccine,  the shoulder and neck area felt bad for 10 days after, she still has irritating pain in her neck and shoulder, on 4/30/21 she got a migraine and it hasn&#39;t gone away since, she is unable to return to work, since the migraine she has gone to the ER twice, an acute care once and a neurologist, she can&#39;t be in front of a screen or read a book it hurts to think, when she tried looking at a screen after 1 hour she couldn&#39;t continue,   today on 5/17/21 she can&#39;t bear the shoulder pain,

                                                Hello, I received the J&amp;J vaccine on 3/12/2021. Eight days later on the 20th when I went to bed I had a lot of pain in my left heel and left thumb.   The next day, on a Sunday, the pain was now in my left heel, left thumb at the big knuckle and top and bottom below my thumb, and just behind the inside of my left ankle, and I had a terrible headache.   I was unable to grasp anything or widen my grip because the pain was so intense in my thumb.  It was so bad I went to my local ER who did xrays and told me it was just osteoarthritis.   The next day,  Monday, the pain was terrible. It was in my left thumb, the middle of my left hand, left ankle, the arch of my left foot top and bottom, the big knuckle at the bottom of my left big toe, my right hand was also now hurting at my middle finger the big knuckle at the bottom. I went to see my family doctor who really was unsure at the time what was going on and said it&#39;s still just must be the osteoarthritis. The next day on Tuesday I still have the headache I was out unable to open my own water bottles or prescription bottles because the pain was so intense in my left hand. It was now extremely painful to walk on my left foot and I had no appetite. The following day on Wednesday the pain was bad and my right hand that I was unable to touch my ring finger or my pinky with my thumb. As hard as I try my thumb just would not reach those two fingers oh. I now couldn&#39;t open any of the doors in my house unless I use the base of my Palms on both hands turn the knob. I now couldn&#39;t even comb my own hair or pull my pants up wipe myself properly. I couldn&#39;t hold a pencil or anything because the pain was so unbearable. I had no appetite and now I have diarrhea. I called my husband at work and had him come home and we went to the emergency room because it was a bigger facility. The doctor there told me he thought it was something more like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. This was by far my worst d ay even though I was unable to work this entire week. Oh and did I mention the only reason I got that back who was because my boss with bullying me and pressuring me every day to get the vaccine. He even went so far as to come of my office and he wanted to use my keyboard to schedule my vaccine himself. The next day on Thursday I was still having a hard time walking I still couldn&#39;t touch my ring finger on my pinky with my right hand still unable to open anything with either one of my hands. My husband had to open all the water bottles and prescription bottles and just set the caps on them before he went to work.  I now had flashing light in my eyes which lasted about a week. The following day I had all the same symptoms but now my left foot was so swollen I couldn&#39;t even get a shoe on it. The big knuckle at the base of my right hand hurts so bad at this point and so does the big knuckle at the base of my left thumb. The swelling and the pain is just unbearable at this point. The following day on Saturday my mom had come up from Florida and stay with me for two weeks take care of me someday the next day on March 28th I start all the same symptoms but now my muscles were quivering on the back of both thighs. By the middle of next week I still had all of the same pain and now I&#39;m realizing that I can&#39;t span open my fingers on my right hand and I&#39;m unable to snap my fingers. Side note as of today I still cannot snap my fingers on my right hand. At this point I have been keeping a diary every day of where my pain was in what the pain level was each day. So strange that it&#39;s affecting joints on both sides but just in my hands the inside of my wrist and my left foot. Are April 28th I finally got into the rheumatologist. He had me go to the hospital and get blood work done and x-rays. On Thursday May 6th I was unable to go to work. It seems like I can go to work about 3 days a week and the pain is so intense that I&#39;m missing about two days a week. Dr called me and said all of my tests came negative for rheumatoid arthritis.He told me not just because I was a patient but if I was his own sister he would suggest going to the Clinic right away. He said they have a larger database and if anybody else was having the same reaction to the covid vaccine they would know about it. My husband came home from work and made the four-hour drive to the Clinic. I was there Thursday and Friday they the blood work a sonogram x-rays the whole gamut of tests. The rheumatologist in the ER said that he thinks it&#39;s still something like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus but that was in the early stages and not showing up positive on the test. On Friday I met with dr. a rheumatologist oh, and the chairman at the Clinic. They said this is a very rare reaction to the J&amp;J vaccine and they&#39;re hopeful by prescribing me a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and Voltaren gel that hopefully I will have some relief within a week and they were hopeful that the symptoms will go away within 3 months. They also took me off work for the next week. Did I mention got the first month that was going on they have me on 50 mg of Prednisone for one week then 100 mg of Prednisone for 2 weeks and then back down to 50 mg for one week. After being on that high dosage of Prednisone for an entire month I still have all of the swelling and pain in my joints. My joints are very stiff at this point. The prednisone maybe eased the pain just a touch but the pain and swelling was definitely there, and the pain is excruciating. I&#39;m feeling so alone, and scared because I don&#39;t know anybody else that&#39;s having the same reaction. I&#39;m also fearful I&#39;m going to lose my job I&#39;m missing so much work. But I also feel like my boss pressured me into this and now I&#39;m suffering. If anybody is having the same reactions to Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine please reach out to me. I have my vaccination card I can show you and I have a ton of doctor and  hospital records to verify my story. I&#39;m really worried because I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on with me, how long it&#39;s going to last, and is it going to come back if I do get these symptoms to go away.  My work place offers no paid extended leave, and has repeatedly asked me I&#39;d I was quitting my job.   I&#39;m only having these problems because I was pressured and bullied into getting this vaccine. I completely blame my boss. I would have never got vaccinated if he wasn&#39;t on me about it every single day repeatedly. I&#39;m at a loss as to what to do from here. I have no income coming in. Do I qualify for unemployment or some sort of disability benefits? If anybody can please give me some suggestions I&#39;m open to whatever you have to say

                                                I received my vaccine about 3pm Sat. April 3rd. About an hour or so later I started to feel ?run down? but nothing major. At 9pm I began getting chills but did not feel feverish. By 9:15 my body was aggressively trembling. Even my teeth were chattering. I could not control the shaking. I put many layers of blankets on me and turned my heat up to 80 in an effort to get warm. At some point I dozed off. I woke up at 12:30am and had a fever of a little over 101 degrees.  I fell asleep about 3am, still aggressively shaking.  I woke up at 9am (April 4th) and my head was throbbing. My fever was now 102.2. Also, every muscle in my back and shoulders ached. I sat up because I needed to get to the kitchen for some water. Once I stood up, my body felt like it was weighed down by heavy sandbags. I could barely walk to my kitchen and back. I went back to bed and covered up in massive blankets and tried to stay still. I did not take any pain reliever because I was too nervous to.  I never had any nausea but smells bothered me and I had no appetite. My fever stayed at 102.2 until I went to sleep (around 10pm).  Monday (April 5th) I still had chills but much milder. My temp was just over 101 all day. My head felt better but my muscles still hurt. By late evening (10pm) my fever was just over 99 degrees. I was feeling better and I no longer had chills.  Tuesday (April 6th) I woke up fever free. I felt mostly normal again except for my muscle aches.  Today is Friday (April 9th) and I continue to have muscle aches. The worst of it is in my lower back and it?s pretty severe. It feels like I lifted heavy weights with my lower back muscles. I have not been seen by a Doctor yet as I have no insurance. I?m not sure if I need to or not.   I wanted to contact you because I am a healthy person and what I experienced was BRUTAL. I have NO IDEA how a frail or vulnerable person could go through what I went through. Also, people need to know that they may have to take time off of work to deal with these side effects.

                                                Vaccine received at approximately 1:30pm.  Around 6pm, had noticeable chills, progressing to severe chills by 7pm.  Muscle aches and headache also began about that time.  Went to sleep.  Around 1:30 woke up with nausea and sweaty chills.  Walking to the bathroom was difficult due to extreme fatigue.  Fever measured at 103 degrees.  Took Tylenol.  Nausea resolved by 7am 4/10, but had no appetite. Fatigue throughout day (4/10) - slept most of the day.  As of 7am on 4/11, mostly better.  Remaining symptoms are a lingering headache, moderate fatigue, and vaccine site muscle soreness.  Perhaps some brain fog, as this form seems challenging and it shouldn&#39;t. Note:  I had had little sleep the week prior to the vaccine, which may have affected my reaction.

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction which began immediately upon injection at 2:45Pm (roughly) into arm with wide spread hives covering the entire right arm and spread to left arm right leg. Head and neck, face became numb and I felt like I was going to pass out. Neck numbness/swelling moved to front of neck within five minutes. Itching of left leg. Was able to maintain consciousness but was very out of it. Possibly from lack of oxygen when neck and head swelled. Began to lose ability to recite address or remember address by the time was placed in paramedic van. Paramedic put IV in hand. Paramedics administered ephedrine, Benadryl, prednisone and reaction subsided. Was taken directly to hospital arrived there for monitoring by 3:15 Pm . Felt much better at hospital.  Had one wave/head rush where it felt like the reaction was starting again and may pass out but that subsided and they continued to monitor. Had a few waves of nausea which did not last long. The IV placed in hand by paramedic was infiltrated so attempts at giving fluids failed and it was never corrected at hospital. After 2 hours of monitoring I was told to go home and given a prescription for steroids. I was asked to monitor for the remainder of the night for any trouble breathing. Night sleep was not good waking often with one occasion of wheezing which subsided after taking Benadryl. Continue to monitor.

I woke up at about 4:00 a.m. with a severe cramp in the left calf and I had to jump around until it loosened up.  It was extremely sore afterwards.  I was exhausted all day on Wednesday and my legs hurt the entire day.  By Thursday my legs were a little better and by Friday it was significantly better.  I am still feeling some pain in my left calf but it?s not all the time.

I did not eat this week except very minimal crackers or toast.  Thursday I vomited, Friday I stayed home from work and vomited again. Saturday- Sunday I did not work but slept all day. Monday, I had a work appointment that I went to.  It lasted about 2 hours when I vomited some more. Tuesday-Wednesday while I wanted to go to work, did not feel at all confident in my ability to not vomit as well as hot and cold spells. My abdomen has been distended throughout this with several days of not being comfortable touching this area  I have not seen a physician, however health department said I should report this and I did email   my gastroenterologist at the university  about what I have been experiencing

Within first 3-4 hours had bad rash on arms, legs, face, neck and chest, fast heartrate, breathing and out of it sensation. I felt like I was having a partial analpylaxis reaction - like throat 1/2 closed but that I would be ok. I took Benadryl and used a Ventolin inhaler. Rash was better by 2nd day.  On 2nd and 3rd day I was having massive headache (felt like pressure from inside all over out to all cranial sutures), severe neck stiffness on rt side, lumbar vertebrate pain, iliosacral and hip pain, felt painful radiating spasms down my left and right legs, also jaw and teeth pain. Taking Naproxen and now ASA.  Very shakey and jittery. Occasionally have lower arm pain and numbness on left side. Also have injection site symptoms but minor compared to above. It&#39;s been 1 week and allergic part of rxn is over but concerned with possible neuro and bloodclot possibilties..  On day 2 or 3 I also had problems with my brain with reading comprahension.

Onset of right eye not blinking/closing. * MAR 21st = Emergency Room.  Diagnosed w/ BELLS PALSY.  [Ruled out stroke]  The following week after my vaccination (approximately MAR 15th), I experienced a strange feeling at the back of my throat.  It can best described as a &#34;sore throat&#34;.  I noticed it upon waking up.   I could feel it at the back of my throat when swallowing;  the act of swallowing would enable me to &#34;feel&#34; the sensation at the back of my throat.  This was unusual and not normal for me.  I thought I was coming down with a cold virus.  I had not been sick for over a year and thought it was a strange feeling.  I was concerned.  With the recent schools, restaurants, and gyms opening up with less restrictions, I learned from coworkers that there was an increase of illnesses  because our immune systems are not as strong and germs are easily transferable during the usual interactions.  Therefore, I expected my sore throat to be the start of a harmless cold virus.   Then, later in the week (MAR 19th), I noticed my eyes were abnormally dripping tears.  It is my experience that I get this effect in the office setting or during winter when my eyes are &#34;dry&#34;.  However, I was neither in the workplace (office), nor was it winter.  I was not sure why my eyes had excessive tears coming out.  Finally, on SUN (MAR 21st), an obvious physical symptom finally became apparent to me and my family members.  My speech was impaired.  I could not chew properly.  I could not drink from a cup.  I struggled during breakfast.  I was not sure if I was having a STROKE.  I recited the alphabet to hear for a slurred speech.  I looked in the mirror, and my smile was not perfect.   I got dressed and went to the Emergency Room.   The doctors performed physical PUSH-PULL tests, eye tests, etc.   DIAGNOSIS = Bells Palsy.     OTHER SYMPTOMS = &#43; shortness of breath.  &#43; leg swelling.  &#43; headaches.  &#43; excruciating pain in the neck, especially during sleep (laying down).

                                                Right after the dose I got an immediate headache, dizzy and light headed. About an hour later I became nauseous and my face became very flush red and hot. I went to bed and woke up feeling like I got hit by a truck and was very tired with a sore arm. By the next day I was better. The following week I began with a red hot circle on my arm where the shot was given, it had a ring around it. That lasted for about a week. I then started to get stinging sensations in that part of my arm like I was being stung by a bee. These lasted for about 2 days. I then started getting muscle rolls/spasms in the same spot on that arm. They lasted about 3 days. I then started having pain in that arm like I had just gotten the shot and as I was rubbing it, I noticed a large indent in my arm. I went to the doctor, and they said they had no idea why it happened but if I get more symptoms to come back. The doc appt was on 4/12/21. It has been over a month of these side effects. Doctor not sure if it will be a permanent disfigure.

Those lasted until Sunday at 09:00. It just abruptly stopped. I woke up with rash all over my face and itchy and swollen eyes on Saturday and I went to the eye doctor on Saturday. I was given eye drops and and an anti-histamine; That is helping. I am still a little bit itchy on my face but it&#39;s better.

                                                Bad headache developed on April 8th at 11 AM.  By 2:30,  needed to sleep.  Unconscious for 3 and 1/2 days.   I have no recollection of any of this time.  I?m only listening to what have  told by the medical field and my family.   My husband started calling MEDICAL CENTER Friday morning and A called the helicopter by Friday afternoon at three.   They were ruling out a stroke.  By the time they landed the helicopter they knew it was not a stroke and started doing testing like CAT scans , lumbar punctures.  From what I?ve been told they ran four antibiotics IVs.  I remember waking up Sunday morning and someone was sitting in the chair next to me and all I kept saying was that I was hungry.  The lady started crying and said that I had been unconscious.  She tried to tell me who I was and that I was something called married and that I had children.  She tried to explain what had happened but I wasn?t able to comprehend.  I didn?t know what it meant that I lived on a farm or that I had animals.  Or that we had a vet practice.   I remember medical people asking me who I was and what the date was and if I remember how I got there and all I could do was smile.   It?s like the words just would not come.  And they diagnosed it as an cephalitis over the next couple days.  Where the brain swells up and you have memory loss and I had a high fever.  I had a lot of nausea after they put me on oral anabiotic?s.  I kept hearing from nurse reports that I had almost died.  These were hard things to here.  I?m forever thankful for all the people that have gone before me for doing the drug trials.    I am a energetic lady and I?m slowly getting back to myself.  I feel very thankful for the great care at the medical center.  I appreciate everything that you do every day.   I would not recommend getting vaccinated with this drug.  I am one of the healthiest people that I know. No I can?t believe this is happened to me.  I take good care and eat healthy and have no bad habits. I meditate and pray and have a joy filled life.

                                                Within 6 hours after the vaccination, I experienced significant chills, then high fever, then body aches, then intense nausea. These symptoms were as expected and seemed to subside within 48 hours. However, the nausea did not subside and for the following 2 weeks, I experienced significant &#39;waves&#39; of nausea brought on by various factors such as car/plane (motion sickness), sun exposure (75 degrees on a beach for 20 minutes), various foods, etc.   Approximately one week after the vaccination, I had several glasses of red wine (4 glasses within an 8 hour time period). I am not a big drinker, so this amount caused me to feel intoxicated but not enough to be completely inebriated. I slept for 6 hours and woke up feeling &#39;drunk&#39;- extremely dizzy and nauseous. I proceeded to vomit non-stop (approximately 7 times) over the following 6 hours and could not get the nausea under control. In fact, I had to have a physician prescribe Zofran to stop the dizziness and nausea or else I was going to need fluids administered. This is extremely unusual for me. It felt like the nausea I had been feeling from the vaccine had somehow been intensified 10-fold because of the wine. The Zofran helped immensely however, the nausea (slight at this point- back down to what it was prior to the alcohol episode) continued to persist for another two weeks and a half weeks. A few days ago, it felt like I &#39;turned the corner&#39;.  I am now three weeks out from the vaccination and the nausea is almost gone (90% gone).

                                                Reported adverse effects to J&amp;J after a horrible day/night from severe allergic reaction. We were 5 hrs from home, on a weekend, could not get vaccines in our county. Drove to  County. After the 15 min when walking out of the building noticed strong metallic taste in mouth (no fillings), thought odd. Then while driving noticed red blemishes/rash on neck, swelling of my tongue. Once arrived at hotel (too far to drive back home and not feeling well), noticed red rash on front of neck, ear lobes bright red, hot to the touch and swollen. Vertigo and low fever came on along with elevated heart rate. These lasted all Saturday into Sunday. Didn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t sleep Saturday night, Sunday morning rash on face with heart rate BPM elevated all day with fever and bad vertigo. All these symptoms continued all week with exception to the rash and swollen tongue those subsided late Sunday. The vertigo, fevers, skin sensitivity and complete fatigue along with bump at injection site persisted even to today.

                                                By 6pm I noticed something wasn?t right. I could t get warm, even when sitting in the sunshine. By 9pm the chills had turned to fever. My temperature at 9pm was 101.2F.  I also had a headache and started to feel a bit shaky.  By 10pm I had body aches and was in bed with 3 blankets on me and still could not get warm. My temp was 102.7 at 10pm. I tried to sleep. At midnight I awoke to a fever of 104.8 and could only cry. The worst body aches, headache, racing heart and dizziness, nausea and vomiting (after additional aspirin were taken to relieve the fever). I was very weak in an alarmingly rapid period. I stayed in this condition until approximately 6:30am on 4/26. At 7am my temp was 102.5 and I found it hard to make it back and forth to the bathroom, due to dizziness and weakness. By noon, the temp was back up to 103.1 and I could barely cry, as I suspected I was then  close to dehydration. I focused on hydration and slept as much as possible. The fever slowly came down to its current 100.4 at 11pm on 4/27.  This has been an alarming reaction to a vaccine. I have had serum sickness previously, so maybe that is a factor that should also be considered. I hope this is helpful.

                                                She got her vaccine, she felt the burning sensation all the way down to her fingers and her wrist.  I proceeded to go forward and wait the 15 minutes.  She then started to have pain in the side of her neck on the right side, discomfort and pain in her arm.  Within the hour she started to have headaches (has had COVID in the past).  She went home and it was a nagging pain in her arm, not at the site but the whole arm was sore and limited using the arm due to the discomfort.  That night is when she came on the news and started that the vaccine was being pulled from administration.  That night it was like a pulling sensation right in her upper arm, up near the armpit and the fatty tissue from the breast and where you raise your arm.  When she started noticing the discoloration started in her skin.  Her hands started getting black, under both arms were black, the back of her legs was black, and she started feeling worsening fatigue.  She started getting worried and was looking at how her veins turned purple blue/green just in the one arm.  She was trying to figure out why she had limited use of her arm, and was holding it as if she had a sling on it as when it hung to her side it had the pulling sensation and a crawling sensation in her veins (that night and going into the next day).  The next morning she was so exhausted and tired, as was her mother who had the vaccine at the same time, and was not feeling well.  She was feeling that possibly due to the fibromyalgia she was have worsening symptoms than her mother.  She then started bruises on her body, on the arm itself as if somebody grabbed and squeezed her arm, purplish/black bruising.  It had her forearm develop 3 large pockets of swollen, almost as if the medicine was sitting in her arm.   She was slowly getting the pulling sensation down to her hand, and she called the UC first and due to the high volume of COVID she wanted to know how long of a wait she would have.  They instructed her to go to the ER due to the development of the blood clots on the news.  There was no change in her symptoms, and got to the point that she could not move her arm, and the knots stayed in there and there was a reddish discoloration around them.  Now she was having a pulling sensation in her chest and palpitations of pain near her heart.  She was having soreness in her legs to the point that she was not able to walk, and felt it was in her nerves 3 days after the vaccine.  She stayed in the bed the entire week just due to the exhaustion and effects.   Every time she would go to reach for something she would have the pulling sensation down to her hand, and the entire arm was swollen with the bruising all over.  Her body started having purple and blue knots and also in the left leg.  Her arm and fingers were swollen as well.  She then started having itching of her arm, and her lips started swelling and got up and went to Hospital and was able to be seen.  She was having problems with her stomach as well, having a knot in the stomach where it was protruding and started loosing weight since the vaccine.    The ER doctor told her she had a reaction to the vaccine, and did a Doppler to see if she had blood clots.  They did not give her the results and didn&#39;t feel that she didn&#39;t have problems.  She also went to the UC and back and forth to the ER, and still had the knots and finally looked at the knots and her jaw was swollen, and her arm was still swollen.  The UC told her that she was having a fibromyalgia flare.  She is still having the same symptoms green/blue and have started protruding.   Due to the fatigue she has mainly just stayed in bed and knew that she was to have COVID symptoms, but knows that the crawling sensation and the knots sitting in her arm, and now her arm looks disfigured and the swelling is not going down.  They told her that the test was negative for the blood clots.  She had made an appointment with her neurologist and has an APT on Tuesday 5/25/21.   She continues to loose weight no matter how much she consumes and still continues to have the knots and pain in the arm.

I then went to sleep and on Saturday morning when I woke up my right wrist was itching a lot as well as  my legs, buttocks and hands. All over my body was red and very itchy. I did not sleep due to the itchiness on Saturday night. I developed little red bumps on my entire body. I ate lentils for food but I do not think it was the food. I went to urgent care and saw a doctor who gave me Benadryl, took one dose and then it slowly started to go away.

I woke at 5:30 the next morning with a fever of 99.9 F, a headache, chills and body aches.  These symptoms continued throughout the day and were alleviated somewhat by tylenol.  I slept a large part of the day and felt better when I woke the next day, Monday.  On Monday I felt mostly normal but still had some body aches including a back ache on my left side.  I also had more injection site pain and a red rash about a half dollar in size that was tender to touch and by night time was itchy.

Around 4pm the same day I had bad neck pain. And pounding heading, about 1 hour later starting getting chills and fatigued. By 10pm had body aches and muscles pains. I took some Motrin and went to bed. I couldn?t sleep as my mind kept racing. In the morning (day after vaccine) I was feeling worse. All symptoms continued in full force and I couldn?t get out of bed. 10am I was able to drink some Alka seltzer cold medicine and lay back down. I continued to have chills pounding headache bodyaches muscle aches and sweating, but no fever. I felt like I had a bad case of the flu. I?ve continued taking 600 mg Motrin every eight hours and this has helped with the pains and bodyaches. Day 3 woke up feeling much better, noticed a funny smell in my nose, I haven?t been blowing my nose or had any mucus, but I can?t explain the smell. I still have body aches and muscles pains.

I received shot, and within a minute or two- my lips and tongue started to tingle, swell and go numb.  My throat started to swell too.  Had a hard time starting to breathe and took my xopenex inhaler.  I had taken a benadryl beforehand, and ended up taking two more as EMT came over to  help me there at the site.  She kept an eye on me.  My A Fib was speeding up and getting irregular too.  After about half an hour, it stopped getting worse and seemed to level off.  They offered to take me to ER, and had me promise to call 911 if it got bad again.  Still felt bad the rest of the day.  Felt a little better later the next day, and a little better (today is day 3), but still not 100%.  I did contact my doctor to check in

                                                Severe dizziness, nausea, sweating, shaky. Woke in the middle of the night with these symptoms and was having difficulty walking. Almost called 911 and decided against it. Feeling better today for 4/11/21. Still having shakiness, nausea, and some cold and flu-like symptoms.

                                                Thursday, 7 hours after the vaccine: nausea, headache, fever, chills through the night.  I felt my heart feel like it was occasionally fluttering (overall felt this about 4 times).  Restlessness through the night.  I took two Tylenol at 10pm, one Tylenol at 4 am and one Tylenol at 6am.  The Tylenol helped but I could tell when it was leaving my system Friday, the following day: fever of 101.6, acute nausea.  Took Tylenol every 4 hours which did help. Saturday, felt much better but had sweating most of the day.  The sweating subsided at night Sunday morning, still sweating.  I also had weird vivid dreams since taking the vaccine.  Could be unrelated but I usually don&#39;t have dreams like that

                                                Everything was fine at time of shot which was at 11:45. I had no effects, I left clinic  around 12: 30 that afternoon, and went to do a job. I headed home around 4 pm and started to feel warm, but thought it was the sun. Around 5:15 I got the chills, very bad. So bad my jaws were shaking. I tried to use a heating blanket to get warm, but was very miserable. About an hour later I started running a fever that kept going up. My ears started to hurt and the ringing was really bad. By 8:30 my fever had spiked to 102 and I was so nauseous I had a hard time moving around, I almost used the bathroom on myself twice. Started burning up but still unable to move, I went outside to cool down and had a family member take me to the urgent care. They said my arm was swollen from the injection site and that everything was normal and that it was a good thing I was having these experiences because it means the vaccine was working.  Gave me nausea medicine and aspirin and sent me home. I was unable to sleep from all the pain in my body and just laid here in pain starting to get really hot. Woke up around 4 soaking wet where I broke the fever and then continued to have a mild fever all day Sunday, April 11, with mild sweats on and off when my body would get too hot. Today just been trying to move around but very tired and exhausted. Had hard time sitting up to do some work at the table, so been laying down most of the day.

Within an hour the right side of my face and ear started to hurt, almost like it felt burnt, The nerve endings was super sensitive and has still not gone away. That night I didn&#39;t feel good, tired and out of it. On the third day I woke up with a rash on various parts of my body and moved to my eye lids as well. I called for a telehealth, and asked for a low dose steroid and he said not because I would &#34;disrupt my immune response&#34;.  I&#39;m still having issues.

Those symptoms persisted for around 14 hours, and then the fever began to go down, and i began to feel slightly better.  I was very sick and extremely fatigued sleeping all day for about the next 48 hours.    I had no appetite for several days.  Overall I felt very sick like I had a very bad flu.

Unable to fall back to sleep I continued to lie in down. Around 8 hours later, it had slowed down a lot. This is when I checked my pulse with our machine  and it registered at 126 while resting. It was already much slower than during the night which I would guess the range to be 150-160.  In hindsight, I probably should have gone to the emergency but I was very tired and running a low grade temperature.

                                                Less than 12 hours after the vaccination I woke up at 1 a.m. with severe chills and body aches, a 102 fever and terrible headache.  The worst of this lasted 5 or 6 hours and slowly improved, although I could not get back to sleep. I was out of commission for the entire day.   At 6 p.m that evening my temperature was still at 100 degrees and the headache remained.  The following day, April 8th, I did feel better. I was still fatigued and only then did I notice any pain/sensitivity at the injection site (I think the body aches masked anything less severe). This pain was to be expected and nothing out of the ordinary. I am fine now. I was taken aback at the severity of the adverse reaction.  Also, my 20-year-old son got the shot at the same place -- with the same Lot Number 043A21A -- and had exactly the same reactions as I did. (They even started one hour after mine -- the same amount of time our injections were spaced out).    (He may not be reporting it.  Being only 20, he&#39;s not as thorough with these things although I will try to get him to do so).

                                                Lady had vaccine, was told it was Janssen but lot # is Moderna.  She got the vaccine, the night of the vaccine around 5:30 she got a raging headache (she does get reactions to most vaccines).  She took Tylenol and her arm did hurt.  The next day she was still really hurting, her headache was really, really bad, and it stayed until Sunday.  Then on Sunday she was ok.  On Monday when she went to work and her right arm went limp, and while she was walking her right leg gave way and almost fell, grabbed hold and steadied herself.  The raging headache/migraine came back and she started getting nauseous, her lower back hurt, her upper neck area hurt like somebody was pounding her neck.  Then she got diarrhea and really really tired on Monday and Tuesday and also had loss of appetite.  Then yesterday 4/13/201 she just had the headache and a sound in her ear, went to UC and got drops for it.  Her temperature was 96.5, and her normal is 98.7, and was told that she was really cold.  Her PB was really high and the doctor took it again but it was not as high, attributed it to anxiety.  Last night the lower abdomen pain started, feeling like she was getting her period which she has not had in over a year.  She saw a little blood on her panty liner, and was thinking she was going to have a period, but the pain is excruciating in her lower abdomen.   She has also taken Tylenol off and on for her symptoms, and feels like she is cramping.     She is having hot/cold flashes as well, and has not had these issues from menopause.

These symptoms lasted without break for approximately 4 days/nights at which it tapered off.  Also, on the morning of Sunday 4/11/21 I  noticed a vein that seemed to &#39;inflate&#39; on my Left upper forehead and pulsed for a few minutes and then subsided with the feeling of a slight headache mostly on the Left side.

                                                Day of vaccine:  within a few hours of receiving the vaccine (around 12:00pm or 1:00pm), I developed a headache, body aches, pain at the injection site, and brain fog.  The brain fog was such that I could no longer work, so I laid down.  Late in the afternoon (around 4:00pm), I developed numbness and tingling in my finder tips.  This continued to get worse, particularly when walking around, so I continued to rest.  Around 9:00pm, I was also getting dizzy when walking.  I went to bed, and awoke symptom-free in the morning.  Treatment included bed rest, ibuprofen, applied heat, and increased fluid intake.  Day after vaccine: I had the first HSV-2 outbreak I&#39;ve had in 5 years.

                                                About ten days after the vaccine, I started to have headaches, dizziness and nausea. My anxiety level is up and I have had a feeling of crawling in my back. The headaches last all day and they are like a tight band headache. They were coming back daily. Tylenol helps relieve the pain.  The nausea and dizziness lasted about one week. After four weeks I am still getting the headaches, but they are less frequent this week. The feeling of crawling in my back started after three weeks and it is still happening two or three times a day. I have seen a Neurologist.

                                                The day after I received the vaccin I experienced an extreme tension in my two eyes that I still have now but not as intense. My left eye is the most affected - The blood flows really fast in the eye and it is pulsing. I don&#39;t have the sensation every day now but still on and off. Both of my eyes feel tension not as much as it was at the beginning but still experiencing symptoms of pressure and pulsions. It feels like I am going to have an ophthalmic migraine. My eyes doesn&#39;t feel right either. Overall, I felt weak, highlighted and it felt like if I was experiencing  feeling of &#34;dissociation&#34; - caused I think by my sight being affected.  I couldn&#39;t do a lot as my energy was very low and it felt that my oxygen wasn&#39;t at its maximum. Every small activity required a lot of energy and I could barely walk around my block. It affected my work and I couldn&#39;t teach at the end of that first week. I wasn&#39;t feeling good. I went to my doctor on Monday, April 12th as I was concerned about blood clot or other neurological and pulmonary issues. My Doctor examined me and listened to me and concluded that the sides effects were taking longer than the average to go away. The following day I woke up reading about the blood clots due to J&amp;J vaccin. I called back my doctor and we did a blood test. It came back negative and I got my eyes checked by my ophthalmologist too, and he didn&#39;t see anything.

But not only did I experience it, but I&#39;ve heard from others that they have as well.)

                                                Sunday April 11 at about 11pm I started feeling extremely drained of energy and was experiencing some mild abdominal pain. I went to bed shortly after. Was woken at approximately 5am with severe abdominal pain, and extreme back pain in my left kidney. Kidney area was worse than abdominal pain but both were severe. I have had kidney stones in the past, the pain of this was way worse. Was unable to take a bowel movement. Suffered thru with pain increasing until unspecified date at around 2 am I drove myself to unspecified hospital. Was admitted to emergency room and given an in mild pain meds and anti nausea meds. Was given a ct scan of kidney, then a second  ct scan with contrast, as well as blood test. After awhile they came back to re draw blood because they said my blood had clotted and they were unable to use it. I was released after 5 hours with no prescriptions or knowing what or why I was in so much pain.  Pain lasted until unspecified date

                                                This is my second report (same vaccine Johnson and Johnson on March 23 lot #1805031) because my symptoms are still present; my first report was on 04/07/2021. I currently have depression, tinnitus, fatigue, brain fog, sometimes I feel shaky on the inside, swaying at times, and dizziness/vertigo. I sent follow-up information for my first VAERS report via mail and a pdf document to VAERS webpage; I attempted to fax several times but it came back unsuccessful; I left a message for a representative to return my call and nobody called back. I want to make sure you get this information, hence this second report.  Additional Follow-up Information: Hospital Emergency Room visit on April 8, 2021: purple finger, racing heart, chest pain. EKG, body scan for blood clots, and blood panel.  Doctor video visit on April 16, 2021: chest pain, feeling horrible, shortness of breath, metallic taste in the mouth, tinnitus, insomnia, anxiety, and depression.  Doctor office visit on April 29, 2021: headache, dizziness, fatigue, brain fog, stress, depression, thirsty, pressure at temples and back of head and forehead, rocking, anxiety.

                                                On the 7th, I woke up with flu-like symptoms. Arm was sore. I was fuzzy headed/loopy and general flu-like symptoms. Lasted one day and it was gone. 2nd event, I felt fine until two weeks or so later. I started having severe abdominal pain - it felt like diverticulitis. I went to my doctor and she ordered a CT scan to be done. I have had diverticulitis in the past. They treated my  newly diagnosed (Dx&#39;d on 3/19/2021)  diverticulitis with antibiotics and diet. That helped with my symptoms.

Then yesterday  morning was a little achy and by afternoon was miserable the next day she got really tired, joints hurting and had to take a nap.  She cancelled one of her appointments  she&#39;s a home health nurse and went to sleep and when she woke up her throat was swollen, hurting, labored swallowing and when she would drink her ears would pop, and her tongue was swollen but could breathe fine, and then it progressed to where she could not swallow at all.  She took two Benadryl&#39;s and went to rest, and she was not able to move and had to have help getting dressed.   Her joints are swollen, her hands are swollen, but her throat is not hurting like she was yesterday.

I finally got the water and 800mg of ibuprofen went back to bed and slept until 11am, got up no headache but since then I have been experiencing hot flashes daily the rest of March and into April a few in May. I realize that I am of the age to experience hot flashes heading into menopause but this was to coincidental and I had never had hot flashes before.

Did not sleep well much Friday night due to these symptoms.  Sudden pain in left side of my head about 40 min after the vaccine after I walked to the car and sat down after the 30 min wait. Pain starts as a slow dull ache, increases rather sharply, then goes away quickly. Have this pain several times or so yesterday and today even after taking ibuprofen.   Also pain in my neck with what feels like stress headaches with ibuprofen relieving it.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  Approximately 7 hours after the shot, my body was in a continuous state of needing to stretch. It is like when you wake up in the morning and need to stretch - a whole body stretch- but this was continuous. Over and over and over, right after each other. It went on for many hours. Also, 40 hours after the shot, I noticed a body rash (it could have been there the previous day but I was in bed all day feeling horrible and didn&#39;t notice). I also have a rash on my sacrum area, and I could barely walk with the pain in my bones in that area. As the morning has progressed, I am feeling better in that area but it is still sore. It has been 40 hours after my vaccine and I am still not 100%. Aside from the horrible headache, chills and flu-like symptoms, these are the other side effects I thought need to be reported.

She went to sleep at 1130pm on the day she received her vaccine. At 4am the following morning, she woke up and her whole body was convulsing--the muscles in her arms and legs were shaking, her hands were balled into fists, and her jaw was clenched. She reported that her husband woke up and asked her if she was ok to which we was able to respond, but cannot remember what she said. She reports that her husband said the episode lasted 3-4 minutes, but that she felt like it lasted an hour. When the episode was over, she was spacey and confused. She did not get out of bed. 10 minutes later, a second episode occurred. This time her left arm and right leg began convulsing, but the rest of her body was unaffected. This episode lasted 2-3 minutes and then ended.

                                                The first few days I just felt a little sore. Three days after the injections, I came down with flu-like symptoms (achy, brain fog, headache, fatique, chills) This lasted for three days. I started to feel better for a day and then came down with upper respiratory symptoms (sore throat, fatique , stuffy nose, slight cough, brain fog, no energy, loss of appetite)  As of today over two weeks from injection, I&#39;m STILL feeling off.  Symptoms are like having a mild cold with no energy.

I did not sleep at all Monday night. 3/30/2021- felt fine until about 1:00pm when I noticed body aches.  It worsened from then until bedtime.  My hands, feet, and back hurt the worst.  I asked my husband to rub my back, and he gasped when I lifted my shirt.  My entire midback area was covered in a bright red, raised rash with blisters. I took Benadryl and applied betamethasone prescription cream (which I use for poison ivy or bug bites).  My hands also itched, so I used the cream on my hands as well. I was sweating profusely but freezing.  Took my temperature several times but it was never over 98.  I could not sleep well, awake for an hour, asleep for 5 minutes off and on all night. 3/31/2021- I notified my primary care physician of the allergic reaction via the patient portal.  His reply was to take Benadryl, which I was already doing every couple hours.  The itchy back rash remained and more blisters formed.  By the time I finished working, the redness was gone but the blisters remained.  Itching stopped.  Body aches were lessening. 4/1/2021- Rash completely gone, itching completely gone.  Feeling lethargic (possibly due to lack of sleep, but maybe from the vaccine).  One large blister (size of a quarter) and several smaller blisters remain. 4/2/2021- as of now, my left arm is still a bit sore when I raise it over my head.  Main concern is the huge blister that is still on my back.

                                                After about 7 minutes of getting the Janssen Covid-19 vaccines, patient husband said patient is not feeling well.  I attended to patient immediately.  She said she is not feeling well, and her eye was rolling (as if when she tried to look up and couldn&#39;t get their eye to remain open) a for about few seconds and then she her eye was open back to normal.  She was sweating on both hands and face were cold to the touch.  I got the manager from the store to help me lie patient flat on the floor&#39;s surface gently to prevent her from falling off the chair.    Based on this our adverse event protocol, patient exhibited similar symptoms to Syncope (paleness, sweating, coldness of extremities), so I patient is lying flat on the floor, feet elevated, and cold compression was apply on her arms and face.  Unfortunately, patient conditions was not improving as it seem but she was alert and able to breath (fast pace) the whole entire time the incident occurred where she answer all questions when we myself, then the paramedics asked her questions.  Paramedic arrived at scene within 10 minutes after individual got off the phone with 911.  They took her away around 9 am and said patient probably experience anxiety attack.

I went out to eat and had steak and when I returned home I noticed my tongue felt weird and was sitting on my teeth.  It took about 1 1/2 hours to go down but it did so I didn&#39;t end up going to the emergency room.   My tongue was soar for the next few days because it was like I had bit it on both sides where it went over my teeth.

Pain was through my left eye towards the back of my head down to my neck. Lasted for awhile.  Took Tylenol and was able to get rest about an hour later.  Woke up that morning pain was still there but it was bearable.  Two days later it happened again.  Awaken with excruciating pain.  Didn&#39;t think it was related to shot because it had been almost 3 weeks since I had shot.  On 04/15/21, it happened again.  Never had any issues with headaches.  Not only have I been having headaches, I&#39;ve been having pain in my legs, feeling lethargic, etc.

By the end of that week, I was feeling like a truck hit me. As of Monday April 5, I couldn&#39;t work. Dizziness and light headedness began. I want getting any better. Better vaccine I felt amazing, but I started to feel like death. I called my primary Dr first who ran bloodwork, then Dr took over from there.  The vaccine dumped my TSH levels fast, I had hit 30 and with having a total Thyroidectomy my levels need to be about 167 for me to feel my best. I&#39;ve been stable for quite some time. I have had a drop before in the past but never felt so lathargic and sick as I have this time. I&#39;m returning to work finally Monday May 3. It&#39;s been a long haul , getting better, and honestly I was scared to get the vaccine not knowing how my system would react due to having autoimmune diseases. I guess I found out the hard way.

I had all over body aches for two days but my hands still ache after tree weeks. I woke up in the morning an noticed a big bulging blue vein in my right eyelid right above the outer part of my eye. One week later my thumb started to throb and then a big bulging blue vein in my left thumb. It felt like it had been injured but it looked better within hours. I called my doctor and he advised that I go to the ER. I also had trouble with my head throbbing for a week after the shot.  My eye was painful and lasted a little over a week and my eyes were a little blurry. Both problems have resolved but I still have an ache in my hands after three and a half weeks. It is a deep bone ache which makes it difficult to work with my hands.

She was also dazed and shaking.  After vomiting, she was more lucid but still felt poorly. EMTs arrived on scene and took her blood pressure &amp; found that she was very hypotensive. Recommended that she be transported to hospital due to low BP.

Pain started in the lower back which persisted to all over my body with sever bone, joint and muscle pain.  A few hours later the chills broke, I vomited and became extremely hot so hot to where nothing I did would allow me to cool off.  I may of had a fever but I couldnt get up to check so I am unsure of that.  For the next week I was so tired I could hardly function.

It was more extreme than I normally experience. but my mood has returned to normal.

She said she thought the needle was still in the arm until she felt the bandaid go on and realized it wasn&#39;t. She said she felt nauseous, and slouched down in her seat. I went to get a trash can just in case she got sick and she immediately got out of the chair and said she needed to lie down on the floor. We placed her on the pharmacy floor and she said she was having a hard time breathing and her head &#34;felt funny and weird&#34;. I retrieved the EpiPen but she said she never had one and didn&#39;t want to get it yet. She was conscious the whole time and appeared to be hyperventilating so we never administered the Epipen. She said her fingers were tingly and requested we call the paramedics so we did. They arrived very timely and took over. They took her BP and it was fine. They asked if she wanted to go to the hospital and she said no. She stated she was starting to feel better, she could breath more easily. She  eventually was able to sit up and the paramedics got her to call her son to come pick her up and the paramedics walked her out of the store to meet him.

Also when I laid down for the night, I was accutely aware of my heartbeat, which according to my smartwatch was beating at a rate of 71.  The next morning, I still was experiencing chills, and felt achy/stiff/sore muscles - possibly from tensing up and  shivering all night.  Pain at the injection shot also started the morning after the shot.  By bedtime the day after the shot, the symptoms had eased up.  The next morning the symptoms were gone, except for a little residual injection site discomfort.

                                                Left upper arm, shoulder and neck became very achy. I began to experience chills without a fever around 8:00 pm. Around 11:00pm, I began to feel nauseous. I wasn&#39;t able to sleep, my heart was racing. By 3:30 am I had vomited at least 5 times. Throughout the day on Monday, I was still very cold, nauseous (without vomiting) and somewhat lightheaded. It is now Tuesday and my stomach is still upset. I have not contacted my physician at this time. I have been treating myself with ginger ale, Pepto Bismol, saltines and rest. I&#39;m not 100%, but feeling much better.

                                                Administered vaccine at 12:40pm Pt during administration of vaccine started to pull away but full dose was administered, pt was nervous about the needle. After instructing pt to sit in the post vaccine chair for 15 minutes I noticed visible distress at around 12:50pm. I rushed to her aid and asked her how she was feeling and she reported feeling dizzy. I then helped her out of her chair onto the floor to ensure she would not fall and hit her head - told her to lay supine. I then asked my technician to give me the bp monitor. I then checked her bp and it was below 80/60. I informed her this could be contributing to her dizziness and then asked for consent to help raise her bp. She consented and then I told her I would be lifting her legs in the air to raise her BP. I held her legs in the air for 10 minutes or so and then reassessed her BP and it was 110/48. She started to feel better but reported feeling as if ants were all over her left arm which is where I gave her the vaccine. I assessed once again for angioedema, anaphylaxis, hives, redness, swelling, but didnt see anything. Since the pt was dizzy I did not offer her benadryl liquid but instead offered clairitin. The pt was merely having a panic attack post immunization and said she could swallow tablets and was feeling better. I gave her one clairitn tablet otc. She wanted to sit up so I assisted her to a sitting position while she was on the floor. She sat there for additional ten minutes then moved into a chair and was brought food by her husband because he said she did not have breakfast and thought that could be why she was dizzy. She was not a diabetic so I was not concerned about her BG. She said that this never happened in the past when I reviewed her PCQF form prior to giving her the vaccine. She has had zero history of syncope so this was rare for her. After an additional 10 minutes she had a bp reading of 98/60 and left the store feeling much better

Had severe headache from the left ear to the right ear and going up around my forehead, as if my head was in a vise - all day. Heart was racing all day and night, couldn&#39;t sleep on my side because of it. around 24 hours after the shot I felt chest heaviness, which went away after a few minutes. Face was flushed, and I felt clammy. Went to the bathroom more than normal.  Aches  and joint pain, which weren&#39;t too bad. When I woke up the next day, symptoms were gone, except my arm was still sore and had slight fatigue.

I would like to add that the side effects seem to have targeted areas that were hurting/ailments prior to the vaccine. 1. Headache 2. Fever 101.4 throughout the night 3. Flu like symptoms (felt like I was hit by a truck) 4. Shot was in left arm, however, no real pain. I have trigger finger in my left thumb that was going away, however, the pain intensified through the night. 5. I have Tennis Elbow and Trigger finger in my right thumb that was also starting to go away, but during the night, the pain was intense. 6. I have cuts on the bottom of my feet. During the night, my feet were on fire! I was having to cool them periodically. 7. Massive strange dream.

Had very difficult time keeping Tylenol down.  Was able to get up and use bathroom with assistance.  Worsts headache I have ever had.  Tylenol didn?t help much. All I could do was try to sleep and not move for fear of throwing up and worsening headache.   Will not take this vaccine again as this was a terrible experience.

                                                I received the shot on a Friday on my lunch hour and had arm pain for about an hour.  That night started developing some tiredness and body aches and a slight fever.  Saturday I could not get out of bed.  Chills, muscle aches and fever, ran a fever so high 104 plus I was delirious and could not get warm.  Sunday fever was down to 101.  Monday had a full blown head cold that lasted for 24 hrs.  About 2 weeks later I developed this right ear ringing.  It never stops and it is getting louder.  24 hours a day.

As the night progressed I started having chills and the headache gotten worse.  I took a ibuprofen and went to bed. In the morning I woke up feeling very weak with excruciating pain in my joints and muscles and a chronic headache. I could not move around without holding on because I was disoriented. This went on until the  second day I woke up without the pain but still feeling weak in my legs and entire body.

                                                The day after the vaccine (Sunday, 3/21/21), I had severe leg pain--throbbing in both legs.  My legs felt warm to the touch.   I also had a severe headache all day and a feeling of disorientation like I couldn&#39;t focus or concentrate.  I felt light-headed and very tired.  There was swelling, redness, and pain at the injection site (my left arm) all the way down the left side of my body (under my arm and around my ribs).  I took Acetaminophen, but the pain persisted all day.  The pain in my legs was the worst symptom and it was so painful and uncomfortable that it was impossible to sleep that night.  I&#39;ve never felt anything like it. I was planning to go to an emergency clinic the next day if the pain continued.  I finally got to sleep in the morning  (Monday, 3/22/21) and slept for several hours.  When I woke up later that day (3/22/21), the pain was gone and I felt normal again.   I was still tired for the rest of the week and I continued to have swelling in my arm at the injection site, but otherwise, no other symptoms.  It took approximately 6 days for the pain and swelling in my arm to feel better.  I did not seek medical attention because the leg pain was gone within 24 hours, but I am concerned now and am wondering if there has been any permanent damage to my circulatory system or heart.  I have noticed that my pulse has been elevated for the last 3 weeks (as compared to normal).

                                                Immediate reaction in right arm-it felt like my arm was on fire. The pharmacist gave the shot extremely high-almost in the shoulder and the reaction was intensely painful.   Starting about 6 days later, the soreness of the shot developed into not being able to raise that arm at all without pain.  Now, a month later, the pain is worse and is waking me up at night. The injection site is not sore, but the arm itself is not functional without pain. About 2 weeks after the shot, I started having a fuzzy feeling in my head (not painful) and ears.  I am extremely sensitive to sound and feel almost dizzy at times. My speech has been slurred and words are not coming to me easily. I am extremely tired and feel foggy.

Woke at 12:20 am with high temperature, severe shakes, extreme weakness and inability to walk without assistance due to shaking and weakness. Had extreme body aches and full blown migraine. Was too weak to call for help. Had Advil in nightstand and took several to help. Called doctor in the morning and was advised to rotate Advil and Tylenol. Was too weak to get out of bed all next day (Friday) and half of Saturday. Also experienced tightness in chest to where I had to start taking Albuterol (haven&#39;t taken that in years). Bad side effects and extreme weakness and total loss of energy lasted 3 days.  Persistent headache and tightness in chest lasted up to 7 days.. Horrible experience. I felt like I was poisoned.

I kept getting more uncomfortable , colder and getting body shakes.  By 10:00 I could hardly walk to bed because of uncontrollable muscle shaking, jaw chattering, and was unable to get warm.  I took Advil then.  It took about an hour to stop shaking and warm up in bed with my husband.  I felt terrible for the next 2 1/2 days, just horrible, unable to function.  I slept a lot.

Then 5 days later something hit her and hit her bad.  She went to the ER and they gave her Bentyl, diarrhea medicine as she was vomiting, not eating anything, and they gave her some anti-vomiting medicine.  They sent her home and said she would feel better.  The diarrhea and vomiting stopped but she then started with a rash.  it&#39;s all over her hands, arms, back, itching, and taking Claritin for it.  it won&#39;t go away.  Her symptoms continued to worsen, and woke up one morning and had so much pain that she could not move or breath and her husband called an ambulance and they took her hospital and diagnosed with a blood clot.  She was in the hospital for 3 days and now discharged on Eliquis.  She has bruises all over her coming out and very upset that she is still feeling bad and doesn&#39;t know how the rash is going to go away.   She was also prescribed Oxycodone for pain and also Tessalon Perls to take for coughing.

                                                As I drove away after getting the vaccine, I had some very sharp pain in my stomach. It came back the next day but not since then. I woke up during the night with chills and a severe headache which lasted 36 hours. Ten to twelve days after the shot I had extreme fatigue and head pain. It was above my right ear almost to my temple and goes toward the top of my head which was  a very sharp pain that lingered. These head pains last hours at a time and feels like the veins in my head are aching. They were daily all day for two weeks but now they are more intermittent. Nothing I took helped with the pain. They are not like headaches. On 04/17/2021 I woke up during the night with a sharp pain in my head. I went to the ER and they did a MRI but they did not find anything. The sharp pains lasted the next two days. My doctor said that the shot had triggered Cranial Neuralgia. I may have to take some medication to calm the nerves down.  I still had the pain in my head today which is four weeks after the vaccine. I am also worried about the extreme fatigue which makes me feel like falling asleep at my desk.  Some days it is worse than others. I had Covid-19 in April of 2020 and had fatigue for six months.

I felt terrible and the shivering was uncontrollable. I took one 200 mg of ibuprofen at 9 or 10pm, and another one at 11pm. That seemed to help and I fell asleep. When I awoke in the morning, I had a pounding headache. The headache was debilitating and lasted all day. The headache subsided around 6 pm 10/11/21 after taking a 200 mg ibuprofen. All of the above is unlike anything I have ever experienced, even with a fever or flu. It was misery, and I am a good sport, I didn&#39;t expect to have any side effects. These events came on vicious and strong.

                                                I had awful nausea, loud ringing in the ears, I fainted.  The medics provided help, gave me oxygen.  I started having convulsions.   After some time I felt like the lower part of my face went numb and it took tremendous effort to move my lips to talk.  At that point, the medical called the ambulance and sent me to ER, where I was under supervision for some time. I was very weak and nauseated. After I was released, I was very weak could not keep the vertical position.  The next day I was very nauseated, with awful tinnitus, lightheadedness, and weakness. Staying vertical for more than 15 minutes brought fainting symptoms.  I was not able to get out of the house to work.  The next day the fainting symptoms disappeared, everything else continued. Too weak to go to work.  I started moving about only on the 4th day after the shot.  During this event, I did not have any fever or muscle ache, no virus0tyle symptoms.

                                                severe chills came on about 9 hours after dose received. Could not sleep, could not get warm, intense shivering. Minor headache and dull aches throughout the body. Had to climb under an electric blanket, comforter and then another blanket on top to get warm and comfortable. As i drifted in and out of sleep through to the morning, I noticed the chills and shivering dissapating and was able to get some sleep. Awake now, still feeling a headache and flu-like aches to the body. Moving very slow. Arm  not really sore at injection site as it was upon receipt of vaccination.

I was really sick for the next few days. I was tired, too. The reflux made me go to the doctor - a couple weeks after vaccine. Increased symptoms of it real bad. They increased my Omeprazole dose from 20-40 mg. I have loose stools. They added a nose spray as well.  I had had my allergy shots the same week as I had my vaccine.

I woke in the middle of the night in a crying fit because I thought I was going to die I felt soooo bad ! It was worse than any flu Id ever had! My joints hurt, my head wanted to explode , fever of 101.3 , breathing issues , exhaustion, thirsty...this lasted 2 to 3 days. Ive had a couple of days here in beginning of april til now of waking up feeling sick again. It doesnt last all day. Sometimes it just before bedtime. I guess I just feel a bit sick, but that could also be the cancer that ive had since july 2020 that hasnt been treated by a health care system I have?

                                                Upon injection, medication burned going into arm and lasted about 2 minutes.  I immediately started feeling odd over my entire body, I felt and looked flush,  felt clammy, muscle tightness,  started shaking, felt very nauseated, blood pressure went up and experienced slight swelling in hands.  This lasted 30-45 minutes.  My blood pressure, oxygen saturation level were being monitored.  I left office at around 12:00 pm feeling better.  I felt off the entire day.  At 6:00pm I started with chills, muscles aches and pains.  At 7:30pm I took a shower and went to bed very fatigued, muscles pain and cramping and chills. I took my daily meds of 125mg of Diamox, and 100 mg of Azathioprine.  At 11:30pm I woke up with a 104 fever, sweating, and a lot of muscle cramping in legs and feet.  My head felt like it was going to explode.  My cerebral fluid pressure was up and felt in head and down spin.  I did not rest well and found it difficult to get comfortable all night.  I took an 200 mg of ibuprofen at 12:00am and started to feel some relief.

                                                It started with just a pain in the arm - normal soreness from the injection  site and up the left side of my  neck - but then it spread to the whole upper part of my left arm. It was very , very painful. It wakes me up almost every single night because it hurts. The pain will radiate  - now the pain is more in my arm area and now it&#39;s radiating to my back on on the shoulder blade area on the left side - my  neck is a tiny bit sore right. The soreness in the arm is always consistent but the radiating pain moves around somewhat. I am wondering if they gave me the injection incorrectly.  It doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s  what the description of &#34;COVID ARM.&#34; I don&#39;t have any swelling or redness and I haven&#39;t ever.  I take Aleve every now and then. I called the doctor last week and she told me to wait a couple of weeks and watch it.

I was really hyper the night of the shot.  Only got (4) hours of sleep.  The symptoms continued for approx 24 hours.  I had shortness of breath at times which could be from my heartbeat flucuating or I had anxiety.  I am also very irritable.  No other reactions.  Other than that I feel back to normal after about 48&#43; hours.  Praying I don&#39;t have any heart damage or lunch damage from what was injected into my body.

After it not resolving within 5 minute, I went to the ER. Rate had gone down by arrival but EKG showed depressed ST waves.  By second EKG, two hours later., it looked normal.  I since have had bouts of a racing heart both during day and awaking from sleep.

Around 4:45 I began to have chills, and when I arrived home about 5:15 I was shivering and freezing and full of body aches.  During the night I developed a fever of 103.7, 103.5.  My husband woke me to help cool me down with cool cloths and water.  My fever went down to 102 by morning and I still had body aches but not as bad.  I was lethargic and mentally fuzzy for a few days.  I did not feel well until Wednesday, March 24, 2021.

I visited Dr. and he has ordered tests to check on my heart. I told him I was concerned about the &#34;pause&#34; and the reason for pause because I feel pretty miserable, and he added a CT test that will be done in two to three weeks. I do not know if he will report my symptoms as possibly vaccine related.

                                                next day extreme fatigue, fever lethargy.  Got better but never got energy back and had some body aches and trouble sleeping.  On Wed. March 25th an EXTREME headache began and I could find no relief with High doses of Tylenol or Ibuprophin or a mixture of both. It was my whole head. Stayed on the couch all day Saturday and Sunday  27th and 28th unable to move because of the pain and extreme fatigue.  Monday the 29th made myself go to work but was not able to function or get much relief.  On Tuesday the 30th went to see physician who said he thought it was Occipital Neuralgia and gave me prednisone and said use hot compresses. Told him I thought it was more due to other symptoms like hallucinations (shadows I would see) Mind not clear and made me worry about driving. Asked if the shot could be a possibility. He just said he couldn&#39;t rule it out.  The doctor also mentioned I felt very hot but never took my temperature. I Took the prednisone. Headache did start to clear on Wed the 31st in the evening but my neck seized up where I could no longer turn it to the left and was very painful. Also felt like my lymphnodes were swollen.  I called on call doctor and they prescribed a muscle relaxer.  I did not start to get better until Sunday April 11th. Experience a couple occular migranes as well during this,  Still experiencing some fatigue and almost to a fainting point in the mornings

I had about 2 more very sharp pain in my ear that evening, and feels like I have something trapped inside my ear.  I still feel as though something is still in my ear and my neck is very tight.  I have  had a headache since the injection, and started getting chills and fevers on April 8 and has continued.  I have been extremely tired since April 9....it is interfering with my work.  My stomach hurts and feel miserable.  I have not yet recovered.

                                                I received the vaccine 3/12 around 3:00 p.m.  On 3/13 around 4:00 a.m., I woke up with a sharp, localized pain in my right, lateral thigh area.  Within a 15 minute period of time the localized pain moved down my thigh, past my outer knee area, and to my calf.  After approximately 15 minutes the sharpness of the pain subsided.  As far as I know I have had no lasting side effects from this.  I have CRPS/RSD in that leg, specifically in that region, so at the time and with the fever I had, I didn&#39;t think too much of this.  REACTION AFTER VACCINE INJECTION:  As an aside, I had some unusual reactions to the vaccine immediately after the injections.  Within 5 minutes of getting the vaccine, I developed numbness in my lips, tongue, and palate and a &#39;lump&#39; in my throat that made it hard to swallow.  It took approximately 2 hours fpr these reactions to resolve.  I have had these reactions before when I accidentally ingested sugar substitutes.  Also, at approximately 15 minutes post injection, both my ears felt internal pressure (as if I had submerged in deep water) and I could not hear well.  I have never had this reaction before.  This took about 1 hour to resolve leaving me with a moderate headache for 3 days.

At that point, my bad symptoms started. I was up all night.  1. I had nausea and I threw up. I had body aches and no energy to move. 3. About an hour later, my heart started &#34;racing&#34; really bad. I felt like I was running a marathon, and I couldn&#39;t keep up with the pace. I could hardly catch up my breath.  4. Then, my right arm started tingling and feel heavy. I couldn&#39;t feel any of my &#34;fingers&#34; on my right hand.  5. My body kept going from extremely hot to extremely cold. I felt like my blood pressure was up and down. I had more nausea. I could barely move. 6. I threw up again and, eventualy, I slept.

                                                4/5/2021--Received Janssen vaccine.  Felt very hot during the day.   4/6/2021--Woke up with very bad headache and rash on the injected arm plus on my stomach.  Went for a walk and felt pain in my left calf and achilles tendon.  Went to work.  4/7/2021--Started my work day as a Personal Trainer/Fitness Instructor at 6am as usual.  Taught cycling classes and trained a few clients.  Went for walk.  Still had a headache.  When I got in my car to head home, my vision was super blurry and I felt very dizzy.  I ate an orange and peanuts and hydrated more.  I was not even sure I could drive home.  I got home told my family how I was feeling.  My husband noticed my eyes were very red and swollen.  I took a shower, drank a smoothie and ate a salad.  Used my aunt&#39;s BP cuff to check my BP and it was 148/99.  I have NEVER had HBP.    4/8/21--Woke up feeling disoriented as if the left side of my face, body were off--neurological stuff.  I went to reach for grapes in the refrigerator and could not grab them.  I felt like I have never felt before and ask my husband to drive me to the ER.  While at the waiting room at the ER, I felt chest tightness and pain and nauseous.  My BP was 153/111.  Again, I have never been diagnosed or been treated for hypertension.  They did EKG, lab tests, chest X-ray.  Once my BP came down, they sent me home.   This is before all the JJ Janssen vaccine &#34;news&#34; came out and the reasons it was paused.  I developed a very bad cough about two hours after I got home from the ER.  4/9/11--Made appointment with a brand new primary care doctor.  Saw her on Monday 4/12/2021 as recommended by ER.  I had never met her before.  She prescribed a very low dose of BP medication, which I did not take because the number one side-effect is dry-cough.  I was already coughing a lot, later on with blood.  4/11/2021--Still feeling pretty bad, I woke up to the news of the Janssen vaccine being paused.  Frankly, I felt relieved that I was not going crazy.  This truly has been one of the hardest things I have ever gone (and still am) going through.  I became concerned about the pain in the left calf and heel could be a clot.   Called primary care doctor.  Had ultrasound of legs and chest x-ray the following day   4/12/2021--Had persistent cough with blood.  Went to ER at 9pm.  Had EKG, blood work, CT without contrast of chest, covid test--negative.  Got home around 2am.  4/19/21--Followed up with primary care doctor who after explaining to her I am extremely fatigued, still blurry vision, dizzy, cough better but not gone, chest discomfort on the left side, she referred me to an ophtamologist and cardiologist.  My insurance and this poorly established referral system is very difficult to navigate.  Up to now I am still waiting for the referral and pre-aurhtorization to the opthtamologist.  (4/23/2021).  I want to say, I am pretty healthy. I have worked in fitness and wellness for over 30 years. I have never drank alcohol, smoked or done any drugs.  Prior to this no physician has told me I have HBP or any issues for which I have to be medicated.  I take zero medications.  Even when I had the bad headache from the vaccine I took nothing.  I have not worked in two weeks and had not driven until last saturday.  If I don&#39;t work, I don&#39;t get paid.   I pay for almost $600/month for my insurance in the marketplace.  This has been another stressor of this storm.  Getting providers to really listen and insurance companies to take situations like this seriously.   I could not drive at night.  This has been rough and I look forward to being myself soon.  This reaction felt like a heart attack/stroke with extreme fatigue, acid reflux, cough with some blood, muscular pain.  The rash and headaches were the least of my concerns.  I am not yet recovered from all of this.  I sure hope there is no permanent damage and that this too shall pass.  It is important to note that I have tried reporting this event several times to the VAERS website online.  I completed the 4-5 pages multiple times and it would not let me submit.  I also called the VAERS 1-800 number to report and they told me to go back to the online form.  I left several messages when I could not get it done online and to this date no one has called me back.  I called to report my adverse reaction and they told me they do not take that info.  I also called the health dept.  After several phone calls to them a nurse called me back but did not take a formal report.  When someone is feeling pretty sick, this is a lot to ask of.  I persisted because I feel this is important to be reported.

                                                immediate symptoms - bowel movements are very different and continue to this day. Like babies poop. Specific date of occurrence 3/24/2021 - 2 pm: was standing in my home office feeling just fine and then my heart started racing and I was immediately nauseous to the point I had to lay on the floor on my back and tell myself to breathe.  I felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest, so I got up and grabbed my wrist blood pressure monitor and went and lay back on the floor telling myself to breathe. I took the first reading and it said 200/52/57  so I too it again 199 / 50 / 58.  I started to panic and remembered I had bought some cans of oxygen for my father and had one in the bathroom. I went and breathed on that for about 2 minutes. My reading then went back down to a more normal range. Since that time my head doesn&#39;t feel the same and it scared me enough to tell my husband and mom, yet they both told me not to stress about it. I have only experienced ongoing bowel movements and the weird head feeling since that time but did contact my Dr. for an appointment. I want be certain I didn&#39;t have a stroke or something peculiar.   I had noticed my heart rate increasing but wasn&#39;t sure if I was imagining it, so I restarted taking my blood pressure numbers on 3/22. My blood pressure that morning at 6 am was 113/59/72.

                                                6 days after receiving the vaccination, my upper left arm muscles became quite painful.  Pain increased each day to the point of limiting arm range of motion, especially abduction and internal rotation.  Today is 4/25, I am still unable to internally rotate my arm, or reach behind myself due to the severity of the pain in the muscles.  Pain also prevents me from sleeping on my left side which is my natural sleep position.  I have tried OTC meds, stretching, hot/cold compresses and self massage none of which has worked to loosen up and reduce pain in my arm.   Although the level of pain is no longer increasing each day, it is not decreasing at all.

                                                My appointment was on time, 4pm on 4/3 at the Pharmacy.  The young girl that gave me the shot told me she was certified, and she gave me the shot in the presence of her manager.  I have given  myself shots for years with diabetes, plus many flu shots, and have never felt pain like that.  I expressed this to her, how painful it was, and she just said &#34;I know, I know...&#34; as if it was normal for the shot to be so painful. I knew instantly something was wrong.  They were more worried, it seemed, about a potential adverse reaction such as an allergy shock, since I&#39;m allergic to a few things, but I did not experience that.  I waited 15 minutes, my arm hurting the whole time, and they suggested I go buy Tylenol for the pain, which I did.  My left arm has hurt since then. I got a horrible bruise from this shot (will send picture) that took weeks to heal.  Since then I&#39;ve continued to feel pain and don&#39;t have full mobility of my left arm. I can type, but not lifting anything heavy and have to go easy with anything on the left side.  I thought at first it might be what people were calling &#34;covid arm&#34; but I discovered that was more about soreness, not pain.  I tried ibuprofin, but after three weeks I&#39;d had enough and made a doctors appointment.  Since I was also noticing my left shoulder was very tense and tight, and I was starting to get neck stiffness in same area, I started googling before my appointment.  When I entered my symptoms, SIRVA kept popping up, so I wondered if that was what I now had because of the improper vaccine administration.  I asked my doctor for an MRI order to find out, but she said we needed to do an Xray first (which only showed mild issues related to osteo).  She offered a prescription of taking Advil 400 mg three times and day and to use a muscle relaxer when I needed it, such as at night (Cyclobenzaprine).  She said to try that for a week, and if it wasn&#39;t better, that another Dr could order MRI.  Since then I&#39;ve also added a pain spot under my left shoulder blade. Insurance called and said the order was &#34;under review&#34; so that&#39;s where things stand now. If they don&#39;t approve, I guess I will go next to an orthopedist for guidance?  This has cost me health, due to lack of sleep also - I wake up with pain in the middle of the night, even when I take the meds. Praying for a diagnosis, and solution, soon.

I wasn&#39;t able to sleep or eat for almost 7 days. I was experiencing nerve pain and tremors. They weren&#39;t continuous, but they would come and go. Inside I felt like there were quivering muscle sensations and weakness. The pain that was associated with the nerve pain would not go away. I have started to experience severe anxiety. I feel like I&#39;m experiencing PTSD.

As time went on, the pain spread.  My entire stomach muscles tighten up (feels like I&#39;m recovering from abdominal surgery) and then spread to the rest of my body.  Couldn&#39;t move without feeling pain.   Fatigue =  I dozed off around 7 pm and slept like I was in a coma.  Woke up around 2 am and was very confused. Muscle Fatigue = March 9th - The pain has subsided considerably Muscle Fatigue - March 10th - Still just a little sore - Can&#39;t laugh or cough without feeling pain and my back is killing me

                                                The day I received the shot, my arm got warm and sore.  The soreness traveled to my shoulder and neck.  I got headachey, alternating between hot and cold chills, a little bit of nausea and extreme tiredness.   This continued for the next 5 days which seemed like they were considered mild reactions according to the CDC website.  Most concerning though, is on day 5, (3/14/21) in the evening as I was getting into bed, I started getting a red, extremely itchy rash on both my arms, my lower back and my upper legs, to the point that I could not sleep because it was so itchy and had to take Benedryl.  I have not changed anything in my diet or in the products I use on my body, so I can only attribute this reaction to this vaccine.  I am still a little itchy on my arms today 3/15/21.   I am also still getting the hot and cold chills and still have a little bit of nausea, not bad, but enough to be &#34;off&#34; certain foods.

I took Benadryl and itch is subsiding. I hope this is the end of side effects!

On Saturday 03-20-2021 when I woke up my right eye was also inflamed but only lasted one day. I have spasms to my calves with leg cramps. I can not sleep at night due to the inflammation.  I went to see my PCP this morning who prescribed a leg cream for the cramps, but I do not know the name. My blood pressure today in the morning was 154/96.  My doctor said it was a reaction to the vaccine.

Once the chills were gone, I got an intense headache around the back of my head and in my forehead between my eyebrows.  Difficulty sleeping through these symptoms. Woke up the next day and those symptoms were gone.   Fatigued the next day.  Took a two-hour nap Saturday afternoon and felt normal afterwards.

                                                The patient was screened and was found to have multiple medical allergies but no allergies to any of the components to the Janssen vaccine.  As a precaution, the nurses advised a 30 minute observation.  She received the vaccine without complication and then was being observed and they called me over and the paramedics were also with the patient.  About 17 minutes into observation, the patient started developing chest pressure (4/10), lightheadedness, and nausea.  No shortness of breath, stridor, diaphoresis, back pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, neurologic changes, and any signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis.  She was very anxious.  Further history revealed that the patient had been discharged from the hospital 6 week prior.  She initially went in for an abdominal laproscopic surgery and woke up to having 32 staples closing an abdominal incision.  They had to change from a laproscopic approach to an open abdomen approach due to complications.  She ended up with sepsis and a colostomy and was hospitalized for 2 weeks getting antibiotics.  She lives by herself and was overwhelmed before coming into the clinic for her vaccine.   The paramedics did a 12-lead ECG that showed sinus rhythm.  Vital signs and blood glucose were within normal limits.  The paramedics recommended that she go to the hospital to be checked out but she was very resistant and was tearful because she was traumatized from her previous hospitalization.  After some time, the paramedics convinced her to go to the hospital.  The paramedics hung around the emergency department and then came back once they found out that she was fine.

All night and through to the next morning I had a high fever, though I didn?t take my temperature. I was achy all over, had an incredibly horrific headache which strong migraine over the counter pills did not help,  I would go back and forth from shivering to sweating (my body would be drenched in sweat) and just feeling miserable. I slept off and on until about noon. Then all symptoms slowly went away. By about 2:00 I was up and around though tired. By early evening I was perfectly fine.

She stated that the facial symptoms started mid morning today on 4/5/21.  Last week ( week of 3/28 to 4/3) she reports that she felt &#34;weird&#34;.  She felt as if there were cool water running under her skin at all times.  She also states that when anything touches her skin, it feels very cold.  For example, when running her hands under warm water, it feels like ice water on her hands.  When setting her bare arms on her desk, it feels as if they are being set on ice and when her pants rub against her legs it feels as if they are wet and cold.  She also stated that the top 1/3 of her back was tingly and felt as if she had applied Biofreeze to it, but she had put nothing on her back.  Her tip of her tongue feels as if it is &#34;burnt&#34; and she can not tasted anything on the front part of her tongue.  She needs to get things way in the back of her mouth before she can taste them. On 4/3/21 she states that her lips began tingling as if they were having numbing medication wearing off from a dental visit, but she had done nothing different.  On 3/31 her lower back also felt as if it had a pinched nerve.  Today on 4/5/21 she has the Bell&#39;s Palsy on her face that started mid morning and she complains of her nose feeling tingly also.  She also feels as if she is retaining fluid.

Then I started running a fever. I was hot with chills and when I wasn?t under a blanket I was shaking uncontrollably. I took ibuprofen which helped a little. Ended up taking an Ativan to sleep. The next morning I felt like I had the flu. Still feverish with a deep cough. Groggy, lethargic and tired. Took a two hour nap around 4. Starting to feel better but I?m exhausted and very irritable.

                                                In the middle of the night of the 10th of April I started having what seemed like normal side effects---muscle aches, headache, fatigue.. and then all day on the 10th the same side effects.   Then last night I slept 9 straight hours but woke up  sweating a couple times in night and in morning woke up sweating but my aches and headache seemed better than the day before so I went downstairs to make tea.  After pouring a glass of orange juice and having a couple sips I started to feel strange --dizzy and oversome with a strange feeling that was not quite like the feeling before fainting -- my back had a weird pain and i was a little nauseous as well. ..it was more overwhelming -- more loss of control like a huge wave of dizziness and ringing.  I made my way to a couch to try to regain balance -- but was still very dizzy-- something happened to make me try to get up and go upstairs so I remember walking 12 feet or so then told myself to sit down.  Before that happened I must have blacked out.  I faintly remember moving myself across the floor but then must have blacked out again.  I woke up at the base of the stairwell and then was able to walk upstairs.    I had collapsed the first time onto a hard floor as my orange juice glass had spilled all over and when I got upstairs my sweatshirt was covered in juice.  I don&#39;t remember any of that.  Once upstairs I drank water and have been fine since then.  I had eaten dinner the night before but maybe it was the sweating in the night that dehydrated me and i cramped up and had a strange pain in my back---i don&#39;t know.  I am a very healthy 56 yr old woman 5&#39;3&#34; 105 lbs so maybe the Johnson and JOhnson one dose was a lot for my body or maybe my body was just doing what it&#39;s supposed to do to react to vaccine.... i also may have had asymptomatic covid in the last year so my body was overreacting.   This happened 7 hours ago and I seem fine aside from slight headache and continued weakness from vaccine but I thought I should report the incident in case there might be something more or in case others had similiar responses.

                                                FOR 3 WEEKS FOLLOWING THE VACCINATION:   I had aches in all of my joints (elbows, wrists, and knees).  I thought maybe i am developing arthritis.  This lasted for approx 3 weeks and then suddenly stopped. Was it joint inflammation?   I had no other symptoms.   I did not visit the doctor. Within 5 hours of the vaccination, symptoms started with pain in both of forearms.  Overnight I developed fever, lethargy , aches and pains.  Took Tylenol.  Slept for approx 36 hrs.  I felt much better after 40 hrs.   I was not concerned.  I would say my symptoms were moderate or worse. In March of 2020, I had shortness of breath in my left lung .  It lasted for days.  I was concerned but I did not visit the doctor.  It eventually went away.  Could I have had Covid then?  A sure possibility but I will never know!

Within the past week and a half, I feel a little tired and light headache. Sometimes, I had trouble sleeping at night.  But, starting end of the second week, the symptoms got worse. I am suffering from a sleep disorder. I felt exhausted, bigger and longer headaches, joint pain, muscle pain. My Blood pressure went up. I visited my family doctor today.

                                                Five days 18 hours after receiving the Janssen vaccine shot, I awoke with an unusual and very painful headache. Having only been asleep for about two hours, I didn&#39;t want to get up and tried to rearrange myself for relief. Getting slight relief, I did fall asleep again after moving around and drinking water over about an hour. I awoke two hours later (about 10:00 AM) with almost unbearable head pain throughout my head, not localized to one area. I drove to fast food restaurant, having a difficult time driving due to pain, and got a half-sweet tea. Tea, having caffeine and some sugar, can often relieve a headache. It didn&#39;t offer the relief I expected and about 30 minutes later, I vomited up the tea. I was at that same time ordering a sandwich and detox smoothie, thinking the detox smoothie may help. It seemed to after a couple more hours, but I continued to feel like the headache was still barely there and waiting to return. I ate very well and clean all day, but even late in the evening, I cod feel remnants of a headache. The next morning, 4/12, I awoke again with that same horrible headache, but maybe just slightly less excruciating than the day before. I did not vomit. After a few hours of eating, drinking water, and taking aspirin with Tylenol, the headache subsided.

I felt a weird sensation near my heart that was only momentarily - like a bubble or something about 1/4 inch in length move through a vein near my heart - I think I felt it again near my stomach a few days later - weird.  and then my face felt like I was losing sensation - like it was tingling .  that lasted a little longer, like a sagging.  I thought maybe I put on weight.  i was concerned and went to pharmacy to get my blood pressure taken - which I have never done in my life.  I am 56!  They no longer do that bc of COVID - so I asked a nurse friend to take it. She measured 124 over 60 something.  that is high for me.  I am typically 106/62.  I checked my records.  I started running then - in case I have put on weight.  I am 155 (high).  But now I started getting a constant headache about a week ago.  I am in a new job - so have thought it was due to stress or I reactivated a concussion  headache.   i started taking  Ecotrim 2 everyday now.  I am NOT an aspirin taker and I do not get headaches.  I try not to take ibuprofen for the headache.  I am not sleeping.  I have slept well ALL my life up to now.  I go to bed late now like 11;30 and I don&#39;t sleep.  I have a lot on my mind.  so it could be that.  Under a lot of stress.  this just started the last week.  A very new pattern.  I started a new job 3/15/21.  I was drinking coffee for the first 2 -3 weeks and now am not drinking it.  I don&#39;t drink much alcohol but I have had 1 glass of wine on the weekend or beer.   I run about 3 miles 2-3 times a week.

If I did anything (shower or carry a simple laundry basket) my arms would hurt so bad, I was out of breath and my heart was pounding so hard.  By the week of March 29th - I was laying down in the middle of the day, no energy at all.  Called the doctor and because of the shortness of breath &amp; Body aches, they would only schedule a video visit for Monday, April 5th.  After talking to me, they schedule to see me that day at 11:45 AM.  I had weak muscle response in my arms, pale, and out of breath.  They did blood work.  Two hours after getting home; they called and said I needed to get to the emergency room.  My red blood cell count was dangerously low, and they ordered a blood transfusion.  I sent 6 days in the hospital.

                                                At the time of the vaccine, I felt fine, soreness at the injection site but nothing. For days later, I began to feel, ill all over and could not get out of bed.  I had severe abdominal pain, aches and pains all over my body.  Particularly in places where I had pre existing conditions.  As the day progressed, I continued to have severe GI issues, could not eat (pain like food was stuck) heart burn, constipation (clamy like flu).  Shortness of breath, I could not walk far.  I took 3 trips to the ER where they treated for the abdominal spasms, UTI, and pain.  By the end of the week I had a slight fever.  I tested negative for COVID during that time.  For two weeks I was unable to eat, get out of bed.  I had several petite mal seizures.  If felt like my body was fighting the vaccine and the vaccine was attaching all of me weak or any preexisting conditions.  Eventually, after 3.5 weeks I was able to sit up, and walk. I still have shortness of breath, some fogginess,  Muscle strain, walking with a cane and a lump at the injection site.

                                                At approximately 2AM on Thursday, a severe headache (I would term a migraine based on prior experience) woke me. I had no apparent fever, but my body was stiff and I felt my heart rate was elevated. I drank some water, in case it was dehydration-related, but was unable to fall back asleep. I also experienced some nausea at breakfast but ate toast and had some (caffeinated) tea about 6 AM. Around 7 AM I took two (2) ibuprofen, which dulled the headache slightly. However it persisted into early/late afternoon hours on Thursday. (My customary activities were curtailed somewhat.) Since I have had migraines in the past, I treated this as I treated those: hydrating, taking pain medication as required, remaining quiet, reducing exposure to light and sound, etc. I continued taking two (2) ibuprofen periodically as I felt the need through bedtime Thursday night.  Friday I had periodic headaches (again, attributed them to rebound migraines or just headaches), felt tired, and been a bit &#39;out of it&#39;. But my systems did not prevent me from functioning. I did repeat the two (2) ibuprofen on Friday night at bedtime.

                                                Follow up report to first VAERS report (1248256) - Entire (all over) breast tenderness (the nipple tenderness has been there since within a couple day after the vaccine - and that hasn&#39;t gone away). Dr said I&#39;m having an inflammatory response to vaccine and they have referred me to a rheumatologist (gave me a referral) - joint pain and itching hasn&#39;t gone away at all. (The really bad rash on my neck, upper chest and torso and back on day three - that rash is gone but that tingling and itching of having the rash hasn&#39;t  gone away.) I&#39;m working still but I&#39;m working from home - so that has been okay - although some days I feel worse then others.  I noticed yesterday that my breasts were swollen/lumpiness. Was born with fiber cystic breasts - since menopause that has gotten better but now this feels like it did back then - feels like it did when I was going to start my period. I haven&#39;t had a period since five years ago. Eye sensitivity: Normally have dry eyes but it&#39;s worsened. I have to put drops in multiple times of day. I literally wake up in the middle of the night with almost a sandpaper feeling in my eyes and have to put drops on them. I have been doing acupuncture - it will be my third time today - it helps with stress and the anxiety from these symptoms.  They wanted me to take steroids - I&#39;m trying not to do something like this because I am so sensitive to these types of things.

                                                I experienced body aches, headache, anxiety in my chest (once), tiredness.  One other thing that happened that may not be related is that my secondary implant eye socket became very sore and swelled up.  It could of been for another reason but the timing was uncanny.  I am feeling fine now and none of my reactions were that troubling.  I have experienced about 3 times a sudden feeling in my  body that made me think I wonder if that was the vaccine but I am feeling great now and all is good.  Thank you so very much for all the research and production of these life saving vaccines.

After 4 hours the fever subsided as quickly as it came on and my heart returned to normal functioning. When the fever subsided I was left with a severe headache for approximately 6 hours. Once the headache subsided I felt lethargic and foggy headed. On the second night (3/14/2021) the fever returned but was only 100.4 degrees. I took an Aleve before going to bed and when I woke up this morning I felt back to normal.

                                                At about 23 minutes broke out in a cold sweat. At 26 minutes, became hoarse (always my first symptom of anaphylaxis). Progressed to coughing and feeling a lump in my throat and then tightness in my chest. My blood pressure elevated to 152/100. At that point I self administered epi pen and paramedics called 911. This provided relief but after about 5 to 10 minutes the tightness in my chest and the feeling I couldn?t get a deep breath began to return and the paramedics administered two puffs of an albuteral inhaler and transported me to the hospital. At the ER, they did an EKG, started an IV and administered fluids, prednisone and Benadryl. I was discharged about 90 -120 minutes later with a prescription for 3 days of prednisone (50mg) and instructions to continue to take 25 mg oral Benadryl every 4 hours.  The next morning my face and chest were red and looked like I was sunburned. My face was also swollen.

                                                I got the shot in my left arm and shortly after right above my right eye I could feel a reaction going on. Almost like something effected the muscle, I didn&#39;t say anything and went to the wait room I mentioned it before I left and they said it sounded like a migraine and I went home.  When I raise my face on the right side of my eyebrow area feels like I have spasms. When I got home it moved to my cheek area as well and felt strange.  I got a rash on my right cheek that evening and a super bad headache. I took a Benadryl and went to sleep. I didn&#39;t have a fever.  By the morning the rash was gone, the only thing that bothered me was my eyebrow area ( muscle area) I went to the Dr the following day and she said it sounded like it was my sinuses. Prior to this I was having allergy / sinus issues.

                                                Received injection on Sunday. Monday was nauseated and had chest pressure.  Nausea and CP came in waves and occurred about 10 times. Then stopped.   Felt &#34;off&#34; for 4 days.  Felt fine on Friday and through Wed 3/23/21 until 9:10 PM.  Developed visual changes in left peripheral bilat.  Appeared like waves in an arc.  Then began to not be able to breathe.  I had to tell myself to breathe.  Called squad, arrived 9:45pm.  BP 170/110, HR 118. By 10pm, the visual changes disappeared BUT developed chest pressure in same area as the MOnday after the vaccine.  Then became extremely nauseated, almost vomiting.  Nause came in waves for next 6 hours until it calmed down.  Then returned Wed am for several hours, again in waves along with hollow chest feeling and pain. Continued with headache off and on with brain fog the remainder of Wednseday 3/23/21.  Discussed with hospitalist at Hospital and was told to report it to the CDC as likely an adverse effect to the vaccine.  Was still in the 14 day window.     Thank you,  RN, PhD, MSN, MS, BSN

It wasn&#39;t like a sudden cramp that just went away after a few minutes. Nothing I did seemed to help, walking around, stretching,.  It got progressively worse.  This started around 9 pm.  I took three (200 mg) ibuprofen at about 10:30  p.m.. That didn&#39;t help much, unable to lay down and sleep,  too uncomfortable in any position. . Finally around midnight I took a muscle relaxant, and that  worked. When I woke up this morning, I felt fine.  No muscle pain or aches.

                                                Difficulty taking deep breaths, dizziness that felt more like vertigo (the floor and ceiling spinning whenever I stood or sat up), exhausted to the point that I could not sit up without falling asleep.  I slept 14hrs straight for two days after the shot.  Tired after walking down the driveway and back.  Entire body aching with excruciating pain but not the left arm where the shot was taken.  Headaches were bad as well.  No appetite.  The 3rd day afterwards I felt better but still very tired.  The 4th day still tired but better.  Tylenol, caffeinated coffee and lots of water seem to help me get through this.  The fifth day afterward, I am almost 100%  but dealing with running nose and eyes which may not be related to the shot.

After about 5-6 minutes in the car, I started to feel bad, and I felt I should pull over.  I was on the road and traffic was super busy. I did pass out in front of a store on the road while driving my car. I came too and saw a restaurant. I pulled into their parking lot and texted my husband to come and get me. When he got there, I could barely stand. I layed down in the back of his truck because I could not sit up. My arm went number but I could wiggle my fingers.  We did drive to the hospital because I was so weak. but after the 15 minute drive to get to the hospital, I was able to sit up and walk again. I did not want to pay the $500 deductible so I my husband drove me home where I am sitting on the couch resting now.  My husband is a Chiropractor, so he has a lot of medical background.

Patients breathing was fine, but she was extremely lethargic/limp. Was coherent but slow to answer questions, excessively sweating and pale, small amount of vomit. At one point, patient said that she did not know where she was. Said that her fingers felt numb and tingly (could not pick up water or orange juice...we had to put water and juice to her lips to drink). She said that she needed to lay down. Per patient she had oatmeal with very little sugar for breakfast and coffee. Believe the reaction was a vasovagal response.

                                                Started having a headache on Tuesday afternoon, took migraine pill (excedrin) with minimal improvement.  Went out to dinner later that night and couldn&#39;t finish dinner d/t HA.  Describes head pressure, pain, and pounding sensation.  On Wednesday worked from home, felt like she was in a fog and continued to have pain/pressure in the back of her head.  Pt took a nasal decongestant which pt is unsure if made any better.  Thursday continued to have headache but improved compared to Tuesday and Wednesday.    Had taken benadryl at school which was somewhat helpful.  Saw PCP today via telemedicine visit. PCP prescribed steroid; had not started taking this because started feeling worse and came into the ED for this.     Earlier today, had worsened HA and felt like she was going to pass out (did not pass out).  She felt like her left hand was numb/pins/needles as her son was taking her BP; lasted for a few minutes.  Later, her right hand started feeling numb/pins/needles and had difficulty picking up objects.   57-year-old female  presented with a headache and found to have a subdural hematoma of unknown etiology.   Neurosurgery was consulted.   Patient was initiated on Keppra 500 mg b.i.d. for seizure prophylaxis. Serial CT scans were done  Which showed stable subdural hemorrhage.  Blood pressure was monitored during her stay but did not require any as needed medication.  Further imaging including MRI and MRV were performed to assess for aneurysm or venous malformation however nothing was seen.  Bleeding disorder workup was not performed. Neurology was consulted.  EEG was ordered to assess for seizure activity however this was negative.

Prior to vaccine, I was energetic and worked out vigorously every day for 60 min (20 mile bike ride and weight lifting).  Typical muscle sored prior to vaccine was a day or 2 after increasing weights.  Now, I can only work out 2 days a week.  Muscles ache constantly and I cannot sleep because of the pain.  Ibuprofen only helps a little.  Prior to the vaccine I slept 7-8 hours a night.  Since the vaccine, I am sleeping 10 hours and am still tired.

                                                I tracked my symptoms in a notebook because they were so severe on Day 1. Day 1-3: sore arm, headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, foggy brain, unable to focus, chills/uncontrollable shaking for several hours, body aches. Day 4: Same symptoms as above but milder. Bleeding gums when brushing teeth on left side of mouth (this NEVER happens). Painful gums (does happen when very sick with a virus). Day 5-6: Feeling better, but tired. Day 7: Tired, headache, nausea following exercise. Day 8-12: Mild feeling of discomfort while peeing. Tired every day.  A bitt foggy every day but this happens with pollen season. Day 18: tired, trouble breathing on treadmill- I attributed this to pollen as it went away the next day when I closed the window. Day 20 (May 1): While out with friends, after having lunch and a glass of wine, I jumbled a few words and could not say them correctly. There were just about two words in two sentences. I tried a few times and they kept coming out wrong. It was nothing I have ever experienced before. We laughed it off but I felt very unsettled and a bit concerned about driving home. I drove home and was fine. I remain tired and feeling foggy which could be  due to pollen. I have scheduled an appointment with a clinician today and hope to have some blood work done.

                                                My issues initially started about an hour after the vaccine.  I became very subdued, no appetite and &#34;foggy&#34; for a lack of better words.  I attributed this to what others stated were &#34;typical reactions&#34; and did not make a fuss over it.   The following day I was VERY tired and stayed in bed and then about half way thru day 3, I became alert and resumed normal activity.  At day 13 I began to have upper thigh pain in my left leg and began to feel winded as I was would walk up steps and do housework which had not happened previously ever..  On 4/14/21 I requested an appointment with my primary care doctor, however he was booked for 2 weeks and I was referred to an associated PA  where I received a virtual consult.  He told me that I was &#34;over the age&#34; of the women that were having reactions ,even though I had requested a Doppler.  He only ran bloodwork, and in fact never even called me back on the bloodwork, and just posted it in the online profile.  My ankles are VERY swollen and have bluish pitting and my feet do have considerable pain.  I do have right side abdominal pain everyday since the 13th of April.  I now need to find a doctor that will run diagnostics and respect my concerns

I was taken to the ER and kept there approx. 5 hours.  I was extremely weak, could not lift my head and had trouble forming thoughts and words.  They gave me medication via IV&#39;s and observed me.  I started to feel better after about 4 hours after the vaccine, but have had more headaches than usual after receiving it.  I still have some issues with being upset and anxious about the reaction and if it will have long term adverse effects on me.  I will never get another vaccine of any type again.

                                                The most concerning was hallucinations.  I saw the tooth fairy and cried for santa.  I had a fever, chills so violent that I made the bed shake - lasted for hours; severe headache that triggered a migraine, exhaustion, and nausea.  It&#39;s 2 days later and I still feel terrible.  My husband gave me a tylenol PM that night and the next day as the headache was a full blown migraine, I took naratriptain.   I still have a slight headache but want to avoid taking additional medicine if possible.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine, I had stinging pain spreading like a wasp sting (to which I am allergic) traveling down my left arm. Within a half hour, sharp muscle cramps took place simultaneously on top of the &#34;wave&#34; of sting like pain. These waves of cramping pain changed in location, but were strongest in my arms and legs. Between these waves, sharp pinching nerve pain happens in specific spots which could be anywhere including scalp and between toes. I had one good day with little pain. Other days are not so bad if I keep ibuprofen consistently in my system. It has been 12 days, and these pains have lessened but not stopped.  The remaining pains are more of the sharp isolated nerve pains.  I have not had any flu like symptoms, and I&#39;ve had very little pain at the injection site.  I have not been able to work much of the 12 days since the shot. I worry that the nerve pain may not go away.

Today is the first day I felt returned to normal.

                                                I felt fine immediately after the injection - just a little pain in the arm where I got the injection and when raising my arm. By 6:30 pm I was achy all over and my legs were aching a lot. When I went to bed around 8:00, I hurt all over (achy and flu-like feeling, but no fever). I dozed off and on and about midnight when I woke up, I had a very rapid heartbeat. This went on all night and into the morning. It was hard to get any sleep at all. When I&#39;d get up to go to the bathroom, I was slightly dizzy and unsteady on my feet. After I got up at 6:30 am, the highest my heartrate got was 113, then it finally began going down. I was still hurting all over, felt extremely tired, and now had fever - 99.8. The fever lasted off and on all day and into the next night. I was also very nauseated all day and I felt extremely bloated. I also had a bad headache. When I woke up on Friday, my fever and the headache was gone, but I felt extremely tired and weak and still nauseated. I slept most of the day and I still ached all over, but not as much. My lymph nodes were also swollen. On Friday afternoon, I walked up to the mailbox and I was winded and unsteady. On Saturday, I felt a little better, but was still extremely tired. By Saturday night, all the aches, pains and headache were back and I didn&#39;t sleep well at all. I rested most of Sunday and felt a little better Sunday evening. The aches and pains were going away, but I was still very tired and exhausted. I felt the same way when I woke up on Monday morning. It seemed like the vaccination made the aches and pains I normally had with Fibromyalgia about three times as bad as usual. And I was still very bloated feeling all over. By Monday afternoon the nausea finally went away. By Monday afternoon I was feeling a little better, but still tired. On Tuesday I felt better still and I noticed that I wasn&#39;t bloated as much. It seemed like I was getting back to normal.

                                                My left arm started to sting immediately after getting the shot, then the stinging subsided.  My left arm started to hurt later in the day and I had pain all the way down my left arm and left side of my chest. This pain throughout my left side was not helped by Ibuprofen and  made sleep very hard.  I had intermittent sharp pain in my neck, shoulder, and left arm for days.  The injection site turned red, hot, and a raised area the size of a silver dollar appeared  and was med-red in color for about 8 days.  The color is better/ almost normal as of today, but still a hard lump under the skin and a bit itchy.  This has caused pain throughout my back and shoulders since I got the shot....but it has not been activity limiting.  I had a slight bit of nausea for a couple of days as well.  My husband had his shot just after mine and experienced  Chills , headache, and nausea at about 9:00 P.M.  His chills subsided at about 3:00 A.M.  He continued with the headache for another day/ fatigue for 2 days/ and nausea for about 5 days.  He has also had tingling in his left arm (about 7 days)  and a funny tingling on his tongue for about a week.

Finally fell asleep around 5:30am still with a really bad headache.  Woke up at 11:00am.  Brushed my teeth and started to feel nausea.  I went back to my bedroom and I got lightheaded to where my vision was blurred.  Layed on the bed and felt really bad with a sweaty face and still nauseas.  Had someone bring me grapes and some tea and layed there.  I felt bad for about 45 min. then I fell asleep.  Got up about 3:30 hours later feeling better, but not 100%  Still a bit of a headache but nausea went away.  Today I feel back to my normal self.  I thought you&#39;d like to know I did experience some of the side effects for your records.

                                                On the night of March  18th, around 2am on the Friday morning, I woke up with a vicious headache -- a steady pressure and pain in my whole head. By far the worst headache I&#39;ve ever had. I sat in the shower for about 40 mins trying to get it to go away, it didn&#39;t. I took a Tylenol when I got out of the shower which I immediately vomited up . After a while I was drained enough that I was able to go back to sleep. Headaches continued for more than a week, though not as awful (I was more or less functional). On March 26th I requested an appt and was seen right away.

                                                Was stressed and run down in weeks prior to shot (taking care of mother dying of cancer who passed 04//01/21) so was not able to determine if experiencing side effects of just continued fatigue. Sore arm, bruised. Monday evening 04/12/21 felt sick, nauseous. Unusual for me. Continuing to feel sick each day since then and called in sick to work today. When I move around I feel worse. My chest feels like I am on the verge of getting really sick. I can breathe but just do not feel good. Feel worse when having a conversation with people. Feel better resting. I have no fever. My blood pressure and heart rate are normal. This is the sickest I have felt since before the pandemic. I called a nurses hotline yesterday and was told to call 911 is I had chest discomfort. I do not feel sick enough to call 911 and could drive myself if I need to go to the hospital. Best way to describe my symptoms is feel like I am on the verge of getting a bad chest cold. Had a headache last night and did not take anything. Woke up in the middle of the night with a very painful headache and took 2 Tylenol which made the headache subside. I have been feeling worse each day since Monday. Today is Thursday. Am wondering if I have COVID-19 and have called a clinic to schedule a COVID test that will be paid for by my work. Am waiting for a return call. All I know is that I feel sick and was not feeling this way before having the vaccine.

To this day I am still dealing with the headache, the pain not just in the arm but allover, gastro intestinal problems. It has impacted my sleep tremendously because the level of pain is very high. The one thing that went away that very first night was the low fever.  But this vaccine is like a Wish (cheap store) Vaccine. They SHOULD NOT give this to immunocompromised people and the &#34;few days&#34; rhetoric does not apply to us and that should be specified! Initially I thought this was to be expected when I heard a Doctor on the news say: &#34;if you fell like you got ran over by a truck, that is normal.&#34; So,  that is how I felt, so I thought it was normal.

I woke up with a swollen juggler vein that ended up being a blood clot, 10 days later my arm was swollen up twice the size of my leg, the juggler was still swollen. I call the urgent care nurse they said to go to ER. I went to hospital got a CAT scan and ultrasound, I was given a shot of warfarin that was supposed to last for 12 hours. I went home and the next morning instead of going to the hospital, I went to hospital and they found 2 blood clots in brain, arm and leg and neck. I have had no history of blood clots and this all happened after the J&amp;J vaccine. They did a procedure where they tried to put a balloon to relieve the pressure. The blood clots in the brain cannot be removed because of their location and it would be dangerous to remove and I am on blood thinners for the rest of my life. Multiple blood clots in body brain, arm and shoulder.

I couldn&#39;t take a deep breath and I couldn&#39;t exert myself at all without it hurting in my chest.  The 2nd symptom, I went to doctor (21 days after) and he checked my platelets. I woke up three times during the night with pain in my left calf. A couple of nights previously I woke up with those same pains in my left calf, as well. It was worse pain the second time. I went to the dr and he did bloodwork. I did not have any other pains after that.

                                                Immediately Saturday: spacey and throat feels strange; afternoon: body is cold/tired. Sunday: felt great! lots of energy until during a walk at 3pm started to feel spacey (hands feel weird) and spiked a short term fever. Tired and cold. Monday: tired, bottom of lungs burning like I inhaled campfire smoke for a week straight, stumbling over words. Tues: tired, more burning lungs but sensation moving to mid chest (NOT heartburn), feeling like I needed to cough but nothing in lungs, still tired, still struggling with full sentences, irritable. Weds: felt hot but temp was below normal, lungs burning. Took Covid test (negative), incredibly tired, got the spacey feeling and hands felt weird-lasted 30 mins. Thurs: tired, irritable, left side hurt, started having to clear my throat every 20-30 minutes, cold. Fri: still tired, felt like I needed to cough but didn&#39;t reduce the pressure in chest/burnin/aching. Slept 14 hours. Sat: woke up feeling awful. Short of breath, clearing throat all day. Went to urgent clinic. Lab/chest x-ray and EKG all negative. Dr:&#34;Nothing we can do for you. This vaccine is too  new and you are likely having a reaction. Come see us if it gets worse.&#34; I almost cried. When he had me take 4-6 deep breaths to check my lungs with his stethoscope I almost passed out. Now I&#39;m home stuck on the couch under an electric blanket feeling like crap with no relief in sight. Hoping no one else has this ever.

                                                Received the shot at a drive-thru event and then was directed to park in a lot with an EMT squad on standby to wait in my car case of adverse reaction. Due to a prior reaction to vicodin I was asked to wait 30 minutes. I began reading on my phone, and after 10 minutes passed I noticed I was becoming very short of breath and was having difficulty mentally focusing on what I was reading. As this was not an expected reaction, I decided to wait a bit before honking my horn to request assistance. After 5-7 minutes, the feeling went away and my breathing and concentration returned to normal. I waited an additional 30 minutes just in case, but have been fine for the past 6 hours without even a sore arm. Had anything been in bloom in the surrounding area, I would have presumed rolling down my window allowed me to breathe pollen that triggered my allergies, but it is still too early in the spring for that. Weather was 53 F, sunny and dry.

I got up and walked back over to my waiting chair and my Husband got up and received his vaccine.    Besides the pain in my left arm,  I started feeling weird tingling sensations and spaced out.  When my Husband sat back down next to me,  my stomach had a burning sensation and I felt slightly nauseated.  Then I felt like I was about to faint.  My Husband and the Staff kept me from falling, The Staff brought ice packs to put on my neck.  They said I turned white and profusely sweat.   I don&#39;t remember all of it, my Husband filled in the blanks.  I started feeling better and we left @4:30.

I got the vaccine at 9am.  around 4pm that afternoon i started feeling sick.  by 7:30pm I was in bed thinking I was going die!   By midnight, I got up and tried to walk to the stairs but i was to weak to walk.  I could not sleep.  I was up for 36 hours!  I was nauseous, dizzy, weak, exhausted.  Every inch of my body had pain!!!  I was tingling all over.  I  had the chills until midnight.  My heart would race and then stop... then race again... I was having difficulty breathing!  I tried standing up but I couldn&#39;t.  I would have driven myself to the emergency room but I couldn&#39;t walk.  by noon the next day, my heart regulated, I was able to breath easier.  I was still exhausted and full of pain and tingling.  Today, I still have some pain, but no tingling.

The headache lasted a solid 24 hours almost to the point of vomiting even while taking 4 tylenol every 4 hours then my stomach was empty so I ate a few crackers, but that next night it was hard to go to sleep.  At night I suddently realized my forehead seemed larger than normal!  It really felt bigger and swollen  so I massaged it and could feel my layers of skin/dermis moving around I beleived it was the serum from the shot from all the prone position I was in for so long laying in bed.  Thankfully the next day all syptoms went away gradually and by the third day I was back to normal....at least I THINK my forehead has returned to normal so far as I can see or feel.

                                                About 6 hours after receiving the vaccine I started getting a headache and felt chills. I was on my way to a hotel before leaving for a flight the next morning and was driving. When I stopped driving and attempted to exit my car, I experienced dizziness and stroke like symptoms. My legs would not hold me up and I felt as if I would pass out in the road. I held on to the car for several minutes until the feeling abated somewhat. Then I made my way unsteadily into the  hotel building and had to sit down for several minutes. My heart was beating rapidly and I felt strange so I took one of my nitroglycerin and also took an extra 12.5 mg Coreg.  After being taken to my room, I laid on the bed and continued to feel  weak, lightheaded and became very nauseous. I got out my pulse oximeter and my pulse was 95.  I took another Coreg and it seemed to slow it down for a little while but again it started racing and I continued to be nauseous and broke out in sweats and my pulse got back up to 100. I took another nitroglycerin and a baby aspirin in case I was having a heart attack. Then I took another Coreg. My pulse rate finally slowed down. I slept intermittently until going to the airport at 5 a.m.  I still felt weak and nauseous and very tired.

                                                FYI, Approx. 1:00 AM woke up with high fever and could hardly move. Whole body hurt very bad. Shaking from chills . Bad headache. Very thirsty. Definitely flu like symptoms, but worse. Turned electric blanket on, very cold, and just tried to sleep. Only getting out of bed to use restroom and more water. Straight back to bed. I did not vomit, nor did I have diarrhea.  Could not stand it any longer Saturday PM approx. 10:00 took two Advil. Woke up Sunday 8:00 AM felt much better. Still had slight symptoms, but I could do chores. My brother kept checking on me. Came to let my dog out. My brother wanted me to call 911 but I can not afford that.  It was holiday weekend,  I wanted to die, didn?t care.  I get the flu shot every year. I have a high pain tolerance, very rare for me to be sick.  If I needed a second dose. I would NOT get it. If I would have known it was that bad, I would not have signed up to get it. Thank you.

My coffee didn&#39;t take right. By 4:00 pm, I wasn&#39;t feeling right.  Became flushed, an elevated temperature of 99 degrees,  with flu-like symptoms.  I was terribly dehydrated.  When I arrived home, I made a sandwich and 12 oz of seltzer water.

I went to bed at 9:00 PM and woke up around 1:00 AM with an excruciating headache and felt nauseous I took 2 more Tylenol, but could not fall back asleep. I felt very nauseous and was unable to go back to sleep. Oddly, I was sitting up wide awake and for a period of about 30 minutes, I began seeing brightly colored images that looked like they were floating in front of me. It was extremely odd as my eyes were open and I was awake. I finally fell back asleep around 5:30 AM and had horrifying vivid nightmares. When I woke up around 8:00 AM my headache was still there and I felt somewhat nauseous but not as bad as during the night.  My headache continued through the day on Saturday and I continued to take Tylenol about every 6 hours. I attempted to go to bed around 9 PM when I experienced horrible chest pain that radiated through my chest and into the left side of my throat. This was frightening because the pain did not let up for 7 to 8 hours, even after taking a Tagamet. I&#39;ve never suffered from heartburn previously other than when I was 8 months pregnant with twins. I was lucky to have any medication at home and that was only because my husband suffered from heartburn frequently. I finally fell asleep around 6:00 am for just a few hours and woke up feeling tired, but no headache or chest pain. Other than feeling tired, the symptoms appeared to all be gone. On a positive note, my arm never became sore!

                                                Within 25-30 minutes I felt a very sore area on my right side just up from the bottom of my rib cage. I reached for it and I could touch the exact spot with one finger. It was almost like if you had run into the corner of a table really badly. It came on fast. Within less then 10 min later it felt like a small balloon was getting inflated with the sore spot right in the center expanding. The soreness was not that big just this strange feeling like that area was expanding just like a balloon. I would say it was about an 8&#34; circle. This strange feeling and soreness lasted all evening. It even woke me up in the middle of the night. It was slowly gone by the end of the next day. The next day I only felt a little tired and not well. Nothing major. I have not heard of anything like this. I have no doubt this was from the shot. I had only gotten in my car to drive home. As soon as I pulled in my garage it came on very suddenly. No other reason for this.

                                                Patient reported an extreme burning sensation at time of injection. She described it as like &#34;lightening&#34;, both electrical and heat that radiated from the injection site to her fingertips.  Pain started with administration of vaccine.  She felt &#34;crumby&#34; on Saturday.  Today she no longer feels the burning sensation, but has a 1/2&#34; ring around injection site that is swollen and bruised. She also reported feeling a knot under her skin.  She did not seek medical attention and was quite embarrassed that she cried after her injection.

                                                Okay left voicemail with cdc and wrote this email  I?m not sure how to report symptoms I had after taking the jannsen vaccine March 6. Because of the new reports I thought it may be helpful.  To begin in late nov 2020 my roommate was confirmed covid.  I was exposed tremendously and never tested because if I did not get it from him, I was immune.  He was very ill.  He talked of getting head pains as well.  I got sick for a weekend but not super ill.  Tired, headache and head pains in one spot.   After my vaccine I felt the same illness but ran a fever with the shot.  My main recognition was I had the exact same head pains, same exact spot I had when I?m sure I had Covid. 1 unusual symptom I had after the shot was I felt like I had a 4? metal plate wrapped around my arm where I got the shot for a half day.   Hope this helps.

Even after two weeks I would try to convince myself to pull over  in my truck and take a nap!  I am still extremely tired.  My  Heart was pounding, throbbing in ?my ears?.  I could hear it so loudly . 2weeks of brain fog ? could not stay on task (due to dehydration?)  I still can?t drink enough water and Gatorade to satisfy my thirst. Extreme Weakness, Nausea , especially when I would try to eat .  Increased thirst/ urination .  My ankles and feet swelled .  My friend who is a pharmacist instructed me to take a Tylenol but I couldn?t even get out of bed to get one to take.  ? any movement made my head swim and I felt like I would throw up.  I slept most of that day and also the next day

                                                Began to feel poorly about 7 hours post injection.  Basically like I was getting the flu but the onset was very fast.  Within an hour I had severe chills, body aches, headache and shivering.  This lasted for about 6 - 8 hours and then began to subside.  I never registered a fever.  The following day I just felt kinda blah, without a lot of energy but all symptoms were gone.

Ringing is mostly constant and tolerable and doesn&#39;t prevent day to day activities, although can make it harder to focus at work. Does affect my ablitiy to fall back to sleep once I&#39;ve woken (at say 4 AM). Seems to be worse in early morning, when it is typically quiet.  Haven&#39;t seeked medical attention so far.

                                                At 23 hours post Johnson and Johnson vaccination, I began to have a 10/10 headache (which was the worst headache of my life), nausea and severe aura. I then became extremely confused and was taken to the emergency department by my husband. The following was reported to me the next day when I awoke in the ICU at Hospital: within an hour of arriving at the ED, I exhibited a progressive hyperactive delirium, agitation, slurred speech (word salad), combativeness, confabulation, word finding difficulties and an inability to follow commands. The neurologist in the ED said that she was seeing this adverse vaccination side effect in other patients at the 24-hour period. I received Haldol, Zyprexa, and Ativan to control the delirium and received a head CT angiogram in the ED, which was normal. I was transferred by ambulance to the main hospital due to acute metabolic encephalopathy/altered mental status. I was admitted to the neurological unit whereby I became critically hypotensive (60s over 30s) and was transferred to the ICU due to persistent hypotension unresponsive to IV normal saline. I was then transferred and admitted to the ICU and was given continued IV fluid resuscitation and Levophed vasopressor. I was eventually weaned from vasopressors and was discharged back home in three days exhausted, bruised, fatigued and with continuous clouded mentation. I have been told by all of the doctors that this was a vaccination side-effect, which caused cerebritis. I was subsequently treated as an outpatient at Hospital for intractable aura with IV Valporic Acid, Magnesium, and Lasix infusion on April 1, 2021.

                                                I got the JNJ vaccine on Wed 4/7/21 (a wk before FDA paused that covid vaccine).  Initial response was Extreme Fatigue, but starting 11:45 pm on 4/18/21, I suffered headache, chest pain, short of breath. I could not sleep at all till 4/19/21 PM after asking my kids to pray for me. In case it&#39;s just heartburn, I took TUMS at 8:15 pm  on 4/19/21 . Headache, short of breath comes and goes, but the chest pain persists, and I develop a hot flash.  I never took birth control pills, but my OB/GYN prescribed daily Estrogen (to prevent osteoporosis) and every 3 month, Progesterone for 10 days (to prevent breast cancer). Estrogen &amp; Progesterone happen to be the birth control pills&#39; composition.  On 4/17/21, I finished my 10 days Progesterone regime. I discontinued the Estrogen supplement on 4/19/21 or 4/20/21, now (4/23/21 1:20 am) no more chest pain, but still feel fatigue, feverish with a hazy/foggy head (not really a headache).   I have a suggestion for JNJ, FDA, CDC on JNJ vaccine warning label.   If indeed those 6 women are all on birth control pills which are composed of synthetic estrogen and progesterone, then the warning label should also warn people who take these hormone supplements, instead of just an age range.

I called my urologist and was seen on 04-14-2021. My blood platelets were extremely low. I was then referred to see a hematologist who sent me to the hospital. I was admitted at Hospital where they performed lab work, MRI&#39;s and CT scans. I stayed two days at the hospital. The hematologist who saw me said I have thrombocytopenia. Other tests were also performed and they checked me for stroke and I did not have a stroke. I am concerned due to my thrombocytopenia, if I get cut, I will bleed a lot and this is interfering with my job and to carry out my daily functions.   I am still not recovered and my platelets are low. I still have to follow-up with my PCP and my hematologist has to check my bone marrow as the next step of treatment.

                                                When I received the injection, I experienced a sharp intense burning pain which shot up my shoulder, neck and behind my ear. This has never happened before. My shoulder/arm were sore for approximately one week which seemed typical to how I respond to a vaccine. After a week I began experiencing a sharp pain in my neck and shoulder area which has gradually worsened to where I am now icing it multiple times per day. There is also numbness and tingling down my forearm and into my thumb and index finger.  The pain is unmanageable at times and I am unable to get a full nights rest and have near constant pain when keyboarding.
