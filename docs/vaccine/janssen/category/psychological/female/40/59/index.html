                                                Dizzy, run down two hours after injection. Woke up 4 am then off and on with extreme body pain, sore neck , lower back, right hand and arm. Headache and fatigue at 6:45 am got up with two children (2 yrs and 10 months) ate small breakfast by 9 am I couldn?t get off the couch or stay awake. My head started aching and my eyes hurt, I felt extreme chills two thick blankets weren?t enough to warm me. Extreme fatigue, stomach pain and loss of appetite. I fell asleep and didnt have the energy to walk to my bed until 2:30 pm.  It set off my stomach and I was vomiting off and on until around 9 pm. By then I could keep little bits of fluid and food down. Then I was hot. I felt flushed but had no fever. My usual heart rate is 52-54 bpm via Watch while laying down. My heart rate during this hot period laying in bed was 102 -101 bpm. Which is consistent for my workout heart rate. I went to sleep and woke up 7 am with my kids and was well enough to take care of them but not do all my usual chores. I couldn?t bend down or put my head lower than chest or the extreme throbbing headache was back. Still had body aches and fatigue but nowhere near yesterday. It is 11:22 pm Sunday and I feel spent.

                                                patient received Janssen Covid 19 vaccine at our clinic inside store. pt was waiting in waiting area for 15 minutes and she informed us she was not feeling well and felt like passing out. She had been waiting less than 10 minutes.  I went to her and she said she was feeling very strange and was nauseous. I tried to get her up but she couldn&#39;t walk so I let her sit back down. She was not able to communicate with me but was conscious. She said her vision was distorted. her lips started to turn blue and I continued to monitor her. I called 911 and she said she was having difficulty catching her breath so I went for the epipen and gave her 0.3 mg in the outer thigh of her right leg. her color started to improve and she was able to comunicate better. I followed EMS instructions and continued to monitor her until they arrived.

                                                A few seconds after vaccine was given I had a sensation go up my left jawline that felt similar to a nerve pain.  I didn&#39;t think much of it and waited the 10 minutes after my vaccine and had no other symptoms.  I left the pharmacy and started driving home and had a sudden sensation of a heaviness in my chest and trouble taking a deep breath.  I also felt like my tongue and throat were swelling slightly.  I had a warm sensation throughout the middle of my back that felt like a heating pad was on it.  I felt light-headed and called my husband.  As I continued to drive my symptoms worsened and I called 911.  I made it home in my car and the ambulance met me there.  My husband called the pharmacy to ask them what we should do and they said that it would be ok for him to give me Benadryl.  I took 15mL of liquid Benadryl shortly before the ambulance arrived.   Within 15-20 minutes, I felt like I was able to swallow better.  In the ER, I received IV Benadryl and Famotidine.  I was also given 800mg of Ibuprofen for a bad headache I developed.  My oxygen level remained in the high 90&#39;s and my symptoms were much improved after the IV medication.  I was instructed to continue taking Benadryl capsules for the next few days along with Pepcid to keep my symptoms from flaring back up.  I noticed this morning when waking up that the left side of my face as well as my throat felt odd so I took the Pepcid and Benadryl and symptoms were relieved in 30 mins or so.

                                                Head ache and fever started the evening of March. Severe vertigo and nausea began sometime overnight or early the next morning. I was bed-ridden most of the day. I took zofran and ibuprofen. From then on the severe vertigo happened only while changing positions such as laying down and getting up. I saw a nurse practitioner on March 16th who told me it was due to ear wax. I received a prescription (meclizine) for the nausea and dizziness and bought an ear wax kit. The next a friend said her husband had the exact same symptoms as I was experiencing and that it was called facility. My husband assisted me with the epley maneuver twice on March 17th. By March 18th the vertigo was gone, with just slight dizziness during the day.

Administered Toradol and IV fluids, discharged me with good vitals, but still tachycardia, headache, and vomiting. The next day (3/20), I still had a bad headache and could  not keep liquids down. I vomited perhaps 12 times, then called the doctor. She sent me to Urgent Care to receive injections of Toradol and Phenergan. Within the hour, I  could drink. Then shortly after, I  could eat. I  felt better for one day. The next day (3/22), my heart started pounding, and I was unable to sleep horizontally. I  needed to sleep on 3 pillows due to chest discomfort. My chest still feels very uncomfortable. Abdominal breathing is helping to an extent. I have had to stay in bed and greatly reduce my activities since receiving the vaccine.  Today is one week, and I am still in bed.

Around 12:30 am (March 30th) (about 6 hours after receiving the Johnson and Johnson COVID) vaccine I woke up with chills, body aches all over and a headache. That along with fatigue continued for about 28 hours. I missed a day of work due to not feeling well. The following day (March 31st) I still felt tired and spacey. My headache was better. But I started having hot flashes and more minor body aches. Not as severe body aches as the previous day. April 1st I felt back to normal. I called my doctor&#39;s nurse on March 30th to ask if I could take Tylenol to help with my bad headache. She advised not to so I didn&#39;t take any Tylenol or Ibprophen.

                                                Around 6 hours after vaccine, I had uncontrollable chills. This led to a low grade fever. I tried to sleep it off, but woke up with my heart racing- My resting BPM was around 120. My skin was super sensitive. I started taking 2 extra strength Tylenol every 6 hours around 5pm, and that helped a little. I couldn&#39;t focus on anything- I could basically stare at the wall while my heart was hammering. I finally slept, and woke up soaked in sweat with my fever broken (my fever never got above 99) around 2am, and improved steadily after that.

My body was feeling heavier. I tried to sleep again and was waking up every 1 hour. In the morning, I was feeling like a truck went over me: headache, feeling tired and body pain. I was monitoring the  fever and it went away at around 6am. But I was feeling very tired the entire day and headache stopped at around 3pm. in the night, symptoms were mild. Next day (today) I&#39;m feeling better than yesterday (back to work), but not 100% - would say 80%.

                                                My vaccine was administered at 12:30pm. I waited until 12:55 at CVS after the vaccine to make sure there were no reactions. I also move my arm around a lot after the injection to keep it from hurting. I drove home, at lunch and about 2:45 was hit with a very noticeable headache. I never get headaches and eat healthy and consume about a gallon of water a day. I knew it wasn&#39;t from dehydration or being hungry.  Headache was in the temple area and made my eyes hurt in the same way they would if you had cried for an extended period of time or were overtired. At 3pm a wave of exhaustion hit me. I was sitting working trying to combat the headache and felt almost wiped out. I got through the rest of my work day (4:30) and went to lay down immediately. I passed out almost instantly until 7 pm. I work up and showered, ate dinner and started to feel a little warm. It should be noted it was an unseasonably warm day and got up to 77, so it was a tiny bit warm in my home. I put on loose fitting clothes and slayed on the couch still with the bad headache and the injection site started to throb so I placed and ice pack on for 20 minutes. I could only stay awake until 8:45 and got in bed. I could not get comfortable for several hours feeling very warm. I tried a fan on high and drinking more water but i felt very warm like how you feel with the flu. I took my temp at 1130pm it was normal. I continued to toss and turn and feel very warm and slightly dizzy, in the sense that I hadn&#39;t been able to sleep and with the headache my body was just exhausted. Around 2 am i woke up for more water and got in the shower because I had sweated so much my sheets were wet and my clothes. I got out of the shower around 10 minutes later, changed and got new sheets and got back in bad. Around 330 I felt very hot again and opened the windows and got another ice pack for my arm which was throbbing again. I finally fell asleep after 3:45am. I got up for work at 6am. I felt slightly foggy, and very hot. But no fever. My temp is normally around 97.4-97.9 and it was 98.4. Still normal but I was running warmer than usual. It took a long time to get ready and despite hot water in the shower I was freezing. i got dress and debated going to work. Got in the car at 6:45 and my drive to work is 30 minutes. 1/2 way into my drive I got very sweaty again and went home to change my clothes because they were too warm. Got to work around 7:20 and still felt warm but they take our temps at the door and min was still okay, no fever. I drank a lot of water and ate, and at 8:30 am all of a sudden the exhaustion was gone and I felt normal. I got home form work at 5:30p and took a 3 hour nap and felt normal again.

                                                I woke up with an excruciating headache (with light sensitivity) that did not initially respond to Tylenol. Although I did not have a fever, I had temperature regulation issues all night - alternating between hot and cold - and woke up sweaty.  Headache responded to Advil in the morning but I still have a minor lingering headache a few hours later.

                                                I noticed it felt like a sinus cold coming on along with face, head and minor toothaches to the my left side of my face on the the 8th or 9th. I took Tylenol everyday for my sore arm and the headaches but it did help suppress them so I didn?t think much of it. My throat also started to feel kind of raw or itchy but I didn?t have a cough and I noticed a slight post nasal drip. Ok the 10th in the evening I felt exhausted and my face and sinuses were much worse. I took cold medicine and fell asleep early but had a hard time sleeping. I?m a side sleeper and if I turned on my left side, my ear felt like it was burning and my face would go numb. It also made me very dizzy. I woke up with body aches and light headed. My throat doesn?t hurt but it feels different. Almost numb like nothing and I can?t smell or taste.

Started with a fever and fatigue, took Advil for muscle aches, Through the night I had sweating and nausea.  I had dizziness upon standing the next day after the vaccine.  About 48 hours after vaccine, I developed a burning sensation in my nose and had a very runny, stuffy nose for one day.  By day 3 after vaccine, everything went back to normal.

I was able to return resume normal activities the next day and have not experienced any other side effects since then that have restricted me from performing my daily activities.

Symptoms got a bit better after a minute. After about 7 minutes another epi-pen was administered as symptoms were starting to get worse again.

                                                Started with chills shortly after getting the injection, which got progressively worse. At 9:30 pm, the evening of injection, chills got worse, along with a headache and muscle aches that started with my shoulders and moved quickly down my body, eventually, ending at my toes. It hurt to move, even my fingers. I took 2 regular strength Tylenol, which helped get me to sleep. I then woke up around 4 am in a puddle of sweat... I took my temp and no fever, but body aches, headache and chills were still prevalent. I spent the next day in bed without moving or eating much - drank a lot of water. Tylenol every six hours. An hour after taking Tylenol, I seemed to be well enough to not be moaning and groaning, but it wore off too quickly and I had two hours of feeling horrible before taking more Tylenol for a bit of relief. I woke Sunday morning around 5 am in another puddle of sweat and severe body aches and headache. I took more Tylenol, went back to sleep and woke around 9 am feeling groggy, but quickly realized that I was feeling 100% better! Just like that. I also had pain at the injection site that for some reason seems to be getting worse today, Sunday (April 4). I do not have swelling or redness. It just feels hot and very very sore and getting worse. Heavy and hard to lift.

                                                3pm: Immediate body-wide, internal feeling that can only be described as &#34;intoxication.&#34; Felt loopy &amp; woozy -- not lightheaded or dizzy. Felt as if I were floating to chair. Sat for 20mins, legs weak, odd sensation across shoulder blades &amp; cervical spine. &#34;Slow&#34; &amp; woozy for duration of evening. Physically moved slow, cognitively slowed down, inability to focus. Internal body-wide sensation difficult to define. All very similar to immediate effects I have from alcohol. Passed out (sleep) 9hrs later &amp; woke 100% fine at 8am.

                                                About 7 hours after the vaccine injection I started to feel flu-like symptoms: aches, chills, woozy and slightly nauseous. Within the next few hours the symptoms became increasingly worse, but not different other than the addition of a headache. I took 2 Tylenol to help with the headache and fever. Overnight sleep was difficult due to chills, sweats, fever dreams and aches. The symptoms lessened the next day (24-hours post injection), but still included muscle/body aches, headache, and extreme fatigue. Again took 2 Tylenol to help. Today (48-hours post injection) I&#39;m feeling quite a bit better although still not 100%. Soreness at injection site persists, especially when lifting my arm.

I have a herniated disc in my lower back and this was severely aggravated by the vaccine. My back and fingers hurt so bad I couldn?t sleep at all. Tried not to take Tylenol finally took some after 3-4 hours and it helped a lot with fever and joint pain. Also had a headache. Fever and pain was gone after 8 hours. Then felt very low energy with a headache all the second day. Third day I felt great except are sore.

                                                Day of vaccine, I felt like my lymph nodes were swollen. Two days later the injection site started to get deep red. Friday I started to about an inch of so, swell up some. Saturday I had a rash on my arm by the injection site, the top part on my bicep was pretty red and swollen. I didn&#39;t take my Humara or Zolar injection. On Sunday the rash got worse and grew in size and really hot to touch, the pain was radiating all the way to my wrist and hurt really bad causing pain when I moved my wrist. It was hard for me to go to sleep so I called the dr and went in . The dr. said it looked less red that what it was and told me to take Ibuprofen 800mg* 3x day.  The pain is now in both wrist and hard for to grip stuff and a little hot to touch.  You can see the difference in the skin tone where the rash was, it looks bruised.

I had a slight fever and just stayed in bed the day after. Ibuprofen seemed to help the headaches but not the body aches. No nausea. Within 72 hours I was almost back to my normal self, but still extremely tired, and my neck and back hurt quite a bit. Today marks 13 days. As of 5 days ago I began to get cold like symptoms. Neck and back still extremely uncomfortable, neck barely able to move side to side. I have a bit of a cough with phlegm. Headaches are still happening quite a bit, and still super tired all the time. I feel like I?ve been sick ever since I took the shot, and have to take several days off work.

Continued nocturnally for 4-5 nights before beginning during daytime hours encompassing both legs &amp; both feet. Spread to left arm on day 5 &amp; then to include right arm a day later. Weakness in all limb muscles. Difficulty walking. Unable to carry heavier items, unable to lift over 5lbs with both arms, unable to move arm from plate to mouth at its worst. All symptoms waxed &amp; waned, Guillian Barre was ruled out due to this. Currently 20 days post vaccine with little relief. Medical care has been sought &amp; is continuing at this time.

I woke up at about 05:00 am with a fever of 101.6. My heart rate was elevated - racing heart. I took some more Tylenol -and I tried to sleep but it was hard to. After a few hours, I felt achy and sore but better. Three days later, had a run of skipped heart beats (Thursday) and heart palpitations. I called my regular doctor on Monday and on Thursday, I called the Cardiologist. I take a beta blocker when I have bad heart palpitations and they continued to happen but were better with the beta blocker. Within a few hours, on Thursday, the symptoms resolved. I still have heart palpitations but the vaccine may have increased them.

                                                At 5:30 pm, I started to have a headache, so I took some Tylenol.  I started to feel a little better.  From about 7:00 pm to about midnight, I felt awful.  I couldn&#39;t walk down a short hall without assistance.  I was so sore and achy I couldn&#39;t really sleep.  I felt insanely hot, yet had chills and I had a terrible headache.  I am type 1 diabetic, and my blood sugar spiked to over 200, where it hovered between 200 &amp; 300 most of the night, despite the fact that I used insulin to try and lower it.  From 10 pm to midnight, I felt nauseous.  Overnight was ok.  I still had some of those symptoms, but could sleep off and on.  I probably woke up every couple of hours.  I was till very sore and hot, but not as hot, and still had a headache.  Today, I took Tylenol this morning.  I still have a mild headache, sore body, tired and a little slow, but significantly better than last night.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I had a slight headache the evening I received the shot.  I woke up feeling extremely tired, groggy.  Fog like and woozy, dizzy for several hours on March 9th, the day after I received the vaccine.  My side effects went away after about 36 hours.

About 2 hours later the chills were alternating with fever and I could barely stand because I felt so weak from the muscle aches. I was in so much physical pain I didn&#39;t sleep at all that night. The fever lasted until late afternoon the next day (about 24 hrs total), and the body aches lasted until late afternoon the day after that (about 48 hrs total).

Woke up with headache and chills at 3:15am.  Took temperature - no fever (98.0).  Went back to sleep until 6am.  Woke up with a headache and chills again and took temperature again - no fever (98.6).  Could only stomach ginger tea.  Attended a computer work meeting at 7am, and couldn&#39;t stay awake after that.  Was back in bed before 8am.  Slept until 10:45am (24 hours after injection) and woke up feeling OK and hungry.  It&#39;s now 1:45 pm April 8, and I feel mostly fine but still unusually tired.

                                                Started with the lower right leg and foot being itchy and red 7 days post vaccine. It then progressed to the right lower leg. After a few hours, the upper legs became red and itchy. It then affected my right arm, a little on my abdomen, and then the right elbow area. Benadryl, a cold shower, and icing the areas made the symptoms go away for several hours, but they returned over night at 3am.  Day 8, the symptoms were gone most of the day, but returned in the evening around 8pm. Benadryl taken and iced down the arms and legs.  Symptoms subsided.  They returned again at 3am and woke me from sleeping. It affected both feet, both legs, both arms, a little on my back and sides.

Most symptoms lasted three full days.  One week after the vaccination and I still have confusion, dizziness, and vertigo like symptoms. If I look up or down or side to side too quickly, I feel extremely dizzy and nauseated. I can?t stand for more than about 5 minutes without feeling dizziness and nausea set in, even getting on my bike causes nausea and dizziness, driving, walking, anything related to movement. **Only had one vaccine - the form added a second set of boxes above and won?t let me remove it on this form.

                                                Extreme fatigue.  Slept most of the time for two days.   Got shot at 10:40 AM.  Left Arm immediately felt odd---sore, heavy, tingly all the way down to my wrist.  By noon, I was asleep.  Slept for about 3 hours.  Up for 3 hours.  Slept for 3.  Up for 3.  Then slept all night.   I had a headache and slept most of the next day.  Definitely felt like my body was fighting something.     I have an approximately 3 inch diameter circle around injection site that is a red, swollen, hard, lump,  It is hot to the touch and extremely sore---at times it itches.  I am shocked how big and hard the knot is.  Its crazy!  I cannot put weight on that arm.  Extremely sore.  It is now 4 days after the vaccine and the knot does not seem to be getting smaller.  In fact, it may be bigger.

I said I wanted to give her benadryl and patient refused. Sat with patient and she reported no changes, just felt different and tingled a little. Patient stated that it did not feel like allergic reactions she has had in the past. Checked tongue and lips for swelling, no sign of anything like that or other signs of anaphylaxis. By the end of allotted 30 min waiting period, patient said she felt normal again. She stayed in the store for another 30 minutes and reported back that she was fine.

                                                Around 7 pm on 3/13, I developed brain fog, trouble walking, and then fever, severe muscle pain worse in legs, and chills.  Most of these symptoms seemed to improve on 3/14, but then on 3/15, I developed new onset of shortness of breath and chest discomfort.  On 3/16 around 1 pm the shortness of breath worsened and I went to the emergency room.  I felt that I couldn&#39;t take a deep breath in and I had chest discomfort on the left side of my chest worse when taking a deep breath.  My legs were hurting as well, especially my left leg.  I had sinus tachycardia (heart rate 106-120) and increased respiratory rate (rate of 20)  with O2 sats 100% on room air.   My breathing and heart rate improved somewhat with 1 liter oxygen therapy, 1 liter of IV fluids, albuterol inhaler, and decadron 6 mg orally.  It was thought that I had a delayed asthmatic/allergic reaction to the vaccine.  I do not have a history of asthma.  I was prescribed a Medrol dose pack and albuterol inhaler.  My hands and feet are very cold and tingling on 3/18.  Shortness of breath and chest pain seems to have improved but not completely gone as of the time of this submission on 3/18.

It hurts to move the arm different ways. Many times, I have to lay flat to  get relief from the pain. I don&#39;t have alot of strength in my left arm since getting the vaccine. I consulted the school nurse about my effects and she stated it could be an inflamed nerve.

                                                Headache started 3 hours after vaccine was administered. Extreme fatigue, nausea, low grade fever (100.2), extremely sore arm  and slight shortness of breath followed. Symptoms lasted 3 days (missed a day of work) and I still have a sore arm 9 days later.  If my arm is bumped or touched at all still quite painful.

                                                Left foot became tingly as if it had fallen asleep starting at around 8:00 pm the evening of the injection. I was sitting on the couch with my legs outstretched and crossed at the ankle in front of me. I thought it was because I had my legs crossed. I uncrossed them. The feeling did not go away. It is now the next day and the feeling is still present. I sit this way often and have never had this happen before. I assume it is due to the vaccine.  It is extremely weird to feel pins and needles constantly in your foot.

I didn&#39;t take my temperature. Another thing that happened was the tip of my right middle finger went numb for a few hours. I noticed this around 7pm the day I got the shot. This numbness has never happened to me before. My fever lasted until the morning after I got my shot. Fatigue lasted into the second day after the shot.

                                                I got the vaccine on Tuesday. That night, I had some slight aches and was warm, but nothing awful. The next day, I was just a bit warm. I exercised on Thursday morning because I felt better (stand up paddling). Then the rest of the day, I was very tired and then Friday and Saturday and Sunday, I was very dizzy, foggy, fatigued, no mental clarity, difficult to hold a conversation and answer questions, no focus. Today, Monday, I still feel like I have a brain fog and am talking very slowly. No focus. Conversations feel tiring.

I was tired for 3 days after. Now the only remaining symptom is living in a fog. I have no health conditions. I am praying this goes away. I am not one to get sick or have any health issues. I don&#39;t use drugs or drink, smoke etc. Very scary. It is impacting my ability to do my job.

Called again at 4:41p and patient said she now had a headache, nausea, chills, hot but no fever.

I left with some dizziness and a headache that remained for a few days. I also had severe body aches for a couple of days and fatigue. Only thing is the arm pain and a little tiredness today.

Fingertips still feel like electricity is running through them and fingers/hands still hurt; extremely hungry/thirsty from 03/25/2021 - 03/29/2021; fatigue, pain at base of skull under ears, tinnitus extremely loud and both ears feel like ear ache; During the night of my high fever, lower back where kidneys are started hurting very badly.  What is still left of that pain on day 5 is a pain radiating from my lower back down my right leg many times throughout the day (treating with ibuphrophen).   Pain around knees, elbows, ankles, and bottom of feet- different than joint pain.  All my POTS symptoms are in high gear (tachycardias, very low BP,  pain, dizzy, vertigo).    If the leg/lower back pain, and left arm problems continue, I will see my neurologist or immunologist.  I have reached out to both to make them aware.  My husband had the JJ shot same day, same place and had zero side affects.

                                                I was directed to my seat (if walking into the room, the first table but the 2nd seat).  The woman was learning the computer system from a gentleman, and she assured me she just didn&#39;t know the computer, but knew how to give a shot.  I pulled my arm out of my sweatshirt and pushed my short sleeve shirt up.  She did the alcohol wipe, then pinched my arm, I looked away as the shot went in.  I felt a horrible pain...not even sure how to describe it, just extreme pain and very achy and said Ow maybe 3 times (I am one that can tolerate quite a bit of pain, and I assumed it would sting, but this was different) as she was injecting me.  She apologized. The gentleman said Johnson and Johnson is a little thicker.  I said to him that I had never ever experienced this much pain with a vaccine before-never.  Again, I am talking about as it was injected. I went to sit down for the waiting area, the gentleman who was handing out cards for reviews asked me about it and I said it hurt so bad, I&#39;d never had a shot hurt that bad.  Another worker (female) overheard me and asked me if it was a burning-she had a burning with hers (think she said moderna). I said I would not necessarily say it was a burning, it was pain. As I sat there, I texted my husband and told him how bad it hurt (with the injection) and I&#39;ve never had a vaccine hurt like that.  I started to wonder if it was administered incorrectly? I looked over and the gentleman was now doing the vaccines and she was watching. My husband had Pfizer and he said that didn&#39;t hurt at all. I was feeling it up into my neck as I was sitting there. I was trying to rub my arm and neck hoping that would help as well as move my arm around. When we could leave, I asked the volunteer if she had heard of anyone else having that much pain DURING the shot.  She said she only heard of maybe one other person that said ow. I left, started to cry in the car because of the pain and experience, then spoke with my husband before I left. I came home and got some ice to put on my arm hoping that would help. I did expect pain in the arm after a shot. Within a couple of hours, I noticed pain going down my arm and into my wrist. I thought maybe I needed to be active with my arm and move it so tried that.  I started to notice more side effects of the vaccine as the evening progressed:  I had the typical side effects I figured I&#39;d have, achy, joint pain, chills, nauseous, no fever though. I was noticing pain into my neck (occasionally even into jaw), shoulder, scapula area of the back, and left side under the bottom part of my ribs.  I was feeling tightness in my chest, too, so I decided to try 2 aspirin to see if it helped with any symptoms. I did have slight dizziness, and a weird sensation in my head-like a zapping? I didn&#39;t sleep well, and had to stay completely off of my left side. Thursday, I felt better than that night, but still tired, achy, nauseous, chills, and not 100%.  My arm still was really affected...it seemed extremely fatigued as well as painful...the pain was radiating up and down and couldn&#39;t raise my arm without it hurting. Around noon I decided to take 2 aleve to see if that would help me at all. It did help with the pain and achiness, but was getting a &#34;nerve-type&#34; pain still up and down my left arm into neck/scapula area down to my wrist and hand/fingers. Still couldn&#39;t sleep on my left side. Friday, I was definitely doing better with all the other symptoms, I could abduct my arm more than 90 degrees, so I was excited about that. I did wake up with my middle/ring finger hurting (at the base of that area) and a bit numb so put my hand in and out of a fist. The pain subsided, but the numbness/tingling sensation was still there. I continued to take aleve hoping that maybe there was just inflammation around the nerve causing the issue.  Aleve did help, but it still never went away completely.  By late afternoon, I was getting concerned if I was permanently affected by this. As I was holding a bowl of food and eating, my left arm was going numb. I was even feeling it into my gluts (sciatica?). Again...all of this was after the shot and only on the side I received the shot. That evening I was able to lay on my left side, but not for long periods of time because it became uncomfortable and arm would go numb. Saturday, I still had the nerve pain and was not in a good spot.  It made me sad, angry, scared, and I didn&#39;t want to talk about it too much-just wanted my arm and all the different radiating pains I was having to be back to normal. I was feeling it up into my neck, scapula, my side(the rib area I previously mentioned), even into my gluts and down leg near ankle as well as down the arm into elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand, fingers (particularly that middle finger and thumb area).  I tried to use my arm as normally as possible thinking maybe I need to just keep it moving, but it would fatigue, especially between shoulder and neck. I tried Ibuprofen on this day.  Again, the pain relievers helped some, but didn&#39;t take it all away. Sunday I was in a horrible spot mentally and crying throughout the day because of the sensations I was feeling still: up and down the arm, shoulder, neck, scapula, side and still into ankle area. I decided I would call my doctor on Monday. Monday, I woke up and was feeling better overall, but still having the nerve sensations down my arm as well as up into shoulder, neck, scapula and my left side.  But everything was not as intense.  I spoke to my doctor who said there was a protocol, a number I needed to call.  Monday night I took ibuprofen because I started to have a horrible headache-didn&#39;t go away completely and still have this morning-not sure if it&#39;s related or just a normal headache. Still feeling tingling nerve sensations into forearm and fingers.  My shoulder/neck area feels fatigued, but so far not noticing the nerve pain yet, so that&#39;s a positive. On Monday,  it seemed to get worse as the day went on, so we will see. I definitely feel in hand/wrist/fingers as I am typing now. I know this is a lot, and I think I&#39;ve captured it.  Again, I had none of this pre-shot.  The pain during injection is what alarmed me most as I expected side effects after the shot, but not this nerve type issue.  For this to be lasting as long as it is concerns me, and the fact that it exhibits on my left side where I got the shot. I am very anxious as it hasn&#39;t gotten back to normal.

The flu-like symptoms included muscle aches, nausea, stomach pain including more significant pain in the upper left stomach area, headache and fatigue with difficulty sleeping.  I needed to take time off from work due to these side effects and had difficulty performing daily activities.  Also experienced pain at injection site that got worse in the first 12 hours and lasted also approximately 36 hours.  Minor nausea, stomach pain and injection site pain have continued after 36 hours with ability to return to daily living activities.

                                                I received the vaccine on March 27, 2021. Seconds after the injection was completed my vision went blurry, but it only lasted a few seconds. On March 28, 2021 I felt like my body was going to explode. My blood in the back of my head was thumping. I tried to take a nap to calm my body down but my body felt comp!eye unrest and thumping. My urine made the whole inside of the toilet water look like a white thick cloud.  I have never seen my urine look like that in my life. I used my husbands blood pressure monitor and my blood pressure was 152/104!  I arrived at urgent care about 5:30 PM. They gave me a blood pressure pill. I have never had a blood pressure pill my entire life. They also took a urine sample since I told them about the my very strange looking urine. They found protein and blood in my urine. The culture days later showed no infection. I am still having issues with the high blood pressure.

Dizziness lasted for a few minutes which created nausea. Sat at site for approximately 25 minutes after shot. Left arm was sore between shoulder and elbow, which was to be expected. Later in the evening, experienced fatigue. When trying to go to bed around 11pm,  my left are was throbbing. I did take Tylenol at about 6pm. Throughout the AM hours, sever body aches started, extreme fatigue throughout the following day. Flu like symptoms continued the next day.  I had heard of these symptoms for the other shots but not for Johnson and Johnson. Hungry but too weak to actually cook.

                                                Vaccination administered 3/12/2021 @ 1213, left deltoid (Johnson and Johnson lot 1805020)  While in recovery area at 1243, patient stands from her chair and states that &#34;I feel funny, and I have to walk&#34;.  RN asks patient to elaborate on reasons why she is needing to ambulate and encourages patient to sit for assessment.  She states, &#34;No, I really don&#39;t want to sit, I feel like I need to walk.  I have a tingling down the back of my neck, it really feels warm actually hot, I think if you take my vitals it will only make it worse&#34;.  RN again requests that patient sit and allow for vital signs to be taken, patient refuses, and asks for water.  RN provides a bottle of water for patient and she says that she would like to stay in recovery a little longer.  Patient ambulates in area for (with RN observation) and verbalizes that she is feeling a little better with walking.  Again, upon visual examination no changes noted in patient skin on neck or sholders.   At 1248 patient agrees to sit, but again refuses additional assessment.   By 1247, patient states that she is feeling better, denies dizziness and states that heat in neck has decreased.  Patient reports having similar reaction after taking Compazine. By 1250, patient verbally expresses that she is ready to depart clinic.  Advised to seek medical attention after departure if necessary, with increase or significant change in symptoms. Patient verbalizes understanding.  Ambulates from clinic alone at 1251.

                                                2 hours after the vaccine, I started to feel very achy, and had terrible chills.  That lasted through the night and I woke up with a slight fever, 99.9.  The aches were in my joints and muscles.  It actually felt like I was having back labor. I took advil, and I was able to sleep and sweat out the fever. These symptoms were similar to one of my worst Lupus flares.  These symptoms lasted until Tuesday, 3/9/21, afternoon.  The following Sunday, my joints feel extremely stiff and achy.  Not sure if it has anything to do with the vaccine.  I took Advil and it seemed to help.

It felt like my bones were made out of glass and someone had taken a hammer to my bones.  My face was swollen and red.  Unable to sit up.  Walk from bed to toilet only.  Overall, I would say extreme flu-like symptoms.  Temperature 99.6 all day.   I could not take the pain any further at 4:20 pm and took 1,000 mg of Tylenol.  I finally fell asleep and woke up at 8:30pm and could walk again and my fever had broken.  I still don&#39;t feel great, but I think the worst is behind me.

The staff noticed I was in some distress and kept asking if I was okay to which I replied I thought I&#39;d be fine once I got some fresh air.  Left the facility to drive home and didn&#39;t feel right, Within 30 minutes, developed chest pains, rash and labored breathing.  I recognize the symptoms as the same symptoms I get when I&#39;ve had morphine, which I now must list as an allergy.  This lasted 4 hours, then got better.  The next day around 1:00, I became ill again with flu-like symptoms and had to leave work.  Headache and body aches mostly.  I was ill with these symptoms for a 24 hour period.  Hopefully all symptoms have passed, except my arm which is red, swollen, itchy and feverish.

I was monitored and was given a shot of benedryl and was sent home after a while.   The next day I felt really groggy, latargic and had diarreah.  That monday the numbness went up to my ear and I reached out to my PCP who prescribed a steroid.   Later that evening I got a really bad headache and the tingling and numbness hit my feet then went up my legs, my arms and up and down my body.  Its a feeling as if my body has fallen asleep.

I felt like that for the rest of the day. I took Tylenol as the clinic recommended. Then after I went to bed later that evening I developed a headache that woke me up around 3:00am. I was very uncomfortable, experienced chills and was sore all over like I had worked out hard. I also experienced joint pain which I don&#39;t normally have. I still feel rough this morning and running a slight fever of 100F. I just wanted to report my side effects.

                                                within an hour, it my head felt like a had sinus pressure and had foggy &#34;mind&#34;. Arm was sore but no more than any other vaccine. close to 4 hours later, headache started, felt hot and cold. Hard to sleep, sweating a lot during the night. Headache was so bad it felt like a combination of a bad flu with a hangover. felt very thirty. In the morning I was dizzy, hot, cold, temp 99.8, sick to my stomach, coudn&#39;t taste food very well, just like when you have the flu, nothing taste good. I spend the following day in and out of sleep, very tired, hard to focus. The sensation for being hot and cold continued. Took Imitrex to alleviate the headache/migraine . I did help, but not much. Hard to eat due to an upset stomach. Today is the first full day. I hope I&#39;m better tomorrow

I have had pain in my left arm from the shoulder to the elbow for the past 5 days and it seems to get worse.  Ibuprofen and Tylenol did not seem to help much.  It is difficult to use the arm because of the pain .  I can?t sleep right now so I figured I would fill this out.

When I got out of bed I was lightheaded and passed out in the bathroom as I was getting Tylenol.  I took 2 Tylenol and had diarrhea about 10 mins later.  I went to get some gatorade and passed out again in the hallway on the way to the kitchen.  About an hour after taking Tylenol symptoms began to improve but became nauseous and couldn&#39;t get back to sleep.  As of 2pm Sunday current symptoms are extreme nausea and extreme exhaustion.

                                                The next day after the shot, I had a small rash on my wrist.  It disappeared during the day.  Saturday evening, my right thigh felt like it received a trauma like a hit, but I did not have an injury.  An area the size of my hand is slightly pink on the thigh.  On Tuesday, I tried starting ibuprofen, but it did not really remedy the pain.  I went to urgent care Wed. evening.  They sent me for an ultrasound to rule out blood clots.  No blood clots, but lymph nodes were visible in ultrasound.  They suggested I follow-up with PCP.  On Thursday and Friday, the leg felt crampy but less painful.  Friday night the pain traveled down my right leg to ankle as well as right lower lung had dull ache.  Returned to urgent care.  They are treating the leg for cellulitis (1000mg daily of generic Keflex.)  They said if the leg felt better in 24 hrs, probably cellulitis, but if not, it might be a response to vaccine.  There is no relief after 3 doses and 24 hr &#43; later.

                                                Approximately a half hour after the Janssen vaccine was administered on Monday, March 15, 2021 at 2:00pm, I felt a dull ache/sensation in the back, lower part of my head. No other symptoms that day. Today is Tuesday,  March 23 and I am still experiencing side effects from the vaccine. The side effects, other than the &#34;brain ache&#34; come and go. The side effects include what I can describe as a &#34;brain&#34; ache, some itching (3/16), random sweating, arms feeling like dead weight, overall general feeling sick, random body aches (don&#39;t last long), dragging of feet when walking, noises being louder than what they actually are, brain &#34;fog&#34;, dizziness, nausea, tingling in legs and feet .  What I describe as a &#34;brain ache is a different feeling than a headache or migraine.  It is as if my brain actually hurts. A very notable side effect that occurred on  Wednesday, March 17, was an episode of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. Throughout my life I have experienced AIWS  at bedtime.  On Wednesday, I experienced an episode during the day and it lasted for three hours.  My session is going to log me out.  I cannot type anymore.  Please contact me for more inforamtion.

At 2 pm I started feeling warm, not feverish. 12 hours after the shot I started feeling achy and cold. When I woke up on March 25th, I was achy, with chills and internal heat, no fever though. Basically every muscle hurt and I really couldn&#39;t move.  I spent the entire day in bed unable to eat or even move. I had to take the day off from work.   I think I had Covid in Feb 2020 before testing began. The symptoms I felt in February 2020 were exactly the same beginning 12 hours after the vaccine.

I was up all night with insomnia and muscular pain.  I had a low grade temperature of 100.3 starting around 12:30 AM.  Today, 4/7 I&#39;ve had low grade temperature around 99 and severe muscle cramping in both legs early morning.  Right now at 4:30 PM on 4/7, my temp is gone but I remain extremely fatigued and have muscle cramping in both legs.  I tried taking a nap today and failed to sleep. The last time I was able to sleep was Monday night 4/5. I am hoping this will resolve itself by tomorrow 4/8.  If symptoms don&#39;t resolve by 4/8 I will contact my PCP on 4/9. Thank you hope this information helps. I didn&#39;t expect to have insomnia as a symptom of this vaccine.

                                                About 5 or 6 hours after the shot , I developed body aches and chills and had a fever of 101. This lasted through the night, along with a sharp pain in my chest that developed in the night and radiated from front to back, which made it difficult to sleep. During the night, I took some rolaids and moved the couch to sleep more upright, because I think the pain may have been heartburn or some other GI thing (I rarely get this feeling, but I have had it before, and my last meal of the day was several hours before i went to bed and before my symptoms started). By morning the next day (Sunday), my whole left arm was achy, down to my hand and fingers, and my right arm also but not as severe. My left armpit felt tender (and still does today, but not as bad).  By mid-day, I started to feel better, the fever was gone, and by late afternoon, the body aches were gone. My left arm and hand was still tender, but not as bad. By Sunday night i would say I was back to about 80%, and by Monday morning, 95%, and by late Monday morning, back to normal, other than the slight tenderness I still feel (today being Tuesday) in my left armpit.

                                                I had the shot on weds afternoon. On Thursday I felt ill with flu-like symptoms, mainly body aches and headache. These symptoms were gone by Friday and I felt great. I woke up Saturday morning at 4:30am and needed to use the bathroom/, which is about 10 steps from my bed. As I entered the bathroom I completely blacked out, causing me to fall and break my ribs. This has never happened to me, and there was nothing else wrong with me (I spent 2 days in the hospital checking heart, brain, inner ear, etc). In addition to the 4:30am blackout, it also happened again several hours later at 11am, saturday morning. This time I again got so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stay on my feet, and while my husband was right there lowering me to the floor I was in a daze, a cold sweat, and absolutely no control over it.

                                                At 12 hours through 16 hours after administration of the vaccine I experienced rigorous shivers, feeling freezing cold to the bone for hours and couldn&#39;t get warm (even with piles of blankets), periodic heart pain and some chest pressure, periodic knife like stabbing pain in my right knee, mild nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, severe weakness, sometimes a cough.  At 16 hours I got up to get water and had to hold onto things to keep my balance. After drinking a couple of cups of water, I turned away from the bathroom sink and lost consciousness, fainting and falling onto my bathroom floor. The jolt of the fall woke me up and it took a lot of strength to get up. The symptoms were vicious. When I fainted, the brunt of my weight must of been on my upper left rib cage. My ribs were so sore for a week. It was difficult to walk, breath, blow my nose, or cough.  My health provider recommended a Tylenol regime for pain control so that I could take deep breaths and prevent pneumonia. I had a low grade fever of 99 degrees F for one to two days following the vaccine. During the week that followed I felt periodically very ill, had a constant headache for a day or two, and had extremely foggy thinking and sometimes confusion.  I was very fatigued all week long. I lost my appetite and have still not gained my typical appetite back. Day 8 to 9 is when I was finally feeling closer to normal. Today I feel I may be back to 100%, but my rib cage is still healing, either from a contusion, fracture, or break (likely a contusion).

                                                10 days after the vaccine I developed dizziness, tachycardia, dry mouth,chest pressure, shortness of breath and felt like I was going to pass out, and I had a feeling of extreme doom. I was transported to a clinic. There I had a heart rate of 140 with irregular beats. Continued feeling of doom. An EKG showed ST depression. Symptoms improved with nitroglycerin. The clinic didn&#39;t have the technology to provide care so I was emergently transported again. At that hospital my D-dimer was positive and that lead to a CT Angiogram. This showed a pulmonary embolism. Doppler studies of both legs were negative. I was placed on Heparin for several hours and then switched to Eliquis. About 6 hours after being on Eliquis I had the exact same original symptoms and again nitro was given which helped the symptoms. I was placed back on Heparin for a longer period of time. Once I was anticoagulated I was then switch to Eliquis 10mg BID for 7 days then 5mg BID for 6-9 months. I had a CT Angiogram of the head and neck which was normal. At this time I still have dizziness with standing and intermittently with sitting, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath.

By 4:30PM uncontrollable shakes, felt electric zaps, and very, very cold.  Temperature around 100.9F.  For a couple hours continued shaking and couldn&#39;t get warm.  Finally stopped shaking and then very hot around 8pm, Temperature was 103.5F.  Took Advil and tried to cool down.  Heart rate was around 120bpm and pounding hard for a number of hours.  Couldn&#39;t sleep due to pounding heart.  Finally around 3am the next morning heart rate back to normal and temperature back to 100.9.  Achy throughout the afternoon and night yesterday and this morning.  Feeling much improved at 3pm on 3/10. Temperature 99.5F.

Later in the evening, I took a Tylenol and finally went to sleep. On April 2nd (day after shot), I woke up with fatigue and headache, but fever was gone and I no longer vomited. I took another Tylenol and headache went away.

                                                I was tired after the shot. I slept for 11 hours. I developed something like a cough, but it feels like I am losing my breath at times. It can be painful. It&#39;s like I struggling for air. It does not last long, but it seems to be happening a little more often. I have also experienced a little more film that I have to spit out. The shot triggered my hot flashes again as well.

No treatment was administered. Patient stayed approx 45 minutes after shot and reported she felt fine at the 45 minute mark and was able to leave.

I then went to sleep and on Saturday morning when I woke up my right wrist was itching a lot as well as  my legs, buttocks and hands. All over my body was red and very itchy. I did not sleep due to the itchiness on Saturday night. I developed little red bumps on my entire body. I ate lentils for food but I do not think it was the food. I went to urgent care and saw a doctor who gave me Benadryl, took one dose and then it slowly started to go away.

I slept a large part of the day and felt better when I woke the next day, Monday.  On Monday I felt mostly normal but still had some body aches including a back ache on my left side.  I also had more injection site pain and a red rash about a half dollar in size that was tender to touch and by night time was itchy.

I have never experienced anything like it before. It only lasted a few hours, but it was a very strange feeling. I also had waves of fatigue and felt achey  on and off for two weeks afterward.

                                                Received vaccine at 10am - 20 mins later felt slight prickly itching in both arms between armpit and elbow. Lasted about 10 minutes. Around 4pm the same day I had bad neck pain. And pounding heading, about 1 hour later starting getting chills and fatigued. By 10pm had body aches and muscles pains. I took some Motrin and went to bed. I couldn?t sleep as my mind kept racing. In the morning (day after vaccine) I was feeling worse. All symptoms continued in full force and I couldn?t get out of bed. 10am I was able to drink some Alka seltzer cold medicine and lay back down. I continued to have chills pounding headache bodyaches muscle aches and sweating, but no fever. I felt like I had a bad case of the flu. I?ve continued taking 600 mg Motrin every eight hours and this has helped with the pains and bodyaches. Day 3 woke up feeling much better, noticed a funny smell in my nose, I haven?t been blowing my nose or had any mucus, but I can?t explain the smell. I still have body aches and muscles pains.

Did not sleep well much Friday night due to these symptoms.  Sudden pain in left side of my head about 40 min after the vaccine after I walked to the car and sat down after the 30 min wait. Pain starts as a slow dull ache, increases rather sharply, then goes away quickly. Have this pain several times or so yesterday and today even after taking ibuprofen.   Also pain in my neck with what feels like stress headaches with ibuprofen relieving it.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  Approximately 7 hours after the shot, my body was in a continuous state of needing to stretch. It is like when you wake up in the morning and need to stretch - a whole body stretch- but this was continuous. Over and over and over, right after each other. It went on for many hours. Also, 40 hours after the shot, I noticed a body rash (it could have been there the previous day but I was in bed all day feeling horrible and didn&#39;t notice). I also have a rash on my sacrum area, and I could barely walk with the pain in my bones in that area. As the morning has progressed, I am feeling better in that area but it is still sore. It has been 40 hours after my vaccine and I am still not 100%. Aside from the horrible headache, chills and flu-like symptoms, these are the other side effects I thought need to be reported.

She went to sleep at 1130pm on the day she received her vaccine. At 4am the following morning, she woke up and her whole body was convulsing--the muscles in her arms and legs were shaking, her hands were balled into fists, and her jaw was clenched. She reported that her husband woke up and asked her if she was ok to which we was able to respond, but cannot remember what she said. She reports that her husband said the episode lasted 3-4 minutes, but that she felt like it lasted an hour. When the episode was over, she was spacey and confused. She did not get out of bed. 10 minutes later, a second episode occurred. This time her left arm and right leg began convulsing, but the rest of her body was unaffected. This episode lasted 2-3 minutes and then ended.

Three days after the injections, I came down with flu-like symptoms (achy, brain fog, headache, fatique, chills) This lasted for three days. I started to feel better for a day and then came down with upper respiratory symptoms (sore throat, fatique , stuffy nose, slight cough, brain fog, no energy, loss of appetite)  As of today over two weeks from injection, I&#39;m STILL feeling off.  Symptoms are like having a mild cold with no energy.

I did not sleep at all Monday night. 3/30/2021- felt fine until about 1:00pm when I noticed body aches.  It worsened from then until bedtime.  My hands, feet, and back hurt the worst.  I asked my husband to rub my back, and he gasped when I lifted my shirt.  My entire midback area was covered in a bright red, raised rash with blisters. I took Benadryl and applied betamethasone prescription cream (which I use for poison ivy or bug bites).  My hands also itched, so I used the cream on my hands as well. I was sweating profusely but freezing.  Took my temperature several times but it was never over 98.  I could not sleep well, awake for an hour, asleep for 5 minutes off and on all night. 3/31/2021- I notified my primary care physician of the allergic reaction via the patient portal.  His reply was to take Benadryl, which I was already doing every couple hours.  The itchy back rash remained and more blisters formed.  By the time I finished working, the redness was gone but the blisters remained.  Itching stopped.  Body aches were lessening. 4/1/2021- Rash completely gone, itching completely gone.  Feeling lethargic (possibly due to lack of sleep, but maybe from the vaccine).  One large blister (size of a quarter) and several smaller blisters remain. 4/2/2021- as of now, my left arm is still a bit sore when I raise it over my head.  Main concern is the huge blister that is still on my back.

Also when I laid down for the night, I was accutely aware of my heartbeat, which according to my smartwatch was beating at a rate of 71.  The next morning, I still was experiencing chills, and felt achy/stiff/sore muscles - possibly from tensing up and  shivering all night.  Pain at the injection shot also started the morning after the shot.  By bedtime the day after the shot, the symptoms had eased up.  The next morning the symptoms were gone, except for a little residual injection site discomfort.

Around 11:00pm, I began to feel nauseous. I wasn&#39;t able to sleep, my heart was racing. By 3:30 am I had vomited at least 5 times. Throughout the day on Monday, I was still very cold, nauseous (without vomiting) and somewhat lightheaded. It is now Tuesday and my stomach is still upset. I have not contacted my physician at this time. I have been treating myself with ginger ale, Pepto Bismol, saltines and rest. I&#39;m not 100%, but feeling much better.

                                                Administered vaccine at 12:40pm Pt during administration of vaccine started to pull away but full dose was administered, pt was nervous about the needle. After instructing pt to sit in the post vaccine chair for 15 minutes I noticed visible distress at around 12:50pm. I rushed to her aid and asked her how she was feeling and she reported feeling dizzy. I then helped her out of her chair onto the floor to ensure she would not fall and hit her head - told her to lay supine. I then asked my technician to give me the bp monitor. I then checked her bp and it was below 80/60. I informed her this could be contributing to her dizziness and then asked for consent to help raise her bp. She consented and then I told her I would be lifting her legs in the air to raise her BP. I held her legs in the air for 10 minutes or so and then reassessed her BP and it was 110/48. She started to feel better but reported feeling as if ants were all over her left arm which is where I gave her the vaccine. I assessed once again for angioedema, anaphylaxis, hives, redness, swelling, but didnt see anything. Since the pt was dizzy I did not offer her benadryl liquid but instead offered clairitin. The pt was merely having a panic attack post immunization and said she could swallow tablets and was feeling better. I gave her one clairitn tablet otc. She wanted to sit up so I assisted her to a sitting position while she was on the floor. She sat there for additional ten minutes then moved into a chair and was brought food by her husband because he said she did not have breakfast and thought that could be why she was dizzy. She was not a diabetic so I was not concerned about her BG. She said that this never happened in the past when I reviewed her PCQF form prior to giving her the vaccine. She has had zero history of syncope so this was rare for her. After an additional 10 minutes she had a bp reading of 98/60 and left the store feeling much better

                                                Started with sore arm. During the day following the shot I developed a very low grade fever not going above 99.9. Had severe headache from the left ear to the right ear and going up around my forehead, as if my head was in a vise - all day. Heart was racing all day and night, couldn&#39;t sleep on my side because of it. around 24 hours after the shot I felt chest heaviness, which went away after a few minutes. Face was flushed, and I felt clammy. Went to the bathroom more than normal.  Aches  and joint pain, which weren&#39;t too bad. When I woke up the next day, symptoms were gone, except my arm was still sore and had slight fatigue.

Paramedics were sent to my vehicle, they laid me back, took vitals and assured me that eyesight would return, which it did. They monitored me for 30 minutes and gave me a granola bar which I ate. When I was stable, I drove home.

                                                6 hours after receiving vaccine, I started to get the chills, then body aches, then very intense shaking to go along with the chills and body aches. I felt terrible and the shivering was uncontrollable. I took one 200 mg of ibuprofen at 9 or 10pm, and another one at 11pm. That seemed to help and I fell asleep. When I awoke in the morning, I had a pounding headache. The headache was debilitating and lasted all day. The headache subsided around 6 pm 10/11/21 after taking a 200 mg ibuprofen. All of the above is unlike anything I have ever experienced, even with a fever or flu. It was misery, and I am a good sport, I didn&#39;t expect to have any side effects. These events came on vicious and strong.

                                                I had awful nausea, loud ringing in the ears, I fainted.  The medics provided help, gave me oxygen.  I started having convulsions.   After some time I felt like the lower part of my face went numb and it took tremendous effort to move my lips to talk.  At that point, the medical called the ambulance and sent me to ER, where I was under supervision for some time. I was very weak and nauseated. After I was released, I was very weak could not keep the vertical position.  The next day I was very nauseated, with awful tinnitus, lightheadedness, and weakness. Staying vertical for more than 15 minutes brought fainting symptoms.  I was not able to get out of the house to work.  The next day the fainting symptoms disappeared, everything else continued. Too weak to go to work.  I started moving about only on the 4th day after the shot.  During this event, I did not have any fever or muscle ache, no virus0tyle symptoms.

                                                severe chills came on about 9 hours after dose received. Could not sleep, could not get warm, intense shivering. Minor headache and dull aches throughout the body. Had to climb under an electric blanket, comforter and then another blanket on top to get warm and comfortable. As i drifted in and out of sleep through to the morning, I noticed the chills and shivering dissapating and was able to get some sleep. Awake now, still feeling a headache and flu-like aches to the body. Moving very slow. Arm  not really sore at injection site as it was upon receipt of vaccination.

I was really sick for the next few days. I was tired, too. The reflux made me go to the doctor - a couple weeks after vaccine. Increased symptoms of it real bad. They increased my Omeprazole dose from 20-40 mg. I have loose stools. They added a nose spray as well.  I had had my allergy shots the same week as I had my vaccine.

I woke in the middle of the night in a crying fit because I thought I was going to die I felt soooo bad ! It was worse than any flu Id ever had! My joints hurt, my head wanted to explode , fever of 101.3 , breathing issues , exhaustion, thirsty...this lasted 2 to 3 days. Ive had a couple of days here in beginning of april til now of waking up feeling sick again. It doesnt last all day. Sometimes it just before bedtime. I guess I just feel a bit sick, but that could also be the cancer that ive had since july 2020 that hasnt been treated by a health care system I have?

I woke up with a severe migraine, which isn?t unusual for me, but what is unheard of for me is that my medications aren?t making any difference no matter what I take. So I have an uncontrollable migraine almost to the point of going to the ER. What?s stopping me going is that I do t know what else they can do that I?m not already doing.   2. Low grade fever and chills: not a big deal  3. Severe fatigue to the point that it feels like my brain is ?shutting down?; I feel like I?m passing out. Eventually fave up midday, went back to bed and been sleeping for 8 hours so far   4. Dizziness  5. Extreme nausea - keep thinking I?m going to throw up

                                                Upon injection, medication burned going into arm and lasted about 2 minutes.  I immediately started feeling odd over my entire body, I felt and looked flush,  felt clammy, muscle tightness,  started shaking, felt very nauseated, blood pressure went up and experienced slight swelling in hands.  This lasted 30-45 minutes.  My blood pressure, oxygen saturation level were being monitored.  I left office at around 12:00 pm feeling better.  I felt off the entire day.  At 6:00pm I started with chills, muscles aches and pains.  At 7:30pm I took a shower and went to bed very fatigued, muscles pain and cramping and chills. I took my daily meds of 125mg of Diamox, and 100 mg of Azathioprine.  At 11:30pm I woke up with a 104 fever, sweating, and a lot of muscle cramping in legs and feet.  My head felt like it was going to explode.  My cerebral fluid pressure was up and felt in head and down spin.  I did not rest well and found it difficult to get comfortable all night.  I took an 200 mg of ibuprofen at 12:00am and started to feel some relief.

                                                It started with just a pain in the arm - normal soreness from the injection  site and up the left side of my  neck - but then it spread to the whole upper part of my left arm. It was very , very painful. It wakes me up almost every single night because it hurts. The pain will radiate  - now the pain is more in my arm area and now it&#39;s radiating to my back on on the shoulder blade area on the left side - my  neck is a tiny bit sore right. The soreness in the arm is always consistent but the radiating pain moves around somewhat. I am wondering if they gave me the injection incorrectly.  It doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s  what the description of &#34;COVID ARM.&#34; I don&#39;t have any swelling or redness and I haven&#39;t ever.  I take Aleve every now and then. I called the doctor last week and she told me to wait a couple of weeks and watch it.

I got a headache and pain and stiffness in my neck where I have had nerve pain injections and ablations.

Slowly over the course of the day, I started to experience body aches, chills and headaches.  My left arm where I received the vaccine felt strange.  My fever got up to 100.4.  During the night I had chills.  It felt like my fever broke early in the morning.  I woke up okay and I feel like I could go about my day with no problem.  I no longer have a fever.

I got headachey, alternating between hot and cold chills, a little bit of nausea and extreme tiredness.   This continued for the next 5 days which seemed like they were considered mild reactions according to the CDC website.  Most concerning though, is on day 5, (3/14/21) in the evening as I was getting into bed, I started getting a red, extremely itchy rash on both my arms, my lower back and my upper legs, to the point that I could not sleep because it was so itchy and had to take Benedryl.  I have not changed anything in my diet or in the products I use on my body, so I can only attribute this reaction to this vaccine.  I am still a little itchy on my arms today 3/15/21.   I am also still getting the hot and cold chills and still have a little bit of nausea, not bad, but enough to be &#34;off&#34; certain foods.

I took Benadryl and itch is subsiding. I hope this is the end of side effects!

On 03-16-2021 I woke up and the left side of my shoulder, both knees, both legs and both feet are inflamed.  I also have cramps to both of my shoulders. On Saturday 03-20-2021 when I woke up my right eye was also inflamed but only lasted one day. I have spasms to my calves with leg cramps. I can not sleep at night due to the inflammation.  I went to see my PCP this morning who prescribed a leg cream for the cramps, but I do not know the name. My blood pressure today in the morning was 154/96.  My doctor said it was a reaction to the vaccine.

Around 9:00 pm developed deep, intense body chills that lasted at least 3.5 hours. No fever.  Once the chills were gone, I got an intense headache around the back of my head and in my forehead between my eyebrows.  Difficulty sleeping through these symptoms. Woke up the next day and those symptoms were gone.   Fatigued the next day.  Took a two-hour nap Saturday afternoon and felt normal afterwards.

                                                The patient was screened and was found to have multiple medical allergies but no allergies to any of the components to the Janssen vaccine.  As a precaution, the nurses advised a 30 minute observation.  She received the vaccine without complication and then was being observed and they called me over and the paramedics were also with the patient.  About 17 minutes into observation, the patient started developing chest pressure (4/10), lightheadedness, and nausea.  No shortness of breath, stridor, diaphoresis, back pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, neurologic changes, and any signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis.  She was very anxious.  Further history revealed that the patient had been discharged from the hospital 6 week prior.  She initially went in for an abdominal laproscopic surgery and woke up to having 32 staples closing an abdominal incision.  They had to change from a laproscopic approach to an open abdomen approach due to complications.  She ended up with sepsis and a colostomy and was hospitalized for 2 weeks getting antibiotics.  She lives by herself and was overwhelmed before coming into the clinic for her vaccine.   The paramedics did a 12-lead ECG that showed sinus rhythm.  Vital signs and blood glucose were within normal limits.  The paramedics recommended that she go to the hospital to be checked out but she was very resistant and was tearful because she was traumatized from her previous hospitalization.  After some time, the paramedics convinced her to go to the hospital.  The paramedics hung around the emergency department and then came back once they found out that she was fine.

                                                Started with burning muscles throughout my body. Around 9 PM I started to get a headache. Then chills followed by intenses fever and sweating. All night and through to the next morning I had a high fever, though I didn?t take my temperature. I was achy all over, had an incredibly horrific headache which strong migraine over the counter pills did not help,  I would go back and forth from shivering to sweating (my body would be drenched in sweat) and just feeling miserable. I slept off and on until about noon. Then all symptoms slowly went away. By about 2:00 I was up and around though tired. By early evening I was perfectly fine.

                                                Patient reported to her doctor&#39;s office today with symptoms consistent with Bell&#39;s Palsy.  She stated that the facial symptoms started mid morning today on 4/5/21.  Last week ( week of 3/28 to 4/3) she reports that she felt &#34;weird&#34;.  She felt as if there were cool water running under her skin at all times.  She also states that when anything touches her skin, it feels very cold.  For example, when running her hands under warm water, it feels like ice water on her hands.  When setting her bare arms on her desk, it feels as if they are being set on ice and when her pants rub against her legs it feels as if they are wet and cold.  She also stated that the top 1/3 of her back was tingly and felt as if she had applied Biofreeze to it, but she had put nothing on her back.  Her tip of her tongue feels as if it is &#34;burnt&#34; and she can not tasted anything on the front part of her tongue.  She needs to get things way in the back of her mouth before she can taste them. On 4/3/21 she states that her lips began tingling as if they were having numbing medication wearing off from a dental visit, but she had done nothing different.  On 3/31 her lower back also felt as if it had a pinched nerve.  Today on 4/5/21 she has the Bell&#39;s Palsy on her face that started mid morning and she complains of her nose feeling tingly also.  She also feels as if she is retaining fluid.

Then I started running a fever. I was hot with chills and when I wasn?t under a blanket I was shaking uncontrollably. I took ibuprofen which helped a little. Ended up taking an Ativan to sleep. The next morning I felt like I had the flu. Still feverish with a deep cough. Groggy, lethargic and tired. Took a two hour nap around 4. Starting to feel better but I?m exhausted and very irritable.

One other thing that happened that may not be related is that my secondary implant eye socket became very sore and swelled up.  It could of been for another reason but the timing was uncanny.  I am feeling fine now and none of my reactions were that troubling.  I have experienced about 3 times a sudden feeling in my  body that made me think I wonder if that was the vaccine but I am feeling great now and all is good.  Thank you so very much for all the research and production of these life saving vaccines.

After 4 hours the fever subsided as quickly as it came on and my heart returned to normal functioning. When the fever subsided I was left with a severe headache for approximately 6 hours. Once the headache subsided I felt lethargic and foggy headed. On the second night (3/14/2021) the fever returned but was only 100.4 degrees. I took an Aleve before going to bed and when I woke up this morning I felt back to normal.

                                                At about 23 minutes broke out in a cold sweat. At 26 minutes, became hoarse (always my first symptom of anaphylaxis). Progressed to coughing and feeling a lump in my throat and then tightness in my chest. My blood pressure elevated to 152/100. At that point I self administered epi pen and paramedics called 911. This provided relief but after about 5 to 10 minutes the tightness in my chest and the feeling I couldn?t get a deep breath began to return and the paramedics administered two puffs of an albuteral inhaler and transported me to the hospital. At the ER, they did an EKG, started an IV and administered fluids, prednisone and Benadryl. I was discharged about 90 -120 minutes later with a prescription for 3 days of prednisone (50mg) and instructions to continue to take 25 mg oral Benadryl every 4 hours.  The next morning my face and chest were red and looked like I was sunburned. My face was also swollen.

Almost like something effected the muscle, I didn&#39;t say anything and went to the wait room I mentioned it before I left and they said it sounded like a migraine and I went home.  When I raise my face on the right side of my eyebrow area feels like I have spasms. When I got home it moved to my cheek area as well and felt strange.  I got a rash on my right cheek that evening and a super bad headache. I took a Benadryl and went to sleep. I didn&#39;t have a fever.  By the morning the rash was gone, the only thing that bothered me was my eyebrow area ( muscle area) I went to the Dr the following day and she said it sounded like it was my sinuses. Prior to this I was having allergy / sinus issues.

After the first 24 hours, my breathing became more shallow, and I had an increased hunger to add to the body aches.  I felt as if I had the flu.   At 36 hours after injection, I started having a head ache that caused me to be dizzy upon standing. I am making this report 46 hours after and I still have a slight headache and some nausea/excess saliva.

                                                Received injection on Sunday. Monday was nauseated and had chest pressure.  Nausea and CP came in waves and occurred about 10 times. Then stopped.   Felt &#34;off&#34; for 4 days.  Felt fine on Friday and through Wed 3/23/21 until 9:10 PM.  Developed visual changes in left peripheral bilat.  Appeared like waves in an arc.  Then began to not be able to breathe.  I had to tell myself to breathe.  Called squad, arrived 9:45pm.  BP 170/110, HR 118. By 10pm, the visual changes disappeared BUT developed chest pressure in same area as the MOnday after the vaccine.  Then became extremely nauseated, almost vomiting.  Nause came in waves for next 6 hours until it calmed down.  Then returned Wed am for several hours, again in waves along with hollow chest feeling and pain. Continued with headache off and on with brain fog the remainder of Wednseday 3/23/21.  Discussed with hospitalist at Hospital and was told to report it to the CDC as likely an adverse effect to the vaccine.  Was still in the 14 day window.     Thank you,  RN, PhD, MSN, MS, BSN

It wasn&#39;t like a sudden cramp that just went away after a few minutes. Nothing I did seemed to help, walking around, stretching,.  It got progressively worse.  This started around 9 pm.  I took three (200 mg) ibuprofen at about 10:30  p.m.. That didn&#39;t help much, unable to lay down and sleep,  too uncomfortable in any position. . Finally around midnight I took a muscle relaxant, and that  worked. When I woke up this morning, I felt fine.  No muscle pain or aches.

                                                Difficulty taking deep breaths, dizziness that felt more like vertigo (the floor and ceiling spinning whenever I stood or sat up), exhausted to the point that I could not sit up without falling asleep.  I slept 14hrs straight for two days after the shot.  Tired after walking down the driveway and back.  Entire body aching with excruciating pain but not the left arm where the shot was taken.  Headaches were bad as well.  No appetite.  The 3rd day afterwards I felt better but still very tired.  The 4th day still tired but better.  Tylenol, caffeinated coffee and lots of water seem to help me get through this.  The fifth day afterward, I am almost 100%  but dealing with running nose and eyes which may not be related to the shot.

I had a fever, chills so violent that I made the bed shake - lasted for hours; severe headache that triggered a migraine, exhaustion, and nausea.  It&#39;s 2 days later and I still feel terrible.  My husband gave me a tylenol PM that night and the next day as the headache was a full blown migraine, I took naratriptain.   I still have a slight headache but want to avoid taking additional medicine if possible.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine, I had stinging pain spreading like a wasp sting (to which I am allergic) traveling down my left arm. Within a half hour, sharp muscle cramps took place simultaneously on top of the &#34;wave&#34; of sting like pain. These waves of cramping pain changed in location, but were strongest in my arms and legs. Between these waves, sharp pinching nerve pain happens in specific spots which could be anywhere including scalp and between toes. I had one good day with little pain. Other days are not so bad if I keep ibuprofen consistently in my system. It has been 12 days, and these pains have lessened but not stopped.  The remaining pains are more of the sharp isolated nerve pains.  I have not had any flu like symptoms, and I&#39;ve had very little pain at the injection site.  I have not been able to work much of the 12 days since the shot. I worry that the nerve pain may not go away.

                                                I felt fine immediately after the injection - just a little pain in the arm where I got the injection and when raising my arm. By 6:30 pm I was achy all over and my legs were aching a lot. When I went to bed around 8:00, I hurt all over (achy and flu-like feeling, but no fever). I dozed off and on and about midnight when I woke up, I had a very rapid heartbeat. This went on all night and into the morning. It was hard to get any sleep at all. When I&#39;d get up to go to the bathroom, I was slightly dizzy and unsteady on my feet. After I got up at 6:30 am, the highest my heartrate got was 113, then it finally began going down. I was still hurting all over, felt extremely tired, and now had fever - 99.8. The fever lasted off and on all day and into the next night. I was also very nauseated all day and I felt extremely bloated. I also had a bad headache. When I woke up on Friday, my fever and the headache was gone, but I felt extremely tired and weak and still nauseated. I slept most of the day and I still ached all over, but not as much. My lymph nodes were also swollen. On Friday afternoon, I walked up to the mailbox and I was winded and unsteady. On Saturday, I felt a little better, but was still extremely tired. By Saturday night, all the aches, pains and headache were back and I didn&#39;t sleep well at all. I rested most of Sunday and felt a little better Sunday evening. The aches and pains were going away, but I was still very tired and exhausted. I felt the same way when I woke up on Monday morning. It seemed like the vaccination made the aches and pains I normally had with Fibromyalgia about three times as bad as usual. And I was still very bloated feeling all over. By Monday afternoon the nausea finally went away. By Monday afternoon I was feeling a little better, but still tired. On Tuesday I felt better still and I noticed that I wasn&#39;t bloated as much. It seemed like I was getting back to normal.

                                                My left arm started to sting immediately after getting the shot, then the stinging subsided.  My left arm started to hurt later in the day and I had pain all the way down my left arm and left side of my chest. This pain throughout my left side was not helped by Ibuprofen and  made sleep very hard.  I had intermittent sharp pain in my neck, shoulder, and left arm for days.  The injection site turned red, hot, and a raised area the size of a silver dollar appeared  and was med-red in color for about 8 days.  The color is better/ almost normal as of today, but still a hard lump under the skin and a bit itchy.  This has caused pain throughout my back and shoulders since I got the shot....but it has not been activity limiting.  I had a slight bit of nausea for a couple of days as well.  My husband had his shot just after mine and experienced  Chills , headache, and nausea at about 9:00 P.M.  His chills subsided at about 3:00 A.M.  He continued with the headache for another day/ fatigue for 2 days/ and nausea for about 5 days.  He has also had tingling in his left arm (about 7 days)  and a funny tingling on his tongue for about a week.

                                                Immediately Saturday: spacey and throat feels strange; afternoon: body is cold/tired. Sunday: felt great! lots of energy until during a walk at 3pm started to feel spacey (hands feel weird) and spiked a short term fever. Tired and cold. Monday: tired, bottom of lungs burning like I inhaled campfire smoke for a week straight, stumbling over words. Tues: tired, more burning lungs but sensation moving to mid chest (NOT heartburn), feeling like I needed to cough but nothing in lungs, still tired, still struggling with full sentences, irritable. Weds: felt hot but temp was below normal, lungs burning. Took Covid test (negative), incredibly tired, got the spacey feeling and hands felt weird-lasted 30 mins. Thurs: tired, irritable, left side hurt, started having to clear my throat every 20-30 minutes, cold. Fri: still tired, felt like I needed to cough but didn&#39;t reduce the pressure in chest/burnin/aching. Slept 14 hours. Sat: woke up feeling awful. Short of breath, clearing throat all day. Went to urgent clinic. Lab/chest x-ray and EKG all negative. Dr:&#34;Nothing we can do for you. This vaccine is too  new and you are likely having a reaction. Come see us if it gets worse.&#34; I almost cried. When he had me take 4-6 deep breaths to check my lungs with his stethoscope I almost passed out. Now I&#39;m home stuck on the couch under an electric blanket feeling like crap with no relief in sight. Hoping no one else has this ever.

Due to a prior reaction to vicodin I was asked to wait 30 minutes. I began reading on my phone, and after 10 minutes passed I noticed I was becoming very short of breath and was having difficulty mentally focusing on what I was reading. As this was not an expected reaction, I decided to wait a bit before honking my horn to request assistance. After 5-7 minutes, the feeling went away and my breathing and concentration returned to normal. I waited an additional 30 minutes just in case, but have been fine for the past 6 hours without even a sore arm. Had anything been in bloom in the surrounding area, I would have presumed rolling down my window allowed me to breathe pollen that triggered my allergies, but it is still too early in the spring for that. Weather was 53 F, sunny and dry.

Body aches started about 5pm, then chills/shivering , headache, and low grade fever of 100.6 by 8pm.  I slept  for 11 hours which is not normal for me  and woke up groggy &amp; still sore.  Checked my temperature, 99.3  all afternoon. I took a whirlpool bath with epsom salt and body aches subsided quite a bit. Felt ok rest of evening &amp; slept fine Sunday night.  Still feeling a bit sluggish today (Monday).

I got up and walked back over to my waiting chair and my Husband got up and received his vaccine.    Besides the pain in my left arm,  I started feeling weird tingling sensations and spaced out.  When my Husband sat back down next to me,  my stomach had a burning sensation and I felt slightly nauseated.  Then I felt like I was about to faint.  My Husband and the Staff kept me from falling, The Staff brought ice packs to put on my neck.  They said I turned white and profusely sweat.   I don&#39;t remember all of it, my Husband filled in the blanks.  I started feeling better and we left @4:30.

I got the vaccine at 9am.  around 4pm that afternoon i started feeling sick.  by 7:30pm I was in bed thinking I was going die!   By midnight, I got up and tried to walk to the stairs but i was to weak to walk.  I could not sleep.  I was up for 36 hours!  I was nauseous, dizzy, weak, exhausted.  Every inch of my body had pain!!!  I was tingling all over.  I  had the chills until midnight.  My heart would race and then stop... then race again... I was having difficulty breathing!  I tried standing up but I couldn&#39;t.  I would have driven myself to the emergency room but I couldn&#39;t walk.  by noon the next day, my heart regulated, I was able to breath easier.  I was still exhausted and full of pain and tingling.  Today, I still have some pain, but no tingling.

                                                After getting the shot that afternoon  at 3:00 a.m. I woke up in a flu state of chills, fever, headache, achiness.  The headache lasted a solid 24 hours almost to the point of vomiting even while taking 4 tylenol every 4 hours then my stomach was empty so I ate a few crackers, but that next night it was hard to go to sleep.  At night I suddently realized my forehead seemed larger than normal!  It really felt bigger and swollen  so I massaged it and could feel my layers of skin/dermis moving around I beleived it was the serum from the shot from all the prone position I was in for so long laying in bed.  Thankfully the next day all syptoms went away gradually and by the third day I was back to normal....at least I THINK my forehead has returned to normal so far as I can see or feel.

When I tried to stand up I fell back on the bed.  Had to sit still for 10 minutes until the spinning stopped.  Moved carefully for a few hours.  Ran a half marathon.  After the half, if I turned my head quickly, I felt the vertigo return but it was not as bad as when I woke up.
