                                                She got the vaccine, no symptoms until about 10 days later on Tuesday 4/6/21 in the early morning she woke up around 3:00 AM and felt like she had been in a bar fight, had painful arm around vaccine site.  She could not go back to sleep that night.  The next night she went to sleep and everything was fine, no reactions.  She slept on both sides of the arm up until the 10th day, and had no problems.   The following night again got up to go to the bathroom and felt a pain in the left arm, but still had painful arm during the next day, ache going up through the top part of the arm where injection was, going across her shoulder area and into her back.  The pain comes and goes as a dull ache during the day.  The pain mainly occurs at night on the shoulder that she got the injection.  Last night the same thing happened again and she slept a couple of hours, still having sensations there.  When she got up had the big pain again, and filled a hot water bottle which seemed to help.  Right  now, 4/12/21 she still has an ache in the arm, but during the night it feels like somebody is punching the arm, which has been going on for 5-6 days.   Deep breathing also radiates the pain to the shoulder area as well.   Did not take anything for the symptoms other than the hot water bottle.

She wanted to go straight home.  When we got home she reported that the numbness had been felt in her head and tongue and it was a very weird feeling.  She was numb on her entire left side.  It seemed to resolve after a while.  She is still very tired and has a low heart rate, but normal blood oxygenation.  There is no visible swelling or reaction at the vaccine site. She still has some slight numbness on the left side.  She may call the doctor tomorrow if there is still some concern.

                                                Patient had been working all day in her flower gardens.  At 4:30 p.m. she felt like she had double vision and difficulty talking.  She does not remember much of what happened after that, but her husband said she had sudden onset of right arm weakness, leg weakness and drooping of the right side of her face.  Denies having numbness.  He immediately called 911 and EMS took her the Hospital.  She had a CT scan of the head that was negative.  When she arrived at the emergency room her symptoms had resolved, but she had recurrent episode of her symptoms in the emergency room with an NIH score of 5 scoring a point for level of consciousness, best language, and dysarthria and 2 points for facial droop.  She was given tPA and her symptoms resolved.  A CT angio of her head and neck did not show any large thrombus.  She was transferred for ongoing care and neurology evaluation.  Neuro deficits resolved.  Patient was discharged the second day after the event on Aspirin, Plavix and Lipitor.  Hospitalist (Dr) asked me to file VAERS report given recent Janssen vaccine administration.

Daughter finally convinced patient to see a doctor. Md prescribed her a cough medication. She still felt bad for another 2-3 weeks, so she finally went to the emergency room where she diagnosed with blood clots in the legs and the lungs. She staying in hospital approx. 4-5 days before being released.

                                                Eleven days after getting the shot, my mother in law was experiencing severe back pain and was not able to get comfortable or sleep at night. Before we could take her to see a doctor, she fell while trying to get out of bed at 7am the next morning. She had trouble getting up and exerted a lot of energy trying on her own. She called for my husband and I to help her get up. I grabbed her around the waist and my husband held her walker for her as support. Upon rising (mostly of her own ability) she was so exhausted that we had her sit on her walker and rest a moment. My husband went to check on her twice over the next 15-20 minutes, but when he returned again she was showing classic stroke signs and EMS was called. They arrived quickly and agreed. She was taken immediately to the ER, where they also agreed that it looked like a stroke. She was admitted as they continued to run tests, but she continued to decline more and more each day at the hospital losing motor skills and ability to speak. She was not able to move her right side at all and the left side was fidgety and had uncontrollably flailing that left her bruises on her arm and leg. She was also excessively sleepy. After loads of testings and images, the MRIs finally showed that the brain stem was extremely inflamed and it was an auto-immune response. By this time, she was already a vegetable in the ICU ward under incubation, IVs and a feeding tube. They continued to run more tests and brought in infectious diseases, but they ultimately said her body was fighting an infection that she did not have. They attempted a hemoglobin treatment with an oncologist to shut down her immune system but never consulted with her renal doctor, even through they were very concerned about renal failure.  She could not complete the treatment and only received 4 out of the 5 doses they wanted to give her because of her kidney counts. They said that the auto-immune attack was very aggressive and they could not shut it down. In the early morning of 4/28/21, they finally contacted her kidney doctor and she was put on dialysis as a last effort to try to save her, but it was too late and all her organs were failing. She passed at 1:56 pm. Patient was homebound during the pandemic and did not leave the house unless she was visiting her doctor&#39;s office. My husband and I have limited contact at our jobs, as we work in small offices, and our children (that also lived with her) were being schooled virtually. There is nothing that I know that could have caused her immune system to go into overdrive, except for the vaccine that was administered less than 2 weeks (which is considered the time frame for vaccine immunity) prior to her symptoms.

Jumped in a hot shower for 15 minutes and that went away.  I thought maybe my blood pressure had dropped too low; had same reaction when first put on too much blood pressure lowering medication.  Or sometimes allergy makes the blood pressure drop. For 24 hours after that I was on the couch or in bed lying down;  brain hurt(BAD headache), stiff neck, a big effort to lift my head off the pillow so I didn&#39;t unless I had to go to the bathroom.  I laid back down asap due to slight nausea.  No appetite. Whites of eyes were uniformly pink, eyes glassy.  3/23  Sore spot  to the touch on left temple just above the eyebrow.

Patient states she has been on the ground in the room for 3 days, she was found covered in feces.  Alert and oriented x4 however intermittently appears confused and has varying history.  She does not know how she got on the ground, however denies fall or syncope.  No significant current complaints.  Slightly tachycardic and febrile, slightly hypertensive, exam without any significant acute findings, no obvious skin source of ulcer or infection, no focal neurological deficits, no pain.  Initiated aggressive fluid hydration and sepsis work-up.  EKG appears normal with no signs of ischemia or arrhythmia.  Labs show slightly elevated troponin, low magnesium, metabolic/lactic acidosis.  VBG relatively normal.  Urine negative for infection chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia, no clinical signs or symptoms to identify source of infection.  Nothing to suggest meningitis at this time.  CT head is negative.  Unclear source of fever however empirically treated with antibiotics and fluids.  Patient remains hemodynamically stable with no hypotension.  She did arrive slightly hypoxic and with increased respiratory rate however clear lung sounds and no indications of heart failure, COPD/asthma.  CT chest without evidence of pulmonary embolism, focal pneumonia, or fluid overload.  Respiratory status possibly related to compensation for metabolic acidosis that is likely due to lack of fluid intake due to being on the ground.  CK is normal and kidney function is normal.  Consulted medicine for admission for further evaluation and treatment.  Cardiology was also consulted for NSTEMI, agrees with current plan.   per H&amp;P 4/28/21:   Altered mental status (R41.82): Etiology is not clear.

                                                Awoke 3rd day after vaccination with severe positional vertigo or similar disorder - felt when I simply turned my head on pillow.  It was as if I was falling in space, especially my head. Could  not sit up without feeling terrible. Lessened somewhat during day but could not move head without feeling vertigo/dizziness.  Unable to eat without nausea and vomiting.  That was 04/09/21. On 04/10 and 04/11 it was difficult to arise from bed without feeling very dizzy. But after getting up very slowly without moving head, I could move slowly to use  bathroom, get a little food, etc.  Today, 04/12, still had to arise from bed very slowly, trying not to move head to avoid weird dizzy type feeling.  Have been able to eat, get dressed and leave the house carefully. Try not to move head too much and move rather slowly.

                                                I was walking in the airport and I just fell for no reason. I went down slow. I was able to get up on my own, but I have no idea what made me fall. I went to my daughter&#39;s house and I was trying to climb the stairs to get to her place, but I couldn&#39;t even bring my leg up to step on the first step. I had to physically pull myself up the stairs by my arms. I felt like I lost my strength. I lost control of my bladder. I went to the doctor to have a urinalysis done and there was not an infection. I also lost my balance and would often have chills. Anytime I would start walking it would feel like I was drunk with how I couldn&#39;t walk straight. I felt fatigued during this time as well. During time that I would try to speak, I would say something in a sentence that had nothing to do with the topic of conversation. I was thinking I may have had a stroke, but when I went to the doctor and had a CT scan, a brain MRI and blood work done, everything came back normal. All of this lasted three weeks and then just all went away. My doctor diagnosed me with post COVID viral illness, but I never had COVID. She said it&#39;s similar to a viral meningitis.

                                                A week following my mothers vaccination, she became increasing fatigued. On day 10 following her vaccination she went to bed and had to be helped to her room, this was unusual. She remained in bed for 19-20 hours a day for three days. I called all of her doctors, all of whom she had just been seen by, routine CT scans performed, blood work done, and visit with her neurologist. Her oncologist suggested we seek a hospice evaluation, even though her CT scans showed that her cancer had only slight growth, nothing to be concerned about. Her primary care office ordered the hospice evaluation and it was performed on Thursday, 3/18. They said ?she may just be having a bad week following her vaccination? and ?lets revisit this the following week?. her condition continued to deteriorate significantly over the next few days, so much that she began sleeping 21?23 hours a day. On the following Tuesday, 3/23, she was admitted into the hospice system. Now, four weeks later, we are in the final weeks of her life. She refuses food and water now, and her nurse says that it won?t be much longer. She went from a relatively healthily, senior woman, with underlying health issues, none of which presented her imminent demise, to dying at home within weeks of receiving her J&amp;J vaccine. I have no idea if he demise is in anyway related to her vaccine, but thought it was important to report her symptoms.

The patient was registered through phone for the J&amp;J vaccination homebound vaccinations on 4/9.   J&amp;J was notified with anonymous patient info.  Follow up with the son was provided by, PharmD BCGP, who consulted with CDC recommendations: ?The patient may experience the same local and systemic adverse reactions as either mRNA/VV vaccine.  Furthermore the patient may experience a higher rate of adverse reactions which should be monitored closely.  The patient/family should notify the patient?s health care provider about the case.  No additional COVID-19 vaccines should be provided to this patient.?  FD will be following up with the patient and son tomorrow (day after the injection).
