She wanted to go straight home.  When we got home she reported that the numbness had been felt in her head and tongue and it was a very weird feeling.  She was numb on her entire left side.  It seemed to resolve after a while.  She is still very tired and has a low heart rate, but normal blood oxygenation.  There is no visible swelling or reaction at the vaccine site. She still has some slight numbness on the left side.  She may call the doctor tomorrow if there is still some concern.

Jumped in a hot shower for 15 minutes and that went away.  I thought maybe my blood pressure had dropped too low; had same reaction when first put on too much blood pressure lowering medication.  Or sometimes allergy makes the blood pressure drop. For 24 hours after that I was on the couch or in bed lying down;  brain hurt(BAD headache), stiff neck, a big effort to lift my head off the pillow so I didn&#39;t unless I had to go to the bathroom.  I laid back down asap due to slight nausea.  No appetite. Whites of eyes were uniformly pink, eyes glassy.  3/23  Sore spot  to the touch on left temple just above the eyebrow.

I experienced chills all night.    By noon today (3/21/21) I have no more symptoms and feel back to normal.
