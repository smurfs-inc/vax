She could not go back to sleep that night.  The next night she went to sleep and everything was fine, no reactions.  She slept on both sides of the arm up until the 10th day, and had no problems.   The following night again got up to go to the bathroom and felt a pain in the left arm, but still had painful arm during the next day, ache going up through the top part of the arm where injection was, going across her shoulder area and into her back.  The pain comes and goes as a dull ache during the day.  The pain mainly occurs at night on the shoulder that she got the injection.  Last night the same thing happened again and she slept a couple of hours, still having sensations there.  When she got up had the big pain again, and filled a hot water bottle which seemed to help.  Right  now, 4/12/21 she still has an ache in the arm, but during the night it feels like somebody is punching the arm, which has been going on for 5-6 days.   Deep breathing also radiates the pain to the shoulder area as well.   Did not take anything for the symptoms other than the hot water bottle.

She wanted to go straight home.  When we got home she reported that the numbness had been felt in her head and tongue and it was a very weird feeling.  She was numb on her entire left side.  It seemed to resolve after a while.  She is still very tired and has a low heart rate, but normal blood oxygenation.  There is no visible swelling or reaction at the vaccine site. She still has some slight numbness on the left side.  She may call the doctor tomorrow if there is still some concern.

Jumped in a hot shower for 15 minutes and that went away.  I thought maybe my blood pressure had dropped too low; had same reaction when first put on too much blood pressure lowering medication.  Or sometimes allergy makes the blood pressure drop. For 24 hours after that I was on the couch or in bed lying down;  brain hurt(BAD headache), stiff neck, a big effort to lift my head off the pillow so I didn&#39;t unless I had to go to the bathroom.  I laid back down asap due to slight nausea.  No appetite. Whites of eyes were uniformly pink, eyes glassy.  3/23  Sore spot  to the touch on left temple just above the eyebrow.

                                                Awoke 3rd day after vaccination with severe positional vertigo or similar disorder - felt when I simply turned my head on pillow.  It was as if I was falling in space, especially my head. Could  not sit up without feeling terrible. Lessened somewhat during day but could not move head without feeling vertigo/dizziness.  Unable to eat without nausea and vomiting.  That was 04/09/21. On 04/10 and 04/11 it was difficult to arise from bed without feeling very dizzy. But after getting up very slowly without moving head, I could move slowly to use  bathroom, get a little food, etc.  Today, 04/12, still had to arise from bed very slowly, trying not to move head to avoid weird dizzy type feeling.  Have been able to eat, get dressed and leave the house carefully. Try not to move head too much and move rather slowly.

                                                A week following my mothers vaccination, she became increasing fatigued. On day 10 following her vaccination she went to bed and had to be helped to her room, this was unusual. She remained in bed for 19-20 hours a day for three days. I called all of her doctors, all of whom she had just been seen by, routine CT scans performed, blood work done, and visit with her neurologist. Her oncologist suggested we seek a hospice evaluation, even though her CT scans showed that her cancer had only slight growth, nothing to be concerned about. Her primary care office ordered the hospice evaluation and it was performed on Thursday, 3/18. They said ?she may just be having a bad week following her vaccination? and ?lets revisit this the following week?. her condition continued to deteriorate significantly over the next few days, so much that she began sleeping 21?23 hours a day. On the following Tuesday, 3/23, she was admitted into the hospice system. Now, four weeks later, we are in the final weeks of her life. She refuses food and water now, and her nurse says that it won?t be much longer. She went from a relatively healthily, senior woman, with underlying health issues, none of which presented her imminent demise, to dying at home within weeks of receiving her J&amp;J vaccine. I have no idea if he demise is in anyway related to her vaccine, but thought it was important to report her symptoms.

                                                86-year-old spanish speaking female brought into the ED with concerns of slurred speech and confusion that was noted at 3 PM on 4/8.  Patient&#39;s last known well was at 10 AM on 4/8.  GCS on arrival 15.  NIH SS 2 recorded at 18: 12 (for mild right-sided facial droop and mild dysarthria).   In the EMS blood glucose was 122, no meds were given.  Patient is not on any anticoagulation.  Patient&#39;s blood pressure was elevated at 233/78.  Patient denying any headaches, nausea, vomiting.  Per the family no focal neurologic deficits noted except for dysarthria which was improved during the ED visit.   Neurology contacted in the ED for stroke code.  Patient outside of TPA window.  CT head was negative.  CT head negative for acute intracranial infarction.  Chest x-ray negative for any acute cardiopulmonary findings.  Patient was started on nicardipine drip in the ED with the blood pressure reduced to 145/70, then turned off.  CBC showed mild leukocytosis (14.8) likely reactive.  CMP unremarkable.  PT/INR was also obtained.   After discussion with neurology given the CT head and CTA head and neck, CTP negative are reassuring for low concern of stroke. ASA 325 once was given. However neurology does recommend an admission for further evaluation with an MRI for notably rule out stroke.  After discussion with family and the physicians the patient refused admission.

Furthermore the patient may experience a higher rate of adverse reactions which should be monitored closely.  The patient/family should notify the patient?s health care provider about the case.  No additional COVID-19 vaccines should be provided to this patient.?  FD will be following up with the patient and son tomorrow (day after the injection).
