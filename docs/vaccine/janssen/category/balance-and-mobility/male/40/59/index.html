                                                On March 11th at around 10pm I experienced severe shaking, fever, headache and delirium. The next day I improved but had a fever on and off of 99.1. I felt like I was stable, but felt dizziness increasing, and was lethargic through the weekend.   Then on Monday the 15th, I had a noticeable cramp in my right abdomen. At around 8pm CST I began feeling like I needed to burp and that I had GI problems.   The problems increased that night at around 10pm I had pain where the cramp started. Two hours later I started throwing up because of the pain and feeling of too much air inside of me. I could not stop vomiting after 2 hours so went to the Hospital ED at around 2:30 AM Tuesday the 16th.   I was admitted after a CT scan showed and white cell counts confirmed and infection and drastically enlarged appendix. I was diagnosed with an appendicitis and they immediately scheduled me for surgery.

They gave me an aspirin, drew multiple blood samples, performed two EKGs, and a chest x-ray. They could find nothing wrong with me. After about an hour at the hospital the symptoms begin getting better, and I was discharged approximately four hours later.

Once on the freeway I felt dizzy.  This came on me very fast.  I thought I better get off at the next exit.. but instantly blacked out.  While unconscious I struck another vehicle going approximatley 65mph, rolled my vehicle on its side, skidded, then rolled back upright.  I awoke to my car spun sideways on the freeway, paramedics, and fire dept working the wreck from my window, and no recollection of what happend.  It felt instantaneous to me.    I ate a breakfast of granola, yoguirt.  I hydrated before the shot.  I even took extra Vitamin C.

                                                Got injected, didn?t hurt much. Was told to wait 15 minutes in case of reaction. They walked away and left me sitting in a chair in a public space with everyone else who was waiting. I texted my wife to check in, when I started tearing up and crying for no real reason, then started feeling nauseous so I closed my eyes.   Suddenly I felt like I had been given a shot of adrenaline out of nowhere so I?m just trying to figure out if it?s nerves or a physiological response to something. I?m trying to control my breathing but having a hard time breathing.   Then the fever hit. The most intense flash of heat. I was hyperventilating. I couldn?t open my eyes or move or make a sound, I could just sit there struggling to breathe. My phone was in my hand and I couldn?t lift it. I just simply didn?t have the strength or energy to move.   At some point I legit thought I was about to die. I managed to angle my wrist so I could check my heart rate with my watch. It was 47bpm.   I was fading away but I made myself get control of my breathing and forced myself to take long deep slow breaths. It hurt, and I felt like passing out, but I kept doing it.   Fever turned into chills and then I soaked through my jeans and T-shirt in under a minute. I was finally thinking clearly and breathing and getting oxygen. Everyone else near me was fine.   Nobody checked on me the entire time including the 3 people who sat there and watched me suffer through this.  I told the pharmacist about my reaction and asked if it was normal and didn?t receive any indication that I should be concerned, so I went home since I felt better.   It wasn?t until my friend pointed out that this sounds like anaphylaxis that I thought I should report it. So here I am. Hopefully I?ll be okay.

Also have horrible vertigo, feel like  I am spinning all the time and it has not gone away.  I also had SOB and my heart was pounding for one week. My PCP told me that I should wait it out that it was probably my body revolving against the vaccine and I was prescribed a medication for my headache and vertigo. My ear were also checked with an ENT and I have no inner ear problems. I can say that my symptoms came from the J&amp;J vaccine.

                                                April 17th, felt chest pain and fatigue and shortness of breath. After about two weeks of it, I went to ER on the 26th. I was diagnosed with blood clot on my heart.  I spent a week at the hospital Heparin blood thinners and antibiotics  - discharged on May 2, 2021. They sent me home with Warfarin regiment. I am still on that.  I still have some days where I&#39;m good but some days, I can barely stand and get out of bed due to short of breath, fatigue but not as much chest pain. I think the blood thinners are working. I just have to take it easy and make sure to have some calm days.  It  could take weeks to months to have the blood clot totally dissolve from the system.

At about 10:30pm I started feeling sick, fever of 99.6, muscle and joint pain, chills, dizziness, weakness. Left arm where I got injected also felt like it was falling asleep at some point when it shouldn&#39;t have been based on how I was positioned. I finally took an ibuprofen so I could sleep around 2:30am, and felt better a couple hours later or so. Today so far I feel fine but my resting heart rate is about 30 beats higher than normal so I&#39;m still responding to vaccine.  I think overall my symptoms aren&#39;t out of the ordinary, just way stronger than I was expecting. I felt miserable.

                                                I got the vaccine at about 12:55pm. About ten minutes after getting the vaccine, while sitting in a chair, I began to get tunnel vision and felt extremely tired. I broke out in a cold sweat all over my body. I began to lose my vision like I was fainting and I momentarily blacked out or dozed off, then came back awake. I started to get tunnel vision again for a minute, then it faded away. Then I continued sweating for a minute and then it faded away. After a couple minutes I felt fine again. I sat for another several minutes then left at 1:15 feeling ok with just a sore shoulder.

He turned pale and fell sideways off chair onto floor lowering himself with his knee. He did not bump his head, he was sweating profusely, but did not lose consciousness. I yelled to the tech to call 911. Patient was sitting on floor.  He said he did not eat much all day. He was alert and talking. He said he fainted when his wife had their baby. We gave his some orange juice. The paramedics arrived 8 minutes later and checked his vitals. In the meantime we called his wife. Paramedics checked his BP, glucose and questioned patient. Patient refuse to go with paramedics. Wife came and paramedics released him to her.

About five minutes in, another patient who received the vaccine together with patient told us the patient had fainted. Patient was slumped over to the side when I came to check on patient. I called the patient a few times and patient started to come to. I asked the patient how he was feeling and if he had any difficulty breathing to assess for anaphylactic shock. Patient was breathing normal, but was sweating and a bit confused. Patient reported feeling dizzy. I explained to patient that he fainted for a few minutes and instructed to sit as I did not feel comfortable having patient lay down in the state he was in. Patient was given water and a fan to help cool him down and legs elevated (patient reported feeling much better with the fan blowing on him). Patient sat at the pharmacy for over 30 minutes before heading to the bathroom. At this point, patient were no longer dizzy and I instructed him to get up slowly and assessed that patient was no longer dizzy before letting him go to the bathroom.

At about the 17 minute mark patiently suddenly fainted in his chair for 15-30 seconds. He then began to vomit and woke up in the process. Once he fully came back to, he said he felt remarkedly better and no longer felt light-headed or clammy. Following this episode he reported feeling back to normal and that he had just ate a large breakfast before coming in for the shot, but did not feel bad in any way anymore. We observed for another 30 minutes and patient showed no further sign of issues. He was released with his wife.

I woke up again in a few hours with worse chills, minor headache, and minor joint pain. I took over the counter medication, felt a little better and went back to sleep after a few hours. I woke up around 4am to use the bathroom and still had the worse chills, sweats, minor headache and was very dizzy. I decided to lay down on a rug rather than try to make it back to my bed and laid awake for a few hours again I woke up again in a few hours a little better and repeated everything until Sunday night when all my symptoms were very mild. I eat and drank water regularly and took over the counter acetaminophen a few times.

                                                Injection Friday.  No issues Friday, Saturday, or Sunday other than slight pain at the injection site and slight body aches on Sunday.  Monday morning at approximately 0230 i woke up to what i can only describe as lightning pains in my legs.  It was a very intense pain shooting from my upper thighs to my knees and slightly bending around to the top of my calves on the outside of the leg.  Monday all day i did not feel well.  Had a dull pain in center of chest, and my left arm from the shoulder blade to the elbow had what i can only describe as a slight warm sensation.  I was also very &#34;foggy&#34; and light headed.  On Tuesday the pain in my chest worsened.  My left arm kept going numb (and still does today 04.21.2021), my jaw hurt, i was light headed and again very foggy.  On Wednesday it was the same thing and I called the VA and they told me to come to the ER for evaluation.

                                                I received the COVID Vaccine at 12:30 PM. My temperature had been increasing all afternoon along with my heart rate. At roughly 8:40 PM, my temperature increased dramatically to approximately 38.9C. This may have happened over a relatively short period of time, since it was 37.9 C at approximately 8:00 PM. My heart rate increased to 150 bpm and I became dizzy. After a minute, my heart rate decreased to roughly 115 bpm.  Unsure whether to call EMS or not, I called a friend, who is a Dr. at the local hospital (Dr. is a colleague we do research together.) Dr. was concerned but provided information on what to do and when to call EMS or be driven to the ER. I spent the rest of the evening with a pulse between 105 and 110 and my temperature hovered around 38.9C until at least 12:30 AM.   The next day, my heart rate had decreased to roughly 80 bpm and my temperature to approximately 37.8C. I spent most of Tuesday sleeping. Today (Wednesday May 12, 2021) my heart rate is down to roughly 76bpm. My temperature is holding around 37.2C.   I have reported this to the CDC through the COVID vaccine reporting app.   My resting pulse is usually 62 bpm with a waking pulse of 58-60. My normal temperature is 36.5-36.7C. I have a wellness exam schedule for Monday. Dr. is not my regular GP, but was available at a time when my regular doctor was not available.

He was bleeding because he had hit his face and his lip was split and his tooth was chipped. He also continued to be very dizzy, was extremely pale, and was sweating profusely. The EMT arrived about 20 minutes later and took him to the emergency room.

                                                Patient received Janssen vaccine was told to sit for 15 minutes post observation. He came up shortly after (less than 5 mins post imz) saying he didn&#39;t feel well, like he was going to pass out. I immediately came from the pharmacy, my tech sat a chair behind him. I called for optical to call a code white. The patient requested to sit on the ground. At this point, his wife was present. He was sweating. I gave him an ice pack, a water after it was determined he was breathing okay. He was pale, extremely lethargic and sweating. After sitting him on floor I told my tech to call 911. I took his blood pressure, it was 99/73, pulse 75. Very low for him. Hes on blood pressure medicine but been having issues controlling it. He later tells me hes terrified of needles. He also tells his wife he hadn&#39;t eaten all day. I stayed with the patient until ems left with him because when standing his heart rate dropped 20 points, after they stuck him again to check his blood sugar. They determined then he should be checked out at the hospital and they took him.

                                                After the initial 12 hour period, I experienced night-time chills followed then by being too warm and night sweats.  This happened both the first and second night.  During the day I was taking Tylenol every 6 hours for aches and pain.  Mainly my neck and back have been what hurts, although my knees, elbows, hips, etc. also were achy.  The third and fourth days I still continued to have chills, no fever throughout as far as I am aware (took my temp 2-3 times).  The fourth day I was very faint and somewhat unbalanced, felt shaky and light headed and I ended up having an anxiety attack.  I mention the last symptom as I have never had an episode like this previously in my life.  Today is day 5, still feel tired, slightly nauseous, neck and back pain, headache, difficulty focusing.

Vaccinator was notified that he has a history of vasovagal response with needles. This response presents itself as sweating (and possible fainting) and is alleviated by lying down. Client mentioned that previous nurse advised him to smell an alcohol pad to distract and prevent a vasovagal response, as this had worked previously on a glucose check. No medications were disclosed or history of anaphylaxis reported. With this background information, RN offered to have vaccine administered in reclined position, however client refused. RN conferred with co-lead about administration recommendations. Vaccinator then checked in with patient at 1423 to see if patient was okay and patient did not answer the question. RN then felt the client&#39;s hand and noticed hand was clammy. At 1425 the reclining chair was brought to the station and patient was transferred into chair, appearing diaphoretic. RN palpated pulse and noted patient was not tachycardia, but RN did note tachypnea and uneasiness. RN then provided distraction and promoted relaxation. Then at 1426 patient reported feeling okay and RN noted patient no longer felt clammy. At 1440 patient was asked if he would prefer if EMS should be called, patient declined and stated that he was able to drive home. Then at 1447 patient left the site appearing well, alert and oriented x3 leaving by self in private car.

Shortly after these symptoms I begin to have uncontrollable chills followed by a fever and Nausea. The whole time starting around 8pm I had pretty bad muscle aches as well. I took a warm shower and bundled up the whole night because I had a fever, aches, chills, and nausea. It was impossible to sleep because of this and sometimes my heart was beating fast as well. The next morning I had a headache that would not go away until I took Tylenol. The whole next day I felt exhausted as well and very weak. I began to feel better on day 3 but still feel somewhat foggy from the shot. I would not recommend this vaccine to anyone and would never get it again and hopefully the foggy sensation goes away.

The patient asked to be directed out of the vaccine lane (prior to proceeding to the post administration area) to just get some air. The patient got out of the car, felt dizzy and fainted. Patient fell to the ground in a sitting position. Patient was assessed by BLS and refused transport.  Patient switched positions and allowed his passenger to drive off scene.

During a phone call a few days following his vaccine, he told me that his continues to experience shoulder pain and issues with range of motion following administration of the J&amp;J COVID vaccine.  When he first informed me, I asked him if the discomfort he was feeling was expected  pain and discomfort at the injection site, to which he responded no. He reports that a couple days following administration upon stretching when waking he experienced shooting  left upper arm/shoulder pain and reduced ROM the arm in which he received the vaccine. I am reporting this adverse event as he is still having this issue.

                                                11 days following the single shot I developed severe pain in my right calf muscle that felt like a charlie horse and on my leg from knee to my ankle felt a squeezing sensation like I was wearing a very tight sock that I couldn&#39;t take off.  After a few days the pain subsided and the similar pain began in my left leg however not as severe.  The pain would seemingly move around and come and go.  Some days it was so bad I couldn&#39;t walk or balance.  I believed I had a muscular issue.  I then began having swelling on the top of my left foot and around the ankle of my left foot.  After about a week, my right leg began to swell from the knee to ankle fairly significantly.  New veins appeared on the front of my right leg and other veins on the back of my right leg began to bulge.   Pain on both legs started to subside on the evening of 5/23, however swelling continued.   On the evening of 5/25 I was experiencing severe squeezing sensation and bulging veins in my right leg.

                                                I received the shot on 4/10. First 24 hours I had a slight fever and headache. Treated with Acetaninophhen. Since that time, I had relatively mild symptoms 4/11 - 4/13. Mostly fatigue.  On 4/14, I had a sudden increase in heart rate, dizziness, tingling sensation in all arms and legs and weakness in my limbs/grip. This prompted me to visit the ER. They ran numerous blood tests amd scans on me but found no abnormalities. Various unusual symptoms have continued to persist since 4/14.  For brief moments I feel fine.  At other times I have experience fatigue, diziness/vertigo, rapid heart rate, pins and needles feeling in my left hand and left leg.  Left leg numbness/tightness and heaviness. The fingers on my left hand sometimes move involuntarily.  And my anxiety has also gone up during this time. Tonight it has migratee to my left foot, where I have numbness in several of my toes.  I&#39;m looking for advice. Should I be concerned? Should these symptoms still be occurring 11 days after receiving my shot?  It has been very distressing and there seem to be very few people who have knowledge on this subject.  My care providers keep saying to self monitor and contact them if symptoms worsen. The problem is symptoms don&#39;t necessarily worsen, they just migrate from one area of my body to another.  The numbness comes and goes in maybe 1-2 hour intervals.

                                                Blood clot in superficial vein behind right knee as well as vertigo and nausea.  Currently on 30mg/day of XARELTO blood thinner (I&#39;ve been taking since diagnosis on 5/5/21).  Will continue to take 20mg/day for the next 30 days.  Background: I started to notice my right calf get tight and sore approximately ~3 weeks following my vaccination.  I had been doing a lot of running and hill training so I assumed it was a muscle strain/aggravation.  After approximately 1-2 weeks I noticed the tightness worsen and also noticed significant swelling around my lower calf/ankle.  I went to the doctor on 5/4/21 and was given a D Dimer blood test which came back 1.27 mcg/mL FEU (over the recommended 0.5 mcg/mL).  The next day I had an ultrasound of my right leg where they discovered the SVT clot behind my right knee in a superficial vein (but near a major/deep vein intersection).  I was immediately prescribed XARELTO blood thinner - to be taken for ~51 days.  ~21 days of 30mg/day (15mg twice/day) followed by ~30 days of 20mg/day 1x per day.  The morning of 5/20/21 around 6:30am I started to feel nausea and vertigo after returning home from walking my dog.  I finished a low-intensity exercise routine at my home and around ~7:15am my symptoms worsened.  I went upstairs to my bedroom to lay down on my bed and the room started spinning.  I then went to the bathroom and vomited clear fluid.  I started feeling a little better after vomiting but was still slightly dizzy and light-headed.  I made an appointment and went to the doctor around 10:30am.  The doctor suggested doing further bloodwork and a CT scan of my head.  Both tests came back normal.  The doctor suggested the vertigo and nausea were inner ear related and that I should continue taking XARELTO and to also start wearing a compression sock (especially during exercise/activity).

Then suddenly I felt a severe headache (as if my head was shot by a gun) at the center of my forehead. This is only the first time I felt that kind of headache. However, it only lasted for about 5-10 secs for that severe pain then after that i just felt dizzy for about 20 mins. Since then, I&#39;m fine now and hoping that I will not feel that same pain again.

It was not hurting if not moving but hurt when walking on uneven surface or when tried to move the ankle. I used bandage few days.   its not completely gone, but much better and hurts when try to push the foot/toe downwards.

                                                Got COVID (Janssen) vaccine shot on April 6th at noon.  Felt fine Tuesday and went to bed as normal.  Woke up April 7th at 7AM with sharp pains in my left shoulder (same side as shot) and slight shortness of breath, and slight chest pain in the left quadrant of my torso (same side as shot).  Proceeded to take Advil and seemed to help a bit.  Minor aches/pains and shortness of breath throughout the day until about 8PM.  At this time shoulder chest pain became more severe, and breathing became very strained, short, and painful.  Pain and breathing kept getting worse and at midnight on Wednesday night thought I was having a heart attack due to extreme chest pain, couldn&#39;t breath, lightheaded, dizzy, tingly extremities.  My wife drove me to ER at 12:30 AM Thursday.

Symptoms go away after the third day.  Then nearly two weeks later the feeling of being light-headed, pulsation sensation throughout my body, and feeling faint at times came back.  It&#39;s been a few days of these symptoms returning and it has me concerned.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: Unknown) frequency 1 total, dose was not reported, administered to left arm on 06-APR-2021 at 12 noon for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 6-APR-2021 at 12 noon, patient got vaccinated and was fine that day . Next morning on 07-APR-2021,  patient woke up with sever cramping in same shoulder which he got the shot in, most pain was in the upper left quarter of his torso to down half way to chest up to the shoulder till the neck . By the end of the day it  spread to his whole chest and upper body. Also he had shortness of breath ,could not breath .The cramping and shortness of breath came at same time. He took Advil and went along with his day . He took 3 tablet of Advil 200mg  every 4-5 hours all day ( total of 3 dose that day) . By night time the case was progressively worse as the whole chest had a lot of pain . He thought that he had heart attack . He thought that he was about to  pass out . He could not stand on his own . So his wife took him to emergency room at mid night at 12:30 am on 08-APR-2021. He stayed there for 5 hours and they did  bunch of tests , EKG which rolled out the heart attack .They did  Chest X-ray which found things then did D-dimer which its level was very high . They found  bunch of clots in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides. They did ultra sound on the legs  which had no evidence of blood clots . They discharged him  from the emergency room as  they felt that he was ok to be out . After couple of hours after discharge , patient&#39;s health care professional wrote for him Eliquis, antibiotic and pain reliver. He was given antibiotic because he had  beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed) . It was found air sacs in lung with signs of pneumonia in both lobes . He came home and started to  monitor his blood oxygen . He stayed in the  same position till recovery . He was better each day since last week but still had sinus and cramping in the chest ( very minor but was still there). The lung capacity was very limited to take some steps. Patient stated that he needed a specialist to understand his condition. He had no medical history before that incidence . He was wondering regarding which type of blood thinner was good for this type of blood clots because he read that the regular blood thinners are not good for that type of blood clot which his HCP gave (regular blood thinner). Laboratory data included: Total lung capacity decreased (NR: not provided) lung capacity is very limited. On 08-APR-2021, Laboratory data included: Chest X-ray (NR: not provided) found things, EKG (NR: not provided) rolled out heart attack, Fibrin D dimer (NR: not provided) level was very high, and Ultrasound scan (NR: not provided) no evidence of blood clots.  Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included: apixaban, and ibuprofen. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of the severe cramping in left shoulder and upper body, chest pain (whole chest had lot of pain)/thought that he had heart attack, shortness of breath/could not breath, thought that he was about to pass out, difficulty in standing, bunch of clots in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides, beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed), cramping in chest and sinus was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments:  This 44-year-old male patient reported blood clots of both lungs 2 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  The patient denies any medical history/condition prior to vaccination.  The symptoms reported were severe cramping of arm that spread to his whole chest and upper body and shortness of breath; the patient thought he had a heart attack, about to pass out and could not stand because of the progression of pain.  EKG done at the emergency room ruled out heat attack, D-Dimer was reported to be very high, clots were found in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides, x-ray showed beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed).  The patient was prescribed with Eliquis, an unspecified antibiotic and pain reliever.  Outcome of the events were not reported.   Based on the information that is available, the event is assessed as plausible with the causal association to immunization, per WHO causality classification of adverse events following immunization based on a lack of a definitive plausible biological mechanism.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

Then, after the first week of having the vaccine, I began to have these symptoms about once a week.

Yesterday (5/12), I had the same thing. Chills and the inability to stay warm, loss of appetite, and a sort of sleepy vertigo.

                                                Pt. received the vaccine at approximately 2:44pm.  Before I could hand him his card, his hands began trembling and he looked pale.  I asked how he was feeling.  He reported feeling shaky, dizzy, and very hot.  I asked him if he was having any difficulty breathing, had tightness in his throat/airways, or even felt a tingle.  He said no.  Noting the time, I asked if he had eaten lunch.  I asked if he has ever felt this way before.  He said he had when he gets a &#34;hypoglycemic attack.&#34;  While not diabetic nor on any medications, he said he will occasionally get very low blood sugar.  He said he had not eaten since early that morning.  Another employee brought some juice I requested.  I again asked him about symptoms related to anaphylaxis, to which was not an indication of an anaphylactic reaction.  I gave him the juice to sip.  I asked him again about symptoms.  Because he was still dizzy, I took his blood pressure/heart rate.  His BP was 160/119 and heart rate 96bpm.  His color became more gray over the next several minutes.  He was still too dizzy to stand, felt hot, shaky, and now nauseous.  He handed over the juice and was given a receptacle if he vomited.  We suspected a vasovagal response, but was still symptomatic after 10 minutes. Meanwhile, the other pharmacist tried to call his doctor&#39;s office.  We learned his doctor had moved away and he had not yet come in nor selected a new provider.   We asked him if he felt he needed to be seen by a doctor.  He said he did and agreed to us calling an ambulance.   The ambulance arrived around 3:10.  The EMTs took his BP.  It had come down, but he could not stand up without his knees buckling.  The EMTs got him on the stretcher and took him to the hospital.

                                                Approximately 15 minutes after receiving the vaccination, my throat became dry and my eyes began watering. It was hard to tell but my throat felt slightly swollen also. I drank some water and a few minutes later things seemed to clear up. Randomly throughout the afternoon I had similar dry/itchy/tingling in my throat but not as strong as the time right after the vaccination. I didn&#39;t suspect this was directly related to the virus since I have allergies to grasses, trees, pollen, etc. and take over the counter allergy medicine as needed.  At 3:30am today (4/10/21) I woke up having to use the restroom and when standing up out of bed I was extremely dizzy. After laying down in bed the dizziness disappeared. When waking up later in the morning the dizziness/light headed feeling was still present when standing. I also have noticed random strange pinching pain in my legs that only last for 1-2 seconds and sends a quick short pain sensation throughout my body.    I have no clue if any of this is related to the vaccination received, but after noticing news articles with issues in a few folks receiving the Janssen vaccine, I decided I would pass this info along just in case.

This feeling was persistent and constant for all of the day after the shot and in the morning two days after the shot.  The symptoms then subsided and I was fine for the remainder of the day and have been fine since.

EMS were called and he was seen in ER due to low heart rate and sweating to rule out any heart conditions. He had 2 EKGs - one in the ambulance and one in the ER. He also had to have a CT for falling and bumping his head to rule out that injury. The DX was listed as a vagal response, but we are not so sure we agree given that he is 45 years old, has no priory history or anxiety about shots.

                                                after receiving vaccine, about 12 hours later i had the standard side effect of moderate fever (approx 102), chills, and was very fatigued.  The fever was gone the next day, but i took the next day off and stayed in bed.  The concerning problem was i developed tingling and numbness throughout most of my body, especially on the side where i had the shot, in my arm, neck mouth and tongue.   After about 36 hours after the shot i started to feel about 80% better, but the tingling/numbness continued and i continued to have major fatigue.  From day 3-5, i was having some trouble moving around - almost like my legs weren&#39;t wanting to respond to my brain.   Since these symptoms lasted until about day 5, i got concerned and called the doctor.   However, right before talking with the doctor in day 5 i was able to do some yoga and was feeling much better, and it all seemed to resolve.  I feel better now.

                                                Patient was waiting/ being observed after receiving the Janssen Covid vaccine. Approximately 10 minutes after the vaccine, he reported feeling very faint and was about to pass out. He wasn&#39;t feeling well so 911 was called. He also reported feeling hot and was visibly sweating. He drank some water and sat in front of a small fan until medics arrived. They assessed him and he walked out with them for further evaluation. I called patient at 7:30 to see how he was feeling. There was no answer and his voicemail didn&#39;t allow me to leave a message.

                                                Before receiving the vaccination the patient mentioned he had a fear of needles.  Patient was asked if he ever fainted after getting a vaccination or injection and patient reported no.   The vaccine was administered to the patient and patient appeared to be fine for the next few minutes after getting vaccinated.  Patient was told he could take a seat in the waiting area and wait until his 15-minutes were up and he could go.  Patient was seated in the waiting area for about a minute but then got up to walk down one of the isles. When walking down the isle patient fainted and collapsed. This occurred approximately 10 minutes or so after he received the vaccine.  Patient was helped to a chair and once seated appeared to shake/convulse (almost like a seizure) for approximately 5-10 seconds before snapping out of it and regaining consciousness.  Afterwards he was alert and talking but didn&#39;t remember fainting.  911 was called and he was checked out by paramedics. After observing him for 15 minutes or so and determining his heartrate and blood pressure were normal and he appeared to be ok, the paramedics told him they can take him to the hospital to be evaluated further, or he was free to leave on his own without going to the hospital.  The patient said he felt fine and declined being taken to the hospital. After another 10-15 minutes the patient left under his own power. Patient mentioned he would possibly be calling his physician and alerting them to the episode.

His parents reported he has a medical condition/disability that requires him to receive services in their home.  After receiving the vaccine the patient reported feeling lightheaded, dizzy, hot, and that his blood pressure felt abnormal.  He requested an ambulance and some water.  I called 911 and provided him water, but did not administer any epinephrine or any other medications.  The paramedics arrived and talked to him for about 15 minutes.  He then left on his own accord with his parents and declined further medical attention.

I woke up several times during the night and felt feverish. I got up once and felt dizzy and had some body aches. At around 7:00 am the following day I took my temperature and it was 99.4 F.  I took acetaminophen at 8:00 am. I went back to bed and was still feverish and sweating. I woke up at 10:15 am and felt much better. My fever was gone and I had no more chills or body aches. After that time no other adverse reactions occurred.

At 15 minutes asked nurse if normal. Then started sweating. left hand turned purple. Dont really remember anything else. Went unconscious. Remember them yelling Code something and Cardiac arrest. Taken to ER. Think they may have said anaphalatic shock. I think they gave me epinepherine. Had paralysis in left hand when i woke up for a few minutes. Blood work and EKG were normal. Went home within a couple of hours. Light-headed two days later still. Saw doctor two days after. Blood pressure is high.  Little bit of fatigue and brain fog.

                                                I received the J&amp;J shot after work on Friday around 5:30 p.m.. Around 3 a.m. Saturday morning, I woke up with a fever and chills. My head was hot. My body was cold. I had a pretty severe headache as well.  My body ached all over. Muscle and joint pain. I took Tylenol, but it didn&#39;t seem to do much. I spent all day Saturday in bed or on the couch. I ran a fever of 100.9 to 101.6 all day Saturday. My body ached making it hard to go up or down stairs. I was weak feeling and I was exhausted just going to refrigerator to get juice or water. Not much of an appetite all day. Also, arm was sore and bruised at the shot location. That was the least of my issues. Today is Sunday and I am feeling better now. I feel like the worst is absolutely behind me, but I felt so terrible yesterday, I thought I should report my issues.

He remained in the IMZ room for observation and applied a cool compress to forehead and back of neck.  Coloring came back after about 10-15 minutes and he said he felt better.  Also mentioned that this happened to him after he got a TDap vaccine about 15 years ago - he said it is a mental thing with him and does not like to get vaccines.

                                                Since receiving the vaccine, I have developed tightness in my chest and shortness of breath.  At times, it has been severe.  Feeling like I might pass out, I went to Immediate Care on 04/12.  They didn?t identify a cause.  On 04/15, I went to my Doctor, who noted wheezing in my upper lungs.  An inhaler and pantoprazole were prescribed.  At times, it feels like I am having something similar to an asthma attack.  The inhaler has helped.  Prior to the vaccine, I didn?t have any history of breathing problems, nor does it run in my family.

When we went to assist him he asked to lay on the floor, before we could help him to this position he fainted, we got him on the floor and on his side, within about twenty seconds he woke up and was very aware of his situation. We applied ice packs under his neck and on his forehead.  After about twenty minutes he sat up and started to gain his color back.  At this point he told us he had fainted before after a flu shot and and donating blood.  Several minutes later he was able to stand up and sit in a chair.  Cold packs were continued and he drank a bottle of orange juice.  Twenty minutes later he said he was back to normal just felt weak like after a work out.  He wanted to use the restroom and was escorted, showed no additional signs or symptoms at this point, and wanted to go home.

Pharmacist told patient to sit back down and immediately grabbed e-kit and headed to patient&#39;s side.  Patient was clammy (like just got out of shower).  At 3:45 PM BP was 128/63 and PR was 44.  At 3:50 PM BP was 92/56 and PR 51,  at this point RPh decided it was more than a vaso-vagal reaction and administered the epinephrine injection at 3:51 PM - EMS was called.  At 3:52 PM BP was 130/76 and PR 59, 3:55 PM 134/86  PR 66, 3:58 PM  BP was 148/83 and PR 68 at 3:59 PM EMS arrived and patient declined them taking him to hospital via ambulance due to no insurance.  He had pharmacist escort him to his car so he could get his cell phone and back to pharmacy so he could call his son to pick him up and take him to the hospital. Unknown if patient ended up going to hospital.

Shortly after (1 or 2 mins) patient got shot he got warm around the face and said he felt slightly dizzy.  So we laid him on his back and elevated his feet.  We put cold compress around his neck.  This only lasted about 5-10 mins.  Called pt couple hours later with no concerns.

                                                I started sweating profusely within 30 min of the shot. Was light headed and dizzy for approximately 4-5 hrs. Once the sweating stopped I felt severe pain in both knees and ankles. If felt as if you were trying to snap my knees and ankles in half. That lasted 4-5 hrs. After I slept for a few hrs over night I woke up and felt pretty good. Approximately 3-4 hrs after I woke up I felt light headed and nauseated for approximately 3-4 hrs. I felt pretty much back to normal into the third day after the shot. I was slightly light headed and fatigued for approximately 8 days after the shot. After about the 8th day I felt normal again. I said I will never get that shot again. Approximately 25 years ago I had gotten my first flew shot and I was very sick for a week. Never received another flew shot again. Besides the stress and anxiety issues I am a healthy guy. Every 2 years we get full blood work up and my blood levels have always been spot on of where they should be.

                                                About 2 weeks after I received my Covid vaccine  I experienced a sharp pain in my chest. I wasn&#39;t on going so I didn&#39;t worry about it but another week after that I began to feel palpitations and decided to go to the emergency room at Hospital. I was given an EKG and an X -Ray of my chest. They didn&#39;t notice any abnormalities so they told me to follow up with my physician. My doctor made an appointment for me to have a stress test. I was on the treadmill for 6 minutes and my blood pressure dropped so low that Dr. called an ambulance to take me to the hospital.  I was there from the 27th to the 30th of May taking test.  I  also had a cardiac cath test which came back inconclusive. Another symptom that now is troubling me is vertigo

                                                Dizziness start on Sunday,  3/21/2021 and has been present every day since so far. This is abnormal for me. Prior to that, I have been having some problems breathing after getting the vaccine and have been using my Ventolin  more often after the vaccine. Also noticed shortly after getting the vaccine, a feeling of liquid in my right ear.  the liquid in the ear did go away a day before the dizziness started.  Did not consider the ear or breathing issues as possible side effects  as I do have asthma and figured the ear was congestion. Not sure if the dizziness and the feeling of liquid in my right ear are related and/or related to the vaccine.

Suffered trauma to noise and back during fall as a result of passing out including laceration from hitting face on counter.  After coming to sever body shakes.  Temperature was taken twice and recorded 92.5 and 93.0.  Blood pressure and pulse after moving to couch to lie sit down was normal.  Next day couldn&#39;t do much and was very tired.  By second day I was recovered but sealing with injuries from the fall.

                                                I received the shot at 1:11 pm. I felt sorta drunk and not safe to drive by 3 pm. Sorta woozy. By 7 I was  home and fell asleep and did not wake up until 4 pm the next day.   I was sleepy and felt terrible nausea and was sweaty three nights in a row.  By the 2nd night  I had a headache that was unbelievable.  I eventually took Tylenol 48 hrs after the shot and it barely helped the headache. I never ever get sick never have headaches. It was bad. I was also super super irritable and I am generally a happy person. I was so bothered by everyone I was sorta angry at them it was weird. By Sunday night my headache was even worse so bad in my neck on my left side that I had the shot, I could barely move my head. I took Tylenol recommended dose. I finally fell asleep on Sunday night 3 days later midnight sweaty again.   Monday morning I woke up and I never felt better. On top of the world amazing.  I felt not  just good but extra good. Ready to go for it all.  It was a very strange experience for over three days. I typically get the flu shot, I stay healthy and never had an experience like this, I don?t get sick luckily. Any I wanted to share this because it was so strange and no one warned me really. .  I have felt great since and am thankful I had the shot.

His skin was cold and clammy.  This happened about 5 minutes after the vaccine. We assisted him to a room where he laid down flat and I applied ice pack to his head and chest. Pt felt better after about 30 minutes.  Pt stated he had never had this reaction before.  Pt was discharged from the clinic with his father, in stable condition.

                                                Swollen lymph nodes and abdominal pain from right him bone down to scrotum. Pain on 4/7 was such that i though i was suffering a hernia.  Couldn&#39;t get out of car or move my right leg across my body. Could put right leg into pants leg.  Hurt to bend over and do much of anything on 4/7.   Initially thought pain was in testicle but doesn&#39;t hurt at all to the touch.  Realized it more a swollen area in the groin between hip bone and scrotum.   Nothing hurts to the touch at all in that area either which lead my to believe it was swollen lymph nodes.  The  Feeling is as if i got hit in the right groin  and my testicle has been hit and discomfort is 8 inches above right testicle in my groin area.    It has been improving every day since then, the more i walk the better it is.  It only hurts when i sit now and it seems to aggravate it pretty well but once i start moving the pain goes away.  It has been 9 days now and the i don&#39;t notice it all day until i come back to the office and sit at my desk and again it gets aggravated and the discomfort feels like my right testicle is near my appendix  Since this all started my legs feel heavier in the calf and have little nerve sensations when i sit too, which concerns me about the blood clot possibility and so i have been emailing with my doctor.  I am going to make appt for Monday 4/19

                                                About 10 minutes after injection, got dizzy/clammy. It took about 5-10 minutes after that with EMTs to wait until my blood pressure normalized, and then I was fine.  Walked off site.  Slowly throughout the day had an increasingly bad headache, which peaked about 10 hours after the injection. Around that same time, bad fatigue started, and then slight chills. The headache at this point was extremely severe for about 10-12 hours. After that (so 20-22 hours after initial injection) the fatigue and chills subsided, but came back occasionally. The headache was less severe at that point, but in total did not go away until an additional 15 hours had passed.   My estimate is that took about 36-40 hours to feel 100% normal again.

Until recently, it was difficult to raise my hands over my head, and it would be difficult to stand up from a sitting position. I have regularly exercised and done resistance training for several years. I&#39;m not sure if this is coincidental nor am I concerned, but a pharmacist encouraged me to report it here.

At 10:00 am second RN gave patient a bottle of water, because he stated he was thirsty. Second RN asked to check BP again at 10:01am on the left arm, manually and it was 194/115 and pulse was 81. Second RN took manual BP again at 10:06 am and it was 190/110 and pulse was 82. Crackers were also given to patient at this time.

Saturday April 23rd Went to er was treated for kidney stones but they could only find one small one,  Was sent home with pain medication.  Shortness of breath persisted as did bloody cough and pain in chest and all over. Went back to the er on 4/28 as pain was unbearable (chest pain)  once given a cat scan and diagnosed with blood clots in my lungs and then an ultra sound and found a blood clot in my leg (just above knee).  It is thought that I was mis-diagnosed on the original trip to the er with kidney stones.  I have been put on blood thinners and pain medication and will be following up with my doctor.

About 1 hour later I started getting the cold chills, a headache and shaking.  About 1 more hour later I had a fever, achy joints and muscle aches.  The symptoms lasted through the night until about 8:30 the next morning when I started sweating.  I decided then to take aceteminiphen and Naproxen.  This helped me to feel a little better.  Side effects were resolved after 24 hours

I will say that the typical side effect from this vaccine is very intense and should be looked at further. I was alarmed to say the least.

Soon, this was accompanied by dull but severe pain in left shoulder and upper left back (top of scapula and around collar bone), extending to base of neck. This pain lasted 2 weeks, and was severe enough to prevent patient from sitting or standing for more than a few minutes at a time, especially during the first week of pain. Painkillers (Acetaminophen or NSAIDs) or muscle relaxants (cyclobenzaprine) did not help alleviate the pain. The pain started on March 17, and finally eased up on April 2 (the vaccination was on March 13). There is still some pain and stiffness in the left arm (currently in the biceps), but it is no longer severe. By the way, in addition to the above symptoms starting at 96 hours, there were the usual expected systemic symptoms immediately after the vaccination (starting at 6 hours and ending at 36 hours): light fever, mild body ache, fatigue and mild local pain at injection site.

On 4/6/21 I came home from work about 7:00 am due to an extreme headache and muscle weakness. By the afternoon my fever was up to 101. On 4/7 my fever went up to 102.7 and I was shaking uncontrollably, sweating , dizzy, headache, and had heaviness in my chest. I felt as if I were going to have a stroke. The headache was excruciating. I took acetaminophen 500 x 2 and 400 mg of ibuprofen, and Theraflu to try and alleviate the symptoms. On 4/9/21 my fever broke, but the weakness, dizziness and headaches have continued. I currently have ongoing headaches and dizziness. I have not gone to the doctor because I do not have a PCP. I am looking for one now.

I was also feeling tired and unsteady. 12 days after the shot I became very sick for 10 days with severe diarrhea, no energy,  stomach pains, weak, shaking, no more motivation.  I saw a doctor and was given antibiotics to stop the diarrhea. Now 1 month after I have no diarrhea but still get nausea and shakes . I feel very anxious and will see a therapist and prescribe medication for my anxiety that I have due to the vaccine reaction.  I took the vaccine so I can travel abroad much easier but now afraid to travel because of my symptoms.  I will get blood tested tomorrow to see if all is ok.  This vaccine is very dangerous as it has affected my DNA.

                                                After giving vaccination, while he was waiting in line on pharmacy register, he felt dizzy/lightheaded, chill and was having cold sweats. He sat down on a chair about 30 minutes just to relax.  Before the shot, he was pretty nervous about getting vaccinated (needles) and his fiance told me that he hardly gets vaccinated in the past because he is afraid of needles. She was not sure if his reaction is because of his nervousness about the vaccine or if it is an allergic reaction. I told his fiance who was with him the whole time, to take him to the ER if he is having hard time breathing or if his dizziness gets prolonged.  I tried calling patient and her fiance  on 5/10/21 vaccination day, and 5/12/21 again and left message to follow up but no answer/ call back.

Patient mistakenly believed he required two doses, one in each arm. Vaccinator administered the extra dose. He asked the patient if he had received the COVID19 shot before, but the patient misunderstood and said that he had not received the shot before that day. Patient reported lightheadedness and nausea approximately 24 hours after the vaccination. Approximately 72 hours after the vaccination, the patient reported no other side effects and said that he was in good condition.

                                                Initial symptoms began with pain at the injection site and generalized fatigue.  This developed into soft tissue pain in proximity of the large and small joints which could be elicited further on palpation.  I had eye pain (left more severe than the right) which could be further elicited on palpation, headache, dizziness, chills, and an inability to feel warm.  There was also significant skin sensitivity over the trunk, scalp, and upper extremities and more in the left arm than the right.  The symptoms persisted over the second day albeit at less severity.  Presently on the third day, I am experiencing continued eye pain, mainly in the left eye and mild dizziness.

Arm is hard to lift up at some times and weak to lift anything up sometimes. Arm feels week for about 2 to 3 days and then starts to fill better. Then after a day of the soreness or no weakness in the arm, it starts back hurting again. It now getting worse at night time and sometimes during the day. Some days it hurts so bad that I can&#39;t even move it. I don&#39;t bother to tell my wife, because it just last for about a 2 to 3 hours. I have been to my doctor yet. But if it keeps bothering me I will make an appointment to see him.  It just my arm and hand be very weak to use at sometimes every other day.

We thought it was related to the weather getting warm and we work the night shift, so he rested and increased his water intake. He was able to go to work on Monday night and return home and continued to rest on Tuesday. On Tuesday, there was no numbness, but there was weakness in both his legs. On Wednesday, he felt weakness throughout his body, especially in his legs. On Thursday, he collapsed. He did not lose consciences but his legs gave out under him and he was not able to get up up. He was taken to the hospital. He was diagnosed with a stroke, increased sugars (diabetes he has never had before), acute kidney injury, and uncontrolled increased blood pressure. He was hospitalized and discharged April 19, 2021. He was readmitted 04/24/2021 for another stroke.

Then on Friday, 4/23/21 he woke up early with pain in his left arm near the area of the injection and the back of his arm and to his shoulder like he was hit with a bat.  It did not move the next day and went to his PCP on Tuesday and referenced Ortho and could not find any doctor and his pain was getting worse.  He went to the ER on Wednesday, had a bad experience.  Went back on Friday 4/30/21 and nothing was done for his shoulder and needs to see somebody regarding his arm.  The arm is painful and painful to move in all directions.   They did not do anything for him in the ER, actually made it worse.   The ER said that they could not do an MRI as he needed a referral from an orthopedist for that.    They wanted to check him for his heart, and they would not listen to him.

He was feeling light-headed and sweaty. We put his feet up in the chair and he briefly passed out for about 10 seconds. He came around quickly and we gave him a drink. He sat for about 10-15 minutes longer and we made sure he was feeling good before he left.

He was difficult to wake up and confused when he did. We called 911 and paramedics came to check him out. They monitored his blood pressure and pulse. His pulse was high (120-130bpm), so they thought it would be best to take him to the hospital so he can be checked out.

                                                Vaccine administered Thursday, 4/1 1:15 p.m. By Sunday I experienced mild headache and upper respiratory scratchiness. By late Monday 4/5 I experienced fatigue, dizziness, upper respiratory scratchiness and increased post-nasal drip, tightness in my chest, muscle soreness and headache. By Tuesday, 4/6 around 10 a.m. in addition to the above symptoms I had a severe headache and lost feeling in my right arm for half an hour, with severe muscle cramps and loss of use in that arm. The muscle issues subsided by early afternoon leaving only fatigue, headache, dizziness and a lingering respiratory tightness and sinus issues. Concerned about vaccine side-effects I was reading about, I made a doctor&#39;s appointment for the following week (earliest available), met with a physician&#39;s assistant who prescribed an antibiotic (Doxycycline Mono 100 Mg) for the sinus issues but did not address the other issues.

                                                abdominal pain. The pain was so severe that my knees would buckle and several times if I was holding anything, it caused me to drop it. After about a week, I had an appointment at 4:30 and was scheduled for the next morning at 8:30 to meet with a back and spine doctor for xrays.  Xrays were negative.  I was then schedule with a neck and hand specialist a few days later. This appointment could not provide a diagnosis.  Back and abdominal pain increase and soreness had spread to the stomach and groin.  After the news broke of the cerebral blood clots in 6 women.  See attached Continuation Page.

                                                1st day of vaccine; I felt very tired and fatigued  and my joints started to hurt and I could not walk due to the pain in my joints. 3rd and 4th day of vaccine; I started to experience numbness sensation to my hands. I also had numbness sensation to my face, right side and lips and also to my head. I went to Urgent Care where lab work was performed as well as a CT scan of the head to check for blood clots and results came back normal. Also an U/S of the right leg to check for any blood clots was performed which came back normal. I then went to see my PCP who performed more tests and exams, again did lab work to check for blood coagulation and still continued with the numbness sensation to my hands and all to my body. After about 10 days of my vaccine, I noticed that my oxygen level was 87, 96, 86, 92 and where my oxygen level has always been around 98 or 99.  I will be also having heart studies in a few weeks. I have not recovered from my symptoms and feel very fatigued and tired all the days.

I have a limited range of motion now and turning my arm, reaching for something can cause the sharp pain to occur. It will go away after about 10 seconds.

Walking 10ft or up the stairs triggered my symptoms. Once I stopped moving, my symptoms would dissipate.   I called my PCP along with a cardiologist up until today.   I was tested for blood clots, had complete blood panel, stress test and nuclear stress test. My symptoms are getting better but still have mildly present.  My last meeting with the cardiologist, what he saw after the nuclear stress test, that there was a lack of blood flow where to the lower right heart chamber. He said it probably due to a blood blockage or plague and at this time he is trying to figure it out.

                                                Lightheaded about 5 minutes after injection. Medical team took HR and BP and was normal Took about 20 minutes and light headedness went away  Later that night at around 12:30 am, felt very cold and shivering with severe headache Did not take temperature Had a hard time going back to sleep Got up around 1:00 am to take 800 mg of OTC Advil When walking back up stairs had severe muscle pain in arms and legs Was fine after that Seemed to get better by 2 am No issues next day  About 7-10 days later developed severe frontal headaches/sinus pressure No other symptoms Used Neti Pot with saline solution and did nothing Took OTC allergy meds and Advil and did nothing  Say my primary care Dr and he prescribed Flonase, Singular and Allegra &#43; continue Neti Pot and Advil as needed Not much improvement on this regime after 3-5 days of use  About a week later developed severe pain in bottom right jaw Took OTC Advil and again no improvement Went to Dentist and said not tooth related but probably TMJD Recommend dental appliance to help with grinding  About a few days later after this jaw pain developed, developed sharp stabbing pain in bottom of left knee cap. No recollection of any insult that would cause this  All three of these pain sites were perfectly fine prior to getting J&amp;J vaccine.  No history of pain or injury to these areas prior  All of these incidents to me seem to be inflammatory/immune in nature and could be related to J&amp;J vaccine based upon how I reacted to injection.  Curious if others are seeing the same thing and if so what should be done or how long should this last?

                                                Patient was scheduled for an appointment for a Johnson &amp;Johnson  covid-19 vaccine through a drive thru Thursday April 8, 2021 @12:45pm. We arrived early and he received the vaccine at 12:15pm, waited 30 minutes for reaction and he was feeling fine. Later that same evening, the patient was driving to work on the freeway when he felt a dry throat so he coughed hard, at that cough he felt a massive pain in his head, like his &#34;head was going to explode.&#34; He immediately had tunnel vision closing in on him, so he pulled over and later woke up in our parked car with flashing emergency lights on, parked on the shoulder of the freeway. Disoriented and confused why he was there, he looked at his watch and saw he lost 15 minutes when he had passed out. MY HUSBAND COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED IF HE HAD NOT PULLED HIMSELF OVER WHEN PASSING OUT. Today we reported this to our doctors office and to you!

                                                Lost his vaccine card would not give him a new one.  He got his vaccine, had burning sensation immediately after the needle was pulled out.  About 5-10 minutes later he started sweating, and seemed to have calmed down and felt OK.  He was observed for 30 minutes there and went for observation for another 30  minutes.  He went to another doctors office and at about 15:00 started feeling light headed and weak.  He drove back home, picked up some stuff at a grocery store, and outside the grocery store in 80 degree heat he felt the need to put on a jacket as he had the chills.  he went home, went to bed feeling bad, his shoulder was still burning where he got hte vaccin.e  He had a little bit of site pain, applied topical and the pain went away.  He woke up the next morning feeling really bad, felt like a major flu, his head felt like it was going to explode, but no problem with sinuses, no cough, no sneezing.  His eyes were watering from the pain, and chills on and off.  He had to change his sheets a couple of times due to sweating.  He then developed a fever of 99 degrees at about 18:00 that night, and about 19:00 he went to 102 when he checked it.  After that it went to 103, and about 15 minutes after that it was 104, and then higher at 104.&#43;.  He took some vodka, honey and lemon juice and took an alcohol bath and the fever had not broken yet.  He called the clinic and they told him to call 9-1- 1 and to go to the ER.  He went to the ER at about 10:00, gave him fluids, did a chest x-ray and released him about midnight.  He apparently disoriented and tried to walk off and didn&#39;t remember this.  They took him back to the gate and called his son.  He went home, took another bath and woke up in sweat and was in bed for the entire weekend.  He got up Monday morning, 4/13/21 feeling a little bit better and went to see his doctor, who does not believe he was having any side effects and that the information that is being reported is true.   He is still feeling a little weak and still fatigued and on bedrest.  He was taking Advil besides his regular medicines every 6 hours with 500 mg of Tylenol for the intense pain as every joint in his body ached, and the worst headache he had ever had, as well as the high fevers.  His fever subsided on Saturday morning, and still had some sweats following that.  Did have hot/cold flashes on Saturday and Sunday.   He was given a COVID test in the ER and he was negative, but did not give him any other information regarding his lab work.

I felt very ill. I almost threw up multiple times during the day and could not move my head up or down and to the left without spinning out of control. I saw the ENT later that day and he performed the Epley Maneuver on me. I followed his directions for home care but am currently still experiencing vertigo. The doctor told me it should dissipate within one week. It has not. I have never had vertigo in the past.

Several hours later, patient began stuttering and was unable to put his thoughts together. Later that evening, he began experiencing muscle aches, nasal congestion, nausea, and was unable to get out of bed. He took some Advil and by the next morning he felt fine and was back to normal. It should be noted that he died suddenly and unexpectedly on 05/05/2021, and an autopsy showed his death was caused by hypertensive heart disease and cardiomyopathy.

                                                Adverse Events: Tinnitus, Veritgo, Nausea 36 hours post injection there was a significant increase in volume of bilateral tinnitus which has been constant for 40 years with left side being louder and right side occasionally pulsating. Vertigo and nausea also set in 24x7 for the first week before reducing somewhat. Now 3 weeks post injection my tinnitus has increased from what was a volume of 4 out of 10 for 40 years to a solid 7/10.  The vertigo is present although not triggering nausea until I am lying on my back looking up in activities such as lying back to read a book, work under a car, read a phone/Kindle device. The increased tinnitus volume has made falling asleep in a quiet room or focusing on my work where I wear a headset for virtual meetings extremely difficult at times.

Rush to the hospital and right away the found blood clots on my left leg,  The ER did not check my right leg and two weeks later they found clots on the bottom part of my right leg.  They gave me blood thinner and now Im taking Eliquis twice a day.  Symptoms continue, I have the same pain, I dont see any improvent.  I did went to work yesterday and I realize that I can do any lifting or be sitting down for at least one hour.

Chest pain, burning sensation ongoing, presumed carditis. Cardiorespiratory performance beginning to lessen further, beyond last year&#39;s damage. Day of vaccination, about 1-2 min post injection, strong dizziness, balance problems, identical to past allergic reactions to other injectables, but time limited, only an apparent blood pressure problem - passes in its own, heavy caffeination helps reduce the problem, temporary nuisance only &amp; apparently affected a fair number of folks at the site. Chose not to report that issue at the time, since familiar and not serious, only unpleasant.

                                                I just thought I should report two changes I have noticed in my body since being vaccinated, the first being about a dozen small pimples on my forehead, which is weird for me, but were evident for several days that week after the vaccine; and I have been very dizzy when I get up in the  middle of the night to go to the bathroom, bumping into the wall, which is uncommon for me.  I also teach at a community college and I noticed that I get dizzy when I turn to go to the board and sometimes have had to put my hand out to steady myself against the board before writing on it.  Not major disruptions, but strange to me.  I don&#39;t take much in the way of medications, ever.  I might take an aspirin once in a while, but I don&#39;t take any regular meds or have any other health issues.  Just wanted to put this on the record.  Thank you.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Within the first minute after injection, I started to feel dizzy and I felt like I was having a hot flash.  For a few minutes I continued to get warm and at about the 10 minute point I was taken to the waiting room where I got a drink of water.  After drinking the water I felt much better and soon felt normal with the exception of discomfort at the injection site.  (My left upper arm just below my shoulder)  After six days now, I still feel fine overall however, if I message the injection site, I can still feel a little bit of discomfort.

The patient&#39;s airway did not completely close up as he was able to respond and talk to me. Called 911 and administered 10mL (25mg) of Diphenhydramine and gave the patient a bottle of water. He was already worked up as he was scared of needles. He continued to breath better but still had difficulty. The EMT arrived in under 5 minutes as they were already on a call close by and was rerouted. EMT administered breathing treatment and took vitals and eventually took the patient to the hospital as a precaution. (Technician administered vaccine)

The patient quickly became completely unconscious and was helped to the floor.  The patient was presenting with seizure like symptoms, foaming at the mouth and loss of body functions.  Patient remained unconscious for 1 minute or less before regaining consciousness.  He was able to speak immediately after.  Patient had a rapid heart rate and was sweating.  Patients blood pressure was elevated as well.  Patients blood sugar was tested and was 146.  911 was called immediately at time of emergency and when they arrived they help that patient sit up.  They took the patient to the emergency room since he did not immediately regain all functions and this vitals remained elevated.

                                                Around 7:00 P.M. on March 12, 2021 approximately 9 hours after receiving the Jansen COVD-19 vaccine in my left arm. I developed extreme fatigue, muscle aches, skin hurt to the touch of anything including clothing, headache, and fever 101.5.  I had to go to bed and was very weak.  I took ibuprofen and Tylenol for the discomfort.  I slept 14 hours and was able to get up at 11:00 A.M. on March 13, 2021.  The soreness at the site of the injection is not problematic.  There were other odd symptoms overnight I would awake with strange nerve like sensations tingling and itching that occurred on the bottom of the left foot, upper lip, and neck.  I also had several episodes of restlessness that was so bad that I had to stand for a few minutes before being able to lay down again.  The worst is the skin hurting and headache.  I have also had a few dizzy episodes since getting out of bed this morning.  It passes if I sit down or hold onto something.  None of these symptoms are normal for me and I cannot remember having a reaction to any vaccinations that I have received in the past.  I hope this helps with your study.

                                                Pt wanted to test BP prior to shot. Rph said pt BP was a little high so they waited and took BP again a minute or 2 later. BP had gone down some, so they agreed to proceed. After dose, pt was dizzy, sweaty, unresponsive for a short time. Once he was more responsive, we helped him sit on the floor against the wall as he was quite dizzy. We called 911 and pt refused transport to hospital, but was evaluated.

He said he was dizzy. He was at this point dizzy, pale, sweating, low heart rate in the 30&#39;s. We put a cold wet rag on the back of his neck and monitored. We gave him some cold water also. Slowly over the next 5-10 minutes his stats got better, color returned, and was not sweating anymore. He did not feel dizzy anymore.  We monitored for an additional 30 minutes. Gave instructions. Sent home with spouse.

                                                Approximately eight hours after receiving the shot, I started getting a headache, body aches, and chills (April 3rd, 8 p.m.).  I went to bed and had severe chills and body sweats for the entire night.  The primary symptom to report is that my heart raced all night.  It felt like it was beating at about 140 to 150 Hz or higher.  When I woke up in the morning, it felt like my chest had been pounded on all night.  The pain was in my sternum area.  The headache and body aches took a little over a day to go away.  The chest pain took a couple of days to die down.  On April 12th, I walked my dogs in the morning and felt out of breath, which isn&#39;t normal for me.  In the afternoon, while working at my desk at home, I started getting more and more severe chest pain and then started getting dizzy and felt weak.  I drove myself to the local ER and they tested me for a heart attack.  All tests came back negative.  They suggested going to another facility to get checked for clots or to make an appointment with a cardiologist.  The next day, after talking to a doctor friend, he suggested going to the ER facility to get imaged for clots and to get fully checked out.  No cardiologist appointments were available till the next week.  I went to the ER facility and was there for seven hours getting tested.  They came back and said all test results were negative and that my heart looked fine.  They did not have any suggestions for what might be causing the pain in my chest.

                                                After the Covid-19 Vaccine on Mar 26, 2021 I had an adverse reaction to something that may or may not be related.  On Friday, Apr 2, at 2:00pm I felt a weird case of Vertigo that lasted approximately 3 mins.  The next day, Sat. Apr 3, at around 9:30pm I had a longer very severe case of the vertigo.  I went to bed shortly afterwards.  On Sunday,Easter morning April 4, at 6:30am I woke up with a very severe case of vertigo (Meniere&#39;s Disease).  It lasted about 3 hours of sever heaving and extreme dizziness.  I could not cope and had to just lay there not knowing what was wrong/going on.  It finally went away after about 3 hours.  The next morning, Mon. Apr 5, I called my Dr  to make an appointment and went in 2 days later.  There were no other cases of it and he could not figure what caused it and I either could I.  So far so good that I have not had another reaction and feel fine today after nearly 3 weeks.  :-)

I quickly tended to him as he slowly passed out. I craddled his head to make sure he did not hit it on the countertop. Pateint was seated. After approximately 30 second the patient started to come to. We gave him some water, took his bp, had him wait 30mins and took his bp again before he left with his wife.

Then a few seconds later he appeared to lost consciousness, his head fell back, and he started to have jerking movements.   He was making noises that almost sounded like a snore to me right at first, but it was more than likely him gagging on saliva.  911 was called, and his symptoms continued for roughly 30-60 seconds.  EMS took him to hospital where they diagnosed it as vasovagal syncope and just gave him some fluids.

                                                Starting approximately one week after vaccination I started to experience onset of loud  tinnitus primarily in my left ear. I have experienced mild tinnitus for 8 years but this was much more severe. The night of 04/19/2021 I noticed the onset of dizziness which progressed to strong vertigo the morning of the 20th. It was so severe I was unable to work and stayed in bed for the better part of two days. It was accompanied by the increased tinnitus.   I scheduled an appt with my primary care physician for 04/23 and by Thursday 04/22 the vertigo had decreased to a general dizziness with tinnitus in my left ear.  Dr prescribed Meclizine 25mg to me which has not appreciably addressed the symptom which as of 05/21 continues to be a constant mild dizziness with pronounced tinnitus in my left ear. I am planning to see an ENT that specializes in AIED (auto immune inner ear disorder) which I suspect was triggered my my immune system response to the vaccine.   I should note that 8 years earlier I had a milder but similar case of vertigo w tinnitus which was never diagnosed despite extensive testing (vestibular migraine as a diagnosis by exclusion). It gradually subsided over 2 years with only mild tinnitus remaining as a symptom.

                                                Pt. walked to the front of the Pharmacy from the post vaccination waiting area  (4 feet) asking for help because he was dizzy. He was sweating  and having shortness of breath. Pt. was taken to the seat where he fainted. Pt. was laid on the floor with his legs up in a step. He gained consciousness in less than 1 min.  Pt was pale. Pt. was given an alcohol swab to smell. 911 was called. First responders took his blood pressure again and blood sugar. Uncle&#39;s pt. was called and came to the Pharmacy to pick him up to avoid pt. having to drive his car back home.

                                                I got the shot at 10 am, then at about 7 pm I got chills and achy.  I layed down and had a hard time getting up.  When I got up at 10:30 to check and see if I had a fever, I measured it at 103.5 F.  I took 2 tylenol at 10:30 and at 130 am my fever was 102.5.  I just thought this was a larger reaction than what is typical, so I thought I would report it.   Additionally, this mass vaccination site had a number of adverse reactions (within 15 minutes of injection), so I thought I should report this to someone.   Disappointingly it is near impossible to talk to anyone on the phone these days to get or give information.  I called the VAERS phone number, but was on hold for 15 minutes and gave up.

She said my face was drooping, I couldn&#39;t smile or stand.  She called Ambulance.  Ambulance arrived and decided symptoms of stroke and called for helicopter to take me to medical center.   When I arrived they did CT and I was later told it showed possible areas of no oxygen to brain.  They gave me TPA drug and almost immediately  I could see improvement - my headache cleared.  Throughout the next couple hours I regained movement on right side and all functionality returned except weakness in right arm.  I stayed in ICU for 24 hours as required after receiving TPA and while additional tests were ran then was discharged on Friday, April 16, 2021

Yesterday, however, I started to have a bad headache at 4 a.m., then felt generally more ill to a level of almost incapacity by evening - bad headache, general weakness, dizziness, some muscle pain, bad nausea. Used Aleve and Ibuprofen and by 11pm started to feel normal again.  By the next morning, I felt fine - tired like I just got over something, but fine.  Not sure it was injection related, but wanted to share.

The joint of my big toe became very swollen and red, painful to the touch and the rest of the front part of my foot also became swollen.  It was difficult to walk or even put pressure on it for 5 days and I treated it with ice, elevation and 600 mg ibuprofen 3X/day.  Symptoms are starting to resolve , but the joint is still swollen and red, though the pain is subsiding.  I am able to walk with a normal gait, though there is still stiffness and some pain.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient had no relevant medical history and was not on regular medication. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805022, and expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, once total administered on 01-APR-2021 on left arm for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  Patient reported that, he received the vaccine on 01-APR-2021. Approximately 2 days after he coughed and felt lightheaded and noticed some lights around his eyes. Approximately 7 days after patient noticed a list of symptoms including a pumping sensation in the right side of his head, left calf soreness, soreness in the ribcage near the heart, a tingling sensation in the fingertips and toes (but not at the center), sense of tiredness, shortness of breath, blood in stool that he referred to repeatedly as clots, right arm soreness (although the injection was given in the left arm). Patient called his doctor twice and was told to go to the hospital. Patient went to the hospital on 04-MAY-2021. Arrived at 12 PM and discharged at 11 PM approximately. Conducted a chest x-ray, took a blood sample twice, and put some stuff on patient&#39;s chest. Patient was discharged on 04-MAY-2021 and given a prescription for Motrin 800 mg taken three times per day as needed, and for cyclobenzaprine 10 mg taken twice a day as needed for spasms. Patient decided not to take these medications as he was unsure if they were pain medications and felt apprehensive. He main concerns seemed to be the pumping sensation in the right side of his head and the blood in his stool which he repeatedly referred to as a clot. His family doctor is aware of the situation and says he thinks its hemorrhoids. He refers to the clot as darker red in colour and also mentions that there is regular red blood in stool alongside the darker clot. Patient notices this about 3 times per week. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from coughing, and light headedness sensation on 03-APR-2021, was recovering from right arm soreness, and had not recovered from pumping sensation in right side of head, soreness in the ribcage near the heart/left calf soreness, tingling in the fingertips and the toes, tiredness, shortness of breathe, blood in the stool, and hemorrhoids.

                                                Fevers started on Wednesday evening, April 14th. Over the next three to four days, the fevers and chills continuously got worse. Patient experienced fatigue, congestion, headaches, sore throat, body aches, neck pain. Conducted a televisit on Sunday, April 18th, and then went into the doctor on Monday, April 19th. The day of the doctor appointment, the patient could not get out of bed and could not stand for longer than 15 minutes at a time before extreme fatigue set in. Blood tests were taken at the doctor, a Z-pack was prescribed. The evening of the 19th, the doctor called after hour to send patient to emergency room to be admitted to hospital. Patient went immediately to Medical Center at which point, the patient was admitted for the next 19 days. The patient was released from the hospital on Saturday, May 8th. While in the hospital, the patient saw almost every &#34;category&#34; of doctor possible. Patient experienced fevers every night for 15 days straight, and after release from the hospital and &#34;fever free for 4-5 days, experienced fevers again for the next week. Doctors were unable for the first two and a half weeks of hospitalization to draw a conclusion about what was the cause of the sepsis (systemic). Patient received daily blood tests, MRIs, CAT scans, spinal tap, bone marrow biopsy, echocardiogram, etc. Patient spent the first two and a half weeks on an antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral.  The &#34;final&#34; diagnosis, which is still not confirmed, as histoplasmosis, which per the doctor would not have placed the patient in the hospital. Determined the fevers were officially &#34;fevers of unknown origin&#34; with a diagnosis of MIS-A and a vaccine contributing factor. Medication put patient in kidney failure and did not address the fevers (patient had fevers of 103&#43; for 25&#43; days in a row).  On May 27th, doctors are conducing new fungal tests and patient is discontinuing antifungal medication because of severe liver damage.  Patient was not and is not in a situation where histoplasmosis is a logical conclusion based on the patient&#39;s daily activities.

                                                First 4 hours post injection no serious side effects, slight headache was settling in.  At approx. 8PM (7 hours after shot) I had fairly a severe reaction of horror for the next 16 hours - all night long.  Heart racing/energy beyond, deep chills and severe whole body shaking to the point of my back going out (dont&#39; have a bad back), fever, migraine headache so bad (i dont get headaches) and body aches from a horror movie.   I&#39;m a jock, run daily, healthy, no smoke, drink or drugs. This lasted all night long well into the morning. At 3Am i considered going to the ER, but didnt. By 2pm the following day most of it went away. Two days later (today) i am dizzy, heart feels fast or racing, naseuous earlier , and exhausted. I can deal with it now, but it&#39;s very uncomfortable. Frankly, I regret getting the vaccine, wish i had not.   I had covid last March, it was no big deal beyond what a flu would have done...with some shortness of breath on and off for a few months. The reaction to the vaccine is viccious compared to covid itself (for me, just my experience). Hope this all stops and goes away.   Thank you for your work!

On the 23rd he had to be taken into the hospital in an ambulance. He said he felt as if his lower body was separated from his torso, and visible was having trouble walking. They prescribed him Valium, preformed an x-ray, and sent him home.  On the 27th he was taken back to the hospital due to leg weakness, tingling in his hands and feet, and extreme pain. He was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome. He passed away April 6, 2021 after spending 11 days in the hospital, and 6 days on a ventilator.

Duration of blackout unknown. Woke up on floor not knowing how I got there. Sat up, nausea and lightheadedness returned, then dissipated with no further blackout. Felt rush of blood from head to toe and felt okay after that. Pharmacy staff took blood pressure, readings were close to normal (slightly elevated). Paramedics were called by pharmacy, and their BP readings were also close to normal. After all that, aside from some fatigue, no other appreciable side effects over the next 48 hours. No nausea, flu-like symptoms or fever, and very little soreness at injection site.

                                                the day after the shot, started feeling unwell (approx 24 hours post shot). Slurring words, stumbling around and general unwell feeling with a fluttery feeling in chest. No previous heart issues of any kind. After it continued for an hour or so, I took him to the ER and it was discovered that he was in AFIB. 2 rounds of meds and tests, but stayed in that rhythm. They ended up doing a cardio version and it went back into normal sinus rhythm. Follow up with dr, placed on Eliquis, EKG, stress test and sleep study have found no other contributing factors atthis point.

                                                Five weeks (05/16/2021) after receiving the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, my left leg just started feeling numb. I went into my kitchen and all of a sudden I started feeling dizzy. I lost all strength in my legs and in my left arm. I really couldn&#39;t move my arms or my legs and I felt really light headed. I had to have my 5 year old boys get me some water to drink. My son noticed that my heart was beating really strong and really fast. I saw water boiling over in the pot on the stove and I couldn&#39;t even get out of a chair to turn it off. I couldn&#39;t stand up. I finally managed to go back by my bed from the chair and slowly moved around. I tried holding my phone and it dropped out of my hands a couple of times because I couldn&#39;t hold it. A couple hours later, I felt a little better, but I had to fight to get around. We fell asleep and when I woke up, I still felt bad. I took my children to school and told them that I was going to the hospital to get checked out. At the hospital they performed multiple tests and they back showing I had stroke. I was treated for suffering from a stroke.

                                                Approximately 4 minutes after the injection, while sitting down, I felt light headed, sweating, weak, face turned white. I was close to passing out but didn&#39;t. I requested attention after about 10 minutes. While being treated by medics they mentioned color had returned to my face. I felt better enough so I refused to go to hospital and was driven home. Later that morning, 03/08/2021 about 10 AM, I developed a fever and body aches with sharp pains thru out my body and joints. First temperature check was 100.5. My fever, pains/weakness increased thru out that day and overnight with chills. Highest temp check was 102.8 that evening prior to bedtime. I don&#39;t know if it could have been higher at some point overnight. It felt like I had a moderate to bad case of the FLU. The next morning, 03/09/2021 the fever broke down to about 101. By 03/11/2021, aside from a little residual weakness I felt more like myself. However, as of the writing of this report my temp seems to fluctuate between normal and 99.8. Will report this to my Doctor on next visit. Worth noting that I haven&#39;t had any Flu like symptoms to that degree in many years.

Then, without warning, I passed out, while driving on the freeway. Fortunately, I did not hit anyone, or was hit by anyone, and must have bounced off guardrails after crossing traffic twice and going off the freeway into the middle of an off ramp, where I finally came to. I did not suffer any injuries in the accident.

The next morning after my J&amp;J vaccine, my left leg started hurting more and I could not ambulate. My left hip was hurting so bad I could not sleep at night. I went to the doctor 03-17-2021 to get monitored and he said it could be arthritis. I was prescribed by Dr.  cyclobenzaprine 10mg and naproxen 500mg. I feel that my pain is inside the joint, hip pain region and to this day, I still have sleeping problems due to my pain in my left leg and left hip pain since the J&amp;J vaccine. I will have a  follow up with Dr. in the coming weeks.

                                                Immediately after injection significant arm pain that resolved quickly. Approximately 36 hours after injection dizziness. 48 hours after injection neck and head pain on left side, arm soreness, and swollen lymph node on left side of throat. Minor pain in mouth and throat with fatigue and dizziness. Neck and head pain decreasing on day 3 with all other effects resolving but injection site is still fairly sore. Overall, I would say this was probably a normal response associated with my immune system reacting to the injection. I had the virus the first week of December 2020. I would classify my infection as moderate. I was sick with fever, chills and severe body aches and it lasted for 10-14 days.

I stood up to look for a drinking fountain then woke up on the floor surrounded by people. Blood pressure was 80/40. Spent next two hours in ER on an IV. I was released once BP came back up.  After getting home, I developed chest pain on the left side which I still have after three days so far.

                                                The night after the shot, I started feeling some pain in my right leg from about the hip down the thigh. It got progressively worse and I was actually having difficulty standing. It peaked around Monday, but as of today (Friday 4/16/2021) it is definitely still there. However, it is diminishing in pain. I think it will go away with time so I haven&#39;t seen a doctor yet. I don&#39;t experience leg pain so this was a surprise. I thought maybe I perhaps slept in a wrong position but I would assume it would go away. I don&#39;t see any discoloration in the area.
