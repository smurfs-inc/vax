                                                He got the vaccine, was not able to breath real good and didn&#39;t think about it.  It got to the point within 2 weeks that he was not able to get up from the chair due to the shortness of breath.  By 4/1/21 he was not able to breath very well, but continued to stay home.  Then by 4/12/21 he was not able to breath well at all and his wife took him to the ER.  In the hospital they did x-rays and found out that his lungs are full of blood clots and both legs have blood clots in them.  He was admitted and gave him Heparin drip for the 2 days to get the blood clots dissolved and was also on oxygen for 2 days.  He was discharged home yesterday with Xarelto, and was told that he would be on that for the rest of his life, and is on oxygen for sleep and when he&#39;s up and around, but if he&#39;s resting and feels he&#39;s breathing okay he can remove it.   They informed him that it would take approximately 2 months for all the blood clots to dissipate, and that he was full of blood clots, and had both legs and both lungs which are quite full.

That night: halucinatory dreams, woke up  and had difficulty with orientation - room spinning, difficulty walking came back to bed, bed spinning.  Got up later room spinning vertically - took several minutes to settle down.  This problem has gotten worse as the days go by.  This morning, dizziness persists longer than before, feeling of strong nausea, near vomiting, cannot walk in a straight line.  Fear of falling.   These are symptoms of vertigo I believe.  Should I go to a doctor?  Feeling that this will get worse.  Difficulty concentrating.  Quite an unsettling and scary experience.

Daughters noticed he was having progressive difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, and generalized weakness. O2 sats were also noted to be lower than normal with pulse oximeter at home (92% compared to baseline of 95%). On day of admission patient had a mechanical fall while carrying a tray with his walker.  Hypoxic to 88% on arrival. Labs notable for leukocytosis (13.68), hyponatremia to 127 and negative infectious workup. CTH with chronic microvascular changes and global atrophy but negative for acute process. He was admitted and continued on prednisone 5mg daily (outpatient regimen). Patient was started on a three day course of IVIG on 5/3/21 due to concern for myasthenia exacerbation with subsequent improvement.
