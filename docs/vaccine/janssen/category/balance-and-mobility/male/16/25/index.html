                                                After a few hours, developed a low grade headache and some soreness at the injection site.  About two hours later I started getting extremely cold, despite the temperature in the mid-high 70s. I covered up under blankets. I began feeling very tired and a general sick feeling. After about an hour and a half of progressively worse chills and cold sweat, I began to get very very hot and removed all blankets and eventually clothes. I took my temperature, which was at 102 f. At this point I drank some water and Gatorade and waited for it to pass. I also noticed that my Apple Watch heart rate detection was saying my heart rate was in the high 90s to low 100s despite me just laying in bed. This was alarming because my typical resting heart rate is in the low 60s. About two hours later I felt well enough to at least brush my teeth, but upon standing up was greeted with an extreme feeling of weakness and dizziness and it was hard to keep myself up right. I eventually was able to fall asleep, and upon waking up, felt better, but still not great. My heart rate was more normal at this point, I no longer had chills or a fever, but still had a headache and soreness across my body, worst at the injection site.

                                                Patient felt light headed and dizzy and passed out briefly following administration of vaccine. Patient had history of passing out during vaccination and blood draws. Patient felt sweaty and turned white. His color returned after a minute, I talked to his mother who was there during the incident. Did not eat or drink the morning of vaccine. I checked his pulse and blood pressure and it was 129/72 and pulse of 78. We gave him some water and orange juice. He felt much better. Then his mom bought him some muffins. He sat and ate for about 30 minutes and left feeling back to normal.

He remained on the floor until paramedics arrived. Paramedics took his vitals and observed him for a period of time. They said it was fine for him to leave with someone else to drive him. While waiting for family to arrive the patient began to have a seizure. Paramedics returned and this time they took the patient for further care.

                                                Patient received vaccination and immediately felt uneasy (nauseous, lightheaded). The patient leaned over and became quiet and was not responding to questions. Patient then leaned back up and went stiff and had symptoms similar to that of a seizure (arms and legs went stiff and was unresponsive to questions) for about 30-60 seconds (at this time the paramedics had already been called). Patient then regained control and felt awful (a 5 on a scale of 1-10) and then felt even more nauseous and had to spit up into a trash can. Patient was given a water bottle to help them relax and cool off because patient felt warm. Paramedics arrived and checked blood pressure and pulse but found everything within normal ranges except for a slightly low blood pressure. The paramedics did nothing else except offer a scan of the patient&#39;s heart in their ambulance which he was then rolled out on a stretcher.

                                                Patient immediately reported the shot hurt more than usual shot and that he was feeling dizzy (he described it as &#34;the spins&#34;).  He stated getting warm to the touch and started sweating profusely. About 4-5 minutes after the shot he said he was nauseous. About a minute later he threw up.  He said that throwing up helped a little. RPh asked if he wanted some orange juice. He said he did and he took a few sips. He continued to feel warm to the touch and was sweating quite a bit. He also was quite pale.  RPh continued to monitor him, providing cool compresses to forehead and back of neck and continued to have him sip on orange juice (drank about 20 ounces aver 30 minutes).  He reported feeling better at 10:45am (about 30  minutes after shot.) RPh kept him for observation for another 15 minutes at which time he felt good enough to go home. Girlfriend drove him home. RPh called to check on patient at 6pm. Girlfriend reported he was doing ok and hadn&#39;t had any other reactions. He had just been sleeping all day.

We were able to contact a friend of his and she was able to go to his dorm room and they called the campus on call nurse line. After speaking with her she instructed them to call 911 because she thought he could possibly be having a stroke. Patient was transported by ambulance to ER.

Subsided largely, but chills started and became more heightened after strenuous exercise later in the day. After 3 hours of sleep, awoke the next day with chest pain and difficulty moving. Heart rate (normally 60) spiked to 140 and could not see fit five seconds, had to call ambulance. Ambulance determined much of it was due to anxiety (multiple exams and significant work were due soon), and recommended medical supervision to ensure it did not escalate. Went to urgent care and was supervised until 1 pm, 24 hours after the vaccination, by which time symptoms had subsided

Following this, the patient described the sensation of &#34;blanking out&#34;. The pt fell off their chair and lacked alert conconciousness for roughly five seconds. When the pt came to, they appeared confused and twitchy, with wide eyes and an overall appearance of shock. Pt remained in their state for roughly a minute, before stating that they felt completely better. The pt had developed a sweaty back but didn&#39;t state that they felt overally hot. They didn&#39;t mention being in any pain. The local injection site appeared a bit red but nothing of significant note. Pt did bump their head on the side wall behind the chair, receiving a minor bruise. Pt was given some water to drink and was monitored for 30 minutes. They pt stated they felt fine. They had no past history of fainting with vaccines, thought pt claimed to have passed out like this before but only after suffering a head injury. After their wait, the pt was allowed to leave and assured us that they felt completely fine.

                                                About 3 mins after Janssen vaccine was given, pt was very white and faintish.  I rushed out of pharmacy and had a tech call 911.  As I was running to him pt started slipping out of his chair, as a women, who I later found out was his mother and I helped keep pt in chair as he fainted and then seized for about 2 seconds and then gained consciousness. Upon awakening pt said , what  just happened?&#34; The mother answered &#34;oh you just had a little seizure, you&#39;re fine.&#34; To my surprise, I asked the mother is this has happened before and she said yes when he sees needles/get shots.  I told them the ambulance was on it&#39;s why and the mother asked &#34;why?!&#34; I told her because your son just fainted/had a seizure and we want to make sure he is ok.  The pt refused to go to the hospital.  I did go back out there and mentioned to them that it is very important to answer questions truthfully any time they are asked as they failed to honestly answer our questions about ever feeling faint after receiving a vaccine. His blood pressure normalized and once the paramedics left so did they.

Patient was fine immediately post administration in the IMZ room but witness stated he fell sideways (within a few minutes of receiving the vaccine) out of post-administration observation chair (which is in front of the pharmacy). Technician called code white and patient was immediately met with management and the pharmacy team. Patient was laying on his stomach on the floor, supporting himself upward with both hands/forearms. Patient had blood dripping from forehead and nose. Gauze was applied to laceration on forehead to help with bleeding and once patient was able to roll over on his back, an ice pack was applied to his forehead/nose area. Patient said he felt &#34;pain&#34; after the injection and then he felt light-headed. He remembered blacking out for a few seconds. Patient stated he felt &#34;ok&#34;, then later stated he felt better but just had a bad headache. Patient stated he felt &#34;it starting to hurt&#34; and that it triggered his anxiety. Dad was in the store and arrived a few minutes later; dad said son/patient has a &#34;fear of needles&#34; and &#34;he hasn&#39;t had anything to eat today in quite awhile&#34;. EMS arrived to examine patient and asked him if he needed to go to the ER; dad felt going to the ER was for the best since they had a 3 hour car ride home. Paramedics then transported patient to the ER and said he would likely need a stitch for the cut above his eyebrow.

                                                The patient had a needle phobia and was very anxious prior to the vaccine. Once the patient received the vaccine, he waited in the waiting area for 15 minutes post-vaccine. About 5 minutes after the vaccine, he notified the pharmacy staff that he wasn&#39;t feeling well and he was feeling faint. The pharmacy staff provided him with a glass of water and was monitoring him. He said he  felt like he fainted and wasn&#39;t feeling well. He said he felt warm and sweaty. The pharmacy staff provided him with an ice pack. He then notified the pharmacy staff that he urinated in his chair while waiting post-vaccine. He wanted to be checked out and wanted us to call 911 . The patient began to feel better after about 20 minutes. The EMT arrived and checked the patient. Even though, the patient was feeling better, the EMT recommended the patient be checked further anyways. He was brought to the Triage center and was there for about 1 hour, according to the patient, and was feeling better. He said he felt slightly fatigued that day and the following day, but other than that he was feeling back to normal and no issues. He stated he has severe needle phobia and has experienced these fainting spells and anxiousness in the past. We followed up with the patient and he provided this information to us. He stated he was feeling good and back to normal. He had no further questions or concerns. We told him to follow up with us if questions or concerns came up.

                                                Patient was given vaccine and was told to wait in the monitoring area for 15 minutes post vaccination. Shortly after, the patient reported &#34;feeling pale&#34; and was told to remain seated. The patient then fell over from the chair and lost consciousness. We immediately called 911 and went to the patient&#39;s side with epinephrine. However, he recovered within seconds and was able to sit up and drink water.  He reported feeling &#34;pale [...], weird [...]&#34; and said he felt like his &#34;ears are sweating.&#34; He did not want epinephine and remained seated and responsive. When asked, he said he had never received any adverse reactions to any vaccines in the past. A pharmacist then cleaned and disinfected his right temple that was bleeding, which he seemed to have hit when he fell. He later reported feeling chest pain and slight difficulty breathing but did not want epinephrine at that time. Emergency services arrived about 20 minutes after and assessed the patient and removed him in a gurney.

Patient recovered consciousness about 10-15 seconds later and complained of feeling dizzy and light-headed. Wet paper towels were applied to patient&#39;s neck wrist and forehead for 5 minutes but he still felt light headed. Patient then was instructed to lie on the floor and elevate his feet on a chair.  After doing this for 5 minutes he felt well enough to sit in the waiting/observation area for another 10 minutes after which he felt well enough to leave.

                                                Pt collapsed right after sitting down after receiving the vaccination. I went out and asked patient to stay on his back a nd raise his legs. He seemed confused and got up. As he appeared very unsteady and confused, I wrapped my arms around his torso so he would not fall. I asked him to lie down and he walked over to the chairs and sat down. I again asked that he lie down, but he stayed in the chair. He seemed lucid after a few minutes and asked for something cold water to drink. He was lucid at this point and took a small sip. He was sweating profusely and explained that he has  had this reaction before to  events and said it had happened when he witnessed a large gash on his brother&#39;s leg. I believe this was a situational reaction and not really related to the vaccination, as he had been vaccinated numerous times in the past. I had him wait 30 minutes and checked on him several times. He left on his own with a girl and another gentleman when the 30 minutes was over.

Checked pulse and it  was 75. After sitting for approximately 15 minutes, he was able to sit up without problem. He was not dizzy and I observed  no restriction in movement to indicate hypotension.  While laying down he stated the inside of his mouth felt tingly which happens when he is nervous. At about the 15m mark, patient was able to drink fluids (mother purchased a drink from cafe) and felt immediately better.     Prior to administration, hestated that he has never had a vaccine reaction. He did state following injection that he felt the needle. He tensed his arm muscle as I was about to vaccinate. He said he felt the needle which made him feel a little nervous. I asked to observe him for another 15 minutes, but mother wanted to take him home. Offered to get him a scooter, but patient and mother refused. Techincian offered to walk him to the door to make sure he was safe and had no issues walking while mother brought car around. He was under constant observation.

He said he had chest pain and was 2 on a scale of 1-10.  We took his blood pressure. it was 110/80. We asked him at least 3 times if he wanted us to call an ambulance.  He said no.  After 30 minutes, he was feeling much better.  5 minutes later he left with his girlfriend driving.  I called him about 7:30pm, he felt back to normal.

She fell on her right said on to the floor. I conducted a physical assessment for bruises, bleeding, broken bones, etc. as well as assessment for breathing and pulse. She was responsive to commands. We followed our emergency protocol and called EMS, who arrived within 5 minutes to further assess the patient. They obtained BP, pulse, and blood sugar readings (I am not aware of the results of those readings). Patient denied emergency transport to hospital, and left the facility about 30 minutes after vaccination with her mother to drive her.

After approx 1 minute patient leaned to his right side, so we decided to place him on the floor. Patient alternated between supine and right side. Patient reported feeling nauseas, so he was given an emesis bag. No vomiting occurred, but there was a fair amount of sputum he expelled. He denied any shortness of breath, heart palpitations, or chest tightness. 911 was called after the patient&#39;s mother requested we do so. EMS responders evaluated patient, and by the time they were done evaluating (approx 30min later) patient was sitting and talking without any further symptoms/complaints. Patient was offered transport for further evaluation via EMS, both patient and his mother declined.  Patient stayed at pharmacy for several minutes (approx 15) after EMS left.

                                                The patient began experiencing nausea and light-headedness around 11:00 P.M. on the 6th of April. Three hours later, he reported lower back pain that steadily increased in severity over the course of several hours. Throughout that same night, severe headaches and impaired kidney capacity (i.e. constant need to urinate about every hour) kept him from sleeping longer than two or three hours. Come morning of the 7th (roughly 8:30 A.M.), he took a single capsule of ibuprofen and performed various lower back stretches in addition to walking around the house. During this time, he experienced a gradual decrease in symptoms and was able to eat a small meal. The patient returned to bed two hours after taking the medication and slept without any further interruptions.

His blood pressure was going up every time we checked. He continued to ask for water, and he drank another cup of warm water. After about 10 min, he felt better and able to walk without dizziness.

Tuesday after the vaccine I got diarrhea with constipation along side the fatigue. Those symptoms lasted throughout Thursday. Friday night after the vaccine I got small haves around my head, neck, and upper back that would not away after an hour or two. That continued throughout Saturday and midday trough Sunday. Sunday I had shortness of breath after moving some water bottle cases around and lightheadedness along with the small hives at around 2pm I went to the ER to get checked out. Doctors said it was a reaction caused  by the vaccine. They gave me Benadryl for the reaction and injected me with a &#34;Steroid&#34; to the my upper buttock. I don&#39;t remember the name of what they injected with me. It is now Monday April 19th a day after the ER and I feel much better. The Benadryl made the  hives go away.

Slept the rest of the night. Felt tired and with a slight headache, similar to that of a sinus infection, coming and going throughout the next day (April 11), so stayed in bed. Symptoms were gone by the night. No more symptoms starting on April 12 and after that date.

I had already instructed him to sit on the floor if he started feeling faint  as he stated previous fainting episodes as a kid. He sat on the floor, then laid on the floor. I brought him a garbage can in case he got sick, an ice pack, wet paper towels, and a bottle of water. After 5 minutes or so the color came back to his face and he started feeling much better. He then sat back in the chair, then stood up and stated he was feeling back to normal. I asked him to stay standing an extra minute just to make sure he was good, then he left with the woman who was with him during the vaccine.

                                                I gave a 21yo male a Janssen vaccine approximately 508p on 5/15. Vaccination was routine and the patient walked to the observation chair.  Around 520p, an acquaintance of the patient came up asking for a vomit bag.  I went out to the observation chair with a small trash can and paper bag and at 522p the patient stated he felt dizzy and vomited.  My technician stayed with the patient, and I went to the pharmacy to grab paper towels, a new mask, and a bottle of water. I came back and asked the patient how he was feeling (524p). He said that he felt much better after vomiting. I asked if he wanted a cold pack or water, and he took the bottle of water and denied the cold pack. I asked him to continue to stay for observation. At 537p, I went out to see how the patient was feeling.  He stated he was feeling better and was no longer dizzy. At 538p (30 minutes after vaccination) the patient stated he felt comfortable to leave and continue shopping in the store with his acquaintance.

                                                Patient received Janssen COVID19 vaccine (LOT#201A21A) in his left arm at approximately 14:43 on 5/25/21. During the 15 minute observation period, he expressed &#34;I don&#39;t feel well&#34; and endorsed dizziness/ lightheadedness, slight tingling feeling in fingers, and nausea. Shortly thereafter at approximately 14:50, he started to slouch and appeared faint while sitting in a chair with eyes closed. He did not fall or hit any part of his body. He was easily aroused with a touch on his arm and responded to verbal questions immediately. He denied trouble breathing, chest pain, palpitations, headache, muscle weakness, vision changes, skin reactions, swelling. He was oriented x3 and not exhibiting verbal or swallowing problems. His vitals were normal- HR 80 bpm and BP 105/80 mmHg. He was offered a receptacle to vomit in if needed; however, he did not vomit. This initial reaction was consistent with potential vasovagal reaction/ near-syncope after vaccination.   Patient was encouraged and instructed to sit on the floor to prevent injury in case of fall but he refused. Staff offered him water, a fan, and opened windows while monitoring.   Later while waiting for a ride at around 15:10, he endorsed headache (first above his eyes and then toward the back of his head) and clarified this did not feel like a typical migraine that he has had before. Then at around 15:20 he endorsed vision changes in his right eye- he could not see a portion of vision out of that eye except peripheral vision and described not being able to see writing on the right side of a whiteboard in front of him in the room. Later he described a resolution of that gap in vision but then had blurry vision out of that eye. He denied any vision changes in the left eye.   Due to alarming symptoms of vision changes and onset of headache, patient was recommended to go to ER for further observation and evaluation. He was not in urgent distress and patient did not wish for EMS to be called but agreed to go to ER when his emergency contact picked him up.    Patient&#39;s emergency contact came to pick up patient at approximately 15:40 and was recommended to take him to the ER. Patient and emergency contact were amenable to this plan. He was able to stand up and walk to the car without issues.

A few minutes later, he started feeling lightheaded and called his father. His father notified me that he was &#34;spazzing out/seizing&#34; with his head jerking backwards &#34;for a couple seconds&#34;. When I saw the patient, he was sitting and unresponsive to verbal and physical stimuli with his father patting his cheek. After a minute or so, the patient was able to respond, but his voice was faint. He reported having a &#34;severe headache&#34; and feeling &#34;sweaty&#34;. He had no fever or difficulty breathing. Father said there was no anaphylaxis, and asked for a bucket since the patient felt very nauseous. I then called 911 for emergency services. When I returned to the patient after the call, the father said he was feeling much better and that the &#34;color had returned&#34;. Patient was unwilling to stand, and remaining symptom(s) was headache. Emergency services came and checked blood pressure, which was normotensive (SBP 111). Father insisted ER visit was not necessary.

Employee got out there and he was a bit combative and saying &#34;whats going on, whats going on&#34;. I asked him to sit down and employee called 911. We put pressure on his eye area to stop the bleeding. He was sweating, shakey, pale, and nauseous. Paramedics arrived quickly and eventually took him away on a strecher. Update: mom came back a couple of hours later to thank us and let us know that he is home and resting. He did get 3 stiches by his eye and the reason they took him via strecher was because his blood pressure was staying so low while they were here.

                                                Patient was given a Janssen Covid 19 shot on 7/5/21 around noon. After the shot we talked about different side affects and he had a few questions about adverse reactions. I had him sit down for 15 minutes while I finished his paperwork. As i was walking back from the immunization room toward the pharmacy I saw him drop his phone and he fell to the ground. I tried to reach for him but was not close enough to break his fall. I saw his eye roll back and his face turn very red. He was breathing very fast and loud. He regained consciousness and I told him 911 way on the way and to please try to relax his breathing. His brother was with me the whole time talking to him and reassuring that everything was ok. The paramedics came and hooked up a monitor. They were asking all sorts of questions to everyone in the area. I went back into the pharmacy and he walked out to the ambulance with his family and was taken to the hospital.

Patient reported feeling dizzy and was very pale. He did not lose consciousness. We helped him to a chair and observed him for another 30 minutes. He was given some water and candy. After 30 minutes, the color returned to his face and he reported feeling better.

Pt did not lose consciousness but blacked out (visual disturbances, tinnitus/temporary hearing loss, nausea) occurred within 2-3 minutes of administration. First attempt to read BP was low (~80/60). Pt is an athlete, so I waited until after water was consumed to take BP again. 2nd reading was ~106/65. Pt felt better after drinking water and after sitting for 15 minutes under observation.

Then the inside of my chest started getting really hot and my vision started going white in both of my eyes, it took about 10 seconds for me to completely lose vision. Then I passed out, I have no idea how long I was out for but when I came too I had a sort of epileptic-type seizure but I do not know how long it lasted. I woke up completely disoriented, had no idea where I was at and had a severe cognitive dysfunction. I still have moments where I just can&#39;t follow or complete a thought or just kind of go blank.

I asked him to sit down and started walking around the counter to check on him and check his blood pressure. At that moment he fainted and lost consciousness. Another patient caught his head and he did not hit his head. He remained unconscious for 30 seconds and we were preparing to start CPR breaths as he had a pulse but was not breathing.  His eyelids were fluttering.  He regained consciousness at that time and we waited with him until EMS arrived. His blood sugar was very low when EMS arrived.

                                                At around 7PM the day of the J&amp;J vaccine, I began to feel very fatigued and could tell that I was going to come down with a fever. I went to bed early that day around 10PM. Woke up around 1:30AM on the 4th. Felt terrible and took my temperature. It read 101.5. Got up to use restroom and when washing hands, everything started to go blurry, I thought i had just become lightheaded and that it would pass so i stood there leaning against the bathroom door.I  ended up fainting and hitting my head on the cabinets. I was completely soaked in sweat.  An hour later we drove to the ER to make sure everything as okay. IV was started, some test performed, and fever was gone by 5AM. Felt completely fine after going home and resting for a few hours.

                                                The patient was standing  in the immunization room with the pharmacist and while he waited for his father to receive his immunization.  As they wrapped up and began to exit the room, the pharmacist noticed that he seemed confused and as if he was about to faint .  The pharmacist got him to the nearest chair.  He never lost consciousness, he was just dizzy.  He was given water and his pulse was taken.  The patient also reported at a later time he had just finished a long shift at work with little to eat or drink.

I was walking across my room and passed out waking up on the floor. Muscle cramps and tightness followed this.  I could not move my muscles for roughly 12 hours. After 24 hours from receiving vaccine these extreme symptoms seemed to fade and I was left with fatigue, soreness and fever as expected. This lasted for the next 3 days

                                                I took a nap after around an hour of receiving my shot at around 1:40pm. Once I awoke at around 6pm, I had irritated eyes, extreme nausea, extreme dizziness, insatiably low body temperature, extreme shivers, migraine because of my head uncontrollably shaking, and dry mouth. I felt like I was in 20 degree weather and nothing I could do would heat my body up. My body grew so tired from the uncontrollable shaking that I could not get out of bed to get my phone to call 911. Every symptom I was experiencing was not mild and was to the level of extreme. This lasted until around 9am. I have been slowly recovering since then (currently almost 9pm) and feel only 70% back to normal.

When safe, he was assisted to WC and taken to clinic where he was observed for a few hours. Patient discharged home with his mother when he was feeling better.

                                                Patient was visibly nervous prior to receiving the vaccine. About 5 minutes after administration (during the 15 minute watch period), patient appeared to be slumped over in the chair. He had eyes closed and seemed to be shaking slightly. Pharmacist and tech grabbed the emergency kit and laid patient on the floor. After a few more seconds the patient woke up and was able to respond to questions. He was very pale, sweaty, reported feeling clammy and dizzy. Patient claimed he had not eaten since the morning. We gave him some water and a pb&amp;j sandwich. Patient stated he felt better and he just gets very nervous around needles. The patient sat with us for another 30 minutes until his grandmother and cousin were able to come pick him up from the pharmacy.

                                                Patient was administered the Janssen COVID vaccine at 403 pm. I returned back to the pharmacy to prep his partner&#39;s vaccine and when I came back at 405 pm, he was loopy with his head swaying. He wasn&#39;t responding to verbal communication by his spouse and me nor through touch as I shook his shoulder. He then lost consciousness and so I lifted his head to check for breathing and pulse which he had. I asked my technician to call 911, and asked my other tech to help me transition him to the floor so we can raise his legs to provide blood flow to his head. Mid-transition, he had a seizure. We brought him completely to the floor and just as I was about to turn him to his side, he regained consciousness. Pupils were dilated, breathing normal, pulse elevated. He also was able to speak immediately and confirmed feeling &#34;okay&#34;. I then had my technician remain outside with him laying on the ground as I returned back inside the pharmacy to call management and my technician was still on the phone with EMS. Paramedics and management arrived within 10 minutes upon which patient was then taken to the hospital. Wife followed and we rescheduled her vaccine.

                                                Pt passed out in chair about a minute or so after administration of vaccine. He brought along his girlfriend who was in the consultation room with him. Prior to administration, pt informed me that he was afraid of needles.  After administration, we discussed the type of needle that was used (vanish point syringe) and the mechanism of how it works. He seemd anxious so I advised that it was ok for them to sit in the room for a few minutes instead of getting up to wait in the lobby, I left the door open for them.  I walked back into the pharmacy and his girlfriend alerted me that he had passed out. He regained conscious within a few seconds. I advised he sit with his head between his legs, as he mentioned feeling light headed, feeling hot and sweaty. he threw up a little into the trash. pt sat in room for at least 30 minutes until he felt better. was given a few cups of water while sitting. did not leave until he felt comfortable and no longer light headed. pt mentioned that his last vaccine was about 2 years ago and the same response occured then.

His blood pressure was 118/82 mmHg, pulse 81 bpm, and respirations 16 bpm.  He said he felt like his throat was closing, so we gave him liquid diphenhydramine. At this point, we called 911. The patient was alert and talking the whole time.  The patient went with EMS. The patient came back later after being released from the hospital and said that he didn&#39;t have an allergic reaction, but he had vasovagal syndrome.

Approximately 10 minuets into  waiting period, patient attempted to stand up and fell. He hit his head against our wall. He was alert and responsive, we called ems, after their evaluation they said patient was okay to leave. We requested the patient to have family member to come pick him up but he insisted to drive back and left.

Shortly after coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and dizziness began and lasted until about 8AM. It was severe enough that I almost went to the ER. But my rescue inhaler was helping to control the coughing some. This was by far the worst ~8 hours of my life. I have never felt anything like it, and I had Covid earlier this spring and it was not nearly as bad.

He stated that he felt dizzy.  He started to jerk his head backwards (911 called) and then his head fell forward, unresponsive.  At his time, we used an ammonia inhalant close to the nose.  He started to move and we brought him to the floor supine with a pillow at his feet and then his head.  Soon, he was able to sit up and we brought him water to drink.  He was subsequently cleared by the EMT to go home.

The pharmacy student that administered the vaccination walked turned to walk away when he heard bumping on the wall of the room. He turned to see the patient with his head back and eyes wide open. He returned to the room and called the patient&#39;s name with no response. The patient at this point had his eyes shut and seemed to slump in the chair. His breathing was labored and then seemed to stop. His pulse was still felt.  The patient was unconscious and seemed to be seizing. An Epipen  administered in the right thigh. The patient seemed to twitch and immediately regained consciousness. At this point the EMT arrived and took over. The patient seemed unaware of the events and was fully recovered.

Pts mom requested an ambulance. He drank a few sips of water and we put cool, damp cloths on his neck.  We considered laying pt flat but he refused saying he was feeling better. His vision cleared, hearing returned , sweating stopped and by the time the fire department arrived he was just shaky. His vitals were all normal by then. He then said now that he thought about it, he flet like it was a panic attack and he almost passed out. i checked on pt again today and he stated that he is now fine.

The next morning (Sunday) I woke up with a fever, chills, sweats, and fatigue that lasted until about 24 hours after I received the vaccine. The following day (Monday) I felt completely fine and had no adverse symptoms or side effects. Tuesday was fine as well until about 2pm after I ate lunch, during a meeting my arm went numb as well as my legs and I had trouble concentrating and could not hold a conversation. Went home and slept until Wednesday morning. Today, Wednesday, I am still not feeling normal and am having trouble concentrating at work, low light seems to help. No numbness today but still feel dazed and not able to focus

As I approach, patient was coming to as he was peeing himself. Patient reported that he felt lightheaded and then did not realize what happened. Gave patient some water and took his blood pressure. His DBP was a little low around 49. Had the patient sit there for another 15 minutes and took blood pressure again and it was 104/60.

He had his eyes open but was unconscious for about 1 minute. Then he released his bladder and peed on himself. The pharmacist noticed and came over then he responded and was consious again. Then he began to sweat excessively all over his body. His face turned pale and the pharmacist began taking his blood pressure which dropped very low. He then began to feel nauseated. Then he started to get body chills. We monitored my husband there for another 30min and he slowly was coming back to his normal self. He had a small headache but was fine enough to leave.

He came around quickly. He had a mark on his head. 911 was called on the scene to evaluate his head injury. Patient declined transport to the hospital and returned home. He was instructed to call 911 or report to hospital if he did not feel well tonight.

                                                Severe body aches, bad headache, bad chills, lack of energy. I woke up at 4:30am the morning after receiving the vaccine needing to use the restroom, but I could barely get out of bed because of my severe body aches and lack of energy. When I did manage to get out of bed, I struggled to even stand up. I took 800mg of ibuprofen at that time (around 4:30am) for the pain, which helped. I spent more than the first half of my day in bed under layers of blankets until about 3:00pm, where I finally felt good enough to get out of bed. I didn?t feel the body aches completely go away until the morning of the 8th, 3 days after receiving the vaccine.

Patient was consulted about what to expect, side effects, and asked if he had any additional questions prior to receiving vaccination.  Patient declined and said he wanted to have the vaccine administered.  Patient sat down in the designated waiting area.  Approximately 2-5 minutes later patient blacked out and his body weight caused the chair he was sitting in to flip over, thus landing on the floor.  EMS was called.  Patient came to about 30-60 seconds later.  Patient was disoriented, sweaty, pale, and shaky.  Blood pressure was taken with a result of 143/95.  EMS arrived and evaluated the patient.  Patient admitted to having nothing to eat or drink today and being very anxious previous to getting the vaccine.  There were no signs of an allergic reaction.  Patient&#39;s blood pressure was checked about 20 minutes later and was returning towards normal.  Patient declined transport to the hospital, but mother was called to come pick him up.  Patient was advised to get something to eat soon and to rest and be observed for the next 24 hours.

                                                The patient after receiving his vaccine, was recommended to take a seat for 15 minutes to observe for any adverse reactions. Very shortly after the shot, he walked up to the counsel window to ask for a bottled water because he was starting to feel faint. As I was trying to suggest he immediately take a seat, he fainted and fell forward into the immunization booth which absorbed most of his fall as he went to the ground and landed almost sitting cross legged. Immediately myself and pharmacy staff laid him flat onto his back and raised his legs above his head where he regained consciousness immediately and stayed laying down for a period of time to make sure he was feeling okay. After a few minutes we gave him a bottled water and had him sit down for 15 more minutes where he claimed he was feeling much better.

                                                Patient had reported previously losing consciousness after vaccination a few years prior.  About one or two minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient lost consciousness and experienced mild convulsions lasting in total about 10 seconds.  His mother was present and explained this was the same reaction he had experienced several years earlier with a previous vaccine.  The patient regained consciousness and reported that he felt dizzy, but otherwise okay.  He appeared clammy and asked for some water.  I gave him a bottle of water, which he drank slowly.  He reported to us feeling the same as he had after the previous vaccine reaction.  As patient was conscious and speaking clearly, I watched him and asked him to wait until he felt comfortable to stand.  At one point he asked to sit on the floor, but was eventually able to sit on the chair again, then move to another chair in our waiting area about 20 minutes post-vaccination.  I asked him to wait for a total of 30 minutes or longer if he felt anything unusual.  At 6:39 approached me and said her son was feeling normal and they would be leaving.

Fever and body aches subsided in the morning, but still don&#39;t feel right and couldn&#39;t exercise.   Brain fog came on about 4:00 after 11:00 am shot. Very difficult to concentrate and do work, found myself walking into rooms and forgetting why. Brain fog is still there today while body aches have subsided, very challenging to focus or work on computer and just feel slow and dumb.

I immediately went over to him, at which point I noticed he was sweating profusely and stated he felt a little light headed. Less than 1 minute afterwards, he stopped talking and his eyes began to roll back, at which point his upper body began to slide over to once side as if he was going to fall. I immediately caught him, motioned for someone to call emergency services  and continued to call him name. He did not respond, was pale and blacked out for about 30 secs. He was still breathing thankfully. When he regain consciousness, he stated that he felt better but he felt some tingling sensation in his forearms bilaterally. Thankfully at this point emergency services were present and upon taking his vitals, realized that his HR and BP were significantly low for someone of his age.

Then regained consciousness but had shaky hands, SOB, and in tears. He was provided with water and asked he may take off the mask if breathing is difficult. Taking the mask ease the breathing a little, but still SOB. Gave him a brown paper bag  to breath into and as him to take deep breath in &amp; out. He did that few times, then regained his normal breathing. Saw him looking down to his phone, which I told him to lift his head up to his eyelevel to decrease the dizziness. Was situated for about at least 30 minutes, then he said he was feeling better and he wants to leave as his friend is outside to pick him up and left.

Submitting  to VAERS following ED visit and admission.  23 y.o. male with no previous past medical history presented 6/10 with complaints of dizziness, presyncope and syncopal episodes.  Initial fainting episode was in January 2021 upon receiving sutures the laceration on his his right index finger.  At the time he reports that although he passed out he did not really lose consciousness as he was aware of his surroundings.  Things seem to go fine for a while until the day after he received his J &amp;J vaccine in April 28, 2021.  Reports having the usual post vaccine symptoms such as myalgias and malaise but the following day  while at the barbershop he reports having another syncopal episode.  He reports a prodromal phase that includes shortness of breath, numbness of the lips and a generalized warm feeling.  During this episode he denied any loss of consciousness, as he was able to unlock his phone and respond to the people around him.  He denies any myoclonic movements or jerks.  He denies any postictal symptoms.  Patient has been seen in the ED 3 times within the last week.  On 6/10/2021 while at the base clinic, he reports feeling like he was about to pass out and was brought to the emergency department for further evaluation.  He denies any nausea, vomiting, headaches.  He endorses some chest pain when he lays down flat that is relieved by leaning forward.  He denies any recent illness.  Denies any new medications or changes to his diet or hydration status.    The day prior to admission, his ED visit for weakness and presyncope occurred shortly after PT eval at the base.  He felt very lightheaded and he attributes that to not eating and drinking prior to the PT eval.     Work-up in the ED included EKG which showed ST elevation in leads V3 and V4 in a biphasic pattern.  CT chest which showed no PE or consolidation pneumonia or pleural effusion.  CMP was remarkable for potassium of 3.4 serum bicarbonate of 21.  CBC was normal.  CK was slightly elevated at 913.  Troponin was negative.  Lactic acid was 1.9.  UA with no concern for infectious process.  UDS was negative.  Due to EKG findings reported above, patient was discussed with cardiologist who recommended that patient be admitted for observation.   Upon further discussion with patient, it was clear that his chest discomfort improved when leaning forward, and his EKG was consistent with diffuse ST elevation.  With a clinical diagnosis of acute idiopathic pericarditis, patient was initiated on colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily and ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.  He is to continue his colchicine therapy for 3 months and his ibuprofen therapy for 1 to 2 weeks with a gradual de-escalation of that ibuprofen by 200 mg/week.  He has follow-up with cardiology scheduled.  Cardiology mentioned in their notes that they would obtain an echocardiogram to rule out structural heart disease and recommended a 2-week event monitor upon discharge with a 3-week follow-up with tilt table testing and exercise stress testing.  Cardiology had high suspicion for possible vasovagal.  Echocardiogram was unremarkable without pericardial effusion.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At 11 PM the night of the vaccine (Saturday), extremely bad chills, fever and weakness set in almost immediately. I could not get my body to warm up and was borderline too weak to walk. Very bad headache and nausea set in as well.  After several hours the chills turned to intermittent sweating/cold and I could not keep a consistent body temp, nor sleep that night. The next morning  (Sunday) I had very bad aches and soreness, along with chills/fever and headaches that could be managed fine with around the clock acetaminophen. Around 8 PM that night, most of these flu like symptoms subsided. The following morning (Monday), still very exhausted despite a full 10 hours sleep. Tiredness and weakness lasted through the day. Tuesday morning until around 3 PM i still experienced drowsiness and was unable to gain strength for anything more than typical day to day tasks (could not workout). Wednesday morning, felt normal but while exercising experienced shortness of breath almost immediately as well as chest/lung pain easily. Come Thursday I feel 90% normal.

At 3:44pm the patient was waving at me indicating that he felt dizzy so I ran out there and he asked for ice and said he was feeling lightheaded and seeing black spots.  I asked him to lay on the floor with his feet elevated in a chair. He stayed that way for a few minutes and said he was feeling better, and we were able to get him a cool pack.  He sat up on the floor and put the cool pack on his neck.  After a few minutes he was feeling better so I allowed him to remain seated in the chair until 4:10pm.  Store management came to get a statement from him and he ended up staying in the pharmacy area for approximately 1 hour post-vaccination.  He waved and thanked us when he left.

                                                At roughly 6 days after vaccination my body developed Hives head to toe. Roughly 18 or so hours after initial hive development I sought treatment for a anaphylactic reaction in my throat and face area. I received a steroid and a Pepcid to calm it down, and was given an epi pen and sent on my way. The following now two plus weeks since then I&#39;ve had episodes of dizziness, shortness of breath and headaches that seem to be constant. There has been almost no relief from these symptoms, however the rash has completely resided. I&#39;ve taken an Aspirin in the mornings to deal with the headaches but strenuous activity seems to bring these on much more prominently.

I immediately ran to the patient and asked if he was ok and he quickly &#34;woke up&#34;. He said he completely dozed off but patient was unconscious for a moment. We checked his blood pressure which was high initially. Patient refused EMS.

                                                At roughly 4pm the day of vaccine I started to feel generally sore in my muscles. At around 7pm I started to become light headed, had a headache, and bad muscle pain. My fever at this point measured 102f. These negative effects increased over the next few hours until I fell on the floor and couldn&#39;t get up without help from my wife. I felt like I was going to pass out every five seconds, threw up twice, my muscles kept contracting and relaxing and were intensely painful. Around 12:30am Saturday morning we went to the emergency department. I needed a wheelchair to get around. The wait at emergency was too long, and by 3am we went back home. I was feeling slightly better, but still not great, and my fever had reduced. I rested on Saturday with less severe but still considerable symptoms, and took paracetamol. Now on Sunday I feel sick and a little sore and very tired, but mostly better.

                                                Patient received the vaccine and was asked to wait in the observation area afterwards.  He approached the counter a few minutes later to report he wasn&#39;t feeling well.  As he was speaking with the technician he became very pale, reported lightheadedness and fainted with loss of consciousness.  The technician reported that he witnessed convulsive type tonic movements concentrated in the neck and upper-arms more than the abdomen or legs.  He also reported foaming at the mouth and following each event which repeated 3 times in less then 15 minutes,  he woke with confusion and no memory of where he was.  EMS arrived after 15 minutes and transported the patient to the ED for evaluation.    Upon follow up with the patient the next day, he reported that the ED found nothing on his medical exam and he had worked a 10 hour shift prior to receiving the vaccine and had had nothing to eat or drink.

These symptoms lasted all night, but felt better in the morning. These symptoms were like COVID but x5. When I had the COVID-19 virus, my symptoms were not as bad as yesterday?s adverse effects from the vaccine. At 3 AM, I was considering going to the hospital and I have never been hospitalized before. I could barely open my eyes since the headache was so bad.

On April 3rd he had non-specific changes in his hands that he attributed to cold weather that led to discomfort when running them under warm water. By monday APril 5th he was having worsening sensitivity in his hands and feet to heat, touch and experienced numbness. he also began to have difficulty walking. He went to the ER April 6th and was discharged April 7th after undergoing MRI of the brain and spinal cord, labs and lumbar puncture, with a presumptive diagnosis of early Guillain-barre Syndrome. His symptoms continued to worse, loss of gait was more pronounced as well as loss of balance and new off sensations in his tongue. He was admitted to the hospital, continued to undergo diagnostic workout. Results from tests on APril 6th came back positive for Anti nuclear antibodies and high protein in his CSF. He was treated with 3 days of infused Immunoglobolin therapy and was discharged on April 11th with a diagnosis of likely GBS.

                                                (Saturday)When I came home after I received the vaccine I didn&#39;t really have anything to do, so I decided to take a nap and rest. I think after I woke up is when I started to feel the side effects. I can&#39;t remember exactly but I started feeling cold. I didn&#39;t think too much of it I just thought it was a cold day (which was quickly turning to night). Later that night I started feelinga bit dizzy and my head was hot but I still had chills. Since I had a had a blanket with me, and I think I was starting to feel what would become muscle aches, I just didn&#39;t want to move from the couch to my room. Feeling chills the rest of the night, I realized it was bad choice, since one of my family members left a window open. The cold air of the night really exacerbated my chills. Despite the cold I was still able to sleep, but the next day (Sunday) I did have a slight cough which I think was from experiencing the cold air of the night and not a side effect from the vaccine. (Sunday) This is when I really felt all the side effects. I felt weak, chills, headache, dizziness, muscle aches,(I&#39;m not sure if I had a fever, I couldn&#39;t think clearly my head felt hot). I haven&#39;t had a hangover but I think that is what it would feel like to have one. I basically slept most of day Sunday ; This time in my room with  3 blankets (light blankets )and heat up (felt like 80°F under blankets). I was sweating under the blankets but it really helped warm me up and alleviate my chills. I woke up later that day to a call to help my sister with some work. I couldn&#39;t drive, felt weak and dehydrated(dark orange/yellow pee), but she insisted so she picked me up and scolded me for not eating anything all day(besides the side effects I mention, I think I may have also lost my appetite because I felt dizzy). I was still feeling my head aching after I woke up, still had muscle aches and a slight cough too. It was raining that day so I put on a winter coat with layers underneath to help with my chills. At her home she gave me a Gatorade (and water) which I think really helped since I was sweating a lot under the blankets when I fell asleep. She also gave me some home cooked meals she made. The combination of drinks, food, and familial concern really helped me recover. By Monday my cough was gone and the side effects had worn off to the point that I could go to work safely.   My mother &amp; father also received vaccine at the same time I got it. My father also experienced side effects but his started later with the most effects felt on Tuesday. My mother did not get any side effects.

He did say that he had not eaten and it was 3:00pm. paramedics soon arrived and removed the patient from the scene.  I did text patient the next day and he said only that he had a sore arm and symptoms consistent with having a vaccine administered.

                                                During the observation period, the patient became lightheaded and dizzy.  He complained of sweating and cold skin.  The pharmacist immediately went to the aide of the patient.  The patient was laid on the ground and we began to get a blood pressure reading.  We also gave the patient cold pack to place on the skin.  The patient never lost consciousness and was verbal and responding to pharmacist questions the entire time.  We asked multiple times if he needed EMS and he each time told us he did not.  His status continued to improve with deep breaths and cooling the skin.  After 10-15 minutes he felt like he could sit up in the chair and did just fine and continued to recover.  We kept watch over him.

After I gave him the vaccine, I directed the patient to sit outside and wait 15 minutes per protocol. As soon as patient got up to walk to outside of vaccination room, he fainted and fell onto the ground hitting his head as well. Patient regained consciousness 5-10 seconds later. I had him sit upright against the wall, I directed my technician to call EMS, and I gave the patient some water. EMS arrived in about 5-10 minutes and they triaged the patient for about 20-30 minutes (given anti-nausea medication, IV fluids, and some other things I didn&#39;t see). Patient&#39;s parent ended up coming to pick up him, EMS was comfortable letting him leave without going to the hospital, EMS advised patient to seek medical attention if other problem arises.

Around 9:00 a.m. or so that same morning, I went to  Emergency room because I was so sick I didn&#39;t know what to do. They said I was just having a reaction to the vaccine, and it should go away in a day or so. They gave me Ibuprofen and Tylenol and a shot of toradol. I was then discharged and went back to my living quarters. I had covid already back on January 20th 2021. But the vaccine was five times worse than the virus.

                                                First felt pressure on right side of head on Tuesday May 4th.  Took Vaccine on Sunday May 9th. Experienced fever, chills, and dizziness until Tuesday May 11th. Noticed head pressure increase and spread to left side of head and top side of head on Thursday May 13th. Noticed head pressure spread to back of head on Friday May 14th. Pressure and tenderness on all sides of head, with pulsating superficial veins make it difficult to sleep, as pain increases in conjunction with amount of time resting head on pillow. ER doc persribed fioricet on Wednesday May 19th. Felt tingling and numbness down left side of body in reaction to it on Friday, May 21st. Visited ER on May 21st, and received migraine cocktail. Helped relieve pain so that I could lay my head down to rest, but did not stop pulsating throbbing of superficial head veins. May 24th, neurologist prescribes steroids for pain and inflammation, and sleep medication so I could sleep. Sleep noticeably improved. Still testing out 50mg dose of steroids. Steroids noticeably do nothing for pulsating throbbing superficial veins.  *Note: I worry this vaccine may have exacerbated the headache I was feeling prior to my vaccination, or that the vaccination was fine, and what I am experiencing now is merely a extension of the headache I was feeling prior to vaccination.

                                                Patient came to Pharmacy today for his J&amp;J vaccine along with his wife who also received her vaccine as well. After I administered the vaccine, the patient got light headed and I asked him if he would like to lay down. Before he could respond, the patient collapsed off his chair hitting the side of the plastic trash bin in our patient care room. I caught him before he hit the ground. I asked if he could hear me after saying his name a few times, no response. I assessed his subjective vitals and could tell he stopped breathing. Called for Pharmacy resident to grab and administer an epi pen. Patient responded within 30 seconds of epi pen administration and started breathing again. Proceeded to call emergency services, first responders arrived within 5 minutes and administered IV fluids and oral ondansetron. Patient left with the ambulance and will follow up tomorrow to make sure everything is ok.

                                                I vaccinated the patient with Janssen Covid 19 vaccine (as patient requested). He was sitting in the observation area when I looked up and noticed the patient looking pale. This was less than 2 minutes after being immunized. As I headed out the pharmacy to check on the patient, he slid out of his chair and I heard his glasses hit the floor. He was unconscious on his stomach, so I rolled him over to his left side. He immediately regained consciousness and tried to get up. I elevated the patient&#39;s feet on a chair while he laid with his back on the floor. The pharmacy technician and another associate called EMS.  Patient was cognizant after 5-7 minutes and answering questions appropriately. When EMS arrived 10 -12 minutes later, patient was laughing and joking with them. Patient has a needle phobia, of which I was aware. Patient was pleasant and appropriate when he while he was being vaccinated, which is why I believe this is a reaction to the vaccine and not from his needle phobia. EMS evaluated the patient and he signed a waiver stating he did not want to go to the hospital. He was instructed not to drive (his companion would drive them home) and to drink lots of water, which he did before leaving. He laughed and joke with myself and the EMS and thanked us numerous times for our care and concern. The whole event lasted about 18 minutes, from patient being vaccinated to leaving with his companion who agreed to drive him home.

They had him chew 4 81mg ASA until the paramedics could arrive. Around 15 minutes after vaccination, he reported chest tightness, he thought he was breathing at 80%, and light sensitivity. Around 20 min post vaccination, EMS arrives and escorted him outside. I never received further info on his condition from EMS. The next day, I tried to reach the patient twice via phone, but there was no answer and no voicemail.

Had insomnia all night.   6:00 am: woke up with bad headache, slight fever.   7:00 am: got out of bed and had vertigo and was running into walls trying to walk to my living room, along with the worst migraine I?ve ever had. Also had dizziness, nausea,  chills, 100&#43;degree fever, aches, skin sensitive to touch, and severe tinnitus. All of the veins were visibly popping out of my head.   As the day went on, everything got worse. Any time I moved, my head would throb so bad that I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital.   3:45 pm:  the headache started to finally go away. It would only hurt if I moved fast. At this point my fever was only slightly high, about 99 degrees. I was still unstable when I walked and dizzy. I went from being super cold, to being super hot and sweaty. And I was alternating between cold &amp; hot and sweaty for the rest of the night. Was also having some memory issues, repeating things when I was having a conversation with someone over the phone.   I was sweating all night when I was sleeping.   Saturday 4/10: 7:00am: woke up with a slight headache; still out of it and dizzy.   8:00am: after being awake for about an hour or so, I looked in the mirror and my whole face (around the lips, cheeks, and jawline, and under the eyes) was really swollen and puffy. My face was even mis-colored. Under my eyes was purple and yellow, and my cheeks were white.   Some confusion persisted throughout the day as well as dizziness.

He has no history of allergic reactions to a vaccine, medication or food. There was no visible swelling or localized reactions to the injection site. I cleared the table next to him and had the patient lie flat on the floor with feet elevated for several minutes. He still continued to report feeling faint and stated ?I am about to pass out?. we called 911 to seek further medical assistance. I checked his blood pressure and it was 122/84. EMS arrived minutes later and patient started to stabilize. Patient asked to be transported to the hospital &amp; EMS took patient to the hospital for further evaluation.

I immediately grabbed another chair and raised his feet above his heart level. He immediately stated that he was &#34;feeling better&#34; and his vision was improving. I then offered him a cold bottle of water. He appeared very stable within a few minutes. We did call 911 as a precaution, they arrived a while later and deemed the patient was stable and their additional services were declined by the patient. I insisted the patient stay and finish the bottle of water. All together I believe the event was about 30 - 35 minutes before leaving. I encouraged the patient to drink plenty of fluids and electrolytes and to take it easy for the rest of the day.

Pt. came to profusely sweating, pale, and feeling dizzy.  We took his BP and kept monitoring it for 45 minutes after we had him lay down.  His BP continued to rise and was normal.  Pt. was nervous before vaccine administration (shaking).  After event, Pt. stated this has happened in the past with donating blood.  Pt.&#39;s girlfriend picked him up, so he did not drive home.

                                                In the span of about 40 minutes following the shot, I had severe reactions. I initially felt really warm in my arm and my heart started to race for a bit. That subsided pretty quickly. Then I got really dizzy, lightheaded and warm and sweaty while waiting the 15 minutes. Then my vision started to blur and I felt tingly in both of my hands and both of my legs. According to others with me, I also went grey. I was given a cool cloth and fanned which helped with a lot of the issues. I also had my legs elevated and was given some slightly sugary food and drink to help the vaccine disperse better. Paramadics and amabulance arrived to assess me. I was improving by the time they arrived and was deemed stable, so I did not go to the hospital for this incident

                                                One week after receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, several small bruises (6-8) appeared on the back of my left leg. Throughout the day, my leg developed a soreness that, after reading a 10 Feb 2021 story in the newspaper about COVID vaccine recipients developing immune thrombocytopenia caused me to seek medical treatment in the afternoon of 4/6/2020. I first visited an urgent care facility where my high blood pressure (130/98) combined with my slight lightheadedness, soreness in the leg and observes bruising were enough for the tending physician to recommend rushing to the ER for bloodwork to be performed immediately. I was admitted to the ER in the early evening with an elevated blood pressure (~150/111) and the bruising still prevalent. The tending nurse practitioner authorized a complete blood count (CBC) and discharged me an hour later when the results came back ?extremely close to normal,? noting that my platelet count of 194 was no immediate cause for concern. Since then, the bruising and soreness has subsided.

The symptoms included body aches, high fever, chills, nausea, hallucinations, dehydration, dizziness, loss of appetite,  exhaustion, and a restless night of sleep.

Wasn?t very noticeable and had some bad allergies that day so I chalked it up to that. About a week passes and it only slightly starts to get worse, and i can feel it in my feet as well. I was confused so I started asking about it around my work eventually it had started to affect my walking and it was clear something was wrong, I felt like I had lost balance in my legs and I was losing sense in my fingers. I stopped going to work and went to a doctor on 4/15.

Patient started to seize. I turned him to his side and tried to keep his mouth open in order for him to not bit his tongue. Meanwhile 911 was called. Patient had seized about 15-20 seconds, then suddenly he became calm and conscious. 911 dispatcher told us to keep him laid down on the floor till they get to the store. One of our coworker asked patient few questions to see if he remembered things. Paramedics came about 7 minutes later and took care of him. They let him go after evaluation. I called him later &amp; he had recovered.

                                                At approximately 8pm the day of the vaccination, I felt fatigued. I woke up the next morning feeling like I was definitely sick with the typical symptoms. I was resting all morning on the couch at the house I was dog sitting. At around 11:30am I took my daily Claritin and two ibuprofens. At around 12:15pm, I was getting my haircut and felt like I was going to pass out. I asked the hairstylist to grab water and something to cool me off. I didn&#39;t have much control of my body, ED was called, and paramedics showed up. About 5 minutes into the incident my arms and legs started tingling and felt like someone was trying to twist my skin. An IV was put into me and about 5 minutes later I snapped out of the episode.

                                                Last week Monday - June 14 I worked 1pm-9pm. My opening pharmacist left around I&#39;d say 2pm, or 2:15pm~ish and hadn&#39;t witnessed the incident. So somewhere around that approximate time I was inside the pharmacy working on a back computer by drive thru and I heard someone yell for help in the waiting area. It was the kind of help you just know means something really drastic has just occurred. I quickly entered the waiting area via the pharmacy consultation door and saw patient face down between two chairs and his nose had a consistent drip of blood that was apparent on the floor.   My technician who was in the consultation room told me he had received a Johnson and Johnson Covid vaccine probably within 5 minutes of the incident. With the combination of that information and the visualization of an active bleed, I made eye contact with another staff member inside the pharmacy at will call and told him to call 911 which he turned around immediately and did. The man was alone, but the woman who yelled for help was also calling 911 I believe. At this point I&#39;d say approximately every 3 seconds, a new drop of blood would emerge. There were a couple people nearby including the customer and I asked everyone to stay back a little, I surveyed the scene and it appeared to be safe and I approached patient as I tried to verbally get a response of some sort.  I asked if he could hear me, if he knew where he was and what happened, both with no response. The bystander recommended turning him on his side but with the unknown cause of the bleed and the recent vaccination I didn&#39;t know if it could be CNS or spinal related and since we were on the phone with EMS, we could get their recommendation of whether to move him or not.   Within 15-30 seconds probably, he started regaining consciousness and he was scared at first and rightfully so. He jolted up and back and looked at me like, &#34;why am I face down in my own blood (and probably in a lot of pain i&#39;m sure)&#34;, and it scared me a little to be honest. I told him what we had observed, and I saw the bridge of his nose stuck out beyond what was normal but I&#39;m not sure what normal is to him..?? I saw two small lacerations on the side of his nose and a pair of glasses on the floor. I couldn&#39;t determine if they were broken or not but surmised, he must have fainted and fallen off the chair and landed on his glasses which cut and may have even broken his nose. Or maybe the ground broke his nose. Either way it looked bad. There were several store team members around at this point (those listed in this report), and the patient was given paper towels for the bleeding and bottled water. There was a store use wheelchair we put him in when he was ready and wheeled him into the consultation room where he could be monitored until EMS arrived.  While speaking with the patient before EMS arrived, he rendered all the following information:           Never had a reaction to a vaccine before           Never had any knowledge of high or low BP issues           Doesn&#39;t recall ever feeling lightheaded or dizzy upon quickly erecting           Might have low blood sugar issues                   Reasonings for the above response:                             Hadn&#39;t eaten that day yet before his shot and was feeling a little anxious about it                            Last time he gave blood he hadn&#39;t eaten breakfast and passed out after that                                         This was the only other fainting history mentioned                                        He did say it was within the last 6 months  EMS arrived within another 2-3 minutes I&#39;d say at which time we had already began the cleaning process. We blocked off the area to other customers, we halted the vaccination process until the issue was resolved, I printed the Biohazard Spill procedures, we obtained the bio-hazard spill kit, and proceeded to clean with all the PPE and sanitization materials included within the kit. After the entire process was completed the store team even ran the cleaner over the area to go above and beyond.   The patient refused the ride to the hospital via ambulance due to costs and signed a medical waiver I believe..??

                                                Patient received the Jansen covid-19 vaccine today.   he was fine when he received the vaccine but when he was sitting in the chair in the pharmacy lobby he fainted.   I saw him fall out of chair and immediately ran out the door to assist him.  He fell out of chair face down on the floor.  When I reached him I rolled him over and spoke to him and he responded to me.  I had him remain on the floor for several minutes before I had him sit in the chair.  He bit his lip and there was a spot of blood and he hit his forehead on the floor.   We called emergency number and emergency medical team arrived shortly and took his vital signs and they were normal.   He was a little clammy and sweating a little.   I gave him a bottle of cold water to drink while he was sitting.   The emergency team checked him out and they ask him if he wanted to go to hospital and he declined going.   The emergency medical team left and I had him wait a while longer.   I had him call his mother to come and pick him up so he did not have to drive himself.  His mother arrived about 20 minutes later and I went over with her what had happened.  She took him home and I called to check on him after a few hours and he said he was doing fine.   He also stated while talking with him that he had never passed out when getting other vaccines or the flu shots previously.  He did state that he didn&#39;t like needles but was not afraid to get the vaccine.

                                                After his vaccination, patient was waiting 15 minutes in waiting room. Patient knocked on door and said he didn&#39;t feel well. I closed door and turned to grab epi-pen and diphenhydramine. When I turned back around, patient fell on the floor and was unresponsive. I asked my technician to call 911. Patient regained consciousness in about 10 seconds and I told him an ambulance was coming. I observed his breathing to be normal. He sat up against the wall in a cold sweat and told me this has happened to him one time when he donated blood. The ambulance and paramedic arrived very promptly. They took him to the ambulance.
