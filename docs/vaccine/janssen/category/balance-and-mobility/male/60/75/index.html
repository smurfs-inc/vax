                                                Immediately got hyper dehydrated. Then felt like I was going to passout soon. I ate a banana and drank pint of water. That helped   36 hours later my throught 1/2 of it, got very sore, like pins sticking inti it like a tonselitious maybe. Same time my mid/right side back started to hurt. Thought it might be gastral. Continious to this day and wordened up until today. Maybe Kidneys? or?? I was thinking again was gastral, but now I know it is not. Same pain when pressure put on it by bending, sitting in my truck against seats etc... Now I am worried. NEVEER had something like this other than a Gal Blagger which was removed.

                                                14 days after receiving the vaccine, I started getting dizzy/vertigo. When i lay down on my back,  or when i tilt my head back or when i  turn my head to the left and right. The room that I am in, starts to spin. I have to stop and stand still for several seconds before I am ok. I am 61 years old and never had any dizzines/vertigo in my life before I received the vaccine. I exercise 3 times week, dont smoke, drink very little alcohol consumption. I am 5 feet 9 inches tall and weigh 165 pounds. My blood pressure is 130/80. I have been going to a chiropractor about 2 times a month for the past 20 years for regular spinal adjustments. I am an active person with no health issues.  .

                                                The injection itself was high on my arm and was very painful as it was administered (much more so than a typical vaccination in the arm).  The pain has been persistent, and has gotten worse over time.  No fever, no inflammation at the injection site other than a red dot that resolved over about one week.  On advice of my physician (nurse practitioner) I&#39;ve been icing the shoulder three times a day and taking ibuprofen 800 mg q 6h - this has not led to any improvement - to the contrary the pain is getting worse and the shoulder is losing substantial mobility.    Something seems to have been done wrong - and am wondering if the injection itself was given in the shoulder or tendon rather than intramuscularly.

                                                On 04/12/21 I had just eaten and sat down at the computer. I started feeling disoriented, light headed and my vision started to become affected. I could not focus my vision and tried to vomit also also but immediately went to bed. Throughout the day/night when i got up I was unable to walk/see as normal and required my hand on the wall for balance. I also felt nauseated and could not eat anything during this time. I was able to sleep mostly and as of this submittal(04/13/21 7:51 pm CT) i have been symptom free for several hours. No medical treatment was sought due to no health insurance. All symptoms indicate stroke .

                                                Patient states he received J&amp;J vaccine on 4/1; on 4/10 he had nonradiating persistent low back pain. A few days after that (on 4/13) he felt numbness and pain in his legs, in addition to ?decreased sensation in his inner thighs. These sensations were migratory and intermittent. Also noted in his upper extremities as well. He also had issues with temperature sensation in his lower extremities. On 4/14 he had slight haziness in vision while driving which resolved after 30-60min and has not recurred. He also had slight difficulty walking. On 4/15 he had an appointment with his PMD; had L-spine XR which revealed moderate lower lumbar facet arthritis, and was thought that change in sensation was likely d/t radiculopathy - was prescribed ibuprofen, muscle relaxant, oxycodone (took oxy x1, ibuprofen for a few days). Since then he has also had intermittent stabbing pains in various parts of his body which resolved spontaneously. On 4/17-4/18 his back pain resolved. On 4/18 at 4:30am he woke up with R-sided facial weakness. He has not had focal weakness aside from the face.  Was seen in ED that morning for this R-sided facial droop involving the forehead, diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy and given prednisone/valacyclovir. Yesterday 4/19 around mid-day he started having L-sided facial weakness and slurred speech. This has progressed since yesterday. Reports ability to swallow, though a little difficult d/t cheek weakness. Low back pain has returned as well. Does report constipation and possible poor bladder emptying for the last few days.  He was seen by a Doctor and referred to ED to rule out AIDP and other diseases after J&amp;J vaccine.

The diagnosis was Unilateral Vestibular Hypofunction; it was the same side I got the shot on (left). I was treated with meclizine and given outpatient eye-hand exercises to do.

Received J&amp;J vaccine at 3 weeks ago. His current neurological examination and clinical history is suggestive of GBS  NEUROLOGICAL EXAM:  MSE: A&#43;Ox 3 Language: no aphasia   CRANIAL NERVES:  2nd CN: bilateral pupils are equal round and reaction to light, visual field-full 3rd,4th and 6th CN: EOM-I 5th CN: no sensory deficite 7th CN: face: symmetric, not able to smile or blowing air or holding water 8th CN: hearing loss: no 9, 10th CN: no dysarthria, palate movement:normal 11th CN: no neck weakness 12th CN: tongue: middle, no atrophy   MOTOR EXAM:  Tone: normal  Strength: 4&#43;/5 at bilateral UEs, 4 Pt symptoms started very early. Narrative from family below:  &#34;Day 1 (The day he took the vaccine): My father was complaining of very heavy chest pressure (said he felt like his chest was being pushed down with force.) He felt really tired and had a nasty headache.   Day 2 He began to feel tingles in his legs and arms. Said he felt sore and had mild pain around his back, feet, legs, hands, and arms. The headache came in and out.   Day 3 He began feeling more severe pains in both legs &#43; headache. More tingling around his face, lips, and jaw.  Day 4 Severe pain continued around his entire body. Had an episode where he lost vision from 1 eye (he described it as blurry vision) felt like he was going blind from one eye.  Day 5 Could barely stand on his two feet and could no longer go to work. He stayed in bed and then hospital visits began. My mom took him to emergency for the first time.  I was able to get details of the location where he was vaccinated and onsite contact information. The info is below:

I returned his call and he verbalized all issues above and also said his legs, arms and hands were cramping up and having ringing in the ears.  I recommended him to go to the ER now, he said he had called his PCP and was told the same thing.  He stated he is single and lives alone and does not drive.  I told him to call 911 and he verbalized he is too embarrassed to do that and states he will wait for his daughter to call him.  I offered to call his daughter for him and he declined.   Addendum: Created by RN. 04/16/2021 02:01 PM 04/16/2021 Client called reporting the same symptoms as in 4/13 message -- I told him to go to the ER immediately. He stated he could not drive due to muscle spasms and feet and leg pain. Asked if he would please call 911 and stated that was not necessary. He verbalized he understood my directions and stated he would go to urgent Care. Called Sheriff office to make a well person check.

When rolling over in bed from flat on my back to my left side my body felt like it kept  moving when I had in fact stopped. It feels like I am rolling out of a hammock. Right side has the same sensation. Also happens if I bend over when standing. It is not always accompanied with dizziness. Severity increased over a few days, then gradually decreased over the next 5 days or so and is now increasing again. I HAVE NEVER HAD THESE SYMPTOMS IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. My pre existing tinnitus has grown very much louder. I have had occasional low pain / pressure deep in my sinuses.

                                                10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient claimed he was feeling light headed and needed to lay down. After speaking, his eyes then went closed, and he clenched his fists and he started coughing up liquid. He was not responsive. He was moved to the ground and turned on his side. He became alert about 3 minutes after becoming unresponsive. He claimed this happens to him when he is at doctor&#39;s offices or receiving vaccines/procedures. He claimed it was &#34;normal.&#34; He said he felt fine/normal, and this has happened in the past, though he did not mention this to the pharmacist prior to administration. 911 was called and examined him. He was allowed to go home on his own, did not go to the hospital.

About an hour after the vaccination, I began to lose my mental function.  My brain/mind were not functioning properly - to the point that I could hardly remember my name, let alone do anything on the computer that I was attempting to do.  At about that same time, I had a feeling of near complete exhaustion come over me, to the point of thinking I might faint at any moment. I went to my bedroom and laid down.  I fell asleep shortly there after and woke up approx 2.5 hours later.  After waking, I felt normal again.  I was able to process my thoughts and did not feel faint or exhausted any more.  It has been 1 month today since having the shot.  I have not felt any additional adverse affects to this point, other than the several hours after the shot. On a side note, I had not been sick prior to the shot or in the several months leading up to the shot.  I have also not been sick since the shot.  It was only the several hours on the day of the shot.

When he pulled up his pant leg, he saw the small little red spots that were exquisitely tender. He went immediately to his primary care physician&#39;s office, where he was prescribed Bactrim for suspected cellulitis. The rash steadily worsened with extension up his left leg and onto his right leg and blistering of some of the lesions most markedly in his groin. Pain associated with the rash increased and remained most severe on the lateral aspect of the left ankle. He presented back to his primary care physician&#39;s office on 3/19, where he was given methylprednisolone 80 milligrams IV, discharged with a prescription for prednisone 60 milligrams daily for the next few days. Pain worsened the morning of 3/20/21 to the point that he was unable to bear much weight on the left leg prompting his presentation to the emergency department.

That never has happened before.  on 4/7/2021, at approximately 1:00 pm, I stood up, got light headed and blacked out for a few seconds.  I took my blood pressure and it was in the normal range.    I didn&#39;t think much of this until the recent reports on the Johnson and Johnson vaccine started circulating. I&#39;ve had no other issues.

                                                I felt dizzy and had problems with breathing right away after the injection. A doctor from that site who checked my vitals wanted to call an ambulance to take me to a hospital. I couldn&#39;t let this happen as I was 120 miles away from my apartment, where two dogs were left unattended. I decided to come back home and monitor my vital signs. Since that time, I had almost every other day a chest pain and high blood pressure and low level of O2 but was too busy at work to care of myself. On 04.30.2021 around 3am I decided to drive into ER at where I was admitted and had CABG surgery on Tuesday 05/04/2021.

                                                2 weeks  ago on April 17th,  I woke up feeling very dizzy and nauseous. The room was spinning. My left ear was ringing, My balance was off.  Every time I bent over it was worse. I vomited after I ate.  Spent the day and the next day in bed. On Monday I called my doctors office and explained how I was feeling  and a tele visit was scheduled later in the day. During the tele visit,  the doctor diagnosed my symptoms as vertigo. I never had vertigo in the past. She couldn&#39;t tell me if it was from the vaccine or not. She did mention she had patients complaining of vertigo after getting the covid vaccine. Medication and exercises were given to me.  A few days later, my big toe on my right foot was aching terribly.  Each day it seems to be worse and I am at the point where I can barely walk.  Today I did some research online and saw that it could be gout. I never had gout n the past. I read vaccines can cause gout.  So here I am 2 weeks since my symptoms began and I am still dizzy and have the toe pain. Exercises and medication is not helping.

Had a 101.5 degree temperature all night which went down to 100 in the morning and back up to 101.2 later on the 14th.  I had nausea and extreme pain all over my body and restlessness.  it got a little better the next day but still feels like I have the flu. I had covid back in march of 2020 and was tested for the antibodies at the end of August.  There is a horrific dearth of research on people who have had covid and whether they should get the vaccines. It is disgraceful, and the next time I will listen to my gut which told me NOT to get vaccinated!

About 10 days post vaccine, the symptoms returned with a ferocious energy.  The pain in my muscles and joints is so severe that I can&#39;t roll over in bed, have difficulty walking, and getting on and off the toilet. It interrupts my sleep so that I play musical bed-chair-couch throughout the night.  Needless to say, it exacerbates the level of pain and fatigue I&#39;m already experiencing.  It is life debilitating as I cannot participate in my usual daily activities of walking, hiking, gardening, biking, etc.  As a result of joint and muscle stiffness, I am also now experiencing headaches. These extreme conditions have persisted from March 23- April 9...and I don&#39;t see relief in the future.

Things have gotten progressively worse as I now cannot walk up a flight of stairs without a racing heart and heavy breathing and extreme exhaustion. (FYI, before this I was running 4-5 miles 4-5 times a week). In addition, my doctor tells me that I have no Covid-19 protection based on blood tests.

                                                The Headache/Pressure is there in the morning, and I feel fatigued, like I really didn&#39;t get any rest in the night.,  And  the headache/pressure stays with me all day., But I don&#39;t believe it wakes me in the night, I did developed blurry vision, but only in one eye (right)., I went to Eye doctor, and they said it appeared a cataract had developed since the last visit. but the blurry vision has somewhat improved with reduction of the blood pressure., as far a dizziness., I would not feel comfortable going out and flying a plane since the covid vaccine shot, so I&#39;d say I am a little unstable on my feet right now.....

Went to doctor and had Epley Maneuver performed a few days later.  Then on 23-March woke up at 4:15 AM with another BPPV event.  Again, returned to doctor for Epley Maneuver.  Then on 2-April went to ENT Doctor to have ears checked.  She performed the Epley Maneuver and everything was fine; there was no nystagmus. Then she laid me down on my back and tilted my head off the table and I had the worse dizziness ever, but no nystagmus.  She sat me up.  My BP jumped to 190/100; pulse 100.  I couldn&#39;t stop being dizzy. Paramedics took me to emergency room.   After 2 hours the doctor performed the Epley Maneuver, but there was no nystagmus so it wasn&#39;t BPPV.  Had CT scan and MRI and everything was clear.  What changed and what may have caused all this was that I had the J&amp;J vaccine prior to all the dizziness.

Over the next two days the left stayed the same while the right continued to worsen to include pain and tingling from the elbow to the hand particularly in the three central fingers. Hand difficulty holding item in my right hand. I then decided to seek medical attention the next day. The next morning swelling and pain were lessened so I did not contact medical attention.  Each day since symptoms have improved except for discomfort in my right middle finger which is noticeable upon touch. Most noticeable when using eating utensils. The right middle finger has remained the same for days.

                                                On Thursday, March 18, I had some slight dizziness during the day. After going to bed that night I woke up and the night light in the smoke alarm on the ceiling appeared to be spinning. I sat, then stood, grabbling walls for support and attempted to reach my recliner. At that point I was severely dizzy, completely lost any sense of balance and collapsed into the chair. I could not stand or walk. After 20 minutes, I asked my wife to call an ambulance. I did not think she would be able to get me into our car. The paramedics ran an EKG and tested me for a stroke. Both were normal. I was transported to the ER. The doctor gave me Meclizine. Had a CT scan of my brain, and blood work. All results normal. Dizziness resolved. They tested my balance and then released me at 3:30 a.m. on March 19. I was tired that day, but did not need further medication. During that night, as I turned over in bed, the vertigo returned. I took a Meclizine and went to the recliner for the remainder of the night. I am feeling somewhat fuzzy today, March 20. Not sure how long this will continue, or if it is related to my Covid vaccination. However, I am reporting it in the event that others may be experiencing this problem as well.

                                                3/22/21 Admission HPI: 71 y.o. male with a history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and COPD.  He presented to my office today acutely with a several day history of increasing shortness of breath.  He has increased his prednisone at home recently and been increasing the frequency of his DuoNebs.  Despite this, he states that his oxygen saturations have been staying in the low 80s.  He has a hard time walking due to the shortness of breath.  He states previous to about a week ago he was doing very well.  He denies any fever.  He denies any known exposure to coronavirus (COVID-19).  In the office today his oxygen saturations were 88% on 4 L. Because of his failure of outpatient therapy, he will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.  This patient has a history of severe respiratory decompensation that happens very quickly.  Therefore, it is medically urgent we get him into the hospital.     3/25/21 Admission HPI71 y.o. male with a known history of severe COPD and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  He came to my office with a several day history of increasing shortness of breath.  He had increased his oral steroids and breathing treatments at home and despite this was still having oxygen saturations in the low to mid 80s on 2-4 L of supplemental oxygen.  In my office he was extremely diminished and had basically failed outpatient therapy.  Therefore he was admitted to inpatient status for acute treatment of a severe COPD exacerbation requiring IV antibiotics and IV steroids.  He was admitted and treated with IV treatments.  He did recover nicely.  However, he was found to be extremely physically deconditioned.  Because of this he was thought to be an excellent candidate for swing bed and is being transitioned to swing bed.    4/5/21 ER Practitioner Note: Upon arrival to ED trauma room I found patient to be in cardiac arrest, CPR in progress. History is that EMS was called to the scene for a patient with chest pain.  Shortly after arrival at his home  patient developed a cardiac arrest.  They followed standard ACLS  protocol and the patient was intubated. Blood sugar normal. As CPR was given, medications were administered consisting of epinephrine and 1 mg in 2 different doses along with 1 amp of bicarb. IV access via an IO. Patient was then transported to the emergency department.  Upon arrival, CPR was continued and oxygen supplied via endotracheal tube with good tube placement verified by auscultation and good sat readings.  Monitor was placed and patient demonstrated initially a sinus rhythm but there was no pulse.  Therefore, diagnosis was PEA and no reversible causes were identified.  ACLS protocol was followed with epinephrine 1 mg IV every 5 min.  He received a total that including EMS, 5 mg of epinephrine and 1 amp of bicarb.  Monitor at this point revealed the rhythm changed to an agonal rhythm.  When CPR was given, there was good results from the CPR.  However, CPR discontinued and there is no pulse and patient had an agonal  rhythm for several minutes, pupils were fixed but not dilated year.  Lungs demonstrating clear bilateral breath sounds when he was bagged via the endotracheal tube.  No external signs of any trauma noted. The patient&#39;s sister is here and she is a registered nurse.  We had discussed management at this point with her and all were in agreement that the code be terminated.  At 1015, patient was pronounced deceased..    ACLS protocol was followed.  See nursing record for medication and vital sign details.   Code outcome: Deceased   CC time 20 minutes.

                                                My father received his shot on March 13, 2021.  He drove to move home and on March 28th started having his right arm go numb but did not tell us.  He asked to go the ER March 29th at 6:45am saying his chest hurt and was having a hard time breathing, this has happened before since having Covid in September.  I called 911 after he became dizzy and could not walk.  While at the ER suffered a massive stroke that paralyzed him from his nose down over a course of 3 days.  His brain stem was affected and he lost the ability to swallow.  After being on a ventilator for 72 hours he was removed from it and died less then 30 mins later from drowning in his own saliva on April 1, 2021.

                                                It started with a familiar reaction and that was I had tingling and pain in my feet it started with both feet and it was significant, like when the feet goes to sleep and it is coming back and you feel the pins and needles feeling, and it was exactly what I get with CIDP. It moved from both feet up to both hands and I was not really afraid because that is what happens with CIDP when your auto immune system is stimulated. I get numbness on my feet and in my hands. I thought that the vaccine stimulated my immune system. The CIDP has been in remission and maybe the shot has stimulated my nervous system.  The other day I noticed that when taking the hot plate from the microwave it was hot but I did not feel it at all. I thought the food has not heated up, when my wife touched the plate she said it was very hot and I did not feel the plate hot at all. I also felt pain in my left foot to a point that I am not ambulatory. The pain is so extreme in my left foot if I try to stand up. I have been in my bed for the last 2 days. I am not sure if it is the CIDP or GOUT that is attacking my foot but it has been triggered by the vaccine. I also have severe pain in my left leg. I called my cardiologist and I have a phone consultation with him today to check for clot formation. The pain has subsided a bit today, but yesterday the pain in my leg was very intense. I also had pain at the injection site and felt a little feverish since yesterday around 3PM and it went to 101F and this morning I am fine again. I did not take anything for it and this morning I woke up and I felt well (in regards to the fever). I did not have fever before then.
