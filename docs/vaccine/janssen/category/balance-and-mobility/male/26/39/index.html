Hearing came back after 5 minutes, but moderate body shakes began and lasted an hour. Got very cold feeling and began to feel fever like. Took acetaminophen and covered up with blankets and drank water. Took a couple hour nap and woke up sweating with terrible migraine and light body shakes. Fell asleep for a few more hours and woke up not feeling feverish, but migraine and body aches. 22 hours after onset I have a light headache and body aches and am mostly feeling recovered.

After awaking he doesn&#39;t remember the last 5 minutes. He laid down to go to sleep and was consistently hot and then cold. He does have a history of night terrors but they have remained dormant for about 2.5 years. Around 12 am he started having one of the worst night terrors I&#39;ve seen. The following morning, April 2nd 2021, he was feeling incredibly sore and the injection spot was tender. He said &#34;it feels like I got hit by a truck.&#34; Seems to be doing okay otherwise now.

                                                Only minor chills before bed, 11pm. Muscle aches, felt as tightness in IT bands, made remaining asleep difficult. Got up to use the bathroom around 5am. Upon finishing peeing while standing, I lost consciousness, falling. As a result of the fall, I fractured my cheek bone, cut open my ear, later requiring three stitches, and was concussed, resulting in a loss of memory. I was nonresponsive when my fiance found me immediately following the crash, and was rushed to the hospital  via ambulance. Upon arrival to the hospital, my fever was found to be 102 F. As a result of the fall, I have a cheek bone fracture, three stiches in my ear, and a concussion.

I went back and checked on him after 5mins of waiting, then came back to the pharmacy. But heard a big bang shortly after. Some how, he had fallen out of his chair and bumped his head and neck on an end camp. He seemed a little confused, when I ran over, but was awake, a little sweaty and nauseated. EMS was called. They transported him to ER to have his head checked, since he bumped it.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I received the Janssen vaccine in my upper-left arm at 3:00 PM on April 5, 2021, at a public health clinic (I think that&#39;s the proper term for the site) established in a mall. After about ten minutes, during the scheduled waiting period, I began to feel lightheaded; I can best compare the feeling to that of being tipsy after a glass or two of wine. I waited another twenty minutes at the site to see if the feeling worsened, and when it didn&#39;t, I left without telling anyone how I felt. During the drive home, however, I continued to feel lightheaded during the drive home and worried that it might be affecting my driving. After I got home without incident, the feeling persisted for a few hours and ceased that evening.  Since then, I have experienced nothing but what I think are standard post-vaccination symptoms (fatigue, muscle aches, slight brain fog, swollen lymph nodes?not unlike the sensations of recovering from a modest cold). I nevertheless want to report the lightheadedness because it appears (based on news reports) that it is an unusual reaction to the vaccine. I want to make sure that my experience is recorded, even though I do not believe that I require further medical attention.

About 5 minutes post-vaccine, the patient stated he was not feeling well and feeling warm and sweaty. The pharmacy staff provided the patient with water and an ice pack. The patient stated he was feeling faint. The patient fainted for about 20 seconds and then became conscious again. The patient didn&#39;t have any injuries and didn&#39;t fall down. The patient was okay and he laid down and elevated his feet on a chair. He then stated that he has severe needle phobia and has fainted several times in the past with vaccine administration and blood draws. He had experienced this in the past. He was still slightly faint and requested that he be checked out. The EMT arrived and they took his vitals and checked him. By the time the EMT arrived, he was beginning to feel better and had sat up and drinking water. There were no further issues. The EMT stated he was good to head home. We followed up with patient and the patient was feeling good with no further issues.

                                                I received the J&amp;J vaccine at 10:00am on March 18, 2021 at the Community Center. By about 5:00pm, I started to feel minor flu-like symptoms, but as the night progressed it got significantly worse. Around 8-9pm, I was bedridden with the worst chills/shaking I&#39;ve ever experienced in my life. Around 9:30-10:00pm, I was filling water at my sink and projectile vomitted multiple times into the sink and could not make it to the bathroom. Subsequently, I ate a bagel and drank lots of water, knowing my vomitting could make me dehydrated. Throughout the night, I was awake and shaking, and drank and filled my water bottle repeatedly. At 8:00am, I was filling my water, and without my knowledge of awareness, fainted on my kitchen floor, dropping the Brita filter and likely hitting my head. My roommate heard the commotion and saw me passed out in our kitchen. He tried to wake me up and I phased in, but then subsequently phased out again 20-30 seconds later as I was trying to stand and likely hit my head again. My roommate eventually got me over to our couch and called EMTs. Upon their arrival, EMTs checked my pulse, which was fine, and saw an open laceration on the back of my head, so they took me to Hospital to access the Trauma Center. On the way, I threw up repeatedly and was very lightheaded. Upon my arrival at Hospital, I was checked for any neck bone breaks, given an IV, a CT  scan, an EKG, and staples were placed in the back of my head to heal the laceration. After my release, I was bedridden for 2-3 days and required a daily nap during work (1-2) hours for the next 1 1/2 to 2 weeks. For a while, everything was fine, but recently during the first two weeks of April, it has become apparent that my head is foggy and reacts to changes in the weather, which leads me to believe that I likely banged my head pretty good when I fainted those two times.

                                                I asked the patient how he felt after the injection and he said that he felt a little lightheaded and nauseous.  He said he had a little too much to drink last night because his buddies were moving West.  I asked him to lay on the floor but he refused.  He said, &#34;I just want to sit for a while&#34;.  Within minutes the patient turned pale and started twitching. I asked another pharmacist to help to move him to the ground.  911 was called while patient was on the ground lying sideways because I was afraid that he may choke on his vomit.  In a few minutes, patient sat up and asked for a bucket to throw up in.  The Fire department came and took his blood pressure  (BP120/?) and asked him some questions. They his blood pressure was good and advised him not to drive home.  They helped him to get back on the chair. He stayed in the vaccination booth for us to keep an eye out until his friend showed up to take him home (30 minutes later). We had a male associate escort him out because he said he was still nauseous.

He drank some Gatorade and ate a couple of chocolate kisses.  He began to have cold sweats that lasted a few minutes.  I sat with him in counseling room for 15 minutes and then he sat in waiting room  until he felt better.  He did not feel that he needed further attention or medical assistance.

I quickly grabbed an ice pack and placed it behind his neck to keep him awake. He started leaning forward and told me he is loosing his vision. He leaned forward and I had to support his chest with my arm all the while trying to talk to him. He dropped his phone and wallet on the floor. He seemed to be loosing conciousness. I had an epinephrine 0.3 mg in my hand but because he was speaking I did not inject him. After about 20 seconds he started gaining his vision back but he said his vision is still fuzzy. After about 2 minutes he felt better so I asked him to position himself at the blood pressure machine. It was 86/65. He does not take any medications or has any health issues. After 10 minutes he took blood pressure again and it was around 129/91. He used the restaurant during the 10 m inute break.

Patient was feeling good to go home. I did follow up with him about an hour later. He did make it home and was feeling better.

                                                Woke up at 12:00am today with headache, lots of discomfort (especially in stomach), and for the most part could only fall back asleep for short intervals while being awake most of the night.   At around 2:30am, could barely walk into the front room. Just very slowly and painfully. Ended up in such a state that I absentmindedly urinated onnthe bathroom floor while pulling pant leg up to scratch an itch while urinating in toilet. Laying on back caused butt and thighs to hurt significantly more. Same for stomach. Getting up from and laying down on my floor mattress was and still is difficult.   Later into the morning at around 6:40am, had to crawl slowly on hands and knees to get back in the front room. By around 8am, I could walk around without it being unbearable. Just slow-ish. Ate breakfast, so stomach is more uncomfortable than in pain. Can lay on it without too much problem, but butt is still hurting. Stretching legs forward caused some pain.  Possible fever.

                                                Around 6 pm the same day I received the J&amp;J shot I started to feel chilly and a little nausea. I went for a walk for about 40 mins started to feel worse. I had body aches throughout my back and chest and in both arms, was freezing. Tried to eat dinner but couldn?t, too much pain and increased nausea. Tried to lay down, but began having a fast heartbeat and fast/some difficulty breathing. The pain in my chest was the worst pain I?ve ever felt. Continued feeling horrible with a fever of 100.7, nausea, headache pains throughout chest back and arms, freezing, and my arms and legs felt like they were becoming numb. Could not stand, very dizzy, tried to sleep through it. I threw up around 11 and did so a couple more times after that. Was finally able to sleep and woke up feeling much better. Arm is still sore at the injection point.

                                                I gave the vaccine around 6:20pm after counseling on possible adverse reactions and going over the patient&#39;s questions. I then asked them to wait 15min. Within 5-10mins the patient got up and came back to our counter saying he thinks he&#39;s having a reaction. I pulled him back into our vaccination area and had him sit down and explain what he was feeling to me. He looked pale and told me he felt dizzy, sweaty, shaky, &amp; nauseous. He wanted me to grab him a bag incase he puked. I grabbed a bag as well as water and Benadryl. I asked if he was having any issues breathing or if it felt like his tongue was swollen at all. He said no issues breathing and tongue felt fine.  He started to feel better within about 10-15 minutes after onset. He did not puke and his color returned. I had him wait an additional 10-15 minutes after that to make sure we were recovered. I asked him if there was anything else going on and he mentioned that he hadn&#39;t slept well the night before and that he had barely eaten today. He also mentioned he can get anxiety. I told him all of those factors could certainly contribute to what he just experienced but that I would be reporting this on to be safe.

I sat him down immediately, he was having trouble staying awake eyes glossing over, speech very slow. I turned to push the door open into the main pharmacy to call for help and have them dial 911, grabbed epinephrine and ammonia salts as well. When I turned back he had slumped in his chair. As I took the step back towards him, he spontaneously started to sit up and speak. Was diaphoretic, still slow speech eyes glossy. I supported him as best I could. His HR was 42, i lifted his legs up unto to a chair in quazi trandelenburg position. He stated that made him feel alot better. I stayed with him until EMTS arrived. He got himself onto they stretcher and they took him out of the store.

                                                Muscle aches in armpits began a few hours after receiving the dose.  Within 8 hours of dose, a mild fever and chills began (around 100 degrees F). I attempted to take a bath to soothe aches but it did not help, and instead tried to go to sleep at 8:30 pm. A slight red rash appeared on chest and arms around this time.  I was woken up at 10:30 pm feeling disoriented and hot, with a fever of 104.5 degrees F. My wife noticed slurring of words and that I seemed unstable and confused, and symptoms were severe enough we considered going to the emergency room.  I experienced ringing in my ears and a severe headache.  I took 2 extra strength Tylenol, put a cold cloth on forehead, and drank fluids to fall back asleep.  Fever dropped to around 102 but continued throughout the night.  I woke up at 6:30 am and took two more Tylenol.  The severe headache continued and I vomited twice.  I attempted to take a shower and rinse off, and continue to rest.  Fever is reduced to 99 degrees F with help of Tylenol.

At 6:35, he said he had left arm weakness (arm he received vaccine in), fatigue, was dizzy, and felt &#34;off&#34;.  Patient did not lose consciousness and refused an ice pack.  BP checked at 6:38pm (170/98, pulse 105).  Patient stated his blood pressure usually runs high. I offered him an ice pack a second time, but he said there was no need and he felt better.  BP checked again 6:52pm (152/101, pulse 99).  I recommended that since his blood pressure is usually this high, he should follow up with his primary doctor regarding blood pressure as he may need some medication to assist in lowering it.  He said ok.  He left the pharmacy area at 7:02pm and said he was fine to leave, he did not want to remain any longer.

No signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis were identified so the patient was observed and monitored.  The patient then became unconscious for approximately 10-15 seconds with small jerking movements identified during this time. 911 was called and the patient was monitored until EMS arrived.  Epinephrine was prepared and ready during this whole time but was not administered because the patient didn&#39;t show symptoms of anaphylaxis (trouble breathing or talking, trouble swallowing, hives, flushing etc).  The  time from vaccine administration to EMS arrival was approximately 20-25 minutes.   The patient was able to talk and communicate clearly the entire time except during the brief unconscious period.

                                                After getting vaccine and during the 15 minute wait, he became light-headed and started sweating profusely. He became pale and lips were white. Helped to lie down on matt, with feet in chair, and cool cloth applied to neck. Blood pressure was 100/64 and pulse was 64. After about 2 minutes, he said he felt better than when he first came in. I asked him if he had ever had this happen before and he said yes when he had blood drawn a few years ago. He was helped to sit up in a chair. He no longer had any light-headedness and his color was returning to normal. His lips were now pink. He was given a granola bar and water to drink. After staying for 20 minutes longer he left. He was called the next day by me and he said he had not had any light-headedness after he left.

I shook him and said his name while my coworker called 911.A retired nurse assisted me . As patient was coming  to he tried to stand up and appeared to be convulsing, so we sat him back in the chair. He then wasa responsive but sweating profusely.  We got him to the floor andput cold compresses on forehead and neck and waited for 911 to arrive.  They released him to his girlfriend to bring him home.

                                                At 6:00 PM 3/12 I began to feel slightly dizzy. It did not effect my ability to stand or move around very much, but my head did feel strange and if I turned to quickly I would need a second to gather myself. However, it was not severe enough to force me to sit or lay down. By 7:00-7:30 I began to feel hot and uncomfortable and I took my temperature at 7:30 and I was running a low grade fever at 99.8 degrees F. I began to feel very fatigued and was in bed by 9:00 PM. I woke up feeling fine and my temperature at 7:00 AM 3/13 is 97.8 degrees F. My only possible side effect this morning (3/12 as I write this) is that I am mildly stiff, mostly in my left arm, neck, and back (the side of the injection site). Despite the mild fever I did not feel any nausea, nor did I have difficulty breathing. Overall the side effects were mild but uncomfortable.

The fourth and fifth day my lips and face would become tingly/numb and my left arm would get weak and I would feel a little disoriented, my sleep has been pretty disturbed. It felt like I was having a stroke. I did not have a stroke,  I continue to occasionally feel the above symptoms, a little less potent than they were, they might be going away, I can&#39;t tell. I will be calling my doctor if it continues.

About 10 minutes later I was notified someone wasn&#39;t doing well. I went to the patient and he was hunched down and looked pale and he stated he was very dizzy. I asked him if he had trouble breathing and he stated he had not. He appeared like he was about to pass out, I was asking him questions about his state and he wasn&#39;t being coherent. I told him I was going to give an EpiPen and call 911. I gave him the EpiPen in his outer thigh. EMS came 5 minutes later.  A few hours later I got a call from a close by asking if I had given him a Benadryl because he was feeling drowsy. I asked his status and the nurse stated he was doing fine.

My normal is 62-75 bpm. While I was sleeping, my heart rate ranged from 93-113 bpm (according to Apple Watch). Extreme headache Inability to sleep Chills and shakes Extreme fatigue Light headed and unable to speak clearly  I don?t know if this was life threatening; I know it was likely my immune system responding but these side effects were extreme. I almost called an ambulance. I?ve never felt pain like that before in my head. My heart felt like it was racing all night and my brain felt like it was going to expand out of my skull. The head pain, heart rate, and rapid breathing was keeping me up.  I tried to sleep 7pm?12am which was the worst of it. By the middle of the night, it seemed that the fever subsided and my resting heart rate was more in the 90-100 range (still 15-30% high).   The next day, I have a moderate headache that feels like after pain from the night before. Fever subsided. Heart rate is slightly high at 80-100 bpm. I managed to sleep in the whole morning.  I had to take off from work today in order to rest.

To this day (one month later) by ability to recall memories and recall words remains poor. I have troubles forming sentences because words don&#39;t come to me. To this day I cannot recall anything that happened days 1-3 after the vaccine. I was able to write this report because my partner made me take notes on how I felt. Prior to the vaccine I never had an issue with memory recall. My physical reactions cleared during the second week after the vaccine. However, the mental reactions still stubbornly persist.

She yelled for help. I immediately joined patient and wife. He was already conscious and aware of surroundings, alert to time and place. I retrieved mat for him to lie down on. He stated he was feeling better. After about 15 minutes the patient was feeling back to normal and was upright in a chair. He remained there for another 15 minutes at which time he felt well and comfortable returning  home with wife.

                                                Patient was looking pale a minute after the shot, I asked how he was doing, he responded by saying he felt very dizzy. I asked him to take slow deep breaths, gave him some water. About after 1 more minute he passed out (very unresponsive but still breathing, pupils very dilated) pulse was slow but still palpable. Tried ammonium smelling salts, that did not bring patient around. Called 911. Tried patting patient and talking to patient to bring them back to consciousness. After about a minute or two patient was able to respond to me. He knew his name and date of birth and where he was. Asked him to wait for ambulance to check vitals. Patient said he still felt very dizzy. Kept his head down and eyes closed. Once EMS arrived they checked his vitals, determined BP was low (they did not tell me a number). They monitored patient&#39;s vitals for 10-15 minutes. BP did not &#34;bounce back&#34; per EMS so they took him to the hospital for IV drip possibly.

Currently (6 days after vaccine) I have feeling of pressure in head above left ear. Pressure accompanied by slight headache, dizziness, feeling flush, stomach pain, and tingling in right hand.   These symptoms haven&#39;t changed over last 4 days, and most pronounced is head pressure, dizziness, and general disorientation.   Haven&#39;t taken medication, just getting good rest and hydration, but symptoms aren&#39;t lessening.

The patient was sitting down, so I approached to see if it was an allergic reaction or not. I checked for breathing and had another patient call 911.  Patient woke back up while we had the 911 operator on the phone.  He asked for some water and he felt light headed.

At day 7 I started to feel sharp, cramps, tingly sensation and numbness in different parts of my legs, arms feet and hands. I also had headaches and felt dizzy. Headaches went away by day 15, but the pain, tingly sensation and fatigue in my arms and legs still remain (tomorrow it?s going to be a month since I got my shot). It gets significantly worse when I walk and I feel very fatigued after walking for about 30 minutes.  The pin has also appeared less frequently on other parts of my body, like my heart, my neck and around my rib area. Over the last two weeks my legs have also been getting itchy.

I went over to observe and gave patient some water.  He was starting to sweat and turned very pale.  1 minute later he passed out.  I brought him to the floor from his chair and he  starting shaking and &#39;seizing&#34; for about 10-15 seconds.  We used pressure on his chest to try to &#34;snap&#34; him out of it.  After about 15 seconds of &#34;seizing,not breathing normally and his left arm completely locked up&#34; he came to and did not know where he was for about 2-3 minutes.  After about that time he started to realize where he was and recognized his wife who was assisting.  EMS was called and arrived shortly,  He was lucid and knew where he was and started to feel normal again.  EMS checked his vitals and they were normal.  Patient refused to go to hospital and EMS released him to his wife.  I checked on patient 4 hours later and he had no ill effects and stated he felt just like he did before receiving the vaccination.

                                                Patient received vaccine and reported approximately 5 minutes later that he needed help. Within just a few seconds following him calling for help he was not able to talk and his eyes had rolled into the back of his head. His body was rigid but he did not lose consciousness. A technician called 911.  He was sweating profusely so his jacket was removed and a cold rag applied to his head. He finally came to after approximately 1-2 minutes and reported that he was feeling very dizzy. His blood pressure was 118/80 and temperature was 98.5 degrees Fahrenheit. He was examined by an EMT, and they found a very similar blood pressure.  Patient reported feeling much better and was fine to go home. Treatment occurred over a 15 minute window.

                                                After receiving the Janssen Covid 19 vaccine, I proceeded to the waiting area and was instructed to wait 15 minutes before leaving the facility. Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the injection, I started to feel faint, lightheaded, nausea, and clammy. I informed a member of the staff and several medical personnel came to assist. They laid me down on a cot and checked my vitals. I started to feel better after laying down. The staff took my blood pressure and heart rate readings, which were relatively normal. But after sitting me up and taking my vitals again, my blood pressure and heart rate spiked. I was taken to Hospital in an ambulance; however, after waiting in the ER waiting room for about 2.5 hours, I left without seeing a doctor. During those 2.5 hours my original symptoms did not return, so I elected to leave.

He said that he was texting on his phone and the next thing he knew, he was on the ground with people around him asking if he was ok. He stated that he was very sweaty, nauseous, and a little dizzy. We called a code white, provided the pt with a cold compress and elevated his feet. Pt did not want us to call 911. Pt did not have PCP and has not been to a doctor in about 5 years. He said he was very nervous getting the shot and is afraid of needles so that may have contributed. Pt stayed in the pharmacy area for about 45 minutes until he started to feel better and his mom came to get him. I tried calling pt again at 7:10pm to check in, but there was no answer and I could not leave a voicemail due to mailbox being full.

                                                Joints began feeling achy and body felt tired within a few hours of vaccination. About 10 hours later body began to feel warm and then within an hour began uncontrollable shivers and aching in testicles followed shortly after by a throbbing headache and pain behind eyeballs. I put on extra clothing and jumped into bed as symptoms persisted. Later in the night I began sweating profusely and removed the clothing. The headache and pain behind the eyes persisted. I also began feeling nauseous and almost vomited when I went to the bathroom. My body was so tired and achy I could barely move. I tried to wake up for work but my headache and pain behind the eyes was so bad I went back to bed for another four hours. I did not have any appetite for the rest of the day.  My headache subsided that afternoon and I went for a walk that night and my body still felt incredibly tired and achy. The pain behind my eyes persisted. The following day I felt somewhat better and could work. That night I went for a jog and my body felt extremely heavy, my joints ached, and I could not catch my breath. My symptoms continued to improve but I have had no sex drive for a week.

                                                I had received the Janessen vaccine around 3:30pm. Around 1 am I woke up to shivering and chills. My head felt extremely pressurized inside. My eyes felt like they were being pushed out of their sockets. My body hurt. It hurt to move. My neck , knees, ankles and back were in shooting dull pain. It took everything I had to stand up. I couldn&#39;t get to sleep. I had a fever. I started to shiver. My thought raced. It began to hurt to breath. My lower chest is sore on the inside where the lungs meets the rib cage.   I could not to go class or do any work. Was easily one of the worst nights of my life.

He recovered in less than a minute and felt good after it. We took care of him. We observed him for more than 30 minutes. He felt really well after that minute.

                                                I developed extreme body aches and chills along with an extreme fever, and it progressed throughout the night until I was delirious. I fainted once trying to take medication (ibeprofen) in the bathroom. I never measured the fever because I was delirious and could hardly move due to pain. I have never felt so sick in my life and I am a healthy 30 year old with no other health issues. I am feeling better this morning but have lingering symptoms of chills and aches. I am reporting this because the intensity of the reaction seemed overwhelmingly extreme and scary for someone of my health and age.

Patient became alert and oriented as well as stopped the bleeding before paramedics arrived. After being assessed by the paramedics, he requested not to go to the hospital and to leave on his own. I requested the patient sit for another 15 minutes before leaving to which he obliged and thanked me before leaving.

In few seconds, he started convulsing. I administer Epi-pen 0.3 mg, 1 adult dose in his left thigh. His convulsion stopped at very moment, paramedics took over from there. His vitals were checked and monitored by paramedics for few minutes. He did not require hospitalization at this moment, however advise to seek medical attention if he feels something abnormal. He was able to walk himself to his car, where his family member drove him to home.

                                                I received the vaccine on Wednesday, April 7th.  I was told I had an anaphylactic reaction at the time of injection: I started sweating upon receiving the vaccine, my blood pressure dropped, and I almost passed out. I was monitored for 30 mins before being sent home. Other than some fatigue, I was fine the rest of the day.  On Thursday, April 8th, I was tired but felt fine otherwise.  Friday and Saturday, April 9th and 10th, I felt like I was back to normal and even did some light exercise.  On Sunday morning, April 10th, the left side of my body (side of injection) went numb, I had extreme vertigo, shortness of breath, and blotches that appeared in random places. It didn&#39;t look like hives, but rather looked like strips of red. I didn&#39;t feel like I was having an allergic reaction, but something did not feel right. I consider myself a pretty healthy guy with a healthy lifestyle. I did not feel the need to go to the ER quite yet, but I did have a friend come over to monitor me.  My friend did some acupuncture which helped resolve the numbness and dizziness and some of the blotches, and also mentioned concerns regarding blood circulation and potential clotting issues she thought I was having.

                                                Immediately after injection: pain and soreness around injection site.  Starting about 3-4 hours later: impaired coordination.  The next morning: severe dehydration, disorientation, loss of balance, very low energy, headache, body aches, inability to remain standing or sitting, difficulty walking, fever, feeling hot and cold, sweating and shivering intermittently and sometimes both at the same time, impaired mental focus, worsened pain and soreness around the injection site, nightmares. Slept the majority of the day, rising only to eat and drink lots of water.  Symptoms abated throughout the day. By about 7pm, I was able to sit up enough to play some video games.  The second morning: most symptoms gone or almost unnoticeable.  Hot/cold flashes, impaired coordination and low energy continue, but improving. Attempted to go out for my usual 2-mile jog after work, but only made it about one block walking before becoming both too cold and too tired to continue.  The third day, afternoon: completed my usual 2-mile route, at a walk, with frequent stops to rest.  No noticeable symptoms from the 4th day after injection, onwards.

                                                I woke up in a very heavy sweat and got up to use the bathroom. I felt unsteady. After washing my hands, I turned to the towel and vaguely remember falling to the floor. When I came to, I was too weak to get up. I laid there for 5 minutes before struggling to sit. After some time I was able to weakly return to bed and drank some rehydration tablets. My best guess was I had been drinking water but not replenishing my electrolytes.

                                                Seizure - I have never had a seizure before and there is no history of epilepsy in my family. I had the Janssen vaccine shot at around 5PM on Thursday and felt mostly fine on Friday. I had typical shot symptoms (tired and soreness near injection sight). On Friday night around 10:00, I was standing talking to one of my friends in the living room when I had a blackout seizure without any warning. The seizure only lasted about 30-45 seconds, and then I became conscious again. It took me about 5-10 minutes to become completely aware and able to stand up. I have never had a seizure before and have not had one since then.  Later the following week, I did have a couple of hours where I felt extremely dizzy and lightheaded, but it went away without another seizure. This is also not typical for me.

Pharmacist rushed to help him up and he complained of feeling very hot and sweating profusely. He did not have any swelling/itching of throat/facial area. Patient was provided cold water, and told to remain seated. Pt was asked questions such as name, what day it is, to establish if patient was alert and oriented. Patient complained of experiencing tunnel vision while passing out. He proceeded to pass out once more, while seated, this time the pharmacist was able to support him in his chair.  After the water and rest, patient said he felt much better and his girlfriend came to escort him home. He stayed for about 30 minutes before leaving and staff made sure he was feeling alright.

I asked him if he would like some water and he accepted. He returned to the chair in front of the pharmacy and sipped on the water. He looked like he was pale and breathing more slowly. I went out front to check on him and his breathing appeared labored, he was sweating profusely and he said he felt lightheaded and his hands were tingling. I told him to relax and take some breaths. His hands were very shaky and I took him BP (94/61 and HR 54). At this point I had my technician call 911.  Between the time the paramedics arrived he went unresponsive for approx 20-30 seconds. I yelled his name and slapped his leg. No response. I checked for a pulse and if he was breathing. He did have a pulse and was breathing. After coming to the paramedics arrived and took him to the hospital for evalution.

                                                He was doing fine when I escorted him to the waiting area. Upon a few minutes later, he started to fell down. I was called and came to check on him. He told me he closed his eyes for a bit and started to fall down. I was not sure if the fall was because he lost balance or the shot made him fainted. There was no respiratory distress or any anaphylactic reaction so no Epipen was use. I applied cold pack to him and he recovered a few minutes later.

Pt was encouraged to focus on breathing but began to complain of muscle tightness in the hands and back. at approximately 7:25 EMS arrived and were able to calm patient using breathing exercises.

The patient denied ambulatory care to the hospital for further evaluation.

                                                I got vaccinated on Friday. That night, I had chills and a headache, but this went away by Sunday morning.  On Monday, I woke up and I was too dizzy to walk. The initial dizziness subsided but I&#39;m still having balance issues as of Wednesday night. A doctor prescribed meclizine which didn&#39;t help.

A couple of minutes later he said he was feeling light-headed. We had him stay seated in the chair and I went and got the BP machine. I had the technician taking notes. Checked BP and it was 67/35 pulse 75. I advised him that we will have him lie down and elevate his feet to help increase his BP but he declined and stated that this usually happens with needles. I checked his BP again and it was 79/28 pulse 71. We gave him a bottle of water and very shortly after he expressed he was feeling much better. At no point did the patient have trouble breathing or was experiencing any symptoms of allergic reaction/anaphylaxis. I had patient stay seating for another 10 minutes and checked his BP one last time and it had come up to 110/77 pulse 79 and he expressed he was feeling back to normal.

                                                At 23:15 (7 hours after the dose) I started to get cold while under my blankets trying to sleep. My teeth began chattering as I started to shiver. I got up out of bed to put on a sweater. With each step I took towards the sweater my body started to fully shiver and contract. After about 4 or 5 steps I could no longer move and I fell over. I started having full body spasms and full contractions. I felt like I pulled every muscle in my body trying to relax and fight the contractions. It felt like I was being tasered for about 10-15 minutes. Once I had the strength to grab my sweater I slipped it on. As my body warmed up these contraction subsided.  By 01:00 (9 hours after dose) my body temperature had spiked. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer to check my temperature but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I spiked a fever. I placed a wet cloth on the back of my neck, forehead and chest to cool down.   At 06:00 (14 hours after dose) I took a cold shower to further drop my body&#39;s temperature. It felt like a full body sun burn where you just radiate heat. I was hot everywhere.  At 08:00 (16 hours after dose) I took three (3) 500mg ibuprofen to help fight a nagging headache. I did not have much appetite for food. I regularly eat breakfast in the morning (bowl of cereal).   From 09:00 to 12:00 (17-20 hours after dose) I felt groggy. Did not seem or act like myself. Was very tired from the lack of sleep the night prior. Seemed very fatigued.  Around 13:00 (21 hours after dose) I took a 45-60 minute nap. Woke up feeling much better. I would say most / if not all symptoms subsided after 22-24 hours.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the injection, I became dizzy and lightheaded. My  eyesight became blurry and my hearing very &#34;tinny&#34;. I felt nausea and  thought I was going to throw up. I sat down in a chair and was given a granola bar and some water. After about 3 or 4 minutes the majority of these  seemed to fade, but I still felt slightly &#34;off&#34;. Approximately 9pm that evening I felt very fatigued, so I went to bed. At approximately midnight, I woke up shivering, extremely cold, and sweating. Around 2am I had a fever of 102.3. I took some Tylenol to try to bring my fever down, which seemed to help. Around 9am the next morning my fever was gone, though I still felt extremely fatigued.  Later that evening, after several naps, I started to feel a little better. Most of these adverse events were resolved by 28 hours after injection. I had arm soreness at the injection sight that felt like having been punched in the arm for about a week after the injection.

                                                Approximately 2 minutes after the patient received the vaccine, the patient had other questions and while talking about the vaccine, the patient&#39;s eyes rolled back and he experienced a vasovagal reaction (syncope). Although he was sitting in a chair, his head fell to the left and his forehead bumped the table. The patient&#39;s legs were elevated and his upper body was laid back. Ammonia inhalant was crushed and immediately placed under the patient&#39;s nose. The patient came back to consciousness approximately 30 seconds after passing out. Patient was asked what symptoms he felt leading up to passing out. He said that he suddenly felt dizzy and does not remember much after. Patient states that he did not eat breakfast prior to receiving the vaccine and has a history of not doing well with needles or vaccines. He states that he now feels completely fine, however, the patient was advised to stay 30 minutes for monitoring, and once he felt comfortable standing up, a nurse walked with him to the observation area. Patient was provided an ice pack for his forehead. Observation nurse was notified of the adverse event and is now monitoring the patient.

Medics arrived within 10 minutes to evaluate the patient, offered to take them to the hospital, patient declined and they released them to take it easy and call them/go to hospital if they felt faint again.

Around 5 hours after injection I was overcome with extreme lethargy and had to sleep. 8 hours after injection I woke up very nauseous and could not stop salivating, however I never puked. I woke up again 18 hours after injection and felt nauseous and my chronic back pain had returned. I also had a weird throbbing pain in the right side of my neck and in the lower left side of my left leg. All symptoms were gone by ~36 hours after the injection.

I know Covid is serious and I did the vaccine to protect others, but at my age I think Covid symptoms would have been easier to deal with. The extreme, and I am saying extreme, symptoms lasted for roughly 24 hours. They started 24 hours after the vaccine. I  am significantly better now (8:24 am 6 minutes from the 48hr mark).

                                                Approximately 8 hours after injection I began experiencing extreme fatigue. This was soon followed by uncontrollable shaking and chills. As this progressed I began to experience extreme aching pains all over my body, a headache, and dizziness. I fell asleep somewhere around 11pm or 2 hours after on set of symptoms. I awoke multiple times in the night to body aches and a head splitting migraine. During the night the chills and shaking turned into a fever and sweating. At 6am the next day I forced myself to take some painkillers and hydrate. The body aches had started to recede at that point but the migraine was extremely painful and It was nearly impossible to open my eyes with a hypersensitivity to light. I slept on-and-off through the next morning and nearly all symptoms stopped by 1pm on May 8 or 24 hours after the injection.

                                                Roughly three hours after getting the shot I was very cold and developed a fever of 102.8. I vomited that night. I took an ibuprofen to help reduce the fever then slept. For the next six days I had an on again and off again low grade fever and was nauseas most of the time. Sometime during those 6 days I developed intermitted tingling in my left hand, primarily by index finger. This continues to today happening roughly once a day.  On rare occasion my right had will do the same thing but that is far less often. I never had tingling in either hand prior to my vaccine. I also developed heartburn occurring roughly 1-2 times a day. Prior to the vaccine I rarely (1-2 times a year) had heartburn and I have not changed anything about my diet or lifestyle since my vaccine. Occasionally my head feels &#34;foggy&#34; as well and this began sometime after the vaccine but I can&#39;t recall exactly when it started. It&#39;s not a headache, more of a slight lightheaded, dull feeling. I had none of these symptoms with any regularity until I was administered the vaccine.

The symptoms progressed to feeling week and having a chill by 10:00 PM.  I woke several time during the night feeling hot and uncomfortable.  By the time I woke up at 6:30 AM the following morning those symptoms had gone.  I had a bad headache in the morning and took acetaminophen which helped alleviate the headache.  I have felt a bit weak and tired through the day.

The patient had a cut on his life from falling. He was given water, and the paramedics came within 5 minutes. The patient was able to walk out of the store with the paramedic team.

I got up to go to the bathroom and upon finishing, I felt my heart rate skyrocket and felt faint. I immediately went back to the bed where I lost consciousness. My wife said my eyes were open and my body was rigid. I came too within a minute of that and was breathing heavy and sweating and very fatigued. My wife had called 911 as I was coming back to consciousness. The EMTs checked my vitals and all was normal. They asked if I wanted to go to the hospital, and I said no. My back was extremely sore all day, and I developed small red spots around my eyes. I went to my doctor later that day and told them about it. They took my blood for tests, which I have not heard back about, and they did not conclude anything, but did set me up with an appointment for an MRI of my head, given my past history.

Attempted to wake leg up, lost equilibrium, stumbled, lost hearing, couldn&#39;t put words together to tell wife what was going on and ended up on the floor to regain composure.  Had difficulty putting on clothes to go to hospital.  Went to ER, had severe diarrhea there, they did blood work and EKG, sent me home saying maybe I feinted.  Had high blood pressure at ER, 150/86.  Felt weak and &#39;off&#39; sense the event, felt tightness in chest and odd limb pain past 72 hours.  Woke up at 3:30am on 4/15 with left arm asleep, went back to bed fine.  Never had these symptoms before.

For about 30 minutes I saw a white spot on the peripheral  view of my left eye.  By Monday, I felt dizzy and bottom right part of my chest hurt when taking deep breaths. The dizziness and chest pain lasted all week, still feel feel it today 4-18. My doctors office told me vertigo was a common side effect. On Thursday 4-15 every time I bent down and tried to get up, my right leg hurt as if I had exercised. At the moment I haven?t gone into work since Monday 4/12 since my job requires a lot of physical work.  I have mostly been home  resting  but don?t feel ready to go back to work. If someone  calls can it be a Spanish speaking person please.

Approximately 7 minutes later pt asked for water. Pharmacist brought water to pt and asked if he was feeling okay. Pt stated he was having trouble hearing the rph. Rph walked back to pharmacy and continued to observe patient. approx 2 min later, pt passed out from seated position. rph did not see fall. both technician and rph ran out to pt. pt face down and water bottle spilled. assistant store manager reported as well. pt came to immediately and sat up on floor. He attempted to stand to sit in chair, but rph asked him to remain on floor. rph went to get emergency kit while tech observed patient. rph came back with instant ice pack. First pack did not activate but second pack did and had patient hold to his head as there was a visible red spot. Patient continued to be observed and was texting on phone during observation. Patient came up to pharmacist at 6:15 to ask to leave and Rph asked if pharmacy representative to could walk him to his car. Patient denied and Rph asked him to wait additional 5 minutes for observation. After 5 minutes, patient left. Today I called patient. He said he is feeling better and still has mild pain and a headache today.

I had a temperature of 99.5 but immediately came down. In the early morning (the next day since receiving the vaccine), I felt nauseous followed by a headache. I also felt dizzy, but that immediately subsided. All of the mentioned side effects have subsided. My arm has been sore since receiving the vaccine but the pain has relatively minimized over time.

Felt basically normal by the time I left the facility and my arm has not been hurting since.   Approx 8:00 PM onset of headache, progressively worsening thru ~11:00 PM and plateauing. Headache was less by ~8:00 AM, and took Ibuprophin at 9:00 AM to further alleviate.   Approx 9:30-10:00 PM onset of chills and shivering, progressively worsening thru ~11:30 PM. Chills lasted through the night, but shivering stopped around 12:00 AM after turning the heat up and putting on more clothing, beanie, and blankets.   Fatigue is ongoing (as of now, ~22.5 hours after administration), but may be a result of poor sleep due to the chills overnight.

                                                Shortly after receiving vaccine, patient complained of fatigue and dizziness.  Blood pressure was measured as 156/97 mmHg and pulse was 69 bpm.  Patient stated he doesn&#39;t normally have high blood pressure.  Patient also started sweat.  Patient then declined any further treatment and was sent home with a ride (patient&#39;s mother-in-law).

                                                Patient received vaccine around 3PM CST and proceeded to waiting area for the recommended waiting time. Within a few minutes of receiving the vaccination, around 3:05PM CST, patient complained of feeling dizzy. Patient was carefully laid down on the floor, given a pillow to protect his head, and feet were elevated. Patient was extremely sweaty and lightheaded/dizzy. Patient maintained consciousness and expressed that he was beginning to feel a bit better once he was lying down. He was provided a cold bottle of water if needed. Patient refused dispatching an ambulance, which I believed to be an acceptable option as he was already improving and never lost consciousness. A blood pressure cuff was obtained and his blood pressure was 138/94 pulse 69 at approximately 3:15PM EST. He did not know what his BP typically is, but I felt comfortable that he wouldn&#39;t likely pass out with this BP. He wanted to set up due to feeling better, so we cautiously helped him do so. After having him remain seated on the ground out of caution, he requested to stand up. He stated he was feeling much better and expressed at that point he wanted to leave. His girlfriend was with him and would be driving him home. It seemed that his symptoms had fully resolved by the time he left the waiting area and assured me he felt okay.

                                                After vaccination, patient appeared to be slouched over in chair in observation area.  Two bystanders approached him and held him to prevent him from falling from his chair. Patient was diaphoretic and eyes half-closed. Attempt was made to arouse patient by talking to him and rubbing chest. His head and body moved erratically for approx. 3 seconds.  Patient was lowered to the floor. Nurse continued speaking to patient and rubbing his chest.  He then opened his eyes and was startled. Patient abruptly sat up and said, ?what happened and where is my phone?? The nurse reassured him he was being taken care of and she asked if he knew where he was?  Patient replied, ?I have no idea.?  A paramedic approached and asked the patient if he knew his name.  The patient correctly replied. The patient had no recollection of what had taken place, but did know where he was. Patient was then evaluated by the paramedics.  All tests performed were normal and patient refused to be transported to hospital.  Patient was driven home by his wife.  Follow up phone call to patient yesterday evening with no answer.  Follow up phone call to wife (listed as emergency contact), 4/7 at approx. 6 pm.  Per wife, patient experiencing fatigue and still very pale. She said he just wasn?t himself. Patient was concerned that they did not know what to expect a week or two from now.   I advised patient that if she had concerns, she needed to have patient evaluated in ER.

My D-dimmer test was normal. I noticed when bending down my headaches became worse. On 04-20-2021, an MRI of the brain was performed. On 05-01-2021, I experienced muscle body aches, fever and continued with headaches. I went to a walk-in clinic, where a Covid-19 test was performed and it was negative. I started taking antibiotics and the fever and muscle bode aches started to go away. I still have to this day headaches and an air-filled pressure sensation around my eyes and eyebrows.  As of today, my headaches are consistent, and they come and go.

                                                Patient was advised to remain in observation area for 30 minutes due to history of breathing difficulty with sulfa antibiotics in past. Shortly after being vaccinated the patient presented to our service window stating he did not feel well and was immediately escorted by the pharmacist to our administration area to have a seat. He stated he felt light headed, flushed (though not visibly), felt like his heart was racing, and was not having diffuculty breathing but felt like he couldn&#39;t catch his breath and stated he thought he was having a panic attack. He had stated before vaccination that he had not had a vaccine since his routing childhood schedule, his whole family had already had doses, and he had been putting it off because he was nervous. He insisted he needed some fresh air several times and was escorted outside by the pharmacist (with emergency supplies and a cell phone and within shouting distance of the pharmacy) for continued obsevation and was given water when requested. After a few minutes he stated he felt much better and the symptoms had resoved. He was directly observed outside per his request for the remainder of his waiting period and had no further symptoms. He was instructed to call the pharmacy right away if he had any additional symptoms after leaving.

                                                Patient felt light-headed, then became unresponsive. He moved both arms halfway up, and they both quivered simultaneously. I called for help. One nurse raised his legs &amp; another put a pulse oximeter on patient &amp; took his BP. Patient started responding to verbal cues. A nurse gave him Gatorade to start drinking. He was drenched in sweat from head to feet. The nurse continued to take his BP, which did hit 120/~70, but then dipped again. Once his BP &amp; pulse stabilized, he was able to go home. Patient ate a full meal &amp; a non-diet soda. He reported being exhausted ~4 pm. He fell asleep &amp; rose once to urinate.  Dr. at a Family Medicine practice checked his heart and lungs, and confirmed this did not appear to be an allergic reaction, but more likely was a vagovasal reaction. Patient started reacting ~10 minutes after the injection.

                                                I received vaccine about 4:00 PM. I felt fine until I went to bed about 10:30 P.M. I got extremely teeth chattering cold and could not get warm and began to have a small headache. I awoke about 2:30 A.M. and was extremely hot. I went downstairs to bathroom and the next thing I know my wife is shaking me to wake me up laying on the floor. My wife said she heard me fall and discovered me in the bathroom floor. She woke me up and I stood up and exited the bathroom and collapsed in the hallway. My wife awoke me again and I didn&#39;t know what occurred. My wife called 911 and EMS responded and assessed my condition. I explained everything that occurred and that I had my J&amp;J vaccine hours earlier.  My vitals were taken and my condition was evaluated. I had a bad headache that felt like my head was in a vise and my knees and chins hurting a bit from the fall I was fine. I just did not recall collapsing either time and I was distraught when my wife woke me both times. That&#39;s what I was informed by my wife. I don&#39;t recall anything after urinating to being woken up by my wife and I was on laying on the hallway floor and my wife was on the phone with 911.

Patient started to feel light headed and nauseous while walking to his car.  About 20 minutes following vaccination, a vaccinator had walked passed his vehicle and noted that he was unconscious.  Patient was still unconscious upon medical response team arrival and unresponsive to stimuli.  Once the patient awoke about 30 seconds later, he continued to state that he was nauseated and ?did not feel good.?  Patient was unaware that he had lost consciousness.  He further disclosed that he had been working in the sun planting trees all day and had not consumed any food or beverage.  He denied allergies to medication, food, and other vaccines.  He relayed that he had passed out from vaccinations in the past as a child.  He affirms lightheadedness and nausea.  He denies chest pain, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face/lips/tongue/throat, skin rash/itching, cramping abdominal pain, and vomiting.

He passed out and while he was out/when he was regaining consciousness, he started having seizure like movement. EMS was called and were here within 5 minutes. The paramedics took his vitals which were all WNL. Approximately 15  minutes later, the patient had a repeat episode. The paramedics and I suggested that the patient go to the emergency room via ambulance. He declined and left with his wife. They both reported that he would seek care at the emergency room.

He got back up on his own and was directed to sit back in the chair.  Pt was given apple juice to drink as he said he had not eaten that morning.  His blood pressure was measured and found to be within normal limits.  Pt was asked to stay for another 15 minutes for observation which he did.  He stated he was feeling much better at that time.   I asked him to stay a few minutes more but he elected to leave a that time.  I called the patient later on that afternoon around 3pm at which time he stated he was feeling fine and didn&#39;t require any medical treatment.

By March 30th my heart start beating out of my chest and I felt like I was having a heart attack.  I could barely breath.  Went to get something to eat, walked half way and felt like I would fall on the ground, and returned to my room.  Called my parents because I wasn&#39;t sure if I would wake up the next morning. My team leader gave me a ride to the emergency room. They drew my blood and it was dark and thick.  They sent me home.  Still feel fatigue.

                                                The patient experienced dizziness, lightheadedness a few minutes after receiving the vaccine, he also complained of sweating and chills. I gave him some water to drink and mountain dew, and I had him lay on his back for several minutes. The patient said he felt better and more alert after laying on the floor. After 10 minutes, I had him sit back up, he was feeling much improved. After 10 more minutes, he wanted to get a snack before he left. I requested he come back after the snack just to check in on him after he had walked around. The patient left the pharmacy feeling normal again.

                                                A patient received his vaccine and went over to sit in the waiting area.  A few minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient called me over to let me know he was feeling dizzy and felt like he was going to pass out.  I was able to have him lay on the floor and elevate his feet.  He was visibly sweating.  I got him an ice pack and put it on his forehead.  He never ended up losing conciousness and felt better after laying down for 5 min or so.  He eventually sat back up and stayed in the waiting area for a while longer to be monitored.  He eventually felt fine and went home.

                                                Pt. requested and received the J&amp;J / Jansen COVID 19 vaccination yesterday at 1317.  While he was being monitored for any adverse reactions, Pt. asked if lightheadedness was a side effect of the shot.  Writer advised that it could be and that everyone is different.  Writer asked if he would like some water, and he declined. Pt. was advised to remove his mask so he could breathe better.  Writer took his pulse while I gathered information.  It was 96.  Pt. reported that he did eat lunch, is drinking plenty of water and fluids.  He relayed he is keeping food down and not having any other issues. Pt. is currently on opiate withdrawal protocol.  Writer asked about his breathing and his chest.  Pt. relayed he was not having difficulty breathing and denied any chest pain at all.  Writer spoke with the Deputy to be sure that we kept an eye on him for a bit longer after his 15 minutes while he was in his cell, due to his lightheadedness.  Pt. was talking with writer, answering questions with ease.  Pt. was not diaphoretic and did have good color.  His pulse was checked again, and it was 84. At 1333, when his 15-minute observation was done, writer went to assist pt. to his feet and informed him that I would escort him back to his cell because he was still feeling a bit uneasy.  When he stood, pt.&#39;s knees buckled, and he knelt to the ground.  Writer helped pt. to lay down.  It was a smooth transition, and he had no injuries to his head or body.  Pt. had what appeared to be a short spell where his body completely tensed for a few seconds, then he relaxed.  He was having a hard time keeping his eyes open, but when prompted, was able to open his eyes.  The Deputy standing by was asked to call for the Public Health Nurses, who had moved on to the next POD to continue vaccinating.  Once on the scene, pt.&#39;s blood pressure was obtained.  142/80.  His pulse was 82.  During this time, it appeared that the tensing episodes became more frequent and a bit more severe.  They were happening approximately every 30 seconds, and lasting between 5 and 10 seconds.  EMS was activated at approximately 1340.  Pt. was awake during these episodes, and communicated with the nurses attending to him. While attending to pt. and waiting for EMS, it was at that time that pt. admitted that this was not the first time this had happened.  He admitted that about a week ago, the same thing happened.  When that new information was explored, pt. reported that his wife thought he had &#34;Serotonin Syndrome&#34;.  Writer asked what meds he was taking on the outside and he reported that he only takes methadone form the clinic.  He denied any other medications or street drug usage.  He does not take any mental health medications at our facility. Collectively, the nurses that attended to him after this episode agreed that this is an isolated incident and not related to receiving the COVID vaccine.  EMS arrived at approximately 1347, and report was given.  He was transported to the hospital for evaluation. Pt. was returned from the hospital at approximately 1600.  The Officer that accompanied him reported to facility that the hospital also believed this was an isolated incident, most likely related to withdrawals.  They did not believe that receiving the vaccine was a factor in today&#39;s events.  Labs were drawn at the hospital, and were all WNL.   Once back in custody, writer spoke briefly with pt..  He was feeling much better, and was sent back to his cell without further incident.

                                                Patient came in for Janssen COVID vaccine that was scheduled electronically online.  All appropriate prescreening was done and patient had no previous allergies or issues.  Patient was instructed to sit in one of the chairs designated for post vaccine observation.  Within minutes (less than 3), patient was very dizzy, clammy (cold sweats), pale and said he did not feel right.  I assisted him to a sitting position on the floor from his chair and we were able to ease him back to a lying down position from there with his head on the floor and feet elevated above heart on a chair.  Patient said that the cold floor actually made him feel better instantly.  At 4:18pm after lying down for about 3 minutes we checked his blood pressure with him still lying down.  It was 110/88 and pulse of 104 (so slightly elevated pulse).  He said he was feeling better and we kept him lying down.  Patient&#39;s wife was also there so she was able to provide information in addition to him doing it also.  She did state that he occasionally had panic attacks and she thought this might be one, the patient was adamant that it was not.  At 4:24 pm we checked his blood pressure again and it was 100/90 and Pulse of 104.  He was feeling quite a bit better so we had him come to a sitting position on the floor and he had not eaten in a while so we got him a granola bar and water.  Pt slowly ate these and begin to feel clammy and sweaty again within 3-4 minutes. We checked his blood pressure again and it was 104/90 and pulse of 100.  He wanted to stay sitting to see if it would pass.  We did continuously observe injection site and screen for any other symptoms of an allergic reaction (nausea, cramping, swelling, and none of these were occurring). Since he was still not feeling well we gave the patient 50mg of benadryl (20 mls of 12.5mg/5ml liquid benadryl) with his approval. After about 10 minutes of sitting total he was still having cold sweats and feeling dizzy so we had him lie back on his back with his feet elevated while the benadryl kicked in.  By 4:50pm he was feeling well enough to sit back up and we got him some wraps and a coke from the cafe to eat.  Pt continued to consistently improve and was ready to leave about 5:20pm.  We advised him and his wife of signs and symptoms of allergic reaction and to have those treated to immediately at urgent care or and ER.   We also told him to follow-up with his PCP.  I had a manager help walk them to their car.  They were very kind and grateful.  I will follow-up with a call tomorrow and again on Friday to make sure he continues to do well.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received my dose at 3pm on March 12, and experienced no adverse events until about 5 or 6 hours later. Between 8pm and 9pm, I felt a bit tired, though wasn?t sure it was vaccine-related at first. However, I shortly afterwards started feeling much more tired, and experienced chills and shivering. I went to sleep. My wife later said I felt very warm, though we did not measure my temperature.  During the night, at one point, I got up to go to the bathroom, and became very dizzy and nearly fell over, though I was able to catch myself and did not experience any fall or injury.   I went back to bed. At some other point during the night, I started sweating. My wife later said I felt cold at that point.  For most of the following day, Saturday, March 13, I no longer felt dizzy nor overly hot or cold, but had a migraine and mild nausea. I did not vomit, but I also ate very little during the day. I did eat a little in the morning, and had some water throughout the day. For the most part, I laid in bed, drifting in and out of sleep.   At about 7pm on March 13, I took two Tylenol to try to fight the headache. By 8pm I felt almost completely better. I ate more bits of food, and have felt fine since then. Sunday, I woke up and felt back to normal. I ate normally as well.

HR 70, BP 110/60, RR 18  We gave him some wet paper towels for his head and asked  him to focus on his breathing. We kept him in the observation area for a total of 45 minutes.  He still wasn&#39;t feeling great when he left, but he said he wanted to go home and lie down. He only threw up the one time, but he did have some dry heaving once more after his vitals were taken.

                                                Got the vaccine around 10:30am, felt ok until around 7:30pm, when I started feeling some nausea and dizziness and weakness. Then progressed to severe shaking chills, fevers, headaches, tingling/electric shock feeling in back of head/neck, muscle aches, mild joint pain, eye discomfort associated with the headaches, poor appetite at first, trouble sleeping, and fatigue; all of which required doses of Tylenol and ibuprofen and cold packs. Symptoms lasted all night and fever broke overnight after finally falling asleep. The next day (3/17) took some more Tylenol and ibuprofen, but the fever and chills subsided. The other symptoms mostly resolved except was still quite tired and felt weak. Also, had cold sweats all day on 3/17. By around 3/18 most all of the symptoms resolved.  Also, had mild soreness at vaccination site throughout.  I?m a physician. If I wasn?t a physician I may have sought medical attention.

                                                patient got his vaccine, put his shirt back on and buttoned it up and asked if it should be sore already.  I told him, yes the shot may cause some discomfort after injection and he was standing at this point.  He was about to say something and he fell backwards and hit a mobile laptop cart and the wall.  The patient went unconscious not talking but breathing was given an epipen and 911 called vaccine given a few minutes before 12:30 and 911 called at 12:29.  He regained consciousness fairly quickly and was assessed by the pharmacist and then EMT and transported to the hospital for monitoring.

                                                The night of the 9th, I had injection site pain. That lasted for three days, at least. Significant pain but it didn&#39;t stop  me from work. It wasn&#39;t consistent pain - I was having trouble getting my arm up. Thursday, - 18th - I suddenly felt tired and feverish. I did a PCR test on the evening of the 18th. Then there was fever between 98.9 - 100.4. I had cough and sore throat and I had runny nose. The fever kind of subsided after I took Tylenol on the 18th and then again 19th and 20th, as well. My COVID result was negative. I made an emergency report on the 19th with my doctor. I had a virtual appt with her. She was under the opinion that it was a bacterial infection or allergic reaction. When I took - Levocedrizine - my runny nose symptoms got a little better. On 19th, she prescribed me Erythromycin - I took the full course. of that and my fever left the Sunday after I started that. I finished the full course of it by Tuesday. I still had a cough but I did not have any other symptoms after the course of medication (five days- I took two the first day and then one of the next four days after that) was finished. Note: I use CPAP at night. My cough took some time to subside - it probably subsided by the 26th.

My blood pressure went up to 210/138 which is extremely abnormal for me. I began to tremor uncontrollably. I thought it was an anxiety attack so I took my Xanax. .50mg. That did not work at all. I experienced nausea and stomach pain. I called 911 and was taken to the hospital where after 4 hours I started feeling better. Tuesday I continued to have tremors. Wednesday the rapid heart rate, stomach pain, and nausea returned. The rest of the week did not get any better. On Saturday 3/27 I slept all day long which again is not normal for me at all. At this point we are 1 full week into the vaccine administration. On Sunday 3/28 I bagan to have the same feeling as the prior Tuesday. Sweating, couldn&#39;t breath, heart rate hit 170 this time. BP was the same, tremors, stomach pain, nausea, dizzyness, and this time my Carbon Dioxide level dropped to 24. This morning 3/29 I woke up with extreme tremors. No dizzyness.

Woke up the next day with a migraine headache, feeling very woozy and running a fever.  Had to call off work to recover from flu-like symptoms.

                                                Approximately ten minutes after receiving the vaccination I got very dizzy and passed out. I was out for 3-4 minutes and came to. Subsequent to passing out I vomited a few times and could not hold anything down. I also urinated on myself at some point when out. I was not getting better so 911 was called and I was transported to the emergency room via ambulance. Once the ambulance arrived at the hospital I vomited again filling about half of the vomit bag. I arrived at the hospital and an IV was not able to be administered so I was given Zofran for nausea and Gatorade to try and hold down. I spent approximately 4 hours in the ER, was able to finally get to the point where the nausea calmed down and I was able to walk around. I was then discharged.

                                                While sitting down during the post-vaccination period, patient asked his wife for water about 10 minutes after receiving vaccine. Pharmacy staff provided water and pharmacist went over to check on the patient. Patient expressed feeling &#34;hot&#34; and wanted an ice-pack, which was given. Patient expressed feeling &#34;faint,&#34; after which he briefly lost consciousness. Pharmacist immediately started checking for pulse and obtained Emergency Kit. Patient regained consciousness quickly without need of CPR or administration of Emergency Kit medications. At some point patient also released his bladder,  most likely during the syncope episode. Patient expressing feeling &#34;nauseous&#34; and asked for something to throw up in. Pharmacist quickly got a trash can and gave to patient, shortly after which patient started vomiting. Pharmacist was attending to patient and asked patient if he wanted 911 to be called, to which he replied &#34;No&#34; and that he just needed some time to sit. Patient also stated he did not eat much that day. Pharmacist offered Pedialyte, to which patient agreed, in order to replenish fluids/electrolytes lost due to vomiting. Patient also asked for some crackers since he did not eat much earlier. After taking sips of Pedialyte and taking bites of crackers, patient could not hold anything down and continued to vomit. At that time patient&#39;s wife asked pharmacy staff to proceed with calling 911. 911 was called and paramedics took patient&#39;s vitals upon arrival at the scene. Vitals were all stated to be normal. Patient agreed to be taken by ambulance to the hospital. A couple hours later patient&#39;s wife informed pharmacy staff that patient was doing much better and was expected to be released from hospital soon. Before receiving vaccination, patient did share that in the past he had &#34;felt faint&#34; when giving blood but it was not made clear that patient had felt faint or fainted during vaccinations prior. After the incident patient&#39;s wife confirmed that patient had fainted in the past both after giving blood and after receiving vaccinations. Pharmacist called patient at 9:12 AM the following day (4/3/21) to see how patient was doing but was only able to leave a voicemail message.

I felt nauseous and thought I would vomit, but didn&#39;t and believe I lost consciousness again. I was able to make it to the sink to try to wash my hands, and I fell down on my knees.

On the night of 4/7/2021 he began to develop hives/rash, and itchiness around the neck and legs. Next morning 4/8/2021 rash had worsened and pt had also developed swelling in the face and wrists. Pt was brought to urgent care where he was treated with prednisone. Pt was prescribed 20mg prednisone tablet twice a day. Charge nurse from day of vaccine followed up with patient, he will continue to take prednisone as prescribed and will follow up with allergist. Pt claims the itchiness is less, as well as, the swelling. Appreciates the follow-up phone-call and claims to feel better, will update us if any changes.

Of note, patient states he had not had anything to eat all day and only had some coffee. Paramedics onsite took vitals which were, BP 98/60, Pulse 50 bpm, O2 100%. Patient noted that he was an active runner, but stats were not typical. Paramedics noted that patient was ?very pale? and was still light headed 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine. After consultation with paramedics and patient, it was agreed to transport because of low vitals and no change in status. Patient was transported to local hospital and because of transport protocols, an IV of 90% NaCL was started.

                                                Within approximately five minutes of injection, I experienced increased sweating, light headedness, and difficulty seeing  until I passed out unconscious for a minute or two.  When I awoke I was still sweating and cold for the next five to ten minutes.  Paramedics checked my vital signs onsite afterwards (blood pressure, sugar levels, and pulse) and everything appeared to be normal.  I was able to drive home 30 minutes later after making sure that all side effects subsided.  I have not experienced any other side effects from the vaccine.

He said it continued to spread after his ER visit. I reviewed with him there isn&#39;t a treatment option and it should clear on its own, but if it still continues to spread or spots get bigger, if he develops a fever, increased heart rate, or pulse changes to contact his doctor or go back to the ER and followup with us as well.

                                                Hi I was vaccinated Thursday April 8th 2021 at approximately 9:15am. I kept a log so I could share my experience with my friends and family. After vaccination I was fine for a few hours but I randomly got a case of  watery eyes that would last about 15 minutes and then clear up. This happened 4 times over a 9 hour period. Around 9 hours after vaccination I started to feel like I had a cold and my skin all over my body ached to touch and my heart started racing. I felt sunburned and nauseous and went to bed. 13 hours exactly after vaccination I was hit hard with intense chills to the point of teeth chattering and full body shivering. 15 hours after injection I woke up intensely hot and I had a massive headache, full body pain, a tickle deep in my lungs that made me cough, nausea, and a fever of 101. I also was having extreme heart palpitations. I have a laser thermometer and I discovered my fever was 101.5 at my forehead but my neck and chest were 103. I took ibuprofen and kept patting myself with cold wet wash cloths to combat the fever. At this point I debated going to the hospital. I had intense fatigue and I was too weak to move but too sick to sleep. This level of fever and symptoms went on for about a day and a half. Since my vaccination I am still fatigued, I get winded very easily, something small like feeding my dog makes me break out in a sweat, and I need to lay down. I am still weak and fatigued but not to the same level as before and it changes every day. I have a sore throat, headaches, occasionally my body will twitch in random places, fever will pop up and go away, I cough gag and get very weak under any physical stress. I did not have injection site pain out of the ordinary until 48 hours after injection and it felt like a shotgun blast to the arm.. I did have very unusual joint pain from the start. I was injected in my upper left arm, but my lower right ankle was painful and my left wrist...    I am a 38 year old male with treated hypertension, obesity and sleep apnea. My mother who is 65 was vaccinated at the same time as myself and her symptoms were slow onset and much milder than mine but she too has headaches, upset stomach, fatigue, watery eyes, fever, chills, twitches, injection pain, etc.

EMS was contacted to assess patient and whether it was safe for him to leave pharmacy. EPS monitored blood pressure and other vitals and patient said he felt well enough to leave on his own after 30 minutes observation by rph

                                                After receiving the vaccine, about 12:30am on 03/28/21 I felt a chills, shaky muscles around my neck/shoulders..the room temperature was at 80F but I felt cold like 35F. The next morning, I felt very tired walking up stairs from the basement to my room on the 2nd floor..barely made it to the 2nd floor, felt like my body hitting a wall/ no energy to lift my legs up. I made to my bedroom but felt very dizzy, using my hands holding myself up on my desk and realized I might faint any seconds..my vision was bright and blurry. I slowly moved myself to a bed and laid down for a while. Later that day in the late afternoon, my muscles were sore (legs, thighs, back) I could not walk more than 10-15 steps which I needed rest. These conditions lasted me for 6 days since receiving the vaccine and felt better on the 7th day. Currently I&#39;m ok.

On Sat, May 1, I had an afib episode in the morning. Reset to sinus rhythm the next morning around 2:30am. I spoke with you during the episode.   3. On Mon, May 3, I had brain fog. I?m usually tired after an afib episode. But this seemed different. I?ve never experienced something like this before. But I chalked it out to the after effects of the afib and moved on. 4. On Fri, May 7, I started having the stiffness in my right calf. I checked in with you that weekend to make sure it wasn?t a clot. After we spoke I think we ruled out a clot.  5. In addition, I?ve developed some added symptoms since then: (i) Sweaty feet. (ii) Pins and needles sensation in feet.  (iii) Tightness in the arch of the right foot. (iv) Feet and hands feel sensitive to cold.  (v) Burning sensation in feet and left hand.  (vi) Mild headache mostly felt in the left temple.  (vii) A pulling feeling on the left side of the face. (viii) A feeling that if I close my eyes, I may faint.

Went away after 24 hours. The second began with profound feelings of mania 2 days later (Monday, March 8). This subsided in 24 hours. 4 days later- (Wednesday March 10) I began having difficulty standing upright.  This steadily became worse over the next several days until one week after the vaccination, where I was hugging walls and crawling on the floor to move from place to place.   This continued until Monday, March 15, when I was hospitalized.  Everything cleared up after 3 days in the hospital.

At around 2am April 11 I went to use the bathroom and blacked out. My wife found me on the floor and was able to rouse me. Went to the ER with severe stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea, severe headache, fever, high pulse of 120-140bpm. Pulse dropped to 108bpm by the time i got to te hospital. Hospital administered Zofran for my gastro issues and ran an EKG. We waited 3&#43; hours and never saw a doctor and was never even taken back in the ER. We left due to staff and patients in the waiting room not wearing respirators or masks or even basic sanitary precautions or separation of patients with Covid symptoms from other patients.

                                                Within a few minutes of receiving the vaccination I lost consciousness. It was a drive-through vaccination clinic by the Health department. My vehicle rolled into a cement and metal bar/side of the building&#39;s exit at a slow speed. The EMS at the scene stated that my heartbeat was irregular, varying between bradycardia and tachycardia. When they checked my blood pressure inside the ambulance they stated it was very low. About 15-20 minutes later I tried to sit up and was still unstable and unable to keep myself upright without assistance. I was then taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital&#39;s emergency department. Nothing notable or unusual was found when I was checked out there. Within a couple hours I felt well enough to go home. Once home I had a headache, fatigue, mild dizziness, and nausea with physical activity. The following day I had a headache, muscle aches, pain at the injection site, and nausea with extended physical activity. Today I have pain in the arm where I received the vaccine and a mild headache.

Thursday night/Friday morning I had the most prolonged fever break I&#39;ve ever had; my entire bed was soaked.  Fever was gone by Friday sunrise.

                                                Day two  after getting the vaccine, I started feeling vertigo and nauseous. I hydrated extensively, and  day three are started to feel a little bit better.  Day four I took a turn for the worse, and the vertigo and nausea intensified.   In the middle of the night, the vertigo was extreme.  I almost checked myself into the ER, but I decided to try to continue sleeping and hopefully feel better in the morning. In the morning, day five, I went to my primary care doctor.  I told her my symptoms, she said possibly due to the vaccine.  She prescribed me meclizine.  I took it in the evening, and did not feel any symptom relief.  In the middle of the night, extreme vertigo again, it was atrocious.   Day six (Saturday), I checked myself into the ER.  They upped my dose of meclizine (to 50 mg).  This new dose also had zero effect on my vertigo/nausea.  I felt vertigo/nausea all day. Speaking to some doctors in the family, they suggested to me that I had developed BPPV. Day seven, woke up again with vertigo/nausea, and it didn?t subside at all as the day went on.  I spoke with my father, and he told me that he had BPPV before apparently.  He drove to my house and did the Eply maneuver on me 10 times throughout the day.  Felt a little bit better.  Scheduled an appt with ENT for following day. Day eight, feeling a little bit better (after eply maneuvers, possibly related).  Visited ENT, he reassured me that the vestibular system is very efficient and I will eventually get better.  Scheduled appt for me for neurologist and MRI for later that day.  Went to see neuro, did MRI.   Day nine, feeling even more a little bit better. Day ten, which is today, feeling even more a little bit better.  Saw neurologist for follow-up, he told me MRI turned out fine, everything looks good with brain.  Just stay very hydrated and relax, I should get better in a week.  I really went through hell, it was atrocious.  My doctors said could be vaccine-related, impossible to prove one way or the other.  I figured I?d report it, just in case there might be others in the country who went through the same thing.
