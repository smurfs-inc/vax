                                                Patient received Janssen Vaccine  around 11:30 am. Patient was told to wait around 15 minutes to make sure everything was ok. Patient got my attention a few minutes later saying she felt dizzy. As i was guiding her back to the chair she passed out and i guided her to the floor. In a few minutes she was able to sit upright in the chair. EMS was called and she later went to hospital for further evaluation.

Her symptoms included dizziness, syncope, stomach ache, foaming at the mouth, vision disturbances.  911 was called and paramedics arrived..  Her vital signs were all normal.  Patient did not wish to go to hospital, and her mother took her home.  Other pertinent information is that patient has a history of seizures and had been off of her seizure medication for 4 weeks.  I believe that I understood her mother to say that her neurologist knew she was getting the vaccine today.  Patient reported no allergies to any other vaccine, medication, or other.

                                                I felt completely normal after getting the vaccine. Then at 8 pm (5 hours after getting it) I felt heat rushing to my head and face. I became very weak in my legs and I had to lay down. I took ibuprofen at 9 pm because my body aching was very intense. I woke up at 11:30 pm with such terrible body aches I could not sleep and I was crying from the pain. I had freezing chills and a throbbing headache. When I tried to stand up, I almost fell over because I felt so light-headed. I thought I was going to faint. I was so concerned about the amount of pain I was in that I called my doctor and public safety came and checked on me. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed for 3 hours. I drank Gatorade and took more ibuprofen. I was able to check my temperature. I had a 101-103 degree fever.  The entire next day (Tuesday) I took ibuprofen every six hours. My body was still very weak and aching everywhere as well as a headache. I stayed in bed the entire day. Today (Wednesday) I feel much better??both of my arms still ache a lot and my body feels exhausted.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after injection, I woke up after sleeping for an hour with excruciating pain in all of my limbs, especially the injection site. I could not move any of my limbs. Not because of pain, I simply could not move them. I had a fever (temp not recorded, I could only tell because I was burning up.) I was very nauseous, but never vomited. I was shaking very hard and had the chills despite being covered by a blanket and simultaneously burning up. Both of my ankles that I had suffered a running injury to several weeks ago (I have an upcoming doctor&#39;s appointment to get them checked out) were pulsing with pain. I developed a minor headache. Eventually I either drifted back to sleep or stayed awake, because I don&#39;t remember anything up until around 5am when I was able to get up and take Tylenol and water. All symptoms were gone except for the minor headache.

Tylenol helped the fever and headache.  She slept most of the day following the shot.  By the next morning, she was feeling better, slight fever of 100.2.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine  Chills, muscle aches, mild headache, a sudden reduced ability to hear and see, cold sweat, lightheadedness, disorientation  Starting at approximately 1:00 am on 4/08/21 I woke up with a throbbing left arm, muscle aches, a very mild headache, and chills accompanied by bouts of uncontrollable shivering.  I experienced these cold like symptoms throughout the night.  At around 6:00 am, I woke up with a very mild headache and muscle aches.   I took my temperature, and had a 101 degree Fahrenheit fever. I rested, and took my temperature multiple times that morning-- which had been gradually decreasing. At around 11:30/12:00 I experienced a sudden onset of extreme fatigue followed closely by a greatly reduced ability to hear and see, along with extreme lightheadedness and the feeling like I was going to pass out. I suddenly became cold, and my body was drenched in sweat in a matter of seconds.  I think the whole experience lasted around 10 minutes, before it eventually began to pass. I could see clearly again  and began to regain my hearing, however I still experienced some lingering auditory complications for an additional three- five minutes ( it sounded like a throbbing white noise). After that, I felt a little disoriented and tired. My aunt had taken me to Urgent Care, but they turned me away, saying I needed to go to the ER. However, by that time my symptoms had passed and I was feeling ok. So I went home and rested. By the next morning, I felt I had completely recovered

                                                After about 4 hours of having the shot, I got extremely light headed and nauseous. About the same time I got really bad chills and was shaking aggressively from the cold and got very bad pain in my joints, back, neck and injection site. My skin felt very sensitive and hurt to touch.  I took medication and felt a little better but was unable to eat due to the nausea. A few hours later I still had very sensitive skin and nausea but I was very hot and couldn?t cool off. The following morning at about 8am on April 9 I woke up with hives on my ears, back of my neck up to the top of my head and the center of my chest. I still had severe body pains and my hives spread throughout the day to my face, inflating my forehead, nose and lips. I was still unable to eat because of the nausea and I was still taking ibuprofen which usually eliminates my hives. My body pain, nausea and hives stayed consistent the entire day despite taking the proper medication precautions. At about 12:30am on April 10 I checked my temperature at 100.3 degrees. At 2:30am it dropped to 98.9 degrees. The first meal I was able to eat was at about 7:30am on April 10 while take over the counter anti-nausea medication. It?s currently about 5:15pm on April 10 and most of my hives have reduced to redness, my body pain and injection site pain is still consistent and my nausea has barely reduced.

                                                I got the vaccine at 3:45 arm was sore but I wasn?t worried Later that night around 6 I started feeling disgusting from vaccine so I took an Advil.  Around 8-10pm my body started getting chills, I started shaking, I had a headache my muscles were sore, and I started getting a fever. Around 12am all of the previous symptoms got worse my fever was at about 101 and rising and I was extremely tired. At 1am I felt the worst I have ever felt in my entire life. I could barely walk because my muscles and joints hurt and my fever was over 102.5 and I felt like my veins were on fire. At 2 am I moved to my bathroom because the floor was cold and I didn?t want my roommate seeing me cry from how much pain I was in. I have a high pain tolerance but this was the worst pain I?ve ever been in. In the bathroom I was at the peak of the pain of the vaccine. My fever was over 103 all of my previous side effects were worse than ever I felt weak and a little dizzy. I also was having a hard time breathing, my breathing was weak and I felt like I wasn?t getting enough air. I tried looking up on my phone if I should go to the hospital but I could barely pick up my phone to type or look. I dropped my phone and fell asleep in the floor for 20 minutes before I woke up. I walked slowly over to my bed and took a Tylenol and then had a sip of water and felt like I was going to puke. I tried to use my inhaler and I couldn?t hold my breath to use it. I crawled into bed and slept until 11 the next day and was too sore to walk to class all of my joints still hurt and I had a fever of 101 and a headache . I took a Tylenol and around 6pm my fever broke and I was feeling better. The next day I was still too sore to walk to class and had a headache. Today I am still sore but better my lungs still feel a little tight, I feel unfocused , and I still feel dizzy occasionally. I have no appetite and I feel nauseous when I eat so I?ve been eating in smaller portions . Every single day since the shot I?ve felt very tired. I hope these symptoms get better and Looking back on the night of vaccine I should have gone to the hospital.

Felt these symptoms from about 4:00 PM until about 11:00 PM when I went to sleep. The next morning, 24 hours after receiving the vaccine, my head still ached/throbbed, and my back still felt incredibly awful. My left shoulder was also still very sore. As of now, almost 60 hours after the vaccine, the only symptom still remaining is the very sore shoulder. I cannot extend it fully without immense pain, but it still hurts otherwise.

                                                She felt totally fine after the shot and many hours after.  She felt fine to go to a horseback ride lesson at 4.  Half way through the lesson she acutely felt like she was going to faint/nauseous (she had a ton to eat that day, had a bottle of water just before lesson, etc. so she knew it wasnt those kinds of things) and then had a crushing headache with a lot of &#34;pressure behind her eyes&#34;, dizziness, and a really &#34;strange&#34; feeling like out of body, bawling crying, and started FREEZING.  I got there 15 minutes later and she was under lots of blankets, white as a sheet, freezing, said her spine was sore from the top to bottom... just tons of symptoms.  When I got her, she moved to my car and had seat heater on high and I had to put all the clothes from a suitcase I had in my car on top of her bc she was so cold and her skin was burning up.  I gave her 3 200 advil and a bottle of water.  ½ hour later i had a thermometer and even after that she still had 102.3 fever.  She was rambling some nonsense and seemed very disoriented for a while. She went straight to shower and laid on the floor of the shower for ½ hour, took cold medicine, and evnetually went to sleep.  In the night she was freezing again and the fever had spiked and she took more advil.  The next day she felt much better in the morning and fine by lunchtime.  She was VERY sick/uncomfortable with basically every symptom under the sun.

She had pale blue lips, ringing in ears, changes in vision/blurry vision, she felt dizzy/light headed. The symptoms began improving at roughly 12:10 and had almost completely resolved by 12:15. I kept the patient for an additional 15 minutes for monitoring. I counseled patient on what to do if they felt as though they were going to pass out. I provided a cold compress for the back of the patient&#39;s neck, and had ammonia inhalant on standby but didn&#39;t have to use to help keep patient conscious.  By 12:30 the patient was feeling completely normal again. Her mom/stepmom was with her and was able to drive her home. I asked them to reach out in case of any other symptoms developed.

Patient was pale and lightheaded/dizzy and complained of blurred vision severe enough that she could not see my hand in front of her face. Patient remained concious. Pt was instructed to place their head within their lap and remain in the chair and was given a cold water to sip. within ~ 10min the vision changes returned to normal, &amp; the lightheadedness subsided after 15 min.

                                                Within 5 minutes of receiving vaccine, patient was hot and covered in a full body sweat, seeing spots, kept losing consciousness, nauseous. I couldn&#39;t get a reading on the BP monitor at that time as it was too low to read and she couldn&#39;t move her limbs. While waiting  for EMS she could breathe fine, I could feel a faint pulse, but I had to keep taping her leg and talking to her to keep her awake. She was able to tell us her name and how many fingers I was holding up. I kept trying to get her to squeeze my hand, but I could only feel the tips of her fingers twitching and the whole time she was unable to move her feet/toes. I was able to look at her HR on her watch right before EMS arrived and it was at 62 and by that time her body temp seemed to be back to normal as her Mom said she felt cool and clammy. The BP reading by EMS was 100/60 and they tried to get her to stand but she couldn&#39;t and she still kept wanting to roll her head back and sleep.

She remained sitting, but was on the verge of passing out. Our technician then called 911 and they advised not to give patient any water. Paramedics arrived and took her to the hospital for observation. Appears to be a vasovagal response to the vaccine.

                                                At first once I received the vaccine I felt completely fine. Later that evening I started to lose my breath and had a fever. By 9:00pm I was unable to move the left side of my body, had sharp pains throughout my body, and involuntarily urinated and vomited. This continues until 12:00pm Friday, the vomiting and urinating involuntarily stopped but the high fever, body pains, and numbness continued until Sunday evening. Now I still am experiencing random sharp pains and numbness on the left side of my body to the point where I cannot move it at all. I am throwing up occasionally (which has never happened before), and I have had a headache and insomnia since I got the vaccine. Pains behind my eye, loss of appetite and weight loss have occurred since.

The next morning at the breakfast table she began crying and shouting that she had lost her vision and everything went dark.  Within minutes she stopped breathing and her eyes rolled back in her head.  Her body went rigid and her mother caught her as she was falling backward in her chair. Her skin was white and her lips blue.  I administered CPR and after approximately 4 mouth to mouth breathes she began breathing again.  When she regained conciousness she said she could not hear.  The paramedics arrived and tended to her.

                                                Roughly six hours after receiving the vaccine, I began to get the chills, and I couldn&#39;t stop shaking. Roughly an hour to an hour and a half later, the chills/shaking stopped, only to be replaced by a fever. My temperature shot up, my ears began to ring, and my head began to pound. When I tried to eat, I felt sick to my stomach.   My fever lasted for the entire evening, and I spent most of the night alternating between chills and heat flashes. My head continued to pound, and whenever I tried to sit up, I felt dizzy. At around 4am, I awoke with an upset stomach, diarrhea, and further dizziness.   By around 8-9am, my fever had subsided, and I was beginning to feel a bit better. However, I have been feeling physically drained and a little achy today (03/26).

When I was called to help her, she had fainted.  She was able to slowly respond to us and was breathing.   We placed her on the floor laying on her side.  A cold compress was placed on the back of her neck and a pillow was placed under her head.  9-1-1 was called.  When EMS responded, she had normal blood pressure and blood sugar, but was still feeling &#34;out of it&#34;.  She was place on a stretcher and taken to the ambulance, but did not get transported.  She had a family member pick her up from the clinic.  She was able to walk from the ambulance to the car on her own.

Starting at 7:00PM (April 6/same day), I suddenly felt extremely dizzy, nauseous, and my entire body is aching to the point of tears. My lower abdomen and spine/hips are also in terrible pain. I?m in too much pain to sleep even though I?m exhausted and for a little while, I was struggling to catch my breath. I also have chills and feel that a fever is not far off.

After about 5 minutes I checked on her and she said she was feeling very dizzy.  I called management for assistance and got her ice packs for neck and forehead. I took her blood pressure and it was 150/90, HR 73. We laid her down and elevated her legs.  She said that she felt some pressure in her chest but she had pulled a muscle there the day before and wasn&#39;t sure if it was related.  She said the room was spinning as she continued to lay on the ground and it was not improving.  Her blood pressure was taken about 5 minutes later and it was 143/85 HR 73.  She said it is usually low.   She had no signs of local reaction, hives, or swelling.  She complained of nausea.  After a few more minutes she said she was not feeling any better and was having pain in her throat and difficulty breathing.  I asked her to try to take a deep breath and she was gasping for air, unable to breathe deeply.  I administered epinephrine (one dose) and called 911.  I rechecked blood pressure while waiting for paramedics and it was 125/80.  She was taken to hospital when they arrived.  Her mom arrived shortly before the ambulance and went with her.  Pt never lost consciousness.  Management followed up with patient this evening and patient is home and well, but the ER did classify the event as an allergic reaction.

It started off with a slight headache and body aches with pain in my injection spot. My whole body started to shiver uncontrollably. My body aches focused on my spine and I started to become dizzy and nauseous. Around 4:00 am, the worst migraine, I have ever had that encased my whole head, lasted for about 12 hours with hot flashes. After the migraine, my body and head is sensitive to rapid motion and loud noises.

I felt extremely dizzy after recieving the vaccine, and I&#39;ve never felt like that after any shot before, sho I was concerned. Within five hours, I started feeling really weak, and I developed a fever. In an hour, my fever rose to 104, my hands and feet were blue, and I felt so cold my fingers and feet were numb. I couldn&#39;t breathe, and I started coughing every time I took a deep breath. My entire body ached and I had stabbing pains in my abdomen. This was the worst pain I had ever felt in my life.

Patient was unresponsive for approximately 30 seconds. She came to and was very disoriented and her pupils were extremely dilated. The paramedics came and did blood pressure checks and several other evaluations. They advised her to go with them by ambulance to the ER to be evaluated due to falling directly on her face/head. Patient went outside and was evaluated further in the ambulance but was not willing to go to the ER.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA About 8 hours after the vaccine, I developed a fever and chills. Then when I went to bed at 9:30 pm I had extreme thirst. I tried falling asleep but my fever got worse, chills worsened, I developed body aches, and I got a massive headache. I ended up not being able to get any sleep at all during the entire night because I was in so much pain. I felt tightness in my chest, stomach pains, super sore joints, and my body aches and headache kept getting worse and worse. When I got up to go use the bathroom I could barely walk because I felt so weak and was super dizzy. Later into the night my legs felt like pins and needles as if they were starting to go numb. I still have a fever, body aches, and a headache.

I tried to watch TV but it was too painful. I was really scared and I did not think the night would end.

                                                That night, around 9 pm - from the time I got the shot until then I was fine. At 9 pm, I came to my dorm and I got hot and woozy. My friend told me that my forehead was puffy (swollen). I laid down and I realized I was really really cold but skin was hot to touch. I think I had a fever.  I was shaky and shivery and trembling. I tried to take a nap. Fell asleep for an hour - don&#39;t remember that time at all - but my friend told me I went to sleep. My smart watch was telling me my heart rate was 120s and 130s while I was sleeping. I debated whether I should go to the Dr. and I called the school police and they took me to the ER   - at 03:00 am on the 8th - and they told me to rest for  day and wait it out. I still feel like I have a lot of adrenaline - my watch says that my heart rate is way to high for what I&#39;m doing. It&#39;s usually in 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s but it&#39;s in the 120&#39;s and 130&#39;s every day and I am really shaky with adrenaline. I have had a headache since Wednesday night and it hasn&#39;t gone away. If it goes past Wednesday, I will go to my primary care doctor but otherwise no treatment at this time.

                                                A few hours after I got home from getting the shot, my lower body started to ache super bad. My skin started to hurt like I had rug burn, but I wasn&#39;t surprised because that happens to me when I get the flu. My legs and groin region started to hurt more and more and I got the chills. It was extremely bad and I was sort of writhing but I told myself I was overreacting. At around 8 or 9, I decided I would sleep it off and went to bed. At 1:00 am, I got up to use the bathroom and I began feeling lightheaded. I thought I had just stood up to fast so I continued. As I walked, i got more and more dizzy and I couldn&#39;t hear well. When I sat on the toilet, I realized I wasn&#39;t going to be able to get back up, so I sat and waited. I started to get super hot so I took my shirt off. I finally was able to get up and walked towards the sink but I collapsed before I got there. I started drinking the sink water and ran my shirt under the water and put it on my head to cool off.  This really helped so I went back to my room to call my mom. I have never fainted before or come this close to fainting. For the rest of the night I had the worst migrane of my life that gave me aura in my left eye and made my left arm and left side of my face go numb, as well as pulsing in my head. The pain on my skin, and in my legs and head was still there for two days after but it was manageable enough for me to go about my day. I tried to exercize to ease the muscle pain but this did not work.

After a couple minutes she was responsive, but still really weak and tired and said she had blurry vision.  We called 911 and they came in and monitored blood pressure and heart rate, which was really low when they started, but did come back up into normal range and patient was feeling much better after about 15 minutes, but still tired.

                                                Pt&#39;s throat and tongue and jaw felt like it was swelling. She had extreme pain in her arm and her hands started swelling. She got a rash on her arms and on her hands. I took her to the urgent care facility and they gave her a shot of Decadron and a shot of Benadryl. They also Prescribed steroids. She was very sick like she had a severe flu. I was very worried as her mother. She was weak and slept constantly. Her arm could barely move and It almost appears as if she had had a stroke. She had brain fog and she wasn&#39;t remembering her days like she was missing memory. After five days, the reaction started up again so we took her to the emergency room. They did a variety of tests including a urinalysis, CT of the brain, ECG 12 lead, peripheral venous duplex of her upper arm. Everything checked out OK so they put her on more steroids and sent her home. Pt is still having arm pain a month later but finally feels better.

                                                First symptoms were fever of 103.5 at midnight on the 28th. I called the RA on call in my university department and they called PD - to come and make sure I was okay. For 36 hours, I felt terrible - couldn&#39;t do anything. About 1 1/2 to 2 weeks later, I started getting really severe back pain that made it hard for me to do things - even sitting in a chair caused so much pain or walking or standing for long periods of time made me light headed because it was intense pain. There was one instance, when I nearly passed out from the pain but I didn&#39;t as I called for help for someone to catch me. It kind of moves around - the pain - sometimes it&#39;s a along my spine and sometimes it&#39;s low below my shoulder blades. I&#39;m still having this pain. It&#39;s not on the same pain scale as it was a couple of weeks ago. It&#39;s more manageable right now. I do stretches and some medications and there are a couple of patches  - Salontas - that my dad uses that he recommended I try to use for backaches. I am calling my doctor today to make an appointment.

Other symptoms include headache, jaw pain, dizziness body ache (mostly lower back) and cough. None of these symptoms are normal for her.

A minute later she said she felt like she was going to pass out.  She leaned against the wall and her eyes started to close.  I noticed that she was starting to break out into a sweat.  I asked it she was having trouble breathing, if her throat felt like it was swelling or if she felt nauseous.  She said no, just dizzy and really thirsty and asked for some water.  I asked again if she was having trouble breathing or was nauseous and she said no, then passed out.  I took her blood pressure, which was normal.  After a couple of minutes she started to wake up, although not fully, and asked what happened.  I told her I had given her a COVID vaccine and asked if she remembered that.  She said yes then seemed to pass out again.  I then decided to call 911.  A minute later the patient woke up.  I asked how she was feeling and she said better.  After a minute she asked if she could sit up and I said yes, as long as she felt she could.   I took her blood pressure a second time.  By the time EMS arrived the patient was fully alert, we were having a conversation and she said she felt fine.  EMS checked her over but she refused to go to the hospital.  I had her sit a few more minutes while I filled out her immunization card.  When she left she said she felt completely fine.

                                                At 1259 client aged 19yo, was vaccinated in her left arm with the Janssen vaccine lot#205A21A.  At 1306 client  requested a bottle of water as she reported feeling dizzy.  Vaccine monitor brought a bottle of water to vaccination room and immediately observed client&#39;s eyes begin to lose focus, so client was supported as she fainted, and placed safely on the floor with her legs elevated her legs on a chair and within seconds she regained consciousness. RN conducted a neuro-check on client and confirmed client was AxO x4.  The zero gravity chair was retrieved and EMT summoned, and at 1310 client was assisted to her feet by Co-Lead RN and RN and transferred to this chair.  At 1311 water was offered to client and she took a few sips and admitted she felt a lot better.  At 1312 EMT took client&#39;s first set of vitals which were: BP 110/70, HR 60, RR18, and O2 98%.  Co-lead confirmed with Vaccinator that client had been appropriately screened, that client had denied past syncopal episodes and had ate food today at 1000.   At 1314, Co-Lead RN asked client again if she had ever experienced syncope, and she admitted that she had once when visiting her uncle in the hospital. Co-Lead then educated client that it is not uncommon to faint due to anxiety related to medical procedures and encouraged her to report this to her physician and to any medical personnel in the future during medical procedures so proper safety precautions can be engaged.  Co-Lead then applied a cold pack to the back of client&#39;s neck, and EMT took a second set of vitals: BP 120/70, HR 63, O2 100%.  Client remained in the vaccination room 1328 when she felt well enough to walk to the observation room escorted by EMT to complete a 30 minute observation period.  At 1339 when EMT approached client to take her vitals again, client stated she was dizzy again, so EMT requested she remain for another 15 minutes and have a snack.  At 1400, client stated she felt better, her vitals were taken for the last time by the EMT: BP 110/60, HR 56, O2 98%, and EMT then escorted client downstairs where her mother was waiting with the car.  EMT and Co-Lead RN educated client to take it easy for the rest of the day and seek additional care with her PCP or Urgent Care if symptoms worsened.  EMT observed client ambulating independently with a steady, even gait.

She told us ahead of time that she occasionally passes out with blood draws, but never had any issue after a vaccine. About 3-5 minutes after the vaccine, the patient turned very pale and passed out in her chair. She did not fall on the floor but slumped to the side as we held her in place. After she came to she threw up. We had called 911 because it took her a while to wake up. EMS arrived and she was already feeling much better. They took her blood pressure and cleared her. Patient waited another 30 minutes after they left to make sure she was still feeling okay.

I took ibuprofen at 8:00pm. That night at about 9:00 my fever was 100.8 and I felt extreme fatigue.  I woke up at 3:30am feeling both extremely hot and cold with a bad headache and my temperature was 101.5. I took ibuprofen again at 3:30am. I then woke up at 5:15 am with a horrible headache and was very hot and sweating. I put cold compresses on my forehead and back of my neck which helped. The entire night, my arm with the injection site was very painful and stiff to move.

Moments after (less than 2 minutes) giving her the vaccine, I was giving another family member the injection and patient asked if she could take her mask off. I turned around and she was very pale. She took her mask off and started slumping in her seat. She was taking deep breaths and reported no difficulties breathing. She then became ill and began gagging, at which point I gave her the trash receptacle to vomit in. I had a technician grab the patient a water and packet of crackers. After half an hour of resting in the chair, monitoring her breathing, blood pressure, heart rate, and getting some food and water into her system, she appeared and reported to feel back to normal. Patient&#39;s family member mentioned she had a similar reaction a few weeks ago when getting blood drawn at her doctor&#39;s office.

                                                Immediately after receiving vaccine, a cold, tingling, transient sensation was experienced radiating from the site of the injection up into the neck. Roughly 6 hours after injection (1 a.m., 3/9/2021) severe chills were experienced for approximately two and a half hours, preventing sleep. Patient experienced dizziness. spO2 was within normal limits. Temperature was measured w/ oral thermometer to be 101.3 degrees farenheit at 4:55 a.m. in the morning on 3/9/2021.  Treatment was a single dose of ibuprofen at roughly 8 a.m. (3/9/21). Pt. continued to experience fatigue and sporadic chills, with gradual abatement of symptoms over the course of the day. Pt. had no symptoms the following Wednesday (3/10/21). Pt. experienced symptoms the following Thursday (3/11/21), with a sudden onset of intense stomach pain (8/10 on NRS) starting at approximately noon. Stomach pain was more similar to muscle cramps (with aching quality) than nausea. Other symptoms included fatigue and some feverish experiences (such as chills). Treatment was conservative (ginger tea, peppermint candies, rest). Temperature taken that evening via oral thermometer (roughly 7pm, 3/11/21) was 101.4 degrees farenheit.  Symptoms were significantly reduced the following morning, Friday 3/12/21. Temperature taken approximately 10 a.m. was within normal limits.

Today I am still extremely fatigued and have a bad headache and dizziness. This was not relieved by the maximum dose of Tylenol.

                                                At 4:00pm I got lightheaded, dizzy, and achy. The lightheadedness was such that my heart was pounding, vision was lost for a second (similar to the effect when you stand up too fast), and the sound went out for a second. Around 7:00 I got chills, a 101 degree F fever, and headache. The chills, fever, and headache lasted throughout the night, but they were gone in the morning. The entire day after getting the vaccine, 4/1/2021, I had a metallic taste in my mouth. By the morning of 4/2/2021 the metallic taste was gone.

                                                Patient was given the injection and then she started feeling dizzy right after administration.  She sat with her head against the wall and dropped her phone and passed out for just a moment.  She had a slight tremor/shake for a few seconds. (I did not witness, unsure exactly what happened or how long)   She came too fairly quickly after being yelled at, are you ok?  When she regained consciousness she complained of being hot all over for a bit.  We gave her ice packs to cool down.  She felt hot for maybe 10-15 minutes, but felt relief with the ice packs.  She also drank some sips of cool water which seemed to help her cool down.

                                                It started with my teeth chattering and chills, but no fever yet. All of the muscles in my body had a severe tremor, and I had trouble with simple tasks like filling my nasal rinse bottle, because the tremor was so bad. My jaw was smacking the entire time, so hard that the headboard smacked against the blinds. Then I checked my temperature and it had gone from 97.5 to about 99.5. The symptoms got worse, and added in excessive thirst, pain at the base of my head where it meets my neck, pressure under and behind the eyes, severe lower back pain, muscle pain escalating on the right side of my body only, nausea, pain across the top of my forehead, and a weird heat sensation under my fingernails? Maybe and hour or so passed, and my fever rose to above 101, and I tried to go back to sleep. By this point the tremors were over, but slight chills and every other symptoms remained. I took my temp later and it was 102.7, and I again had all symptoms except the initial tremors. I also had tachycardia (super rapid heartbeat) and got dizzy for a second and have a little trouble focusing my vision when I sat up in bed.

I felt overall achy but still able to get up and do what I needed to do. Once I went to bed though, I woke up around 2:00a sweating, achy, and with a fever. I couldn&#39;t fall back asleep very easily and once I woke up around 7:00a I confirmed I had a fever. I am currently still bedridden with a fever, complete body aches, and slight feelings of nausea. As of right now it is 8:56a 04/06/21 and the symptoms haven&#39;t gotten any better. I haven&#39;t taken any medication since 04/05/21 at 6:15p ish, which was to treat my headache from yesterday.

                                                Hives on my arms and stomach developed within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine at 2:16. I left the facility after 30 minutes because the hives did not get any worse and I did not experience any other symptoms. At home about 8 hours later, I started feeling exhausted, weak, and my body was literally shaking whenever I stood. Overnight, I felt feverish, I had the worst nightmares, and woke up every few hours. On Friday (next day) I felt dizzy whenever I moved, nauseous whenever I stood, and once when I was standing too long I started vomiting.  On Friday evening I went to a local ER (all the urgent cares were closed) at my primary care Dr?s suggestion to ensure that I wasn?t having an allergic reaction to the vaccine. The ER determined that the hives were likely an allergic reaction but all other symptoms were reactions due to the vaccine.

Sore joints, and entire skull hurt. Inner ears also hurt. Slept or 12 hours Headache was also present most of the day before the fever set in.  My period started the day before and usually I have heavy days first. I had a light day after my injection and today it&#39;s extremely heavy. So it messed with the flow.

                                                I began feeling a migraine at 3pm. I took a nap and woke up at 6pm feeling extremely ill. My temperature was 101.5F and my entire body was in pain. I took two Tylenol as suggested. Over the course of the entire evening, I was vomiting profusely; I vomited approximately 10 times. By around 10pm my extremities became numb and I could not walk without assistance. I could not think or speak straight. I nearly fainted every time I tried to sit up. I tried to take ondansetron for vomiting but proceeded to vomit the medication as well. I wanted to go in to the ER because I felt like I was dying, but I do not feel financially comfortable doing so. All symptoms remained consistent until about 3am when I was able to sleep until 7am. I woke up with several bouts of diarrhea, intense nausea, and head to toe muscle and joint pains, as well as numbness and tingling in my arms and legs still. It is now 5pm the next day and I still can&#39;t eat or stand for too long without feeling faint. I still have diarrhea and strong migraine.

                                                Began with a head ache and slight dizziness followed by shaking/chills, after a while with those side effects I took ibuprofen. Later that night I had a fever, body aches and I woke up nauseous in the middle of the night. Other than being very tired and sleeping very late the next day all side effects subsided by Sunday March 14th.

The pain is located along her lower back, bilaterally. Sometimes the pain is felt in her buttocks. Pain otherwise is localized. Pain is dull, but intense. She rates the pain as a 8 or 9/10. Pain can not be alleviated. She tried a hot pack, with no relief. Laying down increases the pain, and the pain is so severe that she is unable to move. She feels afraid to move the pain is so intense. She has noticed no other symptoms. All other symptoms from the shot have subsided. Patient also became nauseated while in the exam room.

                                                Started out with a headache and dizziness within a few minutes of the vaccine, along with nausea. I stayed put laying down with a lollipop and water bottle along with ice packs on me for about an hour until I was well enough they thought for me to drive back to my dorm. Once I started driving the headache was back but I was driving so I couldn?t do much. Almost pulled over because I was getting over whelmed but ended up making it back to my dorm. Once I got back I changed and laid down in bed hoping to fell better. Things started getting worse from there. Throughout the rest of the day my head ache and dizziness got worse to the point where I was pretty unsteady on my feet. Chills and body aches also started and progressed rapidly despite no fever.  My nausea was present in waves but eventually dissipated around 8 PM.  I tried to go to bed around 11 hoping to sleep off the symptoms. I began tossing and turning. My chills were really bad and it got to the point where my skin was so sensitive that the clothes I was wearing touching and rubbing against my skin were hurting me. I was so dizzy and light headed to the point where it didn?t matter if I was laying down or sitting up, I felt the same, extremely dizzy and lightheaded as if cotton were in my brain or as if it were working too slow. It was like trying to process thoughts through molasses. Then around 1:30 I couldn?t take it anymore and thought maybe a quick shower would help me to at least feel better so I could sleep. When I got in the shower I immediately knew things were worse.  My vision started going black at the edges and black spots in the middle to the point where at certain moments I couldn?t see. I was fighting to stay on my feet and conscious and it was hurting to breathe. I knew I needed to get help so I stumbled to my dorm and collapsed when I got in the doorway to my room. My vision was spotty, my chest was hurting and I could barely breathe.  My hands and feet went numb as well, I was shivering, and my body temperature was a little down to about 98.1 degrees Fahrenheit.   I was transported to a hospital via ambulance my vitals were normal except elevated heart rate and O2 and  was admitted at 2:40 in the morning. I received a chest x ray and  my heart rate was better.  The dizziness was under control by then. I was discharged at 4:50 in the morning.

I could not move, and most effects subsided after laying in bed for two/three days straight.

I also noticed that for the past 2/3 weeks I have also had blood spotting with clots alongside my abdominal pain. It has not yet subsided.

                                                Johnson and johnson covid-19 vaccine eau  March 20th - allergic reaction to covid vaccine Johnson &amp; Johnson. Allergic reaction started approximately 2 minutes after receiving shot. It started with itching and redness on my arms and upper chest. After approximately 10 minutes, I knew something was wrong and I signaled an attendant. They immediately brought me over to the EMTs on site, where they looks me over and started drawing up IV Benadryl. In the time it took for them to draw up IV Benadryl and insert the IV, the hives on my chest started to turn into burning and ice sensations intermittently. As soon as they administered the IV Benadryl, the itching redness and hives on my arms went away within a couple minutes, and I was left with only redness on my upper chest. They felt comfortable with me getting a ride to the ER from my dad and not getting emergency transport. At the ER, they gave me pepcid and prednisone. About an hour and a half later, I started developing chest tightness and hives and redness on the side of my face. They decided to administer more Benadryl and start epinephrine. I was discharged a couple hours later.  March 22nd - I went back to the hospital, with complaints of severe stomach pain. The stomach pain lasted approximately 24 hours.  March 20th to march 26th - I experienced extreme fatigue. I was exhausted to the point where on Wednesday I took a ten minute shower and by the end of it I had to lay down again because I was shaking from exhaustion.  Symptoms improved slightly until April 5th where it started taking a turn for the worse.  April 5th - I started noticing black spots in my vision that wouldn&#39;t go away. They didn&#39;t move and they stayed in one spot for hours until I fell asleep and then they&#39;d be gone the next morning. They usually started around 8:00 or 9:00 at night. Sometimes a couple hours earlier. They came every day until Friday April 9th when they did not come.   April 5th to present - I also started noticing light-headedness, motion sickness when I stood still or sat in a chair, nausea, neck pain, and periods of muscle weakness in the neck. These symptoms have not stopped.  Friday April 9th around 6:45 p.m. I started having a bad migraine, I noticed in the bathroom at work my eyes were dilating over and over and over again rapidly. The pain was very high. I ended up leaving work early and going to the emergency room. While at the emergency room they treated my migraine with a cocktail of Benadryl, toradol, and compazine. It reduced the pain at the time, however it did not take away the migraine.  Friday April 9th to present - My migraine has continued from April 9th and is still happening. I have been having severe light sensitivity, sound sensitivity, and trouble reading. The rapid dilation of my eyes stopped April 10th, however my eyes stayed dilated until April 12th.  In addition to all of my other symptoms, there are others that I am not as positive are relevant. I have asthma and it has been worse over the past couple of weeks, it it is not usually worse this time of year. I&#39;ve been also been having quite a bit more light bruising than normal over the past two weeks and over the past one and a half weeks I have noticed red spots all over my skin. I was not sure if these red spots were normal or not because I do have them on occasion however these are darker than normal.

                                                Patient received Janssen covid19 vaccine, she was sitting in post-vaccination waiting area, when she became little headed. Patient closed her eyes and slumped over in chair and fainted. We brought patient to the floor and she came to. Patient stated this commonly happens after vaccines or giving blood as she has anxiety of both. She also stated she did not eat anything all day. Patient was given ice pack and remained in post vaccination waiting area for 30 minutes. Patient stated she felt fine shortly after laying down on the floor.

                                                I feel inclined to file this report in hopes that someone could study how receiving this vaccine affected my endometriosis. Please understand that I?m a proponent of vaccination and building herd immunity; however, women?s health is important and we have a right to be AWARE of ALL side effects. I?ve done my best to research this topic and was able to find very few sources on how COVID-19 vaccines impact menstruation. Aside from the lack of statistics, I found forums on social media platforms with women explaining how their menstrual cycles became irregular some way or another. I did experience the common side effects of fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, soreness, and fatigue. In addition, I experienced severe cramps, back pain, thigh pain, groin pain, and nerve pain associated with the sciatic and obturator. I?m happy to be vaccinated because my immune system is far from the best, but if I were to have known that I would be unable to walk from the pain radiating from my back, pelvis, and thigh I would?ve opted for Moderna or Pfizer. At this point in time, I would NOT recommend the Janssen vaccine to someone with endometriosis. At that, this vaccine should be nowhere near as political as it is! My healthcare providers should be more willing to validate my symptoms, rather than saving face with the validity of the vaccine. I was told since my menstrual cycle is irregular I must coincidentally be getting my period, BUT I have not experienced any bleeding nor even spotting. I have no idea what the vaccine did to my body, I have no clue why it would induce such severe pain. I?m glad that the ?normal? symptoms have subsided by the second day, but the nerve pain complicates walking long distance or carrying heavy objects. I think I?ll eventually make a full recovery in the upcoming days, but this experience was so frightening. I laid on the floor for hours crying after I vomited up everything I had eaten. I couldn?t sleep because I couldn?t bear to lay down for long durations of time- and by that I mean more than ten minutes. It genuinely felt like I was getting my period, but whatever it was led to no external bleeding. Again, I?m grateful for the scientists who dedicate their lives to such integral work. I just wish I would?ve known about what was internally happening to my body beforehand, I would?ve chosen a different vaccine.

I instructed her to remove her mask, place her head between her legs and take some deep breaths. Before she had completely bent over she lost consciousness and began seizing. She remained in the chair for the duration of the event and until the paramedics took her out of the pharmacy. I made sure she did not injure herself or fall out of the chair and when the event was over I called ED. I continued to monitor the patient until she was taken by paramedics.

                                                At around 11 Pm 10 hours after I took the vaccine, I experienced chills, then a fever, and extreme fatigue. The chills lasted for around 4 hours, and eventually my fever went away with it. I shook so hard my back, and my joints started to ache. I couldn&#39;t sleep because I was having hallucinations from the fever and the pain would wake me up every hour, I also had a headache. The next day my back still hurts, my head still hurts despite medication, the shaking has subsided. Yet I&#39;m sweating, I&#39;m still very weak, I can&#39;t stand up without getting super dizzy or experiencing extreme fatigue. If I think of food I feel as if I&#39;m going to vomit just drinking too much water can make me ill.

Chills around the same time, eventually developing a fever around 10. Used ice packs to try and help bring the fever down. Woke up in the middle of the night sweating through my shirt. Dizziness upon standing, leg pain and chest pain.

                                                It was around 5:00-6:00 PM when I started to feel very lightheaded all the time and had bad muscle aches. It got to the point where if I did anything but lay down, I would feel lightheaded and off balance. The worst happened at 3:00 AM on 4/10/2021 (the day after) when I got up to use the bathroom. I was washing my hands afterwards and nearly passed out. I couldn&#39;t hear, I couldn&#39;t see, and it was a bit difficult to breath. Luckily I knew what all of this meant and I sat down and took deep breaths until I felt fine again.

                                                Patient briefly slumped over and appeared to pass out shortly after receiving the vaccine.  This only lasted about 30 sec to a minute before she became responsive again.  Patient reported that this has happened multiple times before when she has received vaccines and was anxious (crying) prior to receiving the vaccine.  An initial blood pressure reading was 100/64 at 12:50.   She was then able to sit up in the chair and began feeling a little better, asking for water.  A second reading five minutes later was 94/54.  The patient then chose to drink some water and eat some candy she had brought and this seemed to make her feel better.  Lightheadness/weakness was the only symptom she complained of.  By 1:03, 15 minutes after the vaccine, she reported &#34;feeing much better.&#34;  I continued to observe her, seated, for 15 more minutes and a final blood pressure reading at that time was 115/74.  Patient reported feeling normal again and went home.

At 8:00 chills started, along with a feeling of all my muscles contracting , lost the ability for fine motor control and  fell asleep at 9.pm. Woke up at 12:45am covered in sweat feeling as if I was burning with a splitting heavy headache, had fever, don?t know temperature new house so no thermometer but it sucked. dunked head in sink. Legs could barely support me so I couldn?t go down the stairs for pain medication, went back to bed. Got cold washcloth at 1:00am pain felt pretty unbearable, couldn?t make it downstairs or move at this point so I spent night in and out of sleep unable to move. Muscles still feel like rocks and my head feels like it?s stuffed with a mixture of Vaseline and nitroglycerin, every time I move it feels like my brains smashing into my skull with little explosions. Recent development within the last 5-6 hours maybe?(3:00-4:00pm) centralized over my breast bone feels incredibly painful, hurts to breath and feels like something heavy is pressing it through my chest into my spine. Not sure what to do or if this is normal but it hurts really really bad. Accurate hours because I was lucidly texting my friends to make sure I wouldn?t pass out, so I have nearly exact hours when each symptom appeared till I could no longer use my fingers.

I immediately grabbed another chair and raised her feet above her heart level. She immediately stated that she was &#34;feeling better&#34; and started regaining her vision. we then offered her a cold bottle of water. She appeared very stable within a few minutes. We did call 911 as a precaution, they arrived a while later and deemed the patient was stable and their additional services were declined by the patient. I insisted the patient stay and finish the bottle of water. All together I believe the event was about 30 - 35 minutes before leaving. I encouraged the patient to drink plenty of fluids and electrolytes and to take it easy for the rest of the day.

                                                Several hours after getting the vaccine, my back spasmed out and the pain was continuous and I still have the upper back pain today. That same evening I developed the chills, stomach pain. The next day I began experiencing a fever, headache, nausea, light headedness, dizziness, chills, back pain, lock jaw, some numbness on left side of face, zoning out or spacing out. My period also came two weeks early. I had some throat irritation as well as the feeling of being weak and some neck stiffness. All these symptoms seem to have gone away by Sunday evening, if not Monday morning. Except for the back pain, the nausea, and the throat irritation and some head pain and some numbness in face seem to have persisted.

                                                I had the typical soreness about 12 hours after the injection. No worries there. The next morning, on the 10th, around 11:40 AM, I started feeling extremely dizzy. The room started spinning. I was standing at the time, and I kept standing, but other than that, I had no control. My hearing starting going fuzzy, starting with ringing in my ears until it sounded like I was underwater. My vision started blurring, as well, eventually going completely black. For a solid 5-10 seconds, I could neither hear clearly nor see at all. I was conscious, because I could think relatively clearly, and I could feel my eyes blinking and could wiggle my fingers, but that was it. Once the episode passed, I immediately sat down. About a minute later, I started having excruciating abdominal pain. The pain was wracking my whole body, causing me to go pale (as I later saw once I could hobble to the bathroom) and making me sweat. After about twenty minutes, the whole thing passed and I was left with minor dizziness and slight nausea. Now, three days later, I still have some of the dizziness, but none of the blindness, deafness, or pain has returned. All other side effects, such as soreness, have completely left.

I started getting goosebumps. That lasted for about 9 hours throughout the night. I also experienced nausea for about 30 minutes at 8:45 pm. I felt like I was going to pass out within that time period too. My head was also hurting throughout the night. My body was aching through the night as well. The only reason I am not sure if I had a fever is because I did not have a thermometer. My arm was sore for 3 days and I was also sweating throughout the first night.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  The morning after getting the vaccine I woke up feeling very tired and sore/achey all over. I got to work (I lifeguard at the pool on campus) at around 6:15am and helped get the pool set up. When I sat down to try to do homework I started feeling very dizzy and nauseous. The pool deck is very hot, so I decided to try to go into the pool office where it would be cooler. I remember walking through the door and into the office, and then laying down next to the trash can because I thought I might be sick. One of my coworkers brought me some water and Goldfish, and I layed on the office floor for the rest of my 45 minute shift. Afterwards, when I was looking for my laptop, my other coworker said that when I had tried to go through the door into the pool office I had run into the door (I later got a small lump on my head from this) and that I had dropped my latptop. I do not remember either of these happening, so I believe that I blacked out for a moment, and it was likely hitting my head on the door that woke me up. A small scratch and some mild pain in my foot leads me to believe I dropped the laptop partially, but not completely, on my foot. I felt very tired for the rest of the day, and a little dizzy up until about mid-afternoon. I spent most of the day in bed sleeping. Waking up the next morning I felt completely fine, and was able to go about all of my normal activities with no side effects at all.

I felt like I couldn&#39;t stand up. I started feeling the chills and joint/muscle aches by 8:00pm. I fell asleep at 9:30pm because I was so tired and woke up at 11:00pm feeling incredibly feverish, naseauish and weak. I couldn&#39;t stand in the shower I felt so weak. Then around 11:30pm I vomited all of the contents of my stomach. I didn&#39;t feel nauseous after I finished vomiting. The next day I still felt feverish and like I didn&#39;t have an appetite. I spend around 5 hours of the day sleeping. I felt more like myself by 7:00pm the following day.

                                                Upon receiving the vaccine, I immediately fainted (vasovagal syncope). I was unconscious for ~15-20 seconds. My apartment-mate who came with me for the shot laid me down on the floor until I could sit up again without feeling dizzy (~15 min). I also had pretty serious bruising at the injection site for ~9 days following the injection and my arm was swollen and painful (although this is a pretty normal side-effect).

I considered going to the ER. I went to a friend&#39;s house and the pain from my leg and calf was extremely bad and 4:00PM in the afternoon, I drove to my parents house. My parents helped me out of my vehicle and took care me. I waited to see if the symptoms would go away or if they continued to persist and finally went to a Doctor after 3 to 4 weeks to find out what was wrong with me.

                                                Began with chills and muscle aches. Got worse over the course of an hour until I was unable to get out of bed. Pain in my muscles all over from hours of full body chills. The chills stopped after two hours at which point an uncontrolled fever set in. Highest temp recorded was 103. Severe full body muscle pain prevented me from getting up or drinking water on my own. Small movements like sitting up or rolling over to relieve muscle pain resulted in sudden and severe nausea. Considered going to a hospital to bring down the fever and hydrate. After two more hours of applying cold compresses, the fever decreased to 100 at which point I slept it off for six hours.  Prolonged bouts of dizziness, dehydration and nausea over the following two days.

I got up to shower and get some food as I was going upstairs I grew very faint,  my vision grew black and my hearing faded. I was able to make it to my bed then ask for some help. After taking Tylenol, my fever began to be very hot instead of chills. I was able to fall asleep until I woke back up to chills again and taking more medicine.  The next morning, I was still dizzy when I walked around but the fever was gone. I was still very fatigued which made me unable to go to class or work. Day 3 I was back to my normal self.

                                                I felt fine immediately following my shot, as well as the rest of the day. Overnight I started developing a fever which I knew was normal. However at 3 am I got up to use the restroom. I was sitting on the toilet and then next thing I remember I was on the floor with my face down. I passed out, and I am unsure how long I was out for, before I realized what happened. I have never passed out before, and do not have a history of doing so, so it is unclear why I passed out randomly.

                                                My daughter got the shot at 1 pm on the 8th of April, 2021. (My daughter &amp; I both got the shot at the same shot at the same time). By 11:00 pm my daughter started complaining with feeling dizzy. She kept saying she felt like she was going to throw up, meaning she was nauseated. She was complaining with her bones hurting. We both got these symptoms at the same time. We both stayed in and out of the shower letting the shower water just run on us. I had to give her ibuprofen because she complained of a mild headache &amp; the pain all over her body. She couldn?t sleep at all. She cried. It had her scared. I fully believe she?s having an allergic reaction to the Janssen shot. I have fully read the Janssen ?fact sheet?. My daughter was having hot flashes &amp; cold sweats. She has ongoing symptoms &amp; it?s been 2 days since receiving shot including fever. She was having what I thought heart palpitations. We both swelled up causing our bodies to feel tight. We both were healthy before receiving the shot. We?ve never had covid nor tested positive. We are currently going to receive a check up by a doctor. The side effects of this medication is dangerous &amp; doesn?t compare to flu like symptoms.

We took her final bp and it was 117/73, she felt better and left on her own (walking unassisted). She made the statement that she does not like needles, and that every time she has given blood, she had passed out, or almost passed out.

                                                The night I got my shot, my entire body was freezing and I couldn?t sleep at all because my entire body was in so much discomfort and pain, especially near my rib cage area in the front and back. The following day was the exact same, except my front rib cage didn?t hurt anymore (only the back). I was extremely fatigued and I couldn?t sit down because my body hurt so much. The worst symptoms were the sharp ear and neck pain (by the ears). It was a sharp, sporadic pain, but it still hurts a lot.  It?s now been 2 days since the shot and the neck and ear pain is now more frequent, though my fever and some of my muscle sores are now getting better. I also feel extremely nauseous, like I?m going to puke anytime soon.

When I stand up my vision goes black, and I develop joint pain, muscle aches, and very bad nausea.  9:00pm - I take 500mg of aspirin and all of my syptoms persist for ~30 minutes when suddenly my fever breaks and I&#39;m sweating underneath my 3 blankets and I can think again as long as I don&#39;t move my head. Everything still sounds weird and my stomach and joints still hurt but I go to sleep. 4:00am- wake up crying from the headache and with a fever again so I take 500 more mg of aspirin and set an alarm to take more at 10am.  10:00am- I feel exhausted and really weird, I take only 250mg of aspirin and sleep the whole day.  4:00pm - I wake up feeling so much better. Kind of achy and still very nauseous, my ears still ring when I stand up.   4:00pm yesterday - now: I kept movement at a minimum and was still nauseous throughout the day but was able to eat at around 9pm. I think I may have had a low grade fever on and off last night but the headache has thankfully stayed away and other than a little bit of arm soreness and weakness I feel back to normal today.

                                                Around 6pm I started having normal mild reactions to the covid vaccine. Around 10pm I lost feeling in both arms and my lower legs, but otherwise was still able to move without pain. At about 10:30, the loss of feeling turned into partial paralysis and extreme pain where feeling had been previously lost. My hands refused to stay in any position except for a clenched fist or fingers completely extended. Moving my arms and lower legs was only able to be done with great difficulty. I was worried that it would spread to my chest, so I got up from where I&#39;d been sitting at a desk and began forcing myself to walk up and down my apartment hallway. I was able to do this though my gait was stuttery and uneven, and my pain was about an 8 out of 10. I was alone in my apartment at the time and my hands weren&#39;t working well enough to handle my phone. After about 10 or 15 minutes the nerve pain and paralysis subsided and hasn&#39;t come back since, but my leg muscles felt incredibly weak the rest of the night and my partner had to help me to make sure I didn&#39;t fall over a couple of times. I didn&#39;t end up going to the doctor or seeking treatment because it didn&#39;t come back.

                                                I woke up at 1am feeling fatigued. At 3am it hit my like a truck. My body was so weak I could barley move. I had an unbearable headache. I felt very nauseous.  I had extreme chills and sweats.  This lasted non-stop  until 6am.  I woke up around 10am  with a bad headache and like my body had been through something traumatic.  I felt even more nauseous and had very bad diarrhea . Anything I would consume would make my stomach go into a knot and come straight out. After 10am I felt dizzy and weak. I still had a bad beach ache; and medicine wasn?t doing anything.  This lasted until I went to bed around 11pm that next night.  When I woke up around 9am on Friday I still felt a little drained and a small headache. My stomach was the worst part after my episode on Wednesday night. Around 5pm medicine started to help with my headache so I would say my symptoms stopped about that time , not including my abdominal pain. My stomach pain lasted until Saturday evening.

I threw up 4 times and then continued to dry heave for another hour. My temperature hit 102. I then started experiencing extreme pain in my right kidney area. I ended up trying to take Benadryl and then  threw that right up. I  then ended up going to the ER and receiving  Zofran, Fluids, Tylenol, Torodol and Morphine.   I got discharged with &#34;an adverse reaction to the covid-19 vaccine and unknown pain&#34; When I was discharged I had a fever of 100 and on the drive home I was in intense pain. It subsided but I am still not feeling well, I feel very groggy and light headed in addition to the pain.

                                                About 9 hours after receiving the Janssen vaccine on April 9th, I started feeling ill. I had a fever of 102, difficulty walking/moving on my own, intense nausea, numbness in my left arm for about 2 minutes, and I spontaneously got my period (which was very regular up until then). I took Tylenol, went to bed, woke up with a 100 degree fever but feeling much better, and it soon dropped back to 98 degrees.  Today, on April 13th, I started having pain in my left arm and leg. Specifically, in my left bicep (not the injection site) and my left thigh. This pain does not feel like muscle soreness, but almost like a knot? I&#39;m not sure how to describe it, but I find it odd the pain in my arm increases a bit when I walk/move.

                                                History of Present Illness     This is a 22-year-old female who was previously healthy with no significant past medical history presenting to the emergency department after a syncopal event.  She was getting her COVID-19 shot today (Johnson Johnson).  After her shot she was texting on the phone with her mom, felt slightly dizzy and the next thing she remembers was lying on the ground.  Witnesses reported that she syncopized and had some convulsive like behavior afterwards.  She was not postictal or incontinent however.  She reportedly hit the front of her forehead on the left side.  She denies any chest pain, abdominal pain, hemoptysis, recent surgeries, immobilization or recent travel.  She reports that when she woke up her hands felt a little bit tingly.  When the fire department arrived they found her to be bradycardic however by the time the medics arrived her heart rate had resolved.  Her blood sugar was 110 on the scene.  Medics noted that she was orthostatic on the scene as well.   She currently is feeling well, has no complaints.  States that she has gotten dizzy before in the past with COVID vaccines.

I woke up 4/13 with a very swollen and puffy face, and the aches are still here. I?m normally very active jogging and in the gym, and I haven?t felt anywhere close to normal - fatigue and aches go hand in hand.  4/14 I had a very swollen face, continued aches and abdominal pain. I went to urgent care 4/14. 4/15 face swelling went down a little, moderate headache, continued aches and abdominal pain. 4/16 (today) face swelling was down more, continued aches and abdominal pain. Fatigue every day and reduced activity levels and work.

Mother reports that she had the vaccine, had no symptoms, and then started with a fever that evening of 103.  She was having cold extremities, numbness, tingling of the arms, face, legs.  The fever dropped and went away and was having fatigue and getting winded doing regular activities.  By Monday she continued with the shortness of breath and go increasingly worse as the days went on and also the.  By Wednesday she was having chest pain, numbness and tingling of her extremities and shortness of breath.  She went to the hospital, gave her IVs, says her BP was elevated and sent her home.  Mother told her to sleep and see how she felt.  By Thursday night 4/15/21 she screamed out because she was having chest pains and having chest and pains and not able to straighten out her hand and could not catch her breath.  She was then taken back to the hospital and said that she her BP was high and said that she had the Janssen vaccine, and said that she was hyperventilation due to anxiety.  Once they got her stable and released her again.  Mother asked the doctor if he felt that this was normal, and could see her throat contracting and that she was stable and to go home, and he said yes and that it was anxiety and that sometimes we get ourselves worked up about things and that was causing it.    The daughter has no history of anxiety, no breathing issues.   They did labs and everything was okay, her counts were somewhat off but nothing felt to be abnormal.      She then went to another Hospital as she was still not feeling well, and checked the other reports from the other hospital and they conferred with that information, gave her Valium and sent her home.    As the evening progressed on Friday 4/16/21 she started having chest pains and her girlfriends mother is a nurse and came and saw her and called the mother and told her that she did not like how she was looking, and that her SOB and weakness in her extremities and the tightness in her chest was not right and that she felt that she had a PE.    They took her to another location, she had extremely high calcium levels, and high blood pressure and her heart rate was high and she was admitted.  She has been on flushes to reduce calcium, and her blood levels are improving.  She is on Warfarin to prevent clotting.  She has had a CAT scan and other studies and all were negative.  She felt better yesterday, but she states today that she is not feeling as well, she is nauseous and gave her Zofran,  has a headache, and they gave her something a little stronger than Tylenol.  She is extremely fatigued and weak.    Mother said that she saw her on Sunday 4/18/21 and that she was not able to walk, they had to put her in a wheelchair, and her grandfather walks faster than she can.    They are presently getting her up to get her to walk and see how her strength is, 4/20/21.  They are now waiting to get her levels under control and to see if she is strong enough to go home.  Neurology released her from their standpoint as they did not see anything, but she is to FU with them afterwards and want to do EMG&#39;s as an out patient.

She was seated in our observation chair when the friend she was with asked for a trash can because she was feeling nauseous. He stated that she has a phobia on needles, and nausea was common. I went back into the pharmacy after giving her a trash can. I then looked over at the observation chair and her friend stated she was going to pass out. She became stiff and arched back in her chair for a few seconds before slumping forward.  We called EMS while placing an ice pack on the back of her neck. Once the ice pack was in place she became more alert and oriented. She vomited. We placed her laying down on her side until EMS arrived. She was alert and oriented at this time.

                                                When I woke up around 7am I couldn?t move my legs. I thought maybe I slept on them weird so I tried to wait it out. At 7:45 my legs still felt really heavy and hard to move. The nurses hotline said to go to the emergency room so I did. I had a lot of discomfort in my hips and my ankles felt like they had weights on them. I could walk unaided but it was slow and painful. I couldn?t pick up my feet. All tests run were within normal levels with the exception on copper levels. However it was decided that the heightened levels were not statistically significant.

At approximately 4:48pm, she stood up to tell staff that she was feeling ok and wanted to pick up an item in the store. A staff member saw that she looked unwell and asked if she was ok and she said no. She passed out at that moment. She was unconscious for approximately 5-10 seconds. Her body became stiff and her shoulder/arm trembled during that time frame of being unconscious. She refused an ambulance. She remained in the pharmacy for 30 minutes until she no longer felt light-headed. During the 30 minutes, she felt light-headed, hot and was sweating. She said she felt fine after the 30 minute wait.

Client said she was feeling warm and her head was throbbing. Client said her name. Client was eventually able to sit up in a chair and said she was feeling hot and lightheaded. Client asked to lay on the floor and legs were placed on a chair. Client said she was feeling better after this. PHN came back to the bathroom with ice pack, fruit strip, water, and apple juice. Client seen throwing up again, vaccinator was standing by with client. Vital signs taken after episode of emesis. BP: 113/84 and HR: 75. Client asked to take deep breaths and slow breathing, which client was able to do. Client said she was still feeling hot so client was given another ice pack. Client felt cold after some time so both ice packs removed. PHN asked another PHN to come assess client and Dr. called in to assess client also. Client was throwing up for the third time, and Dr. suggested we call 911 to get her checked out. EMS called at 1808 by other PHN. Client said she is only allergic to an antidepressant but did not recall the name. Client continued to talk and be responsive throughout entirety of event. Client called someone she knew to pick up her truck as she knew she would be going to the hospital. PHN took down name of friend, his number, and client?s keys.

About 1 min later, she started to feel better. She asked for water, and we gave her some lukewarm water. Her face started to come back to normal, and she started to feel better and better. She sat for another 20 - 30 min, she felt better and left the pharmacy.

When she lost consciousness, I supported her weight and she remained in the chair for approx 15 seconds until she regained consciousness. I  had two technicians to assist in calling a code white and documenting the event. At 10:43 am, patient lost consciousness and regained 15 seconds later. Once I knew the patient was stable enough to support her own weight, i held her hands to make sure she was not going to lose consciuosness again. I administered an ice pack and a cool towel at 10:45 am. Code white was responded to by associates from AP and manager. I observed the patient for 15 minutes, and AP associate observed for another 15 minutes for a total of 30 minutes. The patient recovered fully and had a friend drive her home.

She felt faint and let us know so we laid her down elevated her legs, and she fell out for a few seconds she continued to have a strong pulse.

                                                I got the vaccine Tuesday evening and felt fine until Wednesday morning when I got a migraine and a fever. Thursday I felt mostly fine just some tiredness and a little weakness. Friday evening I started to feel light headed and then by Friday night I felt a lump in my throat and my neck felt like it was burning. The burning continued into Saturday. I went to the pharmacist and he told me to take some Tylenol and an antihistamine. That helped a lot with the burning feeling. Sunday I felt very weak all day and felt more of a slight tightness in my throat. Monday the weakness and tightness in the throat continued just not as extreme.

                                                I received the shot at 14:30, in which medical staff in the jail&#39;s medical center watched me for 20 minutes to ensure there were no immediate reactions. I went about my day afterward with no symptoms. At 21:30 when I went to sleep, I got some aches in my joints and took 1 dose of liquid capsule NyQuil to help with the pain and went to sleep. At 00:30, the 7th, I woke up groaning in my sleep to the extreme pain in my joints and feeling hot internally. I decided to get up and take a warm bath to ease the aches. I went and ran the bath and all of a sudden while it was running, I had a severe need to throw up, but could not naturally. Since this was concerning, I got up and walked out of the bathroom and all of a sudden in the hall I got a feeling of impending doom and that something was not right and I fainted. I laid on the floor for what I would approximate to be 5 minutes going in and out of consciousness waiting for the blood to fully return to the brain. After this, I instantly felt like I needed to survive and that I felt like I could be dying so I slowly crawled down the stairs to get to my military ID so I could call the military&#39;s nurse advice line. I had to take a break and lay on the concrete in my garage because I felt so dizzy and so hot and began to feel my vision disappear like I was going to faint again. I waited a few minutes before getting back up the stairs crawling to my phone to call. When I called them 00:58, they told me to call 911 because they believed I would be having a severe reaction, though I noted to them I did not have a rash or hives. I then called 911 at 01:08. They sent EMT&#39;s to my home which took my vitals. I had normal blood pressure, SPo2, and temp, but an elevated heart rate of just under 100 and a high respiration rate. EMT&#39;s made the decision for me to stay home since the hospital did not seem immediate in their opinion. After this I stayed on the couch for a few minutes and then felt very tired so I walked slowly to my room and fell asleep. I woke up at 06:00 for work, and arrived at 07:00. In the hour after waking up I was achy, sweating, and felt light headed. I got to work and my Sergeant told me to go home and sleep. I slept another 5 hours at 08:00 and when I woke up most of my symptoms went away other than aches and getting flush very easily for 5 days.  At this current time all I notice is some random light headedness that quickly resolves and comes a few times a day at random and without cause.

I first fainted at around 4:00 AM on March 24, 2021 after waking up. My parents carried me down the stairs and I fainted again after that. I didn&#39;t receive any treatment afterwards. I had a fever for the entire day and was feeling dizzy and nauseous for most of that day. I haven&#39;t fainted since then but still feel a little bit dizzy every once in a while.

At this point I took 400 mg of over the counter ibuprofen which helped drop my temperature slightly to approximately 102.2 F.  This fever continued into the night. I took another dose of ibuprofen before sleeping, about 6 hours after the first dose. Along with fever I experienced strong shaking/chills, muscle and joint soreness, headache, dizziness, confusion, and chest pain/feeling of pressure on the chest. The day after vaccination I continued to have a low-grade fever of approximately 100 F which subsided by evening. All other symptoms subsided as well except for the chest pain. On the second day post-vaccination my only remaining symptom is the chest pain.

                                                Around 2:30pm on 4/9/21 (one day after vaccination) I got a Charlie horse in my right calf. I didn?t think much of it. About 20 minutes later when trying to get out of bed I got another Charlie horse in my left calf this time. This one was much more painful and intense. After it let up I laid there for a little longer and tried to get up when my leg calf, again, got another Charlie horse in the same place. This happened a total of 4 times, back to back to back to back. Each Charlie horse I had in my left calf was especially intense and painful, worse than any Charlie horse I?d ever had before. I don?t get Charlie horses often, but I have been a lifetime athlete so I?m familiar with the feeling. I had not previously worked out in the days leading up to my vaccine. I?m not even sure this is an adverse effect of the vaccine, I just didn?t know if anyone had had a similar reaction and have been made aware that blood clots have also been a concern with the J&amp;J vaccine.  I?m also unsure if my Zoloft, which has a warning that it may cause dizziness, may have reacted with the vaccine to make me incredibly dizzy. But around 04:00am on 4/9/21 (I work night shift) I became increasingly dizzy making it difficult to perform the tasks at hand. Enough so that I had to sit down and even reading words off a computer screen made me dizzy. I couldn?t drive home from work at 07:30am that morning because I was concerned with my dizziness. It had subsided by the time I woke up at 02:00pm later that day.

States &#34;I&#39;ve never bled this much before in my life&#34;  .She is currently on day 6 of menstruation and her periods are usually very light by now.  States &#34;I wouldn&#39;t be worried about this if I was in pain, but it just doesn&#39;t seem normal not to have any pain&#34;.  Patient reports she has been getting lightheaded the past two days.  Not frequently, but she is lightheaded with position changes.  Patient educated that this is a sign of orthostatic blood pressure drop and could be related to blood loss.  Patient informed that it would be prudent to see a healthcare provider to find the cause of her bleeding.  Prefers to hold off for a few days to monitor bleeding before being seen by a provider and has an appointment with PCP next week just in case she needs it.

                                                Immediately after receiving the shot I began to have fairly intense pain at injection site. It continued in waves. I began to walk around the store for the allotted 15 minutes. I began to feel very dizzy and faint. My ears began ringing and I didn?t feel well. I stumbled back to the pharmacy to ask for help. At this point I was also feeling like it was very hard to breathe. I explained all these symptoms to the pharmacists on duty and they told me to just sit down. After sitting down I still felt faint but suddenly felt the need to vomit. I stumbled to the bathroom where I collapsed in front of the toilet and passed out twice, striking my head and throat on the bowl. After awaking I was very disoriented and felt very hot and clammy. The pharmacist then came and found me and told me to once again sit down and continue waiting. After sitting down for about 5 more minutes I began to feel less dizzy and was having an easier time breathing. I left the store as the pharmacist was ignoring me and didn?t seem concerned about my symptoms. After arriving home I was tired and week and very very cold. I noted my body temp was lower than usual. I took a nap and then these symptoms continued for about 24 hours. I am now feeling much better.

She remained seated for another 20 minutes and felt fine so she left and shopped for the next hour and felt fine.

                                                Patient came in for Janssen COVID vaccine that was scheduled electronically online.  All appropriate prescreening was done and patient had no previous allergies or issues.  Patient was instructed to sit in one of the chairs designated for post vaccine observation for 15 minutes after her vaccine.  Within a minute or so  patient felt light headed and like she might pass out. She notified the technician who was right there and he notified me.  I assisted her to a sitting position on the floor from her chair and I was able to ease her back to a lying down position from there with her head on the floor and feet elevated above heart on a chair.  Patient was able to talk the whole time.  She told us at that point when she was younger she was scared of shots and had fainted when having them, but thought she was past that and did not mention it during screening. She said she was surprised to feel this way because she was so excited about getting her COVID vaccine.  She had not eaten much today (a small snack) and had rushed here for her appointment without getting food. I checked her blood pressure while she was lying down and it was 94/63 and pulse of 75.  She said she normally had lower end of normal blood pressure.   She was pale when I started checking her, but her color began to return to normal within minutes. After 5 minutes she felt well enough to sit up and we got her a granola bar and water.  She remained this way for 5 minutes and felt good, so we moved her to sitting in a chair and got her a pepperoni and cheese snack tray from the cafe.  She ate this and waited for 10minutes and felt good. We walked her to her car and she felt fine.  I called to verify she got home fine and she did.

I started getting the sweats. After sitting for a few minutes, I tried to stand up and was very dizzy again. I immediately sat back down as I thought I was going to pass out. 30 minutes later, I had a nasty headache, the chills, pain in my knees and lower back, and neck pain. Also, I had pain at the site of the injection. I felt very nauseous. These symptoms persisted from hour 8 to 44 hours after receiving the shot.

Shortly felt a burning feeling in my chest and  collar bones, that spread to my head. My head started to burn, it felt like it was on fire, along with my neck and chest. I felt dizzy, like i was going to faint, the burning and dizziness lasted for about 5 minutes. Shortly after i felt like my throat closed up and I was having very labored breaths. The burning feeling in my body and dizziness came back, along with not feeling like i could breathe well. I went to an ER, they gave me an IV with Benadryl, and I started to feel well enough 2 hours later to go home.

                                                I passed out in my bathroom the morning after the vaccine shot around 5:30am. I called the doctors and they said that was unrelated to the vaccine, but I had intense dizziness and tinnitis before I passed out. I was incredibly fatigued all day long for the rest of the day and had a migraine - both to be expected. However, I am 3 weeks post-vaccine (April 3) and have been having intense muscle cramping and fatigue in my legs during exercise. I wake up with muscle soreness that goes away throughout the day and then comes back during exercise.

                                                At around 9:15 PM I started to feel nauseous and got out of bed to go to the bathroom. While using the bathroom I felt a very strong chill come over my whole body and started shivering and got directly back into bed and wrapped myself up in a thick blanket. For 45 minutes I laid wrapped up and was shivering constantly. At 10 pm I was brought extra blankets and a heating pad but moving to get situated caused dizziness. It was about 10:30 when the shivering stopped. I was able to sleep but got up to go got the bathroom around midnight and my entire body was drained of energy and I felt that I could barely stand and walk on my own. I was dizzy and my head hurt as well. I could barely hold my arms up to look at my phone briefly. Between 11 PM and 2 AM I had 5 or 6 high heart rate alerts (over 120) according to my Apple Watch but I did not wake up to them. In the morning (Sunday 4/4/21) around 9-10 am my head still hurt and my body was very achy and I felt very hungover. All day I continued to feel achy almost with a bad cold or a minor flu. Today has been better but I have still felt pretty drained. I?ve had continuous arm soreness in the arm I got the injection - but nothing too severe.   15 minutes after my vaccine on Saturday 4/3/21 I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and around midnight of that night I took 2 of pain relief PM acetaminophen (1000 mg of acetaminophen total snd 50 mg of diphenhydramine HCI total)

Took some ibuprofen, at 7:11am I still have a severe headache being treated by otc pain reliever. About 2:30am I woke up from my headache and realized I was freezing cold, dispute it being 74 degrees in my house. I did not have a fever but I had extreme chills, my entire body shivering and shaking at some points. This made it hard to stand or even get some water. These lasted about 2 hours or so. Once I was able to get warm again, under several blankets and a heated blanket they did go away and  I did not experience them again.

                                                I started experiencing side effects about 6 hours after receiving the vaccine. I experienced chills, sweating, 99.5 fever, headache, head pounding, dizziness, nausea,  tiredness, sore body, sore left arm, and had trouble sleeping. I took two Motrin pills and felt a little better and was able to sleep. In the morning, I woke up tired, sweating, had a sore left arm and sore body so I took two more Motrin pills and am feeling mostly better. Fever, headache, head pounding, dizziness, and nausea are gone.

                                                Initial injection was recieved with arm extended out and raised in car window. Really painful injection. Several seconds after vaccine injected I felt a wave of chills on my body and immediately started profusely sweating. Seconds after that i then began to get extremely dizzy, blacking out, trying to stay conscious for a personnel to walk by and after a few moments the feeling slowly lightened up minus the excessive sweating and chills. Personnel then told me it was just anxiety and brushed it off. I have never had a reaction like this from a vaccine before so this experience was unsettling.

During the night, fever spiked to 103 degrees, had uncontrollable shakes, chills, cold sweats, dizziness, and mild nausea. This lasted roughly 48 hours. After 48 hours, fever was reduced, body aches remained, but other symptoms subsided. I continue to feel generally unwell with body aches and a slight fever. In retrospect, I should have gone to the hospital.

                                                Prior to administration of Janssen Covid-19 vaccine the patient was anxious but was completely fine once the procedure commenced and concluded. After finishing explaining the possible side effects of the vaccine and handing the patient the V-Safe handout, she got up slowly and proceeded to our designated post vaccination monitoring seating arrangement. Upon concluding the vaccination process with the patient?s partner, she alerted the pharmacist that she does not feel well. To which he asked her to further elaborate on what she is experiencing. She began to say she thinks she?s going to faint as she is attempting to drink water. As she was having a drink of water she fainted. To which he responded by running over and catching her before she hit the ground, cradling her upper torso, specifically the head and laid her down on the floor with the assistance of pharmacist and her partner. In the midst of everything he instructed another pharmacy technician to call 911 for the paramedics. As she was in the process of drinking water I saw her other hand go to the region of the neck, thinking it was also an allergic reaction and administered a dose of Epi-Pen. He administered the Epi-Pen on the upper side of her thigh, directly to the skin not through clothing. There was a very brief moment where the patient began to convulse but gradually regain consciousness. The patient became lucid and was conversing with him, apologizing for the incident. He assured her there was nothing to apologize for and to which she told me she had similar incidents from vaccinations as a child. She did not mention this prior to administration of the vaccine and through conversation we believe the incident may be caused from high anxiety of needles / vaccinations. When the paramedics arrived, they assisted the patient from the floor and gave a warning that she believed she was going to faint again, and fainted in the arms of the paramedics.

                                                I was running on the treadmill and all of the sudden my feet started tingling. I got off the treadmill to try to massage my feet. Then, I felt nauseous and vomited. After vomiting I could not move and I had very hard time walking. I noticed that my face had swollen, my throat was closing, and my vision was blurry. I also broke out in hives. Once I could get mobile (about two hours after the adverse reaction started) I took a Benadryl and that helped ease the swelling.

I was to week to move for hours and when I finaly could get up and move around I was unable to even open my contact case to take them out because I was to week. The pain continued until noon when it lessened some with tons of advil I was able to move around slowly but pain persisted throughout the day and into the next 2 days. I finaly woke up pain free 4 days after getting the vaccine.

One week after vaccine developed tingling in left leg, two weeks after vaccine developed mild numbness/loss of sensation on left side. Went to urgent care and then to ER, they suspected complex migraine as I have a history of migraine (though had never had one lasting that long). Numbness has been intermittent since but seems to have mostly gone away.

She clarified during the pre-examination that she fainted after getting a flu shot  2 years ago. She said she has not gotten a flu shot since and she had not had one prior to that since childhood. She said he thinks she fainted because she did not wait to be monitored after her shot and left immediately. She was informed that she should wait 30 minutes after her COVID vaccine to have proper monitoring. Patient received shot at 5pm, sat out in the waiting area outside pharmacy. Pharmacist checked on patient at 5:09pm and she was slumped over against the body of her friend. Pharmacist asked if she was okay and friend said she is beginning to faint. Friend was advised to lay friend on the ground, legs elevated, and a cold compress pack was giving to apply to patient&#39;s neck and face.  At 5:14pm, patient was awake and alert. She remained seated on the ground for the remainder of her 30 minutes of monitoring. Patient left alert and well.

                                                Patient was a walk-in COVID-19 applicant. She filled out her form and told me she&#39;s very scared of needles and has fainted in the past from getting a vaccine. I asked whether she was comfortable receive vaccine at pharmacy setting and she said she really wanted the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine to avoid getting two shots. She appeared calm and the administration of the vaccine went smoothly without any issues. During the 15 minute observation period, patient&#39;s mother and technicians alerted me she has fallen over. I quickly instructed by technician to call 911, while the other paged CODE WHITE and I rushed to the patient. Her father helped me lie her down on their back (supine) and I elevated the patient s feet onto the chair. I took of her mask to listen to make sure she was breathing and she quickly regained consciousness and looked right at me. I had her take some deep breaths for me to make sure airways were clear and helped her sit down in a chair. I asked her to stay an additional 15 minutes to ensureshe is feeling fine. She decline emergency personnel from coming to the store. She was fine and left the store after 15 minutes. I will follow up with her to make sure she&#39;s doing well on 05/10/21.

                                                I received the Johnson&amp;Johnson vaccine on Friday, May 28th...within 6 hours of receiving it, I was experiencing nausea, chills and fever. It rapidly progressed within 3 hours to the point where my entire left side was numb and I had foot droop, slurred speech and a severe migraine, often associated with a stroke. I was immediately taken to the ER where a CT of my brain, labs, and EKGs were performed due to symptoms I was experiencing closely related to neurological issues. All came back normal, but my left side numbness didn?t subside, nor did any other symptoms mentioned above, even with medications. I was transferred to another hospital to see a neurologist where they ordered an MRI of the brain and more labs and admission into the hospital for observation. Everything came back normal again but still unable to walk and use my left side. It came down to a diagnosis of a hemiplegic migraine, which is a rare and serious form of a migraine with symptoms mimicking a stroke. I was discharged 3 days later and was told to follow up with my primary care doctor and neurologist for further long term care....4 days later and I?m finally able to walk but definitely no where?s near my normal self. Very weak and experiencing many migraines a day

My lips and fingers were blue. I was incredibly cold, shaking and simultaneously felt hot. I also almost blacked-out. The shaking lasted for about an hour. I continued to feel sick and exhausted for about a week, but felt much better after the first day.

                                                The first day I?d say about 3-4 hours after getting the vaccine I noticed a headache, was also fatigue, and slightly dizzy (pretty common side effects.) as the days went on I noticed that the headaches would not go away, they did with taking Ibuprofen and Tylenol, but would return 4 hrs after taking. Monday (6-14-21) I really noticed that my neck was stiff feeling, I was getting really bad random bruises on my legs, I would get really ?airy? feeling in my head, dizzy, my heart would start racing, and my hands would get really sweaty, I also felt hot even in colder temperatures. Made an appointment Monday (6-14-21) to get bruises checked out thinking it was from something unrelated, Tuesday (6-15-21) I made an appointment to make sure I didn?t have the blood clot they did a full work up, and noticed that my blood sugar was abnormally low (58) I do not have a history myself of diabetes or ever been suspected of being prediabetic. Tuesday (6-15-21) was definitely the worst of it. Later on in the day while I was working I was seeing black spots out of the corners of my eyes, I could hardly stand, I could hardly breathe (felt like a horrible panic attack,) my heart was beating so fast I felt like it was going to burst, my hands were extremely sweaty and I felt like my body was shutting down, I had a horrible headache, I could barely drive, and when my mom was taking me to the ER, I could barely lift my arms up. Went home as my blood sugars were then fine and I was feeling okay. From that day forward I noticed that at 6:30pm every night I would get these same side effects. Saturday (6-19-21) the pattern finally broke, I no longer felt like I was dying (I wish I was exaggerating.)

                                                Within seconds of receiving the vaccine I began to feel slightly dizzy. By the time I walked across the room to the observation table I was feeling lightheaded. They sat me down, gave me water and a cookie, but about 2min after the injection the dizziness was so intense that I began to black out. I was unconscious for about 1-2min, then came to but my vision was still unclear. I was taken via wheelchair to the paramedics on the opposite end of the gymnasium, and at this point I was heavily perspiring and very pale but still coherent. I felt my vision and dizziness significantly improve after being able to lay down. I was transported to the hospital for observation but had much improved by the time I arrived. An EKG, bloodwork, and cardiac tests were recommended to discern possible underlying heart related conditions, but I declined because I already had a PAT for thyroid surgery scheduled the next day that would be running those same tests. This reaction was likely due to not having eaten  for several hours prior to the vaccine. After about an hour I felt well enough to drive myself back home and dealt with mild aches and pains that evening, chills, and a low grade fever all of which resolved themselves by the next morning.

I started getting really cold, took my temperature and it was at 100.1. Got a headache, slightly nauseous, body aches got a lot worse (particularly my lower back). I was also feeling a little dizzy and having a hard time comprehending information; this was probably the fever. Around 8pm,  I took my temperature again and it had risen to 102. I took some extra strength Tylenol which started helping about 30 minutes later. I woke up 3/12/2021 still with some body aches, slight headache, and slight stomachache.

She began to feel faint and an employee of our facility caught her as she experienced a near syncopal episode. She was promptly placed in Trendelenburg position and vitals obtained. BP was 90/58 with mild tachycardia to max of 130-140 bpm. Patient was given supportive treatment and monitored. BP improved to 110/70 after 5 minutes and 120/72 after 15 minutes. Patient continued to feel very dizzy and weak, however, and became tachycardic and diaphoretic each time she attempted to move to a seated position. After 1 hour of monitoring and vitals showing continued tachycardia, decision was made to transport the patient to ER for further testing. Patient expressed agreement and understanding of plan to transport to ER via ambulance.

                                                I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine at 8:30AM on Friday, March 26. The only symptoms I experienced until that evening were mild soreness at the injection site, mild stiffness/soreness in my left arm and my neck, and mild body aches. At 6:00PM that day, I was driving and experienced sudden-onset nausea and dizziness. I experienced tunnel vision and my vision began to black out. I was able to pull off the road and began retching and dry heaving. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my lips and then in my right hand, each of which lasted for about a minute. The nausea lasted for 5-10 minutes, after which it dissipated and I started experiencing chills. After returning home, around 9:30PM I experienced a severe headache and a return of sudden-onset nausea. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my right hand again, which disappeared after about 5 minutes. I retched and dry heaved again, and I took two Advil. The nausea passed and I was able to go back to sleep. The next morning, the nausea had completely disappeared,  and the only lingering symptoms were a mild headache and mild stiffness/body aches.

When I attempted to take a shower, I fainted for a few seconds and it was a struggle to move. Only felt comfortable when I was laying down. My muscles all felt painful and sore, had a painful headache, felt very disoriented and woozy. It was a struggle to walk or move, and couldn&#39;t talk loud or for a long time at once. Had to go home from work and spent the rest of the day sleeping. Around 4pm, 24 hours after the injection, my muscles felt less sore and was feeling better. The next morning, I was back to being completely normal.

                                                I walked up the stairs to go to bed at 10:45pm and started feeling very dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseous. At the top of the stairs I passed out and fell backwards. Not sure exactly how long I was out, but no more than a few minutes. When I woke up I was disoriented and nauseous but didn&#39;t have the strength to get up. I rolled into my side and vomited 3 times. My fiance helped me get up slowly. He took my temp but I did NOT have a fever. The nausea, dizziness, and lightheadedness subsided after about 10 minutes, so I decided to NOT seek medical attention. This morning I have a headache and body aches in my lower back and left arm.

                                                About 8 hours after administration, I got severe muscle aches and chills, such that I was shivering uncontrollably for a few hours, not sure how long. Hurt like nothing I?ve ever experienced before. Considered going to a hospital but couldn?t think of how bc I wasn?t thinking straight. It got a little better around midnight and I could get up enough to take some Advil (I had before when I first felt it coming on), had an intense migraine for the rest of the night but migraines I can deal with. Now I?m just a little dizzy and sore. But that was the worst.

At 1030 pm, I started getting all over muscle spasms, headache returned, onset of dizziness, nausea and uncontrollable shaking. At 1145pm, I started vomiting, the muscle spasms got increasing  worse, the shaking only decreased while in the bath tub in very hot water. No fever was noted with thermometer, but after a second dose of 1000mg of Tylenol at 1am, I broke out profusely sweating 30 minutes later.  The uncontrollable shaking stoped at about 4am, along with the nausea and vomiting.  Upon waking up the next day, muscle spasms were still there as well as the headache and dizziness. By end of day 4-10-21 (today) all symptoms have resolved but the headache.

Fever lasted approximately 12 hours, and included heavy chills and sweating. Extreme fatigue, weakness, and dizziness. Metallic taste in mouth. Body aches, and especially soreness in the left arm (injection site). Loss of appetite. By 24 hours after the vaccine injection, almost all symptoms were gone, but soreness in left arm persisted. About 26 hours after the vaccine, I had extreme acid reflux which lasted a few hours. In the two days since the vaccine I&#39;ve experienced a ringing in my left ear.

                                                Patient received Janssen COVID vaccine at a clinic today at approximately 2:10pm.  When seated in a chair in the waiting area, patient stated she started to feel light headed and sweaty and has fainted before (not from a vaccine), so she sat back in the chair and then awoke on the floor.  She bumped her forehead on the floor and has an egg-sized raised bump on her forehead.  We applied ice instantly and monitored her blood pressure until she felt well enough to sit up.  She did not feel she needed an ambulance and refused going to urgent care. She is feeling fine other than the bump.  A worker took a report and I discussed with her what to watch for to monitor for concussion.  Her roommate is driving her home.  Event will also be reported today.

Sustained fever while feeling incredibly cold for night. Maintained low grade fever following day even while taking fever-reducing medication. Did not begin to feel normal until 48 hours after the vaccine, and even then felt worn and sluggish for a day or two more.

Meanwhile, my sister had the same vaccine at the same time as me (she is 2 years younger), and she had the opposite psychological reaction?weepiness, lack of energy, sadness. These symptoms went away when we went to sleep that night. For the next few days, we had flu-like symptoms (aches, fatigue, intermittent nausea).

                                                While sitting in a chair waiting 15 minutes after the shot she  was fine one minute and then passed out.  When she  came to the pharmacist gave her some orange juice.  It didn&#39;t help and she  was very nauseous.  When  she got up to leave she was totally incoherent, was unable to walk on her own.  When she got home she was no better so I first called our family doctor which both said take her to the ER.  There they did many tests and they all came back fine so they sent her home.  By that evening she was able to walk on her own and talking right.  She was terribly tired and still today 4/14 she is feeling worse but still not 100%. With the pause today for this vaccine we are very worried about this.

Most of the symptoms lasted 3-4 days but the extreme fatigue and sore arm lasted for a week. Symptoms were similar to when I had covid, but was surprised that some symptoms lasted a full week. Had to take off work for a few days.

I decided trying to take Tylenol to help alleviate my pain would just come back up as vomit. Within the next hour I had became increasingly nauseous and my hand started to cramp up and go numb. I couldn&#39;t move my hands. My husband then decided to call the E.R. and ask if this was a common reaction and they recommended we come in. We got to the hospital and my left hand had started getting feeling back and moving but my right hand had not. They preformed a neurological test and ruled out a stroke and that it was happening on both sides of my body. The ended up giving me a dose of tordol and a shot of antihistamines and sent me home with a prescription for ibuprofen.

                                                I received my vaccine at 5PM on 5/23/21. At 2AM on 5/24/21, I woke up uncontrollably shaking. My arms and legs and jaw were shaking so violently that I put sheets in my mouth to keep from breaking my teeth. I struggled to get to the switch to turn off the ceiling fan but realized that these weren&#39;t shivers from being cold (even though I did feel cold). They felt more like involuntary and rapid muscle contractions. My entire body (abs, legs, arms, jaw) were cramping and in intense pain, and I began to feel panicked. I attempted to control the shaking with deep breathing but this did not help. I took my temperature in my ear and it was 104 degrees. I took a muscle relaxer and Tylenol at about 2:30 AM, and began to feel control over my body at about 3:00AM. I fell asleep around 4:30AM, and my fever had not reduced. I woke up at around 9AM on 5/24/21 and had a splitting headache throughout the day, and was tired/in and out of sleep. I alternated Advil and Tylenol every 4 hours but my fever maintained at 103-104 degrees all day. On 5/25/21 my headache was gone but my fever fluctuated between 102-103 all day, and finally broke around 8PM.  On 5/26/21, I had no fever, but felt chills/overheated easily through the day.

Following the immunization she left the Personal Services Room to wait the required 15 minutes post vaccination observation period in the waiting area where there are chairs for the patient.  As the Pharmacist came back into the Pharmacy the patient, while standing in the waiting area by the chairs, complained of dizziness.   She then fainted and fell to the floor, hitting her head on a wall on the way down.  The Pharmacist had a technician call 911 and tended to her.  She was instructed to lay still on the floor in the position she was in on her back.  A nurse was in the area and also rendered assistance.  Patients blood pressure was checked and she was offered water.  The paramedics came and evaluated her.  She was later released to a family member who came and picked her up.

There was a brief moment of generalized seizure-like activity that lasted for about 10 seconds. After this, she woke up and was able to sit up. Patient appeared anxious. She was alert and oriented x 3 once she was up with a GCS of 15.

At 10pm I had become dizzy and short of breath and started shaking. Shortly after I started losing feeling in my hands and then could not feel them at all. This is when I was taken to the ER and admitted for three days. I had a fever as well.

                                                Until ~5PM adverse events were extremely trivial -- mainly I &#34;felt stupid&#34;. Starting about 5PM, I started feeling bad -- stomachache, strong muscle cramps primarily in the right leg (*not blood clot), and I staggered around dumbly much like a severe fever victim (*I had no actual fever). My period started about a week and a half early (typically only varies by a day or two) and was extremely thick and black, tar-like (typically is bloodlike -- reddish and watery). I did not suffer any unusual amount of period pain.  Symptoms worsened sharply between 9:30-10PM, when I became extremely sensitive to light and sound and lost emotional control almost entirely. From 10PM to 4 or 5 AM, in pitch dark and total silence, I laid in my bed raging at the &#39;excessive brightness and noise&#39;.   The next day (5/2) my emotional state returned almost to normal, but I was still &#34;stupid&#34;, and the leg cramps continued. I spent most of the day sleeping. I also drank obscene amounts of tea that I didn&#39;t urinate out, so I would assume that if I wasn&#39;t chugging tea like a frat boy on a keg during spring break, I would have suffered dehydration.  On 5/3 my mental state returned basically to normal. The leg cramps continued. Presumptive dehydration period ended.  On 5/4 the leg cramps began to subside, and my period became more normal (bloodlike, watery). On 5/5 the leg cramps and period ended.

I took tylenol (acetaminophen 500mg) and two glasses of water. As the night progressed, my lower back started to hurt and my headache continued to progress. I went to bed early to sleep it off but was woken up by overheating and headache. I took more tylenol around 3am and grabbed an icepack, this seemed to help alleviate the symptoms.
