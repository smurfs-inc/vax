                                                Dizzy, run down two hours after injection. Woke up 4 am then off and on with extreme body pain, sore neck , lower back, right hand and arm. Headache and fatigue at 6:45 am got up with two children (2 yrs and 10 months) ate small breakfast by 9 am I couldn?t get off the couch or stay awake. My head started aching and my eyes hurt, I felt extreme chills two thick blankets weren?t enough to warm me. Extreme fatigue, stomach pain and loss of appetite. I fell asleep and didnt have the energy to walk to my bed until 2:30 pm.  It set off my stomach and I was vomiting off and on until around 9 pm. By then I could keep little bits of fluid and food down. Then I was hot. I felt flushed but had no fever. My usual heart rate is 52-54 bpm via Watch while laying down. My heart rate during this hot period laying in bed was 102 -101 bpm. Which is consistent for my workout heart rate. I went to sleep and woke up 7 am with my kids and was well enough to take care of them but not do all my usual chores. I couldn?t bend down or put my head lower than chest or the extreme throbbing headache was back. Still had body aches and fatigue but nowhere near yesterday. It is 11:22 pm Sunday and I feel spent.

She had been waiting less than 10 minutes.  I went to her and she said she was feeling very strange and was nauseous. I tried to get her up but she couldn&#39;t walk so I let her sit back down. She was not able to communicate with me but was conscious. She said her vision was distorted. her lips started to turn blue and I continued to monitor her. I called 911 and she said she was having difficulty catching her breath so I went for the epipen and gave her 0.3 mg in the outer thigh of her right leg. her color started to improve and she was able to comunicate better. I followed EMS instructions and continued to monitor her until they arrived.

                                                A few seconds after vaccine was given I had a sensation go up my left jawline that felt similar to a nerve pain.  I didn&#39;t think much of it and waited the 10 minutes after my vaccine and had no other symptoms.  I left the pharmacy and started driving home and had a sudden sensation of a heaviness in my chest and trouble taking a deep breath.  I also felt like my tongue and throat were swelling slightly.  I had a warm sensation throughout the middle of my back that felt like a heating pad was on it.  I felt light-headed and called my husband.  As I continued to drive my symptoms worsened and I called 911.  I made it home in my car and the ambulance met me there.  My husband called the pharmacy to ask them what we should do and they said that it would be ok for him to give me Benadryl.  I took 15mL of liquid Benadryl shortly before the ambulance arrived.   Within 15-20 minutes, I felt like I was able to swallow better.  In the ER, I received IV Benadryl and Famotidine.  I was also given 800mg of Ibuprofen for a bad headache I developed.  My oxygen level remained in the high 90&#39;s and my symptoms were much improved after the IV medication.  I was instructed to continue taking Benadryl capsules for the next few days along with Pepcid to keep my symptoms from flaring back up.  I noticed this morning when waking up that the left side of my face as well as my throat felt odd so I took the Pepcid and Benadryl and symptoms were relieved in 30 mins or so.

                                                After about 12 hours from injection, started to feel headache, body aches, and nausea, by the morning 7 am, the headache was so intense that I could barely move.  (I have migraines, but this pain was on the left side of my head, not my right like usual, and was even more intense than usual.)  I had chills and sweats, and body aches.  I checked several times and had no fever.  By the next morning (Saturday, March 13 at 7 am) I was feeling fine.

                                                Head ache and fever started the evening of March. Severe vertigo and nausea began sometime overnight or early the next morning. I was bed-ridden most of the day. I took zofran and ibuprofen. From then on the severe vertigo happened only while changing positions such as laying down and getting up. I saw a nurse practitioner on March 16th who told me it was due to ear wax. I received a prescription (meclizine) for the nausea and dizziness and bought an ear wax kit. The next a friend said her husband had the exact same symptoms as I was experiencing and that it was called facility. My husband assisted me with the epley maneuver twice on March 17th. By March 18th the vertigo was gone, with just slight dizziness during the day.

After no side effects, I drove away.  Only to have a sudden reaction as I was driving.  I&#39;ve felt dizzy with flu vaccines before and have felt the same symptoms as with the covid vaccine when IV dye was injected for a CT scan 5 months ago.  Felt faint/ dizzy, Got severe tachycardia, thought my heart was gonna explode.  I drove back in a hurry, scared and confused. I was waiting to be seen, and no one ever came out.  Symptoms subsided on their own after 15 min, therefore I just left without notifying anyone.  2 hours after vaccine, my arm looked moderately red and swollen, with minimal pain.  7 hours after getting the vaccine I started with chills and body aches.  8 hours after getting the vaccine I felt feverish and malaise.  After taking Tylenol with feverish symptoms (didn&#39;t check temp) slept for 2 hours and felt a little better.

                                                I felt light headedness right away. The night that I got the injection, I felt kind of drunk. I felt like I had too much alcohol. I am very sensitive to things. I felt silly - loose - tired.  In the night, I had aches and chills - no fever. The next day I felt achy and really really tired. I had a pain at the injection site. That evolved into a left side migraine (the achiness and fatigue and pain from shot) It created tension up my arm and up my neck - and I did get nausea with the headache - on Saturday. Sunday, I felt a little bit better but energy was still low - unusual tiredness; couldn&#39;t exercise as I felt a heavy fatigue. On Sunday, I went to a dance class but it was difficult as I was tired. On Monday, I felt a tiny bit better but still fatigued and did another dance class which went a little better. On Monday evening, I felt like I did the night of the injection - a little loopy and &#34;drunk like.&#34; Monday night, I woke up with a Fiery, achy, itchy, burning rash on both of my arms and the tops of my legs. If I would itch it, it would exaggerate it. When I woke up the next day - the rash went everywhere in my body - it would come and go in different places - neck, face, down and up my legs and feet and on my butt. Pretty much every spot had the rash at one time or another. It was really bad on Tuesday morning, I called the doctor. Was treated with Benadryl and cortisone cream which helped with the symptoms. Tuesday night, it was excruciating - it was all up and down my legs, arms, neck and face and stomach and rear end and feet. It was very achy, burning and itchy - very intense. It would hurt if I scratched it. Accompanied with really intense fatigue. Wednesday, after taking Benadryl, I woke up and it was a tiny bit better. It was still on my legs, neck and face. Sometimes my arms would flare up and sometimes they wouldn&#39;t. Any kind of exertion - like my dance class - would trigger the rash - so I took a break from exercising that week.  It started getting incrementally better - very slowly. Still there on Thursday - still fatigued and I was still taking Benadryl. Friday, also. Saturday, it was pretty much gone but it would threaten to come back and I felt itchiness in my legs when I went for a walk. It still feels a little lingering - my legs are itchy. I&#39;m still building back my energy. Incrementally my energy is increasing. Still not 100% there but it&#39;s getting better day by day.  Note: My history with my skin: I do get flare ups when I get bug bites and when I get poison ivy - I have very sensitive skin.

Approximately, 5 minutes after vaccinating the patient, patient came up to the counter stating that she is dizzy and feel to the floor. We quickly went to check on the patient and patient stated she is feeling very dizzy. When asked if she can breath, she stated she is fine and the only thing is dizziness, which happened before. Patient was extremely weak and pharmacy staff helped her into the immunization room to sit and lay her head down. We got her some juice and chips, which helped the patient. Patient was resting for about 20 minutes in the immunization with another pharmacy staff. Patient was advised to report any other symptoms that may require us to call the ambulance. After about 20 minutes, pt came out of the room and sat for about 10-15 more minutes again. When asked the patient how she is feeling again, she said she is feeling normal again and that it had only happened to her once. Patient left the pharmacy in good condition.

While talking to the patient she leaned forward and was held to prevent her from falling out of chair. She was very sweaty and was slow to regain full consciousness. Emergency services was called where she was evaluated and found to have had a vasovagal response. Paramedics had her lie down before she was sent home.

Continued to worsen based on dialogue with patient.  Tried to take blood pressure manually as well as with automated cuff but too low to detect.  Pt stated she felt tingly all over, hot , clammy, dizzy and was made worse by opening her eyes.  Put ice packs on neck and forehead as well as wet cloth.  Pt requested water but we declined as to not knowing severity or extent of reaction yet.  Based upon pt not improving and lack of palpable pulse decision to involve EMS was made.  Upon ems arrival 10 min later pt was taken to their transport vehicle for further evaluation.   At that time they observed vitals to be normal, monitored for additional 10-15 minutes and determined pt had adverse reaction, not allergic reaction.  Pts caregiver called us to let us know she was fine on drive home and improved rapidly en route.  Noted pt drove 2-3 hours for appointment, in convertible with temps in mid -upper 70&#39;s and noted she was possibly hot upon arrival and this could have precipitated reaction to injection.

                                                My vaccine was administered at 12:30pm. I waited until 12:55 at CVS after the vaccine to make sure there were no reactions. I also move my arm around a lot after the injection to keep it from hurting. I drove home, at lunch and about 2:45 was hit with a very noticeable headache. I never get headaches and eat healthy and consume about a gallon of water a day. I knew it wasn&#39;t from dehydration or being hungry.  Headache was in the temple area and made my eyes hurt in the same way they would if you had cried for an extended period of time or were overtired. At 3pm a wave of exhaustion hit me. I was sitting working trying to combat the headache and felt almost wiped out. I got through the rest of my work day (4:30) and went to lay down immediately. I passed out almost instantly until 7 pm. I work up and showered, ate dinner and started to feel a little warm. It should be noted it was an unseasonably warm day and got up to 77, so it was a tiny bit warm in my home. I put on loose fitting clothes and slayed on the couch still with the bad headache and the injection site started to throb so I placed and ice pack on for 20 minutes. I could only stay awake until 8:45 and got in bed. I could not get comfortable for several hours feeling very warm. I tried a fan on high and drinking more water but i felt very warm like how you feel with the flu. I took my temp at 1130pm it was normal. I continued to toss and turn and feel very warm and slightly dizzy, in the sense that I hadn&#39;t been able to sleep and with the headache my body was just exhausted. Around 2 am i woke up for more water and got in the shower because I had sweated so much my sheets were wet and my clothes. I got out of the shower around 10 minutes later, changed and got new sheets and got back in bad. Around 330 I felt very hot again and opened the windows and got another ice pack for my arm which was throbbing again. I finally fell asleep after 3:45am. I got up for work at 6am. I felt slightly foggy, and very hot. But no fever. My temp is normally around 97.4-97.9 and it was 98.4. Still normal but I was running warmer than usual. It took a long time to get ready and despite hot water in the shower I was freezing. i got dress and debated going to work. Got in the car at 6:45 and my drive to work is 30 minutes. 1/2 way into my drive I got very sweaty again and went home to change my clothes because they were too warm. Got to work around 7:20 and still felt warm but they take our temps at the door and min was still okay, no fever. I drank a lot of water and ate, and at 8:30 am all of a sudden the exhaustion was gone and I felt normal. I got home form work at 5:30p and took a 3 hour nap and felt normal again.

                                                Pain in arm immediately upon injection. Extreme dizziness, light-headedness, and a warm flush came over me within 2-3 minutes. Sat down on a chair, put my head between my knees. Wasn&#39;t helping so I sat down on the floor cross-legged and put my head to the ground to try to keep myself from fainting. A medic noticed I wasn&#39;t doing well and took me to a tent on the other side of the large room to lie down. She asked if I wanted a wheelchair and I declined. I barely made it to the tent to lie down before I would have fainted. Lying down was significantly better than sitting down. After staying prone for about 20 minutes, I was doing better so I left. Immediately after walking outside and feeling cool fresh air I was much much better. Dull headache approximately 19hrs after shot that lasted half a day.  48hrs post shot had tingling and numbness in injection arm that lasted about a day. Injection arm soreness for 3 days total.

Within an hour began to feel like I had taken a sedative (reminded me of how klonopin made me feel when I was taking it for anxiety).  Sedative type feeling lasted for approximately 4 hours.  Headache developed approximately 2 hours after receiving vaccination.  Headache and nausea persisted until bedtime.  Had major issues sleeping and had night sweats all night.  Nausea is gone this morning but headache is still present.  Some mild tenderness at injection site that is still present this morning.

                                                I suddenly became lightheaded and had extreme weakness, then collapsed, then immediately began having chest pain and pressure, shortness of breath, arm numbness, and uncontrollable shaking. All of these symptoms happened at the same time. We called the paramedics but all my vitals were totally normal. The severe symptoms passed after about three hours. I continued to have chest pain and pressure, but was able to breathe normally and had 100% oxygen saturation. I am not a smoker and don&#39;t have asthma or any breathing issues so the sudden inability to breathe coupled with the other symptoms all at once was very alarming.

The next morning  15 hours after vaccine my arm started to hurt so badly I could barely move. The nerves in the injected arm running up and down with shooting and  pulsing, lack of feeling in hands and extreme pain through the the arm and shoulder on the injected side.  The pain was extreme for 13 days I lost work time. I saw several doctors who sent me on my way. My arm still hurts right now 24 days since vaccine. The pain is not extreme but the nerves still shoot pain and oils and there is often extreme pain by the end of the day.

I tried to drink some water and my husband and I tried to walk to the tent for observation. I fell down and fainted. I was wheeled in a wheelchair to the ER and vital sign and blood sugar and EKG were performed. I declined being admitted to the hospital for further investigation.

I felt clear headed but exhausted for the rest of the day.  My chest has been tight and congested since then. Hard to breath and my voice is rough and raspy. This is ongoing and I still have chest tightness and a raspy voice.  On 4/12/21 I started having horrible joint and muscle aches again throughout my body and felt so tired. Horrible headache and stomach pain, bloating and nausea.

Experienced blackout segments. Took 1 dose of 100mg Sumatriptan at about 930pm and tried to sleep w/the immense pain. Took 2nd dose at about 12am. Pain did not dissipate but fell asleep. When i woke up pain was gone but felt very sore, dizzy and disoriented. Fast forward to April 9th while laughing uncontrollably the right side of my face spasmed/cramped  closing my right eye and contracting my right cheek as if having Bell&#39;s Palsy. I have never experienced this before. Face did not continue to droop but has left a tick/twitch sensation under my right eye.

I also had a headache and fever of 100-102 degrees. I was in bed for three days and I was still very fatigued for a whole week. My hands and legs were swelling off and on. I also had some shortness of breath, coughing and chest pain. I was dizzy and lightheaded. I have been very uncomfortable and unable to sleep. I still have tingling and pain in my feet. I get easily winded and I am still experiencing headaches. It has been almost three weeks. My feet and hands are still swelling and my hands are very red. I am seeing my doctor today for a breathing treatment. Everything seems to be slowly improving but the headaches are still coming and going. I have a weird feeling of bubbles all over.

                                                Was diagnosed with a DVT 3.5 weeks after vaccination. Started experiencing symptoms of DVT 20 days after the vaccine. Symptoms were not atypical and were almost not checked for DVT at ER.  Started with twinges in my right leg for several days. Then pain in my back right behind my heart. Then developed sporadic chest pain and heart palpitations. I was afraid to go to the ER because of COVID because my 12-year-old daughter has a heart condition.  Then on April 30 mid-day my right thigh began to hurt like a  pulled muscle although I had not injured it or pulled it. I couldn&#39;t walk on my leg the pain was so intense. My family was very worried about a blood clot because of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. That night I had really sharp chest pains and my thigh pain was no better by the next morning. I went to the ER told them my symptoms. After the ER doctor examined me he said he was 99% sure I didn&#39;t have a blood clot because my pain was in my thigh and there was no redness or swelling. He told me my chest pain was probably due to anxiety. I asked if he would check my leg anyway. Once the ultrasound of my leg was done the DR came back and said I had a DVT. Then I had to have an MRI of my chest which he told me was a lot of radiation. I did not have a PE. They did not prescribe Heparin because they felt the DVT was from the vaccine. So I was giving Eliquis. Since then my family DR has run more tests and I do not have any genetic reason to have the DVT. I do not and have not taken birth control in the past 20 years. I am now on a blood thinner for at least 90 days if not longer and I am continuing to have twinges and chest pain twinges.

                                                Had a few cocktails and I blacked out, was highly sensitive to the alcohol. I was throwing up for two hours. I couldn?t move. I couldn?t stop the overwhelming need to vomit. I would try and lay down and was in pain. I ended up telling my partner to call an ambulance after two hours of being in such pain. We were across the street from a hospital so we drove. I was given fluid and blood work was done. I left before receiving the results. I couldn?t stand another minute lying there freezing. The machine that was monitoring me kept beeping quickly. I was able to get home and I slept for 12 hours and woke up feeling achy and was having hot flashes for a few hours.

                                                I noticed it felt like a sinus cold coming on along with face, head and minor toothaches to the my left side of my face on the the 8th or 9th. I took Tylenol everyday for my sore arm and the headaches but it did help suppress them so I didn?t think much of it. My throat also started to feel kind of raw or itchy but I didn?t have a cough and I noticed a slight post nasal drip. Ok the 10th in the evening I felt exhausted and my face and sinuses were much worse. I took cold medicine and fell asleep early but had a hard time sleeping. I?m a side sleeper and if I turned on my left side, my ear felt like it was burning and my face would go numb. It also made me very dizzy. I woke up with body aches and light headed. My throat doesn?t hurt but it feels different. Almost numb like nothing and I can?t smell or taste.

With history of panic attacks we observed closely.  After 25 minutes, and symptoms getting worse, we decided it was best to administer epi-pen and called 911.  Symptoms got a bit better after a minute. After about 7 minutes another epi-pen was administered as symptoms were starting to get worse again.

I immediately got to her, felt her pulse and she was breathing so I lifted her legs. She immediately came to. We gave her ice packs and sat with her until she was able to move on her own accord. She was light headed and nauseated and had a friend take her home.

I experienced strong fatigue over the next couple of days, including sleeping 11 hours on 4/9.   I am still tired today, 4/10.  *Dizziness:  Late in the evening, I was very dizzy for a couple of minutes.  My head felt strange on and off throughout the night. Maybe lightheaded and definitely strange.   *Not able to complete normal daily activities because of:  Nausea, chills and hot spells: These 3 were experienced starting around 11pm.  Each symptom would come and go in waves.   I was miserable and could not sleep for very long.  I took lots of naps the next day.  Also, I was unusually forgetful.  These 3 symptoms (chills, nausea, hot spells), along with the fatigue, were so strong that I was unable to do most of my daily activities on 4/8.   I felt only about 50% functional on 4/9 and I&#39;m mostly OK today.       *Fever: none *Heart rate:  frequently elevated about 20 beats per minute from my baseline

I checked in with her 5 minutes into her wait and she said she was fine. Then she complained she was dizzy. I asked her if she had eaten yet (1230pm) and she said no. I had her sit down and drink some orange juice. She then said she wanted to lay down, so I took her back into the booth and she stretched out over a few chairs and boosted her legs up. She said her hands and arms were getting tingly and she started to panic. I took her phone and dialed her husband who was outside and told him to come in. She asked me to call 911, I did. I applied an ice pack to her forehead neck and shoulder areas and she said she was feeling better. I gave her another juice bottle an verified any meds she was on. She wasnt taking any meds. I called mngt also to take a statement. her husband came in and told her to calm down she was just anxious and didnt eat. When the paramedics finally showed up she was feeling much better. they took her out the the ambulance to check her over. They asked her if she wanted to go to the hospital, and she said no. I will call her later to check in on her.

                                                When I first got the shot I noticed it in my throat. I told the nurses they had me wait 20 minutes before I could leave. I felt dizzy but not dizzy enough to not go home. It felt like it went to my stomach, then my head, and then I could feel it in my joints.  I drove home from the city. Two hours pass, I notice a rash but I didn&#39;t think anything of it due to indoor allergens, springtime plus it went away within an hour.   I started to get chills and fever. I had a lack of sleep due to pain throughout the first night. I was waking up feeling like my head was on fire from my ears to the top of the skull area and in front of my face by my eyes too. My eyes felt like they were going to burst. I layed in bed for 24 hours.   Day two: pain, tiredness, headache, and sensitivity to light for the next few days. Symptoms come and go for days then wean off.   Next, I had issues with anxiety, sleeping, yet being really tired as well coupled with problems sitting still. These are subsiding but still there.  I am still very tired today and a bit anxious on April 13th, 2021. I also notice my typing skills, as well as testing skills, are not as sharp as before the vaccination.

Four days later my lumph nodes in face and neck swelled and I had heart palpitations, abnormal ECG, and excess fluid in lungs. Went to urgent care and doctor recommended to wait it out.  On 4/15/21 symptoms peaked and I began to have severe frothy phlegm, raised blood pressure, and heart palpitation. I went to the ER and was given and was prescribed antibiotics, steroid, and inhaler.

                                                Injection given very high on left shoulder. When injection started?burning pain went through the shoulder and then followed bloodflow down left arm to fingers, back up arm, down left side of back of neck, down the back, down the back of the left leg to foot, and back up to the middle of body before the burning no longer followed a path. Upon standing, I was dizzy, and told the pharmacist, and I told her that something felt wrong. She asked me to wait outside the pharmacy, standing, for 10 minutes. I was shivering and visibly shaking. Immediately after the injection, the burning on the left side persisted for over 30 min, and was over the whole left side of my body.  I could not move my shoulder joint without a lot of pain. The pain has gotten worse each day, around the shoulder.....pain in the rest of my body has lessened.

My throat starts to swell, it?s hard to swallow. I start coughing profusely.  Later that evening came the chills, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea. That lasted 3 days. On day 8 I had severe pain down my arm. The same as the pain I had before I had my cervical spine fusion. On day 11 I had severe down my leg. Again the same type of pain I had before having lumbar spine surgery.  I?m on day 12 as I?m writing this.

Period cycle started early and was very intense cramps, heavy bleeding, vomiting. To date, the headache, dizziness, light headed, brain fog and fatigue are still being experienced 13 days after being vaccinated. I called a nurse line on 4/16/2021 to talk over my side effects and was told to visit an urgent care center, who then sent me to the ER for bloodwork and an MRI of the brain. Was told all results came back normal, to continue to monitor myself and make an appointment with a primary care physician if I feel the same in week.

                                                Hi, I had the Janssen vaccine around noon time. From around before 7pm the same day evening, I started having chills and fever for two hours, I didn&#39;t do anything but just lying there and feeling really cold with a fever. Then around 9pm, the temp went up becoming a high fever and I had a severe &#34;temple ache&#34; for the next 3 hours on both sides. I felt dizzy during those hours. Then around midnight my fever slightly went down but the aches on my temple remained there. For the next 10&#43; hours, I suffered a fever and temple pain.  Until around the early afternoon the next day, I finally felt I was back to 70% normal but still weak.  But I didn&#39;t feel I was fully recovered until around the noon time the following day-- which was about 1.5 to 2 days later after my vaccination.

                                                As soon as I took the vaccine shot I had an immediate headache, after taking the vaccine I took Tylenol and slept in the rest of the day. The next day I woke up and my arm was red and swollen. I was running fever, still had the headache and now blurry vision. My entire body was hurting. My left side of my body felt numb and tingling. The next two days the pain became worse. I did not really have an appetite. When I did eat I could barely hold my food down. On Wednesday morning I could barely get out of bed, I also felt extreme pain in my lower legs, stabbing pain in stomach and right lower side. I also had ringing in my ears, more in the right ear. I then notice a bruise on my left leg, that it was not originally there, and was also tender to touch. I went to the emergency room on the same day and I was admitted. I was in there for 4 days, they tested my leg and stated it was not a blood clot, although it look and felt like one. They discharge me and advise me that it was a migraine that was causing all my pain.  This was on Sunday, I had a follow up with my PCP on the Friday, however to being in so much pain and shortness of breath, and arm pain I was advise to go to the ER on the Thursday and was admitted again. I was told in the ER I had a blood clot in my right arm and it was most likely from the IV from the previous visit. My blood pressure and heart rate was so high that they put me on medication. No matter the pain medication they gave me, it would not completely take the pain away. They discharge me again on Monday and after me begging them to get run any and all test, they said they found nothing. I&#39;m still in the same amount of pain and same symptoms, still having trouble keeping my food down. The only thing that changed is my left arm is not as sore, however I still have a huge knot and its still warm to touch. I don&#39;t know what else to do that is why im contacting the CDC for help. I&#39;m in a extreme amount of pain and pounding headaches.  Please help

She made an appointment for later in the day with her PCP and was promptly sent to the emergency room for further evaluation. X-rays and labs were drawn.

Went to primary who detected a drop in oxygen levels, was then sent to ER where many tests were done.  Included chest scan, to look for clots.  None were found.   Took dramamin for vertigo which helped.  Symptoms of nausea, headache, vertigo continue to persist off and on.  On Friday 4/23 I died my hair.  Within 2 minutes an allergic reaction too place: sudden nausea, some shaking, headache.  Took benedryl which help.  At this point, I have continued bouts of nausea and no appetite.  Its been close to a month and I&#39;m really scared for my health.  I was completely healthy before.

                                                Patient was given the Janssen vaccine and within 3 minutes the pt complained that she was lightheaded and dizzy. As I walked out of the pharmacy to see what her reaction was her muscles tensed up and she became completely rigid and stared sliding out of her chair. By appearances it looked like she was shaving a mild seizure, with a blank stare. By the time I got her down on the floor and got her coat off to see if there was an allergic reaction to the site the patient came too and asked me why she was in the floor. At that time she was clamy but knew who she was and where she was. Paramedics were called and while they were here she stated that she was dizzy and nauseous so they ended up taking her to a location hospital to be seen. While there they drew blood as a precaution.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine, I felt pretty good. Just some soreness in arm and a minor headache an hour later. I took Tylenol and symptoms were bearable the rest of the day. By around 6 or 7p that night, I experienced full body pain and chills, similar to the flu. I also had some chest pain and tightness but attributed that to the overall body pain. I was also very winded and short of breath. I called my Primary Care Doctor to report this, and she said this was a normal reaction and it meant my immune system was working. It continued into the next day, and I took my temperature and had a 102 fever. I slept most of the day and was unable to work. I also had a severe headache. The next day, on Day 3, my flu symptoms were getting better; however, I felt dizzy and short of breath. I also fainted . This is the first time this has ever happened to me. I have never fainted in my life. My symptoms seemed to resolve after eating and drinking, so I figured it may have been dehydration. On Day 4, I was concerned because I was having shortness of breath and chest pain, along with dizziness. I could not take a deep breath without having pain. I called my Primary Care Doctor, and she told me she was concerned I might have covid and to go to the ER. I do not believe I have covid. No one in my household has these symptoms except for me. I believe it is from this vaccine. My chest pain/shortness of breath seemed to go away. for a bit so I did not go to ER. I&#39;m on Day 5 now, and the chest pain/shortness of breath has come back, so I decided  to report this because I do not listed on the list of common side effects for the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I joined a J&amp;J social media group where others are also reporting these symptoms, so I decided to report to Vaers. I also have had night sweats every day since taking the vaccine and my blood pressure is lower since taking the vaccine.

Felt as if I were floating to chair. Sat for 20mins, legs weak, odd sensation across shoulder blades &amp; cervical spine. &#34;Slow&#34; &amp; woozy for duration of evening. Physically moved slow, cognitively slowed down, inability to focus. Internal body-wide sensation difficult to define. All very similar to immediate effects I have from alcohol. Passed out (sleep) 9hrs later &amp; woke 100% fine at 8am.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Approx 7 p.m.,  I noticed moderate pain in my lower back, hips, and legs. Around 7 30, I felt very cold and began covering up with several blankets and turning up the heat. Husband and kids reported the house was not cold at all. Within 15 minutes, chills began and increased quickly to an almost violent state. I was shivering so badly, it became painful and scary. My husband added three blankets on top of our down comforter and sent me to bed. It took approx 15 minutes to warm up, stop shivering, and slow teeth chattering enough to relax and fall asleep. Awoke around 1:30am feeling incredibly thirsty and in desperate need of water. Upon standing, the pain in my body was excruciating which made it extremely difficult to walk. Finally in the kitchen, I took Ibuprofen 800mg and filled a large bottle with water. I began to feel incredibly dizzy and needed help from my husband to get to the couch. It took approximately 2 hours before I began to feel any relief from the ibuprofen. Around 6:30 a.m., about 60 to 65% of the pain had abated and I had finished around 100oz of water. The remainder of the day was spent feeling extreme fatigue and a general sense of unwell. Appetite was poor throughout entire event. This all continued into the evening until bedtime at 11pm. Experienced moderate insomnia overnight, falling asleep around 2:30am. Could not fall asleep due to constantly thinking about the stress of the previous 24&#43; hours. Upon waking this morning, I feel almost back up to 100%.

                                                About 7 hours after the vaccine injection I started to feel flu-like symptoms: aches, chills, woozy and slightly nauseous. Within the next few hours the symptoms became increasingly worse, but not different other than the addition of a headache. I took 2 Tylenol to help with the headache and fever. Overnight sleep was difficult due to chills, sweats, fever dreams and aches. The symptoms lessened the next day (24-hours post injection), but still included muscle/body aches, headache, and extreme fatigue. Again took 2 Tylenol to help. Today (48-hours post injection) I&#39;m feeling quite a bit better although still not 100%. Soreness at injection site persists, especially when lifting my arm.

                                                My symptoms started 12 1/2 after the vaccine.  I had body aches, headache, chills, fever, very dizzy light headed, fatigue. Most of the symptoms lasted for a couple days, by Friday the 12th I was fever free and muscle aches went away. The day after the vaccine I blacked out at school, the nurse took my pulse and blood pressure and everything seemed ok. My husband picked me up and I went home to sleep.  Sunday the 21st for the firs today I made it through the day without sleeping or having any issues.  I did go to the Dr. for a follow  up my heart was a little up and down but still within the normal wrong.  She told me to take a week off.

I had a slight fever and just stayed in bed the day after. Ibuprofen seemed to help the headaches but not the body aches. No nausea. Within 72 hours I was almost back to my normal self, but still extremely tired, and my neck and back hurt quite a bit. Today marks 13 days. As of 5 days ago I began to get cold like symptoms. Neck and back still extremely uncomfortable, neck barely able to move side to side. I have a bit of a cough with phlegm. Headaches are still happening quite a bit, and still super tired all the time. I feel like I?ve been sick ever since I took the shot, and have to take several days off work.

I woke up at about 05:00 am with a fever of 101.6. My heart rate was elevated - racing heart. I took some more Tylenol -and I tried to sleep but it was hard to. After a few hours, I felt achy and sore but better. Three days later, had a run of skipped heart beats (Thursday) and heart palpitations. I called my regular doctor on Monday and on Thursday, I called the Cardiologist. I take a beta blocker when I have bad heart palpitations and they continued to happen but were better with the beta blocker. Within a few hours, on Thursday, the symptoms resolved. I still have heart palpitations but the vaccine may have increased them.

                                                Patient received her vaccine at 11:30 AM.  Immediately after receiving the Jansen vaccine, the patient reported feeling lightheaded as she stood up.  She sat in our waiting area for about 10 minutes, and reported that she felt as though her tongue was swelling.  We contacted EMS at this point, and provided a dose of Benadryl to the patient at her request.  We brought the patient into our vaccine room where she began to break out into hives.  She vomited several times.  EMS arrived shortly thereafter and checked to see if the patient was experiencing an allergic reaction.  EMS took the patient to the hospital.  At about 2 PM, the patient called the pharmacy to let us know that she was okay.  She said that it was confirmed as an allergic reaction at the hospital.  She indicated that she had received a steroid injection at the hospital and was feeling much better.  We encouraged the patient to call us at any time if she had any further problems or questions.

The hearing came back a few hours later but was muffled and echoed in the left ear for about 48 hours following the vaccine.  I tried decongestant medications and tylenol without improvement in the hearing issue.  The left ear has mostly resolved at this time but the ear is popping at times with muffled hearing intermittently.   All other symptoms are resolved.

I drove home and started to feel nausea, a light headache, and mildly dizzy. I started to get short of breath about 45 to 50 minutes after the injection. I climbed a flight of stairs and was completely winded I was having trouble catching my breath. My lymph nodes in my neck swelled up a lot and I was developing a sore throat and small bumps on roof of mouth. I called the nurses line and was directed to take a 50 mcg dose of benadryl and that if the shortness got worse to call 911 and use my epi pen.  After about 2.5 hours the breathing seemed to primarily resolve itself and resume more normally. I woke up this morning with a very sore arm, body aches, a mild headache, congested sinuses, and with a sore throat. I do feel like I am not tasting as well as normal, it could be the congestion. I do not feel great but only seem mildly winded and short of breath walking across the house.

                                                I had a very bad case of Covid in January 2021 and have not regained my taste or smell.  I was in bed for 2 weeks and had a prolonged fever up to 105 degrees--so high that I had visual and auditory hallucinations.  I had hair loss in the following months and I also continue to be fatigued.    I received the vaccination on 4/6/21 around 11am; a slight headache and face flushing occurred about 30 minutes after shot, but generally felt ok.  Woke up at 4am on 4/7/21 with chills, extreme joint pain, body aches, migraine headache, and a fever of 101.5 degrees.  Took Tylenol around 6am and went back to bed.  The migraine headache, chills, body aches, and extreme joint pain continued.  I was dizzy and extremely fatigued.  Woke up around 9 am and fever was at 102.7 degrees.  Joint pain and headache were almost unbearable at this point and I took a hydrocodone.  Took temperature around 12 pm and it was 103.5 degrees.  Fever continued rising to 104.4 degrees at 2:30 pm.  Took another Tylenol and went to sleep.  The next day, my fever had fallen back down to 102.5 degrees.  I continued with Tylenol to control me fever to around 101 degrees.   My fever persisted for 3 days.  I still have extreme fatigue, joint pain, burning scalp (which will likely mean more hair loss), zero appetite and weight loss, dizziness, blurred vision, etc.  The side effects are exactly how i felt when I got Covid in January.

                                                Burning sensation with tingling and some minor numbness within 5 min, within 15 min started to feel dizzy.  spoke with EMT on site and was told I could remain for an additional observation before returning home and that another 5 people had the same symptoms that morning and appeared to be fine after some time.  After I arrived home, on or about  10: 45, I ate an egg sandwich and the dizzy sensation faded. However, severe fatigue set in  and by 1 PM I went to lie down.  On or about 1:30PM, I awoke with severe chills and a fever of 101.5.    The Chills lasted from about until about 3AM on April 9th.  The fever, however, went down after I took Tylenol at about 8PM.  I remained in bed on April 9th until 8AM and proceeded to work from home with fatigue and a headache that would not go away with Advil.  By April 10th the a majority of the initial symptoms abated and only a sore left arm with a slight tingling sensation remained.  On Sunday, April 11th, my right ankle started to swell and left leg had some pain (behind the knee) .   Elevated the leg and the swelling went down on the right ankle and left leg felt better after massage on the 12th.

                                                Thursday 04/08/21 - 1:35 PM Went to Fairgrounds to get the Johnson &amp; Johnson - Janssen COVID-19 vaccine shot with my husband. Both of us wore our masks, walked in together, went through the line together, we both got the shot in our left arms and then set together and waited the 15 minutes before we could leave. A little later at home we were working on some landscape lighting and I felt a bit foggy, light headed and kind of out of it. I was drilling into masonry and the first hole went fine but the second one for some reason just wasn?t going and I touched the drill bit with my fingertip on my left hand to see if it had smoothed out and I knew in my head not to do it and that it should be hot as heck but I didn?t feel anything at all so later that evening when I took a shower my finger was burning and I knew I had burnt it. That evening I begin to feel crippling cold, my fingernail and toenail beds had turned purple and I was shivering violently. I got under a pile of blankets with my dog and  tried to slow my breathing I could feel my heart beating in my chest and it felt like the air I was breathing was cold and frosty. I had a 104&#43; fever that night. My husband got me some aspirin a cold washcloth for my head a popsicle and water to help bring down the fever. And I was able to sleep on and off that night. When I woke up I had a 103&#43; fever and a tingling and numbness in my arms. Before the fever my arms felt tight and cold and I had a tingle that ran from my elbows to my fingertips. Again it was aspirin cold washcloth and lots of water to drink to try and get my fever down.   Friday 04/09/21 Was spent in bed trying to drink water and sleep through it. My arm was sore, not at the injection site but the whole top part of my arm felt like I had been hit by a truck. I had a fever again that evening.   Saturday 04/10/21 I thankfully woke up fever free but my arms were tingling. I had to take my husband to the airport that morning at 6:30 AM. I came back home and went back to bed until about nine when I woke up my arms were cold and sore and tingling it seemed to be getting worse in my left arm and I felt shots of electricity from my elbow down to my fingertips. At one point I took a picture because my left arm hurt so much more than the right and my fingertip beds were purple on my left and pink on my right. I took aspirin and took a nap. I couldn?t hold my phone with both hands hands like normal sitting in bed because my left hand goes cold and achy. Woke up worried that both my arms were aching and tingling from my elbows to my fingertips seems to be where it stays the most. Then that pain subsided and my lip started to tingle. After a few hours that stopped but the tingling in my arms is about constant not as strong sometimes, not in both arms sometimes, it seems to almost always be in my left arm and at one point scary enough that I almost went to the ER. Went to bed around 11:30 PM and the tips of the toes on my left side were tingling and it went to the whole leg.  Sunday 04/12/21 I woke up with a coughing fit  and mucus at around 1:00AM and my right leg with a little tingly at 4:24 AM awake again and coughing woke me had to get a drink and my stomach was buzzing and stopped now just back to the bottom half of my left leg. All of a sudden after a coughing and sneezing fit I got a tremendously sore burning throat out of no where that only lasted about five minutes. I noticed my left arm straining to hold up the pizza box tonight when my right arm had no trouble at all. Then a little later in the day stiffness in the back of my neck. It is a weird strong dry cough and I was scared to go to the ER because my symptoms were so varied and ever-changing I didn?t know what they would do with me and I didn?t want to just get stuck in there for days with him not knowing or making it worse. I told my husband ? It?s so random I?m a little scared no one is going to know what to do with me...?I?ve had issues with allergic reactions and no one being able to diagnose them and me having to figure it out on my own on the Internet that I had Thyroid problems and that I was allergic to the sun for a few years in the past and aloe vera... I didn?t wanna wind up going, them not fixing anything and having a huge bill to pay. But this whole time my body is buzzing and tingling and going through something strange. At this point I am just telling my family I?m okay and what random symptoms I have had since we spoke last. They are on standby to watch my children if I need to go to the ER. The constant buzzing, numbness, cold tingling in my arms is worrisome.   Monday 04/12/21 I am use to the numbness and tingling being a constant thing on some part of my body... There are times when I feel fine but I know it won?t last long. We can add an upset stomach and diarrhea to the list. I had a metal taste in my mouth for a little bit today. Both arms legs and my lips have randomly buzzed, ached or tingled. The websites say call 911 for emergency or call your local medical provider for assistance so I called the local ER to see if they could tell me if my symptoms were normal or if it?s something I should come in for and they couldn?t give me any advice... I was told if you feel like you should come in then come in. I had a very strong sharp pain at my elbow of my right arm tonight that made me sit up in bed...   Tuesday 4/13/21 My left arm is still sore if people touch me or if I try to sleep on my side like I normally do it hurts trying to hold my phone with both hands my arm still goes cold and achy. So far this morning my arms are both tingling and my left leg and my lips so at this point I just say I?m buzzy. 11:25 AM randomly my right arm decided to feel worse for a change but is back to a low buzz... after a few minutes. I find myself holding them up or lifting them when they hurt it seems to help a little to elevate my arms to my chest. I am just waiting to see what comes out in the media, or to see if this gets any better, or if they learn what to do about it... It isnt over, it hasnt stopped yet.

I couldn&#39;t stand so they carried me out of car and took me to Hospital.   The rooms were full so I  was in wheelchair waiting for room, shaking profusely, blue fingers, nauseous, dizzy and couldn&#39;t stand on my own. I was able to go to restroom w/assistance but My muscles were stiffened for 1 hour&#43; and over and i felt awful. over the course of 5 hours I gained strength back and started to feel better with just mild headache and nausea.   They did EKG, blood panel and chest xray which looked ok. Diagnoses as allergic reaction and told me to come back if more issues.

                                                The day of and the first week after I only felt a little lightheaded. Seven days after the vaccine I began having dizzy spells, extreme fatigue and nausea, blurred vision, extreme right head pressure, floaty sensation, numbness and tingling in my right arm and leg, muscle spasms, and extreme anxiety. All things I have never experienced before. And they have persisted daily since they began. My first period one week after the injection was a couple days late and very light and only lasted a few days, which is also not normal roe me. I have short periods of relief and then the symptoms return. It is very scary and I need help. I have been to my pcp several times and the Er. They can?t explain my symptoms.

                                                April 12/Day 1 -  1:35pm : 5 minutes after the shot my throat hurt Afternoon: Felt light-headed, woozy and hard to focus on work.  No fever yet.  8:30pm: Chills so bad I was convulsing and could barely hold anything in my hands.  Got in bed and stayed there.  9:30pm: 102.6 fever  Evening and in the middle of the night: Drank lots of water and coconut water.  Took 2 Tylenol before bed.   April 13/Day 2 -  Morning - took 2 more Tylenol Had fever all day, around 101.8 and going down to 101.3.  Slept all morning.  12:30pm - Got out of bed to try to eat chicken soup and crackers - took 3 bites and felt nauseated, like I would throw up so I got back in bed and went back to sleep.  5pm - Woke up and ate a little dinner.    April 14/Day 3 - Temperature dropped to normal.   April 15 - present:  Didn&#39;t have fever but continued to feel sick and have symptoms:  Day 3-5:  Hard to focus at work.  Someone would call me to talk about something.  Then we started talking about other things and I couldn&#39;t remember why they called in the first place - what was the topic we were talking about.  Felt very tired and had to rest periodically throughout the day, in between work meetings.    Day 6-12: Continued to feel tired and weak.  Have to take at least 1 nap to get through the day.  Brain fog - memory not as good.  Felt sick, like I had a cold (eyes hot and itchy, throat periodically hurt. I don&#39;t normally have allergies.)  Took lots of echinacea, elderberry syrup and Vitamin C.   Day 12 - Present:  Still feel tired all day long except for the first 4 hours after I have coffee in the morning.  Need to take a nap most days.  I don&#39;t feel as healthy as I did prior to taking the shot on April 12.

                                                At 5:30 pm, I started to have a headache, so I took some Tylenol.  I started to feel a little better.  From about 7:00 pm to about midnight, I felt awful.  I couldn&#39;t walk down a short hall without assistance.  I was so sore and achy I couldn&#39;t really sleep.  I felt insanely hot, yet had chills and I had a terrible headache.  I am type 1 diabetic, and my blood sugar spiked to over 200, where it hovered between 200 &amp; 300 most of the night, despite the fact that I used insulin to try and lower it.  From 10 pm to midnight, I felt nauseous.  Overnight was ok.  I still had some of those symptoms, but could sleep off and on.  I probably woke up every couple of hours.  I was till very sore and hot, but not as hot, and still had a headache.  Today, I took Tylenol this morning.  I still have a mild headache, sore body, tired and a little slow, but significantly better than last night.

Patient stated she started feeling nauseous and light headed so asked if she can wait outside for some fresh air. When she went outside, she sat on the edge of the stairs and fell backwards and passed out. The store manager was there to catch her before her head hit the pavement. Patient wasn&#39;t alert for about 2 minutes. Pharmacist came out and assessed the patient and she was communicative. She was in and out but was able to tell us her name, DOB and where she was. We sat her up,  gave her some water, and waited with her. She requested not to call the ambulance. I checked her pulse at 1:15pm and it was 92. I checked her pulse again at 1:30pm and it went down to 72. Patient was fully alert and speaking in full sentences by 1:35pm. She called her mom and was able to stand up without feeling dizzy. She walked to the car with assistance and was driven home by her mother.

                                                Dizziness immediately following vaccine. Slight headache, moderate muscle aches, severe pain at injection site. It was also swollen with redness, itching, and it was hot. . Never had a fever. I immediately started taking Benadryl every 4 hours. I had really bad nausea (no vomiting)  to the point I was unable to eat and lost 7 lbs. I had really bad cold sweats so bad I was drenched with sweat multiple times a day for over a week. I ended up going to the walk in clinic about 5 days after the injection and was given Zofran for nausea.  I was also told I had a moderate allergic reaction to the vaccine and any other time they would start me on steroids but they said if I took steroids it would make the vaccine not work. So I was told to continue Benadryl and deal with it.  To this day which will be two weeks tomorrow since I received the shot I still have a hard hot lump in my arm, I still break out in cold sweats, and still have a little nausea.  Never had wheezing or issues breathing though.

                                                Approximately 13 hours after receiving the vaccine, I woke up in the night with nausea, chills, fever, spinal pain, joint and bone pain, and the worst headache of my life that I could feel in my brain stem and spinal cord. I also experienced confusion and difficulty walking to the bathroom. The headache was not relieved by OTC pain relievers. I had difficulty sleeping and felt restless. I felt the fever ?break? around 5am with profuse sweating. I had to miss work today (I am a nurse myself who was actually working at the clinic when I received my vaccine). It is now 3pm and after taking a sleep aid and sleeping all day, I do feel better, but the headache remains. I had H1N1 about 10 years ago and aside from that, this is probably the sickest I?ve ever been and it is, with certainty, due to the Covid vaccine.

Most symptoms lasted three full days.  One week after the vaccination and I still have confusion, dizziness, and vertigo like symptoms. If I look up or down or side to side too quickly, I feel extremely dizzy and nauseated. I can?t stand for more than about 5 minutes without feeling dizziness and nausea set in, even getting on my bike causes nausea and dizziness, driving, walking, anything related to movement. **Only had one vaccine - the form added a second set of boxes above and won?t let me remove it on this form.

I was terrified because this was something I had never felt before. The symptoms began to fade within 4 hours and then I experienced the &#34;normal&#34; side effects, such as arm pain and tiredness.

                                                Woke up the day after vaccine feeling fine so I got ready &amp; headed for work.  On the way to work I started feeling a little off &amp; nauseous. Ended up leaving work a little over 2 hours after I started.  I was feeling nausea, achy, chills, fatigue, dizziness/lightheaded, sore arm.  Went home and to bed.  Still fatigued, sore arm and a little achy the next day.  Now on day 4 since vaccine and am still experiencing a sore arm &amp; fatigue(improving but not back to my normal energy level).  On a positive note my ongoing sinus symptoms(since June 2020) have improved.  They are not gone but noticeably improved.  I&#39;m thankful for that and hoping it lasts!!!!

                                                Lost appetite for 9 days.  I was not nauseous and food smelled and tasted good but I had no feelings of hunger. I had to set a reminder to eat otherwise I would go hours without food and never once would I feel hungry.    Other events - odd headache that lasted about 24 hours, pain when touching face lasted about 12 hours, &amp; back, neck, shoulder and upper arms all painful like I had been at the gym for three days straight - lasted about 24 hours. Brain fog that lasted about 5 to 6 days. Dizzy spells for about 5 days.

                                                I felt very dizzy about  15 minutes after the vaccine.  The girl next to me that had just had it had a seizure so thought it was nerves at first. That went into pressure in my head, my tongue got numb and started to swell, started coughing up blood. I took prednisone and used my epipen. When I got home I was terrified to go to the hospital. The oral swelling subsided. The head pressure lasted at least 12 hours. My bp was real low (70/45). It did slowly come back up. Cough and chest congestion is still present. Brain fog. Fever lasted about 4 days.  This is the second report I?m putting in. I did not hear back on the last one submitted 4/8

                                                Lightheadedness and exhaustion set in 15-25 minutes post injection. Later that same evening, experienced nausea, muscle, bone, and joint aches as well as chest pain that were much reduced by the following morning. Malaise continued as did symptoms of nausea without vomiting.  24 hours post injection, experienced a low grade fever of 99.6 F (for me, this is a low grade temp). Fever broke after another 24 hours.  Experienced severe headaches in the middle of the forehead for 8-12 hours on 3/25/2021, 3/29/2021, 4/3/2021.  Experienced difficulty breathing 3/30/2021. Woke up from deep sleep feeling starved for oxygen and a sensation that a deep enough breath could not be taken--the lungs could  not expand enough. Respiratory rate seemed slightly depressed. It passed after about 30 minutes with focused effort on taking deep, regular breaths. Fell asleep again and did not consult a medical provider about it. The oxygen hunger / breathing issue did not repeat.  Medical professionals were not consulted for any of the episodes described above.

Pt reported she awoke from sleep late 4/7/21 early 4/8/21 with severe pain in her left leg. She reported it hurt so bad she was &#34;screaming&#34;. She stated it felt like a &#34;charley horse&#34; and her husband noted a knot in her leg. She went to the ER on 4/8/21 due to the inability to put pressure on her leg and/or walk on her leg. She reports having a CT scan of her chest at the ER and no clots were noted. She stated they did not image her leg at that time and scheduled an ultrasound/doppler for around 4/27. She was prescribed some oral blood thinner, but could not recall the name. She stated she stopped the blood thinner on 4/12/21 after the new reports regarding the J &amp; J vaccine and not using blood thinners to treat. Today she states her leg is purple, black and blue and is swelling more when she is up on it at work. RN instructed pt to call her primary provider regarding stopping the blood thinner and to see if re-evaluation of her leg is needed. Pt also instructed to seek emergency treatment for increased swelling or pain to her leg, headache, abdominal pain, shortness of breath or any other concerns. Pt plans to speak with or see her primary provider today.

The night was miserable with fever, chills and dizziness when walking to the bathroom.  The next day low grade fever and chills that began to subside around 24 hours post vaccination.  For the next 48 hours had residual aches and fatigue.  Began feeling significantly better after the 72 hour mark.  However, after learning about blood clot issue has been having anxiety and some left sided pain that I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s anxiety or migraine related or possibly something worse.

                                                Patient reports: &#34;I received my covid 19 vaccine on Friday April 9th (J&amp;J) and need to report my reactions afterward. Had the usual immediate arm pain after injection along with nausea. Took a Benadryl and napped when got home and woke up 6 hours after injection with a tingling and swollen lower lip and constricted breathing. Took 3 Benadryl in fear of going to hospital and waited it out. Once lip went back to normal as well as breathing went to bed since it was late and slept all day Saturday. Woke up Sunday in agony from lower back pain and tailbone. Now, thurs 4/15 still in extreme pain in my tailbone. Went twice to chiropractor to help and nothing is alleviating the pain and have been practically bed ridden since Sunday. Can?t work, can?t sit, can?t walk can?t stand can?t anything without extreme pain. Been taking ibuprofen everyday and not helping.&#34;   She had a visit with us on 4/15/2021: &#34;Patient here for extreme pain on her tailbone. She had the Johnson and Johnson vaccine about 6 days ago and about 6 hours later she woke up with a tingling and swollen lip, constricted breathing, and dizziness. She wanted to avoid the hospital, so she took benadryl 75 mg and it slowly resolved her symptoms. These symptoms have not returned since. She was finally able to fall asleep that night and then slept all day the next day. The following day she woke up and experienced extreme pain in her lower back and tailbone. She saw her chiropractor twice this past week, which helped to resolve her low back pain. Per patient her chiropractor noted that her back seemed very inflamed. However, she is still having extreme pain with her tailbone and is unable to sit, stand, bend or work for more than 20 minutes without extreme pain. The only thing that seems to improve her pain is laying on her back with several pillows tucked behind and all around her. However, she is only able to stay in this position for a period of time before her body becomes stiff from immobility. She has been taking ibuprofen 600 mg TID, flexeril PRN, icing and applying moist heat to her back, but none of these measures seem to improve her pain. Lastly she has noticed that when she sits/stands for too long, her buttocks start to spasm. Denies fever, chills, n/v, numbness, tingling, incontinence or loss of bowel/bladder function.&#34;

                                                On 4/10 I got the J&amp;J shot at Medical Center at 8am.  12 hours later at 8pm I experienced the normal side effects - body aches, tired, arm pain.  I slept it off and the next day felt better - took a nap, but no problems.  8 days later on Sunday (4/18) I started to get a headache, on the top of my head (where a hat would go) and the back of my head.  It was on / off, but it&#39;s out of character as I don&#39;t normally get headaches.  On Monday, it continued on/off so I wrote my doctor...on Tuesday it continued more &#34;on&#34; then off - she recommended I go get bloodwork for low platelets and I did (at medical center). They came back normal.   On Wednesday (4/21), the headache became a migrane and was screaming at me - all day with no relief.  I&#39;ve never had a migrane in my life and needed to be in low light - screen time became hard to deal with.  I did get a Covid Test to rule out that and it came back negative Thursday morning.  Thursday morning - same....screaming headache.    Friday, less screaming but still not great - I met with my doctor on telehealth and she recommended I go to the ER to get evaluated.   I went to another hospital on Friday afternoon to get evaluated.   Since my bloodwork from Tuesday was all clear - they believe the migrane was inflammation from my immune response to the vaccine - especially because i never had a migrane before.  They gave me anti-inflammatory meds via IV to mellow out the pain.  They said if the pain came back or if I had other symptoms in the coming week to check back and likely need imaging.    Today is Saturday (4/24) - the anti-inflammatory meds have helped but not 100%.  I do still have some throb on/off and had a few dizzy feelings earlier.

I have lost time at work. The money this is going to cost me out of pocket for ER visits. Wasting peoples time.  I meditate have good people in my life, I?ve never had this typ of panic and feeling and legit arrhythmia. On beta blocker. Told to schedule a cardiologist visit.  Prob gonna need some anti anxiety meds.  There is no help out there for this. Thought doing the right thing to get vaccine.  I?m not antivax but this is super upsetting.  I?m an otherwise normal healthy social person. I cannot even go to friend house b/c of dizziness racing heart and panic

                                                Vaccine administered 10:15am.  Got a headache and mild nausea 12:15pm (2 hours later).  5:15pm (7 hours later) started to shake violently.  Couldn&#39;t walk was shaking so much.  Speaking was difficult.  Breath was labored.  It was so scary my husband called the doctor.  Shook violently with teeth chattering for 45 minutes then would break for a few minutes before shaking again.  The shaking was probably 60 minutes total.  Then fever set in.  Fever hit 102.4 at 6:15pm.  102.9 at 6:40pm.  103.8 at 8:15pm.  Fever ranged between 102.3 and 103.8 for 8 hours after starting then finally broke 1:45am (8 1/2 hours after the shaking started).  Was able to get out of bed 8:00am today.  Massive headache for the morning but no fever today.  26 1/2 hours post vaccine new and I just feel very tired and drained.

                                                At 11pm I started feeling chills and was having cold sweats. Around 1 am I went to  the next room to check my temperature and almost fainted. I sat on the floor and started vomiting. I kept gagging nonstop for several minutes. During that time I urinated on myself, I felt strong stomach aches, headache, and my body felt extremely fatigued.  I was dizzy and sweating. All these symptoms came back again a few minutes later. I do not remember how long everything lasted. I woke up the next day with a slightly upset stomach and headache.

                                                Around 7 pm on 3/13, I developed brain fog, trouble walking, and then fever, severe muscle pain worse in legs, and chills.  Most of these symptoms seemed to improve on 3/14, but then on 3/15, I developed new onset of shortness of breath and chest discomfort.  On 3/16 around 1 pm the shortness of breath worsened and I went to the emergency room.  I felt that I couldn&#39;t take a deep breath in and I had chest discomfort on the left side of my chest worse when taking a deep breath.  My legs were hurting as well, especially my left leg.  I had sinus tachycardia (heart rate 106-120) and increased respiratory rate (rate of 20)  with O2 sats 100% on room air.   My breathing and heart rate improved somewhat with 1 liter oxygen therapy, 1 liter of IV fluids, albuterol inhaler, and decadron 6 mg orally.  It was thought that I had a delayed asthmatic/allergic reaction to the vaccine.  I do not have a history of asthma.  I was prescribed a Medrol dose pack and albuterol inhaler.  My hands and feet are very cold and tingling on 3/18.  Shortness of breath and chest pain seems to have improved but not completely gone as of the time of this submission on 3/18.

                                                As soon as the shot was administered in the deltoid muscle within 3 seconds my axillary node was on fire and I couldn&#39;t put my arm at rest.  Extremely painful in my armpit.  The injection nurse said that is not normal and gave me a sheet to report to the CDC scan code.  My entire left arm was on fire within a minute.  She had me sit for 30 minutes.  I had no other reaction.  My arm was subsiding a little bit to toleration.  I went home and rested, drank a ton of water.  I went to bed and woke up at 2 am in a cold sweat, I felt like I was freezing and could not stop shaking.  My teeth chattered.  My husband put on many blankets and helped me get warm.  He said I was burning up.  My muscles were so weak and painful, joints hurt and extreme head ache.  I took some Advil and he warmed me up.  My left arm was numb up my left side of my neck and my left cheek.  I took the day off work.  In addition, in the morning I felt like my left leg and foot had minor numbness and prickles.  I could walk but it was colder and prickled on the foot each step.  The next day I was 50% better and made it to work barely.  It took me 3 days to recover from the flu like symptoms.   My left arm continued to feel numb and had bouts of prickles and tingling.  The muscles were hard to use in my left arm and I really didn&#39;t use it at all.  Over the course of 2 weeks things have improved.  I still have not recovered feeling in my left pinky and ring finger.  They are weaker still today.  Every morning my left arm is numb for a little while (I don&#39;t sleep on my left side) but recovers to about 75% except my pinky and ring finger.  My left neck and cheek have a warming prickle feeling every morning for about a half hour.  They mostly wake up to entirety.  My L foot at the bottom has period/episodic prickles.   Daily my left arm is colder and is weaker than before.  I am a high school teacher so I don&#39;t have to use my left arm very much but it is causing pain and negative sensations and is reducing the amount of use of my left arm.

                                                Immediately after getting the vaccine I began to feel very strange with symptoms of light-headedness, dizziness, and lethargy. Around 3-4 hours later is when the real symptoms began. First, an extremely rapid heartbeat. My left arm began to feel numb. And I was seized by an episode of extraordinary fatigue. 6 hours after the shot, I was having muscle and joint pain to the point that I felt like I was being stabbed with knives - particularly in my tailbone, ankles, and shoulders. High fever followed, uncontrollable chills and shivering, intestinal pain, diarrhea, and intestinal cramps. The following day I had a headache and continuing extreme fatigue as well as pain in both arms.

                                                On 3/23, I received the vaccine. Within a few hours, my right elbow began to hurt and swell. On 3/24, I could not move my arm due to inflammation and intense pain. The skin was hot to touch. I also had a high fever and severe headache. (The fever broke within 24 hours and the headache lingered for about 48 hours.) On 3/25, the arm swelling started to decrease but was still intensely painful, red, and hot. I treated the arm with ice packs, Advil, and Bio-freeze. On 3/25, I also contacted my PCP by email with my concerns and progression photos of my arm. Another doc responded by having his nurse call me. They denied the reaction could be vaccine related. The nurse insisted on their diagnosis and that I should take antibiotics for a skin infection. I disagree because my symptoms did not match their explanation. On 3/31, I contacted my rheumatologist (due to the inflammation) and they referred me back to my PCP. I am filing this report b/c I believe this was related to the vaccine. Lesser symptoms remain.

                                                Immediate dizziness and nausea. Became tachycardic within an hour. This is still an issue 3 weeks out. Day after vaccine I felt mild flu symptoms all day and was struck with a severe chest pain and intense nausea in the afternoon. I went to the hospital emergency room and had multiple tests run. No cause was found for the chest pain. It began in the center of my chest and moved to the right side of my back.  I have been dizzy, nauseous and extremely fatigued as well as a headache for the last three weeks. The doctor didn&#39;t know what caused the pain. He checked me for a pulmonary embolism  because my clotting factors were slightly elevated.  They have not been rechecked,  though I requested my doctor have them and my platelets rechecked. I still do not feel well. My brain is foggy, my vision gets blurry at times, and I still have the dizziness,  fatigue and nausea. I am no longer achy and I have not had another chest pain like the one I had on the 26th.

I called the neighbor for help. I couldn&#39;t communicate, my body was shaking, trembling, I stuttered as I was trying to form words. I was taken to hospital by ambulance. I was unable to speak, I was shaking and my blood pressure went up and down. I was given IV fluids and Ativan for anxiety, dysarthria and altered mental state.  As of 04/14 I have memory loss, loss of taste and appetite, extreme fatigue

                                                Around 06:00 pm, which was about 9 hours after having received the J&amp;J vaccine, I began having a slight fever and chills.  The most pain I had was in the back of my legs.  Both of my calves felt as if they had both been kicked and were badly bruised.  It was painful to walk for about 48 hours/2 days (Sunday - Monday).  That was the first time in my life that I had that kind of pain in my back calves.  Never had before from running or walking.  Then around 09:00 pm on Tuesday, a reddish dot appeared on the left side of my cheek.  I thought it was just a big zit.  But the following day, the dot got bigger, and looked like a scratch.  On Wednesday, it was definitely a scratch-like shape (2 lines, less than an inch long) and had begun to feel itchy.  That was when I had realized that it had the same pus-like dotted features of a cold sore.  But oddly, it&#39;s not right next to either side of my lips.  Instead, it is further down, towards the left side of my chin.  It is very rare for me to get cold sores.  I can&#39;t remember when my last one was, as it was years ago.  So I am wondering if this cold sore is due to having received the vaccine.  The fever, chills, and leg pain have not returned after those first 2 days.

She contacted her doctor on 3/25 and he thought maybe she had an inner ear infection.  Symptoms continued to worsen and eventually an ambulance was called on 3/27 because patient stated she was having severe SOB and headache along with dizziness and fever.  Patient was transported to Hospital where they tested her for covid and pneumonia.  Both came back negative.  After several tests it was confirmed she had a blood clot in her lung and was also told she had clots in her leg and heart as well.  She was in the hospital for 3 days where she was given heparin and several medications for the headache.  Patient was discharged on lovenox and coumadin and eventually switched to xarelto by pcp who is managing her anticoagulation.  She still has follow up appointments with a cardiologist and neurologist.  She said she is still experiencing some dizziness and SOB but overall doing better

That night she started feeling fatigued, developed a headache, had some body aches and chills that lasted through the following day, then symptoms resolved.  One week later on 4/14 she developed severe bilateral joint pain, specifically in bilateral shoulders, elbows, and knees- to the point where she could barely walk. She was also very fatigued and had chills. This lasted through the following day and started to subside, but then noticed small, papular lesions scattered across chest and arms. The lesions are itchy, small- 1-2 mm, and follow no particular pattern.  She states that today her symptoms have overall improved other than the small itchy bumps. Denies any headache, abdominal pain, joint pain, fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, or redness/swelling of extremities.

                                                Approximately  2 hours after the vaccination I felt very minor side effects (headache / soreness on injection site). The next morning I felt the more intense side effects (fever of 101.1, chills, fever,  extreme sweat, loss of appetite, body aches and fatigue).  While the majority of the side effects have passed I still have no appetite.  I am a very healthy adult that does strength training  4x a week, I typically eat and snack every 3 hours.  Since the vaccination day I have no desire to eat and I am down to 2 meals (breakfast and dinner). I am also experiencing headaches and dizziness but this could be from the lack of nutrients.  Because I feel dizzy I am forcing myself to eat as I almost fainted during a morning workout and had shortness of breath. This particular morning I had coffee, a protein shake and a banana prior to my workout.  I have not read or seen any additional information on the loss of appetite lasting this long and I am getting concerned

I was so severly sick, in bed and couldnt hardly move.  On Sat I was being transported  to the hospital when I got super nauseaed so my husband pulled over and I passed out and went unconscious and fell out the car onto the ground.  EMT was called and transported me to the hospital when a CT Scan and EKG was performed. I was given IV fluids, monitored and released after some time.  Over the next few days I felt absolutely awful.  On 4/15 I had a phone F/U visit with my PCP.  I still havent felt to myself to date and had to go back to the ER last night because I was so nauseaed and dizzy I couldnt stand or do anything and I am still having the diarreah also

These symptoms persisted and my doctor advised me to go to the ER for brain imaging 24 hours after the vaccine. On day 3 after the vaccine, my symptoms had diminished but not subsided and I began to have new symptoms: extreme heat and pressure starting at my right ear and spreading through my face and head. The heat has subsided but not the pressure, as I am writing this it is day 13. Tests came back normal, but weakness and pressure neurological symptoms persist.

I had, in this order, compounded, with the peak happening about 12 hours afterwards: immediate dizziness about 10 minutes after the shot, nausea started about 30 min, at 4 hours a strong headache that didn?t go away until now, took Tylenol at 7pm, stiffness in the joints, hands, and feet started about 6 hours of shot, at 8 hours pain in the shoulders and neck, at 12 hours cramping all down my back and my hips and low fever. Fever continued until around 6am despite taking more tilt at 2am. Finally got to sleep at 6am. Woke with remaining stiffness and headache at 7:30am. Nausea continued for another 6 hours. Headache continued for another 6 hours. Muscles remained sore due to severe cramping last night.

I exercised on Thursday morning because I felt better (stand up paddling). Then the rest of the day, I was very tired and then Friday and Saturday and Sunday, I was very dizzy, foggy, fatigued, no mental clarity, difficult to hold a conversation and answer questions, no focus. Today, Monday, I still feel like I have a brain fog and am talking very slowly. No focus. Conversations feel tiring.

The rest of the day I had the normal symptoms- Pounding headache, nausea, horrible body aches (couldn?t lay down or stand to be comfortable).  That night around 11:45pm I got up to let my dog in and I started seeing small black dots- blurry vision.  I felt nauseas.  I ended up falling on the floor.  I was able to get up.  I then ended up waking up in the bathroom on the floor and had no idea how I had gotten there.  My hands were vibrating.  I called my husband from work to come help me up.  I was able to sleep and didn?t seek medical attention.  I am not sure if it was low blood pressure or what could have happened I have never experienced that before.  I did contact my doctor?s office this afternoon via (online) but haven?t had a response yet.  I have been in bed all day today.  - Body aches, nausea, pounding headache

Patient was unconscious for roughly 15 seconds. We checked pulse and positioned on the floor. Once responsive patient said she was feeling okay. She said she faints when she gets anxious (this was not disclosed before vaccine was given). She spoke with EMS who determined she did not need immediate care. She waited another roughly 30 minutes and was able to leave the pharmacy.

                                                9pm - 7 hours after receiving the shot I was extremely itchy all over and took Benadryl  2am- I woke up unable to move my arms, hands, legs, and feet. I wasn?t able to wake my husband and remained as calm as possible. I drifted in and out of sleep. By 4am I was able to wake my husband. He used our elevating bed to sit me up and gave me ibuprofen and water through a straw (not sure why that was his solution and just thankful I?m here today to type this response). By 6am I had terrible shooting pains in my hands, fingers and then Charlie horses in my feet and calves. That is when the ability to move came back. At that point I was extremely fatigued and exhausted and felt like I had a terrible flu. I was in bed for the next 6 hours clammy and  sweaty and in a very achy.  24 hours after the vaccine I was back on my feet.  50 some hours after the vaccine I still have an aching in my hip on my left side and tenderness at the injection site.

                                                Event took place at an off-site event, in a detention facility. Pt received Janssen COVID vaccine around 4:00 pm. Pt immediately reported nausea. Nurse accompanied pt to the restroom about 2 minutes after receiving vaccine, where she gagged into the sink and spit up a little clear fluid. Pt reported feeling hot and sat down in a chair available in the restroom. Pt and nurse joined by a second nurse. Shortly after sitting down pt complained of feeling dizzy and was moved to the floor to lay down. When laying down, pt appeared flushed under her chin and complained of chest tightness. She requested to sit up to help with breathing. Called 911 and first dose of epinephrine (0.5 mL of 1mg/1mL) administered, both at 4:10 pm. Pt reported no change in chest tightness following epi, but continued to respond to questions. She said she felt tired and wanted to go to sleep. Pt continued to report difficulty breathing, and another dose of epinephrine administered at 4:15 pm. A physician at GEO arrived and administered oxygen. He listened to pt&#39;s heart and lungs and reported that there was air movement in her lungs. Pt ceased to respond coherently to questions, slurring and moaning, but did not lose consciousness. Pt started tapping her lips and, upon questioning, said they felt numb. Third dose of epinephrine administered at 4:20 pm. Nurse continued to jostle patient and ask her questions, and patient continued to respond with short, slurred answers. EMS arrived at 4:23 pm and transported patient to the hospital.

I walked down my hall and saw black dots and felt dizzy with nausea.  The next thing I knew I was on the bathroom floor and didn?t remember how I had gotten there.  It is Friday and I now am experiencing shooting pains in the side of my head.  I also have been experiencing pains in my calf muscles and some chest pains.  I am still extremely tired and having abdominal pain.  I have contacted my doctor?s office about the fainting but I am going to call Monday to get an appointment to get checked out.  I am concerned about possible blood clots.

That mostly resolved after 2 days.  Then 1 week later on Saturday, I started having pain in my left leg where I had had RFA of the greater saphenous vein 6 months prior.  Leg swelled up got a hard knot.  I got dizzy &amp; nauseated.  The pain increased, &amp; I went to the ER on 3/21.  They diagnosed it as thrombophlebitis.  The pain &amp; inflammation  has continued  for 3 weeks now despite the use of anti-inflammatory meds &amp; support hose.  I have also had rapid weight gain of 12 lbs and edema not relieved by lasix.  Two weeks after the shot I also started having severe nose bleeds.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine  On 4/12 I started having a lot of pain overnight, especially the left side of my body. My left hip is hurting really bad, my left arm sometimes hurts. My back is also now hurting. Nothing I take alleviates the pain, I have tried Aleve, Tylenol and Ibuprofen. I am extremely fatigued both day and night now. My bones feel very painful even sometimes down to my feet. While most of my body hurts, the left side seems to hurt more than my right side. When I got the vaccine I felt very &#34;out of body&#34; if that makes any sense, but now I feel very off. I also seem to be bruising easier than I used to before as well.

                                                I received the vaccine at approx 930 am, Wed, March 17 (Johnson and Johnson Lot 1805020) at the Facility by Fireman(Emergency Responders). Vaccine was from Health Care. At first, after about 15 minutes I was feeling a little flush, there were light red splotches on my skin (only a couple, very light red - like when i get really nervous and get red splotches on my neck.) I felt a little nauseous and dizzy off an on for about an hour (but i had not had anything to eat or drink yet that day either). The site of the shot was a little sore and warm about an inch or two away from the needle injection site, but not a big deal. That night my right arm (which is where i received the shot) ached terribly, all the way from my shoulder to my fingers. The next day (Thursday, March 18) was the same. Sometimes my left arm tingled like it was starting to fall asleep. This went on the whole next day. Injection site still sore too, and warm.  The day after that (Friday, March 19) the injection site was sore (like a sore muscle) and that was it. Saturday, March 20, the same until about midnight. Around midnight my son, and I came upstairs from watching tv and my arm (at my wrist) was aching intensly! I looked down and there was a small lump where one if the veins are. I can see my veins easily here and I am very light-skinned. Son could also see the lump. My arm kept aching so badly! I was messaging the lump over and over. After about 5-10 minutes it went down a little bit, ached a little less, and i left it alone. The next day it looked like i had a bruise on my wrist and hand (where the meaty part of your hand is  going to the thumb. The next day, Sunday, March 20th, a neighbor said it could be a blood clot and i took an aspirin.    Today, Wednesday, April 14, 2021.   Approx 1130am, after getting out of bed, getting some coffee. I was sitting at my desk in my home office, took my medication and took my first sip of coffee. All of a sudden, my chest starting hurting. I cant say where the pain originated, it was in the chest/upper stomach area. It ached a lot, I felt very flush, I honestly cant remember if it were hard to breath, all i could think is &#34;what is this?&#34;. I didn&#39;t know if i would throw up, burp, pass out. the aches starting migrating, still saying in the chest, but expanding to my lower back. I got out of my chair and tried to move around...it took a good 3-5 minutes before it started to dissipate and I took another aspirin.

                                                Approximately 30 minutes after the injection I developed a significant headache and nausea.    Approximately one hour later if I was in the sun I became overheated, flush and an overall feeling of nervousness,  I adapted to these symptoms knowing they would considered normal but I no longer feel these should be considered normal.  Around 7pm on Monday I started running a fever that started at 101.1.  Between Monday night and Thursday morning it bounced around but stayed between 101.1 and 103.2.  It did not go away completely until Thursday morning.  At least I hope it is gone for good.  On Wednesday around 10am I developed abdominal pain that by 4pm had me sitting by my car unable to continue for about 10 minutes.  It was extremely stressful and still to the time of this report is still has not completely gone away.  The most concerning for me is the back pain with it.  At the time of this report I still have a headache, nausea, abdominal pain with back pain and vertigo.  I have contacted my doctor&#39;s office and they have made notes but suggested I report everything here.  They have started me on baby aspirin and electrolytes as I am also experiencing interment diarrhea.

Then I got the chills and bundled up. And then the body aches started really bad. I could barely walk to the bathroom. I went to bed. The next morning I called in to work and stayed in bed all day. I could barely wake long enough to go to the bathroom and still body aches bad. I slept till about 8pm. When I ate and went back to bed.

                                                The first side effect I noticed was hives on the arm of the injection site as well as the arm being painful. I became light headed and very tired after the first hour of getting the vaccine. As the evening progressed I begin to get chills and a fever. My body ached from head to toe. I was nauseous and achy all over.  I was feeling sick for the next 24 hours, I stayed in bed and could barley move because my body ached so bad. I had a extreme head ache as well.  By the 3rd day I felt much better and only had pain in the arm of the injection site. After day 10 I noticed a lump near my collar bone and assumed based on web searching that it may be a swollen lymph node.  It&#39;s day 12 and I still have a little tenderness near the injection site and my lymph node is still swollen.

I was very nauseaus, had a fast all over body drenching sweat, dizzy and numbing in fingers/toes (can&#39;t remember which but had tingling and was dizzy).  Rest of day was low fever, headache and tired.  Right arm was sore where couldn&#39;t lift it but that subsided after 2-3 days. Just wanted to report the fainting that almost occured the next early AM.

                                                Severe R shoulder/arm pain since injection.  Upon receiveing the injection I experienced severe pain in my R shoulder joint, but the nurse told me that was normal.  Over the following hours/days/weeks the pain began to radiate up my neck, down my arm and into my scapula and lat areas.  My range of motion (ROM) had become severely limited and I began to experience neuropathies in my right arm and hand.  I tried all OTC pain relievers which had absolutely no effect.  On April 6th, I was in so much pain that I went to an urgent care clinic.  They provided me with prednisone, soma and celebrex (upon completion of steroid).  In addition, I started myself on gabapentin which was provided in the past.  I have one more day of celebrex remaining.   While my symptoms are not nearly as bad as they were, they have not resolved.  I continue to have pain in/around my R shoulder, neuropathy in my R arm and limited ROM/weakness cross-body and above 90 degrees.

                                                Not too many adverse symptoms the day of and after vaccine... tired at times and sensitivity to light but continued to eat and helped w energy.   Also, warm left side of neck and slight red rash.  Not expecting to have leg pain in my calf 6 days later then moved to quad muscle and entire left leg felt achy.  CDC at this point said to check out any leg pain.  Pain was not severe but bothersome... had STAT ultra sound at ER on day 7, turned out negative for blood clots.  Returned to my physicians office day 8... still not feeling right with more of a rash on left side of neck and warm to the touch. Tired and slightly light headed and slight pain in left upper chest.  Digestion not the best starting day 5 thru 10.  Blood test returned normal for platelet levels but low eosinophils... either allergies or body is fighting the vaccine and creating antibodies (most likely).  No known allergies besides maybe skin reaction to Timothy Bluegrass.  Moderate headache day 9 and 10 which made me more fatigued (pain on both sides of head above ears and temples)... normally I do not get headaches.  Also, loss of appetite or feeling slight nauseous on day 8, 9, and 10 after the vaccine.   Now on day 11 and 12.. feeling better but still not quite right.  Lightheaded and feeling fullness in head but more energy than day 9 and 10 by far.  Never heard of people having symptoms after day 1 or 2 of the vaccine, so obviously I think this should be more documented for patients especially after blood clotting as a possibility 6 days after the vaccine.

Feeling of heaviness and weakness to arms and legs.  Chest heaviness and increased work of breathing.  I wasn?t breathing faster, but I was aware of the fact that I had to work harder to breath.  As I said, these symptoms occurred over three days.  The Friday I went to the ED at Hospital.  I arrived around 14:45 and I think it was somewhere around 20:30 when I left.

I was sweating and vomiting.  My husband carried me to the car and brought me to the ER. At the Er I was given a patch for my back pain, medicine for the dizziness and nausea. The dizziness didn&#39;t subside. I couldn&#39;t walk. I told them I had gotten the vaccine two weeks before and they said it wasn&#39;t related. I was diagnosed with a bladder infection, high blood sugar, and vertigo. I was discharged in the evening but with no improvement.  I was not able to focus or walk for days. I saw my OBGYN, he was the only doctor I could see right away and he referred me to an ENT. The ENT can&#39;t see me until the end of June.  I wasn&#39;t able to drive for weeks. I am slowly regaining my balance but still feel waves of dizziness and my eyes can&#39;t focus well when I am reading. The back pain is gone. My OBGYN also doesn&#39;t feel the dizziness is related.

After that I felt like I was coming out of the grips of an experience and felt exhausted by it.

                                                The day after the vaccine my left arm hurt, and I thought it was normal. After two days I was in a lot of pain and I couldn&#39;t lift my arm up. I have to lay on the other side at nights because it hurts. It is constant pain and Motrin does not help the pain. It is still painful at the end of the day after three weeks.  I went to the ER and they thought that it was nerve damage from the vaccine administration. I was given Steroids which helped a little at first but then the pain returned. It was only a three day course because I am Diabetic and it effects my blood sugar. I can raise my arm a little now but not above my head.  Three weeks after the vaccine my right ear started to ring and it was very intense and I couldn&#39;t hear for about four hours. I went to the ER and all the tests were negative. The ringing in my ears is still coming and going. It is very sensitive to sound and it is hard for me to hear. If there is any loud noise the ringing becomes very uncomfortable. It feels like I need to pop my ear all the time. I was told it might be related to the vaccine. I have never experienced anything like this before.

Overnight I was unable to sleep. About 5a.m.  I was incredibly nauseous. I was incredibly weak. I didn&#39;t have the strength to stand or sit upright.  I sat on the bathroom floor &amp; had to have someone prop me up in front of the commode to vomit into it I was so weak. I repeatedly vomited forcefully for about an hour with accompanying repeated bowel movements. I had a fever.I broke out in a sweat repeatedly - clammy. The most painful part as SEVERE, SHARP NON-STOP ABDOMINAL CRAMPING. I was in the fetal position on the floor writhing in pain after the vomiting &amp; bowel movements slowed. After hours of this... my clamminess turned into chills with my entire body shaking strongly &amp; continuously as I lay on the floor unable to do anything but shiver. I considered going to the emergency room but was able to move in my current state. Who &amp; where should I report this severe adverse event?  Note:  I&#39;m a 45-year old VERY physically fit athletic female.   My only health condition:  I take Enbrel for Rheumatoid Arthritis.

I could hardly move and felt an ache in all my muscles and bones.  It was very intense pain.  The entire next day I had severe body pain and severe fatigue.  I tried to go for a short walk and felt dizzy.  Everything hurt.  I took Tylenol regularly all day and mostly slept.  48 hours later I was feeling better.  Slowly regaining stamina and pain is now diminising.

Fingertips still feel like electricity is running through them and fingers/hands still hurt; extremely hungry/thirsty from 03/25/2021 - 03/29/2021; fatigue, pain at base of skull under ears, tinnitus extremely loud and both ears feel like ear ache; During the night of my high fever, lower back where kidneys are started hurting very badly.  What is still left of that pain on day 5 is a pain radiating from my lower back down my right leg many times throughout the day (treating with ibuphrophen).   Pain around knees, elbows, ankles, and bottom of feet- different than joint pain.  All my POTS symptoms are in high gear (tachycardias, very low BP,  pain, dizzy, vertigo).    If the leg/lower back pain, and left arm problems continue, I will see my neurologist or immunologist.  I have reached out to both to make them aware.  My husband had the JJ shot same day, same place and had zero side affects.

                                                I was directed to my seat (if walking into the room, the first table but the 2nd seat).  The woman was learning the computer system from a gentleman, and she assured me she just didn&#39;t know the computer, but knew how to give a shot.  I pulled my arm out of my sweatshirt and pushed my short sleeve shirt up.  She did the alcohol wipe, then pinched my arm, I looked away as the shot went in.  I felt a horrible pain...not even sure how to describe it, just extreme pain and very achy and said Ow maybe 3 times (I am one that can tolerate quite a bit of pain, and I assumed it would sting, but this was different) as she was injecting me.  She apologized. The gentleman said Johnson and Johnson is a little thicker.  I said to him that I had never ever experienced this much pain with a vaccine before-never.  Again, I am talking about as it was injected. I went to sit down for the waiting area, the gentleman who was handing out cards for reviews asked me about it and I said it hurt so bad, I&#39;d never had a shot hurt that bad.  Another worker (female) overheard me and asked me if it was a burning-she had a burning with hers (think she said moderna). I said I would not necessarily say it was a burning, it was pain. As I sat there, I texted my husband and told him how bad it hurt (with the injection) and I&#39;ve never had a vaccine hurt like that.  I started to wonder if it was administered incorrectly? I looked over and the gentleman was now doing the vaccines and she was watching. My husband had Pfizer and he said that didn&#39;t hurt at all. I was feeling it up into my neck as I was sitting there. I was trying to rub my arm and neck hoping that would help as well as move my arm around. When we could leave, I asked the volunteer if she had heard of anyone else having that much pain DURING the shot.  She said she only heard of maybe one other person that said ow. I left, started to cry in the car because of the pain and experience, then spoke with my husband before I left. I came home and got some ice to put on my arm hoping that would help. I did expect pain in the arm after a shot. Within a couple of hours, I noticed pain going down my arm and into my wrist. I thought maybe I needed to be active with my arm and move it so tried that.  I started to notice more side effects of the vaccine as the evening progressed:  I had the typical side effects I figured I&#39;d have, achy, joint pain, chills, nauseous, no fever though. I was noticing pain into my neck (occasionally even into jaw), shoulder, scapula area of the back, and left side under the bottom part of my ribs.  I was feeling tightness in my chest, too, so I decided to try 2 aspirin to see if it helped with any symptoms. I did have slight dizziness, and a weird sensation in my head-like a zapping? I didn&#39;t sleep well, and had to stay completely off of my left side. Thursday, I felt better than that night, but still tired, achy, nauseous, chills, and not 100%.  My arm still was really affected...it seemed extremely fatigued as well as painful...the pain was radiating up and down and couldn&#39;t raise my arm without it hurting. Around noon I decided to take 2 aleve to see if that would help me at all. It did help with the pain and achiness, but was getting a &#34;nerve-type&#34; pain still up and down my left arm into neck/scapula area down to my wrist and hand/fingers. Still couldn&#39;t sleep on my left side. Friday, I was definitely doing better with all the other symptoms, I could abduct my arm more than 90 degrees, so I was excited about that. I did wake up with my middle/ring finger hurting (at the base of that area) and a bit numb so put my hand in and out of a fist. The pain subsided, but the numbness/tingling sensation was still there. I continued to take aleve hoping that maybe there was just inflammation around the nerve causing the issue.  Aleve did help, but it still never went away completely.  By late afternoon, I was getting concerned if I was permanently affected by this. As I was holding a bowl of food and eating, my left arm was going numb. I was even feeling it into my gluts (sciatica?). Again...all of this was after the shot and only on the side I received the shot. That evening I was able to lay on my left side, but not for long periods of time because it became uncomfortable and arm would go numb. Saturday, I still had the nerve pain and was not in a good spot.  It made me sad, angry, scared, and I didn&#39;t want to talk about it too much-just wanted my arm and all the different radiating pains I was having to be back to normal. I was feeling it up into my neck, scapula, my side(the rib area I previously mentioned), even into my gluts and down leg near ankle as well as down the arm into elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand, fingers (particularly that middle finger and thumb area).  I tried to use my arm as normally as possible thinking maybe I need to just keep it moving, but it would fatigue, especially between shoulder and neck. I tried Ibuprofen on this day.  Again, the pain relievers helped some, but didn&#39;t take it all away. Sunday I was in a horrible spot mentally and crying throughout the day because of the sensations I was feeling still: up and down the arm, shoulder, neck, scapula, side and still into ankle area. I decided I would call my doctor on Monday. Monday, I woke up and was feeling better overall, but still having the nerve sensations down my arm as well as up into shoulder, neck, scapula and my left side.  But everything was not as intense.  I spoke to my doctor who said there was a protocol, a number I needed to call.  Monday night I took ibuprofen because I started to have a horrible headache-didn&#39;t go away completely and still have this morning-not sure if it&#39;s related or just a normal headache. Still feeling tingling nerve sensations into forearm and fingers.  My shoulder/neck area feels fatigued, but so far not noticing the nerve pain yet, so that&#39;s a positive. On Monday,  it seemed to get worse as the day went on, so we will see. I definitely feel in hand/wrist/fingers as I am typing now. I know this is a lot, and I think I&#39;ve captured it.  Again, I had none of this pre-shot.  The pain during injection is what alarmed me most as I expected side effects after the shot, but not this nerve type issue.  For this to be lasting as long as it is concerns me, and the fact that it exhibits on my left side where I got the shot. I am very anxious as it hasn&#39;t gotten back to normal.

                                                At time of shot, burning in arm as serum was being injected, and extreme dizziness where I almost fell off the chair. Dizziness lasted for a few minutes which created nausea. Sat at site for approximately 25 minutes after shot. Left arm was sore between shoulder and elbow, which was to be expected. Later in the evening, experienced fatigue. When trying to go to bed around 11pm,  my left are was throbbing. I did take Tylenol at about 6pm. Throughout the AM hours, sever body aches started, extreme fatigue throughout the following day. Flu like symptoms continued the next day.  I had heard of these symptoms for the other shots but not for Johnson and Johnson. Hungry but too weak to actually cook.

                                                I received the vaccine at approximately 1:08 pm.  Once administered I was instructed to sit in the auditorium for 15 minutes for observation.  During that time I had a few heartrate increases and nausea but nothing out of the ordinary or concerning.  After the 15 minutes, I walked out to my car and thankfully my husband had driven because what happened next would have caused an accident.  Our drive home is approximately 20 minutes from where vaccine was administered.  In the car I began to feel a tingling all over my body that gradually began to feel like ?pins and needles? (like when you sit on your legs for too long and they ?fall asleep?), with the worst of the feeling being in both of my hands. I began opening and closing my fingers to try and get them to feel normal.  By the time we pulled into the driveway, my hand had locked up in a weird position and I was no longer able to communicate with them and make them move.  They were temporarily paralyzed.  My husband opened the door for me because I wasn?t capable of doing so.  Once I stepped out of the car, my body began to convulse and shake.  We stood there for a few minutes because one, I couldn?t make my body cooperate and two, we didn?t want our children seeing me that way.  My husband kept asking me if he should call an ambulance.  Of course, he should have but I think he was so scared and shocked that he just didn?t know how to react.  I had trouble forming words and sentences at that point and could not tell him to call. I felt pretty calm considering what was happening to me and I could not control myself.  My husband decided to walk away from me and coerce me to go to him.  I stood there for a few minutes trying to communicate with my legs.  Once I took my first step, my body stopped shaking and I started to regain feeling in my hands.  I went and laid down for a bit and began to feel a bit better.  Around 7pm I was feeling extremely cold.  So cold that I put on three layers of clothing and two comforters to try and warm myself.  That did not work though, as it was more of a cold from nerve endings than it was from temperature.  I went to bed around 9pm but didn?t fall asleep until around midnight.  I was feeling waves of cold down my body. Like a skin prickling when you hear a beautiful song and you get goosebumps and your hairs stand up.  I woke around 3am to an extreme headache and a fever of 102.6.  I took Tylenol and went back to bed.  When I woke in the morning, I felt better but had weird and random muscle twitching.  For the past few days I?ve been suffering with extreme fatigue which is not like me at all.  Even when I?m tired, I can still manage to function throughout the day.  Not only have I been tired, my body is weak, my muscles are weak and my joints hurt. I?m hoping this ends soon and doesn?t get any worse. It will be two weeks this Sunday.

As injection was being administered I felt pain on inside upper arm down to wrist. Pain subsided. Day progressed. I used my arm to grocery shop. About 6:30 -7:00pm I noticed stiffness and inability to lift arm with extreme pain in attempts to lift arm. During the night had restless sleep. Had to use other hand to move arm into resting positions. No comfortable position.  Saw general practitioner on 4/12/2021. Received a paper with physical therapy exercises. Today, 4/13/2021, Still extreme pain to stretch arm to side and in front. If raising arm overhead with help in range of motion exercises (abduction) cannot lower arm without severe excruciating pain in inner shoulder area. New symptom includes numbness in wrist and forearm.

Chest tightness and heart racing ? Simply felt I was going to die ? of course I didn?t but it was the worse feeling in life worst than flu symptoms

                                                I received my shot around 5pm on April 7th at the pharmacy. My left arm was a little sore and I felt a bit woozy but aside from that everything seemed okay. Approximately 5-6 hours after my vaccine my period started back up which was strange as I just finished my cycle on Friday, April 2nd. My period was pretty heavy in comparison for the first 3-4 days and then finally stopped again on Sunday, April 11th.  I am 1 week past my vaccine and everything seems fine for now and I hope it continues.

At night I woke up from deep sleep and started crying that my leg  was hurting badly and felt like something was stuck in my knee couldn?t  move for couple min.  5 min later I got up to take pain medicine and try to walk  and  I was able to walk after that so went to use bathroom ( to urinate) while I got up.   After that since I had pain in my leg earlier  I went to grab  pain medicine than again I started crying and saying I don?t feel good than I passed out completely and was unconscious.   My husband picked me up and brought me to bed and said I had black out and fell on my face  on floor .

                                                About 5 minutes after I received the shot, had a sudden burning sensation in the middle of my chest that radiated out. I thought that was it for me. Nausea, dizziness, numbness in my left cheek and arm, got a funny taste in my mouth. This got pretty intense and lasted about 10 minutes. They had me stay in observation for another 45 minutes as those symptoms came in waves but never as intense as the first time. They let me go and I went home to rest. On the way home my cheeks became flushed and it felt like my eyes and cheeks were swelling. I had a lot of other symptoms over the next several hours which I wrote down. Early Tuesday morning those symptoms went away and I was left with some flu like symptoms, dizziness and a brain fog like I have never had before.

She also started to experience &#34;leg pain&#34; or &#34;tendon pain&#34; in the groin area.  All side effects subsided within about 24 hours except the leg pain.  It has now been 5 days and she is still having this pain with any movement of the body.  If she is resting and sitting still, she is fine.

                                                flu like symptoms with headache 4/8/21. Chest pain, nausea, sweating, lightheadedness  started 4/10/21, was seen in ER and discharged home. White count was noted as 2.8. Chest pain went away after 24 hours and palpitations started 4/11/21, severe at times for several hours at a time. Saw my cardiologist on 4/15/21 for severe palpitations and he ordered a halter monitor to be worn for 2 weeks. I stated  to him that I felt like I was in SVT, or something stronger than just palpitations. This continued for several hours a day from 4/11/21 to 4/24/21, when I was on the telemetry pack at work and went into an arrythmia that was later evaluated by my cardiologist as SVT and A FIB. On 4/25/21, I had mild &#34;palpitations&#34; but have not had any incidences since. I am now on metoprolol to control it and did not have a cardiac issue prior to receiving the vaccine.

She was very nervous and crying in the chair. She received the vaccine promptly and remained in the chair for a few minutes before getting up to sit in the auditorium bleachers. after about 20 or more minutes someone shouted that saw her fall in the bleachers, she was face down between the benches. She was conscious and responding, breathing normally, with normal pulse when we examined her. She got up slowly and recovered without needed further medical attention.

                                                2 hours after the vaccine, I started to feel very achy, and had terrible chills.  That lasted through the night and I woke up with a slight fever, 99.9.  The aches were in my joints and muscles.  It actually felt like I was having back labor. I took advil, and I was able to sleep and sweat out the fever. These symptoms were similar to one of my worst Lupus flares.  These symptoms lasted until Tuesday, 3/9/21, afternoon.  The following Sunday, my joints feel extremely stiff and achy.  Not sure if it has anything to do with the vaccine.  I took Advil and it seemed to help.

                                                I started feeling nauseous right away, so I had to wait for 30 min. Later that night I started throwing up. I was sick for almost 3 days. I rested a lot because I couldn&#39;t move because I was so tired, achy, really cold and I threw up everything I happened. I waited to contact my doctor in hopes that it would go away, but I couldn&#39;t stop vomiting. By that Monday, I decided to get help. I was told to go to the hospital to get rehydrated. They did a CT Scan and they didn&#39;t find anything. I am waiting to follow up with my doctor since I am still throwing up.

My husband was monitoring me, laid down and elevated my legs above my head, took Benadryl, hydrated, and rested. When I could stand, I took a pure hot shower to warm up. I thought I was going to die. The episode started to lessen about 45 minutes after taking Benadryl and elevating legs. Much better today but still not feeling well.

Because of this, I was getting nauseous and fever spikes. Then about 3:30am, I had water like diarrhea. After that, I started to feel dizzy (I was fine as long as I still) with cold chills along with being very tired.  When I got home, I took some Ibuprofen and took a nap (4 hour nap). Began to feel much better. When I woke up, I felt better but still had a stiffness in my shoulder blade area and left side neck.

                                                The next morning after the vaccine I woke up with my ears ringing, a bad headache, was really tired and not feeling well.  My arm was so super sore I couldnt lift it over my head.  On 3/10 the headache was still there but I  felt a little better.  But the ringing in my ears has been since day one and the headaches have been off and on as well since then also and on 3/25 I couldnt take it anymore so I went to see my PCP who referred me to an Audiologist but that appointment isnt until 4/29

                                                Upon receiving the shot, I immediately felt lightheaded, not dizzy or vertigo but just detached from my surroundings. I felt spacey. I felt like that for the rest of the day. I took Tylenol as the clinic recommended. Then after I went to bed later that evening I developed a headache that woke me up around 3:00am. I was very uncomfortable, experienced chills and was sore all over like I had worked out hard. I also experienced joint pain which I don&#39;t normally have. I still feel rough this morning and running a slight fever of 100F. I just wanted to report my side effects.

I didn?t think it was a big deal, but it was unusual for me to faint.  I haven?t fainted since I moved in 1985 because of altitude.  I also had moderate body aches different from my fibromyalgia or RA symptoms.  This all happened about 25 hours after I received the Johnson Johnson vaccine.  I didn?t think to report it until I read the news.  I am fine now and don?t need any help.

Pharmacist had instructed me to wait 15 minutes after injection in case of a reaction, which I did. I felt fine when I left the store and got into my car, but while driving home, I began to have the symptoms described above. I pulled into a hospital ER parking lot and stayed in or near my car until the symptoms subsided. I called my GP and talked to a nurse, who said if I could breathe and swallow, I was safe to go home. I did not enter the hospital ER or seek medical treatment because the symptoms did not get worse. After returning home and waiting about another hour, facial numbness completely subsided.

                                                Around five hours after shot I felt what I would describe as brain fog and light headache, by the evening I was aching, chilling and had 101 fever. Aches in my muscles and joints as if I had Rocky mountain spotted fever again. That is what the side effects reminded me of. This went on for over 48 hours. I have never been so sick. Very nauseous by next day. Also fell to the floor from nearly passing out the following morning. Took a minute for the light headed To pass. Arm pain still today. It was very scary and seemed to be a very serious reaction. Friday after noon finally started feeling better. The other strange part of this is that my daughter and best friend and I received the shot together in the same lot number and every one of us was deathly ill with the same symptoms. I am the only one with the fainting spells. Still feel fatigued today. And shoulders and left arm injection site still sore and achy.

Within approx. 30 minutes, I was having extreme chills, some slight stomach cramping, and the neck/upper back aches became very intense. It felt like a case of the flu, but worse. I did not experience vomiting. I took 600mg of Ibuprofin at about 10:00pm Those symptoms ended at approx. 12:30am on 4/8/2021. I was quite exhausted all day on 4/8/2021. Throughout the day on 4/8/2021, I felt lightheaded and a bit dizzy. That symptom lasted for just that day only. I continued to feel tired through 4/9/2021. I now feel completely recovered.

                                                Started feeling  tired so I laid down. While laying down  and as time progressed, my head started aching very bad, my arm that received the shot started hurting,  I had chills, joint pain, it hurt to touch my skin, off balance when trying to walk,  some nausea but I could eat some, I felt  pen sensation poking areas in legs but mostly my abdominal area. Overall a feeling of ratchetness,  pain, and misery.  Next morning I woke with the headache  and sore arm but I felt MUCH better. By Monday, all I had was sore arm and slight headache. Now, today, Tuesday, I have small headache, some coughing, sore forearm and thigh (really weird because this just started). Overall I feel good and I am glad that Saturday is over!

                                                by 10-11 p.m. that night severe chills. did not sleep the entire night due to extreme headache, chills, fever (102&#43;), body aches.  felt truly awful.     by 6 am Saturday feeling nauseated and wound up vomiting. Saturday night/Sunday -- not 100%, no appetite, intermittent nausea, but able to work/do normal activities. Monday 4/5--nausea at an 8-9 in the morning and kept a trash can next to me during virtual hearings I had that day.   Intermittent nausea throughout the week and not much appetite but made sure I was eating/drinking despite that.   Wednesday night 4/7 -- I went to use a PT stick on my left leg b/c I had felt a little pain in my left knee and figured my quadriceps were fibrotic.  I could barely put any pressure on my left thigh. I had never experienced anything like this.  As soon as I started rolling the stick on my leg, my skin was immediately red and warm and my leg was so sore and tender I had to stop.   Saturday 4/10 -- woke up with severe headache and later that morning felt very weird in my head/heart, like heart racing and my head felt &#34;spinny.&#34;  Felt like I might pass out at one point so I had one of my kids sit on my bed with me until I felt a little better. Sunday 4/11 -- had another episode like Saturday (headache and lightheaded/spinny/pass out feeling/slow speech) and asked neighbor (an RN) to take my BP.  her at-home device said 147 over something and she suggested I go to urgent care just to double check.   About three hours later, I was seen at  urgent care.  BP was normal, heart rate normal, oxygen was 96.  4/13--followed up with primary doctor.  Send me for blood work to check platelets, etc.  Feeling pretty good today but nervous after the news and the pause.

On Saturday,  I woke with up my equilibrium being off ( kinda like when you&#39;re on a ship ) and pretty intense back and joint pain.  By Saturday  night, my equilibrium  was a little better but I still had back pain. I went to see the doctor and was advised to take Advil.  By Sunday, my equilibrium was better and there was a reduction in back pain. Each day  the back pain has gotten better.

The pain occured in the groin and knee area and mostly through the thigh. I took 1000mg of Tylenol and it helped resolve the pain. The following day (4/11) I experienced the same leg pain and continued with Tylenol which helped. Monday I had dizziness and almost fainted so I went to the ED to get examined (4/11). I have a family history of blot clotting and carry the prothrombin gene mutation so I&#39;m aware of issues with leg pain and get evaluated. The pain has continued over the week and is now in my left leg with mild pain. Visited walk in clinic to have a follow up on 4/15 and they administered a Covid test.

On 3/27 patient stated she couldnt move and felt like a tingling sensation on the left arm (felt like ants crawling on body), felt dizzy, headache. She stated she then went to the ER on 4/15/21. CT scan (chest) and ultrasound(legs) was done and she wasnt sure of the results (the ER doctor only informed her that she wouldnt be #7). Then on 4/17 patient state she felt fine and was back to exercising and running.  Then on 4/24 she stated she went to the beach to run and felt a sting/cramp on right leg, she looked and noticed a bruise and then as of 4/26 her leg is sore, it&#39;s not red, not hot and not hurting, just sore to touch. Bruising is going away but just uncomfortable to touch.  Patient states she been feeling a little more fatigued and winded out when doing things now more than before  and before taking the vaccine.   Been a 1.5years since her last asthma attack. Since a month ago is when she started to feel that she needs to catch her breath more often. Patient stated she saw her PCP on 4/19/21 and she was prescribed another inhaler (can&#39;t recall the name) and antibiotic.   CT scan was done when she was in the ER because pt had chest pain. No pulmonary embolism indicated on results but she states her scan came back with something on it but she wasnt able to explain what was on there. When she was in the ER the doctor didnt prescribe anything but when she went to see pcp her MD prescribed her an antibiotic (cant recall name, she picked up the rx but hasnt started taking it yet- wasnt home to obtain the name).   As of 4/26 her headache, leg cramps have subsided, she just feels very fatigued. She stated that every time she has a headache she takes tylenol. The last time she took tylenol was on Sunday 4/25/21.  Advised patient to start taking the antibiotic as prescribed by the pcp and to take the inhaler when she feels winded out. Also advised her that if she feels chest pain or extreme sob then to either contact her pcp again or urgent care  She has no follow up scheduled with her PCP.

                                                Felt like mild flu at first - fatigue, headache, nausea. The nausea continued for a couple of weeks off and on and resulted in vomiting on 4-17-21. I vomit maybe once every few years. The nausea seemed to be slowly resolving, but I began feeling terrible the afternoon of 4-29-21. By 4-30, my feet began throbbing with stabbing pain, pain radiated up to knee in right leg. Entire body pain started, hurt to walk, started vomiting and diarrhea, with fever until 5-3. I still haven?t kept food in me. I used Aleve and Tylenol for fever, drank Pepto to attempt calming stomach, and used ice packs on my feet and a heating pad on stomach to try and decrease the cramping. Don?t know temp, thermometer battery was dead, but went between freezing cold sweating to burning up (dry hot and sweaty at other times).  I can?t attribute feeling like this to anything else and there?s no possibility of being pregnant.

                                                Eight days after the vaccine, I started to feel light headed and I thought I was just fatigued. I woke up at 3am and started to pass out and I couldn&#39;t see and falling down. I went to the ER and my pulse and blood pressure were low and I was mildly dehydrated. I had Sinus Bradycardia which they said may be transient. I have never had an unusual rhythm readings.  I experienced the lightheadedness for about a week. I did not drive or ride my bike because I might need to lay down.  Three weeks after the vaccine it seemed to get better a little a time and the events were less frequent. It has been four weeks and I feel fine now and I have resumed my normal activities.

Arm was sore but no more than any other vaccine. close to 4 hours later, headache started, felt hot and cold. Hard to sleep, sweating a lot during the night. Headache was so bad it felt like a combination of a bad flu with a hangover. felt very thirty. In the morning I was dizzy, hot, cold, temp 99.8, sick to my stomach, coudn&#39;t taste food very well, just like when you have the flu, nothing taste good. I spend the following day in and out of sleep, very tired, hard to focus. The sensation for being hot and cold continued. Took Imitrex to alleviate the headache/migraine . I did help, but not much. Hard to eat due to an upset stomach. Today is the first full day. I hope I&#39;m better tomorrow

It is difficult to use the arm because of the pain .  I can?t sleep right now so I figured I would fill this out.

All over body aches, no appetite, weakness, fatigue, headache, nasal congestion, burning eyes, ataxia, lightheadedness. Took my AM meds including hydrocodone-APAP which caused the fever to break but stayed low grade until the following afternoon around 2 PM. Helped with the body aches somewhat as well. Appetite started to return this morning, 3 days after the vaccine but the fatigue, weakness, muscular pain and a general unwell feeling continues.

                                                I went to bed with a stomach ache around 10:00pm.  At 3:00am I was awoken by severe abdominal pains/cramps and in a cold sweat.  When I got out of bed I was lightheaded and passed out in the bathroom as I was getting Tylenol.  I took 2 Tylenol and had diarrhea about 10 mins later.  I went to get some gatorade and passed out again in the hallway on the way to the kitchen.  About an hour after taking Tylenol symptoms began to improve but became nauseous and couldn&#39;t get back to sleep.  As of 2pm Sunday current symptoms are extreme nausea and extreme exhaustion.

                                                Approximately a half hour after the Janssen vaccine was administered on Monday, March 15, 2021 at 2:00pm, I felt a dull ache/sensation in the back, lower part of my head. No other symptoms that day. Today is Tuesday,  March 23 and I am still experiencing side effects from the vaccine. The side effects, other than the &#34;brain ache&#34; come and go. The side effects include what I can describe as a &#34;brain&#34; ache, some itching (3/16), random sweating, arms feeling like dead weight, overall general feeling sick, random body aches (don&#39;t last long), dragging of feet when walking, noises being louder than what they actually are, brain &#34;fog&#34;, dizziness, nausea, tingling in legs and feet .  What I describe as a &#34;brain ache is a different feeling than a headache or migraine.  It is as if my brain actually hurts. A very notable side effect that occurred on  Wednesday, March 17, was an episode of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. Throughout my life I have experienced AIWS  at bedtime.  On Wednesday, I experienced an episode during the day and it lasted for three hours.  My session is going to log me out.  I cannot type anymore.  Please contact me for more inforamtion.

Basically every muscle hurt and I really couldn&#39;t move.  I spent the entire day in bed unable to eat or even move. I had to take the day off from work.   I think I had Covid in Feb 2020 before testing began. The symptoms I felt in February 2020 were exactly the same beginning 12 hours after the vaccine.

I took 25 mg. of Bendryl which helped with the breathing. I felt very faint and experienced episodes of high blood pressure which lead to  uncontrollable shaking. I broke out in hives accross my arms and chest.  I laid with my feet elevated for one hour at which time symptoms subsided and I was able to leave the pharmacy. I had no further allergy type symptoms after leaving the site.

The best way to describe the burning feeling in my arm  is the feeling of when you receive a local anesthetic or a nerve block at the dentist.  It lasted for 30 seconds to 1 minute .  I began to feel nauseous and hot, I broke into a sweat and called over someone as I felt like I was going to pass out.  All happened within the first 3 minutes in the waiting area.  I sat with the medics for a few minutes and I returned to normal.  I never lost consciousness.  I was able to leave after the 15 minutes.

On Saturday evening my right arm started to hurt from my bicep to my fingers. When I woke up Sunday morning I couldn?t move my arm without extreme muscle and nerve pain. I wasn?t able to make a fist or grip anything in my hand. It eased up throughout Sunday and by the evening it was fine. Also on Sunday morning I vomited twice and once in the evening. By the evening I also had diarrhea, which is still going on. I woke up Monday feeling sore all over had a fever of 101.9. The fever broke the same day. Throughout Monday and more so on Tuesday and today I am constantly itchy especially my fingers. It feels like I have things crawling on me. I called my pcp yesterday (Tuesday) gave them my symptoms told them I had been vaccinated on 4/6. They didn?t call me back until today (Wednesday) &amp; wouldn?t let me split the office fee in two so they wouldn?t see me. I also called the pharmacy on Tuesday  spoke to the pharmacist was advised what was going on is side effects and I needed to report it. The diarrhea and itchy feeling is keeping me from being able to work and I?m not sure what to do from here.

                                                I am not sure if my event was caused by the vaccine I received on  April 8, but I have a very strong feeling it is, as never in my life have I experienced anything like it.  My day began normally, and I just had returned home from an appointment.  I had some lunch, and a few minutes later as I was standing in my kitchen,  I began sweating terribly,  heart was racing, and I felt like I was going to pass out.  I  managed to make it to a large living room chair, and once I say down and put my head back, I passed out.   My daughter witnessed everything and said when I passed out, my arms were trembling and my eyes rolled back.  This lasted for about 30 seconds.  She was unable to arouse me for a bit, but when I came to my speech was slurred.   I did not know what had happened.  My daughter called 911.  By the time medics arrived, I was feeling much better and aware of everything happening.  The checked for signs of stroke, vital signs, blood sugar, and everything was normal.   I was transported to the ER, and my work up there was normal, including EKG and blood work.  The physician that I saw diagnosed me with  vasovagal syncope and did not feel the event was related to the vaccine.  I  completely recovered, and like I said  I?m not sure if it was related to the vaccine I received or not.  I just feel that it may be worth noting since I?ve never had an experience like this and  I?m pretty healthy with really no medical history.

If I had been home, I absolutely would have been laying down. My heart was also racing. I then felt cold all over. My experience lasted about 10 mins and probably 7 mins into it, I did start to feel better. The experience was quite scary. I thought I could have ended up in the hospital.

                                                The next day after the vaccine around 12n I began feeling really fatigued and developed a fever off and on through out the day which went as high as 101 causing me to take a tylenol.  I had chills, muscle aches and a cough started.  I had a headache on Sat and Sunday. Sunday I was still fatigued,  slight temp, winded and lightheaded more than dizzy.  The temp finally diminished by the Sunday evening but still winded and very fatigued to date.  I reached out to my PCP for the SOB I was experiencing who advised if it gets any worse to go to the ER for further assistance and the symptoms still persisted so on Tues I went to the Urgent Care but they referred me to a outside makeshaft to setup for COVID testing but nothing still was done.  So  I went back to ER who checked my O2 sats which was good but still nothing was done there either and I am still experiencing the SOB.   I developed a bruise on my left forearm which developed yesterday and today my lower legs has developed various light colored little greyish looking bruises and is very sensitive to the touch.

Volume of high pitched tinnitus and clogged/numb sensation in ear is very distressing, Ear doctor gave me rx for prednisone which I&#39;ve started. Also had fever of 101, chills, pain in both legs but these resolved by day two.

A month later when I was about to start my menstrual cycle I developed the same symptoms which have never happened during that time of the month. I would usually feel a little fatigue and general discomfort but this time I got really sick with chills, body ache, nausea, dizziness, just as I did immediately after the shot.  It may not be related but I just wanted to report it in case someone else had the same problem.  It was just strange that in all my years of having a cycle that has never happened before.

The symptoms  lasted in their intensity and severity for aproximatly 13 days. I was pretty much bed ridden. My symptoms were: moderate to severe chills and body aches, EXTREME fatigue, Lymphnodes swollen in neck, the lymp in the right side of neck is still VERY sore (oddly, the oposide side of where I recieved the vaccine).  Today is the 14th day, and the symptoms have finally decreased. I thought I should let you know.  I did contact my doctor twice to inform her. She suggested rest and lots of liquids.

                                                I experienced an immediate reaction within minutes of getting the shot. Symptoms were a flush through my abdomen and then dizziness, lightheadedness. Felt like my motor skills were shutting down and was getting weakness like I was about to pass out. Although I have a lot of allergies to medication, I have NEVER had a reaction to a vaccine before. I was taken in for observation and this was reported. The day after the shot I woke  up with a excruciating  headache that last all day intermittently for five days with no relief from ibuprofen.  Right leg throbbing pain and hot on second day. Third day had very severe pain in the abdomen like a lot of gas early in the morning while sleeping.

                                                I had an EMG performed last week which was normal and a F/U with the neurologist because I am still experiencing the numbness to the right side of my body and when performing activities it gets worse.  I have developed a limp and I dont have the strenght in my hands and feet that I once had.  When I push myself to perform activities the numbness , fatigueness, and pain is just so intense that its nearly impossible.  If I continue to try to push myself to perform activities its as if my body begins to shut down and does nothing.  Its as if im ok until I begin to perform any body activities.

                                                Pt received the injection and within 10 minutes she started to feel lightheaded and nauseous. She also stated her tongue felt a little tingly and numb.  She was taken into our immunization room and she started out seating then decided she would feel better laying down. We gave her a half of a Benadryl to help with the nausea. She was given cold compresses, water and some ice to suck on. Her blood pressure was taken and was 122/70 mmHg, heart rate was 58 bpm.  She was laying down for approximately 20 minutes, then stated she was feeling better and moved to a sitting position. She was felt she was improving, and after a few minutes of sitting decided she felt well enough to leave. She did state as she was leaving that she has a similar reaction when she gets blood drawn and that she had been nervous about getting the shot.

                                                Bell&#39;s palsy symptoms within an hour after receiving vaccine injection:  consisted of right-sided facial numbness, right-sided eyelid droop, right-sided mouth turn, right-sided tightness in neck muscle, pressure behind right eye, headache, loss of balance, difficulty speaking.  The injection was at 3:15 pm and started with arm soreness and stinging, a slight headache, and some tingling in my right hand while waiting 15 minutes after the shot, I had also felt a sensation going up the right side of the back of my neck almost immediately after the injection.  The Bell&#39;s palsy symptoms started by 4:00 pm.  I had a low-grade temp that evening of 99.9.  I emailed my neurologist who I see for migraines, of my symptoms.  The following morning on 03-10-2021 I woke with a severe migraine, fullness in my right ear, more pressure behind my right eye and it is watery, with new ringing in both ears, louder in the right ear.   Still residual numbness and drooping of right side of face and eye, tightness in right side neck muscle in front, and speaking better.   Woke up on Thursday morning 03-11-2021 with flu symptoms and migraine gone.  Eye pressure still there and now having significant pain moving my eye and now more feeling of fullness in my right ear.  Eye pain was concerning.  Dr advised me at this time if symptoms have continued or gotten worse to go to the emergency room.   Today, Saturday 03-13-2021, I am still experiencing moderate eye pain behind/above my right eye with pressure.  I am continuing to treat the pain with oxycodone prescribed by ER Physician.

Patient stated she has some full budding numbing experience but no anaphylaxis. We gave her the J&amp;J covid 19 vaccine and asked her to wait 30 minutes to be monitored due to her past allergies. Around 20 minutes patient let one of the pharmacist know she was feeling very flushed and dizzy. We brought her over to the side to be monitored more closely. We had patient elevate her feet to help with faint feeling and drink some water.  Within 5 to 10 minutes her symptoms  started worsening. Tingling sensation started going up her side of head and neck. It started moving to the front of her face. Once that happened I asked how her breathing was and she was starting to get short of breath. Soon after patients throat started to close. We administer 0.3 m of epinephrine and called 911. Pt was able to breathe a little better but within 5 minutes she was back to gasping for air, we administered another 0.3 mg of epinephrine and the paramedics arrived.

We gave her a cold pack to place on her neck/face and continued to monitor her bp every 5 minutes. Each bp reading was higher than the last (98/62, 126/77, 116/83). After the fourth bp reading, the patient reported that she felt well enough to go home and she left.

                                                37 hours after vaccination I had excruciating pain in my back - lower right side. I could barely walk without experiencing pain that made me keel over. I used IcyHot with Lidocaine on the spot throughout the day. I took Aleve pain reliever, and iced the location also. Pain is very slowly subsiding. Still sore now (72 hours after vaccination) but am able to do daily functions.

                                                The patient received a Janssen COVID vaccine on 4/8/21 at around 5:00 pm.  The patient was nervous during the administration and reported never receiving a flu vaccine in the past.  The common side and serious side effects were discussed with the patient.  The vaccine was administered to the patient without issue.  The patient and husband instructed to wait 15 minutes after the administration of the vaccine as is the recommendation per the CDC.  About 5 minutes after the administration of the vaccine, the patient&#39;s husband notified the pharmacy staff that his wife was not felling well.  Pharmacist responded to the patient.  The patient reported shortness of breath and feeling hot and stated she was about to pass out.  Pharmacist was instructed to retrieve the Epi-Pen from the immunization cart and assist.  Code White was called and Division 1 staff responded and assisted.  The patient was lowered to the ground and her feet were elevated.  It was at this point that it was determined that the patient was not experiencing anaphylaxis based on the symptoms she was reporting and exhibiting.  The patient was instructed to remove mask to help obtain better breaths and remove the patient from hyperventilation.  An icepack was obtained and placed on the patients neck once she was able to sit up.  The patient&#39;s symptoms improved to the point of moving to a chair.  The patient sipped water and continued deep breathing.  The patient&#39;s symptoms continued to improve and she was able to leave.

Wednesday, Thursday and Friday - I had headaches and I had extra fatigue (I already do have fatigue because I have insomnia). My arm soreness was on the other arm not on the one that I had an injection. Friday and up until yesterday, I had nausea. Saturday, I had headache and being tired. Sunday, I had chest pain (woke up with it) like a burning in my chest. My left arm, I felt a tingling down my arm to my legs - it almost felt like a blood clot was there in my arm. I had to put heat on and then ice. I couldn&#39;t extend arm because it hurt. Midnight on Monday, the burning and the chest pain was too much and I was getting worried. The only thing I have is asthma, otherwise I&#39;m healthy. I went to ER - they gave a Cocktail of Lidocaine; Malex and something else to see if it would help with the burning in my chest.  Monday, I took Tylenol. Tuesday, the chest pains were more intense.  03:00 on Wednesday am - I went back to ER. They brought me to a full chest x-ray - front, side and back and a CAT SCAN and gave me another Cocktail and also put something in my IV. This time,  they sent me home with four different medicines. The meds are: Generic of Nexium; Aspirin low dose of 81 mg - bayers children - one a day; Generic version of Bentil Triacetin   - I take this when I want to be still; Generic version of Valium - they gave me four of these - and I have one left that I will take tonight so I can sleep. I am taking Vit D. I haven&#39;t taken Tylenol since getting on these. I try to stay hydrated.  I still have a really really funny feeling inside me. Last night, I was very restless and couldn&#39;t sleep. It makes me on borderline and dizzy and my heart starts palpitating. It&#39;s a scary feeling in my chest.

                                                About 7 hours after the shot I was slightly light-headed but not badly then started to feel pain in my left shoulder joint, then left armpit, then soreness in my neck and upper back on my left side with beginning of headache. 2 hours later I developed fever reading 100.1 and got sniffly, headache increased a lot. Lay down. Headache increased, as did muscle aches which spread to all over but stronger on left side. My left knee, which had had a cortisone shot for pain on Monday and had been hurting less since Wednesday, suddenly hurt SO much! Took ibuprofen with slight relief of aches but not much help to headache or knee pain. Have had to ice knee continually and can no longer walk without limping, more actions than usual result in pain spikes in my knee. Headache and chills/fever constant all that night, along with aches and a lot of knee pain. Next day (today) headache, fever continuing, plus left shoulder join &amp; armpit pain, joint aches in general &#43; lots of knee pain. Took ibuprofen again. Helped enough to do basic things. Am resting with icing knee. Will be going back to bed shortly. (It has been 28 hours since my J&amp;J shot.) Please note: I do not normally take Ibuprofen (or Tylenol) unless desperate since it makes me nauseous.

                                                During my 15min wait (about 5 minutes after the injection) I started to become very hot and sweating profusely.  My ears started ringing and the noise in the room sounded like it was in slow motion.  I started to feel dizzy and clammy like I was going to pass out.  I got up and walked over to the paramedic and he sat me down and took my vitals.  All of my vitals were fine and I started to come out of the feeling of passing out.  After waiting another couple of minutes I went outside to get fresh and was able to go home.  I felt very tired and just not quite right the rest of the day and slept most of the day.  I was ok after that with just a fatigue and headache in the following days.

The next day I had moderate body aches, nausea, and mild light headedness.  I&#39;ve had those ongoing symptoms (minus the body aches) up to the present day.  They&#39;ve never really gone away, and continue to persist.  I did not have any of these symptoms prior to the shot.  I called my doctors office today to report the symptoms, and I&#39;m still waiting to hear back.

                                                On the day of my vaccine I had typical symptoms - chills, fatigue, and headache.  The next day I felt better, just tired.  On Tuesday the 23rd I returned to work and felt fine, but I did have an occasion of dizziness and I was tired.  I felt good on the 24th and returned to life/exercise as normal.  I woke up on the 25th in the early morning with a strange sensation in my head.  (I described it to my husband that it felt like I had worms in my head.)  When I got up I experienced dizziness that seemed like vertigo.  I tried to proceed with my day, but I got an intense headache, loss of appetite, and sore upper leg muscles.   I reached out to my doctors office.  I saw a doctor on the 26th.  (My dizziness was better, but I still had a headache and muscle aches.)  We discussed vertigo and possible reactions to the vaccine.  He also found some liquid in my ears and so we questioned allergies.  I got allergy medicine and took it when I got home.   The next day in the early morning the headache and muscle aches returned and I called a hotline through my doctor&#39;s office.  (The headache was quite intense.)  I spoke with a nurse - I was concerned that I may have Covid.  We discussed my reaching out to get a test if my symptoms were not better by Monday.  By Sunday I was feeling a bit better.  My headache had improved but I still had muscle aches in my legs.  I determined I would be able to go back to work on Monday.   The last symptom to remain was aches in my legs.  On Wednesday the aches were in my upper legs , by 3/30 the aches were in my ankles.  I was feeling better by early April.

She was given water, juice, and snacks. She felt dizzy and a bit nauseated at times. She admitted to not having eaten anything prior to the vaccine. At 1500, an hour after she received the vaccine she felt like her heart was racing and she reported that the whole right side of her body felt cold. People with her that knew her well stated that she &#34;was not herself&#34;. She also reported at this time that she felt like her heart was racing. This nurse recommended, by phone (patient had left the clinic site by this time) that the patient&#39;s mother take her in to urgent care or the ED, just to be sure everything was okay. Upon follow up, the patient did not go in but called the ED triage nurse. She was told this was likely a normal response to the vaccine. Patient went home to rest and her mother stayed with her overnight. Today client is back at work- tired and sore but nothing more reported.

                                                On March 21, 2021 at around 5:30 I had fever, headache, nausea, fatigue, dizziness. The next day, March 22, I had heart palpitations, dizziness and still fever.  On March 24, 2021 at approximately 8:00 pm, my right leg became heavy and felt numb. On March 25 I woke up to my mouth locked with Bell&#39;s Palsy like drooping on the right side of my face.  My mouth remained unable to open fully for the next day and the numbness and pain in my leg increased.  On March 26 I went to the ER because I was afraid I was having a stroke. They gave me tests and said I did not have a stroke. They gave me steroids and they helped with my jaw but the pain in my leg increased. The pain in leg continued with more pain in my knee. I followed up with my family doctor and they sent me to have an ultrasound of my leg to check for a blood clot on April 9th No blood clot was found. Pain continued and increased so the doctor sent me for an MRI on April 14. MRI showed moderate effusions to the knee joint and I have an appointment with a orthopedic doctor on Tuesday April 20th. I continue to have stabbing pain in my knee and swelling and discomfort.

                                                Immediate muscle tension in left arm  following vaccine shot in left arm.  The soreness persisted for several days. Painful to lift left arm higher than my shoulder.  The morning of day 3, I woke up to feel a pronounced skin irritation under my left armpit.  Later that day, I noticed a small welt on my left arm and the irritation had grown to include my upper left arm front and back. Over the next few days, the number of welts increased and the pain was increasing from the skin irritation. The tension in my shoulder started to give way to feeling tightness in my left chest.   I reported the symptoms. I tried to report to the Health Department, but they wouldn&#39;t take a report stating that the symptoms I was reporting did not match &#34;known symptoms&#34;.  On 4/13/21, I went to the Urgent Care to have the rash examined. The doctor tentatively diagnosed as Shingles. However, because of the chest pain, he referred to the Emergency Room for blood tests to rule out a possible Pulmonary Embolism.  The blood tests came back normal. I was prescribed 12 Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen for the pain and discharged.  On 4/15/21 I returned to Urgent Care because the welts were continuing to spread and the pain was increasing. Including sharp pains associated with the shingles. At this visit I was prescribed 21 tablets of Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen and 21 tablets of ValACYclovir.

I had a headache, body aches fever and chills. I experienced nausea for a couple of days and a rash on my back. It was a bumpy rash started a week after the shot and is still present. I was very unsteady on my feet and needed help to the bathroom. I missed work that day but went to work the next day. I felt very poorly with no energy for a week. I was super achy and have no balance. I have gotten stabbing pains in my legs especially in my right thigh which dissipate after a while. It has been ten days and I am still very tired with intermittent headaches, but I was able to work out today. My leg pain is less often and less than it used to be.

                                                Seven hours after I got the vaccine, I got a severe headache. It lasted all night and into the next day. I called the Nurse and she told me it might last two days. I tried multiple pain killers, and nothing worked. After twenty four hours I had a pressure sensation in my head. My normal Migraines cause dizziness. This time my head felt very full and it lasted 24 hours. On the third day I started to get light-headed ,and it lasted all day. Four days after the vaccine I started to get a more general headache and it lasted all day and it came and went for a few more days. Ice packs worked to relieve the pain with Aleve. I did not feel normal for twelve days after the vaccine.

                                                The adverse reactions of light headedness, throat irritation, heaviness in my chest and difficulty inhaling began about 20 min after my injection, It lasted 5 minutes. About 30 min afterwards the 2nd wave of reaction came on, with the same symptoms but was even harder to inhale and lasted twice as long. I took a combination of benadryl, motrin and pepcid which alleviated the worst of the symptoms after about an hour. To this day, I still cannot take a deep breath in.  About 72 hours after the vaccine I began to have diarrhea (and still have it 20 days later), lethargy, nausea and shortness of breath. The next day I had a little more energy, but still had continued shortness of breath. My vision had become less clear and my thought process a bit fuzzy. This is still happening today. Seven days after the vaccine,  I suddenly became extremely light headed just simply walking. To the extent that I needed to sit or lay down before I began to pass out. After the light headedness came on heavily, I also noticed a very heavy weight on my upper chest and found it quite difficult to inhale. These moments would come and go throughout the day. Regardless of whether I was just sitting and relaxing or walking around. These symptoms would last anywhere from a couple minutes to a couple of hours. I found it very hard to catch my breath and could feel my heart flushing often. Additionally I would wake in the middle of the night feeling that I needed to gasp for air. I sought medical assistance from a clinic, an ER and even my allergist and I am scheduled to see my family physician later this week.   I am not an anxious person, but have experienced many episodes in the last 20 days that have truly made me feel that I was going to die (no exaggeration!) due to the inability to breathe or that I may have been having a heart attack. I began to have chest pain that would travel from the center of my chest to my left shoulder. The pain also would move to my right lung area. During this I also had heaviness in my chest and felt I could not breathe in or out easily. I am still very light headed and have difficulty walking very far without taking a break because I feel I cannot catch my breath. I still have all of the same symptoms that I experienced 20 minutes after my vaccine. These symptoms have varied in intensity. I have often commented to my family that I feel the symptoms of the chest heaviness and heart flushing seem to come in waves. I am a health conscious person and have never had poor health in my life. The events in the last few weeks have definitely taught me how terrible life must be for those who chronically suffer from heart or lung issues. I am still currently battling these symptoms, however, the last few days seem the symptoms have often been less severe.

                                                Eleven Hours after the vaccine I got a fever body aches, chills and chest pain. The fever and flu symptoms went away after 24 hours but the stabbing chest pain lasted for 37 days. The pain was in the center of my chest in different places and it felt like tightening and clenching. The D-Dimer  was elevated and other tests were normal. My Platelets were tested later and were normal. Doctors indicated it was an inflammatory immune response. I went to a Cardiologist for a Stress test which showed ST depression. The chest pain stopped after 37 days. I did have shortness of breath which came and went over the course of four weeks. I am normally in good shape and I run, dance and work out two to four times a week. I have been unable to work out since this began. I also had lightheadedness, chest pain and palpitations seemed to go together. I still have lower back pain and Tinnitus which started two and a half weeks after the shot. It has been five weeks.

                                                Shortly after getting the shot she reported feeling &#34;off&#34; as she was driving she started feeling short of breath and her heart was racing. When she got home around 5 PM she was still feeling short of breath and reported that her heart was racing. She was unable to speak clearly, but was stating that it was due to be being short of breath.  She also reported feeling lethargic and fell asleep until the next morning. She slept until approximately 12 pm the next day. When she woke up she reported feeling right sided cheek tingling. At that time she thought she had just slept wrong. When she attempted to walk down stairs she was limping and reported just feeling very weak on her left side. On Wednesday she slept in late again complaining of lethargy. When she awoke that Wednesday (3/10) her speech was markedly slurred. She was also saying things that didn&#39;t make sense. She was dragging her left leg when she tried to walk. We immediately took her to the ER and she was worked up for stroke. When she was triaged in the ER we mentioned that she had just had her COVID vaccine and voiced concerned that maybe she had a reaction to her COVID vaccine. She was admitted to hospital on 3/10 for a possible stroke.  Her MRI was done later on 3/11, Her MRI showed that she has strokes on both sides of her brain in the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. The doctor referred to her stroke as being caused by a &#34;showering of clots&#34;. The doctor said this usually only happens to someone with cardiac issues. My mom has no cardiac history. Her doctor ordered an 2D Echo of her heart and no abnormalities were found (3/12).   She is still disabled from her stroke. She was hospitalized from 3/10 - 3/16. She was the discharged to other care facility from 3/16-3/26. She is currently needing outpatient rehab in a day neuro program. She attends this at outpatient facility. She has to walk with a cane due to persistent left leg weakness. Her speech has a slight slur, and she suffers from short term memory loss. She intermittently has trouble with her equilibrium and reports feeling dizzy. She sometimes has a hard time swallowing or says that it doesn&#39;t feel right when  she swallows. She also trouble with word retrieval. She has left-sided neglect which correlates  left eye visual deficits. She currently requires care from a general physician, neurologist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, neuro ophthalmologist and neuo psychologist. She was started on a new medication regime 325 mg aspirin daily, plavix for 21 days (now completed), metformin, amlodipine, coreg and losartan. She is going to need outpatient rehab until at least June from the last update we received from her rehab doctor.

First dismissed this as &#34;sleeping in the wrong position&#34; or tension from work.  Headache/muscle ache tightness really has not gone away since receiving the vaccine.  Have been to chiropractor 3 times for adjustment with no improvement.

I walked down my road singing and laughing just total delirium.    Maybe  bad choice of word but I don&#39;t know how to completely describe the disorientation.    My son, helped me get back home in which I laid down on the grass and just stared at the sky. My son, assisted me in to my home in which I slept several hours and woke up about 8:30 pm.      I feel embarrassed of my behavior although I know for a fact it is correlated to the vaccine shot.

                                                The adverse reactions of light headedness, throat irritation, heaviness in my chest and difficulty inhaling began about 20 min after my injection, It lasted 5 minutes. About 30 min afterwards the 2nd wave of reaction came on, with the same symptoms but was even harder to inhale and lasted twice as long. I took a combination of benadryl, motrin and pepcid which alleviated the worst of the symptoms after about an hour. To this day, I still cannot take a deep breath in.  About 72 hours after the vaccine I began to have diarrhea (and still have it 20 days later), lethargy, nausea and shortness of breath. The next day I had a little more energy, but still had continued shortness of breath. My vision had become less clear and my thought process a bit fuzzy. This is still happening today. Seven days after the vaccine,  I suddenly became extremely light headed just simply walking. To the extent that I needed to sit or lay down before I began to pass out. After the light headedness came on heavily, I also noticed a very heavy weight on my upper chest and found it quite difficult to inhale. These moments would come and go throughout the day. Regardless of whether I was just sitting and relaxing or walking around. These symptoms would last anywhere from a couple minutes to a couple of hours. I found it very hard to catch my breath and could feel my heart flushing often. Additionally I would wake in the middle of the night feeling that I needed to gasp for air. I sought medical assistance from a clinic, an ER and even my allergist and I am scheduled to see my family physician later this week.   I am not an anxious person, but have experienced many episodes in the last 20 days that have truly made me feel that I was going to die (no exaggeration!) due to the inability to breathe or that I may have been having a heart attack. I began to have chest pain that would travel from the center of my chest to my left shoulder. The pain also would move to my right lung area. During this I also had heaviness in my chest and felt I could not breathe in or out easily. I am still very light headed and have difficulty walking very far without taking a break because I feel I cannot catch my breath. I still have all of the same symptoms that I experienced 20 minutes after my vaccine. These symptoms have varied in intensity. I have often commented to my family that I feel the symptoms of the chest heaviness and heart flushing seem to come in waves. I am a health conscious person and have never had poor health in my life. The events in the last few weeks have definitely taught me how terrible life must be for those who chronically suffer from heart or lung issues. I am still currently battling these symptoms, however, the last few days seem the symptoms have often been less severe.

                                                Pt was given Janssen shot at 9:40am. Within 3-4 minutes, pt complained that she felt tingly, lightheaded, faint, and had issues breathing. She was instructed to sit in a chair along with her husband by her side. In the meantime, RPH called for help in the store. Store PIC came over and called 911. After the PIC was on the phone with 911 for 2-3 minutes, the pt complained of trouble breathing and faintness. She was then administered an epi-pen. She started to feel a little better, less faint and could breathe a little easier (maybe 10% improvement) but not great. After 5 minutes, the paramedics had not shown up yet so she was given another dose of epipen because she started to have more faintness, lightheadedness, sweatyness, tingly and SOB. 3-5 minutes after 2nd dose of epi was given, paramedics then arrived to the scene. They took her BP and it was ~ 76/40. They took her away in the aid car.

                                                4 hours after vaccine, dizziness, fatigue &amp; nausea. Extreme fatigue for 24 hours with BAD headache, &amp; body aches/weakness, fever &amp; chills. As bad as when I had COVID-19 (Positive PCR test early Dec 2020). Symptoms from vaccine went away completely after 48 hours.  **Still have long term effects from COVID-19 such as low oxygen saturation, (averages low 90?s),  shortness of breath, mental confusion, extreme fatigue, headaches, body aches, inner leg pain at top of leg, &amp;  NO smell/taste. Consider myself relatively healthy before COVID-19.  Push myself to try to do as did before COVID-19. Always social distance &amp; wear mask. Would NOT hesitate to get vaccine again! Benefits outweigh the side effects.  Expected short term symptoms since had  COVID-19.

She did have a fear of injections but said she was extremely happy because she hardly felt any pain from the injection. Shortly after sitting down for observation she began to feel extremely dizzy.  observed her condition and immediately attended to her. Fanning her to give her air and allowing her to lay her head back. informed of the need for someone to assist. After 15 minutes of the woman still not feeling better we decided to call for paramedics.  Paramedics arrived in 10 minute took vitals. Glucose 132. O2 sat 100%. BP 120/80.  Vitals were all good but patient still extremely nauseous and dizzy. Emt&#39;s administered oxygen and ice pack to neck. Woman began to become more alert and was responding better to questions. Due to her positive vitals the emts felt comfortable about leaving her after 15 minutes of oxygen treatment. Her husband and son walked her out.

                                                Minor headache, moderate nausea, dizziness occurred the evening of the injection.  Those symptoms continue the following day, along with vomiting and fatigue.  Vomiting occurred late in the evening after bending over to clean up cat vomit, which always sets off my gag reflex, but I was feeling like I could vomit before that anyway.  Also, I had just started taking Hydrochorothyozide the day of the injection and some of the things I experienced can be side effects of the medicine as well.

Next thing I know, I was on the floor. When I came to, I was disoriented and very sweaty.  The fall caused a cut to my head, bleeding and a bruised elbow. Within an hour, I was feeling less dizzy.

                                                Started out with immense headache which proceeded to chills and full body aches. Body aches were the worst part of it - they were so bad I could not get up or walk. They started middle of the night I received the vaccine, lasted all the next day and into the next morning. By that evening I felt much better with just a headache and by the following day all symptoms subsided    I had hardly any Odin at the injection site unless I pushed or laid on it and no swelling or rash at all.

Had an odd white noise in my ears - not &#34;ringing&#34; but buzzing kind of sound. Lasted for about 3-5 minutes and I ended up lying on the floor for about 15 minutes before I could get back up. Felt like I may blackout. It&#39;s three hours later and I&#39;m ok now.

                                                A few minutes after I received the shot I experienced an extreme intense feeling of warmth rush through my body.   My heart rate increased,  I had a sudden headache towards the back of my head and I became lightheaded.   The pharmacist gave me water and within 3-5 minutes, the reaction subsided and I felt better.  I felt fine the rest of the day after this brief reaction.

                                                I had the shot on weds afternoon. On Thursday I felt ill with flu-like symptoms, mainly body aches and headache. These symptoms were gone by Friday and I felt great. I woke up Saturday morning at 4:30am and needed to use the bathroom/, which is about 10 steps from my bed. As I entered the bathroom I completely blacked out, causing me to fall and break my ribs. This has never happened to me, and there was nothing else wrong with me (I spent 2 days in the hospital checking heart, brain, inner ear, etc). In addition to the 4:30am blackout, it also happened again several hours later at 11am, saturday morning. This time I again got so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stay on my feet, and while my husband was right there lowering me to the floor I was in a daze, a cold sweat, and absolutely no control over it.

                                                The night of my injection I woke up with extreme left arm and scapular pain.  It radiated down to my fingers.  It all was heavy and number and tingling.  That continued most of the day.  The next day I was extremely fatigued and weak and stayed in bed.  I think had left ear and lymph node pain on the left side of my face and neck.  This continued for days.  By the 1 week mark after my injection, I ended up at the urgent care with facial swelling and extreme lymph node pain.  They stated it was an adverse reaction to the vaccine.  As of yesterday, I continue to have some swelling in my jaw and occipital region as noted by the PTA where I go for physical therapy.  I continue to experience extreme fatigue, worse than normal and dizziness.  My left pinky still has some tingling and vibration feeling.  I also still get cramping on this finger and on the ulnar side of my palm.

                                                At 12 hours through 16 hours after administration of the vaccine I experienced rigorous shivers, feeling freezing cold to the bone for hours and couldn&#39;t get warm (even with piles of blankets), periodic heart pain and some chest pressure, periodic knife like stabbing pain in my right knee, mild nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, severe weakness, sometimes a cough.  At 16 hours I got up to get water and had to hold onto things to keep my balance. After drinking a couple of cups of water, I turned away from the bathroom sink and lost consciousness, fainting and falling onto my bathroom floor. The jolt of the fall woke me up and it took a lot of strength to get up. The symptoms were vicious. When I fainted, the brunt of my weight must of been on my upper left rib cage. My ribs were so sore for a week. It was difficult to walk, breath, blow my nose, or cough.  My health provider recommended a Tylenol regime for pain control so that I could take deep breaths and prevent pneumonia. I had a low grade fever of 99 degrees F for one to two days following the vaccine. During the week that followed I felt periodically very ill, had a constant headache for a day or two, and had extremely foggy thinking and sometimes confusion.  I was very fatigued all week long. I lost my appetite and have still not gained my typical appetite back. Day 8 to 9 is when I was finally feeling closer to normal. Today I feel I may be back to 100%, but my rib cage is still healing, either from a contusion, fracture, or break (likely a contusion).

Feeling very sore all over,  like I had a bad flu.  I was very fatigue,  sleeping 18 hours straight.  Extremely thirty,  diarrhea and vomiting.  By Tuesday night I was fine.  I was still sore all over,  but fever had gone back to normal &amp; I was able to eat some chicken noodle soup.  Wednesday morning I was back to me.  Feeling well now.

                                                An immediate burning sensation at the vaccination site as the vaccine was being injected. The burning sensation spread from the injection site upward to my  neck all the way to my right ear. The burning sensation then started from my injection site down to my elbow. The burning sensation stopped after a few minutes, then I felt silently nauseous and lightheaded.   After waiting 15 minutes I felt fine enough to go home. However, the pain and stiffness in my neck was ongoing throughout the following day and night and was only slightly relieved with 500mg doses of Tylenol every 4-5 hours.  On a couple of occasions the day of and the day following the vaccination I did feel fleeting chest pain, but not enough pain or intensity to warrant a trip to the doctor. This morning (4-11/21) the aching sensation in my neck and arm (primarily neck) have lessened, but still present.

Took Benadryl for two days.  The itching was getting worth.  Went to see  a doctor who prescribed IC Prednisone 10 mg tablet.  On the 3rd of taking the IC Prednisone, I felt dizzy and fainted, lose consciousness.  Ended up in ER.  Multiple bruises, lost 4 front teeth.

Since I received the shot I&#39;ve had dizzy spells daily.  It happens all throughout the day and typically lasts for 15 minutes to an hour each time, multiple times a day.  I contacted the pharmacy at the Health Services on 4-9-21 to ask if they had heard of anyone else having dizziness like I&#39;m having and they said no.  Told me I could take over the counter Meclizine to help with the dizziness and suggested I check in with my PCP - I have an appointment scheduled May 5th, so I planned on waiting until then unless it becomes worse.

                                                10 days after the vaccine I developed dizziness, tachycardia, dry mouth,chest pressure, shortness of breath and felt like I was going to pass out, and I had a feeling of extreme doom. I was transported to a clinic. There I had a heart rate of 140 with irregular beats. Continued feeling of doom. An EKG showed ST depression. Symptoms improved with nitroglycerin. The clinic didn&#39;t have the technology to provide care so I was emergently transported again. At that hospital my D-dimer was positive and that lead to a CT Angiogram. This showed a pulmonary embolism. Doppler studies of both legs were negative. I was placed on Heparin for several hours and then switched to Eliquis. About 6 hours after being on Eliquis I had the exact same original symptoms and again nitro was given which helped the symptoms. I was placed back on Heparin for a longer period of time. Once I was anticoagulated I was then switch to Eliquis 10mg BID for 7 days then 5mg BID for 6-9 months. I had a CT Angiogram of the head and neck which was normal. At this time I still have dizziness with standing and intermittently with sitting, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath.

It is sore to the touch and I cannot raise my arm above my head, I can lift shoulder level with minor pinching pain. But if I try to lift any higher it is severe pain inside the muscle of the bicep area where the shot was administered .  It has been constant pain since the shot and with ibuprofen and ice pack it is tolerable.

General malaise after this episode, symptoms come and go since then.  On April 7th, S/S resumed,  fell out of bed that morning since arms and legs felt minimal sensation and tingly, &#34;like I couldn&#39;t feel them&#34;. This went away after a short time and mobility returned. Ran fever (felt hot) first day of vaccination and off/on since then. Continues to not feel very good.  Referred to clinic for evaluation of symptoms.

Slight dizziness the following day intermittently but not too bad but dizzy while walking the dog midway through the  20 minute walk.  Woke fine the next day and the next. Saturday night it felt like I was coming down with something as I started running a small fever, felt burning hot, nausea( no puking), loss of appetite, dizziness, clouded head, stuffiness.  Thought it was allergies to the cat but I have never had such a reaction, ever, and I have been near this cat numerous times before.  Woke up in the morning feeling fine like nothing was wrong, except slight loss of appetite but was eating.  Have been fine since.

                                                I developed a low-grade fever nine hours after getting my shot on Wednesday morning. The next day, Thursday, I woke up with achy joints. Acetaminophen helped with the pain and the fever and so I felt better and was up and about by 3 pm that day. I was perfectly fine on Friday, but by Saturday late morning, I had a mild, migraine-like headache, like the feeling of having an elevated blood pressure. By late afternoon the headache started intensifying. I had a severe headache and great pressure in my head from Saturday night through Sunday night, and the acetaminophen wasn&#39;t helping much. By Monday morning, the pain had lessened, and I managed to get out of bed. It&#39;s been a week since I got vaccinated, and although I no longer have a headache, I am feeling woozy every now and then, like there is still pressure in my head.

                                                I received my shot at 10 a.m. on a Thursday morning. Around 6 p.m. on the evening of the shot, I began experiencing severe chills, and I threw up once. The chills lasted approximately four hours. In addition, I had an extreme headache. Once the chills subsided, I began sweating profusely through my clothes. I still had the headache. Around 2 a.m. in the morning, I was unable to stand or speak for about an hour.  Once I was finally able to move again, my skin - not my body, but my skin - hurt all over. I could not lay on my back due to extreme pain in my skin, particularly the skin on my back, shoulders and buttocks. Anything that touched my skin, no matter how light of a touch, felt like I was being severely bruised. My skin was in pain for about four hours. The sweating continued through the following Sunday morning.  I soaked through multiple sets of clothing and woke up every morning completely drenched. When I weighed myself Sunday morning, concerned about dehydration, the scale reflected a 4.2 pound weight loss over the course of less than three full days.  The headache lasted through Tuesday, April 14th, a total of five days with a strong headache. I am still experiencing some sweating but not like the initial round of sweating. Because my shot was given on a Thursday, I only missed one full day of work. However, had the shot been given at the beginning of the week, I am confident that I would have missed at least three full days, it was so debilitating.

                                                The night after the night of my vaccine I had a tightening of my whole left side, from my eye, down my neck, into my shoulder and chest and down left arm.  Then I started to get shooting pain all around my shoulder blades.  I brushed it off thinking that most people had complaints of feeling pain or sick the few days after their vaccines and then they said it went away.  Mine never went away.  After about 5 days it really started to worry me.  The pain was very intense- unbearable even- and i couldnt move my left arm or lie back in any way without incredible pain.  I called urgent care and they told me I could come in if the pain was bad but that maybe I wanted to see my regular physician to see what was going on.  I made an appointment with my doctor but it wasn?t until the end of the next week.  After 8 days, I couldn?t take it anymore.  I went to urgent care- they did an EKG and a chest xray and said all was normal.  They gave me an anti-inflammatory (naproxen) and a muscle relaxer. They took blood and the only thing they noted to me was that I should have my doctor check my platelette count.  They told me they thought it must be muscular.  I went home.  Neither of those medications seemed to help.  The pain was less in the day when I was moving around, but towards the end of the day it was getting so bad (still is) that I can?t sleep or get comfortable.  My doctor did blood work and couldn?t seem to find the source of what was going on with me either.  She prescribed me a new anti-inflammatory (meloxicam), a new muscle relaxer (cyclobenzaprine) and a pain killer (hydrocodone acetamin).  Sometimes those medications help- they knock me out- but when I wake up I feel the same.  I can?t take them in the day because they make me too loopy and tired.  I don?t know what is wrong. I can?t seem to get answers and  nobody can figure it out.  It is definitely my left side. I feel it in ky head, my chest, my shoulder and down my left arm and it has been almost 5 weeks.  It seems to be getting worse not better.  Looking for help or direction please

                                                The night of the vaccination (3/8), my body felt very hot (not fever) like it was going to catch on fire.  I took Tylenol to be safe and went to bed taking it as a sign that the vaccine was working.  I thought I was mostly over the next day, but four days later on 3/12, I started bleeding only two weeks after my last period, and the it was quite different than usual - very fresh blood and lots of it.  This continued for 15 days at time with very heavy flow - I bleed non-stop, and I worried that I was going to bleed to death.  The worst adverse effect happened 10 days after the vaccination on 3/18.  Out of blue without anything unusual, I started feeling very dizzy, nausea, and vomiting.  After much vomiting, nausea stopped, but the dizziness just got so bad, I couldn&#39;t move or even keep my eyes open (things were spinning even with my eyes closed).  I couldn&#39;t even stand up by myself.  This most horrible severe vertigo lasted two and got gradually better.  It took about 5 days before I felt safe enough to be alone by myself.  During this time, I had a excruciating headache on my left side.  It was so bad, I quickly took some painkillers which knock me out for a day.  The important thing is that I don&#39;t ever get headaches; this is the first one I had aside from one I had when going through IVF more than a decade ago.

When I got up from sitting to walk to the bathroom, my legs were wobbly as if I was going to fall.  I also developed a severe headache that lasted 3 days.  The black-outs ended after 12 hours.  Then Tuesday-Friday I had the &#34;expected&#34; feel like the flu hit me.

                                                Immediately after shot ...probably within 10 minutes or so I had vasodilation of my sinuses &amp; headache. It came together &amp; was quick like feeling inside of my nose swell &amp; slight headache. I WAS VACCINATED WITH MY DAUGHTER 18 YRS OLD WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES AND SON 20 WITH PRIOR HISTORY OF DENGUE IN PHILIPPINES. At night as it was getting dark,severe symptoms hit us at home all around the same time. Severe excruciating pain in the back of our head and it ran down into our necks &amp; jaw. I have had migraines &amp; it was worse pain in the back of the head. My son said it felt like dengue when he spent a week in the hospital,which comes with low platelets count. To me it felt like when I had infection in my left mound after double mastectomy and spent five days in hospital hooked to Ivs with 2 antibiotics &amp; they thought I had staff &amp; going septic. I had horrible headache with that. My daughter reacted the worse,she was crying with head pain &amp; shivering non-stop &amp; her body aches hit all over first. She slept with a hot pad on her head &amp; had ringing in the ears &amp; if she tried to get up she heard rushing water sound in ears &amp; felt like going to pass out. My body aches hit as I was trying to get strength to drive to ER if needs be,but if felt like crippling arthritis in arms wrists jaw legs knees &amp; ankles. I slept with hit pad on my head &amp; would move it to joints. Really none of us slept. Son had body aches all night too. Bad headache in back of head for all of us. Took 2 arthritis tylenil. All had stomach aches. Yesterday I was spinning &amp; severely dizzy. We are fatigued &amp; barely moving.

By the time I got parked, I started to feel dizzy.  I was afraid to tell anyone because I didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital.  At first, I felt extremely dizzy so that I would not have driven if I had been allowed.  Then, My heart then started to race for about 5 minutes before it started to calm down.  The person who gave me my shot wrote on my paper on my dashboard that I had to sit for 20 minutes after my shot.   I sat there for the whole 20 minutes and by the time I left, I felt much better, but it scared me it a bit.  I was told to beep my horn if I had a reaction, but I was afraid too.  I sat in my truck and waited to see if it got better or worse.  It did get better.  I was told by friends that I should report it so I am. I have been fine this week since that happened after the vaccination, without any dizziness or heart racing.  But, I am having pain in my left leg and I&#39;m a little worried about that because people are reporting blood clots.  I think I have a vein that is bad in that leg, although I have never been diagnosed with it.   That area has caused me pain in the past but I am so used to it that I normally just ignore it.  There&#39;s just a spot on my left thigh that hurts where I think the veins are bad.  Since the vaccination, I have had more pain in that area.  I don&#39;t know if I need to be concerned with that.  I have been trying to wait that out too.

I went to the ER because I have pre-syncopal episodes and also started to experience abdominal pain with diarrhea. At the ER, lab work was performed,  as well as a CT scan of the chest and an ultrasound of the abdomen. I feel fatigued and dizzy throughout the days.

When I got parked, within minutes, I got extremely dizzy and then my heart started to race.  I didn&#39;t report it to the military men there because I didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital because I have no health insurance.  I reported this in a previous form but you said I had missing information and gave me no way to update the lot number of the vaccine in your missing information email.  Also, I tried to give blood last night and I was denied due to low hemoglobin.  I have never been told that I had low hemoglobin in my life.  I&#34;m a healthy 173 pound, 5&#39;3&#39;&#39; woman who tracks her diet via my fitness pal.  I walk 3-5 miles a day and yesterday I consumed 113 grams of protien 116 percent of the daily recommended iron intake.

Weakness the whole of next day and then was ok after that. Happened  approx 3 weeks after first dose. Also was already suffering from severe pinched nerve in neck (this came on suddenly a week or so after the vaccination.. no accident or injury,  not sure if anything to do with vaccine) and was taking pain killers.

                                                With autoimmune issues - I was unaware that getting this shot would throw my body into a severe flare up.   by 8 pm on the day of the shot - continuing for 3 days - I had an extreme PSA flare up in which my joints all swelled, could barely move, terrible pain widespread throughout my body.  Had I known that people with automimmune diseases may end up with a severe flare due to the vacccination - I would have opted to NOT get the vaccine.  It is my understanding that the test groups did not include people with the autoimmune diseases.   In addition to the severe autoimmune flare up - since that has resolved, I have had an upper respiratiory cold - runny nose, sneezing, now coughing and congestion every since.  So once past the 3 days of flare, I have had now 6 days of cold type symptoms that nothing seems to help - no over the counter cold or sinus medicines are helping at all.

                                                Within 5 minutes from receiving my J&amp;J vaccine, I went to sit down and I started feeling very hot in my body. My heart started to race, had chest discomfort and had trouble breathing, my trachea closed up, had blurry vision and pain in my chest. I felt like I could not breathe and when the nurse came over to ask me I could not speak to her, I went into a shock and I was placed on the floor and I could not hear anything nor could open my eyes, from my hips down to my feet I could not feel anything, my legs went completely numb and I had a syncope. What I was told from the nurse that I was given an Epi-pen to help with my reaction. When I came back my body was having convulsions, felt my head spinning, had pain in my chest that so very intense and the nurse got me up and took me to a nearby ambulance and the EMT staff placed like a heart monitor because my heart was racing super fast. I also felt heaviness in my chest and inside the ambulance I was given two injections on my left arm and when I slowly started coming back, I was already at the hospital. I was at the hospital from 2pm to 4:30pm more less being monitored.  At the hospital x-ray of the chest was performed as well as lab work and I was discharged home. When I got home, I still did not feel good, I felt heaviness to my chest, still have trouble breathing and get chills during the night. I also could not stand up and have a nerve sensation to my body and the chest pain to my left side is still very present. I have blurry vision, dizziness, headaches, and my heart-beat continues to race very fast.  I get headaches, have abdominal pain and I peed blood few times then that&#39;s when I was able to pee, my abdominal pain was painful like having a baby. On Friday 04-08-2021, I again went to the hospital because I had fallen to the floor on my kitchen floor and my daughter took me to the hospital. I let the nurse staff know that I still have continued chest pain and pressure, difficulty breathing and headaches, dizziness and they monitored and gave me three pills as medication. I was discharged home about 5pm with a referral to see a neurologist due to my chest pain, blurry vision, dizziness and fever which I had these past three weeks. I do not know why I felt all these symptoms after my J&amp;J vaccine.

                                                I had dizziness for the majority of the day Saturday and Sunday.  I was fatigued, but made myself stay awake up the whole day Saturday.  I  had a very weird dream Saturday night and woke up very tired Sunday morning around 8 am. I went back to bed 11:15 am and slept until 1:30.  The dizziness lasted the rest of Sunday.  I have only slept for 5 hours between Sunday night and today (Tuesday March 9th).

                                                After the vaccination, I felt a little dizzy waiting in the parking lot and had a sore arm, but felt fine otherwise.  (12:00-1:00 pm)  After returning home, I felt increasingly tired and warm.  I laid down  and took my temperature after walking the dog around 3:00 pm.  My temperature read 99 degrees.   I drank a lot of pedialyte to hydrate.  Throughout the afternoon, I felt sluggish and the glands seemed to swell up on the side of my neck. I also got a headache.   My temperature dropped down to 98.7 before I went to bed, but this morning, my glands under my jawline are a bit more swollen and I still have a slight temperature; 98.9 degrees.  My eyelids are puffy and I feel a little feverish, but it is tolerable.

I did go to work the day after my vaccine, but was exhausted and went home and slept for the rest of the night.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Woke up at 1:20 am, with chills, shaking, shivering, dizzy.  Hard to get up to get an extra blanket beside the bed.  About 5 minutes of teeth chattering and shaking while trying to warm up under extra blankets.  Then about 20minutes of general cold discomfort (shaking stopped).    Then woke up with a headache this morning. No other symptoms - no rashes, no muscle pain, etc.

A few hours later, I had a 101 fever, chills, stronger fatigue, strong headache, muscle aches. Around 6pm, I began vomiting continuously. I spoke with an advice nurse and she told me to go to the emergency room. I continued to vomit until about 11:30pm, I was weak and felt like passing out a few times. Later in the evening, I took a Tylenol and finally went to sleep. On April 2nd (day after shot), I woke up with fatigue and headache, but fever was gone and I no longer vomited. I took another Tylenol and headache went away.

                                                I received my vaccine about 3pm Sat. April 3rd. About an hour or so later I started to feel ?run down? but nothing major. At 9pm I began getting chills but did not feel feverish. By 9:15 my body was aggressively trembling. Even my teeth were chattering. I could not control the shaking. I put many layers of blankets on me and turned my heat up to 80 in an effort to get warm. At some point I dozed off. I woke up at 12:30am and had a fever of a little over 101 degrees.  I fell asleep about 3am, still aggressively shaking.  I woke up at 9am (April 4th) and my head was throbbing. My fever was now 102.2. Also, every muscle in my back and shoulders ached. I sat up because I needed to get to the kitchen for some water. Once I stood up, my body felt like it was weighed down by heavy sandbags. I could barely walk to my kitchen and back. I went back to bed and covered up in massive blankets and tried to stay still. I did not take any pain reliever because I was too nervous to.  I never had any nausea but smells bothered me and I had no appetite. My fever stayed at 102.2 until I went to sleep (around 10pm).  Monday (April 5th) I still had chills but much milder. My temp was just over 101 all day. My head felt better but my muscles still hurt. By late evening (10pm) my fever was just over 99 degrees. I was feeling better and I no longer had chills.  Tuesday (April 6th) I woke up fever free. I felt mostly normal again except for my muscle aches.  Today is Friday (April 9th) and I continue to have muscle aches. The worst of it is in my lower back and it?s pretty severe. It feels like I lifted heavy weights with my lower back muscles. I have not been seen by a Doctor yet as I have no insurance. I?m not sure if I need to or not.   I wanted to contact you because I am a healthy person and what I experienced was BRUTAL. I have NO IDEA how a frail or vulnerable person could go through what I went through. Also, people need to know that they may have to take time off of work to deal with these side effects.

Muscle aches and headache also began about that time.  Went to sleep.  Around 1:30 woke up with nausea and sweaty chills.  Walking to the bathroom was difficult due to extreme fatigue.  Fever measured at 103 degrees.  Took Tylenol.  Nausea resolved by 7am 4/10, but had no appetite. Fatigue throughout day (4/10) - slept most of the day.  As of 7am on 4/11, mostly better.  Remaining symptoms are a lingering headache, moderate fatigue, and vaccine site muscle soreness.  Perhaps some brain fog, as this form seems challenging and it shouldn&#39;t. Note:  I had had little sleep the week prior to the vaccine, which may have affected my reaction.

                                                Anaphylaxis reaction which began immediately upon injection at 2:45Pm (roughly) into arm with wide spread hives covering the entire right arm and spread to left arm right leg. Head and neck, face became numb and I felt like I was going to pass out. Neck numbness/swelling moved to front of neck within five minutes. Itching of left leg. Was able to maintain consciousness but was very out of it. Possibly from lack of oxygen when neck and head swelled. Began to lose ability to recite address or remember address by the time was placed in paramedic van. Paramedic put IV in hand. Paramedics administered ephedrine, Benadryl, prednisone and reaction subsided. Was taken directly to hospital arrived there for monitoring by 3:15 Pm . Felt much better at hospital.  Had one wave/head rush where it felt like the reaction was starting again and may pass out but that subsided and they continued to monitor. Had a few waves of nausea which did not last long. The IV placed in hand by paramedic was infiltrated so attempts at giving fluids failed and it was never corrected at hospital. After 2 hours of monitoring I was told to go home and given a prescription for steroids. I was asked to monitor for the remainder of the night for any trouble breathing. Night sleep was not good waking often with one occasion of wheezing which subsided after taking Benadryl. Continue to monitor.

                                                I was dizzy and could not keep my balance or walk.  I was having chest pains and felt a heavy feeling in my chest.  My husband took me to the ER. They ran blood work and did a CT Scan and chest x-ay.  I told the ER that I had the covid vaccination the Tuesday prior but they said I would have already had symptoms.  They didn&#39;t ask which vaccination.  They said they thought I had vertigo and gave me Antivert.   They said I should follow up with an ENT, Cardiologist and Gastroenterologist.  When I went for the follow-u p with a Cardiologist, they scheduled a stress test (May 21st) and an Echocardiogram ( May 11th).  The Gastro doctor wants a endoscopic and colonoscopy but wont schedule until I have clearance from the Cardiologist.

Around 6:00pm the same day I received vaccine, I started getting chills and strong aches in my back and legs. I felt very dizzy, lightheaded and sleepy. Chills were gone by the next morning, but aches and sleepiness continued for 4 days. Dizziness and lightheadedness continues til now. A little over a week after vaccination, I had random bruising on my legs on the same side I received vaccine. My lymph nodes were visibly swollen and my breasts felt extremely tender. Bruises are still healing, but lymph nodes and breasts seem relatively normal now, exactly 3 weeks after initial vaccination

Lasted approximately 4 hours. Extreme dizziness for approximately 2-3 minutes while sitting still at 4 hour mark - resolved with rest except arm pain, which lessened slightly over the first hour but remained unresolved after 4 hours.  Within 30 minutes post injection - redness, heat, and swelling at injection site.   After injection (approximately 12-13 hours post injection) - Fever (100-101.7 consistently over 3 days), extreme fatigue, headache, muscle aches/joint pain, severe chills.

                                                Right after the dose I got an immediate headache, dizzy and light headed. About an hour later I became nauseous and my face became very flush red and hot. I went to bed and woke up feeling like I got hit by a truck and was very tired with a sore arm. By the next day I was better. The following week I began with a red hot circle on my arm where the shot was given, it had a ring around it. That lasted for about a week. I then started to get stinging sensations in that part of my arm like I was being stung by a bee. These lasted for about 2 days. I then started getting muscle rolls/spasms in the same spot on that arm. They lasted about 3 days. I then started having pain in that arm like I had just gotten the shot and as I was rubbing it, I noticed a large indent in my arm. I went to the doctor, and they said they had no idea why it happened but if I get more symptoms to come back. The doc appt was on 4/12/21. It has been over a month of these side effects. Doctor not sure if it will be a permanent disfigure.

Then about noon took prescription migraine medication. Slept until 4 pm. Headache less severe until 8 p.m that I took again migraine prescribed medication and slept until 11 am on 4/5/21. Headache started decreasing and felt ok again to take Tylenol. Saturday 10 and Sunday 11 Severe headache again. Medication worked only late (about 5pm) on Sunday 11 when headache started decreasing and I was able to sleep the night. Wednesday 14th, left lower leg and uncle area swollen (never before I had a swollen leg or foot) and right leg 3 red spots near my uncle (they kind of look like a mosquito bite but a little bigger). Today the red spots look smaller but I have bruises on both of my legs lower and upper sections (I been working in the garden so I might have bumped into things perhaps) I thought I just report this symptoms so you can add data to your system.

After about an hour, it completely subsided and I didn&#39;t feel dizziness anymore. I did not receive any treatment for this.  Also, on the fourth day after vaccination (April 13), I felt pressure/tightness in my chest. Because the blood clot cases had been publicized, I called my doctor, who advised me to go to the emergency room of our local hospital. They gave me an EKG, which looked fine, and said they thought the tightness might be related to my asthma (although that is not a symptom I have ever felt with my asthma before, which usually manifests as slight wheezing). The chest tightness lasted about two days and then went away completely without treatment.

                                                Reported adverse effects to J&amp;J after a horrible day/night from severe allergic reaction. We were 5 hrs from home, on a weekend, could not get vaccines in our county. Drove to  County. After the 15 min when walking out of the building noticed strong metallic taste in mouth (no fillings), thought odd. Then while driving noticed red blemishes/rash on neck, swelling of my tongue. Once arrived at hotel (too far to drive back home and not feeling well), noticed red rash on front of neck, ear lobes bright red, hot to the touch and swollen. Vertigo and low fever came on along with elevated heart rate. These lasted all Saturday into Sunday. Didn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t sleep Saturday night, Sunday morning rash on face with heart rate BPM elevated all day with fever and bad vertigo. All these symptoms continued all week with exception to the rash and swollen tongue those subsided late Sunday. The vertigo, fevers, skin sensitivity and complete fatigue along with bump at injection site persisted even to today.

                                                Within 6 hours after the vaccination, I experienced significant chills, then high fever, then body aches, then intense nausea. These symptoms were as expected and seemed to subside within 48 hours. However, the nausea did not subside and for the following 2 weeks, I experienced significant &#39;waves&#39; of nausea brought on by various factors such as car/plane (motion sickness), sun exposure (75 degrees on a beach for 20 minutes), various foods, etc.   Approximately one week after the vaccination, I had several glasses of red wine (4 glasses within an 8 hour time period). I am not a big drinker, so this amount caused me to feel intoxicated but not enough to be completely inebriated. I slept for 6 hours and woke up feeling &#39;drunk&#39;- extremely dizzy and nauseous. I proceeded to vomit non-stop (approximately 7 times) over the following 6 hours and could not get the nausea under control. In fact, I had to have a physician prescribe Zofran to stop the dizziness and nausea or else I was going to need fluids administered. This is extremely unusual for me. It felt like the nausea I had been feeling from the vaccine had somehow been intensified 10-fold because of the wine. The Zofran helped immensely however, the nausea (slight at this point- back down to what it was prior to the alcohol episode) continued to persist for another two weeks and a half weeks. A few days ago, it felt like I &#39;turned the corner&#39;.  I am now three weeks out from the vaccination and the nausea is almost gone (90% gone).

                                                By 6pm I noticed something wasn?t right. I could t get warm, even when sitting in the sunshine. By 9pm the chills had turned to fever. My temperature at 9pm was 101.2F.  I also had a headache and started to feel a bit shaky.  By 10pm I had body aches and was in bed with 3 blankets on me and still could not get warm. My temp was 102.7 at 10pm. I tried to sleep. At midnight I awoke to a fever of 104.8 and could only cry. The worst body aches, headache, racing heart and dizziness, nausea and vomiting (after additional aspirin were taken to relieve the fever). I was very weak in an alarmingly rapid period. I stayed in this condition until approximately 6:30am on 4/26. At 7am my temp was 102.5 and I found it hard to make it back and forth to the bathroom, due to dizziness and weakness. By noon, the temp was back up to 103.1 and I could barely cry, as I suspected I was then  close to dehydration. I focused on hydration and slept as much as possible. The fever slowly came down to its current 100.4 at 11pm on 4/27.  This has been an alarming reaction to a vaccine. I have had serum sickness previously, so maybe that is a factor that should also be considered. I hope this is helpful.

                                                About 10-11 hours after receiving the vaccine began to have severe body aches and 102 fever.   Fever subsided but extreme fatigue and body aches for two full days following the vaccine.  Two days after the vaccine I began to have sharp intermittent pains in my head and lost my balance and had trouble walking for about two hours.  I took Advil for the fever and the pains in head and this seemed to help with both.  Three days after the vaccine I am feeling less fatigue and body aches have improved.

                                                Vaccination was 10:30 am.  Around 6:30 pm, my right knee started to throb.  I took an epsom salt bath, where my upper back started to hurt.  I went to sleep around 8:00.  I woke up around 10 pm unable to open my eyes all the way.  I believe they were swollen nearly shut.  I could see a slit of light coming in from outside.  I couldn&#39;t move my left hand at all (left arm is where I received vaccination).  I held it up to the outside light, and it was swollen.  The light coming in from outside hurt my eyes.  I couldn&#39;t see enough to call for help.  Around 1:30 a.m., the swelling went down enough for me to open my eyes.  I have never seen them look so bloodshot.  It was scary.  I could move my hand again as well.  I spent next day in bed resting.   Monday, I noticed a small rash on my right shoulder.  I went to work and was there about 20 minutes before I started feeling hot and dizzy.  I went home and spent the day in bed.   I was able to go to work the next day, Tuesday, without problem.  One week after vaccination, the rash on my shoulder went away, but a small rash broke out on my right shin.  This one was deeper.  One week later, there are just a couple of small scabs left in the spot on my shin.  I feel my energy level is close to normal.

My fever started going down on Friday however I was barely able to get out of bed Friday but forced myself to a few times. I was dizzy or light neaded all of these days including now which is Sunday.  I am still tired/depressed and not back to normal even now.

After approximately 5 more minutes, her son stated that he would like us to contact EMS, and they were contacted at that point. When EMS arrived, they were directed to the patient and allowed to monitor the patient for worsening condition. The patient&#39;s condition resolved, and EMS was no longer needed. The patient stated to the pharmacy that she was feeling  better and would seek medical attention later if she experienced more symptoms and then left the store.

I became so dizzy, lightheaded that 2 people had to hold me up and escorted me (as I slouched) to a tented cot in the area. I felt I drifted back and forth into a black out state for about 20 minutes.

I headed home around 4 pm and started to feel warm, but thought it was the sun. Around 5:15 I got the chills, very bad. So bad my jaws were shaking. I tried to use a heating blanket to get warm, but was very miserable. About an hour later I started running a fever that kept going up. My ears started to hurt and the ringing was really bad. By 8:30 my fever had spiked to 102 and I was so nauseous I had a hard time moving around, I almost used the bathroom on myself twice. Started burning up but still unable to move, I went outside to cool down and had a family member take me to the urgent care. They said my arm was swollen from the injection site and that everything was normal and that it was a good thing I was having these experiences because it means the vaccine was working.  Gave me nausea medicine and aspirin and sent me home. I was unable to sleep from all the pain in my body and just laid here in pain starting to get really hot. Woke up around 4 soaking wet where I broke the fever and then continued to have a mild fever all day Sunday, April 11, with mild sweats on and off when my body would get too hot. Today just been trying to move around but very tired and exhausted. Had hard time sitting up to do some work at the table, so been laying down most of the day.

Within an hour the right side of my face and ear started to hurt, almost like it felt burnt, The nerve endings was super sensitive and has still not gone away. That night I didn&#39;t feel good, tired and out of it. On the third day I woke up with a rash on various parts of my body and moved to my eye lids as well. I called for a telehealth, and asked for a low dose steroid and he said not because I would &#34;disrupt my immune response&#34;.  I&#39;m still having issues.

                                                Friday: Received vaccine at 9am. Began feeling like cheeks were warm/flushed by early afternoon. By 5-6pm was lethargic and  had chills, but no fever. Chills continued through the night and were better but not gone by morning. Saturday: Awakened with headache. Headache and fatigue improved throughout the day. Sunday: headache was mostly gone, but still feeling low-energy and light headed after a period of activity. Monday: Felt much better in the morning, but tried standing at my desk after lunch and felt moments of light-headedness, and felt low-energy. Tried to weight train at 6pm and broke out in sweat with minimal exertion. Tuesday - I still don&#39;t feel quite right - energy level is still less than normal, with occasional moments of light headedness.

These symptoms lasted without break for approximately 4 days/nights at which it tapered off.  Also, on the morning of Sunday 4/11/21 I  noticed a vein that seemed to &#39;inflate&#39; on my Left upper forehead and pulsed for a few minutes and then subsided with the feeling of a slight headache mostly on the Left side.

                                                Day of vaccine:  within a few hours of receiving the vaccine (around 12:00pm or 1:00pm), I developed a headache, body aches, pain at the injection site, and brain fog.  The brain fog was such that I could no longer work, so I laid down.  Late in the afternoon (around 4:00pm), I developed numbness and tingling in my finder tips.  This continued to get worse, particularly when walking around, so I continued to rest.  Around 9:00pm, I was also getting dizzy when walking.  I went to bed, and awoke symptom-free in the morning.  Treatment included bed rest, ibuprofen, applied heat, and increased fluid intake.  Day after vaccine: I had the first HSV-2 outbreak I&#39;ve had in 5 years.

                                                Lady had vaccine, was told it was Janssen but lot # is Moderna.  She got the vaccine, the night of the vaccine around 5:30 she got a raging headache (she does get reactions to most vaccines).  She took Tylenol and her arm did hurt.  The next day she was still really hurting, her headache was really, really bad, and it stayed until Sunday.  Then on Sunday she was ok.  On Monday when she went to work and her right arm went limp, and while she was walking her right leg gave way and almost fell, grabbed hold and steadied herself.  The raging headache/migraine came back and she started getting nauseous, her lower back hurt, her upper neck area hurt like somebody was pounding her neck.  Then she got diarrhea and really really tired on Monday and Tuesday and also had loss of appetite.  Then yesterday 4/13/201 she just had the headache and a sound in her ear, went to UC and got drops for it.  Her temperature was 96.5, and her normal is 98.7, and was told that she was really cold.  Her PB was really high and the doctor took it again but it was not as high, attributed it to anxiety.  Last night the lower abdomen pain started, feeling like she was getting her period which she has not had in over a year.  She saw a little blood on her panty liner, and was thinking she was going to have a period, but the pain is excruciating in her lower abdomen.   She has also taken Tylenol off and on for her symptoms, and feels like she is cramping.     She is having hot/cold flashes as well, and has not had these issues from menopause.

Patient is an avid runner who runs three to four times week. Today (4/15/21), patient developed tachycardia in the high 180s ten minutes into her run. She then stopped running and started walking on flat surface for 30 minutes in hopes to slow down her heart rate. However, after 30 minutes of walking her heart rate remained in the 185 to 205 beats per minutes. The tachycardia lasted for one hour since she stopped running. She then came to the ED for check ups.

I also had fatigue, headache, metallic taste in month and dizziness.  I felt awful.  I began to feel better after about 2 1/2 days.  I still have an occasional headache (not severe or constant), but it seems more allergy related (stuffy nose and drainage).  I would not take the vaccine again because I  thought my response was too strong.  I thought I would provide this information given the pause of the vaccine, so you could gather additional information/feedback.

Since I got the vaccine, I&#39;ve been getting headaches, dizziness, nausea and hot flashes on my face.   On April 8th, I saw my primary. He believes it&#39;s related to my perimenopause changes. I also went to the ER had blood work and an MRI. No explanation of the results just that everything was ok.  My concern are the headaches. It feels  like pressure in my head. I never had these types of headaches prior to taking the vaccine.

The patient was at her local pharmacy and was waiting in chairs as instructed; then she walked to her vehicle and began to feel light-headed and lost consciousness. Her husband was with her and was able to administer life saving measures, the local pharmacist was able to administer an epi-pen to her right thigh. On 02-APR-2021, the patient stopped breathing and was then transported to the local ER(emergency room) where she was treated. She regained consciousness and had persistent emesis and the patient was kept in hospital for 24 hours before being discharged. The patient was hospitalized for one day.

The patient recovered from syncope/lost consciousness, and was recovering from light headed, vomiting/persistent emesis, and anaphylactic reaction, stopped breathing. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused/ Prolonged, and Life Threatening).; Sender&#39;s Comments: v0 A 52-year-old female patient with the past medical history remarkable for anaphylaxis to peanuts experienced anaphylactic reaction the same day the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Ad26.COV2 was administered. The patient began to feel light-headed and lost consciousness, an epi-pen was administered. The next day the patient stopped breathing and was treated in the local ER (emergency room). Later she had persistent emesis. Given the close temporal relationship and history of anaphylaxis to peanuts the events are considered related.

My anxiety level is up and I have had a feeling of crawling in my back. The headaches last all day and they are like a tight band headache. They were coming back daily. Tylenol helps relieve the pain.  The nausea and dizziness lasted about one week. After four weeks I am still getting the headaches, but they are less frequent this week. The feeling of crawling in my back started after three weeks and it is still happening two or three times a day. I have seen a Neurologist.

                                                The day after I received the vaccin I experienced an extreme tension in my two eyes that I still have now but not as intense. My left eye is the most affected - The blood flows really fast in the eye and it is pulsing. I don&#39;t have the sensation every day now but still on and off. Both of my eyes feel tension not as much as it was at the beginning but still experiencing symptoms of pressure and pulsions. It feels like I am going to have an ophthalmic migraine. My eyes doesn&#39;t feel right either. Overall, I felt weak, highlighted and it felt like if I was experiencing  feeling of &#34;dissociation&#34; - caused I think by my sight being affected.  I couldn&#39;t do a lot as my energy was very low and it felt that my oxygen wasn&#39;t at its maximum. Every small activity required a lot of energy and I could barely walk around my block. It affected my work and I couldn&#39;t teach at the end of that first week. I wasn&#39;t feeling good. I went to my doctor on Monday, April 12th as I was concerned about blood clot or other neurological and pulmonary issues. My Doctor examined me and listened to me and concluded that the sides effects were taking longer than the average to go away. The following day I woke up reading about the blood clots due to J&amp;J vaccin. I called back my doctor and we did a blood test. It came back negative and I got my eyes checked by my ophthalmologist too, and he didn&#39;t see anything.

It had also swelled considerably.  I could not lift my arm at that point.  At approximately 10:00 pm I went to the hospital.  I was given an Ultrasound on left arm and shoulder to check for blood clots which was negative.  I was also given an Xray on left shoulder to check for bone abnormalities which was negative.  I was diagnosed with &#34;COVID shoulder&#34;, released and given pain medication.  Was told to follow up with family practitioner.  Went to Dr. on Tuesday, April 27, 2021 who confirmed the diagnosis.  Blood was taken which showed elevated white blood cells.

                                                About 3 minutes after receiving the vaccine while the patient was waiting the recommended 15 minutes post-vaccination, the patient begain to experience symptoms of faintness. She tapped on our window to alert us but almost immediately began to fall out of her chair. Another patient being vaccinated at the time was able to catch the patient and support her head to keep it from hitting the ground. The patient was still alert, responsive, and in a sitting position on the ground when I reached her moments later. The patient shortly collapsed all the way to the ground; we were still able to support her head. We called 911. I rolled the patient to her back. I was able to find a pulse and was able to see the patient&#39;s chest rising with breaths. The patient still responded to verbal cues nodding that she could hear me. I removed her face covering to help ventilation. I checked the patient&#39;s blood pressure and it was within normal range. Within about 3 minutes the patient was considerably more alert. She asked for some water which we provided. Shortly thereafter she was able to stand with our assistance and return to her chair. EMS arrived and conducted an evaluation; they determined that she did not need to be transported to the hospital. The patient rested in her chair for approximately 15 minutes longer before departing.

                                                Had shot on Monday.  Horrible pain in arm at injection site that went up my neck to my head.  Sinuses flared up and ears started beeping.  Became dizzy and nauseous and had difficultly breathing.  Went to pass out due to blood pressure drop.  Had to breath in alcohol wipes and then both arms went into pain as if falling asleep only 100 times worse.  Could not moves my arms - hands were cramping.  Took 1 hour to get back to some normal to drive home. The next day/Tues my sinuses where still a little swollen along with a little bit of arm pain, nausea and fatigue.   Wed - Fri sinuses continued to be swollen then on Fri - Sun had coughing.  Following Mon was weaker and feeling low immune.  Tues ended up at doctor&#39;s office having gone into a sinus infection.  Was also experiencing shallow breathing in neck and chest.  Started Augmentin 875mg 2 x a day Tues - Fri.  Then Fri night went into a severe inflammation in my chest, throat and esophagus with difficulty to catch my breath and couldn&#39;t eat.  Sat reached out to document through EMR and was prescribed a Steroid (6 days) which I started on Sun morning.  Was very weak and took that whole week with full does of steroid to get back to normal breathing.  Finished Antibiotics (12 days worth) 2 days after completing the steroid which was now Sunday.  Then still had some sinus recovery where ear was beeping in and out for 2 more days.  By Wed of the 4th week things were returning to normal.  Total time to recover was exactly 4 weeks.

                                                This is my second report (same vaccine Johnson and Johnson on March 23 lot #1805031) because my symptoms are still present; my first report was on 04/07/2021. I currently have depression, tinnitus, fatigue, brain fog, sometimes I feel shaky on the inside, swaying at times, and dizziness/vertigo. I sent follow-up information for my first VAERS report via mail and a pdf document to VAERS webpage; I attempted to fax several times but it came back unsuccessful; I left a message for a representative to return my call and nobody called back. I want to make sure you get this information, hence this second report.  Additional Follow-up Information: Hospital Emergency Room visit on April 8, 2021: purple finger, racing heart, chest pain. EKG, body scan for blood clots, and blood panel.  Doctor video visit on April 16, 2021: chest pain, feeling horrible, shortness of breath, metallic taste in the mouth, tinnitus, insomnia, anxiety, and depression.  Doctor office visit on April 29, 2021: headache, dizziness, fatigue, brain fog, stress, depression, thirsty, pressure at temples and back of head and forehead, rocking, anxiety.

Then yesterday  morning was a little achy and by afternoon was miserable the next day she got really tired, joints hurting and had to take a nap.  She cancelled one of her appointments  she&#39;s a home health nurse and went to sleep and when she woke up her throat was swollen, hurting, labored swallowing and when she would drink her ears would pop, and her tongue was swollen but could breathe fine, and then it progressed to where she could not swallow at all.  She took two Benadryl&#39;s and went to rest, and she was not able to move and had to have help getting dressed.   Her joints are swollen, her hands are swollen, but her throat is not hurting like she was yesterday.

Did not sleep well much Friday night due to these symptoms.  Sudden pain in left side of my head about 40 min after the vaccine after I walked to the car and sat down after the 30 min wait. Pain starts as a slow dull ache, increases rather sharply, then goes away quickly. Have this pain several times or so yesterday and today even after taking ibuprofen.   Also pain in my neck with what feels like stress headaches with ibuprofen relieving it.

Took tylenol every 4-6 hours which helped only slightly.  Still felt all the same symptoms by next day as well as nauseous and light headed.  Symptoms started to improve by noon and pretty much resolved by that evening.  Total time of adverse symptoms about 24-28 hours.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  Approximately 7 hours after the shot, my body was in a continuous state of needing to stretch. It is like when you wake up in the morning and need to stretch - a whole body stretch- but this was continuous. Over and over and over, right after each other. It went on for many hours. Also, 40 hours after the shot, I noticed a body rash (it could have been there the previous day but I was in bed all day feeling horrible and didn&#39;t notice). I also have a rash on my sacrum area, and I could barely walk with the pain in my bones in that area. As the morning has progressed, I am feeling better in that area but it is still sore. It has been 40 hours after my vaccine and I am still not 100%. Aside from the horrible headache, chills and flu-like symptoms, these are the other side effects I thought need to be reported.

No treatments yet....but if still bad after this weekend, will seek medical help.  Left eye swelling started at 2pm today, with pain. the eye lid and the area around the left eye are painful and swollen. I have been using hot compresses.  Difficulty catching my breath today durning a morning walk. I have been walking for months on the same path and can hold a conversation, but today, I could barely walk and talk. Once I stopped talking I eventually was able to catch my breath, but we had to walk a much slower pace as well.

She went to sleep at 1130pm on the day she received her vaccine. At 4am the following morning, she woke up and her whole body was convulsing--the muscles in her arms and legs were shaking, her hands were balled into fists, and her jaw was clenched. She reported that her husband woke up and asked her if she was ok to which we was able to respond, but cannot remember what she said. She reports that her husband said the episode lasted 3-4 minutes, but that she felt like it lasted an hour. When the episode was over, she was spacey and confused. She did not get out of bed. 10 minutes later, a second episode occurred. This time her left arm and right leg began convulsing, but the rest of her body was unaffected. This episode lasted 2-3 minutes and then ended.

                                                Very painful injection! I felt this going in immediately. Probably 30 minutes after I also felt a little dizzy but I also have a chronic condition called vestibular migraine. I was fatigued later in the evening. Had full day on day after vax  because I already had things on my calendar but was dragging by the time I got home. Aches all over especially joints, head and injection site was warm to touch and somewhat swollen. Also started running fever one day after. Highest temp 101.9 . I also started having diarrhea, full on three days after. My taste and smell had been off since having covid in august, but I swear they are since taking vax. Today is Tuesday so I&#39;m now five days in and temps normal today. My body aches are also improved but my head is still a bit achy.

Continued to experience palpitations, dizziness and nausea throughout the afternoon. Within 2 hours, headache and extreme fatigue started and are still present 5 days later. Also experienced shortness of breath, worsening of asthma symptoms and lightheadedness. Woke up on the 5th morning with delayed reaction at injection site. No visible rash or bruise at this time, but hard lump at site and entire upper arm feels very bruised and sore to the point that it hurts to lift the arm. Ibuprofen is all I have taken for it. Will see a doctor if not improved in the next two days.

A few minutes later I felt difficulty breathing and realized that my throat was swelling.  My heart began to race, but I cannot say if that was a result of the other symptoms I was experiencing.   The dizziness and weakness lasted for about 2 hours. The difficulty breathing and swollen throat eased after about 7 hours.  Just as I thought that I was feeling better, a fever set in around 11pm along with the chills, joint aches and pains, and general malaise. These flu-like symptoms lasted for roughly 36 hours.

                                                Approximately 7-8 hours following injection I became suddenly ill with chills, fatigue, muscle aches and nausea.  For the next 24 hours I pretty much was bedridden.  It has been just a bit over 2 weeks since my vaccination and I am still struggling with fatigue and muscle (or joint) pain.  I have been to the doctor and she ruled out any of the blood clotting issues.  She also did blood work and everything came back normal.  If I do to much at one time I become very achy in my neck, shoulders, lower back.  It is difficult to fully raise my arms with out pain and discomfort.  I also become very fatigued.  I?m unsure if it?s muscle pain, nerve or joint pain.  I?m a very active person so this is not the norm for me.

                                                after receiving shot, I waited 30 min, because I had bells palsy in the past  (about 16 years ago) it was an extra pre caution, approximately an hour later I felt slight dizziness which was not a concern for me  and passed quickly.  approx 2 or so hours later i got a bad stomach cramp similar to a bad menstral cramp however I am menopausal so this was unusual.  I believe it happened 2 or 3 times, that afternoon and maybe once the following day but never again.  The next day after my vaccine 04/04 I experienced a very low fever, came and went most bothersome was the chill and tiredness i felt by evening,  by 04/05 every symptom was gone just a bit of sore arm.  I was away on vacation when I heard the news about the pause and was concerned because I had stomach cramps .  These cramps were just after the shot and came and went quickly so maybe not much of an issue.  Upon return from my vacation last night, I blew my nose and there was blood in my right nostril.  it was not a flowing blood and I think it may have just been caused by the dry air in the airplane?  it was approximately 5.5 hr flight.  Maybe not related but thought I would mention it.

By the end of that week, I was feeling like a truck hit me. As of Monday April 5, I couldn&#39;t work. Dizziness and light headedness began. I want getting any better. Better vaccine I felt amazing, but I started to feel like death. I called my primary Dr first who ran bloodwork, then Dr took over from there.  The vaccine dumped my TSH levels fast, I had hit 30 and with having a total Thyroidectomy my levels need to be about 167 for me to feel my best. I&#39;ve been stable for quite some time. I have had a drop before in the past but never felt so lathargic and sick as I have this time. I&#39;m returning to work finally Monday May 3. It&#39;s been a long haul , getting better, and honestly I was scared to get the vaccine not knowing how my system would react due to having autoimmune diseases. I guess I found out the hard way.

                                                Patient received the COVID vaccine in the RA and immediately complained of the pain and stated she felt dizzy, faint, and lightheaded. She said she thought the needle was still in the arm until she felt the bandaid go on and realized it wasn&#39;t. She said she felt nauseous, and slouched down in her seat. I went to get a trash can just in case she got sick and she immediately got out of the chair and said she needed to lie down on the floor. We placed her on the pharmacy floor and she said she was having a hard time breathing and her head &#34;felt funny and weird&#34;. I retrieved the EpiPen but she said she never had one and didn&#39;t want to get it yet. She was conscious the whole time and appeared to be hyperventilating so we never administered the Epipen. She said her fingers were tingly and requested we call the paramedics so we did. They arrived very timely and took over. They took her BP and it was fine. They asked if she wanted to go to the hospital and she said no. She stated she was starting to feel better, she could breath more easily. She  eventually was able to sit up and the paramedics got her to call her son to come pick her up and the paramedics walked her out of the store to meet him.

                                                Left upper arm, shoulder and neck became very achy. I began to experience chills without a fever around 8:00 pm. Around 11:00pm, I began to feel nauseous. I wasn&#39;t able to sleep, my heart was racing. By 3:30 am I had vomited at least 5 times. Throughout the day on Monday, I was still very cold, nauseous (without vomiting) and somewhat lightheaded. It is now Tuesday and my stomach is still upset. I have not contacted my physician at this time. I have been treating myself with ginger ale, Pepto Bismol, saltines and rest. I&#39;m not 100%, but feeling much better.

                                                Administered vaccine at 12:40pm Pt during administration of vaccine started to pull away but full dose was administered, pt was nervous about the needle. After instructing pt to sit in the post vaccine chair for 15 minutes I noticed visible distress at around 12:50pm. I rushed to her aid and asked her how she was feeling and she reported feeling dizzy. I then helped her out of her chair onto the floor to ensure she would not fall and hit her head - told her to lay supine. I then asked my technician to give me the bp monitor. I then checked her bp and it was below 80/60. I informed her this could be contributing to her dizziness and then asked for consent to help raise her bp. She consented and then I told her I would be lifting her legs in the air to raise her BP. I held her legs in the air for 10 minutes or so and then reassessed her BP and it was 110/48. She started to feel better but reported feeling as if ants were all over her left arm which is where I gave her the vaccine. I assessed once again for angioedema, anaphylaxis, hives, redness, swelling, but didnt see anything. Since the pt was dizzy I did not offer her benadryl liquid but instead offered clairitin. The pt was merely having a panic attack post immunization and said she could swallow tablets and was feeling better. I gave her one clairitn tablet otc. She wanted to sit up so I assisted her to a sitting position while she was on the floor. She sat there for additional ten minutes then moved into a chair and was brought food by her husband because he said she did not have breakfast and thought that could be why she was dizzy. She was not a diabetic so I was not concerned about her BG. She said that this never happened in the past when I reviewed her PCQF form prior to giving her the vaccine. She has had zero history of syncope so this was rare for her. After an additional 10 minutes she had a bp reading of 98/60 and left the store feeling much better

                                                Patient was administered vaccine at approximately 8:03 am. Shortly after she stated that she did not feel well, that she felt kind of dizzy.  I asked her if she was feeling any better after a couple minutes and she said that she was not, that she felt like she was going to faint.  I proceeded to have the patient lie down on the ground with her feet propped up, this was at about 8:10am. I instructed one of the technicians to call for emergency services/emt; this was at about 8:15am. Ice packs were given to the patient to place around her neck, behind her neck, forehead, by her arm pits and on her stomach. I continued to assess her well-being. She never had any trouble breathing; she did not loose consciousness nor did her lips turn blue. She said she felt less dizzy but that she still did not feel very well. The emt arrived at about 8:30am. They moved the patient onto a stretcher and proceeded to take her to the emergency room.

Help responded and I came out of it, and proceeded to vomit 4-5 times.  Felt weak, dizzy, nauseous.  My mom came to drive me home.  Slept the rest of the morning and had some feeling of tightness in my chest in the late afternoon and evening.  Thursday morning when I woke up, my arm was sore but I felt mostly better (still a bit of tightness in the chest).  Did not seek medical attention at this time - just monitoring symptoms as of Thursday, 4/8/21.

I could hardly raise my head off of the pillow.  I was extremely sick for over 24 hours.  Four days later, I&#39;m still dizzy and light headed, no appetite and foggy.

As the night progressed I started having chills and the headache gotten worse.  I took a ibuprofen and went to bed. In the morning I woke up feeling very weak with excruciating pain in my joints and muscles and a chronic headache. I could not move around without holding on because I was disoriented. This went on until the  second day I woke up without the pain but still feeling weak in my legs and entire body.

                                                I was fine all day with no sore shoulder until 8:00 when I started getting a headache, feeling cold.   I kept getting more uncomfortable , colder and getting body shakes.  By 10:00 I could hardly walk to bed because of uncontrollable muscle shaking, jaw chattering, and was unable to get warm.  I took Advil then.  It took about an hour to stop shaking and warm up in bed with my husband.  I felt terrible for the next 2 1/2 days, just horrible, unable to function.  I slept a lot.

                                                Immediate reaction in right arm-it felt like my arm was on fire. The pharmacist gave the shot extremely high-almost in the shoulder and the reaction was intensely painful.   Starting about 6 days later, the soreness of the shot developed into not being able to raise that arm at all without pain.  Now, a month later, the pain is worse and is waking me up at night. The injection site is not sore, but the arm itself is not functional without pain. About 2 weeks after the shot, I started having a fuzzy feeling in my head (not painful) and ears.  I am extremely sensitive to sound and feel almost dizzy at times. My speech has been slurred and words are not coming to me easily. I am extremely tired and feel foggy.

Woke at 12:20 am with high temperature, severe shakes, extreme weakness and inability to walk without assistance due to shaking and weakness. Had extreme body aches and full blown migraine. Was too weak to call for help. Had Advil in nightstand and took several to help. Called doctor in the morning and was advised to rotate Advil and Tylenol. Was too weak to get out of bed all next day (Friday) and half of Saturday. Also experienced tightness in chest to where I had to start taking Albuterol (haven&#39;t taken that in years). Bad side effects and extreme weakness and total loss of energy lasted 3 days.  Persistent headache and tightness in chest lasted up to 7 days.. Horrible experience. I felt like I was poisoned.

                                                The day after the vaccine (Sunday, 3/21/21), I had severe leg pain--throbbing in both legs.  My legs felt warm to the touch.   I also had a severe headache all day and a feeling of disorientation like I couldn&#39;t focus or concentrate.  I felt light-headed and very tired.  There was swelling, redness, and pain at the injection site (my left arm) all the way down the left side of my body (under my arm and around my ribs).  I took Acetaminophen, but the pain persisted all day.  The pain in my legs was the worst symptom and it was so painful and uncomfortable that it was impossible to sleep that night.  I&#39;ve never felt anything like it. I was planning to go to an emergency clinic the next day if the pain continued.  I finally got to sleep in the morning  (Monday, 3/22/21) and slept for several hours.  When I woke up later that day (3/22/21), the pain was gone and I felt normal again.   I was still tired for the rest of the week and I continued to have swelling in my arm at the injection site, but otherwise, no other symptoms.  It took approximately 6 days for the pain and swelling in my arm to feel better.  I did not seek medical attention because the leg pain was gone within 24 hours, but I am concerned now and am wondering if there has been any permanent damage to my circulatory system or heart.  I have noticed that my pulse has been elevated for the last 3 weeks (as compared to normal).

Felt fine until Wednesday then broke out in hives and later that day fainted. Still to this day I am breaking out almost every day and I think it is tied to heat. Met with doctor today and she put me on steroid to try to calm down the break outs and then re-evaluate.

By around 8:45 had a temp of 99.2 aching, chills, and very hot feverish, and then began experiencing fast heart rate and feeling like I was going to pass out or vomit, wave of nausea and broke out in a cold sweat, chest tightness.  I had taken two 500 mg acetaminophen tablets from 8:45 to 9:30 p.m.  My heart rate would not slow down so 911 was called and I was taken the ER.  I was given IV fluids and Toradol.  Blood work was done and EKG showing sinus tachycardia.  After receiving the IV fluids and Toradol, felt better and was released.

After some time I felt like the lower part of my face went numb and it took tremendous effort to move my lips to talk.  At that point, the medical called the ambulance and sent me to ER, where I was under supervision for some time. I was very weak and nauseated. After I was released, I was very weak could not keep the vertical position.  The next day I was very nauseated, with awful tinnitus, lightheadedness, and weakness. Staying vertical for more than 15 minutes brought fainting symptoms.  I was not able to get out of the house to work.  The next day the fainting symptoms disappeared, everything else continued. Too weak to go to work.  I started moving about only on the 4th day after the shot.  During this event, I did not have any fever or muscle ache, no virus0tyle symptoms.

I told the clinic staff, and my blood pressure was taken. My normal blood pressure is 110/60, but at that time it was 132/81. I lay down in the exam room for about 10 minutes, and my pressure went down to 122/80. About 9 hours after the shot, I had joint pain. Twelve hours after the shot, I had shivering chills and fever which lasted through the night. My highest fever was 101.4 the morning after the shot. 48 hours after the shot, the symptoms were gone.

                                                severe chills came on about 9 hours after dose received. Could not sleep, could not get warm, intense shivering. Minor headache and dull aches throughout the body. Had to climb under an electric blanket, comforter and then another blanket on top to get warm and comfortable. As i drifted in and out of sleep through to the morning, I noticed the chills and shivering dissapating and was able to get some sleep. Awake now, still feeling a headache and flu-like aches to the body. Moving very slow. Arm  not really sore at injection site as it was upon receipt of vaccination.

I reported it to two pharmacists at the table where I received the shot and they said they haven?t ever heard of that being a side effect, so just sit for a while and rub it out and stretch it. I felt lightheaded and the sharp pain (take my breath away) pain kept happening every few minutes. I stayed for observation for an hour, and started to feel a little better so I walked to my car. I drove to my pharmacist close to my house to ask her what she would recommend, and she said to try Tylenol . The stabbing pain kept happening on and off all day yesterday, causing weakness in my leg. Today I woke up and it has been achy, tingling, burning And somewhat numb.

So I have an uncontrollable migraine almost to the point of going to the ER. What?s stopping me going is that I do t know what else they can do that I?m not already doing.   2. Low grade fever and chills: not a big deal  3. Severe fatigue to the point that it feels like my brain is ?shutting down?; I feel like I?m passing out. Eventually fave up midday, went back to bed and been sleeping for 8 hours so far   4. Dizziness  5. Extreme nausea - keep thinking I?m going to throw up

These lasted a couple of days.  However, since the day after the vaccine, I have developed severe acid reflux and heartburn.  This occurs every time I eat anything.  I have NEVER in my life had heartburn or acid reflux; only after taking the vaccine.  I also have a heaviness in my chest and cough frequently.

                                                next day extreme fatigue, fever lethargy.  Got better but never got energy back and had some body aches and trouble sleeping.  On Wed. March 25th an EXTREME headache began and I could find no relief with High doses of Tylenol or Ibuprophin or a mixture of both. It was my whole head. Stayed on the couch all day Saturday and Sunday  27th and 28th unable to move because of the pain and extreme fatigue.  Monday the 29th made myself go to work but was not able to function or get much relief.  On Tuesday the 30th went to see physician who said he thought it was Occipital Neuralgia and gave me prednisone and said use hot compresses. Told him I thought it was more due to other symptoms like hallucinations (shadows I would see) Mind not clear and made me worry about driving. Asked if the shot could be a possibility. He just said he couldn&#39;t rule it out.  The doctor also mentioned I felt very hot but never took my temperature. I Took the prednisone. Headache did start to clear on Wed the 31st in the evening but my neck seized up where I could no longer turn it to the left and was very painful. Also felt like my lymphnodes were swollen.  I called on call doctor and they prescribed a muscle relaxer.  I did not start to get better until Sunday April 11th. Experience a couple occular migranes as well during this,  Still experiencing some fatigue and almost to a fainting point in the mornings

                                                10 days after receiving  Janssen COVID-19  vaccine I suddenly developed severe pain to my right leg. Pain was so severe I could not walk, I dragged myself into the medicine pantry and believing it could possibly be a thrombosis, I instantly took 2 baby aspirins. Although I wanted to call for help, I was too far from my phone therefore I began to massage the area and remained in place until the pain subsided enough to regain movement.

After 4 days of that I got a really super heavy period with cramping and blood clots in my menustral flow.  It was a horrible period, while the one after the surgery in Feb was very light.  Dizzy and fatique  10 days after shot on the April 8 I took a fall from a chair outside, and from Thrusday to the Saturday  10th I ended up in the Emergency room with a concussion and head symptoms including dizziness and nose bleeds.  This was from a simple fall, and i suspect the covid shot might have caused complications after the fall with additional swelling and brusing.

                                                I had an unique reaction to the Johnson&amp;Johnson vaccine. 7 hours after getting the shot, my whole body went into painful spasms. My arms, legs, and torso were all twisting out of control. I was afraid I was going to fall out of my power chair, so I tilted it to prevent that from happening. Transfers were extremely difficult. My husband had to help me on and off of the toilet. This went on for about 3-4 hours. After 2 hours, I took some Tylenol to take the edge off of the spasms.

                                                4/5/2021--Received Janssen vaccine.  Felt very hot during the day.   4/6/2021--Woke up with very bad headache and rash on the injected arm plus on my stomach.  Went for a walk and felt pain in my left calf and achilles tendon.  Went to work.  4/7/2021--Started my work day as a Personal Trainer/Fitness Instructor at 6am as usual.  Taught cycling classes and trained a few clients.  Went for walk.  Still had a headache.  When I got in my car to head home, my vision was super blurry and I felt very dizzy.  I ate an orange and peanuts and hydrated more.  I was not even sure I could drive home.  I got home told my family how I was feeling.  My husband noticed my eyes were very red and swollen.  I took a shower, drank a smoothie and ate a salad.  Used my aunt&#39;s BP cuff to check my BP and it was 148/99.  I have NEVER had HBP.    4/8/21--Woke up feeling disoriented as if the left side of my face, body were off--neurological stuff.  I went to reach for grapes in the refrigerator and could not grab them.  I felt like I have never felt before and ask my husband to drive me to the ER.  While at the waiting room at the ER, I felt chest tightness and pain and nauseous.  My BP was 153/111.  Again, I have never been diagnosed or been treated for hypertension.  They did EKG, lab tests, chest X-ray.  Once my BP came down, they sent me home.   This is before all the JJ Janssen vaccine &#34;news&#34; came out and the reasons it was paused.  I developed a very bad cough about two hours after I got home from the ER.  4/9/11--Made appointment with a brand new primary care doctor.  Saw her on Monday 4/12/2021 as recommended by ER.  I had never met her before.  She prescribed a very low dose of BP medication, which I did not take because the number one side-effect is dry-cough.  I was already coughing a lot, later on with blood.  4/11/2021--Still feeling pretty bad, I woke up to the news of the Janssen vaccine being paused.  Frankly, I felt relieved that I was not going crazy.  This truly has been one of the hardest things I have ever gone (and still am) going through.  I became concerned about the pain in the left calf and heel could be a clot.   Called primary care doctor.  Had ultrasound of legs and chest x-ray the following day   4/12/2021--Had persistent cough with blood.  Went to ER at 9pm.  Had EKG, blood work, CT without contrast of chest, covid test--negative.  Got home around 2am.  4/19/21--Followed up with primary care doctor who after explaining to her I am extremely fatigued, still blurry vision, dizzy, cough better but not gone, chest discomfort on the left side, she referred me to an ophtamologist and cardiologist.  My insurance and this poorly established referral system is very difficult to navigate.  Up to now I am still waiting for the referral and pre-aurhtorization to the opthtamologist.  (4/23/2021).  I want to say, I am pretty healthy. I have worked in fitness and wellness for over 30 years. I have never drank alcohol, smoked or done any drugs.  Prior to this no physician has told me I have HBP or any issues for which I have to be medicated.  I take zero medications.  Even when I had the bad headache from the vaccine I took nothing.  I have not worked in two weeks and had not driven until last saturday.  If I don&#39;t work, I don&#39;t get paid.   I pay for almost $600/month for my insurance in the marketplace.  This has been another stressor of this storm.  Getting providers to really listen and insurance companies to take situations like this seriously.   I could not drive at night.  This has been rough and I look forward to being myself soon.  This reaction felt like a heart attack/stroke with extreme fatigue, acid reflux, cough with some blood, muscular pain.  The rash and headaches were the least of my concerns.  I am not yet recovered from all of this.  I sure hope there is no permanent damage and that this too shall pass.  It is important to note that I have tried reporting this event several times to the VAERS website online.  I completed the 4-5 pages multiple times and it would not let me submit.  I also called the VAERS 1-800 number to report and they told me to go back to the online form.  I left several messages when I could not get it done online and to this date no one has called me back.  I called to report my adverse reaction and they told me they do not take that info.  I also called the health dept.  After several phone calls to them a nurse called me back but did not take a formal report.  When someone is feeling pretty sick, this is a lot to ask of.  I persisted because I feel this is important to be reported.

                                                6 days after receiving the vaccination, my upper left arm muscles became quite painful.  Pain increased each day to the point of limiting arm range of motion, especially abduction and internal rotation.  Today is 4/25, I am still unable to internally rotate my arm, or reach behind myself due to the severity of the pain in the muscles.  Pain also prevents me from sleeping on my left side which is my natural sleep position.  I have tried OTC meds, stretching, hot/cold compresses and self massage none of which has worked to loosen up and reduce pain in my arm.   Although the level of pain is no longer increasing each day, it is not decreasing at all.

                                                Received Vaccine on the 4/8 that night I was very cold had 5 blankets, teeth shattering, severe headache, &amp; knees like if they were breaking them. The following day slight headache, weakness, not feeling good.  On the evening of 4/15, it hurt to breathe and I had a burning sensation on my rib cage going to my back. I thought I could handle it until Monday to see my Dr.  but by the time I went to the ER it hurt to walk, talk, breathe and the burning sensation would not go away.  I went to the ER on 4/17 he said I had a collapsed lung, gave me something for pain via IV.  Did an EKG, Chest X-Ray, CT Scan, and Lab work. He let me go and said to take deep breaths every hour on the hour and to drink lots of water.  I got in to see my regular Dr. on 4/22 and he said I had an allergic reaction to the vaccine.  He gave me Gabapentin 100 mg 3 times a day and Tramadol q 6 hours for pain.  I called him back because I still have the pain and now I am taking 300 mg Gabapentin in the am and 300 in the pm.  It is still not working.  I am constantly hurting the burning sensation on my rib cage and goes back to my back, it hurts to breathe, walk, talk, drive, I have blurred vision , dizziness and weakness.  I have an appointment with Dr.   again tomorrow.

                                                My appointment was on time, 4pm on 4/3 at the Pharmacy.  The young girl that gave me the shot told me she was certified, and she gave me the shot in the presence of her manager.  I have given  myself shots for years with diabetes, plus many flu shots, and have never felt pain like that.  I expressed this to her, how painful it was, and she just said &#34;I know, I know...&#34; as if it was normal for the shot to be so painful. I knew instantly something was wrong.  They were more worried, it seemed, about a potential adverse reaction such as an allergy shock, since I&#39;m allergic to a few things, but I did not experience that.  I waited 15 minutes, my arm hurting the whole time, and they suggested I go buy Tylenol for the pain, which I did.  My left arm has hurt since then. I got a horrible bruise from this shot (will send picture) that took weeks to heal.  Since then I&#39;ve continued to feel pain and don&#39;t have full mobility of my left arm. I can type, but not lifting anything heavy and have to go easy with anything on the left side.  I thought at first it might be what people were calling &#34;covid arm&#34; but I discovered that was more about soreness, not pain.  I tried ibuprofin, but after three weeks I&#39;d had enough and made a doctors appointment.  Since I was also noticing my left shoulder was very tense and tight, and I was starting to get neck stiffness in same area, I started googling before my appointment.  When I entered my symptoms, SIRVA kept popping up, so I wondered if that was what I now had because of the improper vaccine administration.  I asked my doctor for an MRI order to find out, but she said we needed to do an Xray first (which only showed mild issues related to osteo).  She offered a prescription of taking Advil 400 mg three times and day and to use a muscle relaxer when I needed it, such as at night (Cyclobenzaprine).  She said to try that for a week, and if it wasn&#39;t better, that another Dr could order MRI.  Since then I&#39;ve also added a pain spot under my left shoulder blade. Insurance called and said the order was &#34;under review&#34; so that&#39;s where things stand now. If they don&#39;t approve, I guess I will go next to an orthopedist for guidance?  This has cost me health, due to lack of sleep also - I wake up with pain in the middle of the night, even when I take the meds. Praying for a diagnosis, and solution, soon.

Strong muscle cramps across lower back began 5 hours after injection &#43; muscle cramps in neck &amp; across both shoulders 6 hours after. Lasted about 4 hours. Cramping was so bad that movement wasn&#39;t easily possible. Severe fatigue caused me to sleep for 17 hours. Day 2 (5/6/2020) fatigue came back 4 hours after being awake but no fever (31 hours after injection). Day 3 mild fatigue but otherwise normal

She was helped to a seat by a nurse and a paramedic who happened to be walking in the aisles at the same time. she responded fairly well to a mental state exam and was asked if she has a history of  illness or chronic health conditions to which she replied no. Out of an abundance of caution the paramedics were called in to further evaluate her vital signs. they offered to take her to a nearby hospital to which she reluctantly agreed.

Then my blood pressure went up and my heart started beating faster. I had tightness in my chest and I got a tickle like feeling at the top of my chest. I got nauseous. BP was elevated (140/85) normal 107/65.  I stayed for an hour. I was very very sleepy the whole time.  3/5/21 I still have the tickle and tightness and pressure on my chest and I am having vertigo attacks. I got a headache and pain and stiffness in my neck where I have had nerve pain injections and ablations.

About 30 mins later, my shoulders started to hurt. I woke up around 11:30 and I felt like a Mack truck had hit me. I had a fever, headache and chills. I remained this way for about 3 or 4 days, but improved. Then I started to become very lethargic. Just lifting my arm was a chore. On Monday, I went to see my doctor and he said that I was fine after checking everything, to include my thyroid and liver enzymes. Everything was fine, so my symptoms were attributed to the vaccine. Today, I have no pain, but I am very lethargic.

I woke up at 1:30am freezing cold and hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t get out of bed. 45 minutes later I managed to get to the bathroom and took my temp which was 103.2. I took more ibuprofen, the fever subsided to 101. I continued having a fever for 2 days along with body aches and feeling very tired. Felt fully recovered after 4 days.

                                                The patient was screened and was found to have multiple medical allergies but no allergies to any of the components to the Janssen vaccine.  As a precaution, the nurses advised a 30 minute observation.  She received the vaccine without complication and then was being observed and they called me over and the paramedics were also with the patient.  About 17 minutes into observation, the patient started developing chest pressure (4/10), lightheadedness, and nausea.  No shortness of breath, stridor, diaphoresis, back pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, neurologic changes, and any signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis.  She was very anxious.  Further history revealed that the patient had been discharged from the hospital 6 week prior.  She initially went in for an abdominal laproscopic surgery and woke up to having 32 staples closing an abdominal incision.  They had to change from a laproscopic approach to an open abdomen approach due to complications.  She ended up with sepsis and a colostomy and was hospitalized for 2 weeks getting antibiotics.  She lives by herself and was overwhelmed before coming into the clinic for her vaccine.   The paramedics did a 12-lead ECG that showed sinus rhythm.  Vital signs and blood glucose were within normal limits.  The paramedics recommended that she go to the hospital to be checked out but she was very resistant and was tearful because she was traumatized from her previous hospitalization.  After some time, the paramedics convinced her to go to the hospital.  The paramedics hung around the emergency department and then came back once they found out that she was fine.

                                                8 hours after injection started having severe lower back and leg pain. Then came the horrible headache causing nausea and dizziness which ultimately resulted in causing me to pass out while attempting to get to the couch. Once I came to the body trembles  started accompanied by being freezing cold. The headache and diarrhea lasted into the next day with symptoms not lessening until day 3. Still have to take Tylenol every 4 hours to keep headache manageable.  I did not seek medical treatment but would strongly warn those getting this shot of the possible  loss of consciousness. It came on very fast, 8 hours after the injection,  and could be deadly if someone was driving or not near soft surroundings.

                                                In the middle of the night of the 10th of April I started having what seemed like normal side effects---muscle aches, headache, fatigue.. and then all day on the 10th the same side effects.   Then last night I slept 9 straight hours but woke up  sweating a couple times in night and in morning woke up sweating but my aches and headache seemed better than the day before so I went downstairs to make tea.  After pouring a glass of orange juice and having a couple sips I started to feel strange --dizzy and oversome with a strange feeling that was not quite like the feeling before fainting -- my back had a weird pain and i was a little nauseous as well. ..it was more overwhelming -- more loss of control like a huge wave of dizziness and ringing.  I made my way to a couch to try to regain balance -- but was still very dizzy-- something happened to make me try to get up and go upstairs so I remember walking 12 feet or so then told myself to sit down.  Before that happened I must have blacked out.  I faintly remember moving myself across the floor but then must have blacked out again.  I woke up at the base of the stairwell and then was able to walk upstairs.    I had collapsed the first time onto a hard floor as my orange juice glass had spilled all over and when I got upstairs my sweatshirt was covered in juice.  I don&#39;t remember any of that.  Once upstairs I drank water and have been fine since then.  I had eaten dinner the night before but maybe it was the sweating in the night that dehydrated me and i cramped up and had a strange pain in my back---i don&#39;t know.  I am a very healthy 56 yr old woman 5&#39;3&#34; 105 lbs so maybe the Johnson and JOhnson one dose was a lot for my body or maybe my body was just doing what it&#39;s supposed to do to react to vaccine.... i also may have had asymptomatic covid in the last year so my body was overreacting.   This happened 7 hours ago and I seem fine aside from slight headache and continued weakness from vaccine but I thought I should report the incident in case there might be something more or in case others had similiar responses.

Once in ambulance they put IV in and gave Zofran through IV, I don&#39;t know if they put anything else in there.  Blood pressure stabilized around 110 which is normal for me, I normally have low blood pressure and heart rate.  Nausea and dizziness dissipated by the time I got to hospital.  They put EKG on also while I was in ambulance and said I was having PVC&#39;s advised dr to do another EKG once I got to hospital.  Felt better by about 5:00 PM.  Overnight I had slight fever and body aches, took Advil and symptoms subsided.  Slight soreness in arm and armpit, but not major.  Have been feeling fine now other than being traumatized by the whole event.

                                                Five days 18 hours after receiving the Janssen vaccine shot, I awoke with an unusual and very painful headache. Having only been asleep for about two hours, I didn&#39;t want to get up and tried to rearrange myself for relief. Getting slight relief, I did fall asleep again after moving around and drinking water over about an hour. I awoke two hours later (about 10:00 AM) with almost unbearable head pain throughout my head, not localized to one area. I drove to fast food restaurant, having a difficult time driving due to pain, and got a half-sweet tea. Tea, having caffeine and some sugar, can often relieve a headache. It didn&#39;t offer the relief I expected and about 30 minutes later, I vomited up the tea. I was at that same time ordering a sandwich and detox smoothie, thinking the detox smoothie may help. It seemed to after a couple more hours, but I continued to feel like the headache was still barely there and waiting to return. I ate very well and clean all day, but even late in the evening, I cod feel remnants of a headache. The next morning, 4/12, I awoke again with that same horrible headache, but maybe just slightly less excruciating than the day before. I did not vomit. After a few hours of eating, drinking water, and taking aspirin with Tylenol, the headache subsided.

As more days passed; I was feeling tired, could not raise my arms, legs were weak and hurting.  If I did anything (shower or carry a simple laundry basket) my arms would hurt so bad, I was out of breath and my heart was pounding so hard.  By the week of March 29th - I was laying down in the middle of the day, no energy at all.  Called the doctor and because of the shortness of breath &amp; Body aches, they would only schedule a video visit for Monday, April 5th.  After talking to me, they schedule to see me that day at 11:45 AM.  I had weak muscle response in my arms, pale, and out of breath.  They did blood work.  Two hours after getting home; they called and said I needed to get to the emergency room.  My red blood cell count was dangerously low, and they ordered a blood transfusion.  I sent 6 days in the hospital.

                                                At the time of the vaccine, I felt fine, soreness at the injection site but nothing. For days later, I began to feel, ill all over and could not get out of bed.  I had severe abdominal pain, aches and pains all over my body.  Particularly in places where I had pre existing conditions.  As the day progressed, I continued to have severe GI issues, could not eat (pain like food was stuck) heart burn, constipation (clamy like flu).  Shortness of breath, I could not walk far.  I took 3 trips to the ER where they treated for the abdominal spasms, UTI, and pain.  By the end of the week I had a slight fever.  I tested negative for COVID during that time.  For two weeks I was unable to eat, get out of bed.  I had several petite mal seizures.  If felt like my body was fighting the vaccine and the vaccine was attaching all of me weak or any preexisting conditions.  Eventually, after 3.5 weeks I was able to sit up, and walk. I still have shortness of breath, some fogginess,  Muscle strain, walking with a cane and a lump at the injection site.

Given her use of Coumadin with described severe headache, head CT was obtained.  This did not reveal any acute pathology.  Patient was treated with a combination of IV fluids, IV Reglan, IV Benadryl, oral Valium, scopolamine patch, IV Haldol, IV magnesium, IV Decadron for combined dizziness and headache.  She reported complete resolution of headache thereafter.  She was able to ambulate midway through her emergency department visit but later reported intractable dizziness for which she felt uncomfortable being discharged.  As such, general medicine was contacted for observation admission to obtain MRI to rule out posterior infarct and continue treatment for her intractable dizziness.  MRI obtained 4/18 with and without contrast showed no evidence of acute infarct and no evidence of active demyelinating lesions.  Findings compatible with known history of multiple sclerosis with supratentorial demyelination.  There was no of opacified right maxillary sinus for which she will continue Flonase.  Patient was seen by physical therapy who felt she was safe for discharge as she was able to ambulate independently without persistent dizziness.  PT and Care Management arranged for in-home physical therapy 3-5 times per week.  Prescriptions for Antivert and Zofran provided for presumed peripheral vertigo.  Did discuss the possibility of current symptoms being related to Janssen COVID 19 vaccination on March 25th, although I did convey this seemed unlikely to patient and her brother.  Patient is to follow up with her primary care doctor and was provided strict return precautions.  in 4/20/21 phone call f/u with RN Care Manager pt reports ongoing dizziness, headaches including new onset diarrhea.

On 4/17 a burning redness and swelling of her legs bilaterally which worsened and she became unable to walk secondary to pain and swelling. Also reported shortness of breath. The rash was initially wheals spreading up legs with pain, burning and allodyina to light touch. It then spread to arms bilaterally.

It lasted 36 hours and then I felt my Vestibular Migraines. I was dizzier than usual. Under my left armpit was very painful reaching toward my left breast. The area of the shot was not painful. I also had dizziness chest pains under my right clavicle immediately after I got the shot. The chest pain went away for three days and then it came back.  It was like an extreme muscle ache. It was a dull and intermittent pain. I was referred to a Respiratory clinic and I still had a low grade fever.  My left arm was stiff two weeks before the shot and  three days after the shot my  left shoulder was frozen. I had an appointment with my Orthopedist and she confirmed an encapsulated shoulder problem.  At present after three weeks my shoulder is still frozen and my armpit is still a little painful. The chest pains are less frequent.

SHE WAS EXTREMELY DIZZY AND HOT SO WE GOT HER AN ICE PACK TO COOL DOWN AND SHE REMAINED LAYING ON THE FLOOR FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES UNTIL SHE WAS NO LONGER DIZZY. SHE SAID SHE GETS THIS VASOVAGAL REACTION ANYTIME SHE GETS A SHOT OR BLOOD DRAWS. AFTER 5 MINUTES, SHE WAS ABLE TO BE SEATED IN THE CHAIR WHERE I WATCHED HER FOR 15 MINUTES MORE. SHE WAS OKAY WHEN SHE LEFT.

For the following 24 hours I developed intense body aches, fatigue, headache, and slight dizziness. Overall the side effects lasted around 48 hours after injection. After that initial period there have been only minor instestinal discomfort and tiredness.

After the first 24 hours, my breathing became more shallow, and I had an increased hunger to add to the body aches.  I felt as if I had the flu.   At 36 hours after injection, I started having a head ache that caused me to be dizzy upon standing. I am making this report 46 hours after and I still have a slight headache and some nausea/excess saliva.

Crushing pain all over body, joints and muscles. Stabbing headache similar to a migraine. Dizziness. Diarrhea for 1 day; abdominal pain for nearly two weeks. Intermittent nausea for nearly two weeks. Felt like I had a fever, although the thermometer said 99.7. The feverish feeling lasted for 3 days. The crushing pain lasted for nearly two weeks. The dizziness was intermittent for two weeks. Got a full-blown migraine headache 4 days after vaccine. Please note: I did NOT take my nightly aspirin dose for 2 days prior to vaccine so as to not affect the immune response. I restarted my nightly dose at 11 PM,  6 hours following the vaccine. Still had all the above-mentioned symptoms.

                                                Difficulty taking deep breaths, dizziness that felt more like vertigo (the floor and ceiling spinning whenever I stood or sat up), exhausted to the point that I could not sit up without falling asleep.  I slept 14hrs straight for two days after the shot.  Tired after walking down the driveway and back.  Entire body aching with excruciating pain but not the left arm where the shot was taken.  Headaches were bad as well.  No appetite.  The 3rd day afterwards I felt better but still very tired.  The 4th day still tired but better.  Tylenol, caffeinated coffee and lots of water seem to help me get through this.  The fifth day afterward, I am almost 100%  but dealing with running nose and eyes which may not be related to the shot.

                                                They did not have me stay at there store and wait a few mintues. I got in my car to drive home. I live 2.9 miles from the store. After about 5-6 minutes in the car, I started to feel bad, and I felt I should pull over.  I was on the road and traffic was super busy. I did pass out in front of a store on the road while driving my car. I came too and saw a restaurant. I pulled into their parking lot and texted my husband to come and get me. When he got there, I could barely stand. I layed down in the back of his truck because I could not sit up. My arm went number but I could wiggle my fingers.  We did drive to the hospital because I was so weak. but after the 15 minute drive to get to the hospital, I was able to sit up and walk again. I did not want to pay the $500 deductible so I my husband drove me home where I am sitting on the couch resting now.  My husband is a Chiropractor, so he has a lot of medical background.

Patients breathing was fine, but she was extremely lethargic/limp. Was coherent but slow to answer questions, excessively sweating and pale, small amount of vomit. At one point, patient said that she did not know where she was. Said that her fingers felt numb and tingly (could not pick up water or orange juice...we had to put water and juice to her lips to drink). She said that she needed to lay down. Per patient she had oatmeal with very little sugar for breakfast and coffee. Believe the reaction was a vasovagal response.

                                                Started having a headache on Tuesday afternoon, took migraine pill (excedrin) with minimal improvement.  Went out to dinner later that night and couldn&#39;t finish dinner d/t HA.  Describes head pressure, pain, and pounding sensation.  On Wednesday worked from home, felt like she was in a fog and continued to have pain/pressure in the back of her head.  Pt took a nasal decongestant which pt is unsure if made any better.  Thursday continued to have headache but improved compared to Tuesday and Wednesday.    Had taken benadryl at school which was somewhat helpful.  Saw PCP today via telemedicine visit. PCP prescribed steroid; had not started taking this because started feeling worse and came into the ED for this.     Earlier today, had worsened HA and felt like she was going to pass out (did not pass out).  She felt like her left hand was numb/pins/needles as her son was taking her BP; lasted for a few minutes.  Later, her right hand started feeling numb/pins/needles and had difficulty picking up objects.   57-year-old female  presented with a headache and found to have a subdural hematoma of unknown etiology.   Neurosurgery was consulted.   Patient was initiated on Keppra 500 mg b.i.d. for seizure prophylaxis. Serial CT scans were done  Which showed stable subdural hemorrhage.  Blood pressure was monitored during her stay but did not require any as needed medication.  Further imaging including MRI and MRV were performed to assess for aneurysm or venous malformation however nothing was seen.  Bleeding disorder workup was not performed. Neurology was consulted.  EEG was ordered to assess for seizure activity however this was negative.

Reported the continued arm pain the next day to the doctor and she ordered an ultrasound. Report negative on blood arm clot. Got a fever, body aches, headache, tired, triggered a migraine per doctor, localized reaction of 2 3/4&#34; at injection site with redness, swelling, pain. Almost passed out at a store - Became dizzy, tingling hands and sweating and taken to ER by ambulance. ER ruled out blood clot but found I had a UTI without any symptoms-prescribed an antibiotic. Contiue to have minor headache and minor discomfort at injection site. Awful experience and adverse reactions!

                                                Uncontrollable shaking, teeth chattering, fever of 102, barely able to walk due to the shaking, nausea, body aches, and joint pain, occuring approximately 7 hours after vaccination and lasting approximately 14 hours . Severe facial/sinus pain on left side of face March 20 (approximately 48 hrs after vaccine) lasting about 24 hours. And then Mild facial/sinus pain on left side of face lasting another 24 hours. Used ibuprofin, meloxocam 7.5 mg, and extra strength tylenol to help relieve side effects. The first 7 hours after the vaccine none of the anti-inflammatory medications helped to relieve any side effects. The facial pain I experienced a day later was relieved somewhat with the anti-inflammatories.

                                                I had a rash from the shot and an immediate headache in my temple right above my eye. I started to get Migraines which became very painful four days after the vaccine. I had to go to the ER because the pain was so bad one day that I almost passed out. It is a much different pain than my normal Migraines my left arm and leg were numb. I have been getting Migraines daily for five weeks now. I have been trying to control my diet and switched medication in an effort to control the Migraines. The medication helps a little if I take it early. I also still get a little of the numbness in the left side of my body. All services provided by insurance company.

                                                I tracked my symptoms in a notebook because they were so severe on Day 1. Day 1-3: sore arm, headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, foggy brain, unable to focus, chills/uncontrollable shaking for several hours, body aches. Day 4: Same symptoms as above but milder. Bleeding gums when brushing teeth on left side of mouth (this NEVER happens). Painful gums (does happen when very sick with a virus). Day 5-6: Feeling better, but tired. Day 7: Tired, headache, nausea following exercise. Day 8-12: Mild feeling of discomfort while peeing. Tired every day.  A bitt foggy every day but this happens with pollen season. Day 18: tired, trouble breathing on treadmill- I attributed this to pollen as it went away the next day when I closed the window. Day 20 (May 1): While out with friends, after having lunch and a glass of wine, I jumbled a few words and could not say them correctly. There were just about two words in two sentences. I tried a few times and they kept coming out wrong. It was nothing I have ever experienced before. We laughed it off but I felt very unsettled and a bit concerned about driving home. I drove home and was fine. I remain tired and feeling foggy which could be  due to pollen. I have scheduled an appointment with a clinician today and hope to have some blood work done.

I was taken to the ER and kept there approx. 5 hours.  I was extremely weak, could not lift my head and had trouble forming thoughts and words.  They gave me medication via IV&#39;s and observed me.  I started to feel better after about 4 hours after the vaccine, but have had more headaches than usual after receiving it.  I still have some issues with being upset and anxious about the reaction and if it will have long term adverse effects on me.  I will never get another vaccine of any type again.

                                                3/11/21, 5:00 pm started to feel very cold, fingers started to feel numb, by 6:00 pm had severe chills and shivering, fingers were white and fingernails were blue. I became extremely dizzy, so much so that just moving my head or moving from under my blankets or even talking would create a sensation like zaps or electrical jolts inside my head. By this time, I had about four thick blankets on me. This calmed the chills. If I moved even just my hand outside of the blankets, I would immediately start shivering again. I felt my worst at about 9:00 pm. Slowly got better. Drank a lot of water. Dizziness and chills subsided by about 12 midnight and left me with a headache. Tylenol helped reduce that. Slept the rest of the night. Today from about 9:00 am until currently 5:40 pm, I have had slight muscle aches, fatigue, slept on and off all day. Still a bit dizzy but not too bad.

It lasted a minute or so. At 2am on Fri. 3/26 woke up to nausea, SEVERE body aches, Severe headache, weakness. I could barely lift my legs or get up from the commode ,chills, and fever of 100.00. I had started taking Tylenol 500 to 1000 mg  around 6pm on 3/25 and continued every 4 hours. The pain from the body aches was so bad that Tylenol wasn&#39;t helping. My fever stayed in the 100&#39;s with 1000mg of Tylenol. I started seeing symptoms ease up on Saturday 3/27. I no longer had chills and fever but just mild body aches and fatigue.  Had diarrhea on 3/27.

                                                I felt fine immediately after the injection - just a little pain in the arm where I got the injection and when raising my arm. By 6:30 pm I was achy all over and my legs were aching a lot. When I went to bed around 8:00, I hurt all over (achy and flu-like feeling, but no fever). I dozed off and on and about midnight when I woke up, I had a very rapid heartbeat. This went on all night and into the morning. It was hard to get any sleep at all. When I&#39;d get up to go to the bathroom, I was slightly dizzy and unsteady on my feet. After I got up at 6:30 am, the highest my heartrate got was 113, then it finally began going down. I was still hurting all over, felt extremely tired, and now had fever - 99.8. The fever lasted off and on all day and into the next night. I was also very nauseated all day and I felt extremely bloated. I also had a bad headache. When I woke up on Friday, my fever and the headache was gone, but I felt extremely tired and weak and still nauseated. I slept most of the day and I still ached all over, but not as much. My lymph nodes were also swollen. On Friday afternoon, I walked up to the mailbox and I was winded and unsteady. On Saturday, I felt a little better, but was still extremely tired. By Saturday night, all the aches, pains and headache were back and I didn&#39;t sleep well at all. I rested most of Sunday and felt a little better Sunday evening. The aches and pains were going away, but I was still very tired and exhausted. I felt the same way when I woke up on Monday morning. It seemed like the vaccination made the aches and pains I normally had with Fibromyalgia about three times as bad as usual. And I was still very bloated feeling all over. By Monday afternoon the nausea finally went away. By Monday afternoon I was feeling a little better, but still tired. On Tuesday I felt better still and I noticed that I wasn&#39;t bloated as much. It seemed like I was getting back to normal.

I walked over to patient and she was sitting in observation area with her head in between her legs. She stated she felt dizzy with no other symptoms, no difficulty breathing or throat closure. Pt was then moved to the cot so that she can lay and elevate her legs. Pt stated that she has a tremendous fear of needles. This happens more often than not when she gets vaccines or blood drawn. I took pt&#39;s first set of vitals that read BP: 130/60 HR: 73 O2: 100% RR: 20. I then stayed with pt for 10 minutes before repeating vitals. Repeat Vitals at 2:30pm were BP: 132/60 HR: 75 O

                                                Prior to receiving her COVID-19 vaccine, the patient was already having symptoms from anxiety/nervousness about the vaccine. Patient was given her injection and within 1-2 minutes, she began feeling dizzy and lightheaded. The vaccine administrator came to me (pharmacist on duty) to notify me that she was not feeling well. I went to go check on her and she stated that she felt as though she was going to faint. I advised her to stay seated, asked if she would like an ice pack and water, and stepped out to get those for her while remaining vigilant (because I wanted to be in the same room as her for observation/safety). I brought her the ice pack, she held it on her chest and head and said it felt nice. After about a minute I stepped out again to ask a technician to get a water for her. When I came back, the patient was still seated but had a blank stare and her mouth was slightly open. I repeated her name out loud and nudged her shoulder several times, however the patient was unresponsive completely. I immediately looked for the red emergency kit in the consultation room but did not see one (I later found out that there was an EpiPen on the table in the room, but I did not see it at the time due to the urgency of the situation). I rushed back into the pharmacy, told the technicians to call 911, and took an EpiPen off the shelf in the pharmacy. I ran back into the room and the patient&#39;s face was very red, her eyes were bulging slightly, and it looked like she was trying to reach her hand up or move it, but was unable to. I injected her with the EpiPen immediately, and within roughly 5 seconds she came back to consciousness and looked at me and said &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34;. EMS arrived extremely fast and was there a few minutes after using the EpiPen. She was then taken by ambulance to the hospital. Patient had a friend, with her at the store who was scheduled to receive the vaccine as well, but after the incident she decided otherwise. Later that evening I gave patient&#39;s friend a phone call to check and see how patient was doing, and to also let her know that patient&#39;s vaccination card was at the pharmacy if she wanted to pick it up. That evening around 6:30-7pm, patient&#39;s husband came to the pharmacy to get her card, he updated us that she was being discharged from the hospital and that she was okay.

Finally fell asleep around 5:30am still with a really bad headache.  Woke up at 11:00am.  Brushed my teeth and started to feel nausea.  I went back to my bedroom and I got lightheaded to where my vision was blurred.  Layed on the bed and felt really bad with a sweaty face and still nauseas.  Had someone bring me grapes and some tea and layed there.  I felt bad for about 45 min. then I fell asleep.  Got up about 3:30 hours later feeling better, but not 100%  Still a bit of a headache but nausea went away.  Today I feel back to my normal self.  I thought you&#39;d like to know I did experience some of the side effects for your records.

About 15 hours after the vaccine, I still had the headache, nausea,  dizzy,  and additional slight diarrhea, dry heaves, rapid heartbeat, and feeling very tired  and weak but went from chills to hot and sweating.   This lasted for about an hour and then it was back to body chills, headache, nausea, body fatigue for the next 24 hours.   My arm and injection site did not hurt, only if I would rub across that area of my arm.   I have still experienced the fatigue 60 hours after the vaccine.  Nausea has still come on different time during this time too.

                                                4-9-21 The morning of I tested negative for COVID, took vaccine that afternoon. Following morning, 4-9-21 woke up with 101 fever. Took Tylenol at 4 am.  Did not take anything else since.  Fever subsided in low  99&#39;s throughout that day. No other symptoms.  4-10-21 Woke up fine, no fever. Went to work at 7 am.  Toward end of work day, vaccination site became sore and I felt out of sorts.  4-11-21 Woke up fine, no fever. Went to work at 7 am. By noon, feeling foggy. Very sore throughout my body, especially upper body and vaccination site. 4-12-21 Woke up ok, no fever but not quite myself. Went to work 7 am. At about 8 am began to feel a bit foggy , dizzy and almost past out. Blood pressure taken by medics was normal but high for me, after resting  for 15 minutes it had gone done to my normal.  Went back to work station sitting  down but the foggy &amp; dizziness continued off and on. Went back to my hotel to rest at 1 pm. While resting felt better but when moving out of bed sensations would come back. Some pain in left side vaccination and shoulder/neck pain but that may be related to chronic issues. 4-13-21 Stayed home to rest, fogginess continues, pain in vaccination site down arm.

                                                Most troubling adverse event has been Vertigo and Dizziness.  Within 13 hours of vaccination, I experienced chills, joint pain, weakness, muscle aches, fever.  36-40 hours fever decreased as did most body aches,  but I then started experiencing intermittent Vertigo.  It has  decreased in frequency, but still as late as 16 days later it has occurred.  In between I have daily had light headedness/dizziness  (still having dizziness) and sometimes a low grade fever, i.e. around 99.5 as well as headache.  Not sure if all this is related to vaccine, but I have never had Vertigo before.

To this day I am still dealing with the headache, the pain not just in the arm but allover, gastro intestinal problems. It has impacted my sleep tremendously because the level of pain is very high. The one thing that went away that very first night was the low fever.  But this vaccine is like a Wish (cheap store) Vaccine. They SHOULD NOT give this to immunocompromised people and the &#34;few days&#34; rhetoric does not apply to us and that should be specified! Initially I thought this was to be expected when I heard a Doctor on the news say: &#34;if you fell like you got ran over by a truck, that is normal.&#34; So,  that is how I felt, so I thought it was normal.

I got up and walked back over to my waiting chair and my Husband got up and received his vaccine.    Besides the pain in my left arm,  I started feeling weird tingling sensations and spaced out.  When my Husband sat back down next to me,  my stomach had a burning sensation and I felt slightly nauseated.  Then I felt like I was about to faint.  My Husband and the Staff kept me from falling, The Staff brought ice packs to put on my neck.  They said I turned white and profusely sweat.   I don&#39;t remember all of it, my Husband filled in the blanks.  I started feeling better and we left @4:30.

I got the vaccine at 9am.  around 4pm that afternoon i started feeling sick.  by 7:30pm I was in bed thinking I was going die!   By midnight, I got up and tried to walk to the stairs but i was to weak to walk.  I could not sleep.  I was up for 36 hours!  I was nauseous, dizzy, weak, exhausted.  Every inch of my body had pain!!!  I was tingling all over.  I  had the chills until midnight.  My heart would race and then stop... then race again... I was having difficulty breathing!  I tried standing up but I couldn&#39;t.  I would have driven myself to the emergency room but I couldn&#39;t walk.  by noon the next day, my heart regulated, I was able to breath easier.  I was still exhausted and full of pain and tingling.  Today, I still have some pain, but no tingling.

And then about midweek, I was starting to walk downstairs at work and I had to grab onto rails so I wouldn&#39;t fall - had become so dizzy. I tried to get into my regular doctor -  he was full until April 5. I went into walk-in clinic - I  had to grab onto a board there (dizzy) and they told me to get to ER. My heart was rapid heart beat by time I got to ER. They had to give me wheelchair so I wouldn&#39;t fall over to go into the ER room. Horrible bruising on wrist - because the first IV didn&#39;t take. They gave me a bag of fluids - and gave me Meclizine to help dizziness subside and two Tylenols for headache. I&#39;m taking 3  (per day)- 25 mg chewable HCI Meclizine. If symptoms aren&#39;t as bad I just take a half of one. Still needing the medication because I still have the pressure in the ear comes up and I need to take the Meclizine and Benadryl to get the pressure to go down.

When I tried to stand up I fell back on the bed.  Had to sit still for 10 minutes until the spinning stopped.  Moved carefully for a few hours.  Ran a half marathon.  After the half, if I turned my head quickly, I felt the vertigo return but it was not as bad as when I woke up.

                                                About 6 hours after receiving the vaccine I started getting a headache and felt chills. I was on my way to a hotel before leaving for a flight the next morning and was driving. When I stopped driving and attempted to exit my car, I experienced dizziness and stroke like symptoms. My legs would not hold me up and I felt as if I would pass out in the road. I held on to the car for several minutes until the feeling abated somewhat. Then I made my way unsteadily into the  hotel building and had to sit down for several minutes. My heart was beating rapidly and I felt strange so I took one of my nitroglycerin and also took an extra 12.5 mg Coreg.  After being taken to my room, I laid on the bed and continued to feel  weak, lightheaded and became very nauseous. I got out my pulse oximeter and my pulse was 95.  I took another Coreg and it seemed to slow it down for a little while but again it started racing and I continued to be nauseous and broke out in sweats and my pulse got back up to 100. I took another nitroglycerin and a baby aspirin in case I was having a heart attack. Then I took another Coreg. My pulse rate finally slowed down. I slept intermittently until going to the airport at 5 a.m.  I still felt weak and nauseous and very tired.

                                                FYI, Approx. 1:00 AM woke up with high fever and could hardly move. Whole body hurt very bad. Shaking from chills . Bad headache. Very thirsty. Definitely flu like symptoms, but worse. Turned electric blanket on, very cold, and just tried to sleep. Only getting out of bed to use restroom and more water. Straight back to bed. I did not vomit, nor did I have diarrhea.  Could not stand it any longer Saturday PM approx. 10:00 took two Advil. Woke up Sunday 8:00 AM felt much better. Still had slight symptoms, but I could do chores. My brother kept checking on me. Came to let my dog out. My brother wanted me to call 911 but I can not afford that.  It was holiday weekend,  I wanted to die, didn?t care.  I get the flu shot every year. I have a high pain tolerance, very rare for me to be sick.  If I needed a second dose. I would NOT get it. If I would have known it was that bad, I would not have signed up to get it. Thank you.

About 6 hours later, body pain, chills, body temperature dis-regulation (hot/cold/sweaty) throughout the night. At approximately 10:30 a.m. (approx. 20 hours post injection) I was standing at the kitchen counter getting some water, still experiencing extreme fatigue and body pain, about 4 hours after a dose of Extra Strength Tylenol, and had some kind of weird event where I began to feel faint and before I knew it, my body began convulsing (large shakes) and the next thing I knew I was seated on the kitchen floor and my husband was asking me &#34;what happened&#34;. It never happened again and we decided an ambulance was not necessary. But I thought to report it because this kind of thing is not on the &#34;the list&#34; of expected side effects.

                                                Fever, chills, severe headache and fatigue. It was exhausting opening my eyes.   Even after two weeks I would try to convince myself to pull over  in my truck and take a nap!  I am still extremely tired.  My  Heart was pounding, throbbing in ?my ears?.  I could hear it so loudly . 2weeks of brain fog ? could not stay on task (due to dehydration?)  I still can?t drink enough water and Gatorade to satisfy my thirst. Extreme Weakness, Nausea , especially when I would try to eat .  Increased thirst/ urination .  My ankles and feet swelled .  My friend who is a pharmacist instructed me to take a Tylenol but I couldn?t even get out of bed to get one to take.  ? any movement made my head swim and I felt like I would throw up.  I slept most of that day and also the next day

                                                Immediately after administration patient felt extremely dizzy and about to faint. We placed her on the floor with her feet elevated. Placed an icepack behind her neck. Patient never lost consciousness. But, since patient was reporting a &#34;body buzz&#34; we called 911 to be on the safe side since patient has severe allergies. Paramedics came, checked the patient and decided she did not need further treatment.

                                                My shoulder area became very sore 8 days after the injection (no symptoms prior).  It felt like I&#39;d torn a muscle and couldn&#39;t lift my arm above my head or use it to carry or lift items.  It got sorer through the weekend so Sunday morning I applied Chinese cups to the area (I&#39;m a licensed massage therapist) and the whole shoulder area (4 cups) turned dark purple - I&#39;ve never experienced so big of an area turn purple.  It relieved a little but Monday I went to see a neurological chiropractor which relieved some.  On Sunday and Tuesday I took 800 mg/ibuprofen which seemed to help relieve some of the pain.

Tinnitus feels like it&#39;s getting worse. I did have a fever ranging from 100- 101 for about 18 hours after vaccine, with headache, lightheadedness (the latter which also occurred immediately after  vaccine)

I also started to develop a fast heartrate which felt like palpitations. The same evening, I had severe migraines which lasted for the next three days. It is 4/15/21, and I feel exhausted and have flu-like symptoms.

                                                Experienced an unusual headache on about April 8th.  It felt like it was behind my left eye, and in front of my left ear. Pain subsided in about an hour after resting. On April 28th, I experienced vaginal bleeding.  I awoke to a dry cough and felt the leakage.  The blood was bright red and I&#39;d estimate 4-6 Tablespoons.  I feel light-headed, concerned, but otherwise fine.

                                                Immediately that evening, I started to get headachy and nauseous. My arm in the injection site was very sore. The next morning, the other arm was sore. It was difficult for me to raise my arms above my head without feeling extremely weak. I couldn&#39;t lift anything above my head for the fear I would drop them. Knee replacement surgery on both knees about 4 years ago - I felt pain in my knees; all my joints; all of my teeth; my vision was blurry. My head hurt so badly. Tylenol dulled the headache and joint pain but it didn&#39;t help it to go away. My chest also hurt quite a bit. I felt extremely lethargic.  I didn&#39;t feel like getting out of bed. I could only get the  meals  made (I&#39;m a caregiver for my mom and mother-in-law) and then get back into bed. I usually walk five miles a day. I&#39;m still not there yet ( to walk that much) but I&#39;m getting better. The nausea lasted until the 17th. The headache just left finally on April 23. The body aches, teeth ache and joints subsided around the 17th also. The blurry vision - I still have a a little bit of that but it&#39;s starting to improve. The weakness in the arm - that is starting to improve - I do still feel kind of weak when I raise my arms above my head. The fatigue I still have but I&#39;m feeling a bit of improvement.  I have to keep checking my bed to see if I accidentally put the massage setting on (and I hadn&#39;t) because my body was shaking  in entire  body- That started on the second day after the vaccine and stopped about the 19th. I called to the advice nurse to register my health complaint and she had me come in for a full workup. And she asked me to go to ER. They kept me in the ER overnight.
