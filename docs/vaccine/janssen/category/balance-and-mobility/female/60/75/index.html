                                                Sensitivity started within four hours of dose. Autistic sensitivities to maximum. Scrambling of all senses including proprioception to the point of not being able to move from standing  or sitting. By hour seven, all sensory inputs were too overwhelming to do anything but shut down and sleep. 911 was not an option because they don&#39;t let you sleep, and ERs are overwhelming already, before maximizing all inputs. 7.5 mg hydrocodone for overwhelming pain and sensitivity, allowed sleep. On waking, sensitivity was lessened, but the pain started, 18 hours after the vaccination. Emotional lability for three days. Average aching of arm and injection site were not above expected levels. &#34;Brain fog&#34; and lack of ability to articulate (another autism symptom) started within that first seven hours, and diminished over next ten days. Not yet gone as of today  Dry mouth; overproduction of thick &#39;chunky&#39; mucus that wouldn&#39;t cough out, treated with guaifenesin, lasted three days. Shortness of breath and cough associated with that mucus also diminished after three days. Not completely gone ten days later.   Excessive thirst, onset two hours after vaccine, lasted two days.   Hyperalert (can&#39;t sleep without drugs), hyperactive despite weakness, and hypervigilant (extreme startle reflexes) lasted three days as well. Sleep was achieved with hydrocodone and THC.  All over body pain, feelings of immune mobilization (coming down with) for two days were not above expected levels.   No fainting or other collapse at time of injection, or later.  Knowing that severe over-stimulation is exacerbated in a medical setting, it was decided not to seek medical support for three days of systemic symptoms that would have easily merited hospitalization.

                                                Shot immediately started stinging.  My upper arm swelled with a hard ridge about 3 inches long and 1 inch wide.  Extremely painful.  Could barely raise my arm and could not sleep on that side or tolerate even soft touch of my entire upper arm.  No other reaction that seemed like an allergic response.  I did get very sick for 2 days with severe flu symptoms and strange shooting pains in random parts of my body.  Enough pain to wake me from a sound sleep.  Bad chills, but no fever. I did. I give my legs seemed swollen for about 3 days.   I got the J&amp;J vaccine on 3-6-21 and my arm is still swollen with a slightly smaller hard and painful ridge at the injection site and it sometimes throbs and itches severely.  Today is 4-2-21.  Starting to wonder if it will ever go away.  I still cannot sleep on that side.  The pain overall is less, but it still throbs and itches periodically throughout the day.

I checked her blood pressure, which registered as 80/60.  I offered to call 911, due to hypotension, but when I checked it on her other arm, it was 177/87, which she confirmed was closer to her baseline.  Additionally, she complained of nausea and vomited.  I then offered to call 911 again, but she said that she was feeling better.  I continued to monitor her, and offered to call an ambulance again,  She did not complain of any difficulty breathing or chest tightness/pain. I continued to monitor her for twenty minutes, and then she said that she wanted to go home.  I offered to call an ambulance again, but she assured me that she felt better and wanted to go home.

Headache started in the front of my forehead by late evening, and I literally couldn&#39;t even walk up to my bed.  Restless sleeping with all the sweating and chills.  Woke up with headache remaining and feeling very &#34;wiped out&#34; and still light-headed.  No more chills or sweats the next day, but I was weak for about 48 hours.  Honestly - I&#39;m very healthy and getting Covid directly from another person couldn&#39;t have been worse than getting  the vaccine.  :(   And I am even saying that as a 35 year professional Research Scientist.

                                                I got an itchy rash on my right leg within the first 15 minutes, staff at the site tried to get me to belief it was from anxiety. The redness subsided though bumps remained when they let me go home. I also felt a bit &#34;detached&#34; on the drive home and really had to concentrate on my driving. Once home, I still felt odd but went about my day. About four hours later, I realized I was scratching my stomach and chest while watching TV. Upon raising my shirt, I saw a bright red rash on the top part of my belly that extended underneath both breasts and to the area directly over my heart, and up my left side into my left armpit. All of these areas were very itchy. I put Hydrocortisone cream on them, which helped reduce the itching quite quickly. I then took half a Benadryl tablet. When I awoke the next morning, the areas that had been bright red now had dark red dots but did not itch. However, I had lines of a bright red, itchy rash on both thighs near my groin. I again applied Hydrocortisone cream and took Benadryl, which helped abate the symptoms. Lymph nodes in my left armpit were quite sore as well, so I took ibuprofen.

I had periods of nausea and dizzy spells for the following week. I had an extreme migrane the night of the shot and chills throughout the next week. I did not report the symptoms to  anyone because I had not heard that these were reactions to this vaccine. After I heard that others were experiencing similar symptoms, I felt I should report my experience.

                                                Developed heart palpitations approximately 10 hours after receiving vaccine. Also insomnia  making it impossible to sleep.  Palpitations seemed to get better by 11 am the next morning but my heart rate was still elevated ( pulse 106-112).  Shortly after that ( around 11:45 am) I became extremely light headed and dizzy and felt like I was going to pass out. I also started to feel nauseous and sweaty.   I rested lying down for two hours before hearing back from my doctor&#39;s office.  I was able to control the lightheadedness and dizziness by lying down. The feeling of passing out / nearly fainting went away.  I continued to feel nauseous and my  heartrate was still elected. I started to get a headache as well.  On the advise of a nurse at my doctor&#39;s office,  my husband took me to the ER.  My EKG was normal . My heartrate was elevated.  Due to the overcrowding at the ER that day I was made to wait at least an hour and half for further evaluation.  I continued to feel light headed and slightly dizzy. My nausea and headache got much worse .  I was finally taken back to a treatment room and received IV fluids, Zofran and Tylenol.  My heartrate went back to normal and my headache and nausea improved with treatment and I was discharged around 7pm.  I continued to feel very tired and slightly lightheaded that evening. The next morning  I was much more nauseous again and still very weak feeling and slightly lightheaded. I have  continued to feel weak, very fatigued , unwell and nauseous on and off until today, April 14, which is 6 days after I was vaccinated.

Six days after the vaccine, I actually went to bed with severe cold chills which lasted several hours.  I am still experiencing intermittent periods of &#34;brain fog&#34; or at times feeling a little light headed.  Last Saturday was the only day that I haven&#39;t experienced feeling this way.  Again, it does not happen all of the time but it is bothersome. I am hopeful that after this Thursday (2 weeks will have passed since the vaccine) that symptoms will disappear. If not, I will follow up with my family practitioner.  Thank you!&#34;

                                                I woke up at 5am and when I sat up, I slumped over. I sat up again, stayed for 30 sec, went to the bathroom and when I came back, I experienced severe dizziness. For the next 4 hours, I couldn&#39;t move my head and would get a zing right up the back of my neck. When I tried to sit up again, I got really sick to my stomach. After 8 hours, I started feeling better and was able to sleep on either side, but not on my back. When I was on my back everything would start spinning again. By the afternoon of the next day, I was feeling better, but was afraid to move my head too much because I didn&#39;t want everything to start up again, so I went to the doctor. My BP was high, so he had me lay on the table. He turned my head and set it off again, so I was miserable again for the next 10 hours. After that, I felt better and was able to get up and function.

                                                I am filling out this report today because I received a follow up call from the website because I had reported loss work, loss of job, loss of activity and visits to doctors. I received the vaccine on March 12, 2021, I started having arm and shoulders symptoms the day after getting the vaccine but did not feel well that first night while trying to sleep. The symptoms worsened every day, I am in week 11 post vaccination. I have had 22 medical appointments with 3 to PCP, 13 to Physical Therapy who diagnosed left bicep tendinitis and shoulder impingement many weeks ago, 4 to acupuncture, and 1 to xray. This Thursday I finally get an MRI. I lost my job on week 7 after the vaccine, I can barely use my left arm, I live alone, I am exhausted and spend much time chasing a diagnosis or help in resolving this issue. I reported to website every time the link was sent to me. I called the Pharmacy on Day 3 and called Janssen hotline on Day 3 to report a reaction. I wrote to my doctor on Day 5 to say something was not right. By the next day I had an injection site reaction, very hard swelling in my arm, a dark red jagged surface reaction at the injection site now there is a divot there. Feeling very unwell, aches and pains, no fever. I had bad abdominal cramps that night after the injection, diarrhea for days, arm pain with swelling, joint pain in shoulder, knee, and fingers, and a  rash across my back, I had to continue to work, typing fast 9 to 10 hours a day, I am a self-employed contractor doing tax technical support and the pain in my arm grew worse daily, I was in tears trying to work. Sitting to type, to read, to drive is the worse. I can dictate into my devices but not rapidly enough for the level of my work. The worse pain in my arm and shoulder is less by avoiding typing and driving  but the injury is still there. The pain is constant even without movement.

She felt faint as she walked away and wanted to sit down. After a minute or two she fainted while sitting in the chair.  Her husband who had been with her the whole time was able to arouse her after about 20 seconds.  She felt as though she needed to vomit but was did not.  After a few minutes the patient laid down on the floor.  Had a fan positioned at them and had the lights off in our pharmacy&#39;s counseling room.  After about 30 minutes she was feeling a little better and sat up on the floor and was able to drink a little ice water.  After a few more minutes she progressed to sitting up in a chair.  At no time did she have any rash, hives, or breathing issues. she said she felt very nervous.  About an hour after the immunization the patient felt like things were better and was able to stand up and walk out on her own.  she held on to her husband&#39;s arm as a back up in case she felt faint again.

My left hand went numb and I felt the vaccine travel through my system.  I had to be helped to the 15 minute waiting area where I grew nauseous and continued to feel dizzy and light headed.  The paramedics were called but my vital signs were normal.  I came home and slept for 12 hours.  By Saturday ( 4 days ) after the vaccine, I felt like I was in a fog, couldn&#39;t think straight, and my speech become slow.  Once I got to the ER, I was having delusions and was convinced my deceased dog was sitting on my lap.

                                                4 months of new arm, shoulder and hand pain following vaccination with swelling and redness for 1month. Entire shoulder girdle burns and aches. Strong inflammatory reaction started on first night with many varied reaction symptoms for 10 days. Arm and shoulder pain remained and got worse daily for months, I now have nerve damage, weakness and loss of function. MRI showed damage, tendonitis, tears and much more, pain was severe for first 7 weeks, then I lost my job, I could no longer type for 10 hours a day. The pain progressed to pronounced weakness and poor coordination. Difficult to sleep for 4 months now.  A steroid injection given for chemical bursitis by an orthopedic doctor did not help. Physical therapy, acupuncture and a home TENS unit have helped, progress of injury healing and nerve enervation is very slow.  High medical costs. Symptoms are similar to Parsonage Turner syndrome, but two doctors said shot was given incorrectly, low and too deep, so possible SIRVA, or both. I progressively worsened for 4 months, now I am in slow recovery but I fear it will go on for years. This has affected all areas of my life. It has been difficult to get medical care and to care for myself. I live alone, there are so many things I can no longer do.  I was self-employed, now I have no income and have lost full use of my left arm.

Finally did Ultrasound of heart because of the pressure in chest, it came back ok. Having alot of junk in throat daily, constantly trying to clear it, I have to use fexofenadine daily instead of ocasional with Asthma flair ups., with shortness of breath it almost fells like emphysema, very sensetive to all smells worse then before.

                                                The injection was given into the shoulder joint rather than the deltoid muscle. This has resulted in an  inflammatory process that has caused pain and injury to my left shoulder (e.g., tendons, ligaments, bursae, nerves).  I now have persistent shoulder and upper arm pain, weakness, and limited range of motion that has worsened in the two weeks following the injection.  I am dealing with chronic shoulder and upper arm pain, and am unable to carry out daily activities that were not an issue prior to vaccination.  When the symptoms did not subside, I sought medical treatment from my primary care provider on July 15, 2021.

My home blood pressure monitoring kit provided a reading of 149/99 and a resting heart rate of 108. Normally, my blood pressure is very well maintained with my meds and hovers in the 118/75 range. My resting heart rate is usually below 70. I was going to dial 911 but within 5 minutes, my heart rate began to slow down and I felt better. When I rechecked my numbers at 8 pm, BP was down to 118/80 and resting heart rate was 70.

For the next 6 days, I had a headache, flu-like symptoms, light-headedness and nausea.  Four days after receiving the vaccine, I had a nose bleed, which is a very rare occurrence for me.

My life partner started calling my name and check my pulse (which he said was strong) ; then I came to but was really dizzy; I was nauseous and vomited for a few minutes; extremely hot/sweating; and after I stopped vomiting, then had a bowel movement (He had to aid me in getting to the bathroom).   About 20 - 25 minutes later I felt much better; everything calmed down.  I was ultimately able to fall back to sleep.

I went to the ER and they gave me fluids. I was told it was a reaction to the vaccine, but my paperwork said upper respiratory infection. My cough started out dry, I had SOB, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea and joint pain. My PCP put me on a steroid and an antibiotic Keflex (500mg, 3 times a day). I get lightheaded just walking around the house. I&#39;m still experiencing SOB, fatigue and the cough. Today is the first day that I could get up an move around. I&#39;m fine when I first wake up, but I eventually feel depleted.

Tingling and numbness of right arm for short periods after shot off and on for about first 15-20 minutes. Slight dizziness for first 15 -20 minutes lasting short periods. Nausea, briefly twice in first 20 minutes. Light-headed for the duration of 30 minute wait-and-watch period. This was the most noticeable for me, besides the intense stinging sensation in my arm. After 30 minutes of being watched in common area, I stood up to leave with my adult children and my legs were wobbly. The nurses made me sit and stay a while longer and brought me a snack. I drank my water I had brought with me. Left after an additional 15 minutes.

                                                At 4 AM the following day I woke up with a severe headache and fever. I attempted to take 2 extra strength Tylenol which seemed to trigger cyclic  vomiting every 15-20 minutes for approximately 4 hours. After this, I vomited  once an hour for another 4 hours. I was finally able to sip water and sleep after this. I also took my first temperature once feeling better and it was 99.9F. My normal temp is in the 97s and I?m sure it was much higher during the vomiting.  My fever broke approximately 12 hours after the first symptoms. Headache lasted approximately 36 hours and resolved the next day, although a milder one did come back off and on for a couple more days.  I did not have much pain in the arm I received the injection in.

On April 8th woke up very dizzy, had to lay back down for a little bit.  On April 10th woke up not being able to take a deep breath without a very bad pain in my back (it felt like my right lung)  same issue the 11th, and 12th.  This pain was not severe unless I took a deep breath.  I was able to go about my daily activities.  Today April 13th still a little tight in my lung but do not have the pain in my back that I had the last few days.

                                                Beginning approximately 10 PM (about 8 hours post-injection), I started to have chills (feet were freezing) and was exhausted. Went to bed, and slept most of the night, only waking once to urinate and to drink a small amount (approx 2 oz) of Coca Cola -- I was very nauseous and thought it would help settle my stomach. During the night I sweated profusely. At 8 AM,  I woke again and went to urinate. At that time I felt very nauseous, dizzy, and light headed. When I walked about 2 -3 feet to my bedroom, I collapsed on the floor - unconscious. My partner called EMS, they arrived minutes later. By then I was conscious. They transported me to Medical Center Emergency Room, where I remained for several hours. They indicated that my SYNCOPE was a result of dehydration. TODAY, 4/13, news of BLOOD CLOTS has compelled me to report my adverse reaction.

The first few days after the shot, I was not concerned about the soreness, I knew it was a normal side affect. But at this point I am more concerned and do feel it is an  issue to be reported. This may keep me from getting the vaccine in the future.

Stayed off my feet. Right foot became very cold. 3/30/21 Saw my primary care physician at med center. She sent me for an ultrasound at medical arts. From there I was sent to the emergency room at hospital. I asked the attending physician assistant about a correlation between the blood clot and the Covid vaccine because I had read about it being a concern in other countries. He stated that was a bunch of baloney. Was told to have a repeat ultrasound in a few days and was prescribed a 30 day starter pack of Xarelto and released.  3/30 repeat penis ultrasound of right leg showed the same results. 4/1 appointment with hematologist. Prescribe Xarelto for three months and ordered a repeat ultrasound in three months and bloodwork at that time.

                                                Progress Notes - Clinical MD at 4/15/2021  1:30 PM     HPI:  61 year old female with IBS presents with concerns about adverse reactions to vaccine which she got on 3/19/21.   Patient reports that she felt lightheaded after the vaccine when she was leaving. She got home and felt better but then that night woke up in a delirium which passed by the morning. She had some weakness in her extremities, brain fog, cold feeling, funny GI feeling and fatigue for 3 days and then was fine.   Two weeks ago she started to feel that the circulation in her lower legs was cut off with sensation of blood pooling in her legs with associated numbness and tingling. She describes it as what you feel when a tourniquet is applied to your arm.  No visible lower extremity swelling, redness and no pain.    One week ago she felt like her right hand was not working well and then left hand too. She then felt pooling in her arms like the sensation in her legs.No swelling, redness or pain.   She reports she did a hand stand and afterward felt pooling sensation in her lower abdomen which has since resolved but continues to have a prickling sensation that comes and goes.   Last night while lying on her back she felt the pooling sensation in her chest and this morning throbbing in head and chest and neck. That is when she decided to come in and be seen.    Patient denies severe headache, backache, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, bruises, unusual bleeding or rashes.   Patient has not had a physical exam with blood work since 11/9/17.

Began at around 10am. Felt like I was dying. Placed on Stroke Unit. Scans and tests all negative for stroke and Drs. thought could be panic attack or TIA. Since then my lingering effects point to TIA, Seemed to clear up around 2pm with gradual improvement through the day. Still experiencing some side effects including tinnitus, memory and word retrieval issues, fatigue, anxiety.  DO NOT HAVE PANIC ATTACKS. The only time I have had a panic attack was at 26 after the death of my mother.

I could not bend over, lie down or sit for very long without severe discomfort. I ended up seeing a chiropractor within the week who has been treating the problem over this past month.  X rays were taken. I have been treating it with ice, ibuprofen, and aspirin.

I took a Zyrtec-D the morning of the injection so I think that helped keep the swelling under control.  April 15, 2021-around 6:00 pm I became very nauseous and dizzy.  The nausea subsided by the next morning but the dizziness has continued to this day.  Had to stay in bed all day April 17 and 18 due to dizziness.

                                                Immediately after my J&amp;J vaccine, I experienced soreness to my left arm, fatigue , dizziness and a bad headache. In the middle of the night my headache kept getting worse, my eyes started to hurt really bad and I also broke out in hives. About 6 hours later my headache felt like it wanted to explode. I saw a doctor through Tele-health by  who prescribed a 6pk of steroids.  Then on Day 6, my headaches came back along with the hives and I felt really tired and the hives broke out all over my body including my crotch and ear canal. He prescribed a 6pk of steroids and I started to feel and get better. On Day9, all of my symptoms were resolved except for the fatigue. To this day I still continue to have fatigue.

                                                VERTIGO; RUNNY NOSE; FEELING SICK; This spontaneous report received from a patient concerned a 61 year old not Hispanic or Latino, African American female. The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included blood pressure, cholesterol, depression, and non smoker, and the patient had no known allergies. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805025, expiry: unknown) frequency 1 total, dose was not reported, administered on 31-MAR-2021 to right arm for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included blood pressure pill, cholesterol pill and anti-depressant.  One week after vaccination, on 07-APR-2021, the patient was feeling sick and dizzy. She said that the ambulance picked her up that day she felt really dizzy and took her to the hospital. There they performed tests on her and kept her overnight. Doctor of Medicine (MD) diagnosed her with vertigo and told her to take some over the counter medications for it. She reported that her runny nose and sick feeling went away after about a day. One to two weeks after that emergency room (ER) visit, she again went to the ER. This occurred at around 1-2:30 AM she went to the ER and MD said she had vertigo but she just stayed until the morning. MD prescribed her medicine for the vertigo, but the vertigo had not gone away. The MD there, did tests for blood clots but did not find anything but told her to take Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from runny nose, and feeling sick on 08-APR-2021, and had not recovered from vertigo.

                                                Headache and dizziness started that day. Headaches got increasingly worse during the first week along with dizziness and loss of balance. Mid second week, headaches went from moderate to very severe. The nausea and back and forth between diarrhea and constipation began. Horrible headaches. PCP put me on zolfram 1 pill 1x a day. That did not help. I was then put on zolfram 2x a day. I was also put on pepcid AC 2x a day. I also stayed on tramadol for pain. It seemed to help. It delayed my nucala. At the end of week 3, I went in for my Nucala for my asthma. Within hours of receiving that shot, the side effects came back. With the medication, I was beginning to feel better but the Nucala shot brought them all rushing back. Week 4 was even more miserable. I was put on 10mg dextramethazone. My last dose was yesterday morning and today I woke up dizzy again with a massive headache and a sour stomach. I am still taking pepcid AC. My dr. office is working on a plan.

Fever lasted 2 days and fever lasted for 5 days. 5/10 the arm was sore and there was a 6x6? huge rash. 5/24- 5/26 I had a rash that I kept under control with Benadryl. 5/29 my saliva glands began to swell and that?s why I went to the Doctor. The Dr sent me to an ENT and Rheumatologist.

I had not had this before &amp; it is quite unnerving. I have been doing PT for the dizziness &amp; it has pretty much subsided. I have also had pain (no rash or lymph discomfort or swelling)  just muscular pain in my upper right arm. This started about a month after the vaccination. It is in the arm muscle NOT the bursa. It happens when I have not moved the arm for awhile &amp; I reach for something, etc.. the pain is not severe but obvious  (0 to 10 it is about a 4) &amp; goes down to about a 1 after I move the arm around for 30 seconds or so. I have also had pain &amp; a bit of weakness in my legs &amp; a sharp pain in my left beast (not my chest - the upper left quadrant about 1&#34; below my armpit &amp; 3 inches in the breast tissue. It is a single sharp pain (0 to 10 = 7) and only stays for a few minutes.

Before the injection I discussed the fact that I have many allergies and my concern that the form didn?t ask which vaccines I had had anaphlaxic reactions to. My tongue immediately became slightly swollen.  By the time I arrived home an hour later, I could barely left my left arm, I was sick to my stomach and almost started to dry heave; it passed in about 10 minutes. My tongue remained swollen until 7:00 pm 6/30/2021.  My arm remained extremely sore until 7/01/2021; the injection site still hurts a little as of 07/05/2021..  on 07/02/2021 I had chills until approximately 5:30 pm.  I carry Epi-pens should I need to self administer.

                                                8 hours after getting the vaccine I started feeling very cold. It came on me all of a sudden.  Shaking, shivering, teeth chattering ensued along with generally feeling very unwell.  (Similar to how I felt years ago after having surgery)  This progressed during the night to fever, chills, extreme body aches, stabbing pains in the head, heart racing, dizziness and nausea.  After 12 hours I started to feeling improvement.  At the 16 hour mark I am really tired and nauseous but feel like I&#39;m coming back.  Probably the worst I&#39;ve ever felt.  We considered going to the ER in the night.

I woke up and I was talking gibberish. I was aware that nothing I said was making sense. I went to bed and slept almost 24 hours. I woke up feeling wiped out but I wasn&#39;t confused and I was talking normal again. Right arm hurt and is numb. ( right side of my body typically is kind of numb but the right arm seemed more so numb after the vaccine)

                                                The actual injection itself was so painful that I almost passed out. It hurts so badly while the needle was in my arm and when she took it out it was worse. I was in such pain that I began to sweat profusely and apparently I turned white and began dry heaving. This was all within a minute or so.  I really thought I was going to pass out. A woman with a tag that said pharmacist came rushing over. She got a reclining chair with wheels, they help me into it and then took me to a recovery room. After a few more minutes of sweating and dry heaving I began feeling better.  The pharmacist got me some paper towels so I could dry myself off as I was drenched in sweat. I asked her for a bottle of water. I waited the 15 minutes and came home.  They never checked my vital signs. Once I got home, I laid down and slept for 15 hours. I was fine the next day and my arm was never sore.  Could  the shot have hit a nerve? I?ve never felt such acute pain.

Mild flu the next day with  general Malaise.  The chills were so intense that I was constricted for much of the time with little relieve. I would call them violent chills with a tetany kind of full body involvement.  Never have  I experienced chills like I have described. I?ve never had a reaction to vaccines and tend have a high tolerance. I did not contact my physician but spoke to colleagues who suggested  report the experience.

                                                I started running a fever and aching very bad Saturday morning. By Saturday afternoon my fever was up to 103.5.  I did not want to go to the hospital, but I came very close to calling. I decided to try ice packs on my forehead, neck and chest. I have never had a fever this high, or ached this bad. I don&#39;t know how long it took for my fever to come down, but finally came down to 102.5, where it stayed throughout the rest of the day and into Sunday.  I continued to use the ice packs throughout Sunday. I drank a lot of water and took Tylenol for fever and pain. I had a fever for three days. Today, Tuesday, 3/17/2021, I am very light headed.  I was diagnosed with covid-19 on Dec 29th 2020.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the single dose at 10:40.  In approximately 11 minutes I started to experience shortness of breath.  I thought it was my N95 mask so decided to head to the car after my 15 minute wait period was completed.  After sitting down in the car I started the following symptoms:  shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, swelling of face, dizziness, weakness.  I sit in the car for approximately 15 minutes then headed home.  I had a driver (thank goodness).  I continued to have symptoms and what felt like elevated blood pressure (I did not have access to a pressure cuff).  After resting at my driver&#39;s house for about 5 hours I felt better and headed home.  The next morning the symptoms were less but still present.  In addition I had a slight rash on my stomach that wrapped around my back.  After approximately 48 hours all of the symptoms subsided.  My blood pressure had returned to normal also.  All swelling went down.

Per pt&#39;s visitor her color had returned to normal, pt still feels a little shaky. Pt rested another 5 mins, repeated vitals and pts BP was elevated. Discussed with pt and visitor that due to her hx of HTN and her already being on BP meds, pt should be seen in ER and EMS called. Explained that she should have an EKG done b/c of flutters and HTN along with headache. Educated pt on importance of being seen in ED. Gave pt and visitor time to discuss suggestion, when returning pt states, &#34;Talked to niece who is EMT and said I should be fine if I just went home, rested, ate, and checked BP and took another BP pill (1/2) like suggested with doc before getting ahold of physician. All they&#39;ll do in ED is continue to check BP&#34;. Advised pt that ED would do more than that. Pt refused EMS and wished to go home. Pt visitor stated that they would watch patient and if anything changed take to ED. Patient left clinic in wheelchair and assisted to vehicle. Pt denies any symptoms that she initially presented with but states she just feeling weak.

                                                I started experiencing dizziness when my head turned in a specific position. This began about one week after the vaccination. At the next VSAFE check I reported that I was having some dizziness and tiredness. However, I saw a doctor on April 2 and he diagnosed me with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo and treated me in his office using the Epley Maneuver. The dizziness was cured and I am not experiencing it any longer. I do not believe it was associated with the vaccination but had not seen my doctor when I completed the report on VSAFE.

                                                Four days after I received the vaccine (this week Tuesday), I suddenly felt very dizzy and faintish.  I sat down until the dizzy spell passed.  I felt very cold and clammy and nauseous.  My hands were very shaky. I  felt very weak and very tired so I slept the whole day.  Today I woke up and felt the same dizziness, very cold hands and nauseous.  Both times I had diarrhea.  I have never had dizzy spells before so I know this has to be vaccine related.

                                                almost two weeks later my arm is still very sore at injection site. the next morning after the vaccine when i was at work i had to leave my classroom because i felt sick.  i felt nauseated, sweaty, light headed, short of breath and my heart was pounding like i had been running a marathon.  i thought i was gonna have a heart attack.  i HAD to go outside for fresh cool air and sit down. i was also applying a cold compress, drinking cool water and taking very deep breaths i was able to return to work in about 15 minutes.  i continued to feel nauseated for the rest of that day and the next.

I expected this, but a few days later I was still having what I describe as migraine type headaches and at one point I was sweating profusely, dizzy massive headache with not only nausea, but  dry heaving so bad I could barely get to my medication and seriously thought it would never subside.  I continued with headaches up until today April 14.  This is the first day I have not had a headache.  I contacted my vascular doctor as I had a blood clot several years ago and he has prescribed Eliquis twice a day for the next 2 weeks.   Today marks 2 weeks and like I said, it&#39;s the first day I have not had a headache

Began having a dry cough, went to nurse to as if normal, she said no, she started monitoring me. Still had cough, then became light headed and nausea. She gave me 25 mg of  Benadryl,  coughing continued, breathing became rapid, then I was given  shot of epi,  I became dizzy again and couldn?t complete a sentence. Words were slurred, heart beat racing. EMT?s were called. Received another shot of  Benadryl. It did not counteract anything. Received another shot of epi. Had uncontrollable shakes and hard to breathe or speak.  Was difficult to get BP reading due to shaking. Finally got reading of 196/99. EMT listened to heart and lungs. Said all was good. Taken to ER for monitoring of heart, Lungs and BP. Was there for approximately 2 hours u til shakes and BP were good.

                                                On Tuesday, April 6, 2021, about 11:45 am, I felt a sudden sharp pain in the right temple area just above eye level and about 2 inches posterior.  I also felt some dizziness and wondered if I was having a stroke or some type of arterial inflammation.  At the time I was treating a patient and wondered if I was going to have to leave to go home.  I did get through the rest of my workday but had difficulty concentrating.  I had recurring waves of pain in the same area several times that day and into the evening, was considering alerting my adult daughter that I might need to go to a hospital.  Fortunately, resting and increased fluids seemed to resolve the pain and it was mostly gone by the next day.

                                                Sudden onset extreme dizziness/vertigo. So severe and sudden I called 911 because I felt I might lose consciousness. Followed by nausea and violent vomiting. (EMT Vitals were all normal and they didn&#39;t think it was an allergic reaction this long after vaccine so I declined hospital ER visit.)  After several hours of severe dizziness I developed violent chills with heavy breathing that lasted 20 minutes then stopped.  Much improved after 24 hours but two days later I still have considerable dizziness. Headaches occurred Earlier in the week but none with onset of dizziness. Otherwise I experienced the typical fatique and flulike vaccine side effects with no pain at injection site about 2 days after vaccination that lasted several days.

                                                2 hours after receiving the vaccine, I grew exhausted and had to sleep into late evening and was chilled,  had a fever of 101 and developed severe pain and inflammation on the top of my collar bone that was feverish and migrated toward my shoulder region on the same side as my vaccine. Ibuprofen would not help with the pain but helped with the fever. My mind told me that I had things to tend to the next day, but still was forced to sleep off and on for 2 more days. After a week and a half, not only did I have thirst, but also food didn&#39;t taste right and was metallic.  This lasted for 2 days and finally my taste was restored. The exhaustion lasted off and on for 2 weeks and I just listened to my body. The pain and inflammation on my collar bone has subsided 4 days ago but still have pain in my shoulder when I sleep.  On April 5 around 8:30 a.m. a nasty virus hit me out of the blue. I grew week and tired and had to go to bed. I slept all day until around 9:00 p.m. and woke to uncontrollable diarrhea and fainting spell while in the bathroom. I had abominable pain and nausea that last for a half hour and then I returned to bed. The next 2 days, I was week and exhausted but continued with my regular routine.  My equilibrium is still affected from time to time.

Today she woke up and had no balance with the other symptoms listed. They went over her symptoms with her and gave her a rapid COVID test , according to their test she was found to be POSITIVE for COVID-19.  Just can&#39;t understand this as she received her vaccination on the 7th.

They took me in a room to lay down and said my blood pressure had dropped vary low.  After an out of doing better I just needed t get home. So another hour passes and I get home, go directly to bed and what seems like a bad flu begins.   That night my temperature continues to climb, the aches and headache are horrible.  I continue fevers for 3 nights.  Feel a little better and then with 2 days it relapse and all starts again.  I am in bed for 1 and 1/2 weeks, then stay home due to continued headache, dizziness.  After 3 weeks the dizziness continues and I then start getting an aching pain in the back of my left leg.  Seeing my doctor on May 11th and hope to discuss.

                                                Old injuries are flaring up again. In 2010, I dropped a 45-pound Olympic weightlifting bar from overhead onto my foot and fractured 3 bones. That was treated and healed (cast and flexible cam walker). In 2013 I had surgery on my left wrist for Derkervains. That healed up just fine also. All of the sudden, both past injuries have flared up again. I had foot pain so bad that I couldn&#39;t walk for a day. An Xray shows no damage. Yesterday, my wrist has flared up and is very painful. I have not seen a doctor about that. My foot is improving. I think it will bounce back. I now suspect that my wrist will also improve. My hypothesis is that the vaccine has challenged my immune system enough that old injuries are flaring up and then calming back down again. It&#39;s very odd. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s significant, but thought I should report it, in case my experience matters.

I&#39;ve taken ibuprofen  and am using ice compresses, but it doesn&#39;t help enough. So far I&#39;ve missed 3 days of work.  I cannot dress myself, so I know I can&#39;t drive.  Please advise. I also massage the sore area to keep  my arm from stiffening up.

                                                6 days after vaccine after having no symptoms at all I suddenly felt nauseous about  9 p.m.  Went to the bathroom and can&#39;t remember what happened next as I passed out.  Fell hard and knocked shower out of track.  Woke up throwing up massively.  My husband ran in and helped me.  I threw up a lot and had chills.  After cleaning up, went to bed and piled on blankets.  Woke up again sometime in the 11 to midnight range and threw up once more.  Still chilled.  About 3 a.m. I woke up and removed all the blankets as I felt okay again.   I never found a place to report this in my daily reports as within 24 hours I felt normal again.  I am 100% positive this was a reaction to the vaccine.  I did not need to seek medical treatment as it passed within 6 hours or so.

                                                Patient received J and J covid vaccine on 3/7/21. She did not feel well for the next few days and had the following symptoms: headache, fatigue, nausea, body aches, loss of taste. She recovered after a few days and was doing well until 6/11/21. She began having the following symptoms: migraine headache, nausea, dizziness, loss of appetite, blurred vision, weakness, loss of taste, muscle weakness and joint pain. She went to ER on 6/13/21. They did a cat scan and ekg, both came back normal. They did not do a covid test. She then went to her regular Dr. on 6/15/21 and he gave her topiramate. He did not do a covid test. She was off work for a week and returned to work on 6/18/21. She is feeling better now and has worked for the last two days. She came to pharmacy and told me what was happening and she thinks that her symptoms are from the original J and J covid vaccine on 3/7/21 and she is worried that she may have recurring symptoms for the vaccine

On my drive home it kept hurting. Finally on 04/17/2021, I was concerned because that was the time the media was mentioning blood clots  from the vaccine. Because my arm, my shoulder hurt, and under my arm still continued to hurt I went into the ER. The doctor did not feel any abnormality in my arm.  Till this day I still feel soreness in your arm and shoulder and under my arm. I can&#39;t extend my arm or use my arm. I use it cautiously, if I use it. I have had 3 or 4 visits with my doctor and she put me on methylpred 4 mg/  triage pack. It helped  somewhat with the pain, but I still had soreness. So she prescribed  Methocarban 500 mg. I just took it for 3 days. and it upset my stomach and gave me diarrhea .  Now I have an MRI that is scheduled, but I don&#39;t know when at this point.  I have to see if my insurance will cover it. I&#39;m still pursuing to see why my soreness is persisting.

I also had a migraine  mid morning every day after the menstrual period. They have lessened now (tapered and mostly stopped by end of June 2021).

Where she injected me was very high up on my arm almost close to the top.  The pain at injection site was quite sore for the first few days and then went away for the most part for a day or two but has now come back much worse.  It hurts to lift my arm or move it and feels like I&#39;ve lost strength to raise my arm.   I am in constant pain now and my arm around the injection site is painful when I press down especially on the bony area.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported.  The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included seasonal allergies, and codeine allergy. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1802068, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 05-MAR-2021 to left arm as prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 06-MAR-2021, after vaccination, she felt fine all day and night. The next morning she woke up and felt sick. She had nausea, headache, hive under eye. She laid back down and tried to sleep. A few hours later, she woke up to use the bathroom. She was very nauseous and dizzy. She lost consciousness and fell trying to get to the bathroom. She fell on her bed and was uninjured. The paramedics took her to the hospital. She was given medication for nausea, headache, and IV fluids. She gave blood for lab tests and they came back normal. No COVID test was administered. When she felt better, she was released. A few days later, she discovered her tongue was sore and red. She called her primary care physician (PCP). PCP said the red and sore tongue was probably related to allergies. Two weeks later, her tongue was not sore, but still red. They advised her to get a second opinion with another HCP. She was going to visit her allergy specialist.. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea, fatigue, inflammation on left eye, and small hives under eye on MAR-2021, and vomiting on 07-MAR-2021, and had not recovered from canker sore under tongue, and the outcome of fall on bed was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged).  Additional information was received from the patient on 23-Mar-2021. The following information was updated and incorporated into case narrative: Patient&#39;s medical history added as seasonal allergies and codeine allergy, Vaccination site as left arm added; Additional events as small hives under eye, fall on bed; lab test of blood work added; Event outcome of loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea, and fatigue was updated to recovered/resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: v1: Follow up information received updates  patient&#39;s medical history (seasonal allergies and codeine allergy), Vaccination site as left arm; Additional events (small hives under eye and fall on bed), laboratory test (Blood Work); Event outcome  (loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea and fatigue was updated to recovered/resolved). This updated information does not alter prior causality assessment of reported events 20210323730-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S-headache, nausea and fatigue. These events are labeled and are therefore considered potentially related. 20210323730-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S-loss of consciousness, fainted, heart racing, dizzy, vomiting, canker sore under tongue. These events are considered unassessable. The events have a compatible/suggestive temporal relationship, are unlabeled, and have unknown scientific plausibility. There are no information on any other factors potentially associated with the events.

The next morning I was very tired. As time progressed, I felt like I HAD to be horizontal. No energy at all. No appetite at all. Took my temperature and was shocked to see it at 101.4º. Pharmacist suggested I take aspirin, which I took one, and then another one several hours later. It did help and reduced the fever to 99º.  The following day the temperature remained at 99º but under 100º. (I never took any other aspirin other than the two that I mentioned). The third day I was good to go!

I had a little headache. 4/2/21 Day 3: Morning was slow.  I noticed that I was tired.  Headache was stronger.  I took Ibuprofen 400mg. By mid day, I was on the couch the rest of the day.  My body was telling me to rest.  So I did.

I had to regulate my breathing by slowing it down. When I opened my eyes the light was so bright I had to keep them closed. I thought I was going to faint. I finally decided to put my head between my legs and then I started too pullout of it.  Very scary feeling.   This lasted for 10min.

                                                On March 8th received the J&amp;J shots, March 9, 10th &amp; 11th was extremely nauseous in the morning.  On the 12th had severe chest pains which I chalked up to a very bad case of heart burn.  On March 24th, while driving I had two major (what I thought at the time) was panic attacks...body started shaking, heart was beating like crazy, couldn&#39;t catch my breath, felt like I was going to pass out or die.  Had to pull over twice to calm myself down.  (From what I read this could be a sign of a blood clot but I am not a doctor.)  Had minor heart burn until April 5th....which ironically was the end of my 28 days until the vaccine fully kicked in.  Just reporting what happen.  I feel fine now.

Approximately a week later, the patient experienced stomach cramps and diarrhea and 1.5 weeks later she had foggy feeling in head and &#34;believes the vaccine is contaminated&#34;, had fever blister, facial pain and vertigo. Approximately 3.5 weeks after being vaccinated the patient experienced pressure choking and difficulty swallowing. A throat (ENT) specialist was unable to diagnose and they felt there was some autoimmune effects. A month after being vaccinated the patient experienced stomach burning sensation, night sweats and tooth pain. Given the close temporal relationship and the nature of the events, the events of sinus inflammation, sensation of pressure in ear, injection site lump, chills, felt ill, injection site pain and fatigue are considered related to the vaccination. The insufficient information precludes a meaningful medical assessment of the remaining events, including &#34;autoimmune effects&#34;. The events will be assessed further when additional information is received.

Went to urgent care on unspecified date. NP examined me and discovered a lump in my arm. Both the lump and the vaccination site hurt when she pressed on them. She prescribed presdone and gave me a work order for a vascular ultrasound to be performed on my left arm. I went on unspecified date for the scan. It was discovered that a DVT blood clot had formed in my brachial vein in the left arm. I was then prescribed eliquis, 20 mg a day for 7 days and told not to take the predesone. NP called my pcp, his office immediately called me and asked me to come in as they are concerned about the high dosage of the eliquis.

                                                I experienced usual side effects, fever and chills but the entire reason is that I have swelling and edema in both feet and ankles enough so to concern doctors.  I went to  clinic on 03-26-2021 for evaluation.  They put me on 3 day steroids. I went back to First med which they put me on a 6 day course of medication of steroids. I then went to my podiatrist, of my right ankle, I was scanned for blood clots but no blood clots were found. My exams only identify swelling and edema. I can only take NSAID&#39;S. I have to get up wait a few hours to move. My ankle swelling and edema nerve decreases and my feet hurt so bad when I apply pressure. I had an MRI done as well and I am very upset that they cant find why I can not walk without pain and swelling. My doctors at this point do not what to do for me and I would like some answers.  To this day, I am still having  swelling and edema to both of my feet and ankles.

                                                The injection did hurt quite a bit more than other injections I have had in the past but it began to feel better and I sat in a chair and was on my phone to send a message, spoke to a stranger who was looking for where to go, and was ok until the feeling of fainting began 10 minutes after the shot. I put my head between my knees but it did not help so I called for help and eventually was helped onto the floor to lie down which began to help. I had vision trouble and hearing trouble and could not speak. I was told my neck became bright red as my face grew white and my hands twitched and my eyes rolled around. I found out later that I had also peed my pants. I have fainted only once before in 1989, and found this reaction pretty frightening although I do not believe it happened as a result of anxiety or fear, the adverse effect itself was frightening and unexpected- not listed on any paperwork I received and was not aware it could occur.

I felt lightheaded and needed to sit for awhile after the shot. The next night I started getting pain in my right arm and I couldn&#39;t move it. My nerve endings in my arm, shoulder, and clavicle felt like they were on fire. The lymph nodes under my right arm and neck were swollen. I had three swollen lymph nodes in my neck, but one went down, and I still have two swollen nodes in my neck. My quality of life has suffered because the pain in my arm is so bad.

I did feel like it wouldn&#39;t be smart to drive so my husband drove me home. I had a slight fever that night and next day, I felt super tired. I scheduled an ultrasound for 1 week following the shot, My ears kind of freaked out after the ultrasound and was itching and burning, I also got a rash around my neck after ultrasound. The rash felt like fire. Allegra helped with the itching. Faint rash traveled down my arms. The Dr. put me on prednisone the rash spread to my back and upper legs. Benadryl was not helpful. It lasted approximately 2 weeks.

                                                I had COVID like symptoms again. After that I was doing good for about two weeks, but I still had a stiff neck. I have had a stiff neck for about 6 weeks now. I have had steroid medication provide for me and I felt better this lasted for about two weeks. After this I have went back to the hospital because I have not been able to stand, or barely make a fist.

                                                About 5 days after the shot, I was still having a lot of fatigue, but I developed severe headaches, like someone was sticking a knife in my head, and I was having bouts of light headedness.  I am a person who never has headaches.   Because the issue of the blood clots came about with the J&amp;J, I ended up, because of the severe headeaches  had to have a brain MRI to rule out the blood clots.  I did not have any.  But the headaches were very much a problem and the light headedness.  I had to leave area for the summer, and now came to another area.  I still was not feeling right.  The bad headaches subsided, but I was till getting the lightheadedness with a slight headache after almost every day.  II also had a full blood panel done on April 8.  It is showing my thyroid is low and now have to be on Thyroid medication.  I just had full blood work done in March, and all my blood work was normal.  I also have noticed that my arthritis in my hands is exacerbated.  And sometimes my feet go numb when I am riding my horse.  And in the morning, my arms and legs ache.  My  BP was a little elevated as well. I never have had high blood pressure.     I am 63 years old and have always had great health.   Since I had the covid shot,  I have had nothing but problems.   If I had to do it over again, I WOULD NOT have gotten the shot.  I only got it because my daughter was having a baby and insisted even though I had the virus back in October.

                                                It began with being light-headed and difficulty walking on March 25th. On April 14 I had my first &#34;seizure like&#34; event as I was going to teach school. I had Upper arm tremors and difficulty speaking and walking. Sent by ambulance to the emergency room. Released later that day and given meds for UTI which was later deemed a misdiagnosis by Dr.  Didn&#39;t go to work as I continued to  have difficulty walking and had headaches and overall weakness. Saw Dr. on April 20th.  Had to use wheelchair to attend the office visit and was given blood tests to see what was causing my condition. Had high blood pressure.  She also advised me to see a neurologist and heart doctor. ON April 20th had to go back to ER as I had the smae seizure like event!On April 22nd I visited Dr. office (heart doctor). Blood pressure was off on this day as well and I stayed at clinic until it was better. Was given a heart monitor to wear for 24 hours. Heart was fine after wearing the monitor. Visited Neurologist and was given EEG and CT CTA tests. All came back fine.

                                                Probably immediately, I was lightheaded and woozy. As soon as she put it in my arm I could taste it and I felt like I was going to vomit. She kept me there for 45 minutes to keep an eye on me. As a disclaimer, I am a vegan and very earthy, I do not take any drugs or anything like that. When I was driving home the lightheadedness got so bad that I had to pull over and sat for 15-20 minutes. I called my brother and he told me to get something to eat. I just had some steamed vegetables. I came home, ate and drank a lot of water to try and get the wooziness to pass. I did not have an unusual amount, no more than I would usually drink. Then after the last bottle of water I had, I started getting more queasy and started to feel dizzy. I then vomited all over my self from head to toe. That lasted for two or three hours and then after that I was dry heaving. That happened on Friday, on Saturday I was too afraid to eat anything I only had toast and a smoothie. On Sunday I was just so woozy and lightheaded and exhausted. I didn&#39;t feel chills or anything though. My brother brought me soup on Sunday and I did have some broth. I also started drinking a little bit more water. The water didn&#39;t taste good though - it tasted like the vaccine so I did not want to have it. I did not workout at all for that week, I was just so tired. I felt like I could sleep for a month and just not get up. I normally workout five days a week. I got an IV with fluids for hydration and a glutathione push on 7/2/2021. On the following Saturday 7/3/2021, I was still lightheaded. Now, I still am extremely tired and there are days that focusing takes more energy than it typically does. My mouth feels like I have cotton balls in it, the nausea and the lightheadedness is still present, but the tiredness is the worst. I normally run everyday but I cannot even do that at all, walking is hard enough. I just had another IV today 7/14/2021. When this started happening, I did contact my DR but I am unable to get in yet, I need to schedule for a full blood panel and see the DR.

                                                Symptoms from improperly administered vaccinations - known as SIRVA, for &#34;shoulder injury related to vaccine administration&#39;&#39; - include chronic pain, limited range of motion, nerve damage, frozen shoulder (the inability to move the shoulder) .  I received a COVID-19 vaccination (2nd dose as part of the Janssen study )..  When the nurse injected the needle into my arm it HURT.  I started to leap off the table but she told be to stop and 2 nurses stepped forward to steady me.  I told her it hurt extremely bad but she didn&#39;t withdraw the needle.  Another nurse handed me a tissue to wipe the tears from my eyes.  The injection  hurt, more so than the usual injection. In the days that followed, the pain in my right shoulder worsened. Initially, I dismissed it as typical post-shot soreness. But it didn?t go away.  Months later, it still hurts. The sports medicine doctor says I have excess fluid buildup in the bursa.  He withdrew the fluid.  I&#39;m still going for physical therapy 3 times a week to get back range of motion and strength in my arm.  I?m convinced this occurred because the nurse injected the vaccine too high on my arm. I had no symptoms before the shot, and pain has persisted since.

Very bad chills and fever.  By 9:30 took 1 500mg Tylenol.   Little sleep that night.  Felt very unwell next day (3/9) including headache.  At noon I could get up and get some food.  By 1pm fever subsided completely, but temporarily.  Fever came back by 4pm, but only to 98.6 (&#43;1.3 above normal).  Took another 500mg Tylenol.  Night 2 slept well.

The muscle is still affected and strained after 6 days. I waited a half hour at the site and got into my car at 3:45. On the drive home within 30 minutes my face started to itch and turn red, then my mouth inside started to itch, then my eyes started to itch. After that my throat started to feel gravely, so I took 75 mgs of gel cap benedryl. This is what I feel and take upon getting stung by a bee. I also took my albuterol inhaller two puffs which I also always have on me because of my asthma. I was sleepy but had dinner and went to be. I did not feel that I had to take more benedryl during the night.

                                                I experienced fever, chills, tiredness, and headache approximately five hours after administration of the vaccine on 3-10-21. Symptoms became severe within 30 minutes thereafter, at which time I experienced difficulty standing. After five hours with no improvement, I used my home blood pressure monitor to check my BP and HR; BP was high for me, 120/90 sustained, and HR varied between 135 and 150, with 143 being the most consistent value after multiple readings. I seemed to be experiencing a &#34;severe allergic reaction&#34; per the instructions I was given and called 9-1-1. I was transported to Hospital, treated in ER, and then admitted to the intermediate care unit. I was discharged to home on 3-12-21.

                                                Immediately after the shot, I felt dizzy and started to sweat throughout my body including my hands.  I waited more than 40 minutes to see if improved but it was exactly the same. Didn&#39;t get better or worse. I did not report it immediately because it was not alarming and I did not feel bad. It was just my head that was spinning a little bit and sweating. After waiting more than 45 minutes I decided to drive home because the dizziness was not that strong. I would say it was like a 45% dizzyness if I have to calculate how I felt. The sweating passed after 4 hours and at soon as I arrived home I went to bed and relax. It is now 6:08 pm and the dizziness has improved considerably. I would calculate now about 10% of that vertigo feeling. It is getting better and better. I just wanted to point out that in no time I was feeling bad. Everything was just in my hearing labyrinth internal with balance. I also felt 20 minutes of echoing in my ears about 2 hours ago.

                                                I wasn&#39;t sure how to indicate which dose I&#39;m reporting on.  It&#39;s my second dose of a vaccine but my first of Johnson &amp; Johnson.  My first shot for Covid-19 was a Moderna shot, to which I had a bad reaction (immediate and prolonged lightheadedness reported already on this site).  My doctor advised me that my second dose should be a Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, as per information he had received from the CDC.  So, 28 days after the first shot I had the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.  I experienced the expected side effects of body aches, chills, headache--no big deal on day 2, but on day 3, I started some lightheadedness, as did my daughter who had the shot the same day.  Her lightheaded subsided the next day, but mine continued into day 4 and got worse when it became accompanied by pressure in my head/ears, and it felt like I was talking in a tunnel with echoing.  I couldn&#39;t function the rest of the day.  Today, the head pressure is not there, but the lightheadedness and shakiness are still there.  I hope I fully recover from these shots, but I don&#39;t have a lot of hope.

                                                Patient received J&amp;J COVID Vaccine 4/12/21 around 12:05 pm. Patient waited in waiting area and complained to her husband about feeling dizzy and might faint. Pharmacists went to aid the patient and lay her down gently, monitored her blood pressure which was high at the time, once patient sat up her BP decreased, it fluctuated the whole time, EMT was called and once they arrived and monitored her, they said the cause of her fainting was due to her blood pressure. Patient was alert and responsive the whole time. Patient was unsure if she took her BP medicine this morning.

I was unable to straighten leg when lying in bed.  I managed to stand up and walk it off, but with pain as severe as in January when knee was replaced.  Leg continued to be sore, then Monday night I didn&#39;t have the same issue w/bending, but I did wake early with horrible stabbing pains in knee.  I treated with Tylenol, Alprozalan &amp; Ice.

                                                2 weeks post inoculation developed burning sensation/tingling /pain from armpit to thumb; some tingling in thumb - sensation more like nerve pain vs muscle pain.  After two days gradually improved.  Muscle strength not affected, but movement in most directions elicited sharp pain coursing down arm.  Gradually improving to pain over the deltoid near injection site;  as of 19 days since initial pain motility much improved but still periodically throbs and sensitive to pressure and certain movements.   No treatment except restricting use of arm and time.  10 hrs post inoculation developed chills, myalgia and headache.  Chills and myalgia resolved in a few hours; an aspirin the next day resolved the headache.    This reaction was not unexpected.  Did not have pain at injection site until 2 weeks post injection.

                                                During the night I felt like I had a fever, chills and body aches.   And the next morning after I woke up needing to use the restroom, got up but started feeling dizzy and fainted for about 2minutes.  EMT was called and once they arrived I began vomiting and my BP was super low. During the transport to the hospital I vomited again and was given antinausea meds.  At the ER I was given IV fluids, chest xray, EKG and blood was drawn and I was released after a few hours of monitoring

She reported these on 4/19/21. I advised her to contact her PCP to get evaluated for the signs/symptoms that she is experiencing to rule out anything severe. She did not seem to understand and asked to speak with the manufacturer. She said that she would contact the manufacturer and walked away.  When I attempted to contact her again today on 4/20/21, the phone number she provided to us has been disconnected and we have no means of reaching her at this point in time. I am hoping she heeded my advice and contacted her PCP to get evaluated.

The morning after the vaccine I felt lightheaded and weird. I had heart palpitations and I was queasy. I started to walk back to my bedroom. The next thing I knew I woke up on the floor after passing out. After that I felt like my body was crumpled and I was disoriented. I could barely walk but I made it to the couch, and I had bumps in the front and back of my head near my ear. I was in a lot of pain and I think I was in shock. My foot was painful, and I saw a foot doctor. I had a doctor?s appointment and they did an EKG and they sent me to a Neurologist. It has been seven weeks I still have dizziness and nausea and it is hard to focus. I also have pain in my knee and my right arm.

                                                I tested positive for Covid-19 with no severe symptoms in February of 2021. One week after the vaccine on 04/09/2021 I broke out in hives after eating a meal. The hives were mostly on the right side of my body but there were some on the left. I also had some numbness and tingling in my mouth. I used some anti itch cream, and the hives were mostly gone the next day. Twelve days after the vaccine I started to unusual vision symptoms which included wavy zig-zag lines in my vision. My doctor advised that they were Ocular Migraines. I had a headache at the same time, but I have never had Migraines before. I was also fatigued with a little dizzy and nauseous. The headache lasted for one day, but I still felt a little nauseous the next day. The feeling of fatigue and tired ness lasted for about six weeks. Two to three days after Ocular Migraines I started to notice a bright red rash on the right side of my back. It quickly spread around my side to the midline and then up my right side to my Bra line in front. I consulted my doctor on 04/19/2021 and he identified the rash as Shingles I was prescribed Acyclovir 800mg for 7 days and then an additional 5 days. I saw my Dermatologist on 05/06/2021 and he said that the Shingles were still active so I was Prescribed Valacyclovir. The Shingles lasted about six weeks total with some fatigue before I felt normal. I still have some visible signs of the rash on my back.

                                                Six hours after the vaccine I got chills, headache, stomach upset and swelling in my lower face and throat. I had body aches all over my body but no fever or pain at the injection site. Those symptoms lasted for ten days. I went to ER. I was given medication for the nausea and pain. The chills were a little better by then. The medication helped with everything but the headache. The headache is constant at the back right of my head. I then get other head pain at the same time in my temples on the left. It is a sharp shooting pain. I get flashes of light in my eyes and my eyes start twitching at the sides. I also get pain at the top of my head on the left hand side on occasionally which comes after the temple pain. I sometimes get head pain on the right side with deep concentration. I have recently started to get tremors in my right hand. Sometimes the headache wakes me up at night. I wake up every day with a headache and it has been thirteen weeks. I can not drive or concentrate. I have seen a neurologist but I am still having trouble scheduling scans. I have tried some prescription pain medication and it did not work. I have taken two courses of steroids.

                                                On the same day I got the vaccine and the next day, I had fever, body aches, and malaise; I was in bed for 2 days. I had a lack of energy that was worse than it had been before the vaccine. On or about 4/14/2021, I woke up at about 2:00AM with chest pain, pain in the left shoulder and in the left side of the neck. The symptoms subsided after some time. I had low oxygen saturation levels; I knew this, because I used a pulse oximeter that had been used by my late husband. The low oxygen saturation levels have been ongoing ever since, and I have had periods of rapid heart rate and oxygen levels that are even lower than the low levels I have experienced since the vaccine. I have also had periods of chest pains at times, so my PCP referred me to both a pulmonologist and a cardiologist.

The first 1/2 of the vaccine was given easily IM to the left deltoid and then the patient complained of severe arm pain, tensed her muscles, and the last 0.25ml was difficult to inject. Then the patient became hypotensive 90/45, dizzy, and felt like she was going to pass out. She was laid in the supine position, given a cool cloth for her forehead and monitored for approx. 45 minutes. Her blood pressure remained 90/60, 96/56 at discharge. Her heart rate ranged from 55-65, regular. Her son came to take her home as we did not feel comfortable with the patient driving. The patient was continuously monitored by the NPs and APCT. She ambulated without difficulty and was discharged home. She was given information for V-safe to report her reaction and advised to follow up in the ER for any SOB, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, syncope, CP, etc.

I tried to go back to sleep. When I woke up, I took it easy. I did get the chills and sweats thru the day; skin turns really red (MCAS). That symptoms still comes and goes. The chills, regulating body temperature, has flared back up after being dormant for years.  3/30 I saw MD. She wanted to defer for 4-6 weeks after vaccination to see if symptoms were still persisting or leveling out.  I have since canceled every sort of appt since then as I don&#39;t have the energy.  *I am on the very tail end of an opioid withdrawal; tramadol. I have taken for 6 years, 400 mg weened down to 100 mg this last year, down to 12.5.

                                                At the time, I had very mild injection site pain and warmth on the site. For a couple of days. On Monday, the 15th, I had the worst flare-up of sciatica that I have ever had in my life. Left leg - it had a tremendous swelling. It was crippling. I am still using a pain. I cried because the pain was so horrific. I was able to get into the doctor early on Tuesday - prescribed Prednisone; hydrocodone; muscle relaxer. None of which touched the pain. I was unable to sleep for three days. I slept upright in a chair. I used an office chair as a wheel chair. I wasn&#39;t able to lay down. I&#39;ve improved but I still can&#39;t walk to the mailbox - could walk down there - two houses down but couldn&#39;t get back. I am using a cane still. I have to elevate leg on a recliner to sleep so it will help with the continued swelling. There was nothing I did that triggered it.

                                                About 4 and a half weeks after getting the J&amp;J vaccine, I began to experience marked symptoms: dizziness and disorientation,, balance problems, bilateral numbness in hands, feet and tip of tongue, awareness of left side of brain, intermittent mild nausea (likely related to dizziness).  These symptoms had a sudden onset. I am normally very healthy and active so these unusual symptoms without any illness were quite a departure from my normal health. They have, to date, persisted continually since onset over the past 3 weeks. They are very concerning. Last night I went to the ER to be seen since I could not get an appt. with a neurologist for several months and I am concerned about my sudden change in health status.

I slept 4 hours past my normal time for getting up. I had no balance and would stagger when standing. My entire body was in muscle and nerve pain. Even my skin hurt. I took 300 mg of Gabapentine which eased my pain. I continued to be off balance the remainder of the day, however, by the end of the day I was much better. I took several 1 hour naps throughout the day.

                                                On the way home I had neurological symptoms, tongue and lip tingling, nauseated. The smell of Lysol spray made me not be able to breath.  Made me dizzy and nauseous. It was like an LSD trip. It like being on a roller coaster, It continued all the way home. I could see all the timbers and bright green colors. Neck was stiff and it crawled up my head to my temples. It was like someone was holding my head. About 3 days later after vaccine my throat started to close and we headed to ER. I took turmeric and ginger to the ER as well as Benadryl.  The symptoms subsided before we reached ER so I didn&#39;t  seek care. I took vitamin E and fish oil  2X everyday after vaccine for 10 days following vaccine.

                                                Right away, they were watching me because I felt like my throat was tightening up a little bit. My blood pressure sky rocketed. Then I was okay after awhile. They pharmacist said to take some Benadryl when I got home if I needed it. He knew I had taken Claritin D earlier. I was okay though. But the next morning, I was so exhausted I could barely get out of bed. The next day, I was still really tired. On Sunday morning, 10th, it hit me - I woke up at 04:00 in am. Nauseous; light-headed; gastro-intestinal issues; extremely ill. I called my brother in and was afraid to be by myself. I could barely move around to even get water or go to bathroom.  I got through it somehow that day and on Monday I was just maybe a little but that isn&#39;t saying much - still severe. By Tuesday, I called the pharmacy - I was so light-headed I thought I was going to pass out and they told me to go to ER and someone took me and doctor said he was seeing a lot of this.  Gave me IV fluids. It was difficult to stay hydrated - they gave me paperwork on what to drink to stay hydrated - Pedialyte - anything that had water in it. I drank Essentia Water, too. I couldn&#39;t stay hydrated and I was so light-headed  (kept feeling like I was going to pass out) that I could have gone to ER again two days later. Doctor said take it easy - he said my body was busy making antibodies. That light-headedness for about a week - but I couldn&#39;t drive for two weeks because of it - was still so dehydrated. I had a strange sensation - like I was outside my body - I couldn&#39;t think straight. I was feeling pain in my back by my kidneys and went to my doctor.

Later at night I had a low grade fever with achiness and headache. The flu like symptoms resolved by morning but I continue to have vertigo and intermittent nausea and my BP was still high in the morning around 9 am but came down by 12:45 to my normal range.  Paramedics at the site did a BP, pulse ox, blood sugar, ECG . Everything was normal except my BP which was 180/90.  This morning it was 167/98 and 168/97.  No treatment.  Saw my doctor&#39;s partner at 1:00 today and BP was back to my normal range but I still have mild vertigo and intermittent nausea.  Doc gave me some exercises to do for the vertigo and did not seem to think that it was related to the shot, but since the paramedics said they had seen a LOT of the same reaction yesterday to the J&amp;J shot and two sites in other cities shut down for the same reactions, nobody will convince me that it was anything but the shot. I expected the flu like side effects but never dreamed it would cause my  BP to spike and the vertigo.

                                                The shot was painful but that wasn?t unexpected. I immediately felt woozy after the shot but thankfully I had brought a cold full sugar ginger ale and started drinking it. My sensation was kind of like a low blood sugar event where a soda can help. I was not surprised to feel this way and felt somewhat reluctant to report this as I didn?t really think it was unusual. and I didn?t report  it at the time. The shot was at a drive up event at a University.. After chugging the ginger ale I felt a bit better and was given the  ok to leave after 15 minutes. Back at work, I felt  better but still just a bit  ? off?.  But this passed in an hour and I was good the rest of the day. For a few days afterwards  I had a mild headache but no other real symptoms.  My usual  blood pressure under medications is 116/72.  It could be possible that the shot caused some lower blood pressure immediately or within the hour  after the shot?  Or perhaps the effect was low blood sugar for which the ginger ale helped.

We called the emergency services when they arrived she had collapsed. They broke the window and took her to the hospital, upon arrival we were informed that she has got a hemorrhage possible clotting due to high blood pressure. I now know the term is Cerebral Hemorrhage, she has been in ICU on a ventilation machine while they tried to drain the blood and clots. She&#39;s currently out of ICU however still complains about headache and back pain. We are informed that she has now developed some blood pressure and diabetes however it could be cleared in the short term. She&#39;s at the hospital and unknown how long she would have to stay there.

I can finally touch my arm now without feeling pain. The brain fog - it feels like - in the front of my forehead right above my eyebrows -  like there&#39;s something the size of orange that is just sitting there. It stops my thoughts and word processing. I was fine the day before the vaccine. That has not gone away. The doctor does not know what to do about the brain fog. I was having horrific full body muscle pain - especially in my legs. Like someone had put 20 lbs weight on each of my ankles. That is sort of resolved. But the fatigue - hasn&#39;t resolved. I always have a little bit of low level fatigue but this is worse - I have to have two naps a day now. Brain fog is the most troubling to me - hard to function - it&#39;s like instant Alzheimer&#39;s - my words are stuck in my mouth and I feel like I&#39;m trying to think through a veil or fog.

                                                On May 27th, I had an episode of double vision and light headedness and my blood pressure was up. Not quite confusion but just strange. They thought it might be a mini stroke - so I had an MRI or MRA - showed vascular changes but showed no acute stroke and carotids were okay. Also  did an EKG with some changes and a repeat  EKG - and that one seemed like a normal EKG.  I  had an echocardiogram - on Tuesday; Coronary CT on Wednesday and radiologist called my primary care doctor  and said there was a &#34;broken glass&#34; opaqueness (opacity) of left upper lobe. This Wednesday with the chest x-ray, I&#39;m concerned - I have been short of breath and tired lately - just not feeling good. On May 28th,  I started Lisinopril for blood pressure and also started aspirin.  My blood pressure is still fluctuating.  I&#39;m waiting for a lung CT to be scheduled - Pulmonary function study to be schedule and that&#39;s a couple of weeks out.  I haven&#39;t had another episode of double vision.  Fatigue and short of breath and I have had some diarrhea. I had had some weird GI stuff all winter long but it restarted (diarrhea) 2 weeks ago. I hadn&#39;t had it for four months or so.

                                                The signs started with light headiness, fatigue, unbalanced after walking a block. Felt like I was going to pass out. Next it was headaches and they got worst and felt like some one was pounding something in my head. Ear pressure with headaches and the next to unbearable is the feeling like my body is moving and I am not moving.  A wave  sensation that comes and goes almost like I am not in control of what&#39;s going on in my brain.  My blood pressure started to dropped for a week down to 105/68 daily. I went to emergency room because of pain in left arm. At times I feel things in my brain like moving around. I don&#39;t know how to explain it but it&#39;s scary. I have been to a previous Dr for help but lots of test no results.  I am not seeing Dr, had a balanced test done it came back very good. I will see a Neurologist on 7/13 to see if she can help. Please help me!!

                                                Instant headache and pain shooting down arm and side while being injected, sick feeling and light headed right as I was leaving the facility.  Within 4 hours I was struggling to do anything.  I was tired and felt and nauseated, light headed and felt like i was hit by a truck.  The bottoms of my feet hurt and I had stabbing pains so bad in my knee joints I could barely walk without assistance.  I felt very ill for about a week after the shot but the headaches continued constantly for over a month but aren&#39;t daily anymore even though I still have them, and the fatigue was getting worse and still is a problem to this day. Once I was feeling a bit better my right knee started to give out and my left knee was cracking. Since I got that vaccine on 3/6/21 I have had back to back problems.  Below is a quick list of these things that have occurred by dates: 3/30/21 - Constant headaches since the vaccine and ear pain and throat issues.  4/16/21 - Right knee giving out on me that started shortly after vaccine and gotten worse.  X-ray and physical therapy ordered.  4/22/21 - Shortness of breath, back pain, constant fatigue.  Blood work that showed elevated D-dimer then chest x-ray and ct-scan ordered. 4/26/21 - Ultrasound for nodule found on ct-scan. 5/4/21 - Biopsy done of mediastinal mass. 5/11/21 - Physical done for surgery. 5/24/21 - Surgery to remove mediastinal mass, right side of thyroid, two parathyroids and lymph nodes. 6/1/21 - Follow-up for surgery.  When I asked why this happened, the doctor said we may never know but the biopsy of the right thyroid nodule result showed thyroiditis, Autoimmune/Hashimoto&#39;s, and  that my immune system attacked my thyroid.  The doctor said she tested me for that in 9/20 and it was negative. 6/2/21 - Left knee pain.  About 4 days after my surgery on 5/24 i turned towards the door and heard a loud pop in my left knee.  It had been crackling since the vaccine but wasn&#39;t giving out like the right one. I couldn&#39;t walk on it at all and was using crutches.   6/9/21 - Mri on left knee showed medial and lateral meniscus tears.  Referred to Ortho Dr. 6/28/21 - Test thyroid levels post op.  TSH levels high.  Referral to Endocrinologist. 6/30/21 - Left knee treatment, cortisone shot in knee for now to help with pain and inflammation so I can function and physical therapy.  Since then my 4th toe on my right foot has been numb for almost two weeks.  I am scheduled for numerous future physical therapy appointments and doctors appointments.    Then to make matters worse I just heard 2 days ago that J&amp;J is having more issues and mentioned autoimmune and wondered could that be what caused all of this?   I regret getting that stupid J&amp;J vaccine.  I expected it to he the Pfizer because that is what was there 2 days before I got my shot.  I told the person I didn&#39;t want it and she got someone in charge to talk me into it.  I should have walked out of there and I am mad at myself for caving to this woman.  If J&amp;J says we need a booster I will refuse to take it.  I don&#39;t know if the vaccine was what triggered all of this but I find it quite odd that all of this started almost immediately after I got that vaccine.  Not only to me but also to my sister who got it at the same time.  She fell within 30 minutes of getting that vaccine and 3 more times that day, and has had and is still having numerous problems that mimic mine, such as issues with her feet and legs.  She struggles to walk and is having issues with her thyroid among other things that she wasn&#39;t having a problem with prior to the vaccine. This is just the short version of all I have been through.  Any questions feel free to contact me.

                                                I woke up on 3/16/21 feeling my heart beating rapidly. I was slight dizzy upon standing from bed. I took my blood pressure at 6:06 -- readings were 112/84 and 120BPM. My usual BPM is between 60 and 75.   I meditated and took my readings again at 7:44 a.m.. They were 105/78 and 95 BPM. I verified this on an oximeter.

                                                15-20 minutes after the injection, I started feeling a tightness in back of my throat; I broke out in cold sweat. I started getting dizzy and very whoozy. I felt my vision starting to close in. I thought I was going to pass out. I got the attention of the person across me to get an attendant and they brought me a chair with wheels. Two people got me up (and I&#39;m not a big person) - they were worried I was going down and I was taken to exam room. They said I was white as a sheet. She checked my eyes and throat a few times and checked my blood pressure. It was lower than normal but she didn&#39;t seem really concerned about it - 104 over 60 something which is low for me. She gave me water to sip. She gave me very cold compresses to put on my forehead. They watched me pretty good. She had the epi-pen ready. She watched me and I sat in there and nurse came in a quite a few times to check me for about an hour. About an hour later the tightness went away and I started feeling myself again. We went home. I went to sleep. I woke up at night to go to bathroom and I was still a little woozy but I didn&#39;t fall. Next day, I just didn&#39;t feel well. My left arm was starting to hurt - was no swelling; it was a little red at injection site. It hurt just a little. I was woozy. My eyes couldn&#39;t focus as well. I felt out of it. I drank a lot of water and took a nap.  Yesterday, I felt pretty decent but still woozy somewhat. I tried to run errands with my husband  - just wasn&#39;t quite right. Today, much better but I&#39;m not quite myself yet. Just a little wooziness - weird feeling. Yesterday, I did feel a soreness in the back of my right calf muscle. It wasn&#39;t warm to the touch or swollen. I don&#39;t have it anymore, it went away.  It could have been a muscle thing from the first day of the vaccine when I got home and I got up and almost fell down. I do still have some achiness in joints. Especially in my knees - which isn&#39;t normal because they are replaced.

My heart rate stayed at 109 or more until 10 PM the next night when its slowly went down to a normal heart rate.  At 3 am  (12 hours after the shot) i had  a blinding debilitating headache that lasted until 9pm the next night.   It also affected my vision.   The headache was so bad i could not concentrate on the simplest task.  I  was unsure of what i could take for the headache.   So, I did not take anything.    When i woke up i was very tired and this lasted until the following day.  6am i had a fever of 102.3 this went down to 100.4 at 9:15 pm that night.  I also had chills for several hours. 9:20 AM  the nausea started followed by vomiting and dizziness.   This only lasted for a few hours.    I  experienced very vivid dreams the night of the shot.    I only drank some coconut water all day and could not eat any food.  The next day Saturday March 27 i felt better but the fatigue did not go away until late in the evening.   Sleeping seemed to help but i could only sleep for 2- 3 hours at the most.

                                                Dizziness, light-headed, nausea, sweating, pale skin.  The patient was observed and given water and orange juice for 25-30 minutes. She felt well enough to leave the pharmacy on her own after 25-30 minutes.  The  patient had a prior history of anxiety prior to receiving vaccinations and was very nervous about getting the vaccination prior to administration.  The patients daughter was with her and felt that her symptoms were due to anxiety about  getting vaccinated, but later called the pharmacy asking to report the adverse events as being related to receiving the vaccine.  It is not known weather or not the symptoms are directly related to the vaccine.

My eyes swelled and they started to tear up, I felt weak all day and into the evening. I never had a bad reaction to a vaccine before, so this was surprising.  I contacted the health department as they came to my house and gave me the shot, but I could not get through to anyone. I had to leave a message. After I was contacted back, I was told that someone would contact me that very same day, but no one ever did that day or any other day. .Because of that, I thought it must not have been a big deal, but after reading today that people in a specific had some of the same reactions I did, I thought I should report it.

I ended up falling when I tried to reach my walker. I am normally a little unstable, but I was unprepared to be so unsteady and I wish I was warned that this might happen. I was still a little dizzy the next day with some flu like symptoms. The Vertigo has happened again since then more than usual, but it is not as bad.

                                                From the April 4, 5, 6 I felt very dizzy and out of it. When I got home on the 4th of April I had a metallic taste in my mouth and I started to feel pain in my chest. On my right side, center of my chest and the left side of my chest is where I felt pain. It was the worst pain I felt in my life, I took Tylenol. I called my doctor the next day 4/5/21 and she told me take off for 2 days per protocol for J&amp;J vaccines.  I did have a fever on 4/5/21On the 7th of April I had to stop working because my headaches were so bad. The doctor ordered new nebulizer kits for me, I was just using those. My doctor told me not take anything else except for Tylenol. I was having trouble breathing so I went to ER on the 20th of April, they ran tests (xray, blood). Since the ER visit, I have not been able to work full time. I have been feeling very unwell, breathing issues and a bad cough. I have been sick again since 6/2/21,  I was given antibiotics and I have also been prescribed prednisone. The prednisone has made a huge difference, I was able to start working more. Once off the prednisone, I started to feel bad again. Since getting my COVID 19 vaccine, I have not been able to work a full work week.

She stated having severe pain in her arm at the injection site. I asked questions to determine the type of pain and when it occurred. She stated it started a week or two after the injection, there was localized swelling, tenderness, and difficulty with mobility. As I asked more questions she also mentioned swelling in her knee and leg and that she had gone to her orthopedic doctor to be checked out and they couldnt determine the cause. They asked if she wanted a scan done because she was concerned about a clot she declined. I asked if she told the provider she had recently recieved the J&amp;J COVID-19 vaccine she said no. I suggested she return to the doctors office and let them know that as they may be more apt to do more thorough testing and examination to rule out possible clots.

The stiffness was intense, uncomfortable and bothersome enough for me to take Tylenol for the pain the next 5 days and it lasted for about a week.

                                                Johnson and Johnson Janssen COVID-19 EUA vaccine  At the time of the injection, the vaccine burned as it entered my arm. (I have never felt that burning sensation with any other vaccination that I have had in the past. Twenty minutes after the vaccination, I became lightheaded and dizzy.  I could walk but I was wobbly. At one hour after the vaccination, I felt a sharp stabbing pain in the left side of my tongue and then the left side and only the left side of my tongue began to go numb. Within a couple of minutes, I realized that my left jaw was going numb, too.  The numbness slowly but surely began to move up the left side of my face all the way to the top of my head.  I had a sharp but brief headache on the left side of my head  that subsided quickly but the numbness remained.  I went home and talked to two people on the phone for several hours because they wanted to be sure that I was OK. At two hours after the vaccination, my face was still numb but I could think and talk clearly, but I was clearing my throat and coughing a lot.  At that point, I also realized that my whole left arm was a little numb and my fingers on my left hand were tingling.  That numbness lasted about 20 minutes and then subsided. The facial numbness lasted for hours.  I wasn&#39;t scared and I wasn&#39;t in pain but it was very strange.  It felt a little bit like the after affects of dental anesthesia but it wasn&#39;t just in my mouth it was the whole left side of my face.   I believe that this must have been an allergic reaction to one of the chemicals in the vaccine but I don&#39;t know which one.  If you can tell me which chemical it might have been, I will avoid it in the future.

Only a few moments after, pt started to experience 8-10 minutes of nausea and light-headedness. RPH came over to provide care, asked more about past experiences - pt admitted that a long time ago she experienced nervousness and has had this feeling before. She states she has not had such a reaction since she was a child and was also embarrassed for the incident occurring in front of others.

Symptoms seemed to subside on about 5/21, perhaps helped by her avoidance of caffeine and alcohol.  There was a brief flare up the week of 5/19 after a meal of spicy food.  That same week she notice some shuffling of the left foot and apparent left leg weakness, without injury.

                                                2 different events: 1) 20-30 minutes after the shot, I felt dizzy and disoriented, similar to car-sickness, but I wasn&#39;t in a moving vehicle; It appeared that the center of the field of vision for my left eye had become blurred. Subsequently, I had a bad headache and body aches, which lasted most of that day and the next day. My vision is still blurred. A visit to my optician on 13 April 2021 confirmed an epi-retinal membrane, which was not present at my previous eye exam.  2) about two weeks after the shot, I experienced severe pain and raised blood vessels in different areas of both my fore arms, hands and fingers, and my lower left leg and left foot. These lasted a few minutes and then subsided. They were severe enough to wake me up multiple times every night. I finally went to my doctor&#39;s office on April 26, saw the nurse practitioner who actually watched one of these episodes. She consulted Dr., they were only concerned about my left leg being a potential blood clot; said the other areas were unlikely to cause significant problems, sent me for an ultrasound examination of my left leg on April 27th, which showed no blood clot. The intermittent raised veins and pain continued for another week or so then subsided.

At the same time, my fever shot up to 101.8, and mucus began running from my nose like never before.  Shaking subsided after an hour or so, fever broke during the night, and cold symptoms lasted about 3 days.

Which is also unusual as I am a gardener and wear one all summer. More than usual fatigue, still happening. Dry heaves and felt  like I had a hang over for two days too! I have never had a problem with my gall bladder or liver which I know are on the right had side also.

Approximately 10 minutes after injection, I began to sweat profusely, followed by intensifying extreme lightheadedness. I could not stand, or lift my head, as I would have definitely passed out.  My shoulders and neck became extremely painful, as if ?frozen?, also preventing me from lifting my head.  After about 35 minutes I very gradually began to recover. It was about an hour before I began to move around normally.   Pharmacy and store staff  debated calling the paramedics, but I refused.  FYI, I had not been especially anxious about the vaccine, and I have never experienced such a reaction to anything in my life. It was a traumatic experience I would not wish to repeat.

On 04/06 She passed out while sitting in her chair, woke up and began throwing up. Had extreme short term memory loss and low blood pressure. On 04/08 while at her primary care Dr, he suggested a hospital visit with suspicion of possible stroke.  Was admitted  and released the following day. Dr advised possible mini strokes but could also be dehydration.  CBC with differential showed other results than dehydration.   Starting around 04/20 she started having chest pains and thought it was heart burn, after medication and another visit to her pcp she was admitted to the hospital again on 04/23.  Her troponin levels indicated a possible heart attack.  She had a heart catherization and was found to have a healthy heart.  Again, her blood pressure has been decreased since, her hgb and hct has also been low with a history of it being high.  A high WBC since all of this has started among other unexplained blood results.

She had significant weakness in the lower extremities and mild weakness in the upper extremities.  She also had a dysarthric speech.   Given the patient&#39;s CSF analysis showing protein elevation to 266 with no pleocytosis, wbc&#39;s were only for, there was support for a clinical diagnosis of acute inflammatory demyelinating poly radicular neuropathy or such variant.

                                                I got my vaccine twelve weeks ago and I still have problems with my left arm. I have lost a lot of the range of motion and I get shooting pains when I try to do regular activities. At first I noticed pain when I reached back. It will not work if I try to reach for something and I get a shooting pain. I have tried taking Ibuprofen and icing it and it did not help. I also tried massage which helps a little for a short period of time.

                                                A day after the vaccination, I experience loud ringing in my ears. I have not had this condition before. I could also hear a pulse in my ears. The tinnitus has still not resolved 10 weeks after the vaccine. Also, I was lightheaded and dizzy and that has only subsided somewhat. 3 days after the vaccine, I had  very strong  veryeffects when I took Snythroid, my thyroid medication which I have taken for many years. This issue has persisted even though we have lowered my dose. This was not an issue prior to the vaccine.

Body aches and stiffness, affected my walking.  Did not take temperature at that time.  Got back into bed with 2 blankets and a comforter and still couldn&#39;t sleep.  Got up a 7AM - temp 102.2, shaking less but still  feeling cold, body was hot to touch.  I had a bad headache and body aches and stiffness were still there. I noticed at that time  that I had a bright red flush on both cheeks and my nose that was hot to the touch.  Took 600mg of Ibuprofen.  Went back to bed feeling terrible.  At 12 noon I got back up and temp was down to 99.7.  Headache, body aches, stiffness, and &#34;red flush&#34; still on cheeks and nose.  Went back to bed.  Took more Ibuprofen at 7pm - temp was down to 98.7.  Headache was better, body aches improved.  Flushed hot face was still present.  Went to  sleep at 11:30PM  and slept for 10 hours.  Today, 03/06/21, all symptoms improved, no fever, redness of face is still present but less.

                                                about two hours after injection,  I experienced headache,  then mild dizziness,  then extreme dizziness,  then sudden overwhelming fatigue,  then swollen eyes and eyelids,  then chills and elevated heart rate,  with pounding.    I had to cancel the class I was supposed to teach,  because I would not have been safe to drive to campus.  I slept from approximately 2:30 pm on March 8 until 8:30 am today,  March 9,   all symptoms continuing,  with bathroom breaks, a couple of short reports to family members who were watching out for me,  and one  2-hour window during which I ate a small meal,  went back to bed,  and read part of a book.    During bathroom breaks I took more antronex,  some milk thistle,  and some glutathione,  which seemed to at least temporarily reduce dizziness and eye/eyelid swelling.  At one point I took some hawthorne tincture because I was concerned about the heart pounding.    Today I woke up feeling symptom-free,  but by 2 pm I was compelled by sudden fatigue to take a two-hour nap.   After that I felt better,  and I think I am now fine,  at 7:45 pm on 3/9/21.    I am happy to have gotten the Janssen vaccine,  because it is one and done!

                                                I had ligament repair surgery on my right ankle on 01/06/2021.  My recovery was going well.  I was walking well without pain and was gaining balance and strength with physical therapy.  I had almost no discomfort at the site of my surgery.  Three days after having my J&amp;J vaccination I woke up to a lot of discomfort in my right ankle, making it difficult for me to walk as I had been able to walk.  I have struggled over the last six days to get back to the mobility I had prior to getting my J&amp;J vaccination.  I spoke with representative from my orthopedic surgeon?s office this morning who confirmed that I am most likely suffering from the side effects of the J&amp;J vaccination, and she suggested that my lack of normal mobility will most likely last another week.

                                                Noon the day after the vaccine I was suddenly overcome with nausea, and dizziness that sent me stumbling to bed and vomiting into a bucket next to me. Vomiting lasted for one session, but dizziness and nausea stayed for about 3 hours, and then nausea, fatigue and general sick feeling kept me in bed until the next day. April 9 I woke up still feeling out of sorts, but not as bad. Note: 28 minutes after having the vaccine, once I started driving home, the vision in my left eye suddenly went blurry, and I nearly lost vision in that eye. I tried to find a safe place to pull over but couldn&#39;t. After 5-8 minutes the vision came back but stayed a bit blurry for a couple hours. Never had any such thing happen before.

I could not go up and down steps as my legs would not hold me. Headache.  Week 2 to present. Fatigue, I have to nap every day and I sleep 8 hours or more at night.  Diarrhea, despite taking OTC medications  to control. Dehydration and dizziness. I am now 4 weeks since my shot on March 4th and I continue to have these symptoms.   I went to see my doctor and all lab tests are normal. There is no other diagnose reason for my continued symptoms. I wish I waited to get either the Pfizer shot or Moderna as I have not heard of these extreme and prolonged side effects from those shots.

I woke up (Wed.) with  NAUSEA and took the &#34;anti-nausea&#34; pills that I had left over from when I had COVID (11 - 2020).  My upper arm was now very sore, especially when I tried to lift it.  I took my temp. and I had a FEVER (101). On Thurs., my temp. went down to 99.5 and the nausea was gone.  Today (Fri.), I woke up with pain on my shoulder (over the injection site). I took Advil and iced it and it is now much better (this eve.). The only side effect I have now is the pain in my arm (mostly when I lift it). I am eating better and sleeping better now.

                                                Patient exhibited stress and anxiety about receiving vaccination.  After administration, she said that the site hurt more than expected and said she was feeling dizzy.  Cold wet paper towels were offered to her to place on her face.  Next, reported feeling strange, shaky.  Leaned forward with head low.  Instant cold pack was placed on back of neck.   Over next five to ten minutes patient&#39;s anxiety increased, as did shakiness.  Blood pressure readings were taken and elevated, as was heartrate, but not at hypertensive crisis.  Patient could breathe and speak.  She contacted someone to assist her with leaving, but when the ETA seemed too long, she agreed to have us contact EMS.  Her condition seemed to improve and decline several times before assistance arrived.  She expressed concern about the elevated BP readings.  A second cool pack was administered until she next reported feeling cold and chilly, with shakiness.  She mentioned that her abdomen also felt cold, which was strange.  EMS arrived and transported patient approximately 30 minutes post administration.

The patient&#39;s arm was hard as a marble, redness was still as big as a baseball and she could not touch her arm. On 20-APR-2021, the patient had bladder infection/abdominal pain to groin and had infection from lady&#39;s problem and further stated it as bladder infection.

Medicated with Tylenol, bananas, oatmeal and herbal tea.  Documented on pdf form, but unable to use &#34;continuation page&#34;, so added sheet that unable to attach.  Will try again to upload and send separately to this.  NO forms given to me at pharmacy for reporting anything.  I called several times and left messages, but no return call.  Sent email, but response saying unable to help at this time.  Very frustrating as I continued having severe symptoms and unable to get help.  Finally feeling better enough today to send form.

                                                Around 5:30 pm on Friday night, I started feeling really cold; couldn&#39;t get warm for 2 hours. Then I started getting a fast heart rate; checked this around 7 pm; BP was 181/80 and heart rate was 135.  I was starting to feel warm along with being cold.  I had a gradually increasing temperature; checked it around 8:30 pm; was 102.1; took 2 tylenol and temperature slowly started going down.  My heart would not slow down; I sat in my recliner and kept deep breathing and had calming herbal tea; was afraid to go to the ER due to Covid.  After more than 4 hours with a racing heart, I felt exhausted and laid down around 12:30 a.m. and fell asleep.  I woke around 3 am with nausea and soaking wet pajamas from sweating.  I fell asleep again and woke around 7 am; I felt very tired, woozy and my heart hurt.  I felt a bit more normal after a few days.  I still feel a bit dizzy and light headed.  I was concerned when I later heard some J&amp;J vaccines were contaminated; on 4/2/21, I called the pharmacy because the number they wrote on my card, 1805D18 wasn&#39;t clear; they told me this # was incorrect and should be 037A21B and couldn&#39;t explain why this was so. They were going to check into  this and call me; I called them again on 4/5/21 and was told the correct # was 043A21A and that the vaccine was from the Netherlands.  They couldn&#39;t offer any more information or explain why the initial # was incorrect. I find this concerning and have been unable to find an answer.

Initial information was processed along with additional information received on 04-JUL-2021, 08-JUL-2021 and 09-JUL-2021. The patient&#39;s weight was 64.86 kilograms, and height was 165 centimeters. No past medical history or concurrent conditions were reported. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1802072 and expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total administered to upper left arm on 11-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported. On 16-MAR-2021, (5 days after vaccination) the patient had a strong reaction to the vaccine and experienced headaches, dizziness, nausea, and weakness which persisted for several weeks. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced high blood pressure and started using losartan, and metoprolol from 30-MAR-2021 as treatment. On 22-JUN-2021, the patient&#39;s physician got tested her for the spike protein immunoglobulin G (IgG Antibody) test and its results came negative (confirmed immunological vaccine failure). The patient wanted to know whether it was okay to get another vaccine as a booster dose to boost her immunity because she felt if she did not do that, she would be at risk of catching a virus. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from dizziness, headaches, nausea, and weakness, had not recovered from blood pressure high, and the outcome of confirmed immunological vaccine failure was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition). This report was associated with a product quality complaint: 90000185416. The suspected product quality complaint has been confirmed to be not voided (meet pqc criteria) based on the PQC evaluation/investigation performed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0 - 20210710887-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S -Confirmed Immunological Failure.

At the same time it felt like my head (in notch immediately forward of middle of ear to ear)  was in a tightening vise.  Then I got hot and cold  but not severely.  Same for dizziness, very mild. I was nasusseous and not able to eat.  I had random muscles pains , none lasting more than a few minutes in any one place. Odd thing was that I felt no discomfort at sight of injection. Next day I felt just as bad but at 8:30pm I felt like throwing up (after having 2 teaspons of vegetarian vegetable soup). However, I only had dry heaves. I live by myself and started to get scared. I called my daughter and took a Tylenol at 9pm. Within 10 minutes the feeling of a vise and my aching teeth felt significantly better. but  stil very fatigued. Next day, today,  I feel much better but still a little foggy headed. I can eat. I can function normally, thank heavens. If I had to take another shot now, I wouldn&#39;t. Not even sure I&#39;ll take a booster when it comes out . It was very scarey.

                                                Patient got the Jansen covid 19 vaccine today.  She waited 30 minutes (since she stated she got a rash as a kid from a vaccine and hadn&#39;t received a vaccine since then).  She was fine after 30 minutes and handed us the timer and walked away.  She came back and said she thought she is just hungry since she hadn&#39;t eaten and felt funny.  She said she was going to get some food.  We had associate walk her over.  They came back.  She sat down and ate her food.  We checked on her but now she stated she had vertigo and needed meclizine and thought she&#39;d be ok if she went home and laid down. I offered her ice for her neck or head and she refused.  I also offered to lay her on the floor and elevate her feet, but she refused.  She said her neck gives her problems so didn&#39;t want ice or to lower her neck. She was sitting this whole time and said she felt in slow motion.  She said she wanted to go to the restroom but I didn&#39;t want her going alone. She called her son in law that was shopping in the store and we asked him to come over.  He was going to drive her home but she said no one was home.  I asked if they&#39;d like an ambulance and they both said yes.  We called 911 and stayed with the patient until EMS arrived.  She was feeling somewhat better but they took her to get checked out to be safe.

I regained consciousness after _about 10 seconds, was helped up another flight of stairs by a friend and neighbor where I - again -  blacked out falling to the hallway floor.  I regained consciousness in another 10 seconds.

Steroids helped quite a bit, but not totally. The day after the last steroid pill, all the aches, pains, everything came back.

                                                For 2 nights following the immunization, starting the night of the shot, bleeding from the injection site occurred, overnight. In the morning, her entire arm was covered in blood and her sheets wet. Her husband cleaned her up, and the next day, she did not have any bleeding.  But then the second night, again overnight, she bled heavily and woke up with her arm covered in blood and sheets wet with blood.  She also experienced leg pain so bad that she couldn&#39;t walk.  This happened after she had done some leg exercises in which she used a tension band.

                                                Sore arm right away and then went to a sore muscle like normal the next day and was sore for three days. What happened next, I had gone to ENT for my ear (5th) and he put me on heavy dose of Prednisone (6th). Following Tuesday, I was on Prednisone for ear. I was already really achy by then. On the third day after the Prednisone I fatigue, headaches and neck pain but I didn&#39;t have any other pain. I still couldn&#39;t hear though.  I was on this for almost 4 weeks and from them I started like I was having a hot flash and then I would get cold; sore throat; headaches heavy bones and achy muscles; earaches; fatigue; dizziness like you wouldn&#39;t believe. They were cyclical - I&#39;d have them for a couple days and then for about a half a day I&#39;d be a bit better and then it would start up again. The fatigues and dizziness didn&#39;t change when the other symptoms seemed to be a bit better. My hearing didn&#39;t start to clear until I went to see the 2nd ENT which was a couple of weeks down the road. I do not have the stamina I had before the vaccine - I&#39;m not sleeping well at night and I&#39;m always short of breath at any exertion. It is improving but it&#39;s slow. Again, the symptoms I experienced during cyclical times: Cold symptoms, runny nose, sore mouth, ringing in my ears was horrible; dizziness and short of breath - cyclical for three weeks. The Prednisone took away all my cramps and pain in my joints that I had before the vaccine. Currently: My heart feels like it&#39;s going 100 miles an hour at night in bed - chest discomfort at night. Legs blue in the shower. The week of the 28th, I was done with the Prednisone and then all the pain came back and more. I can&#39;t take an inflammatory - the pain is still there and my usual cramps came back.

I went to the Emergency Room on March 15 and told them I was having a reaction to the vaccine.  I waited for over an hour and no one helped me but they helped everyone else who came after me, and with Covid so I left. I called Dr and went to his office that day.  I had a hyperbaric oxygen chamber treatment and he put me on glutathione, multiple vitamin, zinc, Vitamin C, minerals.  I continued  seeing Dr and continued with the oxygen chamber treatments until I left New York to return home to Cape May, NJ. on May 3. I then rented a Hyperbaric Oxygen Chamber on May 4 that I continue to use daily to this day, as I continue with fatigue, dizziness, lightheadedness , although it is lessening.

                                                When I woke the next morning I had a moderate headache, sore muscles all over which intensified throughout the day, intense pain in the spine between shoulder blades and when I tried to walk, my limbs would not do as I wanted.  They moved in wide circles- arms and legs.  This lasted through the day and next day it was sliightly better.  Balance was poor.  Had to hold onto things to walk.  Also I had fatigue.

My legs go out from under me. This just happens randomly. I can walk completely normal some days and some days it&#39;s not. The severest times is when it&#39;s hot outside. Today, I just about fell on my way into a building. I sat down for a few minutes and then it was okay. I have gout in my feet and in my knees but I have never had this weakness attributed with gout. I noticed that both arms - were like a flu-like ache from shoulders to the palms of my hands -that has happened just a couple of time. I see my doctor tomorrow. I go for blood tests and work up in the morning before seeing. him.

                                                No Immediate effect. Not sure if events are related ! On March 24th 2021, patient received the one Janssen # 1805022 Covid vaccine, at home, from a at Home doctor.  1) On May 12th 2021, patient, at home on the vent, began getting tired, she threw up, could barely walk and eventually became totally lethargic. Her oxygen was low and the on hand nurse used the Ambu bag to get her oxygen up to 100, while I called the ENT?s. The ENT?s checked her vitals, and did an EKG. We spoke to the doctor, and although by that time she was acting somewhat ?normal?, the decision was made to take her to hospital. Her oxygen was stabilized and her CO2 at the hospital was 80. She remained in the hospital for four days.  2) On Sunday, July 4th, patient was at home on the ventilator.   Approximately 1:30 pm she seemed to become somewhat tired and she dropped her coffee cup.A little later, while eating, she threw up, spilling food and drink on her top. She seemed more tired and needed help changing her top. She sat in her recliner for a while and then she had to go to the bathroom. I took her there in a wheelchair. By the time she was ready to leave the bathroom, she was comatose and I had to lift her, she was dead weight, and place her in the wheelchair.  I rolled her to the recliner and lifted her into it.  She was then completely unconscious, with a continuously running nose and bubbles and fluid coming from her mouth ! Note: This was exactly same experience we had with her on May  12th 2021, when she was taken to hospital.   I increased her breath rate on the Vent from 16 to 20, hoping that would expel CO2. I also increased the oxygen setting on the floor concentrator to 9, her pulse oxy was stable at 90. With the help of my daughter in law and grandson, we repositioned her on the recliner to a more comfortable and accessible position, connected the AMBU bag to the oxygen and slowly applied oxygen through her trach connection.  We had also called the emergency, requesting assistance. By slowly squeezing the AMBU bag, I got her oxygen up to 100 ! Note: This Is exactly what we did on May 12 th.  The ENT?s arrived shortly and within a few minutes after they arrived, patient started to come out of her comatose condition. The ENT?s checked her vitals,(somewhat normal) did an EKG, and checked her CO2 (45).We spoke to the doctor, and by that time she was acting ?normal? ! The decision was made to keep her at home instead of going to the hospital and an at-home X-ray was ordered in case she aspirated and conducted the following day. This x-ray Did Not show any aspiration !
