                                                Sensitivity started within four hours of dose. Autistic sensitivities to maximum. Scrambling of all senses including proprioception to the point of not being able to move from standing  or sitting. By hour seven, all sensory inputs were too overwhelming to do anything but shut down and sleep. 911 was not an option because they don&#39;t let you sleep, and ERs are overwhelming already, before maximizing all inputs. 7.5 mg hydrocodone for overwhelming pain and sensitivity, allowed sleep. On waking, sensitivity was lessened, but the pain started, 18 hours after the vaccination. Emotional lability for three days. Average aching of arm and injection site were not above expected levels. &#34;Brain fog&#34; and lack of ability to articulate (another autism symptom) started within that first seven hours, and diminished over next ten days. Not yet gone as of today  Dry mouth; overproduction of thick &#39;chunky&#39; mucus that wouldn&#39;t cough out, treated with guaifenesin, lasted three days. Shortness of breath and cough associated with that mucus also diminished after three days. Not completely gone ten days later.   Excessive thirst, onset two hours after vaccine, lasted two days.   Hyperalert (can&#39;t sleep without drugs), hyperactive despite weakness, and hypervigilant (extreme startle reflexes) lasted three days as well. Sleep was achieved with hydrocodone and THC.  All over body pain, feelings of immune mobilization (coming down with) for two days were not above expected levels.   No fainting or other collapse at time of injection, or later.  Knowing that severe over-stimulation is exacerbated in a medical setting, it was decided not to seek medical support for three days of systemic symptoms that would have easily merited hospitalization.

                                                Shot immediately started stinging.  My upper arm swelled with a hard ridge about 3 inches long and 1 inch wide.  Extremely painful.  Could barely raise my arm and could not sleep on that side or tolerate even soft touch of my entire upper arm.  No other reaction that seemed like an allergic response.  I did get very sick for 2 days with severe flu symptoms and strange shooting pains in random parts of my body.  Enough pain to wake me from a sound sleep.  Bad chills, but no fever. I did. I give my legs seemed swollen for about 3 days.   I got the J&amp;J vaccine on 3-6-21 and my arm is still swollen with a slightly smaller hard and painful ridge at the injection site and it sometimes throbs and itches severely.  Today is 4-2-21.  Starting to wonder if it will ever go away.  I still cannot sleep on that side.  The pain overall is less, but it still throbs and itches periodically throughout the day.

I checked her blood pressure, which registered as 80/60.  I offered to call 911, due to hypotension, but when I checked it on her other arm, it was 177/87, which she confirmed was closer to her baseline.  Additionally, she complained of nausea and vomited.  I then offered to call 911 again, but she said that she was feeling better.  I continued to monitor her, and offered to call an ambulance again,  She did not complain of any difficulty breathing or chest tightness/pain. I continued to monitor her for twenty minutes, and then she said that she wanted to go home.  I offered to call an ambulance again, but she assured me that she felt better and wanted to go home.

                                                Chills and low grade fever, then within another hour felt light-headed and my body hurt all over - skin was sensitive to even my clothes.  Headache started in the front of my forehead by late evening, and I literally couldn&#39;t even walk up to my bed.  Restless sleeping with all the sweating and chills.  Woke up with headache remaining and feeling very &#34;wiped out&#34; and still light-headed.  No more chills or sweats the next day, but I was weak for about 48 hours.  Honestly - I&#39;m very healthy and getting Covid directly from another person couldn&#39;t have been worse than getting  the vaccine.  :(   And I am even saying that as a 35 year professional Research Scientist.

                                                I got an itchy rash on my right leg within the first 15 minutes, staff at the site tried to get me to belief it was from anxiety. The redness subsided though bumps remained when they let me go home. I also felt a bit &#34;detached&#34; on the drive home and really had to concentrate on my driving. Once home, I still felt odd but went about my day. About four hours later, I realized I was scratching my stomach and chest while watching TV. Upon raising my shirt, I saw a bright red rash on the top part of my belly that extended underneath both breasts and to the area directly over my heart, and up my left side into my left armpit. All of these areas were very itchy. I put Hydrocortisone cream on them, which helped reduce the itching quite quickly. I then took half a Benadryl tablet. When I awoke the next morning, the areas that had been bright red now had dark red dots but did not itch. However, I had lines of a bright red, itchy rash on both thighs near my groin. I again applied Hydrocortisone cream and took Benadryl, which helped abate the symptoms. Lymph nodes in my left armpit were quite sore as well, so I took ibuprofen.

I had periods of nausea and dizzy spells for the following week. I had an extreme migrane the night of the shot and chills throughout the next week. I did not report the symptoms to  anyone because I had not heard that these were reactions to this vaccine. After I heard that others were experiencing similar symptoms, I felt I should report my experience.

                                                Developed heart palpitations approximately 10 hours after receiving vaccine. Also insomnia  making it impossible to sleep.  Palpitations seemed to get better by 11 am the next morning but my heart rate was still elevated ( pulse 106-112).  Shortly after that ( around 11:45 am) I became extremely light headed and dizzy and felt like I was going to pass out. I also started to feel nauseous and sweaty.   I rested lying down for two hours before hearing back from my doctor&#39;s office.  I was able to control the lightheadedness and dizziness by lying down. The feeling of passing out / nearly fainting went away.  I continued to feel nauseous and my  heartrate was still elected. I started to get a headache as well.  On the advise of a nurse at my doctor&#39;s office,  my husband took me to the ER.  My EKG was normal . My heartrate was elevated.  Due to the overcrowding at the ER that day I was made to wait at least an hour and half for further evaluation.  I continued to feel light headed and slightly dizzy. My nausea and headache got much worse .  I was finally taken back to a treatment room and received IV fluids, Zofran and Tylenol.  My heartrate went back to normal and my headache and nausea improved with treatment and I was discharged around 7pm.  I continued to feel very tired and slightly lightheaded that evening. The next morning  I was much more nauseous again and still very weak feeling and slightly lightheaded. I have  continued to feel weak, very fatigued , unwell and nauseous on and off until today, April 14, which is 6 days after I was vaccinated.

Six days after the vaccine, I actually went to bed with severe cold chills which lasted several hours.  I am still experiencing intermittent periods of &#34;brain fog&#34; or at times feeling a little light headed.  Last Saturday was the only day that I haven&#39;t experienced feeling this way.  Again, it does not happen all of the time but it is bothersome. I am hopeful that after this Thursday (2 weeks will have passed since the vaccine) that symptoms will disappear. If not, I will follow up with my family practitioner.  Thank you!&#34;

My life partner started calling my name and check my pulse (which he said was strong) ; then I came to but was really dizzy; I was nauseous and vomited for a few minutes; extremely hot/sweating; and after I stopped vomiting, then had a bowel movement (He had to aid me in getting to the bathroom).   About 20 - 25 minutes later I felt much better; everything calmed down.  I was ultimately able to fall back to sleep.

Took Tylenol and started feeling better after about 2-1/2 hours.  The next morning, the 25th, felt like I had a mild case of the flu but, again, Tylenol seemed to help.  No soreness in arm or other symptoms.

I went to the ER and they gave me fluids. I was told it was a reaction to the vaccine, but my paperwork said upper respiratory infection. My cough started out dry, I had SOB, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea and joint pain. My PCP put me on a steroid and an antibiotic Keflex (500mg, 3 times a day). I get lightheaded just walking around the house. I&#39;m still experiencing SOB, fatigue and the cough. Today is the first day that I could get up an move around. I&#39;m fine when I first wake up, but I eventually feel depleted.

                                                At 4 AM the following day I woke up with a severe headache and fever. I attempted to take 2 extra strength Tylenol which seemed to trigger cyclic  vomiting every 15-20 minutes for approximately 4 hours. After this, I vomited  once an hour for another 4 hours. I was finally able to sip water and sleep after this. I also took my first temperature once feeling better and it was 99.9F. My normal temp is in the 97s and I?m sure it was much higher during the vomiting.  My fever broke approximately 12 hours after the first symptoms. Headache lasted approximately 36 hours and resolved the next day, although a milder one did come back off and on for a couple more days.  I did not have much pain in the arm I received the injection in.

                                                Beginning approximately 10 PM (about 8 hours post-injection), I started to have chills (feet were freezing) and was exhausted. Went to bed, and slept most of the night, only waking once to urinate and to drink a small amount (approx 2 oz) of Coca Cola -- I was very nauseous and thought it would help settle my stomach. During the night I sweated profusely. At 8 AM,  I woke again and went to urinate. At that time I felt very nauseous, dizzy, and light headed. When I walked about 2 -3 feet to my bedroom, I collapsed on the floor - unconscious. My partner called EMS, they arrived minutes later. By then I was conscious. They transported me to Medical Center Emergency Room, where I remained for several hours. They indicated that my SYNCOPE was a result of dehydration. TODAY, 4/13, news of BLOOD CLOTS has compelled me to report my adverse reaction.

It felt like I could not reduce my stress by taking deep breaths and letting it out slowly which was unusual because this usually works.

On April 8th woke up very dizzy, had to lay back down for a little bit.  On April 10th woke up not being able to take a deep breath without a very bad pain in my back (it felt like my right lung)  same issue the 11th, and 12th.  This pain was not severe unless I took a deep breath.  I was able to go about my daily activities.  Today April 13th still a little tight in my lung but do not have the pain in my back that I had the last few days.

The first few days after the shot, I was not concerned about the soreness, I knew it was a normal side affect. But at this point I am more concerned and do feel it is an  issue to be reported. This may keep me from getting the vaccine in the future.

Stayed off my feet. Right foot became very cold. 3/30/21 Saw my primary care physician at med center. She sent me for an ultrasound at medical arts. From there I was sent to the emergency room at hospital. I asked the attending physician assistant about a correlation between the blood clot and the Covid vaccine because I had read about it being a concern in other countries. He stated that was a bunch of baloney. Was told to have a repeat ultrasound in a few days and was prescribed a 30 day starter pack of Xarelto and released.  3/30 repeat penis ultrasound of right leg showed the same results. 4/1 appointment with hematologist. Prescribe Xarelto for three months and ordered a repeat ultrasound in three months and bloodwork at that time.

Patient reports that she felt lightheaded after the vaccine when she was leaving. She got home and felt better but then that night woke up in a delirium which passed by the morning. She had some weakness in her extremities, brain fog, cold feeling, funny GI feeling and fatigue for 3 days and then was fine.   Two weeks ago she started to feel that the circulation in her lower legs was cut off with sensation of blood pooling in her legs with associated numbness and tingling. She describes it as what you feel when a tourniquet is applied to your arm.  No visible lower extremity swelling, redness and no pain.    One week ago she felt like her right hand was not working well and then left hand too. She then felt pooling in her arms like the sensation in her legs.No swelling, redness or pain.   She reports she did a hand stand and afterward felt pooling sensation in her lower abdomen which has since resolved but continues to have a prickling sensation that comes and goes.   Last night while lying on her back she felt the pooling sensation in her chest and this morning throbbing in head and chest and neck. That is when she decided to come in and be seen.    Patient denies severe headache, backache, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, bruises, unusual bleeding or rashes.   Patient has not had a physical exam with blood work since 11/9/17.

Began at around 10am. Felt like I was dying. Placed on Stroke Unit. Scans and tests all negative for stroke and Drs. thought could be panic attack or TIA. Since then my lingering effects point to TIA, Seemed to clear up around 2pm with gradual improvement through the day. Still experiencing some side effects including tinnitus, memory and word retrieval issues, fatigue, anxiety.  DO NOT HAVE PANIC ATTACKS. The only time I have had a panic attack was at 26 after the death of my mother.

I could not bend over, lie down or sit for very long without severe discomfort. I ended up seeing a chiropractor within the week who has been treating the problem over this past month.  X rays were taken. I have been treating it with ice, ibuprofen, and aspirin.

I took a Zyrtec-D the morning of the injection so I think that helped keep the swelling under control.  April 15, 2021-around 6:00 pm I became very nauseous and dizzy.  The nausea subsided by the next morning but the dizziness has continued to this day.  Had to stay in bed all day April 17 and 18 due to dizziness.

                                                Immediately after my J&amp;J vaccine, I experienced soreness to my left arm, fatigue , dizziness and a bad headache. In the middle of the night my headache kept getting worse, my eyes started to hurt really bad and I also broke out in hives. About 6 hours later my headache felt like it wanted to explode. I saw a doctor through Tele-health by  who prescribed a 6pk of steroids.  Then on Day 6, my headaches came back along with the hives and I felt really tired and the hives broke out all over my body including my crotch and ear canal. He prescribed a 6pk of steroids and I started to feel and get better. On Day9, all of my symptoms were resolved except for the fatigue. To this day I still continue to have fatigue.

                                                8 hours after getting the vaccine I started feeling very cold. It came on me all of a sudden.  Shaking, shivering, teeth chattering ensued along with generally feeling very unwell.  (Similar to how I felt years ago after having surgery)  This progressed during the night to fever, chills, extreme body aches, stabbing pains in the head, heart racing, dizziness and nausea.  After 12 hours I started to feeling improvement.  At the 16 hour mark I am really tired and nauseous but feel like I&#39;m coming back.  Probably the worst I&#39;ve ever felt.  We considered going to the ER in the night.

                                                started vomiting at 1:30 and I felt really dizzy and confused. My roommate found me on the floor passed out. I am not sure how long I was passed out. I woke up and I was talking gibberish. I was aware that nothing I said was making sense. I went to bed and slept almost 24 hours. I woke up feeling wiped out but I wasn&#39;t confused and I was talking normal again. Right arm hurt and is numb. ( right side of my body typically is kind of numb but the right arm seemed more so numb after the vaccine)

                                                The actual injection itself was so painful that I almost passed out. It hurts so badly while the needle was in my arm and when she took it out it was worse. I was in such pain that I began to sweat profusely and apparently I turned white and began dry heaving. This was all within a minute or so.  I really thought I was going to pass out. A woman with a tag that said pharmacist came rushing over. She got a reclining chair with wheels, they help me into it and then took me to a recovery room. After a few more minutes of sweating and dry heaving I began feeling better.  The pharmacist got me some paper towels so I could dry myself off as I was drenched in sweat. I asked her for a bottle of water. I waited the 15 minutes and came home.  They never checked my vital signs. Once I got home, I laid down and slept for 15 hours. I was fine the next day and my arm was never sore.  Could  the shot have hit a nerve? I?ve never felt such acute pain.

Mild flu the next day with  general Malaise.  The chills were so intense that I was constricted for much of the time with little relieve. I would call them violent chills with a tetany kind of full body involvement.  Never have  I experienced chills like I have described. I?ve never had a reaction to vaccines and tend have a high tolerance. I did not contact my physician but spoke to colleagues who suggested  report the experience.

                                                I started running a fever and aching very bad Saturday morning. By Saturday afternoon my fever was up to 103.5.  I did not want to go to the hospital, but I came very close to calling. I decided to try ice packs on my forehead, neck and chest. I have never had a fever this high, or ached this bad. I don&#39;t know how long it took for my fever to come down, but finally came down to 102.5, where it stayed throughout the rest of the day and into Sunday.  I continued to use the ice packs throughout Sunday. I drank a lot of water and took Tylenol for fever and pain. I had a fever for three days. Today, Tuesday, 3/17/2021, I am very light headed.  I was diagnosed with covid-19 on Dec 29th 2020.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the single dose at 10:40.  In approximately 11 minutes I started to experience shortness of breath.  I thought it was my N95 mask so decided to head to the car after my 15 minute wait period was completed.  After sitting down in the car I started the following symptoms:  shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, swelling of face, dizziness, weakness.  I sit in the car for approximately 15 minutes then headed home.  I had a driver (thank goodness).  I continued to have symptoms and what felt like elevated blood pressure (I did not have access to a pressure cuff).  After resting at my driver&#39;s house for about 5 hours I felt better and headed home.  The next morning the symptoms were less but still present.  In addition I had a slight rash on my stomach that wrapped around my back.  After approximately 48 hours all of the symptoms subsided.  My blood pressure had returned to normal also.  All swelling went down.

                                                I started experiencing dizziness when my head turned in a specific position. This began about one week after the vaccination. At the next VSAFE check I reported that I was having some dizziness and tiredness. However, I saw a doctor on April 2 and he diagnosed me with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo and treated me in his office using the Epley Maneuver. The dizziness was cured and I am not experiencing it any longer. I do not believe it was associated with the vaccination but had not seen my doctor when I completed the report on VSAFE.

                                                Four days after I received the vaccine (this week Tuesday), I suddenly felt very dizzy and faintish.  I sat down until the dizzy spell passed.  I felt very cold and clammy and nauseous.  My hands were very shaky. I  felt very weak and very tired so I slept the whole day.  Today I woke up and felt the same dizziness, very cold hands and nauseous.  Both times I had diarrhea.  I have never had dizzy spells before so I know this has to be vaccine related.

I expected this, but a few days later I was still having what I describe as migraine type headaches and at one point I was sweating profusely, dizzy massive headache with not only nausea, but  dry heaving so bad I could barely get to my medication and seriously thought it would never subside.  I continued with headaches up until today April 14.  This is the first day I have not had a headache.  I contacted my vascular doctor as I had a blood clot several years ago and he has prescribed Eliquis twice a day for the next 2 weeks.   Today marks 2 weeks and like I said, it&#39;s the first day I have not had a headache

Began having a dry cough, went to nurse to as if normal, she said no, she started monitoring me. Still had cough, then became light headed and nausea. She gave me 25 mg of  Benadryl,  coughing continued, breathing became rapid, then I was given  shot of epi,  I became dizzy again and couldn?t complete a sentence. Words were slurred, heart beat racing. EMT?s were called. Received another shot of  Benadryl. It did not counteract anything. Received another shot of epi. Had uncontrollable shakes and hard to breathe or speak.  Was difficult to get BP reading due to shaking. Finally got reading of 196/99. EMT listened to heart and lungs. Said all was good. Taken to ER for monitoring of heart, Lungs and BP. Was there for approximately 2 hours u til shakes and BP were good.

                                                On Tuesday, April 6, 2021, about 11:45 am, I felt a sudden sharp pain in the right temple area just above eye level and about 2 inches posterior.  I also felt some dizziness and wondered if I was having a stroke or some type of arterial inflammation.  At the time I was treating a patient and wondered if I was going to have to leave to go home.  I did get through the rest of my workday but had difficulty concentrating.  I had recurring waves of pain in the same area several times that day and into the evening, was considering alerting my adult daughter that I might need to go to a hospital.  Fortunately, resting and increased fluids seemed to resolve the pain and it was mostly gone by the next day.

                                                Sudden onset extreme dizziness/vertigo. So severe and sudden I called 911 because I felt I might lose consciousness. Followed by nausea and violent vomiting. (EMT Vitals were all normal and they didn&#39;t think it was an allergic reaction this long after vaccine so I declined hospital ER visit.)  After several hours of severe dizziness I developed violent chills with heavy breathing that lasted 20 minutes then stopped.  Much improved after 24 hours but two days later I still have considerable dizziness. Headaches occurred Earlier in the week but none with onset of dizziness. Otherwise I experienced the typical fatique and flulike vaccine side effects with no pain at injection site about 2 days after vaccination that lasted several days.

                                                2 hours after receiving the vaccine, I grew exhausted and had to sleep into late evening and was chilled,  had a fever of 101 and developed severe pain and inflammation on the top of my collar bone that was feverish and migrated toward my shoulder region on the same side as my vaccine. Ibuprofen would not help with the pain but helped with the fever. My mind told me that I had things to tend to the next day, but still was forced to sleep off and on for 2 more days. After a week and a half, not only did I have thirst, but also food didn&#39;t taste right and was metallic.  This lasted for 2 days and finally my taste was restored. The exhaustion lasted off and on for 2 weeks and I just listened to my body. The pain and inflammation on my collar bone has subsided 4 days ago but still have pain in my shoulder when I sleep.  On April 5 around 8:30 a.m. a nasty virus hit me out of the blue. I grew week and tired and had to go to bed. I slept all day until around 9:00 p.m. and woke to uncontrollable diarrhea and fainting spell while in the bathroom. I had abominable pain and nausea that last for a half hour and then I returned to bed. The next 2 days, I was week and exhausted but continued with my regular routine.  My equilibrium is still affected from time to time.

They took me in a room to lay down and said my blood pressure had dropped vary low.  After an out of doing better I just needed t get home. So another hour passes and I get home, go directly to bed and what seems like a bad flu begins.   That night my temperature continues to climb, the aches and headache are horrible.  I continue fevers for 3 nights.  Feel a little better and then with 2 days it relapse and all starts again.  I am in bed for 1 and 1/2 weeks, then stay home due to continued headache, dizziness.  After 3 weeks the dizziness continues and I then start getting an aching pain in the back of my left leg.  Seeing my doctor on May 11th and hope to discuss.

Where she injected me was very high up on my arm almost close to the top.  The pain at injection site was quite sore for the first few days and then went away for the most part for a day or two but has now come back much worse.  It hurts to lift my arm or move it and feels like I&#39;ve lost strength to raise my arm.   I am in constant pain now and my arm around the injection site is painful when I press down especially on the bony area.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported.  The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included seasonal allergies, and codeine allergy. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1802068, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 05-MAR-2021 to left arm as prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 06-MAR-2021, after vaccination, she felt fine all day and night. The next morning she woke up and felt sick. She had nausea, headache, hive under eye. She laid back down and tried to sleep. A few hours later, she woke up to use the bathroom. She was very nauseous and dizzy. She lost consciousness and fell trying to get to the bathroom. She fell on her bed and was uninjured. The paramedics took her to the hospital. She was given medication for nausea, headache, and IV fluids. She gave blood for lab tests and they came back normal. No COVID test was administered. When she felt better, she was released. A few days later, she discovered her tongue was sore and red. She called her primary care physician (PCP). PCP said the red and sore tongue was probably related to allergies. Two weeks later, her tongue was not sore, but still red. They advised her to get a second opinion with another HCP. She was going to visit her allergy specialist.. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea, fatigue, inflammation on left eye, and small hives under eye on MAR-2021, and vomiting on 07-MAR-2021, and had not recovered from canker sore under tongue, and the outcome of fall on bed was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged).  Additional information was received from the patient on 23-Mar-2021. The following information was updated and incorporated into case narrative: Patient&#39;s medical history added as seasonal allergies and codeine allergy, Vaccination site as left arm added; Additional events as small hives under eye, fall on bed; lab test of blood work added; Event outcome of loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea, and fatigue was updated to recovered/resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: v1: Follow up information received updates  patient&#39;s medical history (seasonal allergies and codeine allergy), Vaccination site as left arm; Additional events (small hives under eye and fall on bed), laboratory test (Blood Work); Event outcome  (loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea and fatigue was updated to recovered/resolved). This updated information does not alter prior causality assessment of reported events 20210323730-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S-headache, nausea and fatigue. These events are labeled and are therefore considered potentially related. 20210323730-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S-loss of consciousness, fainted, heart racing, dizzy, vomiting, canker sore under tongue. These events are considered unassessable. The events have a compatible/suggestive temporal relationship, are unlabeled, and have unknown scientific plausibility. There are no information on any other factors potentially associated with the events.

The next morning I was very tired. As time progressed, I felt like I HAD to be horizontal. No energy at all. No appetite at all. Took my temperature and was shocked to see it at 101.4º. Pharmacist suggested I take aspirin, which I took one, and then another one several hours later. It did help and reduced the fever to 99º.  The following day the temperature remained at 99º but under 100º. (I never took any other aspirin other than the two that I mentioned). The third day I was good to go!

I had a little itching at the shot site.  That went away in about 15 mins.  Late afternoon I had a slight headache. 4/1/21 Day 2:  Morning was normal.  Afternoon I started feeling a little sluggish.  I had a little headache. 4/2/21 Day 3: Morning was slow.  I noticed that I was tired.  Headache was stronger.  I took Ibuprofen 400mg. By mid day, I was on the couch the rest of the day.  My body was telling me to rest.  So I did.

I had to regulate my breathing by slowing it down. When I opened my eyes the light was so bright I had to keep them closed. I thought I was going to faint. I finally decided to put my head between my legs and then I started too pullout of it.  Very scary feeling.   This lasted for 10min.

On the 12th had severe chest pains which I chalked up to a very bad case of heart burn.  On March 24th, while driving I had two major (what I thought at the time) was panic attacks...body started shaking, heart was beating like crazy, couldn&#39;t catch my breath, felt like I was going to pass out or die.  Had to pull over twice to calm myself down.  (From what I read this could be a sign of a blood clot but I am not a doctor.)  Had minor heart burn until April 5th....which ironically was the end of my 28 days until the vaccine fully kicked in.  Just reporting what happen.  I feel fine now.

This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: v0 This report involves a patient who experienced sinus inflammation, sensation of pressure in ear, injection site lump, chills, felt ill, injection site pain and fatigue next day after receiving Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Ad26.COV2.S for prophylactic vaccination. Approximately a week later, the patient experienced stomach cramps and diarrhea and 1.5 weeks later she had foggy feeling in head and &#34;believes the vaccine is contaminated&#34;, had fever blister, facial pain and vertigo. Approximately 3.5 weeks after being vaccinated the patient experienced pressure choking and difficulty swallowing. A throat (ENT) specialist was unable to diagnose and they felt there was some autoimmune effects. A month after being vaccinated the patient experienced stomach burning sensation, night sweats and tooth pain. Given the close temporal relationship and the nature of the events, the events of sinus inflammation, sensation of pressure in ear, injection site lump, chills, felt ill, injection site pain and fatigue are considered related to the vaccination. The insufficient information precludes a meaningful medical assessment of the remaining events, including &#34;autoimmune effects&#34;. The events will be assessed further when additional information is received.

Went to urgent care on unspecified date. NP examined me and discovered a lump in my arm. Both the lump and the vaccination site hurt when she pressed on them. She prescribed presdone and gave me a work order for a vascular ultrasound to be performed on my left arm. I went on unspecified date for the scan. It was discovered that a DVT blood clot had formed in my brachial vein in the left arm. I was then prescribed eliquis, 20 mg a day for 7 days and told not to take the predesone. NP called my pcp, his office immediately called me and asked me to come in as they are concerned about the high dosage of the eliquis.

The muscle is still affected and strained after 6 days. I waited a half hour at the site and got into my car at 3:45. On the drive home within 30 minutes my face started to itch and turn red, then my mouth inside started to itch, then my eyes started to itch. After that my throat started to feel gravely, so I took 75 mgs of gel cap benedryl. This is what I feel and take upon getting stung by a bee. I also took my albuterol inhaller two puffs which I also always have on me because of my asthma. I was sleepy but had dinner and went to be. I did not feel that I had to take more benedryl during the night.

Symptoms became severe within 30 minutes thereafter, at which time I experienced difficulty standing. After five hours with no improvement, I used my home blood pressure monitor to check my BP and HR; BP was high for me, 120/90 sustained, and HR varied between 135 and 150, with 143 being the most consistent value after multiple readings. I seemed to be experiencing a &#34;severe allergic reaction&#34; per the instructions I was given and called 9-1-1. I was transported to Hospital, treated in ER, and then admitted to the intermediate care unit. I was discharged to home on 3-12-21.

                                                Immediately after the shot, I felt dizzy and started to sweat throughout my body including my hands.  I waited more than 40 minutes to see if improved but it was exactly the same. Didn&#39;t get better or worse. I did not report it immediately because it was not alarming and I did not feel bad. It was just my head that was spinning a little bit and sweating. After waiting more than 45 minutes I decided to drive home because the dizziness was not that strong. I would say it was like a 45% dizzyness if I have to calculate how I felt. The sweating passed after 4 hours and at soon as I arrived home I went to bed and relax. It is now 6:08 pm and the dizziness has improved considerably. I would calculate now about 10% of that vertigo feeling. It is getting better and better. I just wanted to point out that in no time I was feeling bad. Everything was just in my hearing labyrinth internal with balance. I also felt 20 minutes of echoing in my ears about 2 hours ago.

At 5:30pm, same day, became immediate flush, dizzy, barely made it to bathroom, violently vomiting all that was in my stomach.  This was followed by severe chills, the shakes and a mild headache.  Took (2) Tylenol at the time of the shot, drank many ounces of water all day but still had this issue. Took another (2) Tylenol after vomiting and more water. Went to bed at 8pm.  Woke at midnight, 4/5/21, severe headache, now took (2) Advil and slept better until Mon. Morning, 4/5/2021.  Experienced two sluggish, low energy days and still have no appetite. What the heck????

                                                I wasn&#39;t sure how to indicate which dose I&#39;m reporting on.  It&#39;s my second dose of a vaccine but my first of Johnson &amp; Johnson.  My first shot for Covid-19 was a Moderna shot, to which I had a bad reaction (immediate and prolonged lightheadedness reported already on this site).  My doctor advised me that my second dose should be a Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, as per information he had received from the CDC.  So, 28 days after the first shot I had the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.  I experienced the expected side effects of body aches, chills, headache--no big deal on day 2, but on day 3, I started some lightheadedness, as did my daughter who had the shot the same day.  Her lightheaded subsided the next day, but mine continued into day 4 and got worse when it became accompanied by pressure in my head/ears, and it felt like I was talking in a tunnel with echoing.  I couldn&#39;t function the rest of the day.  Today, the head pressure is not there, but the lightheadedness and shakiness are still there.  I hope I fully recover from these shots, but I don&#39;t have a lot of hope.

Patient waited in waiting area and complained to her husband about feeling dizzy and might faint. Pharmacists went to aid the patient and lay her down gently, monitored her blood pressure which was high at the time, once patient sat up her BP decreased, it fluctuated the whole time, EMT was called and once they arrived and monitored her, they said the cause of her fainting was due to her blood pressure. Patient was alert and responsive the whole time. Patient was unsure if she took her BP medicine this morning.

                                                2 weeks post inoculation developed burning sensation/tingling /pain from armpit to thumb; some tingling in thumb - sensation more like nerve pain vs muscle pain.  After two days gradually improved.  Muscle strength not affected, but movement in most directions elicited sharp pain coursing down arm.  Gradually improving to pain over the deltoid near injection site;  as of 19 days since initial pain motility much improved but still periodically throbs and sensitive to pressure and certain movements.   No treatment except restricting use of arm and time.  10 hrs post inoculation developed chills, myalgia and headache.  Chills and myalgia resolved in a few hours; an aspirin the next day resolved the headache.    This reaction was not unexpected.  Did not have pain at injection site until 2 weeks post injection.

She reported these on 4/19/21. I advised her to contact her PCP to get evaluated for the signs/symptoms that she is experiencing to rule out anything severe. She did not seem to understand and asked to speak with the manufacturer. She said that she would contact the manufacturer and walked away.  When I attempted to contact her again today on 4/20/21, the phone number she provided to us has been disconnected and we have no means of reaching her at this point in time. I am hoping she heeded my advice and contacted her PCP to get evaluated.

                                                Patient received Janseen COVID vaccine. The first 1/2 of the vaccine was given easily IM to the left deltoid and then the patient complained of severe arm pain, tensed her muscles, and the last 0.25ml was difficult to inject. Then the patient became hypotensive 90/45, dizzy, and felt like she was going to pass out. She was laid in the supine position, given a cool cloth for her forehead and monitored for approx. 45 minutes. Her blood pressure remained 90/60, 96/56 at discharge. Her heart rate ranged from 55-65, regular. Her son came to take her home as we did not feel comfortable with the patient driving. The patient was continuously monitored by the NPs and APCT. She ambulated without difficulty and was discharged home. She was given information for V-safe to report her reaction and advised to follow up in the ER for any SOB, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, syncope, CP, etc.

                                                At the time, I had very mild injection site pain and warmth on the site. For a couple of days. On Monday, the 15th, I had the worst flare-up of sciatica that I have ever had in my life. Left leg - it had a tremendous swelling. It was crippling. I am still using a pain. I cried because the pain was so horrific. I was able to get into the doctor early on Tuesday - prescribed Prednisone; hydrocodone; muscle relaxer. None of which touched the pain. I was unable to sleep for three days. I slept upright in a chair. I used an office chair as a wheel chair. I wasn&#39;t able to lay down. I&#39;ve improved but I still can&#39;t walk to the mailbox - could walk down there - two houses down but couldn&#39;t get back. I am using a cane still. I have to elevate leg on a recliner to sleep so it will help with the continued swelling. There was nothing I did that triggered it.

                                                About 4 and a half weeks after getting the J&amp;J vaccine, I began to experience marked symptoms: dizziness and disorientation,, balance problems, bilateral numbness in hands, feet and tip of tongue, awareness of left side of brain, intermittent mild nausea (likely related to dizziness).  These symptoms had a sudden onset. I am normally very healthy and active so these unusual symptoms without any illness were quite a departure from my normal health. They have, to date, persisted continually since onset over the past 3 weeks. They are very concerning. Last night I went to the ER to be seen since I could not get an appt. with a neurologist for several months and I am concerned about my sudden change in health status.

                                                No problems the remainder of day of injection. Next morning upon awakening, I was very groggy and unable to stay awake. I slept 4 hours past my normal time for getting up. I had no balance and would stagger when standing. My entire body was in muscle and nerve pain. Even my skin hurt. I took 300 mg of Gabapentine which eased my pain. I continued to be off balance the remainder of the day, however, by the end of the day I was much better. I took several 1 hour naps throughout the day.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Approximately six hours after administration of the vaccine, patient experienced sever chills and dizziness. Unable to stop shaking, patient took temperature which registered at 95.4F and then 95.1F at 15 minutes. Patient donned flannel pants, thermal shirt, and oversized hooded sweatshirt and got in bed under flannel sheets, two doubled-over blankets, a bedspread, and quilt. A down-filled king-size pillow was placed on top of patient&#39;s torso and a space heater was turned on to highest setting. Patient reports heart seemed to be racing, but did not take BP. Unable to quell the chills, the patient continued to shake, developing very stiff shoulders, neck and back as a result. This continued until approximately 2 am. The next morning, patient&#39;s temperature was registering at 99.4F and pulse was 96, but patient did not report chills. General muscle aches and mild headache were noted. At time of this report, patient&#39;s temperature and pulse are normal (97.6F and 76 pulse).

Later at night I had a low grade fever with achiness and headache. The flu like symptoms resolved by morning but I continue to have vertigo and intermittent nausea and my BP was still high in the morning around 9 am but came down by 12:45 to my normal range.  Paramedics at the site did a BP, pulse ox, blood sugar, ECG . Everything was normal except my BP which was 180/90.  This morning it was 167/98 and 168/97.  No treatment.  Saw my doctor&#39;s partner at 1:00 today and BP was back to my normal range but I still have mild vertigo and intermittent nausea.  Doc gave me some exercises to do for the vertigo and did not seem to think that it was related to the shot, but since the paramedics said they had seen a LOT of the same reaction yesterday to the J&amp;J shot and two sites in other cities shut down for the same reactions, nobody will convince me that it was anything but the shot. I expected the flu like side effects but never dreamed it would cause my  BP to spike and the vertigo.

                                                The shot was painful but that wasn?t unexpected. I immediately felt woozy after the shot but thankfully I had brought a cold full sugar ginger ale and started drinking it. My sensation was kind of like a low blood sugar event where a soda can help. I was not surprised to feel this way and felt somewhat reluctant to report this as I didn?t really think it was unusual. and I didn?t report  it at the time. The shot was at a drive up event at a University.. After chugging the ginger ale I felt a bit better and was given the  ok to leave after 15 minutes. Back at work, I felt  better but still just a bit  ? off?.  But this passed in an hour and I was good the rest of the day. For a few days afterwards  I had a mild headache but no other real symptoms.  My usual  blood pressure under medications is 116/72.  It could be possible that the shot caused some lower blood pressure immediately or within the hour  after the shot?  Or perhaps the effect was low blood sugar for which the ginger ale helped.

We called the emergency services when they arrived she had collapsed. They broke the window and took her to the hospital, upon arrival we were informed that she has got a hemorrhage possible clotting due to high blood pressure. I now know the term is Cerebral Hemorrhage, she has been in ICU on a ventilation machine while they tried to drain the blood and clots. She&#39;s currently out of ICU however still complains about headache and back pain. We are informed that she has now developed some blood pressure and diabetes however it could be cleared in the short term. She&#39;s at the hospital and unknown how long she would have to stay there.

                                                15-20 minutes after the injection, I started feeling a tightness in back of my throat; I broke out in cold sweat. I started getting dizzy and very whoozy. I felt my vision starting to close in. I thought I was going to pass out. I got the attention of the person across me to get an attendant and they brought me a chair with wheels. Two people got me up (and I&#39;m not a big person) - they were worried I was going down and I was taken to exam room. They said I was white as a sheet. She checked my eyes and throat a few times and checked my blood pressure. It was lower than normal but she didn&#39;t seem really concerned about it - 104 over 60 something which is low for me. She gave me water to sip. She gave me very cold compresses to put on my forehead. They watched me pretty good. She had the epi-pen ready. She watched me and I sat in there and nurse came in a quite a few times to check me for about an hour. About an hour later the tightness went away and I started feeling myself again. We went home. I went to sleep. I woke up at night to go to bathroom and I was still a little woozy but I didn&#39;t fall. Next day, I just didn&#39;t feel well. My left arm was starting to hurt - was no swelling; it was a little red at injection site. It hurt just a little. I was woozy. My eyes couldn&#39;t focus as well. I felt out of it. I drank a lot of water and took a nap.  Yesterday, I felt pretty decent but still woozy somewhat. I tried to run errands with my husband  - just wasn&#39;t quite right. Today, much better but I&#39;m not quite myself yet. Just a little wooziness - weird feeling. Yesterday, I did feel a soreness in the back of my right calf muscle. It wasn&#39;t warm to the touch or swollen. I don&#39;t have it anymore, it went away.  It could have been a muscle thing from the first day of the vaccine when I got home and I got up and almost fell down. I do still have some achiness in joints. Especially in my knees - which isn&#39;t normal because they are replaced.

                                                I woke up on 3/16/21 feeling my heart beating rapidly. I was slight dizzy upon standing from bed. I took my blood pressure at 6:06 -- readings were 112/84 and 120BPM. My usual BPM is between 60 and 75.   I meditated and took my readings again at 7:44 a.m.. They were 105/78 and 95 BPM. I verified this on an oximeter.

My heart rate stayed at 109 or more until 10 PM the next night when its slowly went down to a normal heart rate.  At 3 am  (12 hours after the shot) i had  a blinding debilitating headache that lasted until 9pm the next night.   It also affected my vision.   The headache was so bad i could not concentrate on the simplest task.  I  was unsure of what i could take for the headache.   So, I did not take anything.    When i woke up i was very tired and this lasted until the following day.  6am i had a fever of 102.3 this went down to 100.4 at 9:15 pm that night.  I also had chills for several hours. 9:20 AM  the nausea started followed by vomiting and dizziness.   This only lasted for a few hours.    I  experienced very vivid dreams the night of the shot.    I only drank some coconut water all day and could not eat any food.  The next day Saturday March 27 i felt better but the fatigue did not go away until late in the evening.   Sleeping seemed to help but i could only sleep for 2- 3 hours at the most.

She felt well enough to leave the pharmacy on her own after 25-30 minutes.  The  patient had a prior history of anxiety prior to receiving vaccinations and was very nervous about getting the vaccination prior to administration.  The patients daughter was with her and felt that her symptoms were due to anxiety about  getting vaccinated, but later called the pharmacy asking to report the adverse events as being related to receiving the vaccine.  It is not known weather or not the symptoms are directly related to the vaccine.

                                                About an hour after having the shot, I was nauseous, dizzy and light headed, I thought I was going to pass out.  I had to lay down. My eyes swelled and they started to tear up, I felt weak all day and into the evening. I never had a bad reaction to a vaccine before, so this was surprising.  I contacted the health department as they came to my house and gave me the shot, but I could not get through to anyone. I had to leave a message. After I was contacted back, I was told that someone would contact me that very same day, but no one ever did that day or any other day. .Because of that, I thought it must not have been a big deal, but after reading today that people in a specific had some of the same reactions I did, I thought I should report it.

I have never had this until got this shot.

I went to my Primary Care doctor, he examined my leg and immediately sent me to hospital ER because he was concerned that it might be a blood clot. They performed an ultrasound, but the results were negative and showed no signs of any blood clots. (2) Approximately three weeks after vaccine, I developed stiffness on the left side of my body in my arm, thigh and hip area. The stiffness was intense, uncomfortable and bothersome enough for me to take Tylenol for the pain the next 5 days and it lasted for about a week.

(I have never felt that burning sensation with any other vaccination that I have had in the past. Twenty minutes after the vaccination, I became lightheaded and dizzy.  I could walk but I was wobbly. At one hour after the vaccination, I felt a sharp stabbing pain in the left side of my tongue and then the left side and only the left side of my tongue began to go numb. Within a couple of minutes, I realized that my left jaw was going numb, too.  The numbness slowly but surely began to move up the left side of my face all the way to the top of my head.  I had a sharp but brief headache on the left side of my head  that subsided quickly but the numbness remained.  I went home and talked to two people on the phone for several hours because they wanted to be sure that I was OK. At two hours after the vaccination, my face was still numb but I could think and talk clearly, but I was clearing my throat and coughing a lot.  At that point, I also realized that my whole left arm was a little numb and my fingers on my left hand were tingling.  That numbness lasted about 20 minutes and then subsided. The facial numbness lasted for hours.  I wasn&#39;t scared and I wasn&#39;t in pain but it was very strange.  It felt a little bit like the after affects of dental anesthesia but it wasn&#39;t just in my mouth it was the whole left side of my face.   I believe that this must have been an allergic reaction to one of the chemicals in the vaccine but I don&#39;t know which one.  If you can tell me which chemical it might have been, I will avoid it in the future.

Only a few moments after, pt started to experience 8-10 minutes of nausea and light-headedness. RPH came over to provide care, asked more about past experiences - pt admitted that a long time ago she experienced nervousness and has had this feeling before. She states she has not had such a reaction since she was a child and was also embarrassed for the incident occurring in front of others.

About a week later I noticed a huge black bruise on my L  hip with a knot in the middle of it - it is still there but much lighter. Some days later I noticed a bruise on my R knee. Today I noticed a bruise on my R forearm. I do take a low does aspirin every day. I did get a little dizzy a couple of times and when I look up I get vertigo - not sure if that is related.

Which is also unusual as I am a gardener and wear one all summer. More than usual fatigue, still happening. Dry heaves and felt  like I had a hang over for two days too! I have never had a problem with my gall bladder or liver which I know are on the right had side also.

                                                First, the injection was far more painful than anticipated (and it bled down my arm).  My arm immediately ached intensely.  Approximately 10 minutes after injection, I began to sweat profusely, followed by intensifying extreme lightheadedness. I could not stand, or lift my head, as I would have definitely passed out.  My shoulders and neck became extremely painful, as if ?frozen?, also preventing me from lifting my head.  After about 35 minutes I very gradually began to recover. It was about an hour before I began to move around normally.   Pharmacy and store staff  debated calling the paramedics, but I refused.  FYI, I had not been especially anxious about the vaccine, and I have never experienced such a reaction to anything in my life. It was a traumatic experience I would not wish to repeat.

On 04/06 She passed out while sitting in her chair, woke up and began throwing up. Had extreme short term memory loss and low blood pressure. On 04/08 while at her primary care Dr, he suggested a hospital visit with suspicion of possible stroke.  Was admitted  and released the following day. Dr advised possible mini strokes but could also be dehydration.  CBC with differential showed other results than dehydration.   Starting around 04/20 she started having chest pains and thought it was heart burn, after medication and another visit to her pcp she was admitted to the hospital again on 04/23.  Her troponin levels indicated a possible heart attack.  She had a heart catherization and was found to have a healthy heart.  Again, her blood pressure has been decreased since, her hgb and hct has also been low with a history of it being high.  A high WBC since all of this has started among other unexplained blood results.

I had to be taken by ambulance to the hospital on 4/17/2021 - I thought I was having a stroke. They said that I had developed bells palsy on the right side of my face. They gave me medication to use for one week. The symptoms that I was having went away less than two weeks later. They told me that Bells Palsy symptoms could last two weeks to six months. It&#39;s gone right now - I don&#39;t see any symptoms of it.  I did have a virtual appt appt with my doctor -

Body aches and stiffness, affected my walking.  Did not take temperature at that time.  Got back into bed with 2 blankets and a comforter and still couldn&#39;t sleep.  Got up a 7AM - temp 102.2, shaking less but still  feeling cold, body was hot to touch.  I had a bad headache and body aches and stiffness were still there. I noticed at that time  that I had a bright red flush on both cheeks and my nose that was hot to the touch.  Took 600mg of Ibuprofen.  Went back to bed feeling terrible.  At 12 noon I got back up and temp was down to 99.7.  Headache, body aches, stiffness, and &#34;red flush&#34; still on cheeks and nose.  Went back to bed.  Took more Ibuprofen at 7pm - temp was down to 98.7.  Headache was better, body aches improved.  Flushed hot face was still present.  Went to  sleep at 11:30PM  and slept for 10 hours.  Today, 03/06/21, all symptoms improved, no fever, redness of face is still present but less.

                                                about two hours after injection,  I experienced headache,  then mild dizziness,  then extreme dizziness,  then sudden overwhelming fatigue,  then swollen eyes and eyelids,  then chills and elevated heart rate,  with pounding.    I had to cancel the class I was supposed to teach,  because I would not have been safe to drive to campus.  I slept from approximately 2:30 pm on March 8 until 8:30 am today,  March 9,   all symptoms continuing,  with bathroom breaks, a couple of short reports to family members who were watching out for me,  and one  2-hour window during which I ate a small meal,  went back to bed,  and read part of a book.    During bathroom breaks I took more antronex,  some milk thistle,  and some glutathione,  which seemed to at least temporarily reduce dizziness and eye/eyelid swelling.  At one point I took some hawthorne tincture because I was concerned about the heart pounding.    Today I woke up feeling symptom-free,  but by 2 pm I was compelled by sudden fatigue to take a two-hour nap.   After that I felt better,  and I think I am now fine,  at 7:45 pm on 3/9/21.    I am happy to have gotten the Janssen vaccine,  because it is one and done!

                                                I had ligament repair surgery on my right ankle on 01/06/2021.  My recovery was going well.  I was walking well without pain and was gaining balance and strength with physical therapy.  I had almost no discomfort at the site of my surgery.  Three days after having my J&amp;J vaccination I woke up to a lot of discomfort in my right ankle, making it difficult for me to walk as I had been able to walk.  I have struggled over the last six days to get back to the mobility I had prior to getting my J&amp;J vaccination.  I spoke with representative from my orthopedic surgeon?s office this morning who confirmed that I am most likely suffering from the side effects of the J&amp;J vaccination, and she suggested that my lack of normal mobility will most likely last another week.

She took Tylenol and slept most of the next 36 hours.  After 3 days she still has a headache but started eating again.  Today she is feeling drained and still has a headache.

I could not go up and down steps as my legs would not hold me. Headache.  Week 2 to present. Fatigue, I have to nap every day and I sleep 8 hours or more at night.  Diarrhea, despite taking OTC medications  to control. Dehydration and dizziness. I am now 4 weeks since my shot on March 4th and I continue to have these symptoms.   I went to see my doctor and all lab tests are normal. There is no other diagnose reason for my continued symptoms. I wish I waited to get either the Pfizer shot or Moderna as I have not heard of these extreme and prolonged side effects from those shots.

Vomiting lasted for one session, but dizziness and nausea stayed for about 3 hours, and then nausea, fatigue and general sick feeling kept me in bed until the next day. April 9 I woke up still feeling out of sorts, but not as bad. Note: 28 minutes after having the vaccine, once I started driving home, the vision in my left eye suddenly went blurry, and I nearly lost vision in that eye. I tried to find a safe place to pull over but couldn&#39;t. After 5-8 minutes the vision came back but stayed a bit blurry for a couple hours. Never had any such thing happen before.

I woke up (Wed.) with  NAUSEA and took the &#34;anti-nausea&#34; pills that I had left over from when I had COVID (11 - 2020).  My upper arm was now very sore, especially when I tried to lift it.  I took my temp. and I had a FEVER (101). On Thurs., my temp. went down to 99.5 and the nausea was gone.  Today (Fri.), I woke up with pain on my shoulder (over the injection site). I took Advil and iced it and it is now much better (this eve.). The only side effect I have now is the pain in my arm (mostly when I lift it). I am eating better and sleeping better now.

                                                Very severe muscle aches, headache, and shivering within hrs after receiving vaccine. Lasted all night into today.  Dizzy and needed help walking. Seemed very extreme for a vaccine reaction.  Starting to feel a little better but I am loaded up with  Tylenol and Advil.

                                                Many lasting for 2 weeks - pain, nausea, diarrhea, extreme weakness and fatigue, dizziness, fever and chills, cold sweats,, headache, brain fog, dyspnea on exertion, dry mouth.  Medicated with Tylenol, bananas, oatmeal and herbal tea.  Documented on pdf form, but unable to use &#34;continuation page&#34;, so added sheet that unable to attach.  Will try again to upload and send separately to this.  NO forms given to me at pharmacy for reporting anything.  I called several times and left messages, but no return call.  Sent email, but response saying unable to help at this time.  Very frustrating as I continued having severe symptoms and unable to get help.  Finally feeling better enough today to send form.

                                                Around 5:30 pm on Friday night, I started feeling really cold; couldn&#39;t get warm for 2 hours. Then I started getting a fast heart rate; checked this around 7 pm; BP was 181/80 and heart rate was 135.  I was starting to feel warm along with being cold.  I had a gradually increasing temperature; checked it around 8:30 pm; was 102.1; took 2 tylenol and temperature slowly started going down.  My heart would not slow down; I sat in my recliner and kept deep breathing and had calming herbal tea; was afraid to go to the ER due to Covid.  After more than 4 hours with a racing heart, I felt exhausted and laid down around 12:30 a.m. and fell asleep.  I woke around 3 am with nausea and soaking wet pajamas from sweating.  I fell asleep again and woke around 7 am; I felt very tired, woozy and my heart hurt.  I felt a bit more normal after a few days.  I still feel a bit dizzy and light headed.  I was concerned when I later heard some J&amp;J vaccines were contaminated; on 4/2/21, I called the pharmacy because the number they wrote on my card, 1805D18 wasn&#39;t clear; they told me this # was incorrect and should be 037A21B and couldn&#39;t explain why this was so. They were going to check into  this and call me; I called them again on 4/5/21 and was told the correct # was 043A21A and that the vaccine was from the Netherlands.  They couldn&#39;t offer any more information or explain why the initial # was incorrect. I find this concerning and have been unable to find an answer.

At the same time it felt like my head (in notch immediately forward of middle of ear to ear)  was in a tightening vise.  Then I got hot and cold  but not severely.  Same for dizziness, very mild. I was nasusseous and not able to eat.  I had random muscles pains , none lasting more than a few minutes in any one place. Odd thing was that I felt no discomfort at sight of injection. Next day I felt just as bad but at 8:30pm I felt like throwing up (after having 2 teaspons of vegetarian vegetable soup). However, I only had dry heaves. I live by myself and started to get scared. I called my daughter and took a Tylenol at 9pm. Within 10 minutes the feeling of a vise and my aching teeth felt significantly better. but  stil very fatigued. Next day, today,  I feel much better but still a little foggy headed. I can eat. I can function normally, thank heavens. If I had to take another shot now, I wouldn&#39;t. Not even sure I&#39;ll take a booster when it comes out . It was very scarey.

She waited 30 minutes (since she stated she got a rash as a kid from a vaccine and hadn&#39;t received a vaccine since then).  She was fine after 30 minutes and handed us the timer and walked away.  She came back and said she thought she is just hungry since she hadn&#39;t eaten and felt funny.  She said she was going to get some food.  We had associate walk her over.  They came back.  She sat down and ate her food.  We checked on her but now she stated she had vertigo and needed meclizine and thought she&#39;d be ok if she went home and laid down. I offered her ice for her neck or head and she refused.  I also offered to lay her on the floor and elevate her feet, but she refused.  She said her neck gives her problems so didn&#39;t want ice or to lower her neck. She was sitting this whole time and said she felt in slow motion.  She said she wanted to go to the restroom but I didn&#39;t want her going alone. She called her son in law that was shopping in the store and we asked him to come over.  He was going to drive her home but she said no one was home.  I asked if they&#39;d like an ambulance and they both said yes.  We called 911 and stayed with the patient until EMS arrived.  She was feeling somewhat better but they took her to get checked out to be safe.

First we tried nsaids, then steroids, took various tests including Covid test. I was negative. All this took about 2 months. May 4 was last steroid pill. Nsaids had no good effect. Steroids helped quite a bit, but not totally. The day after the last steroid pill, all the aches, pains, everything came back.

In the morning, her entire arm was covered in blood and her sheets wet. Her husband cleaned her up, and the next day, she did not have any bleeding.  But then the second night, again overnight, she bled heavily and woke up with her arm covered in blood and sheets wet with blood.  She also experienced leg pain so bad that she couldn&#39;t walk.  This happened after she had done some leg exercises in which she used a tension band.
