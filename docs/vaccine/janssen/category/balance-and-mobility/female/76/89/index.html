                                                The patient is a 76 y.o. female who presents to the Emergency Department with three days of left ankle pain and swelling status post mechanical GLF. Patient reports that she fell onto her left side three days ago. She is not anticoagulated and denies striking her head or any LOC. Since then she has had constant dull left ankle pain which is acutely worsened with ROM and weight bearing. Patient reports a history of fracture to this ankle.

She has pain radiating up her LLE, into her buttocks, and up her back &#34;all the way to my neck.&#34; Patient has not taken any pain medications symptomatically. Patient reports feeling chills last night.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included pacemaker for nerve block (4-5 years ago), appendectomy (10 years ago), cataract surgery, and concurrent conditions included alcohol user (occasional, not often), and ex-smoker (used to smoke for 30 years (half pack a day), but quit 10 years ago) and bladder cancer growth (7 years ago). The patient experienced drug allergy with opioids (deathly ill, sick to stomach and passes out). The patient was not pregnant at the time of reporting.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805018, expiry: 25-MAY-2021) dose was not reported, 1 total, administered on right arm on 09-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination.

The patient had no high blood pressure. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from loss of fine motor control in right arm on 21-MAR-2021, and headache on 2021. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0 This report concerns a 76-year-old female patient who experienced headache and loss fine motor control in right arm, 8 and 12 days after receiving Jansen COVID-19 vaccine respectively. Patient&#39;s medical history included pacemaker insertion, ex-smoker, bladder cancer, and drug allergy with opioids. Eight days after vaccination, the patient had headache.

                                                78 year old woman admitted with severe back pain, inability to ambulate and leukocytosis on 3/31/21. History of hypertension, CHF, obesity, chronic kidney disease, and back pain. Work up included multiple consults. The patient was placed on SQ heparin for VTE prophylaxis. Acute L5 fracture was found along with emphysematous changes. Neurosurgical evaluation- no surgery was necessary. During the first 24 hours (before receiving the vaccine), the patient&#39;s Hg dropped 9.3 to 6.8 and platelets dropped 130K to 61 K with no apparent bleeding source.  PRBC transfusion was given. GI consult was obtained the patient was scheduled to have EGD the following morning (day 3). Cardiology was obtained for elevated troponin and hypoxia. An echo obtained on day 2 showed moderate elevated pulmonary artery pressure, mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and normal sized right atrium and ventricle. The patient received the Janssen vaccine upon request the morning of hospital day 2 (4.1.21 at 11:02). At 11:37PM on 4/1/21 the patient received 5mg IV metoprolol for elevated HR of 132 (BP 129/67). At 0128 on 4/2/21 the patient&#39;s heart rate dropped into the 60&#39;s and then declined further requiring cardiac resuscitation. The attempt was unsuccessful and the patient expired at 01:43 on 4/2/21. An autopsy was conducted (results available on 4/13/21) showed a 4 cm clot in the patient&#39;s right atrium and a mural thrombus in her femoral artery.

I had a headache and the muscle pains went into my left side and into my left lung and every time I breathed I would get a sharp pain. It went into both of my breasts but worse on left side of breast. This lasted about three or four days. I went to the doctor on Thursday, the 15th. But now everything is cleared up and I feel good. Yesterday, the 22nd I started feeling myself again. Except, I have a tremor that won&#39;t go away - I had a slight tremor before the vaccine but now after the tremor  it is much worse.

                                                Eleven days after getting the shot, my mother in law was experiencing severe back pain and was not able to get comfortable or sleep at night. Before we could take her to see a doctor, she fell while trying to get out of bed at 7am the next morning. She had trouble getting up and exerted a lot of energy trying on her own. She called for my husband and I to help her get up. I grabbed her around the waist and my husband held her walker for her as support. Upon rising (mostly of her own ability) she was so exhausted that we had her sit on her walker and rest a moment. My husband went to check on her twice over the next 15-20 minutes, but when he returned again she was showing classic stroke signs and EMS was called. They arrived quickly and agreed. She was taken immediately to the ER, where they also agreed that it looked like a stroke. She was admitted as they continued to run tests, but she continued to decline more and more each day at the hospital losing motor skills and ability to speak. She was not able to move her right side at all and the left side was fidgety and had uncontrollably flailing that left her bruises on her arm and leg. She was also excessively sleepy. After loads of testings and images, the MRIs finally showed that the brain stem was extremely inflamed and it was an auto-immune response. By this time, she was already a vegetable in the ICU ward under incubation, IVs and a feeding tube. They continued to run more tests and brought in infectious diseases, but they ultimately said her body was fighting an infection that she did not have. They attempted a hemoglobin treatment with an oncologist to shut down her immune system but never consulted with her renal doctor, even through they were very concerned about renal failure.  She could not complete the treatment and only received 4 out of the 5 doses they wanted to give her because of her kidney counts. They said that the auto-immune attack was very aggressive and they could not shut it down. In the early morning of 4/28/21, they finally contacted her kidney doctor and she was put on dialysis as a last effort to try to save her, but it was too late and all her organs were failing. She passed at 1:56 pm. Patient was homebound during the pandemic and did not leave the house unless she was visiting her doctor&#39;s office. My husband and I have limited contact at our jobs, as we work in small offices, and our children (that also lived with her) were being schooled virtually. There is nothing that I know that could have caused her immune system to go into overdrive, except for the vaccine that was administered less than 2 weeks (which is considered the time frame for vaccine immunity) prior to her symptoms.

At 5:30 PM I experienced muscle pain in my right lower thigh muscles right below my hip replacement scar that continued throughout the night. The next day the muscle pain was so sever I could not walk on my right leg and had to get down my walker from my surgery. The following day the pain was less severe. It has been 12 days now since the vaccination and my right thigh muscles are still sore but I can walk OK.

                                                My mom had a stroke on 6/17/2021 and was hospitalized. A week or so before the stroke, my mom lost feeling in the fingers of her right hand and didn?t feel well...but she didn?t feel sick, just not her normal self.  The stroke spidered out over both sides of her brain. Mom is off balance, her mouth droops on the right and that side of her face is numb. The doctors in hospital could see what happened to my mom but were puzzled why because she?s so healthy with no prior issues which would cause a stroke.  We saw mom?s primary care doctor after release from hospital. She was very surprised that mom had a stroke as nothing in blood work, her health or family history would indicate that this would happen. Doctor said it was probably the COVID-19 vaccine.

The next morning when she woke up she could not walk, had to hold onto something to walk, and has a lot of pain, and has not improved even with taking pain medications.  There has been no improvement from the pain.  There are times that she feels just a little better, but then returns back to where it was.  She went to the ER on 3/17/21, they said that she had arthritis which she had but she has not had this type of pain until the vaccination.  They gave her some pain medicine which did not help at all.  She again is taking some pain medication now but the pain is still there.  She can stand on her leg and it doesn&#39;t hurt, but when she moves her leg is when it hurts.  She is now using a walker which she did not have to use before the vaccine.

                                                Awoke 3rd day after vaccination with severe positional vertigo or similar disorder - felt when I simply turned my head on pillow.  It was as if I was falling in space, especially my head. Could  not sit up without feeling terrible. Lessened somewhat during day but could not move head without feeling vertigo/dizziness.  Unable to eat without nausea and vomiting.  That was 04/09/21. On 04/10 and 04/11 it was difficult to arise from bed without feeling very dizzy. But after getting up very slowly without moving head, I could move slowly to use  bathroom, get a little food, etc.  Today, 04/12, still had to arise from bed very slowly, trying not to move head to avoid weird dizzy type feeling.  Have been able to eat, get dressed and leave the house carefully. Try not to move head too much and move rather slowly.

                                                I received Botox on 2/19/21 In the right arm for post stroke treatment of muscle spasticity. Then I received the COVID-19 shot in the right arm on 3/12/21. Coincidentally within the following week, I developed extreme weakness in the right leg. It is severe enough that I&#39;m still having trouble walking at all even with help. So I&#39;m wondering if there was an interaction between the vaccine and the Botox that caused this. I&#39;ve had adverse interactions between medications before.

                                                I was walking in the airport and I just fell for no reason. I went down slow. I was able to get up on my own, but I have no idea what made me fall. I went to my daughter&#39;s house and I was trying to climb the stairs to get to her place, but I couldn&#39;t even bring my leg up to step on the first step. I had to physically pull myself up the stairs by my arms. I felt like I lost my strength. I lost control of my bladder. I went to the doctor to have a urinalysis done and there was not an infection. I also lost my balance and would often have chills. Anytime I would start walking it would feel like I was drunk with how I couldn&#39;t walk straight. I felt fatigued during this time as well. During time that I would try to speak, I would say something in a sentence that had nothing to do with the topic of conversation. I was thinking I may have had a stroke, but when I went to the doctor and had a CT scan, a brain MRI and blood work done, everything came back normal. All of this lasted three weeks and then just all went away. My doctor diagnosed me with post COVID viral illness, but I never had COVID. She said it&#39;s similar to a viral meningitis.

                                                A week following my mothers vaccination, she became increasing fatigued. On day 10 following her vaccination she went to bed and had to be helped to her room, this was unusual. She remained in bed for 19-20 hours a day for three days. I called all of her doctors, all of whom she had just been seen by, routine CT scans performed, blood work done, and visit with her neurologist. Her oncologist suggested we seek a hospice evaluation, even though her CT scans showed that her cancer had only slight growth, nothing to be concerned about. Her primary care office ordered the hospice evaluation and it was performed on Thursday, 3/18. They said ?she may just be having a bad week following her vaccination? and ?lets revisit this the following week?. her condition continued to deteriorate significantly over the next few days, so much that she began sleeping 21?23 hours a day. On the following Tuesday, 3/23, she was admitted into the hospice system. Now, four weeks later, we are in the final weeks of her life. She refuses food and water now, and her nurse says that it won?t be much longer. She went from a relatively healthily, senior woman, with underlying health issues, none of which presented her imminent demise, to dying at home within weeks of receiving her J&amp;J vaccine. I have no idea if he demise is in anyway related to her vaccine, but thought it was important to report her symptoms.
