                                                The patient is a 76 y.o. female who presents to the Emergency Department with three days of left ankle pain and swelling status post mechanical GLF. Patient reports that she fell onto her left side three days ago. She is not anticoagulated and denies striking her head or any LOC. Since then she has had constant dull left ankle pain which is acutely worsened with ROM and weight bearing. Patient reports a history of fracture to this ankle. Patient notes that she is able to shuffle when wearing her compression stocking, but this elicits pain. She has pain radiating up her LLE, into her buttocks, and up her back &#34;all the way to my neck.&#34; Patient has not taken any pain medications symptomatically. Patient reports feeling chills last night.

                                                78 year old woman admitted with severe back pain, inability to ambulate and leukocytosis on 3/31/21. History of hypertension, CHF, obesity, chronic kidney disease, and back pain. Work up included multiple consults. The patient was placed on SQ heparin for VTE prophylaxis. Acute L5 fracture was found along with emphysematous changes. Neurosurgical evaluation- no surgery was necessary. During the first 24 hours (before receiving the vaccine), the patient&#39;s Hg dropped 9.3 to 6.8 and platelets dropped 130K to 61 K with no apparent bleeding source.  PRBC transfusion was given. GI consult was obtained the patient was scheduled to have EGD the following morning (day 3). Cardiology was obtained for elevated troponin and hypoxia. An echo obtained on day 2 showed moderate elevated pulmonary artery pressure, mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and normal sized right atrium and ventricle. The patient received the Janssen vaccine upon request the morning of hospital day 2 (4.1.21 at 11:02). At 11:37PM on 4/1/21 the patient received 5mg IV metoprolol for elevated HR of 132 (BP 129/67). At 0128 on 4/2/21 the patient&#39;s heart rate dropped into the 60&#39;s and then declined further requiring cardiac resuscitation. The attempt was unsuccessful and the patient expired at 01:43 on 4/2/21. An autopsy was conducted (results available on 4/13/21) showed a 4 cm clot in the patient&#39;s right atrium and a mural thrombus in her femoral artery.

It went into both of my breasts but worse on left side of breast. This lasted about three or four days. I went to the doctor on Thursday, the 15th. But now everything is cleared up and I feel good. Yesterday, the 22nd I started feeling myself again. Except, I have a tremor that won&#39;t go away - I had a slight tremor before the vaccine but now after the tremor  it is much worse.

Patient states she has been on the ground in the room for 3 days, she was found covered in feces.  Alert and oriented x4 however intermittently appears confused and has varying history.  She does not know how she got on the ground, however denies fall or syncope.  No significant current complaints.  Slightly tachycardic and febrile, slightly hypertensive, exam without any significant acute findings, no obvious skin source of ulcer or infection, no focal neurological deficits, no pain.  Initiated aggressive fluid hydration and sepsis work-up.  EKG appears normal with no signs of ischemia or arrhythmia.  Labs show slightly elevated troponin, low magnesium, metabolic/lactic acidosis.  VBG relatively normal.  Urine negative for infection chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia, no clinical signs or symptoms to identify source of infection.  Nothing to suggest meningitis at this time.  CT head is negative.  Unclear source of fever however empirically treated with antibiotics and fluids.  Patient remains hemodynamically stable with no hypotension.  She did arrive slightly hypoxic and with increased respiratory rate however clear lung sounds and no indications of heart failure, COPD/asthma.  CT chest without evidence of pulmonary embolism, focal pneumonia, or fluid overload.  Respiratory status possibly related to compensation for metabolic acidosis that is likely due to lack of fluid intake due to being on the ground.  CK is normal and kidney function is normal.

She had left arm soreness over the subsequent days. After a week or two symptoms got worse with increased pain noted on 4/20/21.  Supportive care with analgesia was recommended by her primary care doctor. The pain in the left arm continued and the patient noted impaired range of motion  of the left shoulder with sensation of swelling in the arm  on 4/30/21. She was advised on shoulder exercises. There continued to be worsening pain and decreased range of motion of the left shoulder with notably impaired function. The patient also complained of ongoing tiredness and impaired sleep due to shoulder and arm pain.  She was assessed on 5/3/21 by her primary care doctor where exam showed swelling of the anterior left shoulder without erythema. There was severely impaired range of motion. She was diagnosed with frozen shoulder on the left. She was referred to orthopedic specialist and was seen on 5/4/21  where the diagnosis was confirmed along with impingement syndrome of the left shoulder. She received an intra-articular injection of steroid and was referred to physical therapy.  An MRI was recommended.

The next morning when she woke up she could not walk, had to hold onto something to walk, and has a lot of pain, and has not improved even with taking pain medications.  There has been no improvement from the pain.  There are times that she feels just a little better, but then returns back to where it was.  She went to the ER on 3/17/21, they said that she had arthritis which she had but she has not had this type of pain until the vaccination.  They gave her some pain medicine which did not help at all.  She again is taking some pain medication now but the pain is still there.  She can stand on her leg and it doesn&#39;t hurt, but when she moves her leg is when it hurts.  She is now using a walker which she did not have to use before the vaccine.

                                                Awoke 3rd day after vaccination with severe positional vertigo or similar disorder - felt when I simply turned my head on pillow.  It was as if I was falling in space, especially my head. Could  not sit up without feeling terrible. Lessened somewhat during day but could not move head without feeling vertigo/dizziness.  Unable to eat without nausea and vomiting.  That was 04/09/21. On 04/10 and 04/11 it was difficult to arise from bed without feeling very dizzy. But after getting up very slowly without moving head, I could move slowly to use  bathroom, get a little food, etc.  Today, 04/12, still had to arise from bed very slowly, trying not to move head to avoid weird dizzy type feeling.  Have been able to eat, get dressed and leave the house carefully. Try not to move head too much and move rather slowly.

Then I received the COVID-19 shot in the right arm on 3/12/21. Coincidentally within the following week, I developed extreme weakness in the right leg. It is severe enough that I&#39;m still having trouble walking at all even with help. So I&#39;m wondering if there was an interaction between the vaccine and the Botox that caused this. I&#39;ve had adverse interactions between medications before.

                                                A week following my mothers vaccination, she became increasing fatigued. On day 10 following her vaccination she went to bed and had to be helped to her room, this was unusual. She remained in bed for 19-20 hours a day for three days. I called all of her doctors, all of whom she had just been seen by, routine CT scans performed, blood work done, and visit with her neurologist. Her oncologist suggested we seek a hospice evaluation, even though her CT scans showed that her cancer had only slight growth, nothing to be concerned about. Her primary care office ordered the hospice evaluation and it was performed on Thursday, 3/18. They said ?she may just be having a bad week following her vaccination? and ?lets revisit this the following week?. her condition continued to deteriorate significantly over the next few days, so much that she began sleeping 21?23 hours a day. On the following Tuesday, 3/23, she was admitted into the hospice system. Now, four weeks later, we are in the final weeks of her life. She refuses food and water now, and her nurse says that it won?t be much longer. She went from a relatively healthily, senior woman, with underlying health issues, none of which presented her imminent demise, to dying at home within weeks of receiving her J&amp;J vaccine. I have no idea if he demise is in anyway related to her vaccine, but thought it was important to report her symptoms.
