As the day has gone on the dizziness has gotten worse. At times it feels like I?m going to faint. (I haven?t yet fainted)  I have not tried any treatment yet hoping it doesn?t last longer then today.

                                                5 hours after being given the shot, uncontrollable tremors began. Muscles began tensing up, tunnel vision started, extreme dizziness, vomiting, severe weakness in muscles, and fainting. These lasted for about 2 hours before decreasing in severity but continued to be present until about 10:30pm, 13 and a half hours after receiving the shot. Nothing was done to treat the symptoms. As of 12:30pm on 3/10, some minor symptoms are still present, such as muscle weakness and pain, severe migraine, and dizziness.

                                                Around 8 pm (about 6 hours after receiving the vaccine) I started to feel typical flu symptoms such as chills and aches, and I had some body shaking as well. I was in bed that night and the symptoms kept getting stronger, and around 11 pm I started to feel tingling throughout my body, mostly in my hands and feet. It was very uncomfortable to lay still and I felt I&#39;d never be able to fall asleep if I couldn&#39;t lay still. I took 10mg of Z-Quil around 11:30 pm. My body and skin was also starting to get very hot, I never took my  body temperature but I probably had a fever. I put a cold compress on my forehead. I also took 1000 mg acetaminophen and 400 mg Advil. I got up to use the bathroom and I could walk but my balance was off and I felt tingling up my legs. I laid back in bed with the cold compress again and the tingling in my hands and feet increased. I tried walking around again and again felt tingling up my legs. I sat on the edge of my bed moving my feet around which helped the tingling, but when I laid down again the tingling kept coming back. I took another 10mg of Z-Quil and 0.25mg xanax (prescription for anxiety). I finally decided to move to a chair with lots of pillows so I could sit upright since that helped reduce the tingling. I finally fell asleep sometime after 12:30 am. I woke up in the chair around 2 am and was feeling better - no tingling, no body shaking, chills and aches were reduced and body temperature didn&#39;t feel as high. I was then able to sleep in bed for the rest of the night. The next day I still had aches and chills and a fever but it was manageable with Advil or acetaminophen, and by Monday (March 8) I was able to go to work.

                                                Hi, I received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine one week ago, Thurs March 11. On friday, I experienced the typical flu like symptoms - chills aches pains and fever. These have slowly gone away, but a week later I still have chills and constantly shake, and diarrhea. The most significant side effect I want to report is extreme vertigo and dizziness and headaches. These have been present for a week now and have prevented me from working and doing daily activities. I constantly feel like Im going to fall over and cannot see clearly. I previously had vestibular migraines, but these have been mostly gone due to going to the chiropractor and taking my supplements. The vaccine brought them back now in full force. I read that this is becoming a commonality among other people and need answers on this. I want to make sure its not permanent or that I will have this as a serious side effect.

About 5 pm, I started to feel really cold and my whole body was shivering and vibrating. My whole body also started to ache and my bones felt heavy. At about 10 pm I started to get really high fever and felt so cold. I could not sleep even with a winter jacket on, I had a really bad headache in the center of my forehead, lower back pain and felt extremely sore and weak. I found it difficult to stand or walk. I woke up at 2:30 am from bed, to get a snack and took 2 ibuprofen to ease the symptoms. Woke up at about 10 am next day, felt slightly better. Fever has gone down slightly but not completely. Still feeling really cold and shivering.

                                                I started to lose mobility in my left arm the evening of my vaccine appointment. The following morning, I could not raise my arm at all. The pain in my upper left arm (where the vaccine was administered) has been severe for more than 48 hours. It is extremely painful to the touch. I can use my left hand, but cannot function/cannot perform necessary daily work and school tasks due to the loss of mobility. I have been in extreme pain and fear my shoulder has been injured.

Her dizziness became worse and I got the Epi Pen ready.   A few minutes later, she asked to lie down due to her dizziness.   I assisted her and had my tech call 911.   She had no trouble breathing but did develop tingling in her hands and a blotchy red rash on her chest.  The paramedics arrived and checked her vitals which they said were fine.  They took her out to the ambulance as a precaution.

                                                Patient began with nausea and walked to the restroom because she felt she may throw up.  She returned to the post-vaccine administration monitoring area after about two minutes to sit down again.  At that time, I asked more questions about symptoms.  She was also feeling weak and like she may pass out.  I gave her a cold compress to place on her neck which improved her symptoms very rapidly.  She remained in the area with the cold compress for about 10 more minutes before she felt well and she then left with her husband.

She asked if it was normal that her arm hurt really bad, then she stated she was getting dizzy and light headed. I instructed her to sit on the floor so she would not fall down. She sat on the floor and immediately passed out. She remained unconscious for 60- 90 seconds. We laid her into the prone position. Her arms were twitching. She regained consciousness. 911 was alerted and responded. Pt refused to leave with them. She sat with un an additional 15 minutes before she left for a therapy appointment.

                                                Experienced light headedness ( started before time stated but not sure when exactly). Around 6:30pm-7pm I began feeling dizzy, going between dizzy and light headed. I was drinking plenty fluids and did eat. A few people noted that I looked very out of it, and I felt very out of it. I tried staying seated and this did not have any effect on the dizzy feeling. I went to lay down and before going to sleep around 10pm-11pm, laying in bed I felt like the room was spinning. I also had typical symptoms, soreness as injections site and arm (starting immediately the day of vaccine), fever at it&#39;s highest was 102 (starting at 100.5 that morning, not peaking until Motrin wore off*see below*), feeling tired and very heavy.. like everywhere was waited down by something (starting early in the morning).  I was given Motrin by my coworker in the morning as I was had a headache  and was feeling sore and moving sore due to heavy feeling. Wednesday waking up the dizziness  and lightheadedness were gone. A slight feeling of being out of it however, fever was about 99-100 throughout the day (99 being my typical temp). As of today only a feeling of sore arm and tiredness which sometimes feels like I and out of it but I feel both from later yesterday and today is due to the tired feeling that comes common.

                                                About 12 hours after injection, I started feeling achey 13 hours later, I had a spell where I could not hear anything and felt as if I wasn?t in control of my body- in talking to medical personnel they say what I?m describing is what happens right before one passes out. I came out of it within 10 minutes. 16 hours later I had a 102 fever. Took Tylenol Felt fine 24 hours later 32 hours later I started to get a headache and light sensitivity. Fever back to over 99- low grade for me.  35 hours later I had such a bad headache and light sensitivity. I couldn?t watch tv, be on my phone, or look at a computer screen. I also started to get bouts of nausea. 38 hours later, I vomited for the first time. Same symptoms as what I described last. 42 hours later, I vomited again. 48 hours later - 5 days later, light sensitivity and  migraine symptoms continued , but improved slowly each day.               6 days later, all previous symptoms were gone. I woke up with a bump in my inner eye. Slowly went away throughout the day, then developed a itchy, red bump in between my lips and nose, that progressively got bigger throughout the day and made my lip swell. Bump was about 2 inches in diameter at its biggest. Took Claritin, cleaned face with alcohol, and by 24 hours later it was not noticeable.  8 days later, the bump appeared again in between lip and nose on the opposite side of my face.  Took Benadryl, bump slowly went down throughout the day. By 24 hours later it was gone

                                                Had no side effects whatsoever for many hours. Felt completely fine until about 7:30 pm, while I was making my plate of dinner. Felt lightheaded, dizzy, and hot. I began to black out, so I sat down, which helped for a few moments to subside lightheadedness. I was still feeling hot, so I walked a few feet to my back door and sat down on the steps outside to cool off. Within minutes, my vision blurred completely, I saw stars, and completely blacked out. My mother, who was nearby, heard me fall on the steps. She said my eyes rolled back, my body was completely limp, I was not breathing but rather making gurgling noises from my throat. She propped my head up, which allowed me to breathe properly, and I came to.   If my mother had not been nearby, I am convinced I would be dead right now. I saw the light, saw the other side, saw my relatives. I have had a near death experience once before, and this was exactly like that.

                                                Within 2 hours of getting the vaccine, I developed a severe migraine, fever(100.1-100.4), chills, dizziness, extreme body aches, nausea and was very weak. Once the bulk of the symptoms subsided, a little under 48 hours after the vaccine was administered, I was able to resume to my daily life. I still have a lingering migraine, arm pain, body aches and a low grade fever of 99.9 now almost 72 hours later, but it is bearable unlike the immediate 48 hours following the vaccine. Over-the-counter medications usually take the edge off of my migraines, though they didn?t even come close to helping the one I currently have. I have been rotating Tylenol and ibuprofen since developing the side effects.

I also experienced an intense stomach pain that came and went that would make it difficult to move without severe pain. I felt extremely disoriented and confused and had a strong headache throughout the intense period of symptoms. Around 7 AM on April 9th the next day, the symptom&#39;s severity decreased and I experienced all of the symptoms mildly along with drowsiness. On april 10th I did not experience any stomach pain, body aches, or chills but, still experienced drowsiness, intermittent headaches and a mild fever. On april 11th, drowsiness  and a headache continued. Today, april 12th, I am still experiencing a mild headache and slight drowsiness.

I had taken both Adderall and Allegra that day. 4 days after receiving the vaccine, I took Adderall and Allegra and had an adverse reaction (I hadn&#39;t taken Adderall the prior 3 days). I experienced palpitations and vertigo/dizziness plus slight nausea. The next day, I took a much lower dose of Adderall and decided to continue taking approximately 1/3rd of my typical dose after an E-visit with my primary care Dr. During the week of 4/5, I was able to increase the dose by a little bit without any adverse reactions. Starting on 4/11, I was able to take 2/3rds of the typical dose without adverse reaction. However, I am still experiencing vertigo/dizziness, which may or may not be sinus-related due to seasonal allergies.

Went for a light walk in the morning. Completely lost vision in both eyes extremely blurry. Stumbled my way home running into trees, cars. Vision came back, thought it was migraine (had them before but nowhere NEAR as bad, never had vision completely blocked)  Excurtating headache behind eyes and nausea, feels like pressure in head. Worst headache of my life, went to ER. Gave morphine (did not help pain at all which was horrifying) got a head CT scan which came out clear and discharged because clotting ruled out. It is now day 6 and my headache is persistent and still excruciatingly painful. I?m also extremely nauseous. I?m terrified because I know something is very wrong. ER doc said might be lingering side effect from vaccine but those effects felt very different.

                                                Tight right chest. Severe leg pain. I never have had this type of leg pain before.  It?s painful in joint section that I have to walk slow.  I am unable to walk up on staircase more than 3 floors. I don?t know what is going on but this never happened before and the fact that I got  shot recently made me worried. I am young still, used to walk a lot and also did hiking. I never had troubles with my leg joint until recently.

                                                I woke up at 3 am Friday with cold sweats and body aches. Took 1000 mg Tylenol. Woke up again at 10:30 am to a fever still and this odd extremity feeling. Felt like I had a compression body suit on and weight of 50 pounds around my arms and legs, Mild shortness of breath. I felt like I was swollen but did not see any. I called my PCP and vaccine line and both nurses said go to the ER. I went to the ER they ran tests. The time of the ER I started getting leg cramping and spasming. Those symptoms continued to the weekend. On Sunday the weight and swelling feeling went away. I still had bad muscle cramping and swelling. I did telehealth on Tuesday with PCP and was given muscle relaxer which helped some throughout the rest of the week. Thursday night I have a temp pf 99.6 and went up to 100.6 on Friday morning. On Friday I became shortness of breath and fatigued. It became difficult to go up and down stairs or walking about 20 ft without difficulty breathing. I now have a lower right leg muscle twitch/spasm that comes and goes. I switched to a different PCP, he ran more blood work on Wednesday 4/21. And discussed the next steps for treatment and monitoring.

                                                The first 2 days had awful headache and muscle aches, could not leave the bed. Then a week later, I got a horrible rash all of my body, worse at my hands and feet. The rash included many blisters. Loss of appetite and cannot sleep. I still have the rash now, and it is even getting worse in some parts, while other parts are better due to a steroid cream prescribed by my dermatologist.  On April 26, I felt very dizzy and weak and went to urgent care. I have since recovered from those symptoms.

                                                At 3 am the night of the vaccine, I woke up with flu like symptoms, including a headache and shortness of breath. Two days later, I had a severe manic episode that lasted for three days (bipolar was well managed with medication at this point and I had not had a manic episode in months). Along with the manic episode, I developed chest pressure and shortness of breath, along with dizziness and a pounding sensation in my chest.  Any physical activity or even a sip of coffee sets my heart off. I am still experiencing these symptoms to this day and caused me to lose my job because I am not able to perform the required tasks. I had a premature atrial contraction prior to the COVID vaccine, but it had cleared up and I had been off of the medication for months with no problems.  I have been to the doctor&#39;s office (primary care physician-4/15/21 and 4/20/21) twice, the emergency room once (4/26/21), urgent care (4/14/21), and now am seeing a cardiologist for this condition (first visit 4/29/21).

The pharmacist/doctors at CVS gave me some water and told me to elevate ny legs. After 10 minutes they checked my termperature and blood pressure. I stabized somewhat and when home. I was sure it it was my nerves but something did feel right. I had a slight burning in my chest and felt queezy on/off throughout the day. Chills and hot flashes followed. I was anxious and paranoid about the possibility something serious coukd be wrong with me. I felt shooting pains in my lower left abdomen that nught and the next day. The following day I still felt very weak. My arm hurt. My muscles felt like jello and I?m unhappy. I wish I never got the shot and I?m worried about my body?s reaction to it.

I got out of bed and fainted on the floor. Laid there for a few moments. Got water. Laid back into bed and my body completely locked up. It felt like there were pins and needles coursing through my entire body. I couldn?t bend or move my legs. My wrists were bent down and my fingers all locked together. I could not move them at all. I was screaming out in pain. It was the worst pain I?ve ever felt. My roommate called 911. Paramedics arrived and took my temperature and blood pressure. They tried calming me down. eventually I did. And my fingers and legs unlocked but I continued having a severe headache, back pain, muscle aches and nausea. I woke up every hour of the night and threw up several times.  It?s been 24 hours after the shot and I am still having headaches fatigue and muscle spasms.

Saw black dots, pain spread from arm to chest, got up to let the pharmacist know woke up on the floor shaking, head felt like it was bleeding but I didn?t hit me head.  Saw black spots and waves of blur in my vision for hours.  Meds came decided to observe at home.  Did NOT have anxiety.  I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks I am well aware of the feelings, coping techniques etc that come with them.   Now I have major anxiety that I got a injected with some that may hurt me.

I called Urgent care first but they sent me to ER. Dizzy - still but they still sent me home. I was off and on dizzy for about a week. The brain fog improved throughout the week - Monday was the worst day but it was progressively getting better by the next Monday.

We evaluated her pulse, blood pressure, and respirations which were all normal.  She laid down with her feet raised for about 10 minutes before the paramedics arrived and she left with them for further evaluation.

                                                During injection, felt pins and needles from injection site to fingertips which faded to tingling and stopped entirely after about 7 minutes.   Intense nausea and sweating beginning 1-2 minutes post injection; unable to sit up. Lasted approximately 7-10 minutes before clearing up  2 hours later (7:10 pm), arm at and above injection site felt hot to the touch and had mild dull pain at every movement. Slightly dizzy and nauseous. Arm periodically ached without movement.  By 7:26 pm, arm pain from movement was a sharp pain, though still pretty mild.  Around 9:30 pm, gently pressed at site of injection and a jolt of pain went all the way down to my fingers  Nausea increased at 10:13, still mild. Decided to go to sleep. Woke up at least 5 times before 12:30 am in various states of pain and discomfort, including nausea when attempting to sit up; dry throat/mouth; pins and needles throughout my glutes and thighs accompanied by pain in my left hip, knee, ankle, and jaw; and mild to moderate arm pain at the injection site. Took about 15 minutes to be able to get up due to nausea and got some water.  Was cold so wrapped myself in a blanket. Nausea and arm pain with movement remained but I was able to go back to sleep around 1:15 am.  Woke up at 2:53 am - arm pain minimal and nausea gone, blanket felt nice but unnecessary, went back to sleep  Woke up at 5:34 am with pins and needles  in glutes and thighs and pain in my right jaw, knee, hip, and ankle (all sites of previous moderate injuries) along with a low grade headache. Went back to sleep.  Woke up after an hour or so feeling relatively normal, arm pain and headache returned after sitting up. Got out of bed but ended up taking another nap.  Woke up after another hour with just a headache and brain feeling fuzzy, but strong tingles began returning to my glutes and thighs  like they had fallen asleep (referred after this point as tingles). Arm hurt. Drank some more water and took another nap.  Woke up around 9:15 am with a low grade headache and slight tingles; fuzzy brain feeling was gone. Legs wobbly when I walked. Realized that tingling got worse anytime I was sitting down or lying on my back.  Around 10:20 am started crying - no known cause. Couldn&#39;t stop for a few minutes. This is not normal for me.  Around 1 pm realized I had a pretty high fever; unsure how high it was or how long I&#39;d had it. Took another nap at 1:30 pm and woke up at 2:20 pm feeling much less hot so I thought it had broken, but I was told by my friend who dropped by that I was still feverish just much lower.  Slept from about 2:45-3:55 pm; headache was much better when I awoke; tingles and sore arm remained.  Realized at 4:13 pm that I&#39;d had no appetite the whole day. I&#39;d also barely been able to force myself to drink water; too cold and it hurt, room temperature didn&#39;t feel right.  No times, but felt periodic stabbing pain in my left ear until about 6:30 pm.  Much else also recovered by 6:30 pm: felt well enough to drink cold stuff, tingles were low grade, fever was present but low. Arm was still sore.  7:08 pm headache was gone.  8:49 pm felt much better and able to do things and take care of myself with minimal discomfort, but felt a little lousy overall - low grade headache, head felt like there was some pressure in it, periodic tingles, achy arm.  9:29 pm felt exhausted and slightly achy but otherwise mostly normal. Felt some hunger twinges for the first time that day but nothing felt appealing (realized I had only eaten about 5 spoonfuls of soup the whole day). Fell asleep getting ready for bed; woke up at 10:49 pm and finished getting ready for bed then went back to sleep.  Summary: Friday: Symptoms: mild to moderate nausea, mild dizziness, mild to moderate injection site pain, pins and needles in glutes and thighs, joint pain  Treatment: drinking water  Saturday:  Symptoms: mild to moderate pain at injection site, headache, fever, nausea, tiredness, glute and thigh tingles, lack of appetite, periodic stabbing pain in left ear  Treatments: ice/cold pack on arm (helped with arm pain while on), drinking water, sleeping

                                                My shot hurt very bad, and my IMMEDIATE reaction was ?wow she shot me really high on my shoulder?. Thought that was strange, but didn?t think anything of it. Pain increased daily, and 3 weeks after my vaccine (after taking advil/tylenol daily) I was in such excruciating level 10 pain that I was losing sleep at night. I then found out about SIRVA from a friend, and after doing some reading, I was sure that?s what it was. I went to urgent care, and they knew nothing about it. They gave me muscle relaxers that didn?t do anything. I woke up a few days later with such intense throbbing/sharp pain that I was unable to move my arm/shoulder above my elbow. I went to the emergency room with a friend because I couldn?t even drive, and they also didn?t know what SIRVA was. They gave me oral steroid medication &amp; an orthopedic referral for it it got worse. The meds helped a little, brought my pain down to a 6/7. Once the meds were complete, my pain increased, so I went to the ortho, who KNEW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT, and diagnosed me with SIRVA after doing an x-ray. He told me to let him know how it was feeling a week later, since the steroids did help a bit. Unfortunately, the pain only got worse, so I went back in for a cortisone shot. That helped more than anything, and my pain is now down to a 2/3. I have been trying out some PT, but am honestly reading some crazy stories about chronic pain online that are scaring me and am afraid I will never have my arm at 100% again. The reason I am bothering with this form, is because I would love to be considered for any compensation for the nearly 3 grand in medical bills sitting on my desk. Of course on top of it, my last day at my last job was 3/31 (few days before getting vaccinated) and I just got a new job this week. These past few months have been a really really stressful time period, and I?m super angry that it?s just because I got vaccinated. Sorry for the rambling, but I really hope they raise awareness of this and alert untrained health care workers of the possibility, so that no one has to go through this again.

                                                Fever started at around 4:30 am the morning after receiving the vaccine. The chills woke me up, so I took Tylenol 1000 mg and my fever broke about an hour later. I had to keep taking Tylenol 1000 mg at 10:30 am and 4:30 pm to control my fever. Each dose worked well for the first 3 hours or so on the fever, but then it would come back. I also had muscle and headaches and fatigue, which made it very difficult to move around. The Tylenol also helped with that somewhat, but I spent most of the day in bed and on the couch (and I am normally very active). By around 5:30-6pm, the symptoms were fading slowly. I felt a lot less achy and my body temperature felt closer to regular by the time I went to bed at 9pm.

                                                I noticed a very mild headache and slight coldness within 2 hours of my vaccine.  Onset of my severe symptoms began around 10PM on 03/12/2021 with a stabbing headache (Felt like someone took an air pump and kept &#39;blowing up&#39; my head. My eyes felt achy and heavy and every time I looked in a different direction I would get a zapping/electric feeling throughout my head that would cause my head and neck to spasm (longer duration) or twitch (quick jolt). This also caused dizziness). I got really cold and had intense shivering and shaking. Around midnight, my skin started feeling bruised all over my body (very sensitive to touch, including my bed sheets against my spine felt like rubbing up against a wound). At the same time, my joints (especially my neck, hips, and knees) got hot to the touch and were incredibly painful (induced tears). My muscles developed a deep ache that also caused significant pain. I felt very weak and confused. I didn&#39;t take my temperature until the early morning, and it was 102.9 at that time. I alternated taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen throughout the day, but my temperature stayed between 102 and 103.1 for about 24 hours, as did the previously noted symptoms.   I noticed a gradual improvement of my symptoms over the next two days. On the evening of 03/14/2021, my headache worsened some, and I had an unexpected episode where I nearly passed out (dropped to the floor but stayed conscious). I also had intermittent foot tingling (very noticeable, not mild) over the course of a few hours.   For 3 full days (but by far the most severe within the first 24 hours), I experienced some strange sound processing. Things like the sound of a car driving by or the ceiling fan felt like it echoed throughout my whole body and gave me an uncomfortable shivering feeling.   As of today (03/16/2021), I am mostly recovered. I am still experiencing fatigue, a very mild headache, and some mild pain. My nausea has completely resolved, though that was never a chief complaint of mine.   I realize that some of my symptoms are to be expected with this vaccine. But especially the level of pain I experienced throughout my entire body was very concerning and not something that I was aware could happen as a result of the vaccine.

Dizziness worsened over the evening to the point where almost any movement made me dizzy. Extreme muscle and body aches around 8pm continuing now. Feeling very weak and had chills throughout the night. These symptoms feel exactly how I felt when I had covid on 12/28/20.

                                                Injection technique seemed poor as it was the most painful vaccination I&#39;ve ever received, and upper arm became tight and achy immediately. Soreness lingered but the sharper pain went away shortly after. About 8-10 hours later I began feeling nauseous and lightheaded. 12 hours after vaccine I had trouble falling asleep, overcome with nausea and chills.  This turns into sweating and insomnia the rest of the night. The following day I felt better, but the next night (and following one) I continued feeling a bit sick. Currently (3 days later) my upper arm is still very sore and I have lots of muscle/joint aches throughout my whole body.

Throughout the night my body became extremely sensitive and sore especially in my lower back and neck. My temperature also continued to rise to 103.0.  Throughout the day of 4/9/21 I was taking Tylenol and ibuprofen on a rotating schedule. My temperature went up and down throughout the day spiking at 105.7 and dropping down to 101.2. Around 10:00 PM it was around 102.9 and my body was becoming even weaker. This morning, now 36 hours after my symptoms started, I can barely lift my arm, my headache has worsened, my total soreness and weakness is no better and my temperature is 102.3.  I have also had trouble with staying hydrated because my skin hurts if it is not covered from the air and I get heavy chills,  but when I cover up I am profusely sweating constantly. The sweat is so bad, I constantly have to lay on a towel and change my clothes.

                                                Was administered covid vaccine J&amp;J  on left arm felt a burning sensation just after it which i knew it normal you just got a vaccine. Walked to the observatory area where we are supposed to wait 15min until you are released to go. Well less than 10 min in the observation area that?s when i started to feel un well my body started sweating excessively and thats when i felt numbness on my right side of my head with a tingling sensation couldn?t hear with my right ear and i freaked out when i started to get blurred vision thats when i knew something was wrong i got up to ask for water once i got up i felt like i was going to faint and felt really dizzy. Once i got to the lady that was there in the observation area  she was shocked at how i looked she told me to go sit down and brought me water as she called the ambulance. Once i was sitting down and was brought water i drank like more than half of the water and the numbness was going down from my right side of my head but still had blurred vision and just felt disoriented and not my self. The ambulance took me to the ER once i got there i felt a little better but still disoriented and dizzy. So disoriented that i left the hospital with me actually realizing i had to stay there to get checked because they kept saying i was fine.

Around approximately 8pm I was feeling very feverish, experiencing body aches, mental fog, intense shaking and chills,  and within the next few hours threw up multiple times. I eventually fell asleep and sweated profusely, waking up multiple times (unusual for me). The next day I had low appetite, fatigue, and body aches, but other symptoms were reduced.

                                                After feeling better from the expected symptoms of the vaccine I experienced intermittent nausea and a few instances of dizziness. These events would happen about 3 times per day lasting from an hour to two hours for about 3 weeks after my vaccine. The bouts were the worst the first 2 weeks after vaccination and have finally now begun to subside about 5 weeks after. I have never experienced nausea without any other symptoms before in my life. I honestly thought I could be pregnant but I have had 2 periods since vaccination so it definitely was not that.

Sunday was dizziness, aches, nausea and cramping in left leg. Monday was nausea, aches, tingling in hands and feet, headache, brain fog. Tuesday I woke up with major imbalance and needed to use walls to walk without falling over. Dizziness subsided after some time to only rapid movements. I had a warm burning sensation in left leg with tingling hands and feet. Moderate headache. Reports came out of stopping the Janssen vaccine so I contacted my doctor with my symptoms and they ordered blood tests for clots.

She did not tell staff ahead of time that she passes out with vaccines and was sitting in her chair at the time of administration.  Pt sts she immediately got lightheaded and dizzy and she passed out before she even knew what happened.  Pt did fall out of her chair and hit her head on the floor.  She was responsive within 10 seconds per bystanders and was AOX4. She does have a small amount of swelling to an approximate 1&#34; hematoma to the R side of her head just into her hairline. She was treated and released by EMSA.  She refused transport to the hospital.  She did have pain at the site of the hematoma.  PMS was intact X4 and her neuro function was intact per EMSA during exam.  Pt left POV.

As of 4/15 hard lump remains at injection site. 4/6- 12:15pm hives, redness, itching, burning on sides of upper thighs, buttocks, within 2 hours hives spread to backs of arms, all the way down legs. Went to quick care facility at 2:30pm. Waited in waiting room until 3:50pm checked legs with doctor at 4:00pm and little red dots appeared in random clusters down both legs. Doctor assumed folliculitis, prescribed Cephalexin. 5:00pm took 50mg Benadryl while waiting for prescription. Picked up antibiotic around 6:30pm. When I got home around 7:00pm both legs were burning. Discovered huge painful red patches all over both legs. 10:00pm took 50mg Benadryl again. Went to bed 4/7- 9:00am red patches still painful, burning. Took 50mg more Benadryl. Spent most of the day sleeping 4/8- hives gone due to benadryl. Red patches slightly less painful. New red patches/dots appeared on ankles and tops of feet 4/9- red dots spread over tops of feet/toes, new itchy bumps with red dots appeared trailing down the backs of calf area on both legs. 8:30am went back to quick care facility. Saw new doctor who instructed to stop taking antibiotic and switch to cream form of &#34;triamcinolone 0.1%&#34; twice daily. Also referred to dermatology specialist. 3:30pm first application of steroid cream made legs burn and feet/ankles swell. Determined too much was used 4/10-4/13 smaller amount of cream applied twice daily as directed. Burning stopped but feet/ankles still swollen each day 4/13-original large red patches mostly cleared. New red dots on backs of calves and tops of feet still prevalent. 4:00pm saw dermatology specialist who determined red dots were a form of vasculitis. Ordered blood and urine analysis to determine if other organs have been affected. Scheduled appointment with laboratory for 4/17 at 11:00am Other symptoms: dizziness, abdominal pain/pressure, diarrhea at various points throughout the day from 4/9-current

                                                Patient received Janssen COVID19 vaccine at 10:15am. Upon receiving vaccine she sat down on chair to wait for 15 minutes post-vaccination. Just minutes after sitting down patient lost consciousness, fell from chair, hit her head on the floor, seize for a short moment, only to momentarily regain consciousness,  and faint for a second time.  EMS were called and patient was transported to Emergency Department for testing and observation. Patient believes she fainted the first time due to not having eaten much by that point in the day and due to anxiety about receiving the vaccine, and she was told she fainted a second time due to hypotension. She states she has a history of previously fainting during other medical procedures, though no similar previous reactions she can recall after vaccines.

By the 12 hour mark I had a 103.9 fever, chills, severe body aches, nausea, weakness, fatigue, and dizziness. Treated with Tylenol and Advil over the next 24 hours. Fever, aches and chills subsided within 48 hours. Weakness and fatigue lasted for 7 days after vaccination, then went away. General dizziness (constantly feels like when you have a cold/ear infection and get up and are dizzy) persists through date of this report (day 12 after vaccination). I feel completely better except for the dizziness.

                                                On 03/18/2021 at 03:30AM I had a lot of arm pain from my shoulder to my elbow in my left arm. This lasted until 03/31/2021.  On 03/18/2021 I woke up with a headache that would not go away. Next, at about 03:15PM I was not able to walk for about 10 minutes. Then, at about 05:00PM I started menstruating. At 07:00PM I had severe pain in my pelvic area for an hour and a half. At approximately 08:30PM I passed a softball sized blood clot vaginally.  I bled heavily through the night.  On 03/19/2021 I still had a headache and no energy at all. I continued to bleed heavily all day as well. 03/20/2021 was the exact same as the days prior. 03/21/2021 I was still bleeding heavily throughout the day with no energy. I still had the headache as well. I started feeling dizzy while walking on this day.  03/22/2021 I went to work like normal. I was cold all day. I was still bleeding, headache and dizziness. It was hard to stand for 30 minutes. While climbing the stairs I got very light headed and dizzy. I could not go up the stairs at a normal pace. 03/23/2021 I had the same symptoms all day but I was getting short of breath walking short distances. I still had very little energy and a headache. I also lost all color in my face and hands. I was still cold all day. I noticed some slight swelling in my ankles.  03/24/2021 The symptoms were getting more intense. I was still cold.  I finally took some aspirin for the headache because it was very severe. The medication didn&#39;t help with it. This routine went on for the next week and the symptoms intensified with each day. Throughout this time I was still passing clots that ranged in size from golf/ping pong ball to baseballs. They were very painful when they passed.  The days from 03/25/2021 to 04/01/2021 were all the same as far as how I felt.  On 04/02/2021 I woke up with the same symptoms but now I could not stay awake for anything. I slept on and off all day. I only ate one meal a day because I was so tired and I had no appetite. The headache was getting worse as the days went on. The bleeding was still happening. It was not as heavy as the weeks before, but enough to be painful still. I also started having abdominal pain.  On 04/03/2021 I was seeing stars when I moved too quickly. My heart rate was elevated with shortness of breath along with the rest of the previous symptoms. My headache however was very intense.  04/04/2021 I still couldn&#39;t stay awake on top of all the other symptoms. The dizziness and stars were more frequent. I couldn&#39;t move my head without seeing stars.  04/05/2021 I couldn&#39;t get warm and I still felt the same way. I called and made a doctor?s appointment for Wednesday the 7th. I had all the same symptoms still and they were getting worse. I had to move in slow motion so I could try to function.  04/06/2021 I woke up drained of all my energy and color. I couldn&#39;t shower because of the pain in my body. I couldn&#39;t stand because I felt like I was going to fall down. I could barely stand up straight let alone walk very far. I was shaking from being so cold. I had all the same symptoms from the days prior. I was in severe pain. I couldn&#39;t sit because of the pain in my abdomen I couldn&#39;t stand because of the weakness in my legs. I could barely see anything because of the stars I was seeing. At this point I had no color and I was barely conscious. That is when my family took me to the emergency room.

                                                After the shot I had a pasta lunch and then took a nap for about one hour.  When I woke up ( 3-4 hours after the shot) I had a fever.  I could tell because I was very hot and sweaty even though my room was air conditioned.  I drank water and immediately was nauseous and vomited.  I continued to have sweats, chills, and after about another hour body aches set in.  My whole body was cramping up and my hands were shaky.  I was very short of breath over short movements like to get to the bathroom, I would be out of breath and dizzy.   Around 1700  (6 hours post shot) I took Tylenol and continued to take it every six hours.  I was able to keep ginger ale and crackers down but didn&#39;t eat much else until the next morning.  I think the fever broke in the night.  The next morning I was just really tired and sore, but much less achy than the day prior.   I was able to eat light meals  and I stopped taking Tylenol sometime that mid-morning.  I felt fine the next day (about 48 hours after the shot).

I had bloody stool. On Saturday 4/24 I was still experiencing body and head pains and continued having bloody stool and by around midnight I had abdominal pains and went to the ER. My appetite was poor the prior week, and since this incident I have hardly been able to eat. I am constantly nauseous and dizzy. After days of not being able to eat, I ate some soup and vomited it back up. I still have abdominal pain, nausea, and am fatigued with a less intense headache.

I then started to sweat profusely from every inch of my skin. I couldn?t catch my breath. I was handed water and told to sip on it, which proved difficult when my throat started to feel like it was swelling up. After about a 15 minute ordeal, it was like nothing ever happened. The only symptom that remained, was sweat soaked clothes

                                                Around seven hours after receiving the vaccination I was very fatigued. Nine hours post vaccine I had chills and a fever. Upon waking up the next morning I was nauseas, had a mild headache, a fever and chills, and very sore and stiff joints. Tylenol has been helping with the fever and the joint pain.

                                                Patient administered Janssen vaccine on 5/5/21 at 1011AM by pharmacist on duty. Patient did not admit any anxiety surrounding vaccine during counseling prior to receiving the vaccine. After administration patient mentioned she has can get anxious sometimes and has tendency to create symptoms in her head. She asked what to be on the look out for for signs of syncope and described starting to feel nauseous, clamy, and tunnel vision. Within seconds she briefly lost consciousness and started to slump in chair within immunization room. Pharmacist prevented her from falling out of chair while opening door to waiting room and asked for assistance from patients boyfriend. Together we held patient in place on chair and propped feet up on another chair. Immediately patient regained consciousness enough to explain what she was feeling but then quickly lost consciousness again and started snoring as if she immediately fell asleep. Boyfriend said no history of sleep issues/narcolepsy, together we laid patient on floor of immunization room with feet slightly elevated and boyfriend at her head and again she immediately regained consciousness. Patient explained that she was immediately starting to feel better and felt dizzy and described having very odd dream like scenarios. She laid on floor for 10 min, Alert and orientedx4, moved to seated position for another 10 min, accepted offer for apple juice, moved to waiting area to sit for another 10min before OK leaving. MOD/PDM aware....Called patient at 6pm that same evening and patient reported feeling great.

                                                On Thursday morning I noticed a pain where my ear meets my jaw and as the day went on it became more severe, to the point I couldn&#39;t open my mouth to eat. The next day my ear was in pain, felt full, started to get swollen, couldn&#39;t hear very well out of it. The following day I lost all hearing out of it, it became even more swollen, has been throbbing, can&#39;t even see inside my ear. I went to a Clinic on Saturday, the 15th, and they diagnosed me with an ear infection. After 3 doses of an antibiotic, 3 doses of prescribed ear drops, and several days worth of ibuprofen the swelling has only gotten worse with terrible pain.

My joints have swollen to 3 times the normal size and it has gotten to the point I can barely walk and I am In excruciating pain. My right knee looks like it is dislocated it?s so swollen and I can barely walk. The only option is to get a cortisone shot which is extremely damaging to the body. I am In perfect health otherwise and have never had any health issues prior to getting the vaccine. It is getting so painful I can not workout, go up or down stairs and feel like my leg is going to give out when I walk

                                                Immediately after the vaccine I had extreme sleepiness and some dizziness. After taking a nap I felt better for a few hours. I did notice my Raynaud?s symptoms became way worse.  At about 5:30pm I started to feel extremely cold. By 6pm I was having horrible pains and spasms in my lower back and hips. My muscles and joints became very stiff. This moved to my neck/shoulders, and down my thighs. I lost feeling in my feet and started struggling to be able to take in a full breath. I felt like my whole body was locked up. I started feeling nauseous, but part of that may have been from the nerves. The next morning I felt a bit more mobile but still nauseous and stiff. I have slowly gotten better throughout the day, but am still stiff and exhausted

                                                I had some slight arm pain the day of the shot, but the morning after my arm that received the injection was in so much pain that I could barely even move it. Very little mobility, slight bruising and a red circle around the injection site about 1.5 inches. However, I felt fine most of the entire day besides that. Around hour 28 of getting vaccinated I started to get very bad chills that lasted for about 3 hours. Took my temperature, which stayed around 100 degrees the entire night, 100.5 at its highest point that I checked. The next day it was standing in around 99.9. Felt slight muscle soreness the last couple days, but no fever since then. My arm gained a little mobility on Sunday, 2 days since vaccination so I thought it was getting better. but Monday and today (Tuesday) my knot/lump in my arm at the vaccination site is back to hurting extremely bad and the swelling and size of the lump and red circle is actually growing and pain is starting to increase again.  The red circle is around 4.5 inches now and the pain is sharper where the injection happened.  I am starting to get worried something is wrong, but will give it another day or so before checking in with a doctor.

I slept from 3:45 to 4:30 pm but was still tired and felt weak. I did feel hungry and made dinner over 30 minutes. However, this wore me out. I was even more tired and started getting dizzy. I almost fainted as I made my way to a chair to sit down. I couldn&#39;t eat because of slight nausea and cold chills. I was shaking for about 20 minutes. Eventually, I made it to my bed to lay down, but my legs were shaking as I walked up the stairs. At 6:00 pm, my temperature was 98.8 F. I was freezing a shivering for the next hour in bed under 3 blankets. My hands and feet felt like ice. At 8:00 pm, I had a fever of 100.2  F that lasted all night. My body ached all over, especially at the hips. I couldn&#39;t sit still and couldn&#39;t sleep until 4:00 am. I woke at 8:30 am with some milder aches and fatigue with a temperature of 97.6 F.

No swelling or redness but my arm hurts to touch or move. Beginning this morning (4/1/21) around 7:30 am I started having a headache.  I took an ibuprofen which slightly lessened the pain but it has not gone away all day.  It worsens with activity. Starting around 8:30-9:00 am I started to feel nauseous and lightheaded.  I didn&#39;t take any medication for these symptoms.  They&#39;ve stuck with me all day. Starting around 11:30am I started to feel cold chills and body/muscle aches.  This has continued throughout the day. Starting around 2:45 pm I&#39;ve felt feverish, with severe cold chills.

                                                I awoke at 6:45 a.m. feeling a bit sore in my arm, but relatively okay.  I was up for approximately ten minutes and then extended my arms over my head to stretch out some of the achiness and immediately regretted the action.  I began to feel dizzy and nauseous and saw black spots encroaching on my peripheral vision.  I washed my face to relieve some discomfort with no change.  I walked toward the bedroom to grab my glass of water when the black spots increased, clouded my entire vision, and I collapsed on the bed.  I then began to hyper-salivate and after waking my husband and catching my breath, I returned to bathroom, experienced diarrhea, and simultaneously vomited into the trash can.  The vomit tasted chemical and extremely acidic.  My body was also shaking uncontrollably during this time and I kept switching between chills and being too hot.  After I felt comfortable leaving the bathroom, I crawled back in bed but was shaking so much that I couldn&#39;t stop my teeth from chattering and could not get warm no matter that my husband placed an extra blanket over me.  I had taken my temperature before while I was in the bathroom and it read 94.6 degrees Fahrenheit.  I took it again in bed about twenty minutes later and it read 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.  My head was splitting and my arm ached, but I was eventually able to go back to sleep.  I felt better after sleeping for a few hours and drinking more fluids.

About 5 minutes in, I started to become dizzy, my vision started blacking out, my hearing was muffled, I became clammy, sweaty, and experienced mental disorientation. It became harder for me to breathe, but I never struggled to take a breath. I drank some water and waited for the symptoms to subside. I remained seated and these symptoms went away within 5 minutes. After feeling better for about 5 minutes, I felt cold and was shivering. The woman sitting next to me was completely fine after her shot. I&#39;ve since felt a slight burning sensation on my skin in areas that I have scratched lightly. I&#39;m also experiencing strange feelings throughout my body- specifically my head, leg, and hand. It feels like I can feel something in each area for a bit and then it subsides after several minutes.

I was given benadryl  a steroid and a antihistamine there.

                                                I had the Janssen covid shot yesterday. The shot stung a little and made my arm sore. Later on in the evening I became tired (so far nothing I didn&#39;t assume would happen) so I took a nap. When I woke up, my arm stung worse than when I had the shot and the pain kept shooting up my shoulder into my neck. I went back to sleep, thinking it was just normal vaccine stuff. When I woke up this morning, I had chills, a fever of 101.7, and muscle aches. My body feels like I have a sunburn all over it. My right arm feels like it was stung by a scorpion. I feel dizzy and nauseous, and I have head fog. I feel the exact same way I did when I had COVID19, but with my arm hurting so bad, anything that barely touches it (such as clothes) shoots a stinging pain up my neck

Later that day (around 6:00pm) I started feeling lightheaded, chills and a headache. My hands, feet, nose and hands were freezing but other areas of my body were warm. I also felt body aches- my lower back started with the aches and it spread up to my upper neck. Around 9:00pm I started feeling very hot and this hot/cold changes continued throughout the night. This morning of 4/9/2021 I have less of a headache however, my body is still very sore and I continue to experience the hot/cold changes.

PT with her mother, became light-headed and dizzy while walking from vaccination site back to vehicle for 15 minute wait. PT became unresponsive with mother and fainted.  Parking staff alerted rapid response team, PT regained responsiveness and was given chair to sit on, water to drink.  Rapid response team arrived to a responsive, A&amp;Ox4, pale female who was still feeling weak and light-headed.  PT was transferred to a cot (in the shade) where she was placed in supine position with legs elevated on a chair.  Pt was given water and hard candy to suck on while vitals were taken,,  Airway, breathing and circulation were all WNL.     PT states she presently has a strep infection (throat area)  and has been afebrile, and is to begin oral antibiotics once she picks RX up from pharmacy.     PT began feeling significantly better over 10-15 minutes of laying down in the shade.    EMS LAFD was called and transfer of care to EMS Station 93 for further work-up was instituted.  PT felt much better and was able to stand and ambulate from cot to EMS vehicle without issue.    PT chose to go home with her mother instead of being transported by EMS to medical facility.      Exam (update as needed): GEN: Alert and oriented x 4, relaxed in appearance.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Felt light headed at 8pm. I laid down and then started to get terrible chills. Around 10pm the chills turned to muscle aches all over and a terrible headache. Had a fever of 99.9 at 3am.  The headache and mild muscle aches have continued into the next day as of 9:30am.  The site of injection has been sore to the touch ever since I got the shot as well.

The headache and abdominal pain reached to their peak at night on the same day, and I took extra strength tylenol. I felt better after two hours. I still took the tylenol the following day since the severe headache and abdominal pain came back. It was relieved after a couple hours. The following five days, I had minor headache, felt dizzy and very tired.  I did not any more medicine. I got recovered a week since vaccination date.

After 5 minutes of waiting the patient slumped over and passed out onto the floor.  Her color was very pale and her eyes were rolling in the back of her head.  She regained consciousness but her color was still poor and we called and ambulance because she was still feeling faint.  The  EMT&#39;s immediately took her blood pressure and it was extremely low.  She acknowledged that she did not eat or drink anything at all that morning.  The EMT&#39;s recommended she go to the hospital but she refused.  After 30 minutes with emergency personnel she felt better and well enough to leave with her family member who was with her.

I sweated through all of the clothes and soaked the chair I was sitting in.  That night around 7 pm I got a migraine and felt really fatigued I couldn&#39;t stay awake and I was really sore. My chest hurt and so did my head. I was nauseated to no end The next day was worse. All day I couldn&#39;t stay awake. I felt so sore and sick to my stomach and I coint move too much because I was super dizzy. The next day I was still sick and dizzy  By day four I felt fine just dizzy.

                                                The day I received the shot, I started to feel severe fatigue, headache, light-headed, and started running a fever about 6 hours after the shot was administered.  The next day (4/6) was worse. Severe fatigue, muscle aches, headache, loss of appetite, fever (101.5 was the highest I notice but seemed to be around 101.1-101.3 all day), and general flu like symptoms. However, I also started experiencing abnormal menstrual bleeding. I am on the Depo shot and have been for some time. Due to this, I do not usually experience any menstrual bleeding so I found this to be a little odd. It was not heavy but it was noticeable and contained quite a few clots.   Day 3 (4/7) was about the same except my fever came down and ranged from 99.8-101.1. Abnormal menstrual bleeding continued. New side effect this day included diarrhea.   Day 4 (4/8) I started to see improvement. No fever (that I could tell). Remaining side effects included mild headache, fatigue, diarrhea, and abnormal menstrual bleeding.   Day 5 (4/9), I had one of the worst nose bleeds I&#39;ve ever had in my life. I apologize for the graphic description but it lasted about 20 minutes and my bathroom looked like a crime scene after. Blood was pouring out of my left nostril and I threw two large clots that were about the size of slug (or slightly larger than a fun size snickers... I wish I had a better way to describe it). I&#39;ve had some bad nose bleeds, particularly when I was on Accutane, and this was worse! The rest of the day I felt like I was improving. Energy levels were better. No fever. Menstrual bleeding stopped. Only lingering side effect was mild headache and mild diarrhea.   Since then I&#39;ve continued to feel better and the diarrhea seems like it&#39;s improving.  Mild headache persists. Only new  item is an annoying twitch in my left eye that started on Monday (4/12).

I started feeling nauseous about an hour later. Then at about 9:00 pm, I started to feel really sick. I felt very tired and my whole body hurt. I had a low body temperature, 95 degrees. Chills, fever, shaking, nausea. Very SEVERE symptoms. Felt very disoriented. I thought I was going to pass out and faint. Vision blurry and seen white.  Pounding headache. Ears ringing. I could hardly walk that night, I was crawling on the floor. I felt out of breath. My heart was beating very fast. My left side of my chest hurt by my ribs. When I did wake up from sleep, I woke up with blood in my mouth and dried blood on my lips.

                                                I was tired the night of the shot and my arm was painful near the injection site, hard to move arm and touch caused great pain. My neck also started to lock up from my shoulder across to my spine and up my neck. This lasted about three days with occasional tension in the neck area coming back. Next morning I was very achy and my entire body felt like my muscles had a buildup of lactic acid. I did not have a fever but felt feverish that night. I felt the fever broke Saturday night/early Sunday morning (4/4) while I was asleep. I developed a slight cough for a few days and the muscle aches decreased by half each day. I felt mostly better after a week but occasionally felt tired and the cough lasted about a week. My arm developed a bolus at the injection site in the muscle that took about two weeks to go away, with occasional ice. The arm pain only lasted about 4 days before full range of motion was restored.

                                                I have severe, random, and unprovoked bruising covering both legs. I have abdominal pain that has persistent since being vaccinated. I?m dizzy. I?m bleeding in my urine, stool, and vaginally. Period came early (unrelated to previous vaginal bleeding) and is not clotting. Just significant amounts of red blood, soaking through one ultra absorbency tampon an hour. I have a headache. Went to the ER and my platelets were (345) and my blood sugar low. My bp was 145/90 which is high for me, from the bleeding.  They said I have a ?higher chance of being bitten by a shark? than having a side effect. They diagnosed me with a single contusion and sent me home. Have been feeling worse since leaving the hospital.

So I went to the ER and I got blood work done and I was told something about my CK levels were extremely high and that&#39;s when I was admitted. The day that I got the vaccine I got really dizzy during that 15mins that they make us wait and I felt very sick While I was admitted my CK levels kept going up the doctors told me that I had something rhapdomysosis , the pain got worse and the doctor increased my level of fluids and they did and ultra sound on my legs to check for blood clots and they kept increasing my levels of fluids and once I was let go from the doctor I did have to keep going back to keep getting my blood check. I did continue to feel muscle weakness in my legs while I was home. I did go back to the doctor 05/14 for muscle weakness I was given as bag of fluid.. After that any time I stand too long or I am working out I can no longer work out for as long as I can. I can no longer work out for longer then 15mins because of the pain in my legs. I suffer at night time now with muscles spams now they happen all throughout the night. I had very low potassium

                                                At the time of injection, it was pretty painful and thus sent my body into a shock less than 5 mins after receiving my dose. My vision went white and I was very light-headed and hot/sweaty.  A nurse came with me outside to monitor and I was feeling back to normal in 15 minutes. This is something that happens when I experience a high amount of pain, so just reporting for others who maybe have low blood pressure issues.  At about 8pm, other side effects started to set in. I first experienced a headache, then experienced soreness/ache-y-ness  in my back. Around 8:30, I started to feel light headed again and soon my whole body felt ache-y. I quickly developed chills where I felt so cold that I was uncontrollably shaking and felt very sore/stiff. I have been laying under a heated blanket for the last hour and a half and am finally feeling better with no more shaking  or chills. I still have soreness throughout my body and a headache, but I took ibuprofen around 8:30pm.

Not realizing what it may be related to, I took two ibuprofen and I&#39;ve acetaminophen.  By the time I around home around 6:30, I could barely hold myself up. I ate dinner, which only helped minimally, and by 8 pm felt like death. My husband notice I looked red and felt my forehead, immediately going for the thermometer. I had a fever of 100.5.  We eventually got me into bed after downing a lot of water, but the pain would not ease up. The pain was too excruciating. At 10:30 my husband came to bed and we took my temp again which was 101.6. To help me sleep I took another Tylenol. At 5:45 my work alarm went off and I checked my temp again; still 101.6. I got a cold pack for my migraine and went back to sleep. Slowly throughout the day my fever dwindled, until it finally broke in the early afternoon. By 4:15, as I am writing this, all that&#39;s left is done tiredness, thirst, and a small bit of achiness.

                                                I started feeling subtle flu-like symptoms about 6 hours after receiving shot. At first I thought it was in my head but by the early evening I felt like I had a full blown fever even though I never actually had a fever at any point.  I had chills, muscles aches, head aches, and extreme fatigue. My back hurt especially and overall I felt very weak. I also had pain at the injection site that got worse the following day. I had trouble even lifting my arm to reach a drink just a few feet away from me.  The arm soreness lasted through the Monday following my vaccination (I received it on a Friday). All my symptoms were at their worst on Saturday. I felt much better on Sunday but still had the arm pain through Monday. Motrin did help relieve the worst my symptoms. I thought that was the end of my symptoms but that last week I have noticed what I believe to be a lingering fatigue from the vaccination. While it&#39;s not usual for me to feel tired at points throughout the day, I have been feeling a heavier and more full body fatigue than I usually experience. I have had to take naps more often, sometimes multiple times in a day.  During these bouts of fatigue, my whole body feels heavy and somewhat weak. It&#39;s similar to the exhausted feeling someone might have after they&#39;ve been crying for a while but I haven&#39;t been crying or emotionally taxed in anyway.  Normally when I wake up in the morning, I might feel tired for the first 30 minutes to an hour but once I get moving, I feel better and more alter. I have been having a harder time feeling rested or awake in the mornings and even if I get more sleep than normal, I still feel exhausted. I did not change my routine or diet which I why I think this is related to the vaccine.

The day after I recieved the covid vaccine Janssen, I started noticing the injection site getting red and swollen. By the next day it had grown in size and was itching rather badly. I could sleep from how badly it was itching and burning. It has been 6 days since I got the vaccine and it&#39;s still large and swollen and really itchy. I have been taking ibuprofen for the pain and using benadryl for the itching.

                                                I received the vaccine at 1:30 pm in the afternoon on 3/22/21 and immediately afterwards I felt fine. I waited my 15 minutes and had no signs of a reaction and was free to go. Later in the afternoon, around 3:15 pm, I began to feel a little fatigued and my arm was sore. Around 6:00 pm that same night, I developed a low grade temp of 99.8, I was very fatigued, had achiness all over, as well as my arm was very warm and tender.  I was unable to sleep through the night of 3/22/21 into 3/23/21 and got out of bed around 4: 30 am on 3/23/21 and had to call into work due to the pain. The pain was not an achiness but sharp throughout my whole body. Around 9:00 am, I took a pain reliever and was able to sleep for a few hours. Upon waking up around 1:30-2:00 pm, I was still hurting and was then nauseated as well. I tried to drink water and ate a few crackers to settle my stomach with no relief. At 5:15 pm on 3/23/21, I went to the bathroom and got in the shower to try to help with the pain. After a few minutes in the shower, I became extremely lightheaded and felt like I was going to be sick. I sat down in the bathtub and hollered for my mother to come help me because at this point, I felt like I needed to go to the hospital. Upon sitting down in the bathtub, I began to profusely vomit and started to lose feeling in my legs. My mother entered the bathroom and I explained what was happening and soon after my hands contracted and were stuck in an abnormal position. The pain was unbearable and I was unable to move them from that position. I was unable to get myself out of the bathtub so my mom then called for an ambulance. These symptoms occurred somewhere around 5:20-5:21 pm and EMS was called at 5:22 pm. After a few minutes, I was able to regain movement of my legs but my hands and fingers were still contracted and unmovable. I was able to help my mother enough to put my clothes on and to make my way outside to the front porch to get fresh air. After getting outside, I was accompanied by my mother and my neighbor whom is a nurse. My neighbor looked at my hands and noticed they were discolored and she attempted to straighten out my fingers to no avail. The pain in my fingers was sharp and excruciating but there was also a pins and needle type pain as well. I remained outside until EMS arrived. I was then transported to Hospital where I was seen in the ER for this. Upon arrival to the ER, the physician ordered labs and fluids and stated that apparently he had seen at least 2 other cases that day with a similar reaction to the vaccine. He explained that I was having an adverse reaction to the vaccine and that my hands should return to normal within 24-48 hours. I was then discharged home. As of 3/24/21, I was able to straighten my left hand out and my right hand, my fingers would straighten out, but they would return to a curled resting position. As of 3/25/21, I returned to work and I have some weakness in both hands with a slight discoloration of each hand as well. I am a nurse and work in an office and the physicians in my office commented on the color of skin upon seeing them. I was still very achy and fatigued. My arm was still sore and tender as well. As of today, 3/26/21, I am still achy as well as tired. My right hand has improved some but still returns to a curled resting position. The color of my hands has improved as well. I am a nurse and have seen many things throughout my career. This experience has been absolutely terrifying and I still have no answers as to why this happened to my body. I did my part by being vaccinated and was terrified that I was going to lose my life to it. I pray this does not happen to anyone else.

I told her to stay there for few minutes make sure she was ok. Her husband was getting the vaccine next so I went to start reviewing his paperwork. 5 minutes later he said she didnt feel good. She said she felt like she was going to pass out and wanted to sit or lay down on the floor. Her husband and I helped lower her to the ground and she lay on her side. I asked if she wanted water or anything she said yes. I got her a cold water and she put it against her forehead and said she just needed a minute.   After 10 minutes she got up and sat in the chair and said she felt better.  I then gave her husband his vaccine.   10 minutes later as they wanted after his he said she did not feel well again. She was laying on the floor and said she did not feel like she woulf pass out but just didnt feel right. I asked if she wanted me to call 911 she said yes, just to be checked out.  They came with in 5 minutes and then she said she felt better and was sitting again.   They talked to her and watched her stand up. They checked her pulse and said it was normal and her color was good. She ended up not going with the ambulance and agreed it was probably jsut anxiety  / panic attack.

Noticed a red welt at injection site (bright red, hot to the touch, swollen) 4/7 - red welt inflamed, still hot, sore, became incredibly itchy, whole arm uncomfortable and hurting. All other symptoms gone 4/8 - Inflammation of welt partially faded but red irritation spread out like it was dispersing. Later became darker red, still itching, began to hurt so much that even light fabric brushing across the skin caused pain. Still very warm to the touch. Doctor diagnosed the welt as Cellulitis and immediately issued an antibiotic.

Fever would not break until later that evening even when taking one Tylenol every four hours. Day two I couldn&#39;t tell if I was actually looking at myself in the mirror. I was dizzy and felt high. I could not remember simple tasks I just did like washing my face in the shower. I felt like I was hallucinating. I went to urgent care and they had no recommendations. I was to take the LSAT today, Saturday, April 9. I had to cancel it because I&#39;m still not fully coherent. I still feel dazed and out of it. I tried to go to work yesterday and old lasted an hour. I had a COVID test performed yesterday on my own accord, not per the request of urgent care, just in case I caught it prior to the vaccine without knowing, and it was negative. I can remember things now at least but I&#39;m still not mentally coherent. It&#39;s a scary feeling. I am about three and a half days post vaccine and slowly becoming myself again. I still feel dazed but I am able to have a conversation and remember it.

The dizziness subsided close to 1 pm. At approximately 4 pm I was lethargic, and starting to run a fever with arm pain at the injection site. By 7pm I had no energy, small cough, fever (unknown), chills, and headache. This lasted until 10 AM the next day. Headache lasted until 5 pm the next day.

After asking if it was ok,  I rolled up her jacket and put it on the floor and assisted her in laying down with her feet up on a chair.  After less than 5 minutes the patient felt better, got up, and sat in one of our designated post-vaccine chairs to finish out the 15 minutes. When asked, she stated that she had a similar reaction to another injectable at the dr office and she wasn&#39;t too concerned.  Before leaving, her husband had come to meet her (he was already in the store) and she said she was feeling fine.

Once I was done freezing and with the fever it felt like my skin was on fire. I was in so much pain that night that I couldn&#39;t move without crying. After I slept that night and about 7 hours the next day I finally started to feel better.

                                                I had immediate soreness after the vaccine does. Then at 7pm of the evening after getting my vaccine, I began to feel weak, get chills, and run a low grade fever. At midnight, my fever had increased to 101 and I began taking Tylenol (recommended by Pharmacy). I had sever body aches, muscle fatigue, joint paint, chills and nausea through the night and the next day. In the morning, I had excruciating pain in my abdomen and began vomitting. Later that  day, my fever increased to 102.7 (with Tylenol) and I called my regular doctor. She told me to continue to monitor and if my fever did not decrease by 7pm to go the hospital. Finally, my fever decreased to 101, muscle aches, chills and joint pain continued. I began vomitting uncontrollably for a short period of time. I was very dizzy and weak the remainder of the day. Saturday, my fever finally broke (I sweated all day) but my body was still weak and sore. I also had dizzy spells on and off. Sunday, I felt much better but was still very tired compared to my normal self. I had abdomen pain and burning on and off. I also got hive on my hands Sunday afternoon. After Benadryl, the hives went away but I still felt itchy all over.  Today (Monday), I still don&#39;t feel like myself, but it is the best I have felt since receiving the vaccine. I have never experienced anything like this and was miserable Thursday night, Friday and some of Saturday. It truly was a terrible experience.

A cold pack was given to patient to place on head and Patient was monitored for an additional 20 minutes in exam room/clinic without complication.  No epi/Benadryl was given/needed and I felt patient was stable/safe for discharge home.  No signs of anaphylaxis.  However, strict ED precautions given to patient.  Patient was in right mind state and capable of making proper decision making.

                                                Per patient: I received the J&amp;J covid vaccine on April 5th. The following day I was dizzy, tired, running a fever, and my injection site was very sore. I could not lift my arm above my head without being in pain. I was not able to eat anything the entire day. I attempted to eat some soup but threw it up. I woke up at 3am on Wednesday morning and drank some water but within 10mins I threw that up along with blood. At one point when I checked my temperature it was 104.8. By Wednesday afternoon I was still not able to eat anything but I was able to drink Gatorade. My fever did not break until Thursday afternoon. I was able to go back to work on Friday but my arm still hurt and was red and swollen. The injection site began to itch on Friday and continued all weekend. On Sunday my hand of the arm that had the injection got swollen for about an hour. It is now Tuesday of the week following my vaccine and I feel fine but my injection site is now purple.

                                                Headache (turned into a migraine), extremely drained of energy, lack of appetite, and felt off all day (4/9/21). The next morning (4/10/21) felt the same as the day before, however, had several episodes where I would get really light headed, dizzy, and nauseous. Went to Home Depot at 2:15pm (4/10) and while there my vision blurred and started to fade, I had ringing in my ears and couldn?t hear out of the right and barely was able to hear out of the left. I got very nauseous and I couldn?t breath. I managed to sit on something and put my head between my legs that helped. Fortunately my step- dad was with me and helped me outside while I could barely see and hear and he stated I was very pale. I was having a hard time talking or being conherent. Once outside the symptoms slowly cleared over about the next 6-7 hours. At 4:45pm my mom decided to take me to the doctor but the walk in had just closed and I went to the ER. They stated I had elevated d-dime and did a chest CT scan  to check for blood clots around 7:30pm (I believe not sure exact time) doctor stated they came back clear but when asked if he suspected that the episode and symptoms were due to a dissipated blood clot he would not directly answer it. I overheard him dictating his notes and he started he beloved as such. I have never experienced anything like this before. I still felt drained, headache (migraine), occasionally dizzy, and lack of appetite (4/11/21, 4/12/21) and still currently feel the same drained, migraine, lack of appetite, and occasionally dizzy.

Everyone who has gotten this batch (Johnson&amp;Johnson) today have complained of burning.&#34; 4/7: Experienced severe body aches, chills, nausea, sweat, and vomiting. Headache that lasted all day.  4/8- 4/9: A mild headache that waxed and waned. 4/10: After drinking four alcoholic drinks between 10A to 2P, about an hour apart each, I became violently ill. By the second drink I felt a little sick but passed it off for being outside in the sun. Not being told that we shouldn&#39;t drink after the vaccine I didn&#39;t consider that I shouldn&#39;t. Throughout the day I experienced several blackouts, nausea, chills and a severe headache that lasted until 2A until I was finally able to go to sleep. This was absolutely terrifying as I have never experienced anything like this. I have bits and pieces completely gone of this day. I did not drink enough to black out, nor have I ever experienced blackouts or ever drank enough to cause me to black out. I do believe this is connected directly to the vaccine. 4/11: The headache remained as well as dizziness and nausea. 4/12: The headache waxed and waned along with the nausea. 4/13: I still have a headache and mild nausea.

                                                Called this evening  4/13/21 at 6PM complaining of severe headache with dizziness which started two days ago. She was referred to an Emergency Department which is the closest facility to her. She agreed to go at 6:05PM. We called the ER to advise them that she needs to be worked up for a complication of the vaccine.

My back began to hurt and that then moved into my neck and muscles as a whole with a little headache. The next morning I took Tylenol which I then started to feel a little better but  then at approx 3PM, my muscles began to hurt again, I took another tylenol which did not seem to help and felt nauseated. I then took a shower hoping it would help, but instead thew up after getting out. For the remainder of the night - my overall body felt week and standing up for long periods, I felt dizzy.

                                                Woke up between 10:30 and 11pm night of vaccine administration with full body shaking and shortness of breath. It?s unclear if shortness of breath was a direct result of the severity or the shaking or something else underlying the shakes. Walking or standing for any period of time was nearly impossible. I felt too warm and too cold at the same time and felt myself sweating but also shivering. My temperature was 99.6 (high for me - I?m usually low, around 96-97 on average) which persisted until around 5:30-6am the following morning. A severely painful, throbbing headache was present until well into the next evening. The symptoms of the headache did subside with use of OTC extra strength Tylenol (2 oral every 6 hours, taken twice totally 4 over the course of 24 hrs) but the headache was still felt somewhat even with use of Tylenol. Moderate fatigue was present all of 4/9 and until around mid morning of 4/10. Pain at the injection site was present but only noticed if laying on the affected arm (left) or if the site was accidentally touched. Dull aching at the site was felt on occasion until the following Monday, 4/12. All other symptoms had fully subsided by 4/10. As of today, 4/13, I am symptom free but I have noticed that I am taking deep breaths every once in a while (maybe several times an hour) as if I?m trying to catch my breath/I can?t catch a full satisfying breath. It feels somewhat like breathing through a straw for a few moments and I breath in until a full breath ?catchs?.

I had full body chills, I was shaking back and forth, my head was pounding so hard it felt like someone had a hammer to it, I got in a hot bath and it felt ice cold to me, I was throwing up, couldnt lay down because every part of my body that was touching something was in terrible pain.  Could not sleep.  The next day I had all of the same symptoms except I was sweating a lot along with everything else.  These symptoms lasted three full days.  It has now been exactly three week, I still have pain in my arm the shot was is, it hurts to raise it.  I also still have an incredibly awful headache that will not go away, I hadn&#39;t had a headache is years and years prior to this, I overall have not felt well ever since I got the shot and my reaction was incredibly awful.  Now I have concerns about my headache and body aches that still are not subsiding.

                                                About 7 hours after injection, I got full body chills. I also felt slightly woozy and a little loopy, but that only lasted about 4-5 hours. (In addition, my body felt a little stiff and my hamstrings got really sore, but I think it was directly related to a squat workout I did the previous day.) My temperature was 99F.  I woke up every 2 hours from my sleep. The chills lasted about 10 hours after their onset.  I took Tylenol at the 10 hour mark, and then the chills stopped. Hamstring soreness also subsided.

                                                My first side effects were fatigue and feeling ?out of it?, which started about 2 hours after the injection. At 7 hours after my left leg became numb and a little sore. I started to notice a feverish, tingly feeling on my skin and this would last at least 24 hours. These symptoms quickly spread through my whole lower body. The chills and intense body aches started at 11 pm. I woke up at 2 am that night and had a low grade fever 99.9 F. I took 2 pills of Tylenol. The fever broke around 3:30 or 4 am and I slept through the rest of the night. The next morning 3/09, I felt fatigue, slow, and woozy. I still had chills and muscle aches, although the intensity was less. Halfway through the day the chills intensified, the muscle aches became more severe, and my eyeballs felt like they were burning in the back of my head. By that evening, the fever was back and I couldn?t think straight. My legs ached with a pain that I?ve never felt before. I did not have a severe headache, but I felt that if I exerted myself too much I would get one. My partner said I could barely form coherent sentences, and I was so weak I couldn?t sit up straight. I took 2 more Tylenol that night, went to bed and slept through the whole night. The morning of 3/10 I woke up feeling tired but my skin did not have that feverish feeling. I was no longer sick. On 3/11 I woke up and did my normal morning routine. I ate an egg, some of a Nutella stuffed scone, and drank coffee and water. I took my 3 pills, loratadine, omeprazole, and a probiotic, and I had a severe allergic reaction within 5 minutes of taking the pills. For the next 10 minutes my breathing became labored and wheezy. I experienced severe eosinophilic esophagitis symptoms. For the next week, my EoE symptoms were heightened. I had a reaction after drinking a seltzer water, which does not usually affect me. Within 2 weeks I was back to normal and to my knowledge have not experienced any other related side effects.

I have gotten many shots in my adult life and have never done this. About a week after the vaccine, the normal shot soreness began to turn into extreme stiffness. I experienced weakness and loss of range of motion as well as pain in my left arm.

I took her BP AT 610PM, it was normal at 128/78 and immunization tech held an ice back on the back of her neck.  She recovered quickly and we waited with her for the remainder of her 15 minute wait.  Two people were with her.  We got a motorized cart for her.  She left after the 15 minutes and felt fine, stating no residual issues.

Within 5 minutes after receiving injection I got up and walked less than 10 feet when I began experiencing extreme dizziness, ringing in the ears, lightheadedness, felt warm, and began to feel chills/tingling throughout my whole body but especially in my head.  I ended up passing out and was unable to sit up in a chair without assistance. For about 10 minutes I was profusely sweating all over my entire body, had continued chills/tingling, difficulty breathing and was semi coherent. The nurse at the pharmacy had me sniff ammonia salt and gave me water to help. I waited for 20 more minutes before finally feeling able to get up and walk around the store. Body chills and cold sweats continued for a while but no further symptoms at this time (2hrs after vaccination).

She regained consciousness and I had her lay on the ground on her back. Her blood pressure was 88/69, heart rate was 86 and she was sweating a lot. EMS came and took her blood pressure again and it was 110/80. She went to the hospital for further observation and they did an EKG and said everything was normal, and now she is feeling okay.

The patient immediately complained of feeling dizzy within seconds of completing the vaccination.  She slumped in her chair and was nonresponsive to me for about 45 seconds.  Color was very ashen. We treated patient by leaning her in the triangle position and she continued to talk to me at that point.  At 10 minutes patient felt fine and was drinking water.  She was observed for about 45 minutes total and felt fine when she left the pharmacy.  She kept stating she hates shots and was really worked up about getting the vaccine.

My muscles hurt and a body felt very fatigued. Also, a little bit nauseous. I think my fever got to 100 degrees. By noon, I broke my fever. By three pm I was fine again.  The following days, I had soreness at injection site. I had a couple of headaches. There was one  episode where two weeks later, I did get a panic attack and went to urgent care. I went because it lasted longer than normal. This panic attack lasted for 30 minutes that is why I went to Urgent Care. Usually my panic attacks last for 3 minutes - but I also had personal things going on that could have caused it. No treatment, they just said to relax.

Still having breathing problems, still getting hives, started allegra and I take it daily, I also have to use my inhaler almost daily, I have never had asthmatic symptoms before this.

                                                In ED on 3/11 0246 with the following Chief complaint - I got the johnson and johnson covid vaccine 3/10 at 4pm and now I can&#39;t stop throwing up&#34;  c/o emesis, fever, body aches.  HR 140s. pt is A/O x3. &#43; nasuea, chills fever 101.2. denies throat swelling or SOB. pt presents with swelling at vaccine site and rash to both shoulder blades She does feel lightheaded and dizzy.  Denies any recent illnesses.  Denies any prior intolerance to vaccines. Fever 101.7F Patient has low-grade fever but nontoxic-appearing.   Blood work shows mild leukocytosis with left shift likely reactive otherwise within normal limits.   After 3 L of IV fluids she remains persistently tachycardic in the high 130s to 140s. Additional information for Item 18:  She states she was feeling fine prior to her vaccine, denies any recent illness, sick contacts, recent travel, CP, SOB, abd pain, dysuria. After eating and drinking patient states she feels a little nauseous and having some indigestion so was given some more Zofran and Maalox.   She continues to be presenting tachycardic in the 130s.   Given the rest of the reassuring ED work-up I think this is likely autoimmune response to the vaccine however given her current heart rate I cannot discharge her safely.   Will admit her to medicine team for observation.   SIRS, likely 2/2 vaccine - hold off on antibiotics for now without clear source of infection, procalcitonin negative - tylenol prn for fever   Principal Problem:   SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) Active Problems:   Tachycardia   Asthma  3/12 discharge summary She was given 3L IVF bolus in the ED -- still tachycardic in the 110s, fever has improved.  There was concern for adverse reaction to vaccine and she was given prednisone 60 mg x 1 in the ED.  Her symptoms have improved and she is able to tolerate PO without vomiting.  Of note, she says her entire family had a respiratory viral illness approx 1 year ago which her PCP suspected was COVID 19, but were unable to be tested at the time.     Fever has resolved, has been afebrile x24 hours, leukocytosis has resolved   tachycardia has improved although still HR in the 110&#39;s with ambulation, ordered an echo however patient did not want to stay wanted to follow-up with PCP and have this done there.   Vital signs have been stable, patient states back to her baseline and feeling great.  Would like to go home.

I pulled down my visor and used the mirror to look at my face and chest area and noticed red splotches all over. The rash quickly moved to cover my whole body within minutes of receiving the vaccine. Ochsner had me pull over by the EMT tent and I waited 45 additional minutes to see if I had any other effects. The rash didn&#39;t go away but I didn&#39;t itch and I wasn&#39;t uncomfortable. It was just a surface rash. The rash was completely gone by 10PM that same night. I woke up at 2AM that same night/early the next morning and the whole left side of my body was numb and felt very heavy. I also had a very mild fever and cold like symptoms. These symptoms included chills, dizziness, fatigue, and headaches. All of my symptoms, including the pain and heaviness on my left side, were gone the following morning which was about 36 hours after first receiving the vaccine.

A few minutes later she fainted and fell out of the chair onto the floor. We helped her up to a sitting position and gave her a bottle of water and an ice pack.  The right side of her forehead appeared red from apparent hit on the floor when she fainted.  We had her wait on the floor for about 30 minutes to ensure she remained conscious.  Patient reported an ache on her forehead at site of hit.  She was also sweating and reported feeling hot. Patient had a partner with her who agreed to escort her to an urgent care clinic in the same building as the pharmacy. Store manager in charge took the patient to the urgent care clinic by wheelchair to be examined.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I began to feel nauseous, almost like being car sick while looking at my phone. I also began to feel tightness in my chest. After my 15 minutes were up I asked the administrator of my shot if it was normal that I felt dizzy/chest tightness. They said it was probably fine and just to monitor my  symptoms. I went and sat in my car a few min and I began to feel very strange, it seemed very bright out, I felt weak, and my eyes felt very heavy. I wanted to get home so I started driving but on the highway, my heart beat was very fast and I began to feel like I couldn&#39;t swallow. At one point felt as though I might be about to choke so I pulled over because I thought I was going to have to dial 911 as my throat was feeling like it was closing up. I tried swallowing a few times with great effort and after a few minutes the sensation started to lessen. My throat hadn&#39;t closed up completely, however it did feel like it had swelled up.

Her face turned white, and I could tell she was feeling faint.  We assisted her to a safe place to lie down.  A physician on duty at the clinic attached to the pharmacy examined her. We sat in the room with her for several more minutes.  She started feeling better after about 10 minutes and was able to stand with no problem.  We had her call her spouse to pick her up.

Took advil throughout. -Full body shivers despite warm or hot environment and comfort level Beginning about 30 hrs post vaccination vaccination and lasting about 6 hrs.  -Large bump at vaccination point started developing 72 hrs post vaccination. By 5 days post it was the diameter of roughly a baseball but only slightly raised, hot to the touch, very painful, restricted arm function and itched. That evening before bed (5 days post) self treated with 20 minute ice pack,  hydrocortizone cream and performing deep massage moving outward from vaccination point as long as could tolerate pain. Noticed extreme improvement the next morning: area had cooled to regular body temperature marked improvement in pain, size and fuctionality. Repeated &#34;treatment&#34; that evening (6 days post) and today (a few hours shy of 7 days post) area is still itchy, knot has decreased to the size of a bean, pain gone except when poked like a bruise. I will likely repeat self prescribed treatment more time.

For the rest of that day I felt that way it was not until I went to bed and got up the next morning that the dizziness was away. On that day when I woke up which was the day after my shot I was achy, tired(slept a lot) and still have the headache. As of today I still have all three symptoms but I would say not as severe.

                                                Two days after Johnson &amp; Johnson, my body launched into an involuntary fit of twisting and flailing movement at bedtime that I now think to be dystonia(?). I sweated terribly. It lasted an hour and a half of screaming and crying. Ehlers Danlos makes my joints and muscles very sensitive to being popped and torn, so it was very painful and remains painful, and now I&#39;m noticing unusual pockets of abnormal memory loss and confusion. Today I ran a red light. I have records of phone calls I don&#39;t remember making, evidence of chores around the house that I did not do. Very odd.

                                                Around 5:30 pm in the evening following my vaccine I started having chills, headache, nausea, and fever of 101. Chills got worse, whole body was shaking and shivering. Nausea progressed into constant dry heaving. Head was pounding with the worst pain I have ever felt in my life, worse than natural child birth and worse than running marathons. The nausea was so bad and I could feel my fever burning and getting worse. I was about to vomit so got out of bed to go to the toilet to vomit and the whole room started spinning completely out of control. My heart was racing and I could hear it and feel it pounding rapidly through my ears. I couldn?t walk and was so disoriented I crawled to the bathroom to throw up in the toilet. My husband heard me and came and picked me up off the bathroom floor and carried me to our bed. As the night progressed fever got worse, head was in almost unbearable pain, severe body aches over my whole body, heart racing and horrible nausea and dry heaving.  I made it through the night. For two days after I had a headache and fever  and nausea and body aches and couldn?t get out of bed to care for my children. By the third and fourth day I was able to get out of bed at times and still felt fatigue, nausea, headache and body aches. Anytime I would stand up for 10 days after the vaccine it felt like I was rocking on a boat. I am almost at 2 weeks and still feel fatigue and dizziness at times. On April 15th, 9 days after my vaccination I had symptoms of a blood clot in my leg. I went to the Emergency Room and was diagnosed with a superficial blood clot of the leg as well as swelling in the vein. I am thankful to be alive!

The shivers stopped and I became extremely tired. I got out of the bath and had to climb back to bed because the room was spinning and I was nauseous. I did not have a fever at this time. I was able to go back to sleep. I woke up about 2 hours later sweating and with a fever of 100.7. I slept for another 3-4 hours and woke up symptom free. My morning went on normal. Ate breakfast and hung out. I was tired in the early afternoon and took a 4 hour nap which is not normal but expected since I didn&#39;t get a good night sleep with symptoms mentioned above in the middle of the night.   I also missed my period that month. My period was supposed to start March 30th and it never came. Confirmed I am not pregnant. Period returned in April on normal schedule.

                                                Seven hours after the vaccine I had a fever of 101 with a headache and chills. An hour later I had a fever of 106.5 degrees. Nothing seemed to work to bring the fever down and I had a very sever headache. I was advised to take a combination of Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen which finally brought it down to 102-103 which lasted three days. I threw up on the third night and I experienced nausea. On the fourth day I went to work, and I was exhausted when I came home, and I had a fever of io2 degrees. I had to take off work for the whole week because I had trouble keeping my fever down to normal. I was fever free after seven days and I was able to go back to work on the tenth day. I have been diagnosed post-concussion syndrome at the end of 2019 and I don?t know if that had an influence on the headaches. The headaches that I got after the vaccine caused similar pain to some I have had before but they did not cause the same symptoms of vertigo.

My arm was sore for the entire evening. I woke up around 2am Saturday morning and became dizzy. I fell to the floor and passed out for a short period of time. When I woke, I was extremely nauseous to the point of nearly vomiting. I had chills and fever. I could hardly move due to weakness - I needed help getting back into bed. When I woke the next morning, I had 100.3 fever, I had a headache and my entire body was sore. My fever went away late Saturday afternoon, but I still felt mildly nauseous. It is Monday and I still have mild nausea and light-headedness. My arm is only slightly sore.

I went to her aid and monitored her until the paramedics showed up.  She was unconscious for a 10-15 seconds with her eyes open before regaining consciousness.  IShe was not having breathing problems or other symptoms of anaphylaxis so i did not administer an epi-pen or benadryl to her.  I rolled her on her side in case she became nauseas.  Then the paramedics arrived and attended to her.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At 7:00am on 3/11/2021 felt light headed as  waking up along obvious soreness on the arm where I received the vaccine- left arm.  Then later around 10:00am a feeling of tiredness came over my whole body.  Around 12:00pm I felt even more tired, lightheaded  and my eyeballs felt as if with high pressure in them and are feel sensitive to the sunlight.  Also, at 12pm, I had lunch, which was my first meal of this day and felt the necessity to lay in bed and take a nap for 20 minutes before returning to work.  While taking the nap I felt tingling on my feet, arms, hands and neck along with certain sudden muscle contractions on the same parts.

Could only sleep short spurts after taking 400 mg of Ibuprofen. 24 hours after the vaccination, my body is still achey, sore at injection site, and uneasy stomach.

Pt took ibuprofen and that seemed to help.  She woke up with another one of these episodes.  She feels like she is shaking but her spouse says she was not physically shaking.  She also had headache, body aches with pain, nausea, vomiting and can hardly walk.  Ibuprofen is not helping with this pain.  pt contacted her PCP and was to call us and and take Tylenol or ibuprofen and rest.

                                                After being administered the vaccine at 7:12 am, when the nurse stood me up and started to walk me to the holding area, I became dizzy, my legs got weak, and there was a loud ringing in my ears. I nearly collapsed as I reached the seat in the holding area they were taking me to. I placed one 0.5MG tablet of my prescription Alprazolam in my mouth and waited for the nurse to bring water. They took me via wheelchair from the holding area to a secluded spot behind a curtain. There, I laid on a cot, received cold water, and a nurse talked to me while I recovered. It felt like I was having an anxiety attack, which has never happened to me after getting a shot before. Fitbit heart rate data shows my heart rate at 105 BPM at 7:00 am (going through the admission process, walking around the facility), 83 BPM at 7:10 am, 79 BPM at 7:15 am, 74 BPM at 7:20 am. Between 8:15 am and 1:25 pm, my heart rate remained between 63 and 89 BPM. My arm was sore and my skin hurt (an issue that I have when I feel very stressed). Additional symptoms arose around 1:35 pm. I began going through cycles of chills, sweating and overheating. My heart rate ranged from 127 BPM and 93 BPM for the remainder of the night. I took Tylenol at 7:07 PM to help with my fever.

I wasn&#39;t able to get up and my arm swelled up really bad.  I was having streak in my vison and really bad dey eyes and mouth.  I had a fever on going for about 3 weeks straight. I called my Doctor the following day and she said it was a normal reaction, if it get&#39;s worse to call her again. I called her again because it got worse, my neck got swollen. left arm was trembling, lymph nodes were swollen, leg leg was pulsating. I started having chills and hot flashes ( I still have some till this day). My Doctor recommended seeing a specialist- Neurologist, Infectious Disease Dr.  The Neurologist said he can see where I get the trembles but does not  want to put me on medication and see if it goes away on it&#39;s own. I have a follow up with him regarding trembles, headache, flashing in my eyes. The Infectious Disease Dr. I&#39;m following up her her again regarding my arm swelling, they prescribed me steroids but had not gone down.  Since all of this I have been very fatigue, this is everyday.

I hung around the site a little longer than instructed to be safe, but felt fine and left. Two hours later, I&#39;ve had no other symptoms besides soreness in my arm and a slight headache.

While waiting, patient started to complain of some anxiety and lightheadedness.  We advised patient to wait a little longer for further observation. A few minutes later, at 12:36 pm patient said the lightheadness was getting worse and then passed out for a few seconds while waiting sitting in our observation area. The pharmacy technician was in the area to hold up the patient and keep her calm while patients mother requested that EMS/911 be called.  EMS came minutes later and patient was coherent and talking to the technician and her mother. EMS asked patient if she wanted to be taken to the hospital and patient agreed.  Patient called a few hours later to follow up with pharmacy staff and informed us that she was discharged and feeling better.

                                                Re: Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Received vaccine at about 10:21am. Developed possible adverse effects at about 4:00pm. Initially I noticed weakness and feeling &#34;out of it&#34;. I was grocery-shopping at the time, and pushing the cart, standing upright, etc. was becoming difficult. Sometime between 4:00pm and 5:00pm I became delirious and also was no longer able to stand or sit upright. In my altered state I believed that my muscles, especially those in my legs, were turning into goo and then turning into normal muscles again. I experienced fever dreams. I had hot flashes and chills. I had the worst pain that I have experienced in recent memory.  I think that I may have had a migraine episode in addition to, and triggered by, these experiences. I had nausea (no vomiting).  Most of these events lasted until about between 12:30am to 1:00am, which was when I fell asleep. When I woke up the following morning (today as I am reporting), I still had a mild headache and exhaustion but the other events had resolved.

Shortness of breath started the next day on Sunday , extreme, far beyond normal asthma or any asthma attack. Went to urgent care on Tuesday- they said it was likely a side effect of j &amp;J and tested me for COVID, kidney disease other things, all came back negtative. Apparently I wasn?t the first person they had seen with shortness of breath. Blood in cough and spit on Wednesday after 2.5 days of  shortness of breath. Dizziness (extreme) throughout and chest pain, sternum hurt, chest tightness. Went to Er. They ran a lot of tests and they too said they had seen others with shortness of breath from j and j. They ruled out many things like pneumonia, a birth control blood clot, any lung diseases with X-rays and blood tests. I was given torkeril to ease the chest pain and tightness which it did. Blood stopped coming up in tissues. Doctor said likely inflammatory reaction to the vaccine in lungs, (I have a piece of paper proving that) and cartilage and sternum., which hurt extremely when he touched it. Blood was likely from burst capillaries from overcompensation from trying to breathe. Recommended I return if more blood came up, which it hasn?t.  Shortness of breath has not subsided. I can?t even hold a phone app without being winded. So email back, don?t call.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I began by feeling stiffness and soreness in my joints and muscles, particularly my back and lower body.  The pain and stiffness worsened, and I began to feel ill similar to a common cold. Approximately 12-18 hours after receiving the vaccine, my symptoms worsened so much that I could hardly stand or move around, and began throwing up. This continued and worsened as my entire body felt pain and stiffness, I felt very weak and fatigued, and I was throwing up violently with frequency. I threw up so much and with enough force that I started to see bright red blood in my spittle and vomit. I had a severe headache accompanying these other symptoms.  I also had problems with homeostatic temperature regulation  and was simultaneously sweating profusely and very warm to the touch while feeling like I was cold.  I was shaky and experienced tremors and twitches in my hands, arms, legs, and feet. I kept throwing up and experiencing these symptoms for approximately 72 hours after recieving my vaccine.  I was virtually incapacitated for those three days of severe illness-like symptoms.

                                                Fifteen minutes after leaving  I was experiencing dizziness. During the night while trying to fall asleep I was hallucinating like someone was in my room but no one was there. The next day I felt like I had the flu, and just arm pain. Following days I felt tired and had a headache on the top of my head ranging from a seven to a ten in pain. I tried Tylenol but no help because body rejected it. I tried Excedrin migraine for headaches but still no let up. I am still experiencing headaches and Fatigue.

After vaccine she has reverted back to two canes and has nervous movements that now prevent her from being able to stand up without assistance or circulate well. She is receiving frequent doctor appointments to keep her spine aligned and has been placed in hyperbaric chamber to increase oxygen to her body. She is currently still experiencing difficulties with movement.

The patient got a notification from CVS warning about risks of the vaccine which prompted her concern as well. The patient denies any facial changes, fever, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, urinary complaints, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, or chest pain. The patient has no other symptom complaints at this time.&#34;

After about 5 minutes they subsided, but the same thing happened a few hours later and were so overwhelming I had to crawl on the floor to move. I felt achey and exhausted, with heavy night sweating. The next day, symptoms included  light sensitivity, headache, chills, sweats, body aches, fatigue and a 101 degree fever. My symptoms subsided by the next day, about 36 hours after the initial injection.

On the 5th day (Apr 16), I started to feel pain in my right hip to the point that I feel pain in every step walking, which has never happened to me.  Note: I didn&#39;t exercise since I got the vaccine and maintained pretty good routines for ensuring enough sleep. Today is the 3rd day since that symptom appeared, while I do feel better, the pain hasn&#39;t disappeared.

Fatigue increased dramatically, though it was present prior. Dizziness, sharp pains in left ear in skull, nerve issues. The following is a log from when the symptoms became most intense, so significant I have not been able to drive myself and been working from home due to balance issues, no feeling in feet, and neurological symptoms.

When trying to sleep kept getting head rush static attributed to Benadryl to sleep and staying up too late.   Saturday: very tired. Back hurting in morning. Felt better after getting up.

She was asked to wait 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine before leaving the pharmacy and remained seated in the post vaccination waiting area chair. She began feeling dizzy and lightheaded. She was caught by her family members and the pharmacist on duty before she fell. She briefly had a mild seizure and lost consciousness for a minute. When she regained consciousness she stated that she felt nauseous and was seeing double. 911 was called. EMTs arrived and checked her alertness and how she was feeling. The EMTs then took her off in a stretcher to the hospital out of an abundance of caution due to brief loss of consciousness.

                                                On May 4th, I fainted shortly after waking up. Light headed and unable to sit upright, stand, or walk. Had a fever. Called out of work.  Headaches, chills, nausea, pain at injection sight, bedridden for most of the day. Around 3/4 in the afternoon I called the doctor&#39;s office (phone kept ringing) so I called the nurse through the insurance company. Nurse advised me to stay home for now but to seek medical care if symptoms persisted for more than 3 days. Symptoms continued but were less severe on Wednesday May 5th causing me to miss another day of school. On Friday May 7th at about 12:50 AM I awoke to severe abdominal pain-the kind the pharmacist had warned me of when getting my vaccine. I could not stand or move. I never take aspirin and yelled for a family member to give me Tylenol. I called the nurse from my insurance company and she asked me a series of questions and advised me to seek immediate medical attention. My family called 911 and an ambulance was sent to the house. They checked my vitals and suggested a family member take me to the ER. My family took me to the Emergency Center. I was wheeled into the ER. ER did test but put &#34;Abdominal Pain, Unknown Cause, (Female) on my paperwork.  I missed another day of work due to my ER visit. Symptoms lessened but persisted for several days.

I started to develop a low grade fever 8 hours after the shot. 13 hours after the shot, I had a 104.1 fever. Along with the fever, I experienced severe body aches and chills, nausea and a horrible headache. I couldn?t walk as my body was so weak and my vision was blurry. About 15 hours after the vaccine, my fever went down to 102. I was able to get up and walk to my kitchen to take some Advil. My fever broke 20 hours after the vaccine with the medicine. I?m still experiencing severe body aches, headache, nausea and chills and it has been about 30 hours after vaccine. I did have covid 3 months ago, and the symptoms from the vaccine were much worse than the symptoms I had with actual covid.

                                                I was fine from 10am until 3:30pm on the day of injection. I started to feel feverish and chills at 3:30 and it progressed into a 99.2 fever with all over body aches and a headache and chills. I took alkasletzer cold medicine with Tylenol in it to help with the fever. It got the symptoms down where I could move and stood in the hot shower for 30 minutes to help warm me up. I felt slightly better and still had fever symptoms and severe body aches. I started feeling unable to move due to the fever symptoms again around 9pm and took 2 extra strength Tylenol that eventually worked and I had some nausea with that. I hadn?t been able to eat because of the symptoms and the nausea could have been from taking meds on an empty stomach. I finally felt able to eat around 10pm and had some food and went to bed. I could barley sleep all night and was tossing and turning due to fever. My nose started to get runny around 10pm before I went to bed. I woke up the next day and still had the fever symptoms, body aches and the worst headache I have ever had, a 10 on the pain scale. I took another 2 extra strength Tylenol and went to sleep for 2 hours. I woke up and could tell the fever had broken and my head was still in pretty severe pain- about a 7 on the pain scale.  I was incredibly fatigued the entire day and felt hot and cold throughout the day. I was incredibly weak and needed a lot of rest. I still didn?t sleep well through the night and woke up friday feeling fatigued. I expended some energy in the am at the dog park and had to sleep for 3 hours during the day which is atypical for me. I woke up Saturday morning (today) still feeling a headache and exhaustion. I will see how the rest of the day goes and am hoping to feel better and don?t know when the symptoms will stop.

I have tried to ice, heat, and move the arm gently, but nothing seems to lessen the pain and soreness. I have no injury history on my right arm or the right side of my upper body.

                                                Immediately after injection at 10:20am, I felt hot and light headed. I have passed out from shots and IVs before so I brought my own smelling salts to my appointment, and I used them as soon as I felt faint, which kept me from passing out.  I felt ok after waiting 30 minutes. Later that day around 5pm, I started getting chills and felt a little achy. At 6pm I checked my temperature and it was 99.9, at 7pm it was 101.9, at 7:30pm it was 104 so I took ibuprofen 400 since I had severe chills, headache fatigue and muscle and joint aches. At 8pm it was 102.7 so I took another 400mg of ibuprofen. At  9pm it was 101.7, and at 10pm it was 100.4 and then I went to sleep.  On 4/12: it was 98.7 when I woke up at 9am, then 99 at 10:30 so I took ibuprofen 400, then 100.1 at 11:30 so I took ibuprofen 400 again. Since noon, the fever has subsided and the fatigue and aches and headaches have become mild so that I could work from home.

While seated with her partner the patient briefly lost consciousness. She regained consciousness quickly and was provided with water, a snack, and a cool/damp towel. The patient was instructed to elevate her legs and maintain a clear airway. Patient remained seated. Patient affect normalized within 10 minutes and the patient reported feeling much better shortly thereafter. Patient and her partner remained waiting at the pharmacy for a total of 30 minutes to ensure that she was alright. Patient reported that she has experienced fainting episodes in high stress situations in the past (eg at concerts, events, etc) and maintained that she will be ok.

Light headedness increased over the next few minutes and I began to feel faint.  My activity device indicated my heart rate took a sharp drop.  At this point, I thought it best to lie down. I spent the next 5-7 minutes on the floor until I was able to sit up without feeling faint. I waited an additional 15 minutes before leaving.  I felt somewhat shaky, but felt better by the minute.

Later that evening came muscle pain, chills, high fever, nausea, vomiting, and migraines. The next day, most side effects went away except for the looming headache. Since the vaccine, patient has been experiencing episodes of dizziness and lightheadedness. There was an article that came out today as it relates to blood clots being a possible side effect of the vaccine and to report any feeling of headaches or possible symptoms that may be related to that.

Within 6 hours of vaccination extreme fever and chills were experienced along with nausea. The next day I experienced the worst headache of my entire life. I could not think or get out of bed. I also had numbness and tingling in my legs. The headache persisted for 5 days, alone with muscle weakness and nausea.  Numbness and tingling were intermittent.

                                                This was Johnson &amp; Johnson Vaccine.  I had the normal symptoms but it still felt very severe. I think there should be emphasis shared that symptoms might be severe. I believe the public should have a clear idea how severe. From 7pm to 12am I experienced extreme temperature changes, burning hot to very cold. I had the shakes. Headache. I took Advil which helped endure.  Buried myself in blankets with heater and heat on.  Drowsy. Experienced some dizziness. Now 3 days later I have some &#39;pings&#39; here and there but uncertain if from vaccine. I feel these in my ovaries and my legs and my side. These are very subtle &#39;pings&#39; (bit of pain but not much). Unsure if worth reporting but I think all this is important. Also, I have anxiety about the effect on this vaccine on the health of women and think it is very important that this is clear before pushing people -- more specifically young women, girls, babies -- to take this, and perhaps, any vaccine. I have been told from 5 friends they experienced heavy bleeding after taking the vaccine. They may have not all taken the J&amp;J vaccine to be clear.  I do not feel great about having taken this vaccine.  I feel like i&#39;ve put myself at risk of some other complications but of course, this is based on news and fear.  I just wanted to share this experience, and I hope that, if anything, the severity of symptoms might be more broadly shared.

                                                The first 24 hours were very difficult for me. I have never been so sick in my life. I got the typical muscle aches, chills, etc. In fact I got every side effect listed plus more. I want to discuss the other side effects. On day 3 I started to develop extreme chest pain and pressure. It is a dull pain as if someone if sitting on my chest that will not go away. I also started to experience sudden bouts of dizziness and vertigo. It will not go away. Today is Day 7 and I spent the night in the emergency room because my chest pains got so strong. However, all the work up came back okay. I also have this strange feeling of electrical shocks running thru my head, those last about .5 seconds and go away, but it is a very weird feeling I have never experienced. I also have a strange desire to constantly burp, when I do my chest pain feels better. If I don&#39;t burp my ears start to feel full and sometimes they ring. Its Day 7 and I still feel SO miserable. Why id no one speaking about these chest pains? I know 5 people who have experienced the same.

Not a typical headache.   6 days later -- experience &#39;brain fog&#39; experience again... again lasted 24-36 hours.  Still able to work as normal , just harder to focus. Also had weird sensations of goosebumps randomly when not cold.   15 days later -- notice that if I rubbed arm near injection site it was sore. Arm not sore at all unless touching it. Then notice a bruise at the site of injection the following day. Also feeling light-headed.

I kept asking her if she was with me, and she would slowly and softly respond yes. Ice packs were placed on her neck and wrists and feet elevated. Patient stated that she was sweating. Within 5 minutes patient was approaching normal. Patient was kept and additional 15 minutes in the pharmacy and observed. Water was given to her at this time. Patient stated they felt fine by the time she left.

Approximately thirty minutes after receiving the vaccine, I began to feel a strange sensation in my vaccinated arm.  It felt as though cold IV fluid was moving through my upper arm down to my hand.  I began to feel dizzy and light-headed to the point I was considering pulling my car over.  After a few minute the dizziness began to subside, but the sensation in my arm continued for approximately 45 minutes.

As the next few days progressed my leg began to get numb and go cold as ice. I have lost my ability to walk and my leg still has shooting nerve pains, gets numb, and twitches. I have gone to the ER, the doctor twice, and a neurologist. Nobody seems to have any answers for me. It is not a blood clot but that is the only thing that has been ruled out.

                                                Patient is a 32-year-old female new patient 5 months post partum &amp; currently breastfeeding, with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and history of childhood asthma, referred by the emergency department to discuss anaphylaxis like reaction to the Johnson Johnson COVID-19 vaccination on 4/28/21.  She received her vaccine around 2:00 p.m. She began developing itchiness in her palms/soles of feet and scalp that quickly developed into a a welt like rash about 3-1/2 hours after receiving the vaccine while on a walk with her husband; this was shortly followed by facial swelling over her right eye.  They made it home and she got in a cold shower to cool down, became dizzy, started seeing spots and had difficulty breathing. Her husband called EMS and she was hypotensive when they arrived.  She was given 2 doses of epinephrine (0.2 mg each per ED note) and a dose of Benadryl which helped. Shortly after the 2nd dose, she began having difficulty swallowing, maintaining the ability to breathe through her nose. She was given a 3rd dose of epinephrine and transferred to the ED; during transport an IV was started with an epinephrine drip. She was seen at Emergency Department; she was given IV fluids, solu medrol, tryptase level and had a normal EKG.  She was discharged with an epi pen prescription. Tryptase is still pending at the time of her visit. She started a new prenatal vitamin at 11 am 4/28/21. Otherwise, she reports no new foods, medications or topical products. She did eat before going on a walk, pepper jack cheese, wheat thins, and black bean hummus. She is pretty sure she was not stung by a bee prior to onset of symptoms yesterday.   Interestingly she reports recent urticarial episodes that occurred in February of 2021. These occurred when she was visiting her in-laws and occurred in the middle of the night, 2 nights in a row during the middle of her visit.  She has never had hives previously.  She reports no family history of hives or anaphylaxis.  She reports no use of new topical products or medications.

                                                Pt was given the vaccine. Within less than 5 minutes, she said she was feeling light-headed and proceeded to pass out. She fell to the floor, and I went out to assist her. She was able to keep her head from hitting the floor, and I supported her head as she regained consciousness. She tried to sit up but lost consciousness again and appeared to convulse (arms and legs drawn up). She regained consciousness again, and was completely lucid. We called 911 and EMT arrived and continued their usual procedures including checking blood pressure, heart rate, and blood glucose. Her BP was 130/80 laying, and 80/60 sitting. Her pulse was 50. Her blood sugar was 56 before consuming glucose and 71 after. She was given water as well. She declined a ride to the hospital but did have a friend give her a ride home.

This went on for several hours before finally falling asleep. The day following the injection, more and more symptoms began to arise such as muscle soreness, cold/hot sweats, low-grade fever (99.5%), chest pain/pressure, sweating, dizziness/disorientation and a headache. Monday night I experienced the low-grade fever however after going to bed, woke up around 5AM barely unable to stand, very disoriented and upon taking my temperature, I took note that I had a fever of 100.9%. Today, Tuesday May 11th, I am experiencing chest pain/pressure, low-grade fever, headache and am lethargic.

                                                About 2 minutes after receiving the vaccine, while parked, I started getting very light headed, felt dizzy, and my heart starting beating extremely fast, and then slowed down and started beating very very hard, and felt like it was going to pound out of my chest. I then had a warm sensation in my throat and started feeling like it was getting harder to breathe. I rolled down my Window, and looked for someone to wave over for assistance, but there were cars in the way, so I closed my eyes and focused on breathing deep and slowly to see if that would make it any better. After about 5 minutes my heart rate went back to normal, I felt I could breathe normally, and wasn&#39;t so light headed anymore. I should have reported this to someone when they told me I could leave, but I wasn&#39;t sure if it was an actual allergic reaction. Or if it was just a stress reaction. I felt like I should at least report it here, because I was completely fine before the injection, during the injection, and right after, until about 2 minutes after being parked.

                                                The morning after my vaccine I woke up feeling very ill, I had a fever of 101 and I was extremely fatigued, dizzy, joint pain and headaches. I stayed home from work. Over the next few days my fever subsided but my headaches, body aches, nausea and dizziness continued. My headaches worsened and on 4/15 my Dr ordered a brain MRI as well as blood work to be sure of no clotting. The MRI came back normal but I later went to the ER due to worsening severe headache and rapid heart rate. I was later discharged and the Dr told me he believes I am having a more severe pro-longed reaction to the vaccine and that he thought my symptoms would subsided around two weeks post vaccine. I am still currently having sharp headaches and joint pain, I have needed to miss work multiple times due to all of this and not feeling well enough to work or do my normal activities.

                                                Around 3:00pm on 3/7/21 I began to feel a little tired. But 3:45pm I was experiencing muscle pain through my body at only continued to get worse. At 4:30pm I took 400mg of ibuprofen since sitting, walking, and lying down were all painful. Relief came around 5:30pm and I was able to nap for an hour. At 6:30pm I awoke and attempted to eat, as I was beginning to feel nauseous. At 8:30pm I laid down again, my symptoms returning and worsening. I was now experiencing chills with my muscle pain and a headache. Pain was located throughout my body and my skin was sensitive to the touch. At 10:30pm I began shaking violently and struggled to feel warm, despite my skill feeling hot. My temperature was not taken. Another 400mg of ibuprofen was taken and one 350mg chewable of Tums anti-acid was eaten. It was not until 12:30am that I was able to sleep again.  The morning of 3/8/21 I was still fatigued and sore. Moving was difficult and painful and nausea was still present, and my headache returned. I was unable to eat despite trying. At 10:00am I took two tablets of Excedrin Migrain and napped for almost two hours. Currently, my muscle aches are minimal and my headache has improved. This may however be due to the medication.

I delayed taking Ibuprofen to not reduce the efficiency of the vaccine but couldn&#39;t endure the chills and shivering as well as the massive pain all over my body. I started with 200 mg Ibuprofen, which helped with all 3 symptoms at least as far as I was able to sit instead of lie all the time.

                                                Yesterday I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I was the last appointment, so they observed me for 5 minutes, and I left. After riding in the car for a few minutes, I noticed that I was having a hard time breathing and my throat felt like it was starting to swell. By that time, the clinic was closed, so I went to the emergency room just in case and sat in my car since they didn&#39;t allow people to sit in the waiting room because if covid.  It started becoming increasingly difficult to breathe, and I was feeling more and more swelling of my throat and tongue. I was having a lot of dizziness, nausea, facial flushing, palpitations, and some mild confusion. I then started getting numbness in the bottom half of my face. Over time, the numbness spread, mostly staying on the left side of my body (face, scalp, lower arms and legs, left side on tongue and inside of mouth). I also started getting a prickling burning pain sensation for brief periods of time where I had numbness. I had decided that if my breathing worsened at all, I would go to the er even though I can&#39;t afford it.   After about an hour and a half, my breathing started to feel less constricted and like there was less resistance. The swelling in my throat was mostly in the upper throat where I had difficulty swallowing but not as much difficulty breathing. The numbness continued to get worse and was sometimes disappearing and reappearing in the same spot.  At 9:30 pm we went to go get some benadryl. I continued feeling less and less swelling and having an easier time breathing. At that point, I went home. Once I was home, my breathing continued to improve and the numbness started to dissipate.  In the middle of the night, I started itching and getting widespread hives and getting a sharp burning pricking pain that would last a few seconds in different areas. The numbness also started coming back mostly in my face. I continued to have difficulty swallowing.  I am feeling much better today. I still feel some slight swelling in my throat when I swallow, but my breathing is fine. I&#39;m still itchy and occasionally breaking out in hives. Im having mild lower facial numbness. I&#39;m also starting to get the normal side effects of fever, headache, arm soreness, and body aches. I&#39;m taking benadryl every 4 hours.

                                                About a minute after I had the injection, my arm started hurting and it felt like hot water was coursing through my veins. I got an immediate headache that progressed into light headedness, my vision got blurry and I saw colors and then I started to lose my hearing, it felt like there was cotton in my ears. The nurses said I went pale and they called it a panic attack, but it was unlike any panic attack I have ever had in my life. I?ve had my TDAP updated a few years ago and got a flu shot and did not feel anything like this. I was rolled out of the room on a wheel chair because I was too dizzy to walk and then threw up several times into a bag and peed myself. It took about 20 minutes before I felt normal again.   The following day my arm felt numb and incredibly sore, I couldn?t raise it that far up without excruciating pain. I felt weak, fatigued and dizzy and was unable to use the bathroom. I had fever sweats and chills on and off. I was not able to sleep well, but I think that?s because of the pain in my arm.

Started experiencing fogginess and feeling cold at 1:00 am 20Mar2021. Went to bed at 1:00 and dreamed of being sick until waking up at 8:30 am 20Mar2021. Woke up and was very weak (could not push toothpaste through toothpaste tube), almost passed out in trying, so I sat on the floor. Tried getting back to bed and was extremely nauseous and started vomiting. After that, I had the sweats/fever/chills for a couple hours (until ~11:00am), and was fatigued until 4:00 pm. Spent most of the day sleeping, unable to do anything. Today, 22Mar2021, feel slight tingling on palm of left hand and fingers. Injection site is still sore and bruised

It was very stiff and sore and there was a sharp pain while going from standing to sitting and in the sitting position. It was a very sharp pain that was shooting down my leg and it wrapped around my hip. It was a constant pain. I also had a little soreness in my neck and shoulders and it lasted two days. I went to see my chiropractor the next afternoon. It was better after that visit and it is still a little stiff after two weeks. I took Ibuprofen as needed since then.

                                                Almost immediately, I had pain in my arm that shot into my shoulder when the vaccine was being injected into my arm. I did not mention it to the pharmacist since I figured it was normal. I sat for 15 minutes as instructed, but  other than feeling sore, I was normal. So we left. After about another 15 mins, My head started for feel &#34;drunk&#34;. I contemplated pulling over since I was driving home, but decided to get home asap.  As time went by, my head felt more and more cloudy, fuzzy, heavy and as if I&#39;d been drinking alcohol. That night, I couldn&#39;t sleep. I even took hydrocodon with tylenol (the pain was that bad) and an ibprofin. It helped a little. I finally got to sleep at 3am, Just to wake at 7am for work. All day, I could not focus, my head was super fuzzy. I had a bad headache, I felt super sick. My stomach also hurt and I couldn&#39;t lift my arm. I tried taking a nap half way through the day because I kept making mistakes at work. It did not help how I felt. Since then, my symptoms have eased but now I seem to have a bad case of acid reflux, which I didn&#39;t used to get randomly.   I have not been to my dr yet and I haven&#39;t done anything else for it. I was informed that I should report my symptoms by a family friend.

                                                The day after receiving the vaccine, I experienced common side effects of fever, chills, body aches, and nausea, which lasted for 24 hours, and then I felt better. Then, 3 days after receiving the vaccine, I suddenly began to have extreme stomach pain, so bad that I could barely walk or stand up straight. My chest felt tight and I had shortness of breath. I thought about going to the ER, but called my GI specialist instead as I thought it could be related to the Xifaxan I was taking, but the office was already closed. The GI office called the following Monday and said the Xifaxan should not cause extreme stomach pain and to go to the ER if it persists, but by this time I was feeling much better. The severe pain lasted two days in total.

                                                I was very ill on Friday night after receiving the vaccination. Flu-like symptoms, high fever, shortness of breath, pain in my abdomen, horrible headache, nausea, dizziness, loss of consciousness and leg pain (both legs). The flu-like symptoms passed on Saturday, but by Tuesday, April 13 I was continuing to have a terrible headache, abdominal pain and leg pain. I saw my primary doctor on the 13th and was sent over to the hospital for an ultrasound of my leg. No clots were found and I was told to continue trying to recover at home unless it got worse. I was seen at the emergency room on April 14th for abdominal pain, leg pain, dizziness and headache. The nurse told me I was probably hysterical over the vaccination being pulled, and I told him this was not the case. They performed CT (without contrast) on my abdomen and head, then released me with instructions to return if I was worse. By the 16th I was unable to walk as my left side was completely numb. I went back to the ER. I had a CT of my abdomen and head with and without contrast. I had a lumbar puncture and several labs. I was given IV antibiotics for some infection they found in my urine. I was given fluids and pain meds, and my BP was shooting up to 145/94 (which is very high for me), when standing. My vision was blurry and I was unable to remember much of the last week. I was admitted from the 16th through the 20th and had an MRV, 2 MRIs, more lab work and medicine for my headache. I was released on the 20th and the headache was unbearable and I was still numb on my left side, going back to my doctor on the 22nd. He suggested the ER, and the ER admitted me back to the stroke unit. I was released on the 22nd with a diagnosis of a hemiplegic migraine that could cause stroke-like symptoms (ZERO history of headaches previously). I was sent home with a walker and home health services. PT visited on April 30th and ordered two visits per week for the next month. I am unable to walk without a walker. I cannot shower or use the stairs without assistance. My memory is still foggy. I am unable to concentrate for long. I often stutter and can&#39;t remember basic words. I have also stopped and forgotten where I am at a given moment. I am on Depakote nightly for the headaches, and they have lessened slightly, but when they flare up it is debilitating and I often vomit. I have instructions to follow up with my primary tomorrow morning and see what the next steps are.

                                                Patient ended up light headed and fainted in the pharmacy waiting area. she recovered within seconds and didn&#39;t need us to call 911.  She stated that she had just gone on a bike ride and hadn&#39;t eaten anything all day before she received her vaccination, which is what she thought was the cause of her fainting..  She waited in the area for at least 20 minutes before she said she felt ok to leave.  She was eating a protein bar while waiting, to help with the low blood sugar.

                                                Injection was very painful and felt immediately as if it was improperly administered causing my arm to go limp (so to speak)  right away. The pain was so intense that I became extremely lightheaded almost to the point of fainting. Within 15 minutes following the vaccination, I started experiencing excruciating arm pain at the injection site . The pain has persisted for the past month with little to no relief, I now have limited range of motion and cannot make certain movements with my arm.

For the next 30 minutes she laid on the floor and drank water because she felt dizzy and like she would faint if she moved to sitting or standing position. Patient was laid on her back with a sweater under her head and her feet elevated on a chair.

                                                Patient experienced sudden dizziness and nausea within 5 minutes of receiving Janssen COVID-19 immunization. Gave her water, crackers and cold/wet rags for her forehead as she felt hot. Took her temperature, returned normal. Gave her a trash can to keep near. Kept an eye on the patient and realized she was getting red in the face and more dizzy than she had been. Went out and stood next to patient, with her mom on her other side. Began to experience light sensitivity, feeling like the room was spinning. Patient almost fell out of the chair while sitting still. Mom used a personal pulse oximeter on patient, all results normal. Asked the patient about other symptoms, such as chest/abdominal/leg pain, headache, shortness of breath. Patient reported a headache, dizziness, nausea and leg numbness roughly 30 minutes following the vaccine. I recommended going to the ER, mom believed it would pass with time, but insisted she never responds this way to immunizations. Patient began to experience stabbing chest and abdominal pain around 45 minutes. Patient&#39;s mom was still hesitant to take her to the ER immediately on her own and asked us to call her PCP. He wanted the patient to go to the ER. Patient believed she would fall if she stood, offered to get a motorized cart, wheelchair or call an ambulance to transport her. Both patient and mom requested the ambulance. Asked a technician to check patient medications and allergies for EMTs, retook the patient&#39;s temperature which was normal again. Stayed with patient until EMTs arrived, reported all symptoms patient was experiencing.

I gave the vaccine and pt said she was okay. a couple minutes later she said she was feeling very warm and asked for something to fan herself with. I asked another pharmacist is get her a cold compress. When she came back with it and went to give it to the patient she fainted and slumped in her chair; she did not fall out of the chair. she was unconscious for less than 30 seconds and lost bladder control. I continued to rub her wrists and neck with the cold paper towel and she regained consciousness and said she was okay. we observed her for at least 20 minutes more and then she left. she said she did not require any further medical attention.

I went to her and she repeated that she was about to pass out. When her head started to roll back I was able to hold her by her shoulders. Her eyes rolled back and her head dropped back and she started convulsing. She lost consciousness for about 10 seconds. When she came to she didn&#39;t know what was happening. She was very sweaty by this time. I asked if she had a history of seizures or had ever fainted before and she answered no. EMS was called. I checked her BP and it was 84/41. The patient tried to stand to assist with finding her husband in the store but I told her she had to sit until EMS arrive. We offered her water and orange juice and she asked for both. When the husband got there we asked him if she has a history of fainting or seizures and he said this has happened multiple times, mostly as a result of seeing blood. He said she hasn&#39;t had seizures but she has had tremors when this has happened. I checked her BP again and it was 116/88. She was feeling a lot better. EMS arrived and she was stable by that point. They recommended that she go to the hospital, but patient opted not to go.

On the following day I developed a rash on my face, head and neck which lasted two weeks . I saw a PCP for my rash and gave me pills to take for 5 days.  As of today my symptoms have resolved.

                                                I received the Janssen vaccine on 4/8/21 at 12:00 pm.  By 5:00 pm that day I began having flu-like symptoms (fatigue, body aches, nausea).  These symptoms carried through to the next day (4/9/21).  When I woke up at 6:00 am on 4/10/21 I had a rash on the backs of my upper arms and the front of my thighs.  As the day went on, the rash progressed to cover my entire body.  I went to the ER around 2 pm where I received a steroid injection and was prescribed oral steroids.  I was fatigued for the next two days, but was able to return to work on 4/12/21.  The rash began subsiding, but overall lasted 2-3 weeks.    I completed my seven day prescription of oral steroids on 4/17/21.  On 4/18/21 I was very fatigued.  On 4/19/21 and 4/20/21 I was extremely fatigued and unable to get out of bed, sit up, or stand up.  On 4/23/21 I woke up at 7:00 am with a swollen face, throat, tongue and lips.  I returned to the ER where they prescribed me another round of steroids, but a lower dose and a longer duration.  I experienced fatigue for 6 weeks after receiving the vaccine.

Around 9:30pm that night I began to feel nauseous. As the night progressed my symptoms got worse. I experienced intense chills and by 11pm had a 100 degree fever. Sunday, March 7th my fever had decreased, but I continued to feel nauseous and have chills throughout the day. Additionally I felt extremely fatigued, weak, and had a throbbing headache. Completing simple tasks were difficult and exhausting. Monday, March 8th I continue to experience significant fatigue, headache, and muscle weakness, but at less intensity. Also, my right arm where I received the injection is very sore. I have also been somewhat dizzy today. I have been taking Advil, drinking fluids, using an ice pack, and resting as much as I can as part of the treatment.

                                                About 25 minutes after receiving the shot, I suddenly felt weak and dizzy. My vision started to go dark. I broke out into a cold sweat all over my body and could barely see anything or move my body and I felt very nauseous. I was nearly unconscious and barely able to talk. This lasted for about 20 minutes and then slowly started to recede after that. I felt able to stand after about 40 minutes, and was eventually able to walk out of the store and be driven home.   I am very very healthy and have no major medical conditions.

While I was sitting down, waiting for about 15 minutes I felt dizzy and fainted. My head hit the floor. The store called the paramedics. I woke up sweating and the paramedics arrived. The paramedics took my bloodpressure and reported it at 84 over 50. They waited while I felt ready to stand up. After a 3 to 4 minutes I felt I could stand up and they took me outside. Once outside they took my blood pressure again and it was at 110/80. I opted to go home instead of the hospital and I feel tired.

                                                I began having a really bad allergic reaction and I was itching all over my body. That same night I began having a horrible headache, and my muscles and joints began aching and hurting. It felt like I was holding a two ton rock over my head when I would try to walk. I took Benadryl and used Sarna lotion for the itching, and took tylenol for the headache and muscle aches. IF symptoms don&#39;t subside, then I will visit the clinic at my job to be treated and see what they could recommend.

                                                I received the vaccination 4/2/21 at 11am and at about 6pm the same day - I felt a sudden flush and felt like I was going to faint in the middle of Grocery store. Got very clammy and sweaty and weak - immediately left the store and started projectile vomiting outside the store and all night the first night. Had extremely joint/bone pain throughout my entire body for 4 days straight in bed, very weak, chills and night sweats, day 2 I had a little energy and drove about an hour and immediately started vomiting again  for day 2-day 5. Day 5 I woke up with swollen eye lids and hands and thought it was an allergic reaction to something in my house so took benedryl, but didn?t help. The swelling went down on day 6. I?ve had no energy and very foggy brain and been very down. My chest has felt like an anxiety attack 24/7 all week. I am on day 10 since the vaccination and my chest pain has increased. I still have foggy brain and been very out of it and weak still. I vomited day 1-day 5. Really bad pain in my hips and arm where I received the shot.

                                                I have never had side effects to a vaccination before so it was completely unexpected  but it had been approximately 9 to 10 hours (which I had a hard time entering on the page prior where it asked me the times.i couldn&#39;t get it to okay how I had the time) but I had felt completely fine and normal directly after and that evening, but close to around 9 or 10 hours later I developed such a high fever so fast when I took it, it was 103.7 and i could barely stand up to get the thermometer i was SO weak and my whole body ached so bad. I couldn&#39;t stop crying I was so miserable and had to have my ex boyfriend come take care of me because I didnt have anyone else to, but it got so bad I was strongly considering going to the emergency room...I tried to sleep but my body was so restless. I took ibuprofen and it broke my fever but today I still feel achey and weak. I definitely wasn&#39;t expecting that because the guy that did mine said it&#39;s rare and if they do happen they are mild...I would consider my symptoms higher than mild. There  was nothing else that could caused it..everything was the same and the only different factor was the vaccine so I&#39;m 100% sure that it was the cause.

                                                Approximately 5 hours after the vaccine I developed a very bad headache followed by chills, sweats, congestion, chest pain, body pain, muscle pain, fatigue and fever. The muscle pain and weakness was so bad I would loose balance when walking. I then started to menstruate clots, not my normal cycle timing,  which lasted about 2 days. The clots subsided but I am still bleeding today. I was in bed for 4 days with severe immune response symptoms. After those symptoms subsided the fatigue was so extreme it was hard to function.

Since then I have had incredible headaches almost daily, lasting a few hours (I have been taking Tylenol for the headaches).  Usually headaches are after 5pm, I will feel dizzy, foggy, and intense pressure, some blurred vision. I do not have a history of migraines or headaches, I have been taking the Tylenol, drinking lots of water, and taking baths to try and help with them.

                                                4 days after the vaccine I started having periodic sharp pains in my uterus which made me think my period was coming. 6 days post vaccine I started bleeding lightly and the periodic sharp pains continued. 8 days post vaccine I woke up in the most excruciating pain of my life. It was the most severe menstrual type cramps I have ever experienced. I also had a severe headache which I never get. I took 600mg of ibuprofen. The pain continued for hours and I tried my best to breath through it. When I went to the restroom there was only a little blood but large amounts of fleshy tissue began discharging from me. Later that day when the tissue seemed to slow down the pain began to subside to a tolerable threshold (although still more severe than normal). I then began to bleed heavier than any other previous cycle. Normally I have a medium bleed for 2.5 days. This heavy bleeding lasted 6 days. I felt extremely dizzy and weak. Finally when the bleeding stopped I started to feel myself regain strength over the next few days although the sharp intermittent jabs of pain in my uterus lasted about three days after the bleeding stopped. I now am feeling back to normal and recovered. I never went to the ER but came very close to going during that time.

                                                Three days the vaccine I got very short of breath with confusion, dizziness and light headed and disoriented.  I felt like there was pressure in my chest and I had some brain fog. I felt like I had water in my lungs. My right arm bicep was contracting and twitching. I had Vertigo which made it very hard to sit down without feeling off balance. I was unable to drive. I tried to hope it would pass but I went to the ER on 4/14/2021. The dizziness was getting worse after five days and the pressure on my chest was unbearable. I was advised to drink some water and take Tylenol.  My blood pressure was lower than normal. I finally felt better on 4/21/2021. I could finally get out of bed and not feel like I was going to fall down. I could not drive for about two and a half weeks. I still feel a little out of breath and my brain is a little foggy but it has gotten a little better.

Called doctor at home, they were worried I might get palpations so they suggested an ER visit for testing. By the time I got to the ER, heart rate had dropped slightly, temp was still high.

Her head fell backwards and husband saw this-he pushed her head forward and yelled for help.  When I got to the pt she was unconcious and unresponsive.  I tried to revive pt and she initially did not respond. We called 911.  I lifted her head and she started to gurgle and seemed like she was going to throw up.  She then came to.  When EMT arrived they checked vitals and blood sugar.  All was fine.  Pt refused any other help.  I spoke with pt today and she is fine

Monitored for a total of 30 minutes, numbness spread through mouth yet did not progress further.  Dizziness upon standing.  No additional symptoms.  Healthcare providers noted that if any progression of symptoms occur to report to the emergency room, however, no additional care was needed.     8-10 days post vaccine severe stomach pains after each meal.

                                                I got the vaccine, then was asked (due to having previous allergic reaction to Levaquin in the past, I was asked to wait 30 minutes) I got up and walked a total of 30 feet to sit in a chair. I felt completely normal, up until this point. I sat down and began to text my Mother that I had just got the vaccine &amp; I was told to wait 30 minutes, at this point (2 mins in) I felt normal. I sat my phone down on my lap and was just looking about. I began at that point (2 1/2-3 mins mark) seeing the tile floor morph; the blue tiles and the green tiles kept merging together and forming one color. Then my heart raced, immediately and I started having hot flashes that shot out my ears. My heart raced even more and at that point I had realized something wasn?t right. A National Guards member came up to me and had asked if I were okay, I explained I was not and something was not right. They took me to a medical area and made me take deep breaths, and made me drink some water. My BP was high, and my Pulse Ox had dropped slightly, and then went straight back to normal once they had asked me to stick my head between my knees and keep breathing deeply. Also, both of my ears had turned deep red/purple and they were VERY warm to the touch. They felt as if heat were tunneling out of them. The only way I can explain truly how I felt, and I have NEVER done it fully, I felt as if I was fainting. Out of nowhere I felt as if I was going to pass out ? but it didn?t happen. The entire ?spell? lasted about 20 mins? I was monitored for an additional 40 minutes and was allowed to leave.

Patient was anxious even before administration.Patient came back to pharmacy drop off at about 7.20/7.22pm stating she was not feeling good. She was flushed, her face was pale, patient was alert and communicating. She was really dizzy, so I had her lay on the floor. Requested my technician to get get wet towels and wiped patient&#39;s face. Within 3-4 mins she was feeling much better. But still dizzy. Had her take a few sips of Gatorade and remain laying on the floor for about 45 mins

                                                Brain fog approximately one hour post vaccine. Approximately 4 hours after the vaccine, chills started, approximately one hour after chills (5PM) temperature began to rise. After taking temperature, it was 103.8 degrees Fahrenheit. Took tylenol to attempt to lower temperature, however it did not minimize temperature significantly. In addition to the fever, the onset of intense migraine and severe dizziness occured. Took a second dose of tylenol and the temperature did not reduce- and raised to 104.9 degrees fahrenheit. I was unable to sleep the night the vaccine was administered as my head was throbbing and spinning so intensely. I may have had an increased  heart rate- which likely prevented my body from being able to settle, despite other side effects. I also had loss of appetite due to fever, and was able to eat normally until approximately 2 days after the vaccine. The fever broke approximately 24 hours later, however fatigue set in afterwards and lasted through the following week (felt mostly normal the Thursday after receiving the shot 3/18/2021).

                                                My shot was around 12 noon. I didn&#39;t eat before so they gave me crackers and juice at the site. Afterwards I ate a real meal and two hours later I got dizzy. It was tolerable.  At 9:30 PM I got a fever. Then I felt pressure all over my body, pressing me down; I felt so heavy I could barely move. That&#39;s when my joints started to ache and I had piercing pain in my right knee and the bones in both hands. Then I got really dehydrated. No matter how much water I drank, it wasn&#39;t enough. Then I got chills, then a headache. It felt like I had sold my soul to Satan and he was sucking it out through my limbs, very slowly. I thought I might be an anomaly that died from a bad reaction. I tried to sleep so I wouldn&#39;t feel the pain anymore. That attempt took 3 hrs. The next day my migraine and joint soreness persisted. I felt so weak I didn&#39;t get up for hours. Thr second night I still felt unquenchingly dehydrated. Third day I only felt soreness in my arm from the actual shot.

                                                I woke up 12 hours after I got the vaccine with dizziness, nausea, chills, and joint pain. The dizziness got progressively worse (so much so I had to call into work) with the worst dizziness peaked about 18 hours post vaccine. All symptoms resolved within 36 hours post vaccine. The dizziness felt different than my chronic migraine dizziness. I was more disoriented and it was difficult to stand or walk long distances. I had to lay flat most of the day until symptoms resolved.

Also at the same time I started spotting which I found out it was the symptoms of a miscarriage. On 04/11/2021 I continued with the same symptoms then later on that night i started feeling dizzy the bleeding continued. Around 2am on 4/12/2021 I was bleeding a lot &amp; at 7am I went to the ER and they confirmed I had a miscarriage. I was 11 weeks pregnant. My estimated delivery date was 10/28/2021. On my previous appointments they said everything was going good with my pregnancy the only complication was hyperthyroidism which I had been taking medication for.

                                                At 8pm, about four hours after getting the vaccine I had sudden fever with severe chills and muscle cramps. My hips and lower back muscles cramped so quickly I couldnt walk.  Severe headache with eye pain, light sensitivity and nausea.  I woke up early the next day to severe nausea and vomiting, migraine, muscle and joint pain.  My fever was normal by 4pm, but migraine, muscle and joint pain and nausea still bad. I could not leave bed for entire day.

Approximately 4-5 minutes later I started feeling really hot. Then I started getting nauseous and dizzy. I tried to get up and walk to the pharmacy desk (vaccine occurred at pharmacy) but fainted midway there. I was out less than one minute and after sitting down and having some water and putting ice packs on my face I felt better. I have never in my life fainted before. I wasn?t nervous or scared to have the vaccine.   I followed up with my regular doctor on the Monday following the vaccine and had an EKG and bloodwork done all of which came back normal.

                                                Yesterday at 11am I began to experience severe, high (under rib cage) abdominal cramping and a headache. I fell asleep at approx 1pm and woke up around 4pm with less cramping and a dull headache. The headache continued throughout the evening. I had diarrhea on and off. Each time I stood up I felt faint and lethargic, leading me to spend the rest of the night in bed. Today, my body feels sore and lethargic and my mind feels foggy and tired.

                                                Experienced normal side effects within first 24 hours (fever 100.4, body aches, headache, fatigue). Those side effects went away within a day. However, 5 days after vaccination I awoke with dizziness and fatigue. The dizziness was strong enough that I was unable to work and spent the day sleeping. I contacted my doctor and went in for a visit the next Day. No cause for the dizziness and fatigue was determined, but up one further reflection it is possible that it was a vaccine side effect which is why I?m reporting it here. The dizziness and fatigue was better the next day and completely gone two days later.

She went to Dr. to have a physical since she was feeling so bad.  They did blood work and everything came out fine.  She is going back to the doctor to show them the rash since she forgot to show him when she was there to get her physical.  She is applying alcohol rub which seems to be helping.  All of her symptoms have subsided excluding her rash.

In the 5 minutes waiting for paramedics, the numbness spread to the right hand and up to the right elbow. Dizziness became intense. Once in the ambulance (5-10 minutes after onset), legs experienced light numbness, and chest tightness increased, with what felt like spasms / clenching of the heart muscle. Chills and out of body feeling occurred as well.   Paramedics examined heart, pulse, oxygen, with all being normal. IV was inserted and Ativan was given. After 10-15 minutes symptoms subsided.

                                                I received the vaccine on day 5 of my period.  I take no hormones of any kind and my periods are regularly 5-7 days in length. My period began on 4/6. Instead of beginning to wane, my period started to get extremely heavy and I started passing clots again about 24hr after the injection. On the night of 4/12 I passed an unusually large clot, roughly the size of a hockey puck and felt very faint and weak. I continued to bleed quite heavily until this morning (4/19), for a total of 14 days. I called my obgyn on Tuesday of last week to report the excessive bleeding and that my cervical lymph nodes had become so swollen that it was bothersome to swallow. My Dr said to go to ER if I experienced typical blood clot/PE symptoms and had received no guidance about the effects of this vaccine on menstruation.  I have had mild headaches, sore throat, mild fevers and fatigue as well since the injection

I refused further medical care because I felt better once the ambulance arrived. I visited my primary care doctor on 4/13/2021 to follow up.  He said it was likely an occular migraine.  A blood test was ordered and results came back as essentially normal.  I have been continuing to have dizzy spells, headaches, blurry vision and light sensitivity. An MRI of my  brain and spinal cord has been ordered for 4/29 to rule out other conditions.

From about 8:00 pm - 8:45 pm I experienced a pattern of 30-90 seconds of normal vision, then 1-2 seconds of only being able to see light/colors/shapes (I had lasik in 2016, my prescription was -4.75, the 1-2 seconds of bad vision I experienced was like when I removed my glasses before having lasik correct my vision). This pattern of 30-90 seconds normal vision then 1-2 seconds of bad vision repeated for about 45 minutes. During this time I was also very dizzy and lightheaded.   My other side effects were as expected (fever of up to 102, chills, VERY sweaty, did not have energy to remove my sweatshirt when I was hot, headache).  I am only reporting this in case it is important/helpful for further studies/development of the vaccine and public health.

It has been weeks and it is still very sore and a little swollen, which is right above where I received the injection. It is causing my shoulder to lock up, I cannot move it in certain direction or lift items at times. I have taken ibuprofen every day since then. I finally went to the doctor and they has me taking  2400 mg of prescription ibuprofen and on flexeril muscle relaxers for 2 weeks to see if I get any relief.

Days 2-4 I  had further episodes of light-headedness, fatigue, and felt pressure in my head (no headache,  just pressure) Days 4-6 I had fatigue and tired very easily with physical activity, some episodes of light-headedness, and chest tightness (but no pain when taking a deep breath) Days 7-17 Fatigue similar to when I had mononucleosis, tire very easily with physical activity, less frequent episodes of light-headedness.   No severe headaches, no sharp pains in chest or abdomen, no pain in legs. No excessive bleeding.

It wasn&#39;t especially severe and I figured it would go away.  It did. -- At 10 PM, just after dinner, I noticed my heart was racing, but I also felt tired at the same time.  Both hands were kind of numb feeling, but I&#39;d been laying on the right: I figured it&#39;d go away.  It didn&#39;t.  Heart racing and fatigue continued but right hand was noticeably pins &amp; needles.  Took a very hot shower around 11 PM and felt better, but right hand continues to be &#39;cold.&#39; -- Reporting this because I&#39;d never heard of any neurological(?) effects.  Probably just vaccine doing its thing and interacting with my slightly odd biochemistry.  Hopefully will be better in the morning!  ~ Also, an older member of the household received same lot of vaccine at same time: 0 side effects.

Finally my symptoms let up after 1.5 weeks. I&#39;m fine now, but my symptoms seemed to stay around a lot longer than the 1-3 days generally reported. I&#39;ve never had any symptoms from the flu vaccine or any other vaccine I&#39;ve ever received in my life.

Woke up around 9:30pm with flu like symptoms, lethargic and didn&#39;t feel like I was able to move, but was not comfortable laying in bed. Got chilly shortly after waking up around 9:30 pm. Was able to feel warm with a hoodie, sweatpants, thick socks, and a blanket on.  Was not hungry but felt like eating was not a good idea. I didn&#39;t feel like I had the energy to eat. I was drinking water as I felt it was necessary. I went back to bed around 11:30pm and woke up the next morning feeling fine. My arm was sore for 2 days, afterwards, ached near the injection site, and when I used the upper arm muscles to move my arm. I&#39;m not sure after that because I was taking ibuprofen and Tylenol for cramps.

                                                I developed a cough on or about beginning of May 1, 2021. After accidentally double dosing myself with my ACE inhibitor I went into the ER on 5/11 with light headedness/high heart rate and cough. After multiple tests were done it was  discovered that I had a large satellite embolism. in my lung and another one in my left leg.

                                                The day within 10 minutes I started feeling hot and feverish. Then I started to feel lumping and cramping in my left breast and it persists and it turned in to nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. I also felt body cramping and both of breasts became extremely hard and was not comfortable. I also had muscle aches along with a mild fever for about a week. The pain was persistent. Then on day 2, the headaches started and I couldn&#39;t sleep because every time I moved the headache would cause me to vomit. So, I couldn&#39;t. My vision was blurry and I was not sure if it was due to the headache or the vaccine. I ended up going to the ER on 05/16/2021  for cramping in my left leg which was down by my ankle and was bruised. I&#39;m still experiencing heart palpitations, tiredness, cramps still happen in my breasts,  and there are still moments when my vision goes in and out.

                                                The vaccine overstimulated my thyroid, which produced chemicals, creating sever tachycardia producing 170 BPM&#39;s. When my bloodwork was tested, my thyroid levels were over doubled the limits. I also had high blood pressure. Four days after receiving the vaccine I went to the hospital because I was experiencing a fast heart rate, I was extremely shaky (to where I could hardly stand) and I was having trouble breathing. After multiple tests at the hospital, the conclusion is that I have to let all of the thyroid hormones leave my body. So, basically, I&#39;m just waiting.

Roughly 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine, she started to feel nauseous, develop crampy abdominal pain, and feel lightheaded. She went home and took a shower and lay down in bed. When she got up she again felt nauseous and dizzy. She threw up a total of 6 times, none of which were bloody. She had several episodes of diarrhea throughout the day. Given her ongoing symptoms she presented to the ED.   On arrival, she was febrile to 39.5C, and tachycardic to 145 with BP 98/56 and SpO2 100% on room air. She was given zofran, 1L NS, and tylenol. On repeat, her BP was 75/35 (though no longer tachycardic). She was written for 2 more liters of NS and then endorsed to medicine. Her BP improved w/ SBP in the 90s-110s with continued myalgias, headaches.

                                                First I felt lightheaded/dizzy, then became nauseous, and my feet and hands were numb and tingling, I felt like my tongue was getting bigger but the primary care dr at the clinic didn&#39;t think so. They eventually after monitoring me for awhile sent me down to ER, by then my voice was raspy and scratchy, my lower lip was big, my tongue still felt big. I still felt nauseous. The dr asked me if my eyes are usually swollen and red and I said no. My extremities were still numb and tingling. I got epi and other drugs, zofran, benadryl, pepcid, I think a dose of steroids. The symptoms continued so I ended up getting a 2nd dose of epi. I went home around 5pm. When I woke up that evening to do a neb treatment I was nauseous, my lower lip again big, my tongue felt thick and this time my upper throat felt swollen, I gave myself epi and took myself to ER, they monitored me for 3 hrs the dr was gonna hospitalize me if I got worse, I still felt nauseous and the numbness and tingling feeling in my hands and feet when I left but was not having any airway issues when I left. Not sure if the numbness/tingly is gonna go away in my hands and feet.

By 6:30pm, I was down for the count with the cold sweats, diarrhea, headache and vertigo like symptoms (dizzy when standing or moving). Tylenol was taken for fever and water and Gatorade is all that was drank for the remainder of the night. When awaking around 8am the next morning,  fever was gone as well as chills. headache and dizziness remained. Around 1pm, toast and oatmeal was eaten and started feeling more normal again. by 5pm was fine, just tired and sore still.

Saturday I felt achy and a little unsteady when I got up or walked around (these reactions I expected). Sunday morning I woke up covered head to toe in hives that lasted for three days. I have never had hives so bad before. I called the pharmacy and was instructed to take Benedryl which didn&#39;t work. I took Allegra on Tuesday which seemed to help clear them up by the end of the day.

A few minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient walked up to the counter and said she wasn&#39;t feeling well.  When I went over she said she was really lightheaded and was sweating and felt like she was going to faint.  I had her lay on the floor and elevate her feet.  I put an ice pack on her forehead.  She never lost consciousness and felt better after a few minutes. She eventually sat back up and stayed in the waiting area for a while longer to be monitored.  She did state that she felt a cold rush in her chest right before she became lightheaded. She ended up feeling fine and went home.

I stabilized her and directed my staff to call 911 and store management. Within 15 seconds of its inception, she regained consciousness. We ended the phone call for next level care. We gave the patient an ice pack for her neck and a bottle of water. Once aware again, she mentioned that she hadn&#39;t eaten anything today. We got her a candy bar as well. Within 20 minutes, she was able to walk out of the store under her own power.

                                                A few minutes after the injection I felt strange sensations in my arms. About half an hour after the injection started feeling a little dizzy and tightness in chest and throat. Later in the evening I had mild flu like symptoms, chills aches. The following morning was a Sunday and was feeling better but later that day throat started hurting. Throat progressively became swelled and irritated and extremely sore. Flu like symptoms returned. Throat was swelled and to the peak of pain on Monday night. Tuesday morning I was seen at a clinic and it was a little bit better. It started getting better after that but also it has now been a week and a half and throat is still a little bit irritated. I also have brown splotches that appeared on my face either the night of the vaccine or the morning that have not went away.

                                                Patient received Janssen COVID 19 vaccine and within a few minutes became very lightheaded and dizzy. Patient sat down to try and relieve symptoms and after sitting a minute proceeded to feint. She regained consciousness within a few moments and was then disoriented for a short time. EMS arrived and evaluated her and since she was pregnant she agreed to go with them for further evaluation. We followed up with her the next day, she was feeling better having recovered fully and was told at hospital everything was fine medically with her health and her pregnancy.

                                                Once my vaccine was administered I felt tingling on my tongue and bottom lip. I waited the 15 minutes and felt that the tingling was diminishing. I spoke to the tech and felt ok to leave since I was not experiencing loss of breath or swelling. After about 3 hours I noticed the tingling sensation coming back. I immediately called the pharmacist who administered the shot. After explaining the tingling was mostly felt on my lips and tongue but had no swelling and could breath and swallow just fine. I explained that it felt like when you get a shot for Dental work and that every time I touched the area it would tingle more. He told me that was not a normal reaction and would call in a few hours to check in on me. Sometime around 7 we spoke again and I still had no changes with the tingling. Again, he said he would have the pharmacist who was in call again the next day to make sure I was ok. By 11:30pm the aches in my joints started and I had chills. I woke up for work at 3:25am and noticed the tingling sensation wasn&#39;t as strong as the day before. Once I ate the tingling became more noticeable and was mostly on the right side of my tongue and throat. I also started experiencing a headache and sinus pressure. After arriving I work by 6am I felt exhausted. As the day went on the exhaustion  was becoming so strong I felt that I was fighting to keep my eyes open. The aches in my joints were becoming more intense especially in my hips and hands. At times I felt it hard to hold anything in my hand as closing my fingers became so painful it brought tears to my eyes. I also notice I was sweating profusely but had no fever. Once I was home I took a 2 hour nap. I woke up feeling the same the tingling in my mouth, aches still noticeable and headache still there. I could not stand and even tried to eat but had a loss of appetite. I called the pharmacy and reported the tingling was still noticeable. The pharmacist on duty explained the aches were normal but the tingling was not. I was advised to seek medical attention if I had trouble breathing or had swelling. The pharmacist told me to keep up on rest and fluids and I would recieve another call tomorrow to see how I was feeling. It&#39;s now 9:28pm and there are no changes to the tingling sensation in my mouth/throat. I still have aches and pains that are radiating throughout my body. My headache is still there but not as strong as this morning and I now have ringing in my ears. Every once in awhile I get some good stomach pains but they last a minute or two before going away.

Patient said that she fainted once time before when she got her blood draw.  She admitted that she did not eat anything in the morning before the vaccine appointment.  We did call 911 and the firemen responded within 5-10 minutes and verified that all her vitals signs are normal . Patient declined to go to the hospital.  We have patient sit on the floor, drink some water and eat some Skittles and she did reported she was feeling better.   We had patient call her family to pick her up.

                                                I experienced tiredness a couple hours after receiving the vaccine. Shortly after, body ache set in. The following morning, I woke up with body ache and developed a headache soon after. The headache lasted all day. It became difficult to focus on anything else. I remember I couldn&#39;t even look at my phone screen because it hurt to do so. At times, I felt like the room was spinning around me. Later that night, I checked my temperature and had a slight fever, but it was only a degree or so higher than my normal temperature. I also experienced some chills throughout the evening. I went to bed early that night and woke up feeling like a brand new person with no remaining symptoms.

                                                I got the vaccine at 4pm at the pharmacy where I work. I had no symptoms except for very mild local injection discomfort but was able to do my usual normal activities. At 2 am that evening, I woke up with  a lot of pain in my legs, I felt they were so heavy to move around in bed. My lower back was extremely painful too, I tried to stand up to walk a bit, the pain was very severe and I couldn?t stand straight, it was very hard to drag my feet, they felt very heavy and my muscled were painful to the touch even. So went back to bed, and was in agony. I had to go to work in the morning to open the store I work at until they find me coverage. Driving was very hard with my painful legs. J reached the store and I was walking very slowly, I couldn?t have a full control over my legs, they were painful waist down, and felt very heavy, when I sat down my muscles were painful wherever pressure was applied to them (from the chair).  Lightheadedness: I felt lightheaded when I woke up from bed at night to try to walk and ease the pain. So decided to go back to bed to prevent falls. At work, while walking and sitting, I had episodes of very light headidness and sat often on the floor and lifted my legs. Measured my blood pressure on 3 occasions it was 90/50  then 100/50 then 110/60. One time only I fainted where my colleagues put me down and lifted my legs.  At 8am (morning of 3/9/20201) I had a feeling of  heavy breathing. Needed to take deep breath as if my lung muscles were tired and needed to take deep breath to fill them with enough air. At work and because of the increased intensity of muscles pain, I started to breath faster and deeper coz I was in agony   Headache: severe and excruciating headache started from 6am to 12pm on 3/9/21.   Throughout the symptoms, I refused to take medications to let the vaccine run its course. My family drove me back from work coz I was weak and lightheaded and in severe pain at 10.30am. Came home, took one Advil 200mg at 11am. I was completely pain free  at 12pm. Lungs still felt weak, needed to breath deeper for two days but then got better.

But then by Tuesday (4/6) of the next week I started feeling pain in my right arm and then sometimes I would get the sensation of it falling asleep.  I havent felt that sensation anymore since Sunday (4/11).  By Friday (4/9) I started feeling pressure in my chest in the mornings.  I have been having these two discomforts till today.  Yesterday was the worst feeling it was morning and then all of a sudden everything went white and I was about to faint then my heart started racing so fast.  I have never experienced any of these symptoms in my life.  I am not a person that gets sick or is sick of something.

About 3 days ago I started getting a major headache on the right side that also arrived with blurry vision, mental fog and mild dizziness. Nausea yesterday and today except the headache was much worse. I cried from the pain and this is when I became more concerned. My eyes, mainly the right side and a pressure in my sinuses were very difficult to bare with, subsided some with multiple doses of ibuprofen and Advil sinus but not by much. The headache is unbearable, painful to stand out bend over or move.

                                                My right shoulder joint on the side of the shot started to hurt within a week of getting of the shot. It was very painful, and I had problems moving my arm and carrying my tools. I went to Urgent care and I have been referred to an Orthopedic specialist. I have lost the range of motion in that arm and I can?t lay down on my side. I have never had any problems since I injured that shoulder 20 years ago as a kid. I take an Aleve or Tylenol  if I need to but it does not really help with the pain.

                                                On March 13th, 2021 I was given the opportunity to receive the Janssen Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid 19 vaccine so I decided to go ahead and get vaccinated.  Within 1.5 hours of receiving the vaccine, I began to feel unwell. It started with my left leg going numb. From there symptoms continued to increase. I got very tired could hardly stay awake. Then the chills hit. I could not get warm.  By the next morning (Sunday day 2) I had developed a low fever, headache, body aches and whole body weakness. I could still hardly stay awake still. When I was awake, I was very dizzy and I felt like everything around me was moving but I was not. My left leg still felt numb but I thought it would pass on its own.. Because of how I felt, I just laid around and rested. My injection site was swollen, Red and extremely hot to touch.  Next comes Monday (day 3), I got up that morning, still not feeling well. I made my way to work. That did not go well. The more I moved, the worse I felt. I was completely unbalanced and looked like I was drunk. I couldn&#39;t walk straight, I had to randomly grab onto chairs and sit down. I was feeling weaker by the minute. I left work at that point and went to see my primary physician that afternoon. At this point I could see straight to drive myself, could hardly walk as my left leg now dragged. I had no balance and having lots of dizzy spells at this point. He suggested I head to th ER but eventually decided we could wait until morning to see if things improved at all. If no improvement,  I was to go to ER. Tuesday Morning (day 4), my husband took me to the emergency room. I had reached the point of not being able to walk unassisted. At this point, the weakness and numbness I had on my left, had spread to my right side. We had no idea what was happening. We got right in and discussed what was going on. What lead up to me being there, etc. The ER ran blood work, xrays of my chest and 3 different MRIs trying to figure out if something happened like a stroke. NOTHING was present on any test they did yet there was something obviously wrong with me. My arm was still very Red and hot.. I had developed a lump in my arm where the vaccine was given. After ruling out everything the doctor could think of, he consulted with the on call neurologist since it was obvious to him something was happening with my neurological system. The diagnosis...my body was taking the vaccine as a toxin causing my neurological system to react and shut down. They felt that I should be starting feel better in the next few days as the vaccine settles into my system. I was told to follow up with a neurologist and my primary. I was then discharged from the hospital in the condition I had arrived.  Wednesday (day 5) I spent the day at home, not able to do anything. I napped most of the day. I still felt like crap and had no idea when I would start feeling better. No improvement that day.  Thursday (day 6) I woke up feeling a bit better. My right side was beginning to feel normal again but I was still feeling weak and unbalanced. This is also the day I meet with a neurologist to follow up. I don&#39;t know that this appointment had accomplished much as she didn&#39;t have access to all my medical records. She ended up prescribing me a medication to help with nerve pain I was having in my left side and referred me to do physical therapy. I am to follow up in 2 months.  Friday (day 7) my right side is back to pre-vaccine stage. My left is not. I feel pretty good except the occasional dizzy spell and the fact my left isn&#39;t working yet.  Day 8 and beyond...I&#39;m feeling ok. I went back to work but still have issues with my left side and residual dizzy spells. I began physical therapy 2 days a week to work on strengthening my left side however it has yet to help.  I am now just over 4 weeks post covid vaccine. I am now using a cane to help me walk as my left side has still not returned to normal. It is unknown if it will. I&#39;m in Physical therapy 2x a week still. The lump at injection site is now the size of a pea. I still have moments of unbalanced feeling and dizzy spells.

                                                Started an intense headache a little over 12 hours post vaccine and couldn&#39;t sleep. I started to feel nauseas.  I took extra strength Tylenol with some water and a banana and vomitted less than 10 minutes later.  I took some more Tylenol and was able to finally get some sleep. The next two days I felt very tired and a little dizzy so I just rested.  Two weeks later I am having sinus pain (no congestion), headaches, nausea and dizziness.

The following day, still felt fatigued and had spells of feeling foggy/disassociated, ?out of it.? Unsure if this reaction was due to the medication or not.

After 30 minutes, it slowly diminished and I felt more myself within an hour. (although still had the typical affects from the vaccine: bad nausea &amp; fatigue, slight fever &amp; aches).

                                                Patient had a reaction immediately after the JJ vaccine. Patient passed out for 10-15seconds, her body stiffened up, she felt hot and then cold and started sweating excessively. Patients eyes closed briefly and then opened. Patient then became conscious and was unware what had happened.  Patient is not on any medication and had not eaten all morning. After administering the vaccine a small amount of blood came out. I gave her a cotton ball to apply on the area and to hold. After 20-30 seconds she said she felt faint and hot all of a sudden. Her body then went limp and her eyes began to close. Her body then stiffened up for a few seconds. After shouting her name a few times she regained consciousness and was able to talk. she didn&#39;t realize what had happened. Her body was fine again but she had urinated during the episode.  Upon speaking to the patient I learnt that she was nervous about the vaccination and she had felt dizzy in the past when giving blood. I observed the patient over the next 45 minutes. Her speech was fine, she was still a little light headed. She was in her seat for 40 minutes, then I asked her to stand and to move a little to see how she was. She was able to walk a bit but then sat down as she still felt light headed. She than sipped on water and continued talking and seemed to get some energy back.

The day I reported, it was really bad and I was also vomiting. I went to the doctor and she did some bloodwork. All of the results were fine.   Since then, I&#39;ve been having headaches about twice a week. I&#39;ll first feel dizzy and then start to feel sick before the headache comes.

                                                patient felt light headed and a person standing by notified pharmacy. I, staff RPh, assessed patient quickly and helped her to a supine position on the floor with legs elevated. Patient fainted as she was being helped to the floor. Patient&#39;s eyes was dilated, we called 911 and I grabbed the BP unit and checked pulse. Pt regained consciousness after about 7 to 8 seconds. Pt was able to identify herself and answer all questions. We grabbed an orange juice for the patient as she had not had anything to eat and had just worked out. Pt&#39;s BP was 108/90 and remained around that range for about 5 or so readings. PT drank and was encouraged to lie in supine position with legs elevated for 15 more minutes even though she stated she thought she was fine. Pt waited until 12:55pm and also stated she had fainted with a past blood draw. Pt appeared fine by 12:55pm, bp still around 100/80, pupils is back to normal. 911 was cancelled per patients request shortly after regaining consciousness.

Went to check on patient a minute later and her eyes were fluttering and her breathing altered. She did not respond to me. Her pupils dilated dramatically and she slumped over. I called for a nurse and we lowered her to the floor together. Blood pressure was low (around 100/60) Her pupils started to return to normal and she was able to converse with us. Blood pressure increased slightly but was erratic. Emergency service responders made call to take to hospital because blood pressure would not stabilize

                                                I was extremely tired, experienced weakness in my legs low grade fever up to 100.8 which last for a few hours, I took tylenol and it went away.  I had a headache and lightheadedness and soreness and a lump at the injection site. This all started around 24 hours after the injection, and feeling got worse as the day went on. Many of these has subsided 24 hours after onset. I am currently only experiencing fatigue and a headache and soreness with luno at the injection site.

I went out to my car and over the next few minutes - I was getting hotter - My face was extremely hot and flushed, and hives started developing on my arms and chest. They were burning and itching; my skin was hot to the touch. My chest felt tight and my throat felt swollen, but I was able to breathe (breathe felt a little short, but I was able to take a full breathe). I was also dizzy and felt nauseous. I went to the ER, where they treated me for anaphylaxis with Benadryl, Pepcid, Breathing treatment, and a steroid. After about an hour or so I felt fine, and the dr gave me some medications to take over the next few days.

Had about a  2 second warning that I was going to faint. I felt perfectly fine prior to fainting.  After fainting where I was unconscious for 15 seconds, I was dizzy.  Today (4/4/21) - I am very tired and weak and have lower neck pain due to fall.

Patient then ate a snickers bar in her purse and felt better, stating she must have felt uneasy because she had not eaten and was also a bit anxious after getting her shot. Patient walked out of the pharmacy at the end of her observation period saying she felt fine and was going home. Upon calling the patient 12 hours later on her cell to see how she was doing, the patient said she was fine, and no change since she left the pharmacy this morning.

My arm was immediately tingly and numb simultaneously, and I felt...light and weird. Around 2p, I began feeling feeling lightheaded and weak, and at 6p, I had chills, severe weakness, dizziness and nausea. I couldn&#39;t stand up longer than 2 minutes without wanting to vomit and faint. I couldn&#39;t even stand up long enough to wash dishes, prepare a bowl of grapes to eat or shower. Throughout the night, I sweated so terribly from the chills to the point that my bed was soaked to the mattress pad, and currently at 2:02p on April 6th, I&#39;m still experiencing the extreme weakness, nausea, and chills.

                                                Approximately 9 hours after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA, I experienced sudden fatigue followed by onset of severe muscle and joint pain including severe head pain followed by severe chills followed by fever and excessive sweating. I was very dizzy and felt disoriented. I was in bed when all this happened and was already wearing warm clothes under the covers. The muscle and joint pain was so severe, I couldn&#39;t grip anything including my cell phone (my wrists were in sharp pain). The head pain was so severe I was sensitive to light regardless of how dim it was. I felt like my toes were curled, but that could have been me &#34;bracing&#34; and tightening up due to the total body pain. I could move very little. It was very strange. These symptoms persisted through the night. The following morning at around 9am, I still had a very bad headache that made me nauseated and continued to be sensitive to light. Some of the joint and muscle pain tapered down enough for me to get out of bed to go potty but it was exhausting to walk 5 feet to the bathroom and then get back in bed. I still ran a mild fever. At around 1pm I took a Tylenol that helped subside the symptoms but felt wiped out all day. By the following day (Monday), I was feeling better getting more energy and by that Monday evening, I felt like nothing ever happened. I&#39;m sure these just fall into perhaps the more severe level of the side effects, but I was frightened by the intense sharp muscle and joint pain to the point I couldn&#39;t even grip anything.

                                                Pt was in the store for observation post vaccine.  About 10 minutes after the shot, she came back to the pharmacy and reported she was not feeling right.  She was extremely tired, weak, and dizzy.  She was told to sit down for further observation and given a bottle of water.  About 5 minutes later, she said she was still feeling really bad.  She said she was not thinking clearly and didn&#39;t feel right. She was also experiencing moderate pain down her spine.  She said her thinking was so affected that she wanted to seek treatment.   Patient declined offer to call EMS, and proceeded to an urgent care clinic next door.  Urgent care later called the pharmacy to inform us that patient had been transported to the hospital by ambulance.

I also got dizzy and lightheaded. The girl in the car next to me had waved over one of the attendants as well because she was feeling weird too. I got home and had the worst headache I&#39;ve ever had and felt flu like symptoms and very weak. The next day at work I was so sick I had to go home. I was puking and had diarrhea  over and over for a few hours. I also felt lightheaded and dizzy and weak. Also had the headache. I was getting chills as well once I got home. Today I just feel very weak and just &#34;off&#34;.

On April 8 at 4am, I started feeling sick, chills, feet was cold, a lot of pain on my body, headache, couldnt sleep. I took Ibuprofen 800 and 1 hour later I was feeling a little better. I was able to sleep. When I woke up I was fine. Around 11am on April 8 I started feeling very sick again. I had diarrhea all day.   Evacuated about 10 times during the day. I felt dizzy, nauseas, no fever, pain on my arm, heavy shoulders, back pain, head was lightweight. I took ibuprofen at 12pm and then 8pm. I was able to sleep from April 8 to April 9 and woke up without severe symptoms, only arm pain.

These effects lasted for two hours, then I had anxiety and trouble sleeping for rest of night.  The headache carried on into the morning and became severe. Upon taking Advil, the pain drastically decreased. I had a mild headache, along with fatigue, a little queasy after eating and an unpleasant spacey/dizzy/heady feeling for the rest of the day.  By morning of the 9th, all effects ceased.

                                                Immediately after I got it I felt different. Fight or flight response kicked in. My heart started racing and chest felt tighter. It felt like I just ran a marathon. My breathing increased and I felt very dizzy and lightheaded. I stayed in the store and walked around hoping symptoms wouldn&#39;t get worse for 25 minutes then left. I had my three small children with me and wanted to get them home. I called my husband who is a physician and told him everything I was experiencing. He told me to stay in the store to see how things went. I then drove home to monitor my symptoms. I had post nasal drip and it exacerbated over the next few weeks. I was on two different antibiotics because it felt like I had a bad ear infection. It never went away. I saw an ENT and my tympanaplasty that I had as a child blew. I have a large hole in my ear drum currently and very dizzy. I am getting a CT of my ear this Wednesday and I will have to have surgery in the next few months for another tympanoplasty.

Because it would make me more nauseated.  Terrible headache I fell asleep earlier in the afternoon I had to hold my Stomach and even turning in bed led to more nausea.  Finally fell asleep  dor the night woke up so far today I don?t feel nauseated I do feel dehydrated and I tried to drink Gatorade but drinking  from a cup aggravates it so only like ice chips or popsicles don?t aggravate my stomach    I felt like I was dying just laying on the floor for hours I laid on the. Ahg room floor because the tile was cool and I was near the toilet.  I tested positive for covid asymptomatic in October and then positive again in December with mild symptoms.  I never fully regained sense of smell or taste only partially even though that was months ago.  I wouldn?t wish that vaccine reaction in anyone   I was hesitant sins with already had covid to get vaccinated but was encouraged to do so.  I definitely won?t do that again ever.  It wasn?t that bad actually having COVID that was way worse.

About 2 minutes later he vomited, and then vomited again about 10 minutes later. He was conscious the entire time and could see me and speak to me coherently. She was sweating profusely. We provided an ice pack and called 911. EMS arrived and took his vitals, which  they said were perfectly normal. The patient refused to go to the hospital and hung around the pharmacy for another 10 minutes before leaving, saying he felt much better.

I was sweating and trying very hard to take deep slow breaths. The event lasted maybe 15 minutes and it was 30-40 minutes before I felt able to walk out and leave.

                                                As the vaccine was being administered into my left deltoid, the vaccine hurt at the injection site and I immediately felt very strange and felt a rushing sensation to my head and throughout my body, with a concentration in my upper body.  It felt like an out of body experience: I fainted, hitting my head on the adjacent wall and fell to the ground, where the impact caused a bruise to my shoulder and back.  It was reported to me that I lost consciousness for about 10 seconds.  I felt disoriented, but lucid when I came to.  I was not exactly sure what happened, but I could feel that I hit my head on the right side and asked if I fainted since I was disoriented and on the floor.  With assistance, I was able to sit back on the bench, but felt extremely dizzy, light headed, fuzzy/strange type of blurry vision, and intense sweating.  I did not feel well and knew I would have an unsteady gait if I attempted to stand.  After about 15 minutes, I felt well enough to return home.

Administered the vaccine, gave the patient and her timer, she sat down to be observed. Before her 15 min. was up, she said she was clammy, hot and felt faint. We offered to call an ambulance. She did not want one.  We layed her down in the floor, with legs elevated, took her bp 117/73 (normal), but she was hot. Got her a cold pack and she placed it on her forehead. She layed in the floor for several minutes, but said the cold pack made her feel much better. Waited, we asked her to sit up, took bp again, it was 117/75, she felt better and wanted to go home. Her husband was with her, he drove her home.

It became visibly swollen over the day and unable to turn my head without extreme pain. The lymph node in the area is extremely tender and warm to the touch. Around 5:30 a rash started occuring on the neck where it is swollen.  All of this is occuring on the opposite side of where the injection was given.  No other side effects have been noticed through out the days after the injection until today.

At 6:30pm I began to have uterine/abdominal cramping, vaginal pain, lower back pain. At 7:30 I began to feel extremely overheated and a little fatigued. At 9:00pm I felt chills, extreme fatigue, all over body ache and joint pain. At about 2:00 am overnight I again felt extremely overheated. The following morning I continued to feel fatigue, abnormal temperature swings, body ache and joint pain. This lasted until night (about 30/36 hours after the injection). About 48 hours after the injection, I felt some dizziness and abdominal upset.

                                                Within 5 minutes I started to have flank pain on the rightside. Was having a panic attack so couldn&#39;t breathe well. Flank pain started spreading to my side and mid to lower back. Then it started in the left side. Then it went across my whole mid back and got extremely stiff. Part of my top lip is numb. Over 4 hours and I still can&#39;t breathe properly despite the use of my anti anxiety medicine hours ago. Neck pain. Legs walking in slow motion no matter how hard I tried to push them. Hyperventilating after coughing 2 or 3 separate times. Shooting pain in my back when I lay down. Can&#39;t catch my breath laying down.

                                                Fever got to 104.6,  freezing  so badly couldn?t feel hot water.  Our hands turned purple on the top and our fingers turned white, as if circulation issue - example of how it physically looked.  Couldn?t sit up without almost passing out.  Couldn?t walk without assistance.  Body aches so bad - I?ve never experienced this type of ache, and I?ve had three children.  This all started around 6pm same day of receiving the vaccine.  My husband started the same shortly after.  With exact symptoms, plus he had shortage of breath.  Fevers finally broke 1am- then we both felt better, until later the next day.   Body aches continued, not as badly as day before.  Sweating and chills.  Husband woke up the next night completely drenched from fever breaking.  Fatigue and soreness followed for next couple days.  By Tuesday April 6th finally felt normal again.   Minus continued sore arm.  Wanted to repost due to high fevers, feelings of passing out, and our hands turning purple.  Would think off coincidence if had it not happened to both of us.

Two hours of non stop vomiting/dry heaving i decided I should go to the ER. They gave me saline, zofran, and tylenol through an IV. Blood tests and a urine sample were given.

                                                After I got the vaccine my heart rate went over 100 and I had to lay down at the hospital to recover because I was so dizzy. On Saturday night and Sunday I felt some normal side effects like a severe headache, chills, nausea, and fatigue. Monday I felt better than normal and I thought I was in the all clear. Today (Tuesday) I woke up feeling like I had a stroke. I can still lift both arms and both sides of my face, but I can not think and feel like I am dying. I am scared to go to the hospital. I am unable to work. I feel incredibly emotional and unable to think. I feel so tired and the pain at the injection site is now even worse. I am getting chest pains, dizzy spells, really bad headache, and it feel like I am in a dream state unable to do things I normally can do. I am not okay and really regret getting the vaccine. I had no prior health concerns and probably would have survived covid, but it feels like I may never get my mental functioning back again.

I was unable to sleep due to the pain and around 2am it became severe to the point of being unbearable. Standing would relieve the pressure enough so i attempted to remain standing as tolerable. I also had severe lower back pain that made it difficult to walk. These symptoms remained until apx 3pm the day following the vaccine (4/8/21).

That day afternoon she started noticing generalized headache acute onset and was continuously present for following 4 to 5 days.  She had 1 day of headache free symptom.  And she started noticing fluctuating intermittent headaches since that time until today.  She still has headaches ongoing today.  A week ago she also started noticing nausea which is been ongoing and blames mostly for headache.  It is intermittent and denies any vomiting.  No abdominal cramps diarrhea or constipation or blood in stool.  She also started noticing dizziness 5 days ago which was more intense and frequent at that time but for the last 2 to 3 days it has become in less frequent.  She walked to the clinic today for the fear of driving and dizziness.  Denies any blurry vision but does have photophobia.  She also complains about loss of appetite but she mentions it is coming back today.

Patient was prescribed Fioricet (butalbital/acetaminophen/caffeine). 2021-04-05 - patient developed right-sided neck pain 2021-04-06 - patient got tested for COVID-19, resulted negative on 2021-04-07 2021-04-08 - patient seen at Medical Center emergency department for headache and right-sided neck pain that shoots to (2021-04-08 cont.) the head and shoulder, for which patient self-medicated with ibuprofen. Patient reported to ED provider that using ibuprofen nearly relieves headache and makes her functional and had the most improvement the day she visited the ED prior to her visit. Patient received a CT scan of the head without contrast that was unremarkable. Patient was diagnosed with headache and neck sprain and was prescribed ibuprofen 600 mg, take 1 tablet by mouth every 8 hours, and diazepam 5 mg, take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times a day as needed for muscle spasm. 2021-04-12 - patient developed left lower extremity pain 2021-04-14 - patient followed up with Neurologist outpatient as directed by ED provider and was advised to get an MRV and left lower extremity doppler. Patient was prescribed tramadol 50 mg and butalbital/acetaminophen/caffeine (Fioricet) by the Neurologist. 2021-04-15 - patient presented to Medical Center ED before outpatient MRV and LLE doppler could be done due to worsening right-sided neck pain and inability to ambulate comfortably due to lower extremity pain that had been worsening over several days. Upon examination, there is subtle swelling to left lower extremity and doppler revealed multiple DVTs in left lower extremity. CT head without contrast was unremarkable, however, CT venogram of the brain reveals thrombi of the right transverse sinus and sigmoid sinuses, as well as IJ. Patient was initiated on argatroban and admitted to inpatient at the time of this report. &#34;Heparin induced platelet antibody&#34; and &#34;lupus anticoagulant evaluation&#34; tests are ordered and pending.

Was prescribed decreasing dose of prednisone. This was the morning of the 15th. As the day went on my thighs (both, very high up near groin) started aching. Uncomfortable to walk or sit for long periods. Getting worse as today, the 16th, has gone on. My hips are very achy and sore today. Hives have finally subsided.

                                                I got the vaccine on 4/7/21 at approx. 10am. Soreness at injection site started about an hour later. At approx. 3pm that day I began to have body aches and chills and had a low grade fever and a very bad and continuous headache. Those symptoms lasted approx. 24-36 hours. By Friday 4/9, I was feeling better and fever was gone. Starting approx. Sun 4/11 I began to have a dull headache wrapping around the back of my head/neck and began having muffled hearing (bilateral, but more prominent in left ear). On 4/15 at approx. 1:15pm I was sitting at my desk and suddenly my heart rate went from resting heart rate to 150. I could feel the pounding in my head and ear and also placing my hand over my heart. I tried to stand up to walk around thinking that might help my heart rate, but I felt faint, so I immediately drove myself to urgent care. My heart rate came down and was back to normal approx. 5-10 min from onset. EKG and CT were done in the ER. I was released approx. 5-6 hours after arrival and told to treat headache with Tylenol or Ibuprofen (which I have not done so far because I normally try not to take medications), and follow up with my primary doctor in a week. Headache and muffled hearing are still present today (4/17), predominately affecting left ear.

                                                The next morning I woke up and felt very groggy and slightly chilled. I decided to take a shower to warm up. While in the shower I became dizzy and light headed to the point I fainted. I contacted my family physician. I was told as long as I was feeling okay to be on bed rest for the day with my feet elevated and to continue to drink lots of fluids. I was fine the following day.

                                                Immediately began to feel a headache, dizzy and nauseated.  The doctor on site had me lie down on the floor. Was starting to feel better so was able to sit up in a chair for about 15 minutes. Another wave of dizziness and nausea came over and was lying on the floor again. It was hard to breathe, but oxygen and HR were good. The doctor tried to give me juice to see if it was my blood sugar going low, but afterward, I still felt dizzy and nauseated. It was still hard to breathe. It felt like something was sitting on my chest. BP was elevated, oxygen levels were good, HR was good but I started to get a cold chill where my teeth were chattering. At that point (about 45 min to an hour) the symptoms had not gone away and the ambulance was called. Was transported to the local hospital where I received a liter of saline and Zofran for nausea.  BP was high, but oxygen levels and HR were good. The heart monitor showed no signs of arrhythmia or tachycardia so I was discharged. The doctor believes it was a side effect and not an allergic reaction.

The symptoms subsided about an hour later. Around 11pm, I started to have wheezing, chest tightness, and back pain. I have been using my inhaler and nebulizer since last night for the wheezing. I spoke to a doctor through phone who confirmed these aren&#39;t normal side effects from the vaccine.

Few hours later developed typical &#34;flu like symptoms&#34;.  Next day woke up and both arms, hands, legs and feet and side of face had pins and needles and felt numb. Heart rate sky rocketed and went to ER. Felt like I was going to pass out.  Took blood work at hospital and doctors reassured that the feeling should come back in my legs and arms. When I left  6 hours later my legs were still pins and needles and my joints began to hurt.  A week later and this feeling continues to come and go, but is not consistent.  My joints still randomly hurt and I am an active 38 year old with three kids.

The extreme fatigue, severe headache, dizziness , GI upset and nausea continued throughout the day Saturday and most of Sunday.  I also experienced burning in my chest that radiated into both shoulders, anterior/posterior neck and between both shoulder blades in my back all day Saturday. The burning has decreased over this past week, but I am still experiencing it with some exertion, but not consistently.  Fatigue continues some and SOB at random times.

                                                I received the Janssen shot at 1 pm on the 8th of April, 2021. By 11:00 pm I was in a lot of pain all over my body especially in my bones. My stomach hurt, I was nauseated. I went through hot &amp; cold sweats &amp; chills. I got really light headed &amp; disoriented. I began to get a fever.  I felt far from flu symptoms. My heart was racing. I had to get into my shower repeatedly &amp; just lay. I cried. I dont recommend this to anyone! It has been 2 days &amp; i am still experiencing symptoms. I read the fact sheet for the Janssen shot. I am going to get a check up by a doctor. I feel like I am having an allergic reaction. I never felt so much pain in my life; my side effects are far from the flu symptoms.

I was very pleased nothing detrimental happened at the time. My head and neck were a little itchy but went away, some dizzyness but went away, all after about an hour. The arm didn&#39;t blow up like usual.  That night, I started to experience the usual vaccine side effects i.e. headache, feverish, sweating, joint aches. All this I expected starting around 8:45 -9pm.   At about 10 - 10:30 pm, I began to have abdomen pain/pelvic pain... I started feeling like I was getting period cramps and lower intestinal discomfort. I just had my period though, so it didn&#39;t make sense (about 7 -10 days ago). I am also on the pill so I know for a fact I just had it and started a new pack. I was very confused and thought it was odd...can&#39;t be, maybe it would go away.   I woke up about 3am with intense uterus/period cramps which kept me up, in and out of sleep. About 5am I felt like I had my period (fluid down there), went to the bathroom and indeed, I was bleeding... a lot. The cramps continued, the bleeding continued and now 6 days later it is finally going away. I never get head aches and my head has continued to hurt on and off also.

                                                April 7th about 6:30pm: I became very confused, having trouble remembering where I was or answering simple questions.  Around that same time my vision became blurry, and my face in and around my mouth became numb, I began to slur as a result.  The numbness and slurring increased over the next hour or so.  After that hour or so, I realized I was exhausted and my head hurt so I went to sleep. I also had a strange emotional response to all of this, I behaved giddily and as though it were funny.  April 8th about 8am: I woke up and the confusion, blurry vision, numbness, and slurring were gone.  I had a mild headache, brain fog, and was still more tired than usual.  Later that evening the headache developed in to something more like a migraine, intense pain focused behind my right eye and blurred vision.  At this time I again decided to go to sleep.  It would have been about 8pm.  April 9th about 8am: I woke up still feeling a moderate headache focused on the right side, still tired, and brain fog.  The symptoms weakened throughout the day and by the evening I was feeling mostly normal again.   I have felt healthy and normal since.

                                                I received the vaccine in my left arm. I immediately felt a shooting pain and my left arm became heavy. My left hand experienced the same shooting pain followed by tingling in my fingers. My right arm them experienced the same pain and tingling. I then began to sweat, get dizzy and felt like fainting. I have had pain and tingling in my hands and feet ever since, along with sensitivity. I also have pain in my joints and legs similar to what I imagine arthritis would feel like. I also have throbbing chest pain and pain in my legs since vaccination.

                                                1. I had some mild pain the next day after vaccine.  2. On Saturday, 4 days after receiving the vaccine, I had severe pain that decreased after taking tylenol 3. The arm pain has been consistently present since I received the vaccine.  4. March 25, 2021, I told my nurse practitioner about the continued pain; no intervention was done.  4. On March 28, 2021, I had chills and arm pain, so as a healthcare provider myself, I suspected cellulitis. 5. On 3/302021, I started antibiotic Keflex and finished entire course for suspected cellulitis, yet had no warmth or redness at injection site or surrounding area.  6. 4/15/2021, evaluated by NP again for continued arm pain, as it hurts to turn my steering wheel of my car, lift my arm in any way. Had normal bloodwork for suspected DVT, and STAT ultrasound ordered, after I requested NP to change order to STAT 7. 4/16/2021, had scan for DVT which was negative.  8. Used Tylenol and warmth to area on 4/16/2021, at 11:00pm, and pain increased!!! 9. I am concerned that I have muscle injury at this point, and I need to speak with someone

I have an IUD in place (placed in December 2017).  The first 24 hours after receiving the vaccine,  I had mild symptoms of headache, low grade fever and aches from the neck up. 2 days after receiving my vaccine, my period began and continued as a light period until April 14, 2021.  I continued with headaches in the temporal region and experienced light headedness and blurred vision throughout the day (still continues as of today 4/19/21). I went to my primary physician on 4/15/21 and was sent for labs (CBC, CMP, and TSH level), an EKG (after hearing an irregular heart rhythm), and a MRI of my brain. All of my labs and MRI were reported as normal. My EKG showed occasional PVC&#39;s.

Did not itch which I found strange bc they looked like flea bites. But I went to the ER and said they were purpura.   Also as of Tuesday  April 13th, I have had throbbing headaches daily lasting on and off all day.   Finally today and last night (April 19 and 20th) I have been dizzy.   I am feeling weird.  I regret taking this vaccine.  If there was a way to undo this I would.

I had her lay down and put her feet up. She was given a cold cloth. She is used to this so knew that she just needed to lay down and be still for a few minutes. It was about 5 minutes and she felt like sitting up. She sat up for a few minutes and felt fine. She then went to the chair and was back to her normal self. After 15 more minutes of waiting she stated that she felt fine: back to normal. She is an employee so went back to work and will let us know if there are any more issues. She states there usually isn&#39;t after she starts feeling better.

                                                Within 12 hours I had uncontrollable shaking due to being very cold, 102 fever, profuse sweating all over body for 5 days and completely drenched during the night, severe body aches - loss of full mobility in arms and legs, extremely tired. These symptoms lasted for 48 hours. The sweating continued for 5-6 days throughout the day and was worse at night.   The week after the vaccine, a bump developed on my wrist. It&#39;s believed to be a ganglion cyst, but I won&#39;t have confirmation until after I see a specialist. About a week or two after the vaccine I also developed burning in my feet and it became uncomfortable to walk.

As I was instructing her to remain seated, she passed out and was unresponsive.  She appeared to be having a seizure immediately after that lasted about 1 minute.  Once this episode passed, she became responsive and could talk.  EMS arrived and took over.

I also have yet to have a period since obtaining the shot and I?m 45 days into my cycle that is always 28 days. There are no other explanations for this interruption. All pregnancy tests are negative and my husband has had a vasectomy.

                                                About one hour after my J&amp;J vaccine, I experienced dizziness. I took a shower and felt chills all over my body and back pain as well. I then  went to sleep and my head started to hurt. My head pain grew in intensity and I felt dizzy. At about 7pm, I started vomiting profusely because of my headaches. I then went to urgent care because I am also diabetic and was worried of how I was feeling. At the urgent care they gave me Paracetamol and nausea medication. My headaches lasted 3-4 days then they went away. Also since I was on my third day of my menstrual cycle at the time of my J&amp;J vaccine, my menstrual cycle got irregular and lasted 5 days longer than my usual 3 days.

As the days passed I started getting worst and worst I was loosing mobility in my body my husband had to take me to the restroom. On 04/06/2021 is when I went to the Emergency Room. When I got to the hospital I could not breath my ribs hurt a lot &amp; I had horrible back pain. They put me oxygen and gave me fluids but they said I had to get transfer to another hospital and they transferred me on an ambulance. In the other hospital us where they transferred me they kept poking my stomach when I asked them why they kept poking it they told me that it was to stop the blood cloths. I was hospitalized for 5 days. When I was sent home I was still not feeling good I was feeling sick still I&#39;ve been trying to recover slowly but I am not the same. I&#39;m still in a lot of pain I can&#39;t move my arms because of how much it hurts my back keeps hurting a lot as well. I want to go back to normal to how I was I can&#39;t do anything I can&#39;t even cook for my kids. I now have depression.

                                                Approx 12 after shot I woke up feeling very ill and nauseous. As I walked to the restroom to vomit I lost 100% of my vision, I became very disoriented and had the loudest screeching in both ears. I screamed for my husband and I caught me as I was taken to the floor with no mobility. The episode last several minutes before he was able to move me back to bed. I had severe sweating and ear ringing. As I report this I still have a lingering brain fog and ear ringing.  I reported it to my physician and told to go to the ER if any reoccurrence of reaction.

Burning feeling at injection site continued for several hours.  Brain fog and chills set in within 2 hours post injection.  Fatigue, headache, and joint stiffness and pain started about 4 hours post injection.  Injection was given on left arm; left hand became painful about 4 hours post injection, as though someone had put it in a vice.  Joint pain worsened.  Upon laying down to sleep, I became so cold I could not get warm even with an electric blanket on high.  Started to feel stabbing pains in my jaw, back of my neck and down behind my shoulder blade on my left side.  Headache worsened and started to feel pressure in my ears.  Joints, my knees in particular, felt like they were made of gravel and someone was stabbing them with a hot poker.  Did not sleep due to pain.  Has been 20 hours post vaccine, injection site is still very painful and swollen.  Joint pain, headache, fatigue and chills continue.  Was unable to go to work today.

Couldn?t open eyes or move fingers.  Light headed...blacking out when I got up to go the bathroom.  Couldn?t have any sounds (like tv) on.  Just needed to lay still and sleep.    The above lasted 19 hours.    Then my temperature ended.  I had trouble walking and standing for another 20 hours. No stamina.   I went to work near the end of this and noticed I had trouble looking at my paperwork and figuring what to do for my job.  Not sure if this was still the fatigue just in a different way.  Then it disappeared.

I had the most severe pain throughout the night, unable to move my left arm and nausea from the pain. The fever and chills continued into the next day. Ibuprofen relieves the pain and fever, but it all returns when the medicine wears off. I have a high pain tolerance, and this pain was worse than natural childbirth, and I have given birth twice without any pain medication.

                                                I was fine until about 5 hours later and then oh my was that rough. It started with severe back pain first that came on very sudden. Then I noticed I was sweating real bad and I was so weak it took all my energy to just lift my head off my pillow. Small burst of energy like sitting up became  quite a challenge. All I have done is sleep none stop and when i wake ive noticed a bit of confusion. For example I thought i woke up at 7am tomorrow and then kept falling back asleep on and off till about 8:30 when i realized it&#39;s still today. The body aches and pains were very rough too. My husband went at the same time for the same shot and what Im experiencing vs him is not comparable! He has mild discomfort mine is extreme. Also Ive had a headache a pretty bad one  since about 10pm yesterday as well. Ive been unable to even think about food Im too tired to care even. I have not ate since I was vaccinated yesterday. Ive never reacted to any vaccine or shot of any kind till now.

                                                The shot was administered by a young woman at pharmacy, who I later learned was an intern. She injected the shot less than two fingers down from my shoulder bone, much higher than I have ever had an injection given before.  I immediately felt intense pain, and the intern had trouble pushing the syringe down fully.  She said ?I need help!?, and her male manager ran over, and quickly jabbed the syringe further into my arm, and pressed extremely hard down on the syringe, forcing the remaining contents into my arm. I immediately felt a shooting, searing pain down my entire arm, into my wrist, and  my arm went numb, felt heavy, and tingly by my hand.  The manager pulled the needle out of my arm, and said ?you must have hit bone, the needle is bent?.  I then felt extremely nauseous and woozy, and my vision started going in and out.  I fanned myself and after about five minutes my vision stabilized, and I felt less nauseous.  It is now 9 hours later and I have intense shoulder and neck pain, and limited range of motion of my shoulder.

About 20 mins after vaccine I was slightly dizzy and vision a little blurry. I sat down a few more minutes.  About 3 hours later that even is when the chills, body aches, migraine started.   All thru that night I was in pain.  Next day still felt like my head was in a vice with a migraine.  The chills had gone away. still had body aches just not as severe.  Day 3 after vaccine.  SLight headache (nothing  like the vice headache) , arm is still very sore. body aches have subsided considerably.   I treated with taking Tylenol and using a heating pad on my arm and back to help with body aches and pain,.

                                                On March 10 (the day after my vaccine) I felt the normal body aches and had a pretty bad headache. That all went away in the evening on March 10. Since that day I have had off and on dizziness/lightheadedness. On March 19 I fainted in my kitchen. I hit my kitchen table and had a huge knot on my head and bruises all down my left side of my body. My left shoulder still hurts from the fall and I still have a small knot on my head (left side just above my left eye on my forehead). I went to my primary care doctor on  March 24 and reported the event. I asked if it could be related to the COVID vaccine and she said she wasn&#39;t sure since the Jansen one was so new, but that she had seen these effects from the other two vaccines.  At the doctor&#39;s office my blood pressure was on the lower end (110/60). My normal blood pressure runs about 118/70. They ran some blood work and that all came back normal. They did an EKG in the office, but my blood pressure stayed pretty close to the same as it was the first reading. They then sent me to get a CT scan on my head, which also came back normal. She did diagnose me with a concussion. I was out of work the entire week (March 22-March 26) due to this. She also ordered me to have an echo done. While at the office for the echo, my blood pressure ran 99/46 (this was on March 31). The results of the echo came back normal.  I also got a monitor to wear for 72 hours on March 31. I took that to the doctor on April 5 and I am still waiting on results from that.  Since the event on March 19, I have had headaches and body aches. I have also had slight lightheadedness off and on.

                                                Had my injection at 9am and felt fine.  At 5:30pm it hit me like a ton of bricks. My legs (hips, knees &amp; Ankles)  hurt so bad I could barley walk. My lower abdomen and back also hurt and was cramping as if I was in labor.  I took two Tylenol PM and 10mg of Cyclobenzaprine. Then the chills started, I have never been that cold in my life while I was shivering that is when the sweating started and a basically sweat through three pairs of pajamas last night. Woke up around 3am with a pounding headache. By 10am I was feeling wrung out, but a lot better. I took some more Tylenol and went back to sleep. Woke up around 3:30pm took a shower and was able to take my daughter to soccer. I am still weak and have some achiness in my knees and ankles.

                                                Immediately at 15 minutes: blurry vision; felt off and felt loopy (out of it);  I was dropping food on myself as I was eating. My pupils were really small. I felt out of it. Finally I got home (son drove me). I had mild chest pains and heart racing (had this initially, too). And the chest pains and heart racing kept happening off and on through the night. I had headaches that night and I felt nauseated. Next day, I had to wear sunglasses inside my  house as I was light sensitive and my pupils remained small. I still felt body aches and nausea but the eyes were the biggest concern...shining light by my eyes didn&#39;t make my pupils bigger. The light that came off my phone aggravated my eyes and my head. Thursday, I still had nausea but headache wasn&#39;t bad with Tylenol. Those full two days all I did was sleep. Friday, I felt like things were mild and Tylenol was helping. I called heathline for my eyes. As those still weren&#39;t improving. I got into my eye doctor for an exam (4/9). There was no inflammation and he decided to dilate my eyes. Of course, my eyes were blurry and my eyes responded to that dilation. I napped after returning home. My pupils after the nap were finally responding. I still had a little light sensitivity in my eyes but not as much as I had had and pupils were doing what they should with light. So this was 3 1/2 days later. I still do get mild headache and mild chest pain - it comes and it goes. I have a doctor appt - general check up  - that was already scheduled for tomorrow and he will examine for chest pain.

Carried on with my day like nothing happened.  3/29/2021: (1) Uncharacteristic, debilitating headaches began started around mid-afternoon (ish) and continued on/off - occurred approximately 5-7x and largely tapered off by 4/9/2021.  (2) extreme soreness continuously occurring on the upper right side of my back b/w the spine and scapula. I could barely move it most days. Has gotten slightly better beginning 4/12/2021, but remains unresolved as of this report.  4/15/2021: woke up with severe headache again.

                                                On the day after vaccination I had extreme dizziness and faintheadedness, and heavy brain fog. I could not drive or stand up for long periods of time. I was having issues expressing thoughts and having my normal conversations. This was accompanied by strong headache on right side of my head and slightly stuffed sinuses. The day afterwards all symptoms disappeared. However, they reappeared at milder levels intermittently through the next several days. I am now at day 14 with the dizziness and brain fog still occurring intermittently and last night had short episode of abdominal pain. I decided to call the doctor&#39;s office this morning when the dizziness started again, for advice and to schedule a brief exam. They told me to go straight to the ER instead, so I went and had blood drawn. Blood came back normal and likelihood of clot very low, so was released but referred to my primary doctor and a neurologist for follow up over the next week. The intermittent dizziness and brain fog persist ever since my shot 2 weeks ago. Additional symptoms that I believe to be normal are dull leg pain behind the knees, slight tightness in chest sometimes, and recurring mild headache.

                                                Within minutes of shot, on the shot going in - it stung so bad I cried and I have a high pain tolerance &gt; extreme nausea right after the shot was in; I felt short of breath - Heartrate - While standing in line, my heartrate was 75 or 76  and it went up to 130  beats per minute after the vaccine (I have a watch that tells me); my heart was racing. I was putting cold water bottles on my neck to feel better. Heartrate went from 130 to 100 at 45 minutes out. It stayed in the hundreds for a couple of hours. About three hours after shot - I developed itching and hives all over - chest, arms, and tops of thighs. I took Benadryl. The injection site on arm stayed incredibly painful - I couldn&#39;t even move my arm. 4/12/2021 - I got in contact with someone from Clinic. They felt like there had been a reaction to vaccine - advised to continue Benadryl. A localized reaction to injection site. First 48 hours  bone, muscle, joint pain was extreme - it hurt to be alive. It took a week for that to fade so I could function again. Got in contact with Dr. again 19th. Swollen oval under my skin about 2 -3 inches long at injection site; fatigue and nausea is still there. Ran some bloodwork. Advised to take Benadryl when itching came back. This morning, I called the doctor today 20th - an allergist was pulled in for this conversation as well - I was prescribed to take Zyrtec; Claritin and a prednisone (to prevent reaction from continuing) and also Zofran for the long term reaction to the vaccine. Watch the injection site for any redness and heat (there&#39;s none right now). Three days after vaccine, I did get a blistery rash across my neck at my collarbone area, down my chest and under my breast and across my rib cage on front and a little on my back on the back of my shoulders and down along the spine. Additionally there was a flat orangish rash that developed - on my face and nose. And then my skin started peeling off there and it (that flat orangish rash) showed up  also on the middle of my chest too right in the middle of the other rash on my chest. That is improving with the medications I&#39;m taking.

The next day, I started experiencing migraines and I&#39;ve been having them for about 3 days a week since then. I&#39;ve also been experiencing vertigo for a little over a month, but it has worsened over the last month and has caused me to miss a lot of work. I&#39;ve also been having blurred vision and trouble focusing. I went to the urgent care before I was able to see my doctor, but I&#39;m currently working with her on getting them resolved.
