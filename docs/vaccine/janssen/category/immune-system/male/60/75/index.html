That evening, patient with increasing SOB and increasing oxygen requirement and was admitted for hypoxia &#43; LE swelling.  Although SNF where vaccination took place denied symptoms at time of vaccination, per H&amp;P, increasing oxygen requirements were noted 3 days prior to vaccination.   See H&amp;P below  He is currently residing in a rehab facility following a hospitalization detailed below, but essentially he noted some shortness of breath about 4-5 days ago. They checked his oxygen saturation and noted that he was hypoxic, so started him on oxygen (reportedly 4L NC?). He reports a worsened productive cough; sputum is dark but not bloody in color. He has been fatigued and chilled; he thinks he&#39;s been intermittently febrile. No nausea, vomiting, or constipation. He endorses twice daily diarrhea, but he associates this with his bowel regimen. He also has a fair amount of lower extremity swelling which is bothersome to him; he says this has been ongoing since his MVA in January.[KE.4] He was recently seen in Nephrology clinic, where he was started on lasix 40mg daily and started on a low sodium diet[KE.3]. He is unsure if the lasix is helping his swelling, but does have robust urine output after he takes it

Up to a week after vaccine, I had low grade fever and chills; night sweating and coughing seemed to be getting worse and coughing getting more frequent and worse (when it had been dry and occasional). It was ongoing for a week. I called my Doctor during that time and she prescribed me medications including an antibiotic and cold medications for the cough. The medications helped symptoms after I&#39;d been on them awhile . I no longer have the fever and I stopped the night sweating. Cough seems to be improved.

                                                abdominal aches and cramps gradually increasing in severity; walking and other core body movement provided temporary cessation of increasing severe pain;  the peak of severe pain was accompanied by a bowel movement, followed within about 5 minutes by body temperature increase, sweating, and profuse salivation such that saliva was swallowed every 2-3 seconds for a few minutes.   Treatment was a focus on breathing while practicing the turtle yoga position (forehead on floor with knees folded under abdomen) and then laying flat on back with one or both knees bent.  After 10-15 minutes of this treatment the symptoms (abdominal pain, high temp, profuse salivation) subsided.

Patient reported to emergency department around 10 pm that day (4/9)- says tongue began swelling since 7pm, he took a benadryl at 8pm with no improvement. Per ED physician, patient had &#34;tremendous amount of tongue swelling, I am not even able to visualize the palate he has fullness to his left neck as well&#34;. Patient intubated in emergency room to protect airway.  Patient admitted to ICU where he is still today (4/13). Per chart, the edema subsided on 4/12 and patient was extubated today (4/13). Patient received IV steroids from 4/9- 4/13 (discontinued this morning).  Of note: patient does take lisinopril 20mg daily (start date July 2020). There is concern the angioedema was caused by this medication. Patient received tranexamic acid and Berinert in the emergency department to assist in treating this potential etiology.

                                                On day 4 after the Vaccine was administered, I felt a burning in my throat about the size of a dime. On day 5 the burning feeling was in my entire throat.  I was treating this like a Acid Reflux problem.  On day 6 the burning was there and I was also having an issue with my sinus.  There was blockage at times and other times a lot of mucus was coming out of my nose.  I also developed a cough.  I now started treating it like a head cold.  I took day and night cold remedies.  This continued for 8 more days without relief.  On day 9 I did have a 100.5 fever that went away while I slept throw the night.  I contacted my doctor and was able to see his PA.  I was tested for COVID19 and given a prescription for Doxycycline Hyc 100mg.  My COVID19 results were &#34;None Detected&#34;.  I&#39;ve taken 4 of my prescription pills  and haven&#39;t noticed a change.  I still have an Earache, sensitive left cheek bone, mucus coming from my nose and coughing.  The amount of coughing and mucus has lessened but the earache pain has not diminished.  I also have a bad headache this morning, 16 days after my vaccine was administered.

No difficulty breathing/swallow, thus gave water and gatorade. He was responsive to my questions. He has history of anxiety to needles and he did not eat lunch before vaccine.

Counseled to call pharmacy if any symptoms of allergic reaction to vaccine.

                                                On Monday March 8th I went to the Pharmacy to get the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine under the new 1b guidelines. I am a 62 year old white male with type 1 diabetes, insulin dependent for the past 49 years. I filled out the question form I was presented by the staff and then was given a dose of the J&amp;J vaccine. This vaccine was administered at approx. 1:30 p.m. I was asked to wait 15 minutes to see if I had and acute reaction, following none, I was told I could leave. There rest of the day I was fine. I went to bed at 11:00 p.m. and within 15 minutes I was cold, shaking and sick on my stomach. I took my temp and it was 100.2 F My O2 sat was 95% and heart rate was 120 with feelings of palpitations from time to time. I went to the bathroom and stayed there the rest of the night with frequent vomiting and loose stool. Stomach cramps all night long. Several BGL were taken and even with an insulin pump I was not able to lower my 299 level for over the next 24 hours of repeated bolus. I was finally able to stop dry heaves and fall asleep for moments at a time around 5:00 a.m. My temp finally broke around 11:00 a.m. the next day Tuesday. I had a headache this entire time. I called hospital ( Ask a Nurse ) on Tuesday morning around 8:00 a.m.and enquired about side effects for this vaccine and effects on a type 1, they basically told me to go to the ER or Clinic and be seen by a Physician. I choose not to do either, but to monitor myself and see how the rest of the day went. The first time, other than a headache and complete body soreness my vitals and BGL, were WNL,  was late Tuesday evening around 7:00 p.m. This was a horrible set of side effects. Onset was within 11 hours from injection. No warning for type 1 people to be careful for the possibilities of increased BGL. Today is Wednesday March 10th, and my vitals have remained WNL, but I still have a mild headache and body soreness, some maybe from the vaccine but I believe mostly from the throwing up. Today is March 11th, my vitals are still WNL and BGL is in target. BGL control is responsive to pump therapy now. The past 2 nights I have awoken in a cold soaking sweat that cannot be tied to a low BGL. My body is somewhat still soreness.

                                                Day 1: 11 hours after injection - severe fatigue, dizziness, diminished ability to mentally focus, severe weakness in legs and diminished ability to control legs. Legs intermittently felt numb and at time with &#34;pins and needles&#34; tingling. Knee joints felt as if in danger of flexing backwards. Arms were similarly affected but not as drastically as legs. Arms had better function and control than legs but with marked weakness.  Day 2: Some improvement. Able to go to work but still have fatigue and leg weakness persist. It takes additional mental and physical effort to walk. Walking does not feel automatic or safe like it was before. Still have high level of fatigue. Symptoms improve  some later in the afternoon.

                                                Patient passed out after receiving janssen covid-19 vaccine. There was no injection site reaction, no wheezing, or rash/hives. Patient had vision loss, dilated pupils, sweaty, unable focus or respond to use questions being asked, and  was having trouble hearing-said he had ringing in his ears. We were able to lay him on the floor without injuries-he did not fall. I was fanning him and we were talking to him. He got a little worse but then got better. When he was better, he said that he had passed out before when having blood taken. He did not mention this to me before the vaccine was administered. I do not feel that the Janssen COVID shot was the cause, I think he just passes out from injections or needles. We did call 911 when he was getting worse. By the time they got here, he was better but they did check him.

Received J&amp;J vaccine at 3 weeks ago. His current neurological examination and clinical history is suggestive of GBS  NEUROLOGICAL EXAM:  MSE: A&#43;Ox 3 Language: no aphasia   CRANIAL NERVES:  2nd CN: bilateral pupils are equal round and reaction to light, visual field-full 3rd,4th and 6th CN: EOM-I 5th CN: no sensory deficite 7th CN: face: symmetric, not able to smile or blowing air or holding water 8th CN: hearing loss: no 9, 10th CN: no dysarthria, palate movement:normal 11th CN: no neck weakness 12th CN: tongue: middle, no atrophy   MOTOR EXAM:  Tone: normal  Strength: 4&#43;/5 at bilateral UEs, 4 Pt symptoms started very early. Narrative from family below:  &#34;Day 1 (The day he took the vaccine): My father was complaining of very heavy chest pressure (said he felt like his chest was being pushed down with force.) He felt really tired and had a nasty headache.   Day 2 He began to feel tingles in his legs and arms. Said he felt sore and had mild pain around his back, feet, legs, hands, and arms. The headache came in and out.   Day 3 He began feeling more severe pains in both legs &#43; headache. More tingling around his face, lips, and jaw.  Day 4 Severe pain continued around his entire body. Had an episode where he lost vision from 1 eye (he described it as blurry vision) felt like he was going blind from one eye.  Day 5 Could barely stand on his two feet and could no longer go to work. He stayed in bed and then hospital visits began. My mom took him to emergency for the first time.  I was able to get details of the location where he was vaccinated and onsite contact information. The info is below:

Patient began having some blood in his sputum since this morning at 4AM, and that occurred twice more with intervals of a few hours, both continuously improving and less blood. No other symptoms. No history of TB, no exposure to sick contacts, no recent travel. Unlikely a pulmonary embolus given normal vital signs and no risk factors. Patient was doing outdoor work in his yard for the past few days before the symptom onset and was working on mulch and compost. Although unlikely to have fungal infection currently, may be bacterial pneumonia

I went to see my optometrist who told me I had some sort of allergic reaction. I do not know if the vaccine caused my allergic reaction. My optometrist prescribed eye drops. I had no soreness or pain to my left arm after myvaccine.  Today I still have some clear, thick discharge that is present.

During the night I woke up overheated and bathed in sweat. Got up to go to the bathroom for BM but was nauseous, feeling need to vomit at the same time. After BM I stood and still felt need to  do one or the other or both when I passed out. Wife came upstairs and found me sitting up against the corner wall. She was able to shake me awake while calling 911. I was groggy but aware I was still nauseous and  stayed down next to toilet until stomach settled. I came downstairs and EMTs arrived. Took blood pressure. Result was it was low. Took EKG and that was normal. Second  blood pressure test  showed that I rebounded.  When offered I felt it unnecessary to go to hospital.

Had a 101.5 degree temperature all night which went down to 100 in the morning and back up to 101.2 later on the 14th.  I had nausea and extreme pain all over my body and restlessness.  it got a little better the next day but still feels like I have the flu. I had covid back in march of 2020 and was tested for the antibodies at the end of August.  There is a horrific dearth of research on people who have had covid and whether they should get the vaccines. It is disgraceful, and the next time I will listen to my gut which told me NOT to get vaccinated!

                                                On Thursday, March 18, I had some slight dizziness during the day. After going to bed that night I woke up and the night light in the smoke alarm on the ceiling appeared to be spinning. I sat, then stood, grabbling walls for support and attempted to reach my recliner. At that point I was severely dizzy, completely lost any sense of balance and collapsed into the chair. I could not stand or walk. After 20 minutes, I asked my wife to call an ambulance. I did not think she would be able to get me into our car. The paramedics ran an EKG and tested me for a stroke. Both were normal. I was transported to the ER. The doctor gave me Meclizine. Had a CT scan of my brain, and blood work. All results normal. Dizziness resolved. They tested my balance and then released me at 3:30 a.m. on March 19. I was tired that day, but did not need further medication. During that night, as I turned over in bed, the vertigo returned. I took a Meclizine and went to the recliner for the remainder of the night. I am feeling somewhat fuzzy today, March 20. Not sure how long this will continue, or if it is related to my Covid vaccination. However, I am reporting it in the event that others may be experiencing this problem as well.

Pt also stated he wasn&#39;t having any trouble breaking, skin tone look normal, pt was able to communicate with no problems. He stated the symptoms he was experiencing were something he was used to. It happens to him when he eats chicken  and certain kinds of foods (especially seafood/shellfish). I offered him benadryl and an ice pack while he was here. He refused the ice pack, but did  agree to low dose of benadryl. He took one Allergy Relief 25mg softgel and then continued to set for a little over 30 minutes total before he said he was fine and left with his wife.  I contacted him around 11:50am, he was doing fine and enjoying a good lunch.
