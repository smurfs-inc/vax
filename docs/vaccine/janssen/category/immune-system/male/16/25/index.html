He was back up on his feet and reported feeling normal within 30 seconds. About 5 minutes later he began to have slurred speech, excessive perspiration and reported feeling warm. An ambulance was called and arrived within less that 5 minutes and took over care.

As I was running to him pt started slipping out of his chair, as a women, who I later found out was his mother and I helped keep pt in chair as he fainted and then seized for about 2 seconds and then gained consciousness. Upon awakening pt said , what  just happened?&#34; The mother answered &#34;oh you just had a little seizure, you&#39;re fine.&#34; To my surprise, I asked the mother is this has happened before and she said yes when he sees needles/get shots.  I told them the ambulance was on it&#39;s why and the mother asked &#34;why?!&#34; I told her because your son just fainted/had a seizure and we want to make sure he is ok.  The pt refused to go to the hospital.  I did go back out there and mentioned to them that it is very important to answer questions truthfully any time they are asked as they failed to honestly answer our questions about ever feeling faint after receiving a vaccine. His blood pressure normalized and once the paramedics left so did they.

I fell back asleep and when I woke up the fever had broken and the chills had improved but the soreness and headache remained. I took Tylenol in the afternoon and that helped the symptoms but by the time I had gone to bed the chills had returned but not a fever. When I woke up in the middle of the night (night 2) the chills had stopped and I woke up with a moderate headache and sweating profusely. After falling asleep and awaking in the morning I felt much better with the exception of a minor headache.

The following day (Monday) I felt completely fine and had no adverse symptoms or side effects.

Went home and slept until Wednesday morning. Today, Wednesday, I am still not feeling normal and am having trouble concentrating at work, low light seems to help. No numbness today but still feel dazed and not able to focus

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At 11 PM the night of the vaccine (Saturday), extremely bad chills, fever and weakness set in almost immediately. I could not get my body to warm up and was borderline too weak to walk. Very bad headache and nausea set in as well.  After several hours the chills turned to intermittent sweating/cold and I could not keep a consistent body temp, nor sleep that night. The next morning  (Sunday) I had very bad aches and soreness, along with chills/fever and headaches that could be managed fine with around the clock acetaminophen. Around 8 PM that night, most of these flu like symptoms subsided. The following morning (Monday), still very exhausted despite a full 10 hours sleep. Tiredness and weakness lasted through the day. Tuesday morning until around 3 PM i still experienced drowsiness and was unable to gain strength for anything more than typical day to day tasks (could not workout). Wednesday morning, felt normal but while exercising experienced shortness of breath almost immediately as well as chest/lung pain easily. Come Thursday I feel 90% normal.

                                                I experienced slight nausea the night I received the vaccine. The following morning was miserable. I had a fever of 101 all day long, a headache, my body was aching from head to toe, extreme lethargy, and occasional bouts of extreme nausea as well as throwing up twice. As of the following day (March 18), almost two days since receiving the shot, I feel pretty much completely normal again aside from a slight headache and some pain at the injection site still. I experienced some pretty bad side effects that only really lasted a day.

I gave him some water and a cookie. He said he felt better after consuming the cookie. I had him sit in a chair outside my counseling room and to knock if he continued to feel unwell. After 10 minutes, the patient said he was feeling much improved. I had the patient wait another 20 minutes before leaving. The patient left feeling normal again.

                                                At roughly 6 days after vaccination my body developed Hives head to toe. Roughly 18 or so hours after initial hive development I sought treatment for a anaphylactic reaction in my throat and face area. I received a steroid and a Pepcid to calm it down, and was given an epi pen and sent on my way. The following now two plus weeks since then I&#39;ve had episodes of dizziness, shortness of breath and headaches that seem to be constant. There has been almost no relief from these symptoms, however the rash has completely resided. I&#39;ve taken an Aspirin in the mornings to deal with the headaches but strenuous activity seems to bring these on much more prominently.

                                                Patient stated they didn&#39;t feel well at all and was sweating.  I told him I should give him an Epi Pen, but he preferred receiving generic Benadryl. At approximately 12:50pm he was given 50mg of diphenhydramine since he wasn&#39;t having any swelling to inhibit swallowing. He drank half the bottle of water. He stated his vision was spotty, but getting better. I told him we should give him the epi pen and call 911.  He asked us to call girlfriend to let her know he wasn&#39;t feeling well. After another few minutes he stated his vision was getting better and feeling much better. At 1:12 we took his blood pressure 102/67 pulse of 47.  He stated the pressure and pulse were normal for him since he is a runner.  (He had run a marathon the previous weekend). He was monitored for 30 minutes.  After the 30 minutes, he felt fairly normal and was going to be with someone the rest of the day working at home. He was given more benadryl and advised to seek emergency medical attention if symptoms returned and were worse. Around 7;30pm I called to check on him. He had taken another dose of benadryl 50mg.  He still felt comfortable not seeking er attention since he was going to be with friends the rest of the evening and night.
