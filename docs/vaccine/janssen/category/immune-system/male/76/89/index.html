Patient began to eat after lots of convincing and seemed to be doing at least 20% by week 3, but oxygen was still in mid 80%. On day 20 after vaccine patient had to be rushed to the ER due to sepsis. All vital organs  began to fail and on transport patient suffered a mild heart attack.   Patient was a healthy 78 year old male that lived alone and drove and had no major health issues before the date of the vaccine.

March17, I got sick - I had a bad stomach ache. Friday, I thought the doctors would be gone. March 21st, I went to the clinic and they sent me right to the hospital for a scan and I had emergency surgery to remove my appendix - but it did get put off from when I went in because of all the emergencies in front of me with the ambulances coming in from accidents. He said it had burst  by the time the surgeon got to me with the surgery and they gave me antibiotics and he said he poked three holes in my belly. Still recovering - I have follow up tomorrow. I am doing real well. My stomach doesn&#39;t hurt and I am not taking pain medication any longer.

                                                Patient caregiver reports that he woke up at 2 a.m. the morning after the vaccine unable to hold his urine which is unusual for him.  He also reported extreme acid reflux symptoms whenever he attempted to drink any fluids at that time as well as nausea.  This progressed to difficulty breathing at which time the caregiver was alerted and checked his blood pressure.  This reading was 88/55 according to the caregiver and the pulse was very high as well but the actual number could not be remembered.  The difficulty breathing prompted them to alert emergency medical services where he was picked up and transported to the emergency room via ambulance shortly after for evaluation.

Approx 33 hrs after receiving dose, noticed my eyes were &#34;stinging&#34;, (symptom I have, spring and fall for a day or two each, controlled by Patanol 1 drop ea eye BID. (Did not use the med at this time), although I followed my usual routine of un educated &#34;tears&#34; in the eyes at bedtime and 2x in morning. Awaking next morning found  eye surrounds (lids, ...) were quite puffy, perhaps 1/4 &#34;swollen shut&#34;, eyes still stinging though still not terribly so.  Also noted  morning breath measurements (Peak flow, FEV1, on a hand-held device) were 5-10% lower than normal.   No &#34;sore arm&#34; or other musculature symptoms. At  ~ 50 hours post-vaccine,  am &#34;better&#34;, will now go  use some Patanol.

                                                As soon as I started to inject vaccine into arm patient arm started to swell and get a welt at injection sight. I finished injecting vaccine but by the time I finished the welt was about 1.5 inches in diameter and about a 1/4 inch thick. Notified provider and he looked at it and stated it was a local reaction and stated to patient to watch it and put ice on it when he got home. He also told patient if he had any other side effects to come in to clinic or go to ER.
