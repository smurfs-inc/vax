                                                Went most of the day with no symptoms. Performed a High Intensity Workout around 7pm for an hour, and ate shortly after. Took a hot shower and relaxed before bed time around 10pm started to have a headache. By 10:45 when I went to sleep it was an intense headache. Under the covers my body was incredibly hot, without covers I was freezing cold. I woke up around midnight in a sweat and again around 2:30am when I called in sick to work. I then sat in my bathroom for 30 minutes, threw up once, and then feeling much better (Still had an intense headache) I drank some water and fell back asleep in my room. Today is the second day, I have a small headache, have not eaten all day, and slept most of the afternoon. I highly recommend not working out the same day of getting the vaccine, I didn&#39;t think to ask about that when I received it. I doubt I would have had this problem if I rested instead.

Took acetaminophen and covered up with blankets and drank water. Took a couple hour nap and woke up sweating with terrible migraine and light body shakes. Fell asleep for a few more hours and woke up not feeling feverish, but migraine and body aches. 22 hours after onset I have a light headache and body aches and am mostly feeling recovered.

About 5 minutes after vaccination, another patient came over and said that was not feeling well. When going out to patient I noticed he was very pale and sweating.  The patient then proceeded to pass out. I was able to hold the patients head and the other customer was able to hold his shoulders to make sure he did not fall out of the chair. The patient then got very stiff and proceeded to push back in his chair, after about 10 seconds he relaxed. The patient was passed out for about 3 mins, during that time I was able to remove his mask and hold his head. After gaining consciousness, I was able to make sure he was ok. We were able to give him some water and he stated he felt better. I asked the patient to stay for another half hour to monitor. After giving the patient another bottle of water, and having him sit he was able to get up and leave.

I went back and checked on him after 5mins of waiting, then came back to the pharmacy. But heard a big bang shortly after. Some how, he had fallen out of his chair and bumped his head and neck on an end camp. He seemed a little confused, when I ran over, but was awake, a little sweaty and nauseated. EMS was called. They transported him to ER to have his head checked, since he bumped it.

I drank a ton of fluids, used OTC treatments (Ibuprofen and Motrin) but nothing alleviated the pain. By 10 am I had a sustained fever over 100 degrees. I was in so much pain I was crying in bed. By 3 pm my fever reached 102 degrees. I had to go to the emergency room for IV drip and medication because I couldn&#39;t drink enough water to stay hydrated. Once given IV, my temperature plummeted. When the medication they administered wore off, my body started experiencing mild to moderate pains again. Body aches and soreness all over- my muscles feel like they are being squeezed from the inside. I am still feeling a lot of fatigue and pain but it is random and comes and goes along with &#34;hot flashes&#34;.

Noticed increased restlessness and increased discomfort. Took 400 mg ibuprofen and after ~30 minutes there was a gradual decrease in symptoms, particularly fever and dyspnea. Symptoms resolved after taking ibuprofen. 24 hours following initial symptoms onset, noted to have fever (101 degrees), achiness return, face was flush, and transient chills/sweats.

At 6:35, he said he had left arm weakness (arm he received vaccine in), fatigue, was dizzy, and felt &#34;off&#34;.  Patient did not lose consciousness and refused an ice pack.  BP checked at 6:38pm (170/98, pulse 105).  Patient stated his blood pressure usually runs high. I offered him an ice pack a second time, but he said there was no need and he felt better.  BP checked again 6:52pm (152/101, pulse 99).  I recommended that since his blood pressure is usually this high, he should follow up with his primary doctor regarding blood pressure as he may need some medication to assist in lowering it.  He said ok.  He left the pharmacy area at 7:02pm and said he was fine to leave, he did not want to remain any longer.

No signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis were identified so the patient was observed and monitored.  The patient then became unconscious for approximately 10-15 seconds with small jerking movements identified during this time. 911 was called and the patient was monitored until EMS arrived.  Epinephrine was prepared and ready during this whole time but was not administered because the patient didn&#39;t show symptoms of anaphylaxis (trouble breathing or talking, trouble swallowing, hives, flushing etc).  The  time from vaccine administration to EMS arrival was approximately 20-25 minutes.   The patient was able to talk and communicate clearly the entire time except during the brief unconscious period.

Within 5-10 minutes, I was sitting in the car and sending a text and with no warning whatsoever mid-text lost consciousness, profuse sweating, wheezing, lost color in my skin, was making unintelligible noises, and eventually woke up about a minute later but couldn&#39;t speak or comprehend those speaking to me (according to my wife who was terrified).  I was not nervous, stressed, or scared of receiving a vaccine. I regained the ability to speak about a minute later and my wife had summoned the staff on the scene who instructed me to lie back and breathe without a mask. I drank some liquids. A nurse was called over and offered to take my vital signs but I decided I felt ok enough not to. Eventually my normal skin color and came back and sweating stopped after about 5 minutes. We sat for a few extra minutes and once I felt it was past me,  my wife drove us home.

The fourth and fifth day my lips and face would become tingly/numb and my left arm would get weak and I would feel a little disoriented, my sleep has been pretty disturbed. It felt like I was having a stroke. I did not have a stroke,  I continue to occasionally feel the above symptoms, a little less potent than they were, they might be going away, I can&#39;t tell. I will be calling my doctor if it continues.

Slept until 11:15pm and woke up to violent shivering, pounding headache, full body aches, sore skin, achey joints, nausea, swelling tongue and throat. Took 1 dose of nyquil and then tossed and turned all night, very little sleep, symptoms persisted into the next day, but shivering stopped in the night. By morning (3-14) registered a fever of 100.3 which persisted most of the day along with remaining lessening symptoms. By evening I was still very sore, bad headache, and very lethargic/fatigued. Next morning (3-15) low temp of 97.1 degrees, headache, fatigue, lightheaded. Still feel headachy and tired.

This lasted for about 12 hours and I woke up with a slight fever which then subsided. Later the following day I felt fine again.   Essentially, when the symptoms were most intense, I felt like I did when I contracted Covid in March of 2020

About 10 minutes later I was notified someone wasn&#39;t doing well. I went to the patient and he was hunched down and looked pale and he stated he was very dizzy. I asked him if he had trouble breathing and he stated he had not. He appeared like he was about to pass out, I was asking him questions about his state and he wasn&#39;t being coherent. I told him I was going to give an EpiPen and call 911. I gave him the EpiPen in his outer thigh. EMS came 5 minutes later.  A few hours later I got a call from a close by asking if I had given him a Benadryl because he was feeling drowsy. I asked his status and the nurse stated he was doing fine.

Within just a few seconds following him calling for help he was not able to talk and his eyes had rolled into the back of his head. His body was rigid but he did not lose consciousness. A technician called 911.  He was sweating profusely so his jacket was removed and a cold rag applied to his head. He finally came to after approximately 1-2 minutes and reported that he was feeling very dizzy. His blood pressure was 118/80 and temperature was 98.5 degrees Fahrenheit. He was examined by an EMT, and they found a very similar blood pressure.  Patient reported feeling much better and was fine to go home. Treatment occurred over a 15 minute window.

Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the injection, I started to feel faint, lightheaded, nausea, and clammy. I informed a member of the staff and several medical personnel came to assist. They laid me down on a cot and checked my vitals. I started to feel better after laying down. The staff took my blood pressure and heart rate readings, which were relatively normal. But after sitting me up and taking my vitals again, my blood pressure and heart rate spiked. I was taken to Hospital in an ambulance; however, after waiting in the ER waiting room for about 2.5 hours, I left without seeing a doctor. During those 2.5 hours my original symptoms did not return, so I elected to leave.

                                                CPT administered Janssen COVID-19 vaccine to the pt 4/5. While sitting in the pharmacy area for his 15 minute observation period, he fainted. He said that he was texting on his phone and the next thing he knew, he was on the ground with people around him asking if he was ok. He stated that he was very sweaty, nauseous, and a little dizzy. We called a code white, provided the pt with a cold compress and elevated his feet. Pt did not want us to call 911. Pt did not have PCP and has not been to a doctor in about 5 years. He said he was very nervous getting the shot and is afraid of needles so that may have contributed. Pt stayed in the pharmacy area for about 45 minutes until he started to feel better and his mom came to get him. I tried calling pt again at 7:10pm to check in, but there was no answer and I could not leave a voicemail due to mailbox being full.

About 10 hours later body began to feel warm and then within an hour began uncontrollable shivers and aching in testicles followed shortly after by a throbbing headache and pain behind eyeballs. I put on extra clothing and jumped into bed as symptoms persisted. Later in the night I began sweating profusely and removed the clothing. The headache and pain behind the eyes persisted. I also began feeling nauseous and almost vomited when I went to the bathroom. My body was so tired and achy I could barely move. I tried to wake up for work but my headache and pain behind the eyes was so bad I went back to bed for another four hours. I did not have any appetite for the rest of the day.  My headache subsided that afternoon and I went for a walk that night and my body still felt incredibly tired and achy. The pain behind my eyes persisted. The following day I felt somewhat better and could work. That night I went for a jog and my body felt extremely heavy, my joints ached, and I could not catch my breath. My symptoms continued to improve but I have had no sex drive for a week.

                                                I had my Johnson and Johnson vaccine around 10:30am and felt fine throughout the day.   Went to work, had a 40 min workout, and had dinner with friends (had one drink and a cigarette) .  I was in bed by 9pm and with in a few min started to get chills.  By 9:30pm I was in  sweating, shaking, headache, and had extreme body aches.  I struggled to get out of bed to use the restroom, any movement was painful.  I didn&#39;t get much sleep due to the body aches.  By 8am my symptoms began to fade.  I felt fatigued and had a headache by noon.

The EMS was called but the patient declined being taken to the hospital as he felt much better by the time they arrived.

                                                As expected from any vaccine I&#39;ve received, I have a sore arm that is lasting over 3 days (again, this is expected). What I wasn&#39;t quite expecting: -Fever at 101 for 48 hours -Extreme fatigue for 48 hours -Alternating chills and hot flashes/sweating for 48 hours -Quite strong aches and pains (hurt to lay down, sit, stand, just existing hurt) for 48 hours -Headache for 48 hours -Itchy/sore throat around the 24 hour mark, lasting to the 36 hour mark from time of injection  Treatment: I took 400 mg of Ibuprofen around the 12 hour mark from vaccination (about 5 hours after fever spiked at 101--fever rose no higher than 101). I continued 400 mg of Ibuprofen the next morning and once more that same evening (two does of 400 mg Ibuprofen). Each of those doses brought fever down to around 99 for about 4 hours, and I felt considerably better (though definitely still quite sick--just not contained-to-lying-in-bed sick). I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen around the 36 hour mark, and that was it. Fever then back to normal range (approx 98) and feeling 95%-100% recovered all day.  Obviously none of those are life-threatening, but they sure knocked me out. Definitely way worse than the &#34;mild&#34; symptoms advertised. I&#39;m definitely not complaining, as I&#39;m overjoyed to now be vaccinated, and I&#39;m so grateful for the scientific community, the CDC, and you people reading this right now for all your work in making it happen, and doing it as safely as possible. Thank you!

Upon standing up from the laying down position, I got lightheaded, started profusely sweating, became nauseous and ultimately lost consciousness. When I regained my consciousness, there was a loud ringing in my ears and my hands were numb. I took some Tylenol, laid down and it subsided shortly after. I did not experience any symptoms as severe as this at any point again.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the injection, I became dizzy and lightheaded. My  eyesight became blurry and my hearing very &#34;tinny&#34;. I felt nausea and  thought I was going to throw up. I sat down in a chair and was given a granola bar and some water. After about 3 or 4 minutes the majority of these  seemed to fade, but I still felt slightly &#34;off&#34;. Approximately 9pm that evening I felt very fatigued, so I went to bed. At approximately midnight, I woke up shivering, extremely cold, and sweating. Around 2am I had a fever of 102.3. I took some Tylenol to try to bring my fever down, which seemed to help. Around 9am the next morning my fever was gone, though I still felt extremely fatigued.  Later that evening, after several naps, I started to feel a little better. Most of these adverse events were resolved by 28 hours after injection. I had arm soreness at the injection sight that felt like having been punched in the arm for about a week after the injection.

I was laying in bed with a hoodie and sweat pants on and could not stop shaking from being cold. Then 30 mins later I was so hot I had to take everything off. It kept going on like that till the next morning. I just now started to feel better around 10 am the next day.

I went to check on him and he was yellowish in color and barely able to speak to me. I asked another pharmacist to get me a cold pack and water. By the time we got the cold pack and water, he was not speaking, but eyes were open. I called 911 and the other pharmacist fanned him and placed the cold pack on his head and neck. He started talking within minutes and we waited for ambulance to come just to check him out. He was ablet to verify his name and where he was and EMSA came at 3:50pm. He left to their truck and said he was okay just felt shaky and clammy, but he could hear everyone talking to him.

I had a fever of 102 and spend the rest of the evening in bed, shaking. By around 10 PM the severe chills had subsided and my fever was 101.  I did not sleep much during the night due to a headache and alternating chills/sweating. This morning it is 7 AM and my temperature is 99.5 and I am beginning to feel more normal. I took advil at first and then tylenol every 4 hours during the night.

                                                Patient went into a vasovagal response with sweating about 8 minutes after the shot. patient came back to consciousness after 7 seconds after pharmacist checked pulse made sure the patient was upright and used applied tension technique. Patient was then given fluids and lime soda that helped the patient come back to total consciousness. We continued to monitor patient for an extra 30 minutes and called family to pick him to ensure that he does not drive. Moreover, I recommended that the patient does not go snowboarding as he was thinking of heading to the mountains today.

Felt like I was going to be knocked out for 24 hours. I can hardly do these basic task on my work laptop.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  First day after getting the shot I got a feeling of being very tired throughout the day I did not feel like to do anything. Also my arm was very very sore. Even moving it slightly a bit would hurt. The second day is when things got way worse I could not really sleep that well throughout the night because I noticed I had  body aches in my legs and my back. Throughout that day I also felt like I had a fever in the morning I took my temperature and had a 100 fever. At night time I took my temperature and it went up to 102, with  still a bad headache, chills, and body aches throughout my legs mostly. I also felt some palpitations. When I went to bed I was sweating very prefusively all night that I had to change my shirt. On the third day I felt a lot better, still with a slight headache no fever, and still feeling like im sweating on and off.

                                                2 hours after receiving the vaccine I began to feel hot and cold flashes and a flush feeling as if I was going to faint. I went to the emergency room. The ER doctor did blood work, took my blood pressure (a little high at first) and EKG. Doctor said everything appeared to be fine. After I left the hospital I started feeling mild shortness of breath and tightness in my chest which has not stopped as of this writing. I also have moderate pain in the upper middle part of my back by the vertebrate.

                                                Patient received vaccine around 3PM CST and proceeded to waiting area for the recommended waiting time. Within a few minutes of receiving the vaccination, around 3:05PM CST, patient complained of feeling dizzy. Patient was carefully laid down on the floor, given a pillow to protect his head, and feet were elevated. Patient was extremely sweaty and lightheaded/dizzy. Patient maintained consciousness and expressed that he was beginning to feel a bit better once he was lying down. He was provided a cold bottle of water if needed. Patient refused dispatching an ambulance, which I believed to be an acceptable option as he was already improving and never lost consciousness. A blood pressure cuff was obtained and his blood pressure was 138/94 pulse 69 at approximately 3:15PM EST. He did not know what his BP typically is, but I felt comfortable that he wouldn&#39;t likely pass out with this BP. He wanted to set up due to feeling better, so we cautiously helped him do so. After having him remain seated on the ground out of caution, he requested to stand up. He stated he was feeling much better and expressed at that point he wanted to leave. His girlfriend was with him and would be driving him home. It seemed that his symptoms had fully resolved by the time he left the waiting area and assured me he felt okay.

Around 30-40 minutes later, I began experiencing a reaction I&#39;m not prone to.  I had severe heartburn throughout most of the night and my lips began to swell which made me mistakenly assume I have had a cardiac event. While in the morning the pain had subsided, the numbness in the lips hadn&#39;t and I went to the ER thinking it might&#39;ve been a heart issue. No cardiac condition was noted at the hospital which leads me to believe I may have had a severe allergic reaction to foods or environmentals I&#39;ve never had reactions to.

One nurse raised his legs &amp; another put a pulse oximeter on patient &amp; took his BP. Patient started responding to verbal cues. A nurse gave him Gatorade to start drinking. He was drenched in sweat from head to feet. The nurse continued to take his BP, which did hit 120/~70, but then dipped again. Once his BP &amp; pulse stabilized, he was able to go home. Patient ate a full meal &amp; a non-diet soda. He reported being exhausted ~4 pm. He fell asleep &amp; rose once to urinate.  Dr. at a Family Medicine practice checked his heart and lungs, and confirmed this did not appear to be an allergic reaction, but more likely was a vagovasal reaction. Patient started reacting ~10 minutes after the injection.

Then he started felling better after that and he said it happened before during his MRI and other procedure.  EMT team accessed his vital signs and symptoms inside their vehicle and finally released him home. His family took him home

I gave him some water to drink and mountain dew, and I had him lay on his back for several minutes. The patient said he felt better and more alert after laying on the floor. After 10 minutes, I had him sit back up, he was feeling much improved. After 10 more minutes, he wanted to get a snack before he left. I requested he come back after the snack just to check in on him after he had walked around. The patient left the pharmacy feeling normal again.

                                                I received my vaccine this morning at 6:12AM and felt fine after. Around 7:45AM I started to feel slightly short of breathe, but figured it was just from the cold outside and my Asthma. The shortness of breathe feeling goes away. Later in the day sometime after 3 PM, I start to feel as if I am getting stuffy. I take a nap on the buss on my way home, and when I wake up I suddenly feel like I am freezing and have chills all throughout my body. I get home and jump in a hot shower to warm up, but it did not help. I then heat up some food to eat dinner, and I go to drink some soda, and I notice I have no taste. I figured the soda was flat, but even flat soda has some taste to it. I then drink a Cherry Gatorade, and still no taste. Now I check my temperature and it is at 101.4, and I have a slight cough.

I couldn&#39;t palm a ball i had for the kids which i normally can easily.  I had chills and nausea as well.    I can&#39;t really remember much from that day and it feels like a big blur.  I woke up the next day feeling very irritable with brain fog.  Today its gotten better and I am hoping tomorrow I will be back to normal.

                                                Patient came in for Janssen COVID vaccine that was scheduled electronically online.  All appropriate prescreening was done and patient had no previous allergies or issues.  Patient was instructed to sit in one of the chairs designated for post vaccine observation.  Within minutes (less than 3), patient was very dizzy, clammy (cold sweats), pale and said he did not feel right.  I assisted him to a sitting position on the floor from his chair and we were able to ease him back to a lying down position from there with his head on the floor and feet elevated above heart on a chair.  Patient said that the cold floor actually made him feel better instantly.  At 4:18pm after lying down for about 3 minutes we checked his blood pressure with him still lying down.  It was 110/88 and pulse of 104 (so slightly elevated pulse).  He said he was feeling better and we kept him lying down.  Patient&#39;s wife was also there so she was able to provide information in addition to him doing it also.  She did state that he occasionally had panic attacks and she thought this might be one, the patient was adamant that it was not.  At 4:24 pm we checked his blood pressure again and it was 100/90 and Pulse of 104.  He was feeling quite a bit better so we had him come to a sitting position on the floor and he had not eaten in a while so we got him a granola bar and water.  Pt slowly ate these and begin to feel clammy and sweaty again within 3-4 minutes. We checked his blood pressure again and it was 104/90 and pulse of 100.  He wanted to stay sitting to see if it would pass.  We did continuously observe injection site and screen for any other symptoms of an allergic reaction (nausea, cramping, swelling, and none of these were occurring). Since he was still not feeling well we gave the patient 50mg of benadryl (20 mls of 12.5mg/5ml liquid benadryl) with his approval. After about 10 minutes of sitting total he was still having cold sweats and feeling dizzy so we had him lie back on his back with his feet elevated while the benadryl kicked in.  By 4:50pm he was feeling well enough to sit back up and we got him some wraps and a coke from the cafe to eat.  Pt continued to consistently improve and was ready to leave about 5:20pm.  We advised him and his wife of signs and symptoms of allergic reaction and to have those treated to immediately at urgent care or and ER.   We also told him to follow-up with his PCP.  I had a manager help walk them to their car.  They were very kind and grateful.  I will follow-up with a call tomorrow and again on Friday to make sure he continues to do well.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received my dose at 3pm on March 12, and experienced no adverse events until about 5 or 6 hours later. Between 8pm and 9pm, I felt a bit tired, though wasn?t sure it was vaccine-related at first. However, I shortly afterwards started feeling much more tired, and experienced chills and shivering. I went to sleep. My wife later said I felt very warm, though we did not measure my temperature.  During the night, at one point, I got up to go to the bathroom, and became very dizzy and nearly fell over, though I was able to catch myself and did not experience any fall or injury.   I went back to bed. At some other point during the night, I started sweating. My wife later said I felt cold at that point.  For most of the following day, Saturday, March 13, I no longer felt dizzy nor overly hot or cold, but had a migraine and mild nausea. I did not vomit, but I also ate very little during the day. I did eat a little in the morning, and had some water throughout the day. For the most part, I laid in bed, drifting in and out of sleep.   At about 7pm on March 13, I took two Tylenol to try to fight the headache. By 8pm I felt almost completely better. I ate more bits of food, and have felt fine since then. Sunday, I woke up and felt back to normal. I ate normally as well.

Then progressed to severe shaking chills, fevers, headaches, tingling/electric shock feeling in back of head/neck, muscle aches, mild joint pain, eye discomfort associated with the headaches, poor appetite at first, trouble sleeping, and fatigue; all of which required doses of Tylenol and ibuprofen and cold packs. Symptoms lasted all night and fever broke overnight after finally falling asleep. The next day (3/17) took some more Tylenol and ibuprofen, but the fever and chills subsided. The other symptoms mostly resolved except was still quite tired and felt weak. Also, had cold sweats all day on 3/17. By around 3/18 most all of the symptoms resolved.  Also, had mild soreness at vaccination site throughout.  I?m a physician. If I wasn?t a physician I may have sought medical attention.

                                                Seven days after vaccine was administered Patient started having symptoms of difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, and breaking out in a rash all over  his torso and upper arms.  His lips also got quite swollen.  The rash eventually spread down both his legs.  He was taken to the emergency room at Hospital, as he was visiting there at the time.  He was given benadryl, and prednisone once his Covid test came back negative.  Blood work, chest x-ray, CT scan of both stomach and chest, EKG and blood work all came back normal.  His resting heart rate was 120 and above, and he required two liters of oxygen to stay in the mid 90&#39;s saturation level.  He spent five days in the hospital before the rash was mostly faded on his torso and his lip swelling had come down.  He was discharged on 3/24/21 with the advice to see his primary care physician, and to be monitored carefully for oxygen saturation and heart rate.  The family could not think of anything he had eaten or come in contact with that would have caused any reaction.  At this time we think it was a reaction to his Janssen vaccine based on all the tests at the hospital coming back normal.

They took him to the hospital for further observation.

                                                About 9 hours after receiving the vaccine I began developing flu-like symptoms, which quickly escalated. Within a couple of hours I developed a very high fever (which peaked at 104.1 and hovered around 102-103), body-wracking cold chills, extreme lethargy and body aches. The only thing that kept my fever down was 1,000mg of Tylenol every 6 hours, with a cold compress on my head. The symptoms were less severe but still substantial by the following day. On the second night after receiving the vaccine (Monday the 8th) I had nightsweats, but then woke up on the morning of Tuesday the 9th feeling almost completely back to normal. The only other strange thing to happen was waking up today on Thursday the 11th with a giant fever blister on my lip, which I suppose could be attributed to an immune system in temporary disarray or overdrive. I am still very grateful for the vaccine and would do it again, but it was very scary that first night on Sunday the 7th. I don&#39;t remember the last time I felt that sick.

My blood pressure went up to 210/138 which is extremely abnormal for me. I began to tremor uncontrollably. I thought it was an anxiety attack so I took my Xanax. .50mg. That did not work at all. I experienced nausea and stomach pain. I called 911 and was taken to the hospital where after 4 hours I started feeling better. Tuesday I continued to have tremors. Wednesday the rapid heart rate, stomach pain, and nausea returned. The rest of the week did not get any better. On Saturday 3/27 I slept all day long which again is not normal for me at all. At this point we are 1 full week into the vaccine administration. On Sunday 3/28 I bagan to have the same feeling as the prior Tuesday. Sweating, couldn&#39;t breath, heart rate hit 170 this time. BP was the same, tremors, stomach pain, nausea, dizzyness, and this time my Carbon Dioxide level dropped to 24. This morning 3/29 I woke up with extreme tremors. No dizzyness.

                                                BEFORE GIVING THE JANSSEN COVID VACCINE (LOT # 1805025 EXP 5/25/21), THE PATIENT HAD STATED THAT THE LAST FEW TIMES HE GOT A SHOT OR HAD A BLOOD DRAW HE GOT REALLY SICK AND EVEN PASSED OUT. THE VACCINE WAS GIVEN WITHOUT INCIDENT AND PATIENT SAID HE FELT OK. HE TRADED PLACES WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AND SAT IN A CHAIR IN THE EXAM ROOM. IT WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER I HAD ALREADY GIVEN HIS GIRLFRIEND HER VACCINE THAT HE SAID THAT HE WAS FEELING FUNNY. HIS COLORING CHANGED AND HE WAS DIAPHORETIC. I GOT A PAPERTOWEL WITH COOL WATER ON IT AND PLACED ON HIS NECK AND ANOTHER ONE FOR HIS FOREHEAD. AFTER A MINUTE OR SO, HE DID PASS OUT WHILE IN THE CHAIR. HE WAS OUT FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS AND THEN CAME BACK TO AND WAS ALERT AND ORIENTED X 4 BUT STILL FELT VERY WEAK. I GAVE HIM A WATER TO SIP ON. HIS GIRLFRIEND STAYED AT HIS SIDE THE WHOLE TIME. HIS O2 WAS 100% AND HIS PULSE 53. HE SAID THAT HE HAD EATEN SHORTLY BEFORE COMING TO GET HIS VACCINE BUT THEN LATER ASKED FOR AN APPLE BECAUSE HE WAS ON A CLEANSE DIET AND REALLY HAD NOT EATTEN MUCH. THE PCT WENT TO GET HIM AN APPLE. AFTER EATING THE APPLE AND SITTING FOR AN ADDITIONAL 20 MIN HE FELT WELL ENOUGH TO LEAVE. STILL WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AND HIS GIRLFRIEND COMMITTED TO DRIVING HIM SO HE DID NOT HAVE TO. HE LEFT WITH NO ASSISTANCE.

                                                Pt had history of anaphylaxis related to bee stings. We asked if he had ever had a reaction to another vaccine and he said no. Pt came up saying he wasn&#39;t feeling well during the observation period, within about 5-10 minutes after receiving the vaccination. He look very pale and clammy. I asked if he was ok and he shook his head. Tried to grab a chair for him and he started to collapse. With some help I was able to get him to the ground without injury. We called 911 and I grabbed an epipen. I tried to assess the patient, and he was unable to tell me if he was having any trouble breathing or if his lips/mouth/tongue was swelling. He was conscious but couldn&#39;t speak coherently. I administered the epipen to his right lateral thigh due to his history of anaphylaxis with bee stings. We were able to lay him down while waiting for the ambulance. His color started to return and he was able to respond to questions, but was still slightly confused. He did tell me at this point that he has had similar reactions after vaccines and blood work. The paramedics arrived and took the patients vitals and took him to the hospital.

I looked at my toes and noticed they were turning very pale.  One minute later the bottoms of my feet started turning yellow and within one more minute the bottoms of my feet souls were completely yellow. I have never had this reaction before. It was shocking and looked like I had stepped in yellow paint.
