My hands and feet went numb and I started sweating all over. I felt sick to my stomach and I felt like I was above the whole situation-- I could hear the people talking but I felt like I was somewhere else. After resting my head on the table for about 10 minutes I felt better and was able to move to a cot where I rested for another 20 minutes or so until I felt pretty much back to normal. I was treated by the medical team at the site who cleared me to go home.

Her symptoms included dizziness, syncope, stomach ache, foaming at the mouth, vision disturbances.  911 was called and paramedics arrived..  Her vital signs were all normal.  Patient did not wish to go to hospital, and her mother took her home.  Other pertinent information is that patient has a history of seizures and had been off of her seizure medication for 4 weeks.  I believe that I understood her mother to say that her neurologist knew she was getting the vaccine today.  Patient reported no allergies to any other vaccine, medication, or other.

About half an hour after that, had a bout of vomiting, loss of vision for about 10 seconds after standing up from bed (possibly associated with undiagnosed iron deficiency), and paleness of skin and mucous membranes.

                                                Roughly six hours after receiving the vaccine, I began to get the chills, and I couldn&#39;t stop shaking. Roughly an hour to an hour and a half later, the chills/shaking stopped, only to be replaced by a fever. My temperature shot up, my ears began to ring, and my head began to pound. When I tried to eat, I felt sick to my stomach.   My fever lasted for the entire evening, and I spent most of the night alternating between chills and heat flashes. My head continued to pound, and whenever I tried to sit up, I felt dizzy. At around 4am, I awoke with an upset stomach, diarrhea, and further dizziness.   By around 8-9am, my fever had subsided, and I was beginning to feel a bit better. However, I have been feeling physically drained and a little achy today (03/26).

Now both ears were swollen and the area in my face was red. When I took my temperature on my forehead I was normal however the swollen cheek was 102 degrees. At that point I went to urgent care to get it looked out.  Currently at 6:30pm on 4/3/2021 the redness in my cheek has turn back to normal however the face is still swollen but not as bad.

When EMS responded, she had normal blood pressure and blood sugar, but was still feeling &#34;out of it&#34;.  She was place on a stretcher and taken to the ambulance, but did not get transported.  She had a family member pick her up from the clinic.  She was able to walk from the ambulance to the car on her own.

Patient was given a cold compress for the back of her neck, some peanut butter crackers to eat and water to drink. She had not eaten anything today with the exception of candy and coffee. Feet and legs were elevated and patient began to regain some color in her face and started feeling better after a few minutes.

When observing her, she appeared like she was going to fall over so I had her mom help me put her on her back. 911 was called and I took her blood pressure and it was 80/49 mmHg. She remained conscious and EMS took her to ED for observation. She was given liquids, discharged and told to come back if she had any other symptoms. Per her mother, she had not ate or drank anything prior to receiving the shot.

It started off with a slight headache and body aches with pain in my injection spot. My whole body started to shiver uncontrollably. My body aches focused on my spine and I started to become dizzy and nauseous. Around 4:00 am, the worst migraine, I have ever had that encased my whole head, lasted for about 12 hours with hot flashes. After the migraine, my body and head is sensitive to rapid motion and loud noises.

                                                Within the hour after receiving shot, migraine formed along with fatigue. Both progressively got worse through out that day(4/7/21). On 4/8/21 I woke up many times through out the night with a migraine that felt as though my brain was burning and sinus pressure, causing immense eye sensitivity. Throughout the night I became increasingly more sweaty, but didn?t have the proper thermometer to take my temperature.  I took ibuprofen (at 6:45 AM on 4/8/21) which helped those two side effects subside (around 8 AM). Fatigue has been constant throughout both days. Around 5:00 PM on 4/8/21 I ate broccoli and rice for dinner, small amounts, and encountered bad diarrhea. It lasted for about half an hour. Migraine is reduced significantly (at 6:41 PM), but there is slight nausea, weakness, and fatigue.

I took ibuprofen at 8:00pm. That night at about 9:00 my fever was 100.8 and I felt extreme fatigue.  I woke up at 3:30am feeling both extremely hot and cold with a bad headache and my temperature was 101.5. I took ibuprofen again at 3:30am. I then woke up at 5:15 am with a horrible headache and was very hot and sweating. I put cold compresses on my forehead and back of my neck which helped. The entire night, my arm with the injection site was very painful and stiff to move.

Moments after (less than 2 minutes) giving her the vaccine, I was giving another family member the injection and patient asked if she could take her mask off. I turned around and she was very pale. She took her mask off and started slumping in her seat. She was taking deep breaths and reported no difficulties breathing. She then became ill and began gagging, at which point I gave her the trash receptacle to vomit in. I had a technician grab the patient a water and packet of crackers. After half an hour of resting in the chair, monitoring her breathing, blood pressure, heart rate, and getting some food and water into her system, she appeared and reported to feel back to normal. Patient&#39;s family member mentioned she had a similar reaction a few weeks ago when getting blood drawn at her doctor&#39;s office.

We called 9-1-1 to check vitals and they recommended going to her doctor or the hospital in case of additional swelling.  We called the doctor and they told us to try Benadryl.  This worked a little bit, but she is still in a lot of discomfort today (Saturday after Thursday shot).

                                                2-3 days following the vaccine, a series of small hives appeared along the left side of body.  Specifically on the left shoulder and left hip. They appear as small bug bites and are very itchy. They are hot to the touch and only slightly risen.   Additionally, at around 10 hours following the vaccine, I experienced severe muscle aches and chills (but this was listed as a typical side effect).

                                                I have chronic tension headaches and yesterday my headache wouldn&#39;t go away even with over the counter medication. I felt overall achy but still able to get up and do what I needed to do. Once I went to bed though, I woke up around 2:00a sweating, achy, and with a fever. I couldn&#39;t fall back asleep very easily and once I woke up around 7:00a I confirmed I had a fever. I am currently still bedridden with a fever, complete body aches, and slight feelings of nausea. As of right now it is 8:56a 04/06/21 and the symptoms haven&#39;t gotten any better. I haven&#39;t taken any medication since 04/05/21 at 6:15p ish, which was to treat my headache from yesterday.

The symptoms progressed over the next several minutes and were not improving. Store management was called to the pharmacy as a precaution. After about 10 minutes, the patient stated her symptoms were improving. At that time, she agreed to walk to a waiting chair outside the pharmacy and was watched by pharmacy staff for the next 25-30 minutes. She said she felt fully back to normal by the time she left with the person she came with (her mom).

The chills lasted for around 4 hours, and eventually my fever went away with it. I shook so hard my back, and my joints started to ache. I couldn&#39;t sleep because I was having hallucinations from the fever and the pain would wake me up every hour, I also had a headache. The next day my back still hurts, my head still hurts despite medication, the shaking has subsided. Yet I&#39;m sweating, I&#39;m still very weak, I can&#39;t stand up without getting super dizzy or experiencing extreme fatigue. If I think of food I feel as if I&#39;m going to vomit just drinking too much water can make me ill.

I had a bad headache and was achy, which I know were listed as possible side effects. A few hours later, I started to have a severe burning sensation all over my body. It felt similar to the sensation when your skin gets extremely sensitive to any touch, but was magnified 10x over, and was over every inch of my body. There was no rash, and I did not have a chill as though I had a fever, although my skin was warm to the touch. I took 2 500 mg tablets of extra-strength Tylenol, and the symptoms did not improve at all.

Took more ibuprofen to tame. Went to bed around midnight. Woke up at 10:30am feeling miserable. Very bad cold chills, painful headache, and body aches. I took Dayquil and covered up with lots of blankets and went back to sleep. Did not sleep well and sweated off the blankets. Woke up at 1:30pm feeling slightly better. The rest of the day I experienced mild headaches and slight chills in the evening.

                                                Originally, I started with random muscle aches in my left shoulder then it went down my back (a few hours after receiving vaccine). Then slightly fogginess and at night the muscle pain became worse making it difficult to sleep and started getting cold flashes. Once asleep around 12:30 I started getting muscle aches that felt like they were burning and in random spots on body along with a headache and would get random cold and heat flashes. Kept yelling out in pain all night and increased tremors in hands. Boyfriend noticed I had a fever as well and gave me ibuprofen around 3am since pain was unbearable and was difficult to sleep. Almost took me to the hospital due to the intense pain.. In morning slightly better but still frontal lobe pain and aches throughout body with raised heart rate. Cannot do much or else aches get worse including headache.

                                                About 10 hours after vaccine, began to feel tired and fatigued and nauseous.  Then I developed a fever and sore muscles.  It progressed to the point where I needed assistance walking.  I had extreme chills with uncontrollable shivering and muscle spasms.  I felt very cold though I was burning up and sweating profusely.  I went to sleep and woke up a few hours later with no fever but very sore muscles.  When I woke up in the morning, I felt like nothing had happened, I was just a bit groggy.

                                                Patient received Covid 19 Janssen vaccine, about 10 minutes after administration patient started to get really hot. We applied cold clothes to the neck and head and patient felt like she was going to vomit so we also gave her a bag just in case she got sick. She started looking very pale so we layed patient on floor. She started to panic that she wasn&#39;t going to go to work and eyes were rolling in the back of head. Called 911 for patient and I stayed with patient, I took her blood pressure which was normal. Patient became fully alert again and stated she was feeling a little better. The ems checked her blood pressure and blood sugar and released the patient.

                                                Around 10pm on 3/26, I got a slight headache, but I am not sure if it was due to screen time or a vaccine side effect. Per the clinician that administered the shot, I took 2 tabs of Tylenol (one normal adult dose) with water and went to bed. At 1 am on 3/27, I woke up incredibly sore all over but especially in my joints. I was shivering badly and woke up in a tightly curled fetal position. I was unable to lie still or warm up. I eventually went back to sleep and woke up at 5 am, this time with extreme nausea and threw up everything I had eaten the day before. This went on for a couple of minutes. I was still shivering constantly and sore and achy everywhere. Especially in my knees, shoulders, and lower back. At 6 am, I was still awake and while I still had chills, my face felt hot and I took my temperature twice. First getting 100.74 then 100.86. Slept deeply for the rest of the night. At noon on 3/27 I woke up with no nausea,  body aches but only in my joints but with general soreness everywhere (like after a good workout) and a temp still in the 100.7 degree range. I took 2 Tylenol tabs at 2pm. At 4pm, I only had slight body aches, a headache, and a slight brain fog left and my temp was at 98.7, so no more fever. No further problems showed  up and when I woke up at 9 am on 3/28, I felt absolutely fine other than soreness at the injection site and a little chest tightness which last for about 2 days, through 3/30.

Trouble sleeping the rest of the night with hot flashes. Migraine at about 7am, took migraine medicine, went away around 10am. Since then, major body aches and feeling out of it.

                                                Patient came in for Janssen COVID vaccine that was scheduled electronically online.  All appropriate prescreening was done and patient had no previous allergies or issues.  Patient was instructed to sit in one of the chairs designated for post vaccine observation for 15 minutes after her vaccine.  Within a minute or so  patient felt light headed and like she might pass out. She notified the technician who was right there and he notified me.  I assisted her to a sitting position on the floor from her chair and I was able to ease her back to a lying down position from there with her head on the floor and feet elevated above heart on a chair.  Patient was able to talk the whole time.  She told us at that point when she was younger she was scared of shots and had fainted when having them, but thought she was past that and did not mention it during screening. She said she was surprised to feel this way because she was so excited about getting her COVID vaccine.  She had not eaten much today (a small snack) and had rushed here for her appointment without getting food. I checked her blood pressure while she was lying down and it was 94/63 and pulse of 75.  She said she normally had lower end of normal blood pressure.   She was pale when I started checking her, but her color began to return to normal within minutes. After 5 minutes she felt well enough to sit up and we got her a granola bar and water.  She remained this way for 5 minutes and felt good, so we moved her to sitting in a chair and got her a pepperoni and cheese snack tray from the cafe.  She ate this and waited for 10minutes and felt good. We walked her to her car and she felt fine.  I called to verify she got home fine and she did.

I had severe chills and shakes, body aches, and a headache. It eventually turned into sweating. Around 8:30am, it&#39;s not as severe. I took tylenol around 8:30 am and do not feel like I have the chills anymore, just body aches and some fatigue.

                                                Sunday night, my heart started pounding really hard. I went to ER - Medical Center. They did an EKG and took my vitals. I had a fever (slight) and chills and was nauseous. Put  ONDANSETRON -4 mg. The nausea didn&#39;t go away and I couldn&#39;t eat or drink without vomiting until today. I couldn&#39;t eat or drink or was very tired and groggy and miserable. Today I  had another trip to the ER Medical, I got on an antibiotic and anti-nausea medication (GETHALEXIN - 500 mg for the GI) (METOCLOPRAMIGE HCL - 5 mg-  for nausea) from the hospital and I had a shot that went into my immune system. They also found a UTI today.

I started getting the sweats. After sitting for a few minutes, I tried to stand up and was very dizzy again. I immediately sat back down as I thought I was going to pass out. 30 minutes later, I had a nasty headache, the chills, pain in my knees and lower back, and neck pain. Also, I had pain at the site of the injection. I felt very nauseous. These symptoms persisted from hour 8 to 44 hours after receiving the shot.

I had a fever of 99.9 and had a headache across the front of the face and nauesa. All of this lasted together for about 6 to 7 hours. During this time I took Tyenol, used cold compress, wrapped up in blankets and sipped on water. After the chills and hot flashes subsided I continued to feel fatigue,and had  head and body aches for the next 18-24 hours. During this time I continued with Tyenol and fluids. In all it last about 36 hours before I felt like myself again.

Shortly felt a burning feeling in my chest and  collar bones, that spread to my head. My head started to burn, it felt like it was on fire, along with my neck and chest. I felt dizzy, like i was going to faint, the burning and dizziness lasted for about 5 minutes. Shortly after i felt like my throat closed up and I was having very labored breaths. The burning feeling in my body and dizziness came back, along with not feeling like i could breathe well. I went to an ER, they gave me an IV with Benadryl, and I started to feel well enough 2 hours later to go home.

Her color came back to her lips and her blood pressure improved. She was responding to questions appropriately. Pt was diaphoretic for approximately 10 minutes. Ice packs and water were provided. Pt was observed by the medical assistant for 30 minutes. Her HOB was elevated gradually until she was able to dangle her feet and sit on the side of the stretcher.  Pt stated that she was feeling better and was ready to go be with her roommate.    Vital signs were taken and BP 91/54, HR 70, O2 97%.  At 0952 HR was 62. 1005 BP 102/67, HR 57 O2 99%.

Patient had just received her one dose Janssen vaccine and was sitting in a chair approximately 3-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  She began to slump over in her chair and was unresponsive. Two RNs responded to assess the patient. Patients feet were elevated and ice packs applied to her neck and axillary areas. Patient was breathing and had a pulse. Patient responded to her name once and then passed out again. Patient was unable to respond after this.  Her eyes were open.  Patient was lifted into a wheelchair by three nurses and brought to a private area.  Patient was warm and sweat was running down her face.  Her sweater was removed and ice packs again were applied to her neck and axillary area.  Patient continued to have a pulse and was breathing.  EMS was called.  Patient slowly began to come around and could answer questions after about 5 minutes of being unresponsive. She was confused and had no memory of what had occurred. She reported feeling light headed and seeing spots in her vision.  She continued to feel light headed. EMS assessed patient.  Vitals were stable and blood sugar was WDL.  Patient reported feeling much better. She denied feeling light headed or dizzy any longer.  She was able to answer all questions asked.  Patient did not want to go to the hospital and refused transport to the hospital via ambulance. She was observed for an additional 20-30 minutes at which time her boss arrived to pick her up. She was educated on calling 911 if she began to feel light headed or dizzy again. Patient verbalized understanding. She was walked to the car by an RN.

Here it is 6 days later and I have developed a rash all over my body. On my back, my legs, my arms. It is very red and very itchy.

                                                Within seconds of receiving the vaccine I began to feel slightly dizzy. By the time I walked across the room to the observation table I was feeling lightheaded. They sat me down, gave me water and a cookie, but about 2min after the injection the dizziness was so intense that I began to black out. I was unconscious for about 1-2min, then came to but my vision was still unclear. I was taken via wheelchair to the paramedics on the opposite end of the gymnasium, and at this point I was heavily perspiring and very pale but still coherent. I felt my vision and dizziness significantly improve after being able to lay down. I was transported to the hospital for observation but had much improved by the time I arrived. An EKG, bloodwork, and cardiac tests were recommended to discern possible underlying heart related conditions, but I declined because I already had a PAT for thyroid surgery scheduled the next day that would be running those same tests. This reaction was likely due to not having eaten  for several hours prior to the vaccine. After about an hour I felt well enough to drive myself back home and dealt with mild aches and pains that evening, chills, and a low grade fever all of which resolved themselves by the next morning.

                                                I woke up noticing a slight headache, but I figured it was from poor sleep the night prior. I noticed after breakfast that I felt really cold and felt an internal shiver, especially in my chest. My fingers and toes were ice cold even with a sweater, blanket, and a warm tea. I noticed my skin starting to feel tender and I felt very fatigued. I wanted knew I needed to eat so that I could take ibuprofen, but I experienced a loss of appetite. I had a mild cough, but I felt too tired to even cough. I rocked in a chair in the sunlight outside for about 15 minutes and still felt cold. When I took my oral temperature after coming inside, I was reading 99.9. I took 400mg of Ibuprofen by 1130 and layed down to rest. Bundled in 3 layers, I felt the shivering couldn&#39;t stop. My headache got worse and my skin was tender to the touch. I was able to sleep for approximately 3 hours and I woke up drenched in sweat. I took my oral temperature again and was at 101.1. I drank some more water and tried to sleep some more. When I woke up around 4:30 pm, I felt a lot better. My temperature went down to 97.8 and I had a boost in energy and appetite. I no longer had a headache and I had only mild muscle aches. By the next morning, I felt completely normal again.

She began to feel faint and an employee of our facility caught her as she experienced a near syncopal episode. She was promptly placed in Trendelenburg position and vitals obtained. BP was 90/58 with mild tachycardia to max of 130-140 bpm. Patient was given supportive treatment and monitored. BP improved to 110/70 after 5 minutes and 120/72 after 15 minutes. Patient continued to feel very dizzy and weak, however, and became tachycardic and diaphoretic each time she attempted to move to a seated position. After 1 hour of monitoring and vitals showing continued tachycardia, decision was made to transport the patient to ER for further testing. Patient expressed agreement and understanding of plan to transport to ER via ambulance.

Every-time I stand up it jumps to 116. My resting heart rate was 113 for 8hours straight Monday night. So the j&amp;j website lists that as an allergic reaction. The urgent care basically said wait it out and be careful cuz if I move like too fast I could pass out again cuz of the blood pressure

Acetaminophen was taken after first symptoms appeared and approximately every 6-8 hours until symptoms passed.  Arm soreness lasted several days after vaccination.  On 03/20/2021: felt 2 large swollen (probably) lymph nodes above collarbone on left side. Lymph nodes are visibly raised under the skin. The one closer to the left arm is larger than the one next to it which is closer to the neck. They are barely sore, if at all. Lymph nodes are still swollen at the time of this writing.

                                                The injection itself was quite painful (and I&#39;ve had many vaccine shots in my life). Felt completely fine until around 4pm when I felt a dull headache. Around 5pm, my head was throbbing so much that I couldn&#39;t leave my bed. Around 6pm, I felt muscle pains starting around my neck, slowly moving to my shoulders, chest, and upper back. Without taking any medication, I slept and woke up around 8pm. I was sweating, felt so cold but hot at the same time. The muscle pains were intense, and my head hurt so much that I took a single capsule of 200mg Advil. The pain became more manageable around 30 minutes later. Was still sweating, and muscle aches continued. I slept again at around 2am (May 26, 2021) and woke up at 10am. Head was no longer hurting, but muscle aches were still lingering. Currently, 1:04pm on March 26, 2021, I feel weak and tired with muscles pains around my upper body, but overall feeling much better than yesterday.

                                                I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine at 8:30AM on Friday, March 26. The only symptoms I experienced until that evening were mild soreness at the injection site, mild stiffness/soreness in my left arm and my neck, and mild body aches. At 6:00PM that day, I was driving and experienced sudden-onset nausea and dizziness. I experienced tunnel vision and my vision began to black out. I was able to pull off the road and began retching and dry heaving. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my lips and then in my right hand, each of which lasted for about a minute. The nausea lasted for 5-10 minutes, after which it dissipated and I started experiencing chills. After returning home, around 9:30PM I experienced a severe headache and a return of sudden-onset nausea. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my right hand again, which disappeared after about 5 minutes. I retched and dry heaved again, and I took two Advil. The nausea passed and I was able to go back to sleep. The next morning, the nausea had completely disappeared,  and the only lingering symptoms were a mild headache and mild stiffness/body aches.

The entire night was spent tossing and turning, drenched in sweat while simultaneously feeling like I was on fire. On top of this I had a massive headache. Today is the day after and my fever has gone down throughout the day, but it is pretty bad. I still have a headache and also vomited a few times today. I have been taking acetaminophen and took some pepto bismol. I was able to start eating later in the day.

                                                After vaccination the patient looked to be doing well, good color in the face and communicating freely. After providing the same immunization to her spouse she lost color in her face, began sweating, and became faint. She did not lose consciousness but was drowsy, diaphoretic, pale and stated she lost hearing for a couple minutes. I kept her awake and asked her questions to assess for alertness. She was aware of date, location, name, year. She was not improving after 5 minutes so paramedics were called to evaluate her. She was cared for by the paramedic team and recovered after 40 minutes. She was diagnosed with vasovagal syncope due to the vaccine. She refused transport to the ER and left of her own accord.

When I attempted to take a shower, I fainted for a few seconds and it was a struggle to move. Only felt comfortable when I was laying down. My muscles all felt painful and sore, had a painful headache, felt very disoriented and woozy. It was a struggle to walk or move, and couldn&#39;t talk loud or for a long time at once. Had to go home from work and spent the rest of the day sleeping. Around 4pm, 24 hours after the injection, my muscles felt less sore and was feeling better. The next morning, I was back to being completely normal.

Around 8hrs after injection, I grew ill with a fever, severe muscle and joint aches, nausea, and the headache worsened into neck pain. I have had a bit of anxiety and all around emotional swings. I felt foggy and &#34;off&#34; at this time, like my head isn&#39;t clear. There has also been constant aching at the site of injection in my left arm.
