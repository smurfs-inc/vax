                                                The patient received Janssen COVID vaccine on 3/6 to RIGHT deltoid. She has a past medical history significant for LEFT sided breast cancer, treated with lumpectomy and radiation ~5 yrs prior. Remains on Letrozole. 1 day post-vaccine, she developed fevers (tmax 104), chills, malaise. 2 days post-vaccine, the fevers, chills, malaise dissipated but she developed a &#34;rash&#34; to her LEFT breast (same site as prior malignancy). This rash became a widespread erythematous area encompassing her entire breast. Axilla excluded.  No palpable lymphadenopathy. She reports area to be tender and itching. Rash is blanchable. It is somewhat response to OTC antihistamines (Claritin/Benadryl) and OTC hydrocortisone. She has no respiratory distress, lingering fever, or other allergic reactions. She was given a prescription topical steroid (triamcinolone) and will follow up with her in a few days, if she remains stable. If not back to baseline within the week, will obtain breast MRI for further evaluation.

                                                I noticed a rash on my right upper arm.  At first it was small bumps (no color) &amp; didn&#39;t itch.  After a few days the bumps got larger &amp; started to itch.  They also appear to be turning red in color &amp; possibly spreading.  I have been putting anti-itch cream (Benadryl) on them twice a day.  I didn&#39;t think much of it @ first since I got the vaccine in my left arm.  With the weather being cold, I have only been wearing long sleeve shirts.  I have not changed my laundry or shower soap either.

Initially stated she could breathe/swallow just fine but very quickly stated the swallowing was getting more difficult. 911 was called  followed by 0.3 mg EpiPen in her right outer thigh and 50mg of oral Benadryl. Her BP was then taken around 4:45 and it was 162/93 at which point EMT arrived and took over.

                                                Approximately, 11 hours after the shot Severe cold chills, so severe my teeth would not stop chattering. I was shaking so hard my body ached from shaking. Goosebumps, a crazy headache.  I thought i was having an anurysm.  Not a normal headache.  Cold sweats so bad you could just about wring out my sheets and clothes. Nausea, some vomiting.  On a scale of 1-10 of these symptoms is was an 11-12.  These symptoms changed as the days went on.  In the moring of the first night.  I was ok.  Woke up with a bad headache, still nauseas and still cold but not like at night tollerable.  About 5PM day 2 it started all over again, just as severe.  Next moring ok.  This pattern kept reapeating for 4 days.  Food now getting repulsive.  No way I  could eat anything.  On day 5 the symptoms continue now throug the day, however the teeth chattering not happeing and the cold chills a bit less severe.  I would say by day 5 on the scale of 1-10 i am now about a 9. This was so horrible for so long.  Every single night i would wake up soaked in my own sweat.  This is still happening 11 days later.  I am still experiencing headaches.  I never have headaches.  I did not go to a Doctor because i figured what are they going to do, i have to ride this out.  Also a strange thing is took my temparture daily and seveal times.  Zero temprature. by day 5 I could not get out of bed for 3 days.  Day 8 things getting better, still cold chills and headaches but not as bad.  Day 9 way better, now getting hungry. Daytime cold chills now gone mostly less headaches.  Oddly headaches and cold chills start about 4-5pm and continue through the night.  In the morning i wake up with a headache still today.

                                                Sensitivity started within four hours of dose. Autistic sensitivities to maximum. Scrambling of all senses including proprioception to the point of not being able to move from standing  or sitting. By hour seven, all sensory inputs were too overwhelming to do anything but shut down and sleep. 911 was not an option because they don&#39;t let you sleep, and ERs are overwhelming already, before maximizing all inputs. 7.5 mg hydrocodone for overwhelming pain and sensitivity, allowed sleep. On waking, sensitivity was lessened, but the pain started, 18 hours after the vaccination. Emotional lability for three days. Average aching of arm and injection site were not above expected levels. &#34;Brain fog&#34; and lack of ability to articulate (another autism symptom) started within that first seven hours, and diminished over next ten days. Not yet gone as of today  Dry mouth; overproduction of thick &#39;chunky&#39; mucus that wouldn&#39;t cough out, treated with guaifenesin, lasted three days. Shortness of breath and cough associated with that mucus also diminished after three days. Not completely gone ten days later.   Excessive thirst, onset two hours after vaccine, lasted two days.   Hyperalert (can&#39;t sleep without drugs), hyperactive despite weakness, and hypervigilant (extreme startle reflexes) lasted three days as well. Sleep was achieved with hydrocodone and THC.  All over body pain, feelings of immune mobilization (coming down with) for two days were not above expected levels.   No fainting or other collapse at time of injection, or later.  Knowing that severe over-stimulation is exacerbated in a medical setting, it was decided not to seek medical support for three days of systemic symptoms that would have easily merited hospitalization.

                                                Shot immediately started stinging.  My upper arm swelled with a hard ridge about 3 inches long and 1 inch wide.  Extremely painful.  Could barely raise my arm and could not sleep on that side or tolerate even soft touch of my entire upper arm.  No other reaction that seemed like an allergic response.  I did get very sick for 2 days with severe flu symptoms and strange shooting pains in random parts of my body.  Enough pain to wake me from a sound sleep.  Bad chills, but no fever. I did. I give my legs seemed swollen for about 3 days.   I got the J&amp;J vaccine on 3-6-21 and my arm is still swollen with a slightly smaller hard and painful ridge at the injection site and it sometimes throbs and itches severely.  Today is 4-2-21.  Starting to wonder if it will ever go away.  I still cannot sleep on that side.  The pain overall is less, but it still throbs and itches periodically throughout the day.

                                                Chills and low grade fever, then within another hour felt light-headed and my body hurt all over - skin was sensitive to even my clothes.  Headache started in the front of my forehead by late evening, and I literally couldn&#39;t even walk up to my bed.  Restless sleeping with all the sweating and chills.  Woke up with headache remaining and feeling very &#34;wiped out&#34; and still light-headed.  No more chills or sweats the next day, but I was weak for about 48 hours.  Honestly - I&#39;m very healthy and getting Covid directly from another person couldn&#39;t have been worse than getting  the vaccine.  :(   And I am even saying that as a 35 year professional Research Scientist.

Twenty minutes after shot, felt skin flush pass over me and was directed to private area where paramedic took blood pressure and checked for hives. No hives but bumpy skin. Blood pressure spiked to 186/75. No history of such high blood pressure. Waited a while and blood pressure went down, flush and skin bumps subsided, and I went home. Blood pressure erratic in evening but never as high. Next day pulse higher than normal. Took homeopathic remedy. Pulse slowed down a bit. Better by next day.

My life partner started calling my name and check my pulse (which he said was strong) ; then I came to but was really dizzy; I was nauseous and vomited for a few minutes; extremely hot/sweating; and after I stopped vomiting, then had a bowel movement (He had to aid me in getting to the bathroom).   About 20 - 25 minutes later I felt much better; everything calmed down.  I was ultimately able to fall back to sleep.

I have pollen allergies to trees and due to staying indoors and wearing a mask I was having no bad allergy symptoms and never had tinnitus on my worse pollen day.   The tinnitus symptom was loud enough to notice over all other noise and very irritating in a quiet room.    The high pitch sound was non stop and constant.  I went to sleep that night and woke up Saturday morning still hearing it.  I felt that morning like I was having a very mild cold with very mild congestion.  I felt likeI had swelling under my ears    I was not tired but I did feel like staying in bed and sleeping  as if my body was mildly requesting it.  I slept most of the day.  Woke up with the high pitch sound but it seemed a little bit lower in volume.  Around 8 pm the sound left as quickly as it came

Woke on Friday  3/19/21 with fatigue and diarrhea with body aches.  Woke Saturday 3/20/21 with fever 101.7. (During this duration to include today I have  taken Tylenol rotating with Motrin every 2 hours, this never broke my fevers). Fever continues on and off with body aches, nausea, the worst headache I have ever experienced and pain in the base back of my neck L side.  These symptoms have continued since Saturday.  It is now Friday, 3/26/21.  I will say that during waking hours 8am - 10pm on Wednesday 3/24/21 and Thursday 3/25/21 I had no symptoms except absolute fatigue.  The fever returned on those two nights at around midnight with it breaking about 4 am, waking up in a pile of sweat.

More patches developed over March 27, 28, and 29th.I self treated using Benadryl, Pepcid, cortisone cream and memetasone furoate cream.

At the appointment I was given the regiment of one Claritin tablet in am, one 20 mg Pepcid in pm,  Hydroxyzine  25mg at bedtime and to continue use of memetasone cream as needed.  Rash has resolved. Still using meds as I felt itchy yesterday

I continued to have a low grade fever for much of the next day and generally felt bad with headache and malaise.  On the second day after my vaccination, 3/28/2021, I felt fine.

                                                The next morning, 09:00 am, I had mild flu symptoms which was full body aches and feeling feverish and unwell. I didn&#39;t register a fever on the thermometer. I was very tired; no appetite. I stayed resting all day. Slept a lot. It was easy for me to sleep - very unusual. By 9:00 pm that all lifted and I was feeling back to normal. The morning of March 28, I woke up with a very sore throat. And on 3/29, I had really continued sore throat on and off and Tuesday it got much worse. There was a really strange sensation of being extremely thirsty - I had never had experienced that before. Swollen gland on the right side of my throat - between the jaw and ear area. I had a little bit of an earache on the right side. I drove by the drive-in testing area. I am working in person each day so I get the drive by testing - I think Tuesday, the 30th. Called the dr and did the Telehealth visit - Wednesday - the 31st. I had in and out of laryngitis - raspy voice and headache. I looked in my throat with flashlight and could see a definitive red spot in back of throat and some white spots.  They said it could be a blocked salivary gland and told me to eat something very sour to activate it. Over 6 to 8 hours it did clear the issue somewhat - thirst went away. I still had a sore throat. They told me that by the weekend, I could maybe start antibiotic. Saturday night I took first dose of Zpack - two tablets at first dose and then one tablet a day after that. By late evening Sunday (Easter) I felt some relief of symptoms. This week I still have a little bit of raspy voice and post nasal drip and clearing my throat at this point. I am recovering but not fully recovered.

It hurts so badly while the needle was in my arm and when she took it out it was worse. I was in such pain that I began to sweat profusely and apparently I turned white and began dry heaving. This was all within a minute or so.  I really thought I was going to pass out. A woman with a tag that said pharmacist came rushing over. She got a reclining chair with wheels, they help me into it and then took me to a recovery room. After a few more minutes of sweating and dry heaving I began feeling better.  The pharmacist got me some paper towels so I could dry myself off as I was drenched in sweat. I asked her for a bottle of water. I waited the 15 minutes and came home.  They never checked my vital signs. Once I got home, I laid down and slept for 15 hours. I was fine the next day and my arm was never sore.  Could  the shot have hit a nerve? I?ve never felt such acute pain.

On 7th day, hives with raised red bumps and welts and intense burning itch appeared on lower legs. These gradually spread to upper legs and abdomen over several hours. After taking OTC antihistamine, itching subsided. Rash was gone the following day.

                                                A few minutes after the vaccine my heart began palpatating and I began sweating profusely.  My vitals were checked, I was given water and moved to a cooler area of the facility.  HR was still elevated but I wasnt feeling as flushed.  By 4pm that evening I began having having chills and a fever of 100-100.4 which lasted about 4hrs.  Later that evening my HR elevated to 125 with the feeling of feeling I was having a heart attack.  By that Wed. my HR was still at 125 in motion and about 75 still so I went to visit my PCP on Thurs and when I arrived the HR was 77 but during the visit it elevated to 125 and blood work was done resulting in my tyroid level elevated and since getting the vaccine my HR had been up and down.  When in motion its elevated and when sitting its around 75.

I thought it was my N95 mask so decided to head to the car after my 15 minute wait period was completed.  After sitting down in the car I started the following symptoms:  shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, swelling of face, dizziness, weakness.  I sit in the car for approximately 15 minutes then headed home.  I had a driver (thank goodness).  I continued to have symptoms and what felt like elevated blood pressure (I did not have access to a pressure cuff).  After resting at my driver&#39;s house for about 5 hours I felt better and headed home.  The next morning the symptoms were less but still present.  In addition I had a slight rash on my stomach that wrapped around my back.  After approximately 48 hours all of the symptoms subsided.  My blood pressure had returned to normal also.  All swelling went down.

                                                One week after my vaccination, I had what I thought was an asthma attack. I used my inhaler and it eased the symptoms for a short while, but I had to use it again a short time later as my breathing was a bit labored. My chest tightened up and it was hard to take deep breaths. From that date on, I have had tightness in the lungs and it hurts to breath deeply. It is getting so I am tired now after having this issue for the past 10 days or more. It seems to come and go and is not constant, but it does happen every day since March 10, 2021.

                                                The Pt presents with swelling of her lips 20 minutes following injection of 1 dose Janssen vaccine to the left deltoid. The Pt states that she has had anaphylaxis in the past to Macrobid, Sulfa, Amoxicillin. She has an Epipen at home but states that she has never had to use it because her symptoms develop slowly. In the past she has driven herself to the ER where she has received breathing treatments and observation. Pt denies swelling of the eyes, tongue, throat tightness, difficulty swallowing, itching of the skin, SOB, CP, nausea or vomiting. She also denies dizziness, lightheadedness, or vision changes. The Pt also has a Hx of meningioma and SVT s/p ablation.   Suspicion for anaphylaxis high due to lip swelling, wheezing, and previous episodes of delayed onset anaphylaxis. Pt drove herself today so IM injection of diphenhydramine was delayed. Upon recheck Pt?s wheezing was unchanged and lip swelling had not progressed further. Due to past episodes of SVT and no progression of current symptoms, epinephrine was on stand by but not administered. Care was transferred to EMS.  Care was transferred to EMS and Pt was transported to the hospital.

Today is Monday and I still have diarrhea.

                                                March 13, 2021-1:30pm-Shot administered to right arm-it bled and the nurse had to apply pressure with an alcohol swab. It stopped immediately. 1:40-started feeling a tightness in the muscle in my neck under my right ear Stayed a few minutes longer than the required 15 to see if anything else presented. Mentioned it to the nurse and rep. The rep asked if I was nervous about getting the shot. When I said yes, he said it may just be that. Told me to contact my doctor with additional issues.  1:55-When leaving the parking lot, I felt my lips and nostril on the right side go numb-it felt like when Novocain is wearing off after a dentist visit. As the day progressed, the area under my ear and down my neck got more and more sensitive. My lips continued to feel numb. My injection site was tender and black and blue. When I went to bed at 9pm, I began experiencing lots of pain in my right lower jaw. I took a Tylenol but it didn&#39;t alleviate the pain. I called on-call doctor. Since I already had taken a Tylenol, he suggested an anti-inflammatory and warm moist compresses and to contact him again if things worsened. 3/14/21-7:00am-Upon awaking, my jaw pain was virtually gone but the whole area I had had the issue with was very tender to the touch. My lip still felt a bit numb.  3:25pm- It is now 26 hours since my vaccination. I still feel like I had trauma to the right side of my face and neck because it is sensitive to the touch. I also have a continued slight sensitivity of my lips on the right side. My glands on both sides of my neck now seem tender, as well. 3/15/21-3/17/21-I continue to have random pain/tenderness in the aforementioned areas. I also have an aura of tingling in my brain from time to time.

Took Tylenol and it helped for about 3 hours.    03/15/2021 Woke up with symptoms again around 2:30 am and took Tylenol.  Woke up around 8 am with slight headache and VERY tired.  Kept a nagging headache and &#34;brain fog&#34; all of the day  and tired.  Took Tylenol and it helped some.  I felt a bit foggy all day even with Tylenol.  3/16/2021 Still felt tired with a bit of a headache on and off. Took Tylenol and it helped.    I don&#39;t take meds often so I just took 500 mg Tylenol, 1 tablet. I am healthy with no underlying conditions and do not have reactions to the flu shot.  I expected the same  with this shot.

                                                During a conversation, I was told I began smacking my lips then proceeded to completely ?zoneout? for  5-7 minutes. My arm was touched and I was asked a couple of questions to which I did not respond. After a few minutes, I became alert and continued conversation where I left off. I was unaware any of this was happening. I was pretty much wiped out for about 5 days. I have never had a seizure before.

I felt a burning all over my body (especially my back), and body aches, and began a fever which grew from 97.3 (my normal) to a high of 100.1  (&#43;2.8 degrees) within 2.5 more hours (by 9:30pm).   Very bad chills and fever.  By 9:30 took 1 500mg Tylenol.   Little sleep that night.  Felt very unwell next day (3/9) including headache.  At noon I could get up and get some food.  By 1pm fever subsided completely, but temporarily.  Fever came back by 4pm, but only to 98.6 (&#43;1.3 above normal).  Took another 500mg Tylenol.  Night 2 slept well. Woke up 3/10 no fever, headache gone, but balance still peculiar.  I noticed the first night that my sense of balance was off.

The muscle is still affected and strained after 6 days. I waited a half hour at the site and got into my car at 3:45. On the drive home within 30 minutes my face started to itch and turn red, then my mouth inside started to itch, then my eyes started to itch. After that my throat started to feel gravely, so I took 75 mgs of gel cap benedryl. This is what I feel and take upon getting stung by a bee. I also took my albuterol inhaller two puffs which I also always have on me because of my asthma. I was sleepy but had dinner and went to be. I did not feel that I had to take more benedryl during the night.

It then began breaking out on my face and legs.  I took 25 mg of benadryl.  The rash continued to spread so  I went to the ER. They administered prednisone, pepcid, and benadryl.  After about 1 hour the itching was better and the rash began to fade but it didn&#39;t go away.  The ER sent my home with a predisone dose pack for 6 days and to take 50 mg  benadryl every 6 hours.  When i awakened this morning I had the rash on other sites on my arms, legs and stomach and in my right eye, it was red and a little swollen.  I took the first day&#39;s dose of prednisone and 50 mg benadryl and 20 mg of famotidine. After about 30 mins to 1 hour the itching and redness improved but has not completely gone.

Hives in the crook of my right arm. Burning, itchy little red bumps. I couldn&#39;t swallow but I think that was from the high blood sugar as my mouth was very dry.

                                                Immediately after the shot, I felt dizzy and started to sweat throughout my body including my hands.  I waited more than 40 minutes to see if improved but it was exactly the same. Didn&#39;t get better or worse. I did not report it immediately because it was not alarming and I did not feel bad. It was just my head that was spinning a little bit and sweating. After waiting more than 45 minutes I decided to drive home because the dizziness was not that strong. I would say it was like a 45% dizzyness if I have to calculate how I felt. The sweating passed after 4 hours and at soon as I arrived home I went to bed and relax. It is now 6:08 pm and the dizziness has improved considerably. I would calculate now about 10% of that vertigo feeling. It is getting better and better. I just wanted to point out that in no time I was feeling bad. Everything was just in my hearing labyrinth internal with balance. I also felt 20 minutes of echoing in my ears about 2 hours ago.

                                                On the morning of March 15, I developed  a red rash on throat, lower facial cheeks, and chin.  Lips tingled a little bit.  Rash did not itch.   Took 2 Benadryl three times that day, contacted doctor via email.   The rash was better the next day (March 16) but took 2 Benadryl again three times that day.   Sent photo to doctor who had an allergist in the clinic look.  He said it was a reaction to the vaccine.    March 17 rash was completely gone and have had no other reactions since.

My physician was notified.  I have taken another Benedryl tablet to help with the rash.

The next day- Sunday, along with Monday &amp; Tues. was horrid. I am covered from my scalp to the tops of my feet, my crotch hurts, as do my breasts. Used Benadryl cream, aloe vera to no avail.

                                                I noticed a red rash on my legs, arms, and torso at about 8 pm yesterday, March 12; it is red blotches (no hives) and feels more like a sunburn .  There is a burning sensation with mild itching and red blotches/spots.  I contacted my physician who recommended OTC treatment at home and advised me to report it to VAERS.  It is mild in terms of impact but not expected four days after the vaccination date.

                                                Patient had normal side effects of low grade fever, chills, headache, but then developed a swollen lymph node under her right arm. (Right Axillary Node) Patient is retired healthcare worker. She said upon palpitation the node feels &#34;golf-ball&#34; sized. She stated it does seem to be shrinking in size by this morning. We felt it may be an important symptom to document due to her Lupus diagnosis and lack of studies in patients with this disease.

                                                Slight chill started about 7:15 p.m. and within minutes my entire body was shaking uncontrollably.  After about 1 and 1/2 hours extreme shaking stopped.  Felt very wiped out the following day with slight headache and legs hurting.

                                                15-20 minutes after the injection, I started feeling a tightness in back of my throat; I broke out in cold sweat. I started getting dizzy and very whoozy. I felt my vision starting to close in. I thought I was going to pass out. I got the attention of the person across me to get an attendant and they brought me a chair with wheels. Two people got me up (and I&#39;m not a big person) - they were worried I was going down and I was taken to exam room. They said I was white as a sheet. She checked my eyes and throat a few times and checked my blood pressure. It was lower than normal but she didn&#39;t seem really concerned about it - 104 over 60 something which is low for me. She gave me water to sip. She gave me very cold compresses to put on my forehead. They watched me pretty good. She had the epi-pen ready. She watched me and I sat in there and nurse came in a quite a few times to check me for about an hour. About an hour later the tightness went away and I started feeling myself again. We went home. I went to sleep. I woke up at night to go to bathroom and I was still a little woozy but I didn&#39;t fall. Next day, I just didn&#39;t feel well. My left arm was starting to hurt - was no swelling; it was a little red at injection site. It hurt just a little. I was woozy. My eyes couldn&#39;t focus as well. I felt out of it. I drank a lot of water and took a nap.  Yesterday, I felt pretty decent but still woozy somewhat. I tried to run errands with my husband  - just wasn&#39;t quite right. Today, much better but I&#39;m not quite myself yet. Just a little wooziness - weird feeling. Yesterday, I did feel a soreness in the back of my right calf muscle. It wasn&#39;t warm to the touch or swollen. I don&#39;t have it anymore, it went away.  It could have been a muscle thing from the first day of the vaccine when I got home and I got up and almost fell down. I do still have some achiness in joints. Especially in my knees - which isn&#39;t normal because they are replaced.

The next day, bigger lump, swollen, all just below injection and red, moderate chills, a bit itchy, nausea., and painful. Same on 3rd day but much bigger redness spreading down arm, 2 1/2 by 2 1/2&#39; hard mass and red, itchy, painful, chills and nausea. Next morning called Dr. I am taking amoxicillin-clav 875-125ng tab.  Three days later mass is turning from red to pink and retreating. Still hurts  and now bruses show around the injection site, which I thought was strange. The vaccine actually hurt when given (I get injections every three months, so I know what they will feel like, but this hurt and went very deeply and then burned). I felt warm afterwards for about 10 minutes.

My BP stayed high and I felt not good, I had pressure in my chest and some pressure on the left and right side of my breast,  BP was 177 at 4pm. I went home to bed I woke up with pressure again in my chest. I went to the Dr and he said come back in two weeks and see how you are, I went in this last monday and he put me on medication for high blood pressure

The next morning I woke up, I felt like I got hit by a truck, I felt so bad, no chest and body hurt. I got up and did a breathing treatment. I went to the Dr. because it sacred me, she gave me antibiotics , cough medicine with codeine- I couldn&#39;t stop coughing.  I asked her to change my nebulizer treatment because it wasn&#39;t working.  The Dr. suspected that this would happen.

                                                On day 11 post shot I started to feel mildly nauseated. Next day nausea increased, as did muscle aches and pain - by early evening I had repeated bouts of uncontrollable vomiting and uncontrollable diarrhea [no cramps, no warning] that lasted most of the night.  I did have a fever briefly - got all red and felt like I was on fire - but that passed pretty quickly while the rest continued.   I had to stay up all night, any attempt to lie down triggered more vomiting.  By 3 in the morning I was ?on empty? and by 6 am could lie down.  Nausea took three more days to leave completely.  Muscle pain is resolving, almost gone.  I am resuming my meds [everything that went down before came right back up].  The only tummy pain was after hours of vomiting [muscle strain].   Today is the 25th and I?m still tired and a bit foggy but otherwise feel better.  I had a call with my doctor about this and she said I should report it so that?s what I?m doing.

                                                Prior to vaccination, the patient stated that she was nervous, but seemed relieved and okay directly following the vaccination.  Following vaccination, patient became restless during the 15 minute post-vaccination window about 2-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  She initially presented with uncontrollable shaking/bouncing legs, palpitation, sweating, and shortness of breath (though this was very brief.   Patient remained coherent and oriented to time/person/place.   The shaking and palpitations subsided after a couple minutes and resumed towards the end of the 15 minute waiting period, accompanied by nausea.  25 minutes post-vaccination she appeared to have stabilized, and we assisted the patient to her room nearby at her request to allow her to lie down while being monitored.  After returning to her room, she very quickly ran to her sink due to her nausea, then after a minute of attempting to vomit, she collapsed and appeared to have briefly lost consciousness.  EMS was called and the patient was rolled onto her side to prevent choking in the event of emesis.  Patient remained responsive, but was weak and clammy with a weak pulse and breathing.  After the firefighters came, a search of the apartment found the previously listed medications.  Additionally, the patient experienced a seizure-like episode lasting 15 seconds in duration.  Once the EMT came, they assessed her and monitored her in the ambulance; they reported that her condition appeared stable, her vitals were strong, and transported her to Hospital for observation/testing.

When I woke up the next morning about 7:30 a.m., my body felt fine, but my brain was a bit foggy.  This continued until about 12:00 p.m.  After that, I was fine.

All other sensations normal-no nausea, no headache, etc.  Small finger, finger next to it,-and their part of the hand to the wrist -were first numb, with occasional tingles, now still numb.[7:30 pm.]  Slight cramp from top of arm to neck, is off -and- on from injection wait-time til now.

She felt well enough to leave the pharmacy on her own after 25-30 minutes.  The  patient had a prior history of anxiety prior to receiving vaccinations and was very nervous about getting the vaccination prior to administration.  The patients daughter was with her and felt that her symptoms were due to anxiety about  getting vaccinated, but later called the pharmacy asking to report the adverse events as being related to receiving the vaccine.  It is not known weather or not the symptoms are directly related to the vaccine.

                                                Jansen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the vaccination on 3/12/2021, about 8:30AM, at Fairgrounds. I needed the J&amp;J vaccine, one Moderna or Pfizer as I have a history of anaphylaxis. County Public Health received about 200 does of the J&amp;J and 800 of Moderna and Pfizer.   I waited at the vaccine site about 40 minutes after the vaccine. I went home, ate, read, and became unusually sleepy so took a nap. I woke up about 2:00PM and noticed my lips and tongue were swollen, and sore. I took 2 Benadryl. The Benadryl seems to have worked as expected. I will take 2 more when I go to bed, about 11:00.  I&#39;m unusually sleepy, and my joints ache. Overall, however, I think I am experiencing a very mild reaction and I&#39;m thankful for the vaccine. I sent my doctor a message through the patient portal, telling him of the reaction. His office is closed so he will get the message on Monday.

                                                On MON evening after the shot, at 11:00pm I experience severe chills that lasted for hours. Tuesday morning I awoke with a bad headache and had body aches all day as well as tendonitis- like pain in both lower arms. I felt somewhat better on WED but I did notice that my compression sleeve on my right arm (lymphedema arm) felt more snug than usual. That night I had severe chills and fever of 101. I slept until 11:45am on THU and felt aches all over. Very fatigued. Went back to sleep from 2:00pm until 6:00pm. Temp was down to 99.8.  When I woke and removed my compression garment, my arm was red and swollen, also rash-like bumps, and was very warm to the touch. FRI morning it looked worse, so I contacted my lymphedema specialist and then my PCP. This is NOT a good situation for anyone who has lymphedema and will necessitate months of treatment.

                                                Within 5 minutes of the shot, my skin began to itch all over (legs stomach, arms, neck) and my tongue went numb.  I have had this reaction before with exposure to wet polyurethane.  The doctor looked at my leg to see if if there was a rash (there was not) and she gave me a bendryl.  The symptoms subsided.  I stayed at the clinic for a total of 2 hours.  Later that evening, the itching came back so I gave myself one benedryl and the itching subsided.  The following morning the itching was gone and my tongue felt better.

                                                Johnson and Johnson Janssen COVID-19 EUA vaccine  At the time of the injection, the vaccine burned as it entered my arm. (I have never felt that burning sensation with any other vaccination that I have had in the past. Twenty minutes after the vaccination, I became lightheaded and dizzy.  I could walk but I was wobbly. At one hour after the vaccination, I felt a sharp stabbing pain in the left side of my tongue and then the left side and only the left side of my tongue began to go numb. Within a couple of minutes, I realized that my left jaw was going numb, too.  The numbness slowly but surely began to move up the left side of my face all the way to the top of my head.  I had a sharp but brief headache on the left side of my head  that subsided quickly but the numbness remained.  I went home and talked to two people on the phone for several hours because they wanted to be sure that I was OK. At two hours after the vaccination, my face was still numb but I could think and talk clearly, but I was clearing my throat and coughing a lot.  At that point, I also realized that my whole left arm was a little numb and my fingers on my left hand were tingling.  That numbness lasted about 20 minutes and then subsided. The facial numbness lasted for hours.  I wasn&#39;t scared and I wasn&#39;t in pain but it was very strange.  It felt a little bit like the after affects of dental anesthesia but it wasn&#39;t just in my mouth it was the whole left side of my face.   I believe that this must have been an allergic reaction to one of the chemicals in the vaccine but I don&#39;t know which one.  If you can tell me which chemical it might have been, I will avoid it in the future.

                                                Patient is a 69-year-old female who reports a history of hayfever who is coming in today after recent Covid vaccination with concerns of facial swelling also complaining of the rash and itching to her chest.  On exam the patient has obvious facial swelling.  She has what appears to be an urticarial rash on her chest.  While she does have swelling around her lips and face otherwise she does not appear to have any obvious signs of airway involvement with no swelling of her tongue or uvula, she has good phonation with normal respirations without difficulty.  Does not appear to be having reactive airway disease exacerbation at this time.  Does not appear to have impending respiratory distress.  She otherwise does have some skin changes in her bilateral lower extremities that she reports is baseline with her history of eczema.  Primary concern at this time is for possible allergic reaction.  Patient appears to have angioedema.  Does not appear to have anaphylaxis.  Other abnormalities are considered.  Patient will be connected to cardiac and respiratory monitors.  IV access will be obtained.  The patient will be given a 1 L IV fluid bolus.  She will be given Benadryl, Solu-Medrol, and famotidine.  Patient be monitored for response.  Labs have been ordered to evaluate.  EKG as well as chest x-ray will be obtained.  We will file VARES report.   Chest x-ray obtained.  There is no acute cardiac no acute pulmonary pathology on my interpretation.  Laboratory evaluation has returned.  The patient&#39;s CBC is reassuring.  CMP shows a glucose of 78, otherwise reassuring without significant abnormality.  Troponin within normal limits.  Covid, influenza, RSV testing is negative.  On repeat evaluation the patient is resting comfortably.  She reports that the itching has resolved.  Her face feels less uncomfortable.  She has had no progression of the swelling.  On repeat examination she continues to have facial swelling as well as swelling around her lips however she has no tongue swelling, no swelling within her posterior oropharynx, and her phonation continues to be normal.  She and her friend were informed of the initial findings.  Plan at this time is to admit for further evaluation and treatment.

                                                couple of hours after receiving the injection, I had a large hive on my mid chest area. Later I had one on my hip. I was not concerned as I have them on occasion. I felt fine. Went to bed that evening and woke up with extreme burning and itching in my index finger and thumb of my right hand. Also a very large hive on the inside of my arm about 2 1/2 inches from my wrist bend. Intense itching.  I took a Benadryl tablet and felt better almost immediately. Later in the day about 6 1/2 hours later, I had more itching on my hip where the high was located. I took another Benadryl. I am fine. I also call my doctor and reported it.

                                                I received the vaccine at a Department of Health vaccine clinic at the Hospital. About 25 minutes after receiving the Janssen vaccine, my face became flushed (red) and I felt weak. We were in the hospital parking lot and drove to that hospital&#39;s emergency room, where I was evaluated. After several tests (item 18) I was declared okay and left after 3 hours with no further intervention. I probably should have taken a Benadryl (diphenhydramine) after the shot to prevent such a reaction.

I woke my husband and asked him to take my temperature - I had no fever.  I then asked him to call 911 to ask if my symptom was typical of the vaccine.  They sent paramedics to my house and before they arrived I started feeling better so there was no treatment performed.  The whole bad episode lasted 10-15 minutes and I felt like I was going to die.  It was not repeated.

                                                Woke up at 4AM on  03/05/2021 with shaking chills, feeling very cold, couldn&#39;t get warm.  Shaking so bad I couldn&#39;t get whole sentences out.  Body aches and stiffness, affected my walking.  Did not take temperature at that time.  Got back into bed with 2 blankets and a comforter and still couldn&#39;t sleep.  Got up a 7AM - temp 102.2, shaking less but still  feeling cold, body was hot to touch.  I had a bad headache and body aches and stiffness were still there. I noticed at that time  that I had a bright red flush on both cheeks and my nose that was hot to the touch.  Took 600mg of Ibuprofen.  Went back to bed feeling terrible.  At 12 noon I got back up and temp was down to 99.7.  Headache, body aches, stiffness, and &#34;red flush&#34; still on cheeks and nose.  Went back to bed.  Took more Ibuprofen at 7pm - temp was down to 98.7.  Headache was better, body aches improved.  Flushed hot face was still present.  Went to  sleep at 11:30PM  and slept for 10 hours.  Today, 03/06/21, all symptoms improved, no fever, redness of face is still present but less.

                                                about two hours after injection,  I experienced headache,  then mild dizziness,  then extreme dizziness,  then sudden overwhelming fatigue,  then swollen eyes and eyelids,  then chills and elevated heart rate,  with pounding.    I had to cancel the class I was supposed to teach,  because I would not have been safe to drive to campus.  I slept from approximately 2:30 pm on March 8 until 8:30 am today,  March 9,   all symptoms continuing,  with bathroom breaks, a couple of short reports to family members who were watching out for me,  and one  2-hour window during which I ate a small meal,  went back to bed,  and read part of a book.    During bathroom breaks I took more antronex,  some milk thistle,  and some glutathione,  which seemed to at least temporarily reduce dizziness and eye/eyelid swelling.  At one point I took some hawthorne tincture because I was concerned about the heart pounding.    Today I woke up feeling symptom-free,  but by 2 pm I was compelled by sudden fatigue to take a two-hour nap.   After that I felt better,  and I think I am now fine,  at 7:45 pm on 3/9/21.    I am happy to have gotten the Janssen vaccine,  because it is one and done!

                                                Had vaccine at 2:15 in the afternoon on 4/1/2021. That night in bed had mild itching on tops of both legs, thought it was dry skin.  Next morning I noticed red splotches on both legs from top of thigh to just below knee, front and sides (not on back of legs). That night about 10:30 I woke up with severe itching and hives on the same areas of both legs.  Bumps and red splotches and very hot.  Called Hospital and told me to take a Benadryl and go to ER if I experienced swelling of tongue or difficulty breathing.  I had neither.  I only had Cetirizine Hydrochloride 10 mg so I took one of those. Itching went away in about 1/2 hour.  Got Benadryl next day and Cortisone cream.  Red splotches are lessening each day but definitely still there.  It doesn&#39;t itch during the day only at night. So I am still taking the Benadryl before bed.  I had no other side effects besides the hives.  No fever, no headache, no body ache, no pain at injection side, no chills.  The vaccine did sting when going in and lasted a few minutes after.  I had no other changes that might cause this. Didn&#39;t work outside, clothes the same, eating the same, nothing different that would trigger this.
