                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Six hours after I received the vaccine I began to feel full body muscle aches and shivers. I took 2 Advil. I went to bed at 9:30 p.m. and woke up at 11:30 p.m. feeling as though I had slept 8 hours because I had a 102 fever. My face was burning from the heat and I was shaking. I took two more Advil. About 30 minutes later I threw up. I waited 30 more minutes and threw up again. As a result, of having Addison&#39;s disease, I have an emergency steroid injection that I use during crises such as this. I took my shot and immediately began feeling slightly better. I was able to go back to bed and at some point the fever went down overnight. I am currently feeling weak and with no fever. I also have a slight headache.

I also was experiencing a heavy chest and shortness of breath. All but one of the adverse events went away after 24-36 hours - the shortness of breath and shallow breathing have persisted up through today. I am very aware of my breathing and how my chest feels tight, like I&#39;m not getting enough air.

                                                Patient was administered vaccine and told to wait the 15 minute monitoring period. After about 4 minutes, I heard her say &#34;I&#39;m not feeling right.&#34; I went to where she was sitting and asked &#34;are you ok?&#34; and had her take some slow, deep breaths. I then saw her eyes roll back and she lost consciousness. Thankfully, I was there and grabbed her as she toppled from the chair. I told the staff to call 911 and supported her neck and body in the chair. I could tell she was breathing and she was sweating profusely. I held her and spoke to her, and after about 15 seconds, she began to come out of it. After about a minute she was alert and orientated again.  I had her slowly sip a little water. The EMTs arrived in about 5 minutes and the assessed her vitals. She indicated that this was the first time anything like this had happened to her. They advised that since she had fainted, she should go to the hospital for observation, but she declined, stated that she felt fine at that point. Since she was driving, I insisted that she remain another one-half hour before leaving. During that time she drank more water and alternately sat and walked around the pharmacy. She did indicate that she had drank a protein shake that morning, but not eaten. I advised her to in the future, tell her doctor and/or any immunizer about the event. She left, stating that she was feeling fine, and I called her several hours later to make sure that she had indeed gotten home ok. She again said that she felt fine.

Her dizziness became worse and I got the Epi Pen ready.   A few minutes later, she asked to lie down due to her dizziness.   I assisted her and had my tech call 911.   She had no trouble breathing but did develop tingling in her hands and a blotchy red rash on her chest.  The paramedics arrived and checked her vitals which they said were fine.  They took her out to the ambulance as a precaution.

For the next hour, I experienced nausea, headache, and worsening fever. I was shaking, had body aches and intense chills. I went to sleep at 10:30pm with a fever of 101.4 and had a fever until 8am the next morning. I experienced a terrible headache throughout the next day and felt extremely exhausted.

I was in tears for about 14 hours in excruciating pain due to the muscle aches and I am still having random hurts of sharp muscle and joint pain.

I took the afternoon off work and came home and slept 3 hours. Still felt groggy and sore after. Felt more normal the next morning. My left arm is still sore two days post vaccination.

                                                About five hours after the vaccine injection, at around 11 PM, I began to feel cold and achy, which soon led to body chills all over. It felt like I could not get warm no matter how many extra blankets I added. This soon led to a fever. I was in an out of sleep for the next few hours and woke up around 2:30 AM. At that point the fever had broken and I was sweating. I still had body aches, which I think was due to my body being tensed up for some many hours, and I had a splitting headache, as well. At around 4:30 AM, I woke up again, with a very sore arm a terrible headache still. I got up and took 400 mg of Ibuprofen and went back to sleep. At 7 AM my alarm went off and all adverse effects seemed to be gone other than a sore arm. The sore arm last for about 6 days.

                                                Injection technique seemed poor as it was the most painful vaccination I&#39;ve ever received, and upper arm became tight and achy immediately. Soreness lingered but the sharper pain went away shortly after. About 8-10 hours later I began feeling nauseous and lightheaded. 12 hours after vaccine I had trouble falling asleep, overcome with nausea and chills.  This turns into sweating and insomnia the rest of the night. The following day I felt better, but the next night (and following one) I continued feeling a bit sick. Currently (3 days later) my upper arm is still very sore and I have lots of muscle/joint aches throughout my whole body.

I managed to doze off for about an hour before I was woken up again by a migraine at midnight; dozed off again, and woke up at around 2 am with a mild fever (around 99.3 degrees). Sometime between the migraine and fever I began to develop terrible body aches as well. The first 24 hours were the worst as I was completely bedridden. The next day, 4/8/21, was better, but the body aches and migraine persisted all day while the fever broke late morning. The third day (today, 4/9/21) everything is feeling better but the migraine is still a persistent issue.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Injection site on arm hurt immediately after injection and upper arm is still sore today (3 days later). Approx 7 hours after receiving vaccine I experienced a sudden onset of overall body aches and joint pain specifically in my knees. It was kind of severe- even my skin was hurting when I got goosebumps. A fever came on after that and I was shivering, cold, sweaty. Approx 11 hours after injection I began to experience a severe headache and sleepiness. Symptoms continued overnight and disturbed my sleep, but were relieved somewhat by taking ibuprofen. By the next morning (after sleeping 14 hours) I was only feeling tired, arm soreness, and headache (no more fever, chills, body aches). All symptoms except arm soreness cleared up rather suddenly, approx 24 hours after they came on (which was approx 31 hours after injection).

I&#39;ve experienced chills and hot flashes in waves throughout March 11th.  I took my temperature for the first time at 4PM on March 11th and I have a low grade fever of 99.6. degrees Fahrenheit.

                                                About 7-8 minutes later I started feeling pressure in the  right side of my head. It went away a bit. I was walking after the 15 minutes and started feeling weird in my face, I just sat in my car and waited because I had to drive.  I started feeling numbness under my eye and down the rest of my face. The thing that worried me the most I had so much pressure under my eye like it was inside my brain.  The numbness and pain caused me to freak out.  I went to back to the convention center to let them know, they brought the Paramedic to me they started checking me and doing a work up. They told me I wasn&#39;t a life threatening emergency and my vitals were ok. They offered to take me to the ER and I declined and I decided to leave because I have been there for 1hr 45mins. I felt like my symptoms were at 70%. When I got home I freaked out again because the numbness didn&#39;t go away and my face looked like it was a little lower and had a panic attack and went to the ER. They checked on me and told me I didn&#39;t have a stroke. They told me It was a side effect to the vaccine. They told me to follow up with the Neurologist if I have any more symptoms, I have an appointment with them in a couple weeks. I&#39;m a little concerned because there is a minor pain that I didn&#39;t have before on my right side and it worries me.

                                                Around 4 pm I was starting to feel a little sore. By 4:30 pm I had some major chills that turned into hot flashes. At around 4:30 pm I took 400mg of Ibuprofen. For 1 hour I was fighting a fever and chill spells that rapidly changed during that 1 hour time period, ending at 5:30 pm. Within that time I had major acks in my back and neck. I also experience sinus pressure and pins and needs in my ears and behind my ears. After 5:30 pm I did feel significantly better and now are 8:00 pm I feel exhausted, my head hurts and my ears feel like they weigh a pound each. Hope that was helpful. Thanks for doing what you&#39;re doing.

                                                After receiving the shot, I was required to sit down for 15 minutes. About 5 minutes in, I started to become dizzy, my vision started blacking out, my hearing was muffled, I became clammy, sweaty, and experienced mental disorientation. It became harder for me to breathe, but I never struggled to take a breath. I drank some water and waited for the symptoms to subside. I remained seated and these symptoms went away within 5 minutes. After feeling better for about 5 minutes, I felt cold and was shivering. The woman sitting next to me was completely fine after her shot. I&#39;ve since felt a slight burning sensation on my skin in areas that I have scratched lightly. I&#39;m also experiencing strange feelings throughout my body- specifically my head, leg, and hand. It feels like I can feel something in each area for a bit and then it subsides after several minutes.

                                                I had the Janssen covid shot yesterday. The shot stung a little and made my arm sore. Later on in the evening I became tired (so far nothing I didn&#39;t assume would happen) so I took a nap. When I woke up, my arm stung worse than when I had the shot and the pain kept shooting up my shoulder into my neck. I went back to sleep, thinking it was just normal vaccine stuff. When I woke up this morning, I had chills, a fever of 101.7, and muscle aches. My body feels like I have a sunburn all over it. My right arm feels like it was stung by a scorpion. I feel dizzy and nauseous, and I have head fog. I feel the exact same way I did when I had COVID19, but with my arm hurting so bad, anything that barely touches it (such as clothes) shoots a stinging pain up my neck

It was like an asthma attack, but normally my asthma attacks are caused by a sinus infection. This was just shortness of breath and gasping for air.  I used my rescue inhaler with increasing frequency over the course of the following week. By March 12, I had to use my nebulizer. I used the nebulizer once on March 12, twice on March 13, twice on March 14, and I finally went to urgent care on March 15 when the nebulizer stopped helping. Urgent care was unable to help due to covid protocols, so they put me on oxygen for 5 minutes and transferred me to the ER.  At the ER, by the time I got to the ER, my breathing had normalized. I was given prednisone on site, as well as a prescription for 5 days. I had a chest xray done that returned completely normal.

                                                At the time of injection, it was pretty painful and thus sent my body into a shock less than 5 mins after receiving my dose. My vision went white and I was very light-headed and hot/sweaty.  A nurse came with me outside to monitor and I was feeling back to normal in 15 minutes. This is something that happens when I experience a high amount of pain, so just reporting for others who maybe have low blood pressure issues.  At about 8pm, other side effects started to set in. I first experienced a headache, then experienced soreness/ache-y-ness  in my back. Around 8:30, I started to feel light headed again and soon my whole body felt ache-y. I quickly developed chills where I felt so cold that I was uncontrollably shaking and felt very sore/stiff. I have been laying under a heated blanket for the last hour and a half and am finally feeling better with no more shaking  or chills. I still have soreness throughout my body and a headache, but I took ibuprofen around 8:30pm.

                                                I received my shot at 3:30 pm on Friday 3/5/21. Around 9 pm I started experiencing extreme body aches all over that felt like my body was &#34;fighting&#34; against itself. I also experienced chills. I had a hard time sleeping from the pain. The next morning a headache started and progressed into a migraine. I could not get up or open my eyes from how bad the migraine was. I took extra strength Tylenol for the pain with little relief. On Saturday evening the symptoms started to get better and turned more into a headache. I still had the headache on Sunday but it was better after taking the Tylenol. On Monday my arm is now sore (it wasn&#39;t sore prior).

The day after I recieved the covid vaccine Janssen, I started noticing the injection site getting red and swollen. By the next day it had grown in size and was itching rather badly. I could sleep from how badly it was itching and burning. It has been 6 days since I got the vaccine and it&#39;s still large and swollen and really itchy. I have been taking ibuprofen for the pain and using benadryl for the itching.

                                                Around 8 hours after the shot I started to experience fatigue, body aches, uncontrollable body shakes, blueish lips and sweating (which to me indicated I had a fever). After taking some Advil my lips returned to normal and the body shakes stopped although it was hard to regulate my body temperature. I was sweating but felt cold. The worst of the symptoms seemed to last around 13 hours after they had started (so about 7pm on 3/25 to about 8am on 3/26). It&#39;s now been around 30 hours and I&#39;m feeling better but still fatigued and have soreness in my left arm where I received the injection.

                                                I received the vaccine at 1:30 pm in the afternoon on 3/22/21 and immediately afterwards I felt fine. I waited my 15 minutes and had no signs of a reaction and was free to go. Later in the afternoon, around 3:15 pm, I began to feel a little fatigued and my arm was sore. Around 6:00 pm that same night, I developed a low grade temp of 99.8, I was very fatigued, had achiness all over, as well as my arm was very warm and tender.  I was unable to sleep through the night of 3/22/21 into 3/23/21 and got out of bed around 4: 30 am on 3/23/21 and had to call into work due to the pain. The pain was not an achiness but sharp throughout my whole body. Around 9:00 am, I took a pain reliever and was able to sleep for a few hours. Upon waking up around 1:30-2:00 pm, I was still hurting and was then nauseated as well. I tried to drink water and ate a few crackers to settle my stomach with no relief. At 5:15 pm on 3/23/21, I went to the bathroom and got in the shower to try to help with the pain. After a few minutes in the shower, I became extremely lightheaded and felt like I was going to be sick. I sat down in the bathtub and hollered for my mother to come help me because at this point, I felt like I needed to go to the hospital. Upon sitting down in the bathtub, I began to profusely vomit and started to lose feeling in my legs. My mother entered the bathroom and I explained what was happening and soon after my hands contracted and were stuck in an abnormal position. The pain was unbearable and I was unable to move them from that position. I was unable to get myself out of the bathtub so my mom then called for an ambulance. These symptoms occurred somewhere around 5:20-5:21 pm and EMS was called at 5:22 pm. After a few minutes, I was able to regain movement of my legs but my hands and fingers were still contracted and unmovable. I was able to help my mother enough to put my clothes on and to make my way outside to the front porch to get fresh air. After getting outside, I was accompanied by my mother and my neighbor whom is a nurse. My neighbor looked at my hands and noticed they were discolored and she attempted to straighten out my fingers to no avail. The pain in my fingers was sharp and excruciating but there was also a pins and needle type pain as well. I remained outside until EMS arrived. I was then transported to Hospital where I was seen in the ER for this. Upon arrival to the ER, the physician ordered labs and fluids and stated that apparently he had seen at least 2 other cases that day with a similar reaction to the vaccine. He explained that I was having an adverse reaction to the vaccine and that my hands should return to normal within 24-48 hours. I was then discharged home. As of 3/24/21, I was able to straighten my left hand out and my right hand, my fingers would straighten out, but they would return to a curled resting position. As of 3/25/21, I returned to work and I have some weakness in both hands with a slight discoloration of each hand as well. I am a nurse and work in an office and the physicians in my office commented on the color of skin upon seeing them. I was still very achy and fatigued. My arm was still sore and tender as well. As of today, 3/26/21, I am still achy as well as tired. My right hand has improved some but still returns to a curled resting position. The color of my hands has improved as well. I am a nurse and have seen many things throughout my career. This experience has been absolutely terrifying and I still have no answers as to why this happened to my body. I did my part by being vaccinated and was terrified that I was going to lose my life to it. I pray this does not happen to anyone else.

I already imagined that the fever was starting. 3 hours later I got home and took my temperature, it was 101 F.   the fever lasted more than 15 hours. I didn?t  take any medication. I put cold cloths on my head, bathed and rested. the headache was very intense. So far I have discomfort from that but the fever has already stopped. The most striking thing was the allergic reaction that I began to have around midnight and it continued until today. they were hives all over the body. swelling and itching and redness. Finally after 24hs after vaccine I took an anti allergy called levocetirizine  cause itching won?t stop.

                                                Prior to recieving her vaccine , the patient stated she was nervous and has anxiety.  After recieving the vaccine she said she felt fine. I told her to stay there for few minutes make sure she was ok. Her husband was getting the vaccine next so I went to start reviewing his paperwork. 5 minutes later he said she didnt feel good. She said she felt like she was going to pass out and wanted to sit or lay down on the floor. Her husband and I helped lower her to the ground and she lay on her side. I asked if she wanted water or anything she said yes. I got her a cold water and she put it against her forehead and said she just needed a minute.   After 10 minutes she got up and sat in the chair and said she felt better.  I then gave her husband his vaccine.   10 minutes later as they wanted after his he said she did not feel well again. She was laying on the floor and said she did not feel like she woulf pass out but just didnt feel right. I asked if she wanted me to call 911 she said yes, just to be checked out.  They came with in 5 minutes and then she said she felt better and was sitting again.   They talked to her and watched her stand up. They checked her pulse and said it was normal and her color was good. She ended up not going with the ambulance and agreed it was probably jsut anxiety  / panic attack.  She walked away fine and also stated she needed to eat dinner.

                                                I woke up around 5:30 with a high fever. I went to the restroom and on the way back I passed out and was unresponsive for a few seconds (10-20 seconds). I have since being running a fever, breaking out in a sweat, had a severe migraine, and body aches and joint aches. It has been over 24 hours since the vaccine and am still having side affects.

                                                Injection site soreness and somewhat severe flu-like symptoms starting the evening after the vaccine. Flu-like symptoms included chills, sweats, fever, achy muscles, dry cough. Symptoms persisted all night and most of the next day. Symptoms were treated with Dayquil, which helped a lot. Symptoms seem gone today, approximately 30 hours after symptom onset. Injection site tenderness persists, but is only noticeable if I poke it.

A few minutes later she fainted and fell out of the chair onto the floor. We helped her up to a sitting position and gave her a bottle of water and an ice pack.  The right side of her forehead appeared red from apparent hit on the floor when she fainted.  We had her wait on the floor for about 30 minutes to ensure she remained conscious.  Patient reported an ache on her forehead at site of hit.  She was also sweating and reported feeling hot. Patient had a partner with her who agreed to escort her to an urgent care clinic in the same building as the pharmacy. Store manager in charge took the patient to the urgent care clinic by wheelchair to be examined.

Then all day of 3/27 I experienced lesser degrees of all of the same symptoms. By the night of 3/27 I felt completely normal.

Concerned my bone was hit with a too long vaccine needle. Had chills/fever evening of 4/4/2021 into morning of 4/6/2021?had to take off work. Have had neurological symptoms ongoing with ?brain fogginess? since 4/5/2021. On 4/6/2021, began to see flashes/spots of light in vision of left eye, which worsened through today. Took off afternoon from work and went to an eye clinic to have eye dilated and looked at, but the spots in vision continue through reporting time (4/7/2021, 5pm CT).

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I began to feel nauseous, almost like being car sick while looking at my phone. I also began to feel tightness in my chest. After my 15 minutes were up I asked the administrator of my shot if it was normal that I felt dizzy/chest tightness. They said it was probably fine and just to monitor my  symptoms. I went and sat in my car a few min and I began to feel very strange, it seemed very bright out, I felt weak, and my eyes felt very heavy. I wanted to get home so I started driving but on the highway, my heart beat was very fast and I began to feel like I couldn&#39;t swallow. At one point felt as though I might be about to choke so I pulled over because I thought I was going to have to dial 911 as my throat was feeling like it was closing up. I tried swallowing a few times with great effort and after a few minutes the sensation started to lessen. My throat hadn&#39;t closed up completely, however it did feel like it had swelled up.

                                                About 6 hours after vaccination on 3/8, flu-like symptoms: chills, weakness, fatigue, headache. That lasted into the following ~1.5 days and was relieved with Tylenol and bed rest. Mild nausea on 3/9-3/10. The most concerning possible adverse event started on the evening of 3/12. I noticed my achilles area was itchy after taking a shower that night. I woke up the following morning on 3/13 VERY itchy on my left arm and ankles. I started to break out in hives on my lower legs and bilateral arms into the afternoon. I took Benadryl as directed on the package to try and relieve the hives. In the evening on 3/13 I tried taking a lukewarm bath with 1/2 cup of baking soda and epsom salt. After soaking for about 30 minutes, the hives had worsened and about 65% of my body was covered in hives. I called my primary care&#39;s emergency line that night and was prescribed 40mg Pepcid x 7 days and a Methylprednisolone pack to take in addition to the Benadryl. I took the 40mg Pepcid along with Benadryl and was able to relieve most of the hives. I did not take the methylprednisolone at all. I did wake up in the middle of the night with a scratchy throat and took another Benadryl to relieve that. The following morning on 3/14 I woke up and had some hives on my hands that disappeared that early afternoon without having to take Benadryl. In the evening on 3/14 at around 6pm the hives started to reappear on bilateral arms as well as legs. I took the 40mg Pepcid as well as Benadryl and the hives did not completely disappear before bed. The following morning on 3/15 it appears that the hives had disappeared. They did not reappear the following evening but I still took the 40mg Pepcid the evening of 3/15. Today is 3/16 and I have continued to be hive-free. One other detail to note, on 3/15 at around 4 in the afternoon I took an old supplement - Cranberry with Vitamin C. So I am not sure if this reaction was related to the expired supplement, the vaccine, or both.

                                                At 0700, a splotchy red rash appeared in my wrists and feet. It was not raised up and had an irregular border and was very very itchy. By 1000, the rash was splotchy up to my ankles and onto my forearm. By 1400, the entirety of my forearms were solid red rash, and I had large splotches on my calves, thighs, and upper arm. By 1800, the rash was only on my shoulder area, but lower body was still very red. My entire right leg from ankle to hip was red splotchy and my left leg from knee up. I had 2 splotches on my hips. I took 1 benadryl at this time and went to bed. I woke up on 3/18/21 with a few light splotches on my chest but no where else. This faded By 1000 and I do not have any rash now.

                                                About 24 hours later, I noticed a rash the size of quarter. On Tuesday, the rash was bigger and it was swollen underneath - the lump underneath it was the size of a golf ball. Wednesday and Thursday - Nurse measured it had rash top was 7 cm and the lump underneath was the size of my palm (much bigger). It was really painful and really itchy.  On Thursday, I did a telehealth video chat - and I showed it to the doctor and that&#39;s when I went to the clinic where the nurse measured it. Treatment was given: Steroid cream - called Triamcinolone. I used it that night and by the next day the redness had gone down 50% and the lump decrease, also. I have been using it twice a day since Thursday. Today the redness is gone and the lump is maybe the size of a quarter.  It&#39;s about 90% better but not completely gone.

                                                After being administered the vaccine at 7:12 am, when the nurse stood me up and started to walk me to the holding area, I became dizzy, my legs got weak, and there was a loud ringing in my ears. I nearly collapsed as I reached the seat in the holding area they were taking me to. I placed one 0.5MG tablet of my prescription Alprazolam in my mouth and waited for the nurse to bring water. They took me via wheelchair from the holding area to a secluded spot behind a curtain. There, I laid on a cot, received cold water, and a nurse talked to me while I recovered. It felt like I was having an anxiety attack, which has never happened to me after getting a shot before. Fitbit heart rate data shows my heart rate at 105 BPM at 7:00 am (going through the admission process, walking around the facility), 83 BPM at 7:10 am, 79 BPM at 7:15 am, 74 BPM at 7:20 am. Between 8:15 am and 1:25 pm, my heart rate remained between 63 and 89 BPM. My arm was sore and my skin hurt (an issue that I have when I feel very stressed). Additional symptoms arose around 1:35 pm. I began going through cycles of chills, sweating and overheating. My heart rate ranged from 127 BPM and 93 BPM for the remainder of the night. I took Tylenol at 7:07 PM to help with my fever.

I woke up to my husband holding my head and yelling my name. I had been seizing and had bitten my tongue. I was very white and nauseous and cold and shaky. They gave me water and a cold pack. The seizure probably only lasted for 5 seconds but it&#39;s hard to say. I felt very fatigued afterwards. I stayed for 10 more min and drank water and then they sent me on my way.

I called my Doctor the following day and she said it was a normal reaction, if it get&#39;s worse to call her again. I called her again because it got worse, my neck got swollen. left arm was trembling, lymph nodes were swollen, leg leg was pulsating. I started having chills and hot flashes ( I still have some till this day). My Doctor recommended seeing a specialist- Neurologist, Infectious Disease Dr.  The Neurologist said he can see where I get the trembles but does not  want to put me on medication and see if it goes away on it&#39;s own. I have a follow up with him regarding trembles, headache, flashing in my eyes. The Infectious Disease Dr. I&#39;m following up her her again regarding my arm swelling, they prescribed me steroids but had not gone down.  Since all of this I have been very fatigue, this is everyday.

Shortness of breath started the next day on Sunday , extreme, far beyond normal asthma or any asthma attack. Went to urgent care on Tuesday- they said it was likely a side effect of j &amp;J and tested me for COVID, kidney disease other things, all came back negtative. Apparently I wasn?t the first person they had seen with shortness of breath. Blood in cough and spit on Wednesday after 2.5 days of  shortness of breath. Dizziness (extreme) throughout and chest pain, sternum hurt, chest tightness. Went to Er. They ran a lot of tests and they too said they had seen others with shortness of breath from j and j. They ruled out many things like pneumonia, a birth control blood clot, any lung diseases with X-rays and blood tests. I was given torkeril to ease the chest pain and tightness which it did. Blood stopped coming up in tissues. Doctor said likely inflammatory reaction to the vaccine in lungs, (I have a piece of paper proving that) and cartilage and sternum., which hurt extremely when he touched it. Blood was likely from burst capillaries from overcompensation from trying to breathe. Recommended I return if more blood came up, which it hasn?t.  Shortness of breath has not subsided. I can?t even hold a phone app without being winded. So email back, don?t call.

My temperature about an hour later was 105. I took 1000 mg of Tylenol right away and put a cold rag on my head and tried to go to sleep. A couple hours later my fever started breaking, when it was 102.7 I was a sweaty mess and extremely hot and puked a lot.  My fever and other symptoms went away within about 7 hours after my fever started breaking.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Mid Saturday night I woke up to chills and was shaking so bad I couldn&#39;t fall back asleep even after adding another layer of clothes and blanket. Sunday morning I was still very cold and tired from not sleeping. I developed body aches but they were everywhere not just my arm. I was very fatigued and didn&#39;t have an appetite. The worst part was getting a migraine with extreme light sensitivity. I couldn&#39;t stand to be around any windows without blinds. I spent the day in my bedroom sleeping with the curtains closed and an eye mask on. By that night, the migraine had subsided but I was adding hot flashes to the problem list. Had a pretty restless night again on Sunday. Woke up Monday to the light sensitivity back but not as severe. I took the day off work because I couldn&#39;t handle looking at a computer screen all day. By about 1pm I was feeling mostly back to normal. My arm is still sore near the injection site and I&#39;m a bit fatigued at times but those are the only things remaining.

                                                Immediate soreness in arm - headache after a couple hours. By 9:00pm, I was freezing cold but body warm. Chills lasted for hours and couldn&#39;t stop shaking, so took Tylenol at 12:15am. Around 1:00am the chills subsided. Around 2:00am fever burnt off, sweating and hot. Couldn&#39;t sleep the rest of the night. Slept from 8am-10am and woke with just headache. Took Tylenol around 10:30am to help with headache and it did start to subside. Was mostly fatigued and muscle aches the rest of the day until 6pm when I started to get cold again. Feels like the fever and chills are coming back and it&#39;s currently 7:30pm, so assuming it&#39;ll be another night of this.

                                                3/6/21  This is a 32-year-old female who is receiving her first Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine and shortly afterwards developed some throat itching and tightness.  She was given a milligram of epinephrine by intramuscular injection by retired emergency physician there and then transported by ambulance here for further evaluation.  Says her tongue felt a little swollen as well but she denies any respiratory symptoms.  Her voice sounds crackly to her.  She denies any pruritus or rashes.  She has had multiple allergic reactions to medications in the past but never having to be admitted overnight.  One episode however did occur while she was hospitalized and receiving treatment.  She has never had to be intubated.  She has had isolated urticaria without oral or throat symptoms and vice versa.  At this point she says she does feel somewhat better. She is given IV dexamethasone and observed here.  At 1 point she complained of it complaint complained of it feeling like a tightening in the back of her throat was worsening.  She is given an additional intramuscular dose of epinephrine with epinephrine and on reexamination had no significant change in physical findings or her phonation.  This occurred again and she was given viscous lidocaine with minimal improvement in her symptoms.  After several hours of observation without objective worsening but continued complaint of feeling increasing tightness in her throat, CT imaging of the neck is performed to assess the soft tissue structures.  No abnormalities or indication of significant retropharyngeal or paralaryngeal edema or airway compromise present. Given the possibility of some laryngeal muscle or parapharyngeal muscle spasm as him, she was given Flexeril.  After some discussion with her I did indicate to her that I felt it would be safe to return home but offered admission for observation as well.  She indicated she was comfortable returning home for continued observation.  She will be continued on steroids and antihistamines and is given additional Flexeril by prescription if this does seem to help her symptoms.  If no improvement over the next 2 to 3 days and follow-up either with her primary providers through facility or Dr.  3/7/21: Return to ED. The patient is in no respiratory distress.  She has no wheezing.  On physical exam her throat lips and tongue look fine.  I think she is not a had another allergic reaction, rebounded from yesterday.  She is not on any type of steroids sinus syndrome with some Decadron.  And she is allergic to Benadryl but she can take Claritin if she wants.  Her CBC and chemistry were normal.  I went back to evaluate her and she still getting fluids and now she is complaining of shooting pain down her left leg from the EpiPen.  Again she has this regional complex pain syndrome that could be part of that but there is nothing I can do for this at this time.  In terms of her allergic reaction she feels much better her throat feels normal.  We will send her out with prescription for Decadron and EpiPen and if she gets worse she will come back and will follow up admit her.

                                                Currently pregnant due May 31. I got the vaccine at 4 pm on Wednesday. At around 6pm I started to get a headache, I took 2 tylenol but it continued to get progressively worse. By 7 I was starting to get really fatigued and fell asleep. I woke up around 8 or 9 still fatigued with body aches and a headache. The body aches and headache continued to worsen, but due to pregnancy I could not take any more tylenol. Around midnight I got out of bed to use the bathroom and immediately started violently shivering. It continued for a few minutes after I got back into bed, it did cause a lot of pain in my joints and muscles. A few hours later I woke up very hot and sweaty. The next day (Thursday) I continued to feel very fatigued with body aches and a headache to the point where I had to stop working even though I work from home. The following day (Friday) I was still mildly fatigued and had some body aches, and my brain felt very foggy so I took off work again. I regularly checked my temperature during this time and did not have a fever.

Swelling did not respond to Benadryl. No other allergy symptoms (hives elsewhere, etc.) - Filing this report on Day 16 after vaccine and, while swelling has improved, itching persists and I still have a walnut-sized mass of firm tissue under skin near injection site and patch of redness/discoloration on deltoid. Have been checked by doctor who ensured that reaction is indeed dermatological allergic reaction (not infection).

                                                Most websites said 1-2 days for side effects to kick in but I was rocked pretty hard within the first 12 hours. The biggest symptoms I had were severe body aches, debilitating chills, fluctuating fever, headache, and no appetite.  4/1/21: * 11:15am: Vaccine administered * 12pm-6pm: Arm soreness, feeling cold/experiencing some chills, minor headache and stomach ache (I felt a little off but couldn?t tell if it was real or in my head) * 5:30pm: I walk home from work, which takes about about 35 minutes. Regret the decision about 10 mins from home due to onset body aches and fatigue  * 6pm: I go straight to bed freezing with crippling chills, body aches, and a headache * 8pm: Extreme nausea kicks in, I take Advil and cannot stomach more than one bite of food; still experiencing chills and body pain * 9pm: 100.7 fever, the chills subside and I start to get hot * 10:15pm: I finally eat some food, drink more water, body still aches, start to get chilly again  * 10:45pm: My fever is down to 99.3, my ears really hurt, like, ear-infection-style pain  * 11:15pm: 12ish hours post-vaccine, I have severe body aches, I alternate between really hot and cold, take more Advil and go to bed (finally fall asleep at midnight)  4/2/21: * 6:15am: Wake up; I spent the night tossing and turning with extreme night sweats. At this point I still have a pretty bad headache and painful body aches, specifically in my lower back and legs; fall back asleep * 8am-9am: Wake up and take more Advil. My whole body hurts. Toss and turn for a bit more. Small fever?99 degree temperature. Make coffee but have absolutely no appetite. * 9am-10am: So sweaty, fever is fully breaking * 11am: No more fever, slight headache, and body aches seem to be subsiding * 11:45am: Almost exactly 24 hours later and feeling good, comparatively speaking. Finally eat a bagel * 5:30pm: After lunch, I took a nap. My body aches have completely subsided, no fever. I still have a small headache and my ears still ache. But overall, I feel pretty normal! Just a little tired but probably from lack of sleep last night.

Took tylenol for the residual headache and am feeling mostly normal minus a little soreness at injection site at 8am.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after her Janssen COVID19 vaccine the patient started coughing and felt her throat tightening.  I had her sit down and told her I was giving her an Epinephrine 0.3mg shot.  The shot was given in her left thigh and within a minute her throat cleared. I gave her a bottle of water. She said her heart was racing but it eventually slowed down.  I asked her if she wanted me to call 911, she felt it was not necessary.  Patient sat in our waiting room &amp;  checked in on her every few minutes, her symptoms improved.  Patient was here over 45 minutes.  She wanted to go &amp; felt fine.  I told her to call us or go to the emergency room if any problems arise.

                                                Around 3:00pm on 3/7/21 I began to feel a little tired. But 3:45pm I was experiencing muscle pain through my body at only continued to get worse. At 4:30pm I took 400mg of ibuprofen since sitting, walking, and lying down were all painful. Relief came around 5:30pm and I was able to nap for an hour. At 6:30pm I awoke and attempted to eat, as I was beginning to feel nauseous. At 8:30pm I laid down again, my symptoms returning and worsening. I was now experiencing chills with my muscle pain and a headache. Pain was located throughout my body and my skin was sensitive to the touch. At 10:30pm I began shaking violently and struggled to feel warm, despite my skill feeling hot. My temperature was not taken. Another 400mg of ibuprofen was taken and one 350mg chewable of Tums anti-acid was eaten. It was not until 12:30am that I was able to sleep again.  The morning of 3/8/21 I was still fatigued and sore. Moving was difficult and painful and nausea was still present, and my headache returned. I was unable to eat despite trying. At 10:00am I took two tablets of Excedrin Migrain and napped for almost two hours. Currently, my muscle aches are minimal and my headache has improved. This may however be due to the medication.

Area is very swollen and it has not decreased in swelling in several days despite applying ice, taking ibuprorfen, and also applying heat. There is also a knot. I massaged the area to try to loosen the knot. However, I noticed it gets more swollen instead of getting better. The pain subsides momentarily. However, it returns. It is affecting my range of motion, I cannot lift my arm above my head as it causes extreme pain.

Third day - head ache  and muscle fatigue   5th day- starting at 4am. I woke up with skin itching. I noticed a rash on my arm where injection was. It then spread to back, other arm, legs, neck , ankles and knees. Took Benadryl and Zyrtec by doctors orders. The rash went away- but then six hours later returned and has grown. I also have to take more Benadryl since the same amount has not helped the rash disappear.

At midnight I woke up extremely hot, as if I had a fever (I didn&#39;t confirm this with a thermometer, I was just extremely hot and sweaty) and I had a very severe, painful headache that lasted at least 30 minutes until I took two acetaminophen pills. I also experienced the usual muscle pains. All symptoms were gone by Saturday morning upon waking.

                                                Yesterday I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I was the last appointment, so they observed me for 5 minutes, and I left. After riding in the car for a few minutes, I noticed that I was having a hard time breathing and my throat felt like it was starting to swell. By that time, the clinic was closed, so I went to the emergency room just in case and sat in my car since they didn&#39;t allow people to sit in the waiting room because if covid.  It started becoming increasingly difficult to breathe, and I was feeling more and more swelling of my throat and tongue. I was having a lot of dizziness, nausea, facial flushing, palpitations, and some mild confusion. I then started getting numbness in the bottom half of my face. Over time, the numbness spread, mostly staying on the left side of my body (face, scalp, lower arms and legs, left side on tongue and inside of mouth). I also started getting a prickling burning pain sensation for brief periods of time where I had numbness. I had decided that if my breathing worsened at all, I would go to the er even though I can&#39;t afford it.   After about an hour and a half, my breathing started to feel less constricted and like there was less resistance. The swelling in my throat was mostly in the upper throat where I had difficulty swallowing but not as much difficulty breathing. The numbness continued to get worse and was sometimes disappearing and reappearing in the same spot.  At 9:30 pm we went to go get some benadryl. I continued feeling less and less swelling and having an easier time breathing. At that point, I went home. Once I was home, my breathing continued to improve and the numbness started to dissipate.  In the middle of the night, I started itching and getting widespread hives and getting a sharp burning pricking pain that would last a few seconds in different areas. The numbness also started coming back mostly in my face. I continued to have difficulty swallowing.  I am feeling much better today. I still feel some slight swelling in my throat when I swallow, but my breathing is fine. I&#39;m still itchy and occasionally breaking out in hives. Im having mild lower facial numbness. I&#39;m also starting to get the normal side effects of fever, headache, arm soreness, and body aches. I&#39;m taking benadryl every 4 hours.

                                                Received vaccine at approximately 12:30 pm  on 3/15/21 at 13 weeks pregnant (due date of 9/15/21). Weight and height 5&#39;0&#34;, approximates 136lbs.   During injection there was a pain from the needle insert and immediate soreness. I would describe it as more painful than the flu shot that I received in November of 2021. I was then escorted to a chair for a 15 minute observation period. I did not have any allergic reactions to the shot. I continued to feel slight soreness in my left arm for the rest of the day.  At approximately 8 pm I began to feel &#34;aches and pains&#34; similar to those during a cold and flu. I took (1) regular strength Tylenol Acetaminophen 325 mg tablet. I began to feel a little bit warm around 9-10 pm and checked my temperature with an infrared thermometer and it was slightly elevated by a degree (no exact measurement). I  went to bed at approximately 11:30 pm.   At approximately 12:45 am I woke up and took my temperature. I first used the infrared thermometer and it came back as 99.4 F. I felt very warm so I then switched to an Oral thermometer for accuracy and began to record the following: 101.1 F - 12:45am (was under blankets so got out of bed to cool off) / 100.0 F - 1:05 am / 100.9 F - 1:20 am  At 1:10am I used a cold compress (small ice pack wrapped in a kitchen towel) to cool off and then took a luke-warm shower at 1:15 am (did not wet hair). I also drank a big water bottle of water (Tap Water) probably around 500ml. The room temperature was around 74 F. I re-measured my temp at 1:40 am and it decreased to 99.3 F. I took a 2nd Tylenol tablet (same as above) at 2 am. My temperature at 2:05 am was 100.0 F.  I then went in and out of sleep and recorded my temps every time I woke up and went to the bathroom / drank more water. 98.5 F at 3:55 am / 98.4 F at 5:55 am / 99.0 at 7:25 am. At 7:30am I took a 3rd &amp; 4th Tylenol. Temp at 7:55am was 99.4F. I went back to sleep and then woke up at 9am to login remotely for work. Temp at 9:25 am was 98.7.  I then took a nap from 9:30 am to 12:00 pm (my boss told me to go to sleep after our call) and slept very soundly. When I woke up I felt a lot better. Aches and pains were no longer present and fever appeared to be gone. The worst of the symptoms were over. I then spot checked my temp a few times throughout the day: 98.0F at 12:15pm / 98.3 F at 1:40pm / 98.7 at 2:05 pm. At 2:15 pm I took a 5th Tylenol just in case. I took my last official temp at 2:20pm at 98.3 F.   At about 3pm 3/16 I had a telehealth visit with my OBGYN. She said that my symptoms were normal and everything looked ok. My test results from my 12 week sonogram I had 2 weeks prior were all OK as well. To my knowledge the baby is tracking healthy. Note that during the whole time I did not experience any symptoms related to the baby. No cramps or pains in my abdomen. I am happy to share any past or future data about my pregnancy if anyone reading this is interested in contacting me.  I then randomly measured my temp until bed but it never came back as higher than normal (didn?t write it down). Slept through the next night normal and woke up normal temp as well. I would say I was more tired than usual on 3/17 but did not have any more flu like symptoms. The only thing that remained was a soreness at the injection site. It was at the spot of injection and also kind of the general area. The pain/feeling completely went away by the end of the week 3/19.   This is a very long description of symptoms. I don?t know if it?s helpful or if anyone even read all of it. But I?m just writing it down for record.

                                                About a minute after I had the injection, my arm started hurting and it felt like hot water was coursing through my veins. I got an immediate headache that progressed into light headedness, my vision got blurry and I saw colors and then I started to lose my hearing, it felt like there was cotton in my ears. The nurses said I went pale and they called it a panic attack, but it was unlike any panic attack I have ever had in my life. I?ve had my TDAP updated a few years ago and got a flu shot and did not feel anything like this. I was rolled out of the room on a wheel chair because I was too dizzy to walk and then threw up several times into a bag and peed myself. It took about 20 minutes before I felt normal again.   The following day my arm felt numb and incredibly sore, I couldn?t raise it that far up without excruciating pain. I felt weak, fatigued and dizzy and was unable to use the bathroom. I had fever sweats and chills on and off. I was not able to sleep well, but I think that?s because of the pain in my arm.

Started experiencing fogginess and feeling cold at 1:00 am 20Mar2021. Went to bed at 1:00 and dreamed of being sick until waking up at 8:30 am 20Mar2021. Woke up and was very weak (could not push toothpaste through toothpaste tube), almost passed out in trying, so I sat on the floor. Tried getting back to bed and was extremely nauseous and started vomiting. After that, I had the sweats/fever/chills for a couple hours (until ~11:00am), and was fatigued until 4:00 pm. Spent most of the day sleeping, unable to do anything. Today, 22Mar2021, feel slight tingling on palm of left hand and fingers. Injection site is still sore and bruised

                                                I had some sort of reaction to the vaccine about 1-2 minutes after receiving it, and it was super scary and they had to call the paramedics.   After the pharmacist injected me, I felt the arm pain right away. No big deal. I walked over to the chair to sit for my 15 minutes. I was happy to be vaccinated and kind of saw it as my mini booster for my immune system that already beat COVID-19. As I sat there, the only thing I could say is, I felt a tingling cold sensation moving from my arm through me. Almost like I could feel the vaccine moving through my system. The tingling kept moving and I thought to myself, okay cool. I guess it&#39;s working. Awesome. But then my head felt cold, I felt tingling in my head, my mouth tasted like metal, saliva started to build in my mouth, I started to sweat, I felt overly sweaty all over my body, but my head felt cold and tingly.   I was staring straight ahead and everything started to go staticky, like a television set, and the static began to build and started to get starry. Everything in my vision started to fade. So I spoke out to say something weird was happening.  A man came over to talk to me and hold me up. He kept saying stuff but then my ears started ringing and I couldn&#39;t hear him anymore. I began to fade out as the stars got more intense. Then, as if it was just a mini reboot, my brain started to come back online and the picture in front of me began to fade back into view. I felt nauseous and still had a super metal taste in my mouth. They called the paramedics to give me a checkup. The metal taste in my mouth stayed the longest, but after about 45 minutes I felt well enough to go home.  On and off, I have this intense tingling inside my brain. It reminds me of a time when I was in the hospital on morphine. Just a tingling pins and needles sensation inside my head. Other than that, I am okay now. But I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s some sort of reaction because I already had COVID-19.

                                                Shot given Saturday at 12:15. Pm. Immediately neck pain started. I assumed it was from looking at my phone while I waited for the 15 minute wait to be up, but the pain never stopped, but it did move around my body. Fever every evening starting the day after the shot. Searing muscular pain since shot, worsens when fever happens, and the pain is moving throughout my body. On Monday, It is day 3 after the shot and my arm is swelling more today than any other day. Advil 400mg every 4 hours, rest, and plenty of fluids.

Once I came to my hand and arms were numb and tingling. I was sweating but cold. Ambulance was called and they took my vitals and blood sugar. Everything was normal. After about 10 mins I was able to stand and felt better after getting all of my color back. I have felt fine the rest of the day besides some fatigue and body aches.

I broke out into a cold sweat all over my body and could barely see anything or move my body and I felt very nauseous. I was nearly unconscious and barely able to talk. This lasted for about 20 minutes and then slowly started to recede after that. I felt able to stand after about 40 minutes, and was eventually able to walk out of the store and be driven home.   I am very very healthy and have no major medical conditions.

Injection site was hot to the touch and did swell a bit. The following day I went through strong waves of feeling very ill and then feeling ok for about an hour, then back to having chills, nauseous, headache, body ache, and extremely lethargic. Half way through second day I broke out in a rash all over my chest, tummy, and back. Entering into day 3 ( today ) I do feel better, but can&#39;t shake the brain fog and feelings of being tired. Rash is still present currently.

Body began to ache to the point I was in tears. Checked fever again and was at 99.9. Took more Tylenol and Ibuprophen and went to bed as much as I could. Woke up and took Tylenol the next morning. Checked temperature because I still had a pounding headache and was at 100.2, started sweating and shaking as in cold sweats. No appetite. Spent most of the day resting with most symptoms still accruing. On 3rd day I have no fever. I?m not as weak and I?m able to get around a lot better. Still a little nauseous but definitely feeling better then the previous days.

                                                Starting the morning after receiving the vaccine, the injection site was painful, red, sore, and very swollen. Every single day since (It is now 03/10 - 5 days after), the injection site welt has grown in size and redness, as well as painful to touch, warm to touch, and soreness extending down left arm. It is very similar to the &#34;COVID Arm&#34; hypersensitivity effects seen with the Moderna vaccine.

                                                Began feeling tired and developed an intense migraine around 6 hours after, went to bed several hours early (8:30 pm).  Intense started in early evening in upper arms and neck and spread through entire body.  Felt as if bones hurt.  In bed 10 hours but got little rest.  Chills and sweats.  Note that the pain is the exact same I had when I had COVID several months ago, which has flared up on and off since.  Next day symptoms are mostly gone, some tiredness and soreness remains.

                                                Was eating dinner (seasoned smoked chicken, broccoli, cauliflower, fries) and soon after, felt my lips starting to swell. I had seasonal allergies occurring that day, so I kept eating a bit longer. My tongue then started tingling. I took a dose of Children&#39;s Benadryl (all I had for Benadryl at the time). I then waited about 10 minutes before I felt my throat starting to close. We headed straight to emergency room (5 mins away). By the time I got there, I started to have a little trouble taking breaths. When I got into the trauma room moments later, I became nauseous and dry heaving.  They gave me an epinephrine shot, Benadryl, Pepto, and Prednisone.   They watched me for a few hours before release. Upon discharge, they provided me a prescription for epi-pens, famotidine, prednisone, and fexofenadine (5-day prescriptions).

                                                Numbness in throat 5 minutes after injection.   Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored but nothing substantial to report.   Monitored for a total of 30 minutes, numbness spread through mouth yet did not progress further.  Dizziness upon standing.  No additional symptoms.  Healthcare providers noted that if any progression of symptoms occur to report to the emergency room, however, no additional care was needed.     8-10 days post vaccine severe stomach pains after each meal.  Possibly related to skipping dose of methotrexate.  Pain alleviated within hours once methotrexate injection was administered.  Discussed with rheumatologist at scheduled appointment.

First day after felt slightly better, still tired and slightly light headed. Second day symptoms worsened, feeling like I was going to pass out/faint, hot/cold chills, clammy, no fever, shortness of breath, culminating in numbness and tingling in arms, legs, then chest and then hands freezing up which resulted in a panic attack. Have never had a panic attack before. Emergency services called and after checking gave a sedative and went to the ER.

                                                I got the vaccine, then was asked (due to having previous allergic reaction to Levaquin in the past, I was asked to wait 30 minutes) I got up and walked a total of 30 feet to sit in a chair. I felt completely normal, up until this point. I sat down and began to text my Mother that I had just got the vaccine &amp; I was told to wait 30 minutes, at this point (2 mins in) I felt normal. I sat my phone down on my lap and was just looking about. I began at that point (2 1/2-3 mins mark) seeing the tile floor morph; the blue tiles and the green tiles kept merging together and forming one color. Then my heart raced, immediately and I started having hot flashes that shot out my ears. My heart raced even more and at that point I had realized something wasn?t right. A National Guards member came up to me and had asked if I were okay, I explained I was not and something was not right. They took me to a medical area and made me take deep breaths, and made me drink some water. My BP was high, and my Pulse Ox had dropped slightly, and then went straight back to normal once they had asked me to stick my head between my knees and keep breathing deeply. Also, both of my ears had turned deep red/purple and they were VERY warm to the touch. They felt as if heat were tunneling out of them. The only way I can explain truly how I felt, and I have NEVER done it fully, I felt as if I was fainting. Out of nowhere I felt as if I was going to pass out ? but it didn?t happen. The entire ?spell? lasted about 20 mins? I was monitored for an additional 40 minutes and was allowed to leave.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Approximately 9 hours after vaccination, I had a temperature of 100.5F, a slight headache, and mild nausea.  Temperature reduced to normal within 10 hours of spiking.  Headache increased at this time and muscle pain and pain at lymph node sites began.  This report is being filed 24 hours after vaccination.

                                                The night of 3/9/21  following the vaccination I had fever, chills, sweating, severe body aches and pains (all over) and nightmares Wednesday morning I was unable to go to work and remained in bed sleeping all but approximately 2 hours in the afternoon  because I was still in pain and had headache/fever/chills/muscle and joint pain. I also had no appetite. I was awake long enough to eat one bowl of cereal and a small apple sauce cup so that I could take more meds without upsetting my stomach. Wednesday night 3/10 my temperature was still at 99.3. I was still having body soreness and headaches (sinus). Thursday morning 3/11 I still had the headache and body soreness but no more fever. I was still feeling unwell but could at least get out of bed and function. By late Thursday most of the symptoms subsided and I started feeling better. Friday morning I was no longer having symptoms.  It was the initial symptoms Tuesday night and Wednesday that concerned me the most because it hit me so severely and fast. The pharmacist warned me of possible side effects that would require over the counter medication, but in my case that did not suffice. I was physically unable to do anything but sleep which is highly unusual for me, and my entire body was in more pain than I?ve ever experienced.

                                                First I felt lightheaded/dizzy, then became nauseous, and my feet and hands were numb and tingling, I felt like my tongue was getting bigger but the primary care dr at the clinic didn&#39;t think so. They eventually after monitoring me for awhile sent me down to ER, by then my voice was raspy and scratchy, my lower lip was big, my tongue still felt big. I still felt nauseous. The dr asked me if my eyes are usually swollen and red and I said no. My extremities were still numb and tingling. I got epi and other drugs, zofran, benadryl, pepcid, I think a dose of steroids. The symptoms continued so I ended up getting a 2nd dose of epi. I went home around 5pm. When I woke up that evening to do a neb treatment I was nauseous, my lower lip again big, my tongue felt thick and this time my upper throat felt swollen, I gave myself epi and took myself to ER, they monitored me for 3 hrs the dr was gonna hospitalize me if I got worse, I still felt nauseous and the numbness and tingling feeling in my hands and feet when I left but was not having any airway issues when I left. Not sure if the numbness/tingly is gonna go away in my hands and feet.

On her vaccination list she stated that she is allergic to many thing including some foods and medication. She stated that her doctor still wants her to receive it due to her condition(immune system disorder). She came with her husband. They had a case with medications in case she experiences reaction. He had Benadryl and EpiPen in his case. First 15 minutes she was feeling fine, on the 25-30 min I asked them how was she doing and husband said she is not feeling very good. we measured her heart rate and it was around 150bpm.  Husband said her lips and tongue  are starting to swell. I asked him if they want me to call 911 but he refused. He preferred to take her home and observe. I called to check on patient few hours ago. He told me she was stable but her tongue is still swollen. I told them to go to ER if the symptoms get worse. He said she is improving and feeling better now

                                                At the time of my vaccine I was 30 weeks pregnant. My expected date of delivery is 5/18/21 and I have had no issues/complications with this pregnancy.   I received my vaccine on 3/9  at 4:00 PM, and stayed to be monitored for  30 minutes due to my pregnancy, After the vaccine, Per the clinics recommendation, I drank lots of fluids the rest of the day. Several hours later I noticed I had a minor headache. I Consulted with my OBGYN and took 650mg of Tylenol before going to bed. By midnight when I layed down(and throughout the remainder of the night - till about 7am) I had moderate body aches - especially in my legs. I also felt feverish with chills and at times sweating, but had no actual fever. I checked on three sperate occasions between 12AM and 7AM. I was unable to sleep that night.   The following day (3/10) I felt tired, had some lingering body aches (though not as bad as the night before) and a minor headache that would come and go throughout the day. I also had minor arm pain at the injection site - nothing different then a flu shot. continued to drink lots of fluids and took  Tyelnol as needed.   When I woke up on 3/11, I felt perfectly fine. No headache, body aches, arm pain, etc.

                                                I began to have a small headache about 4 hours after the shot which turned into a bigger full body aches, and tiredness 8 hours after injection. Chills started approximately 10 hrs after injection and lasted for at least 4 hours, followed by sweats which lasted at least another 6 hours. Aches were very painful for ten hours and I took extra strength tylenol twice over the ten hour period. Aches and exhaustion continued, though less painful, for the next  12-18 hours. and were gone after about 36 hours total.  Shoulder at injection site did not hurt initially, but began to hurt about 10 hrs after, and continued to get worse for about 10 hours until finally dissapating in that spot 48 hrs later.  However, the pain at the injection site has moved to the shoulder joint, and adjacent clavical area over the next day or so where it has stayed now 5 days after injection.

By 6:30pm, I was down for the count with the cold sweats, diarrhea, headache and vertigo like symptoms (dizzy when standing or moving). Tylenol was taken for fever and water and Gatorade is all that was drank for the remainder of the night. When awaking around 8am the next morning,  fever was gone as well as chills. headache and dizziness remained. Around 1pm, toast and oatmeal was eaten and started feeling more normal again. by 5pm was fine, just tired and sore still.

                                                I received the vaccine on Friday afternoon at 4 and woke up on Friday night being extremely nauseous followed by chills and sweats. Saturday I felt achy and a little unsteady when I got up or walked around (these reactions I expected). Sunday morning I woke up covered head to toe in hives that lasted for three days. I have never had hives so bad before. I called the pharmacy and was instructed to take Benedryl which didn&#39;t work. I took Allegra on Tuesday which seemed to help clear them up by the end of the day.

But then on Monday I noticed a very tender left armpit, and I also have very itchy eyes, something I never have.  I also developed a small purple patch on my leg, and a little skin sore on my left arm.  It looks like more may be developing.

                                                15 mins after vaccination I began to have a scratchy throat, which gradually got worse and became thick mucus in throat, wheezing, sinus inflammation, fatigue, racing heartbeat. Symptoms became under control after 50mg of Benadryl. Thick mucus lingered until the next day. Increased heart rate leveled off after Benadryl took affect. Fully recovered by the following day.

I drifted off to sleep all right around 10:30, but by midnight, my legs were on fire like I?d just run a marathon. I?m pretty sure I had a fever because I was sweating and tossing and turning for what seemed like hours. By 4:00, I had a massive headache and felt like I was going to throw up. I took Advil and Zofran at 4 and went back to bed. Sunday I still battled headache, aches, and fatigue. The fatigue is what&#39;s still lingering yesterday and today.

                                                I received the vaccine at approximately 4:35 PM. I got a headache around 9:30 PM and took Tylenol at that time. I started getting very cold and shaking around 10:00 PM. My finger nails and lips started getting pale and my temperature started rising. The shaking stopped around 12:15 AM, but my fever continued as high as 101.4 throughout the night and into the morning. I continued taking Tylenol and the fever went away the morning of 3/12/21, but slight chills returned around noon that did not last long. I took more Tylenol that evening for a headache and noticed I had an on and off throbbing pain in my right ear.

By the 25 minute mark, I noticed numbness in my cheeks, around my mouth and my forehead. I turned around and went back to the Health Department for observation. I sat with a nurse until I passed the hour mark for after the vaccine had been given. By that point, the numbness was gone around my mouth and forehead, but the numbness remained in my cheeks and they were visibly red where they were numb. At this point, I left the health department because my symptoms were getting better. It took about 2.5 hours for the numbness to gone in my cheeks.

I am on a steroid and to antihistamines to help prevent this from happening again along with Benadryl, ibuprofen for pain.

At approximately 12:45 pm I was called to vaccine tent #1 after reports from staff that a patient was feeling sick after receiving her Janssen injection. I discovered the patient slumped in her chair, head back with eyes closed, skin clammy and cool. Alert and oriented x3, speaking slowly but clearly. Per vaccine nurse, she administered the Janssen injection to patient at 12:41 pm  (Lot 1805020, exp 5/25/2021, Left Deltoid) and a few minutes later the patient started to close her eyes and leaned back in chair requiring assistance to sit up.  Nurse was able to stabilize patient in chair and then called for help and that is when I came to assist. Patient remained in this state for several more minutes. Activated EMS for further evaluation as patient did not stabilize immediately. Measured vital signs ? Blood Pressure 98/62, O2SAT 97, Pulse 68.  I continued to monitor the patient until EMS arrived. EMS evaluated patient and cleared but advised to continue to monitor for an additional 15 minutes before leaving the site. Patient verbalized understanding and agreed with plan. Patient remained in observation for an additional 15 minutes with no incident.

                                                I went to a community event (held at a church) for the COVID vaccine. After the vaccine, I wanted the 15 minutes and felt ok - just hot. I went out to my car and over the next few minutes - I was getting hotter - My face was extremely hot and flushed, and hives started developing on my arms and chest. They were burning and itching; my skin was hot to the touch. My chest felt tight and my throat felt swollen, but I was able to breathe (breathe felt a little short, but I was able to take a full breathe). I was also dizzy and felt nauseous. I went to the ER, where they treated me for anaphylaxis with Benadryl, Pepcid, Breathing treatment, and a steroid. After about an hour or so I felt fine, and the dr gave me some medications to take over the next few days.

My arm was immediately tingly and numb simultaneously, and I felt...light and weird. Around 2p, I began feeling feeling lightheaded and weak, and at 6p, I had chills, severe weakness, dizziness and nausea. I couldn&#39;t stand up longer than 2 minutes without wanting to vomit and faint. I couldn&#39;t even stand up long enough to wash dishes, prepare a bowl of grapes to eat or shower. Throughout the night, I sweated so terribly from the chills to the point that my bed was soaked to the mattress pad, and currently at 2:02p on April 6th, I&#39;m still experiencing the extreme weakness, nausea, and chills.

                                                Approximately 9 hours after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA, I experienced sudden fatigue followed by onset of severe muscle and joint pain including severe head pain followed by severe chills followed by fever and excessive sweating. I was very dizzy and felt disoriented. I was in bed when all this happened and was already wearing warm clothes under the covers. The muscle and joint pain was so severe, I couldn&#39;t grip anything including my cell phone (my wrists were in sharp pain). The head pain was so severe I was sensitive to light regardless of how dim it was. I felt like my toes were curled, but that could have been me &#34;bracing&#34; and tightening up due to the total body pain. I could move very little. It was very strange. These symptoms persisted through the night. The following morning at around 9am, I still had a very bad headache that made me nauseated and continued to be sensitive to light. Some of the joint and muscle pain tapered down enough for me to get out of bed to go potty but it was exhausting to walk 5 feet to the bathroom and then get back in bed. I still ran a mild fever. At around 1pm I took a Tylenol that helped subside the symptoms but felt wiped out all day. By the following day (Monday), I was feeling better getting more energy and by that Monday evening, I felt like nothing ever happened. I&#39;m sure these just fall into perhaps the more severe level of the side effects, but I was frightened by the intense sharp muscle and joint pain to the point I couldn&#39;t even grip anything.

I also got dizzy and lightheaded. The girl in the car next to me had waved over one of the attendants as well because she was feeling weird too. I got home and had the worst headache I&#39;ve ever had and felt flu like symptoms and very weak. The next day at work I was so sick I had to go home. I was puking and had diarrhea  over and over for a few hours. I also felt lightheaded and dizzy and weak. Also had the headache. I was getting chills as well once I got home. Today I just feel very weak and just &#34;off&#34;.

About 10 minutes after the shot, she came back to the pharmacy and reported she was not feeling right.  She was extremely tired, weak, and dizzy.  She was told to sit down for further observation and given a bottle of water.  About 5 minutes later, she said she was still feeling really bad.  She said she was not thinking clearly and didn&#39;t feel right. She was also experiencing moderate pain down her spine.  She said her thinking was so affected that she wanted to seek treatment.   Patient declined offer to call EMS, and proceeded to an urgent care clinic next door.  Urgent care later called the pharmacy to inform us that patient had been transported to the hospital by ambulance.

It felt like I just ran a marathon. My breathing increased and I felt very dizzy and lightheaded. I stayed in the store and walked around hoping symptoms wouldn&#39;t get worse for 25 minutes then left. I had my three small children with me and wanted to get them home. I called my husband who is a physician and told him everything I was experiencing. He told me to stay in the store to see how things went. I then drove home to monitor my symptoms. I had post nasal drip and it exacerbated over the next few weeks. I was on two different antibiotics because it felt like I had a bad ear infection. It never went away. I saw an ENT and my tympanaplasty that I had as a child blew. I have a large hole in my ear drum currently and very dizzy. I am getting a CT of my ear this Wednesday and I will have to have surgery in the next few months for another tympanoplasty.

Because it would make me more nauseated.  Terrible headache I fell asleep earlier in the afternoon I had to hold my Stomach and even turning in bed led to more nausea.  Finally fell asleep  dor the night woke up so far today I don?t feel nauseated I do feel dehydrated and I tried to drink Gatorade but drinking  from a cup aggravates it so only like ice chips or popsicles don?t aggravate my stomach    I felt like I was dying just laying on the floor for hours I laid on the. Ahg room floor because the tile was cool and I was near the toilet.  I tested positive for covid asymptomatic in October and then positive again in December with mild symptoms.  I never fully regained sense of smell or taste only partially even though that was months ago.  I wouldn?t wish that vaccine reaction in anyone   I was hesitant sins with already had covid to get vaccinated but was encouraged to do so.  I definitely won?t do that again ever.  It wasn?t that bad actually having COVID that was way worse.

Experienced some stinging at injection site within a few seconds that became uncomfortable for several minutes then disappeared.  At 2:40 texted spouse that my face was tingling.  Started in cheeks and upper lip and spread to nose. A few minutes after that I started having hot flashes and my face was flushed.  Hot flashes lasted for an hour and subsided, tingling has mostly subsided except for area of cheek closest to my nose (it is 6 pm now).  Did not formally check into the urgent care facility but did contact them to see if this was normal.  Was advised to take antihistamine and, and if symptoms worsened to go to ER.  Symptoms did not get worse.

Chills, fever which reached 104 by midnight, racing heartbeat which lead to increased palpitations, slight dizziness, body aches all over.  I was unable to fall asleep until 2:30am.   The following day, chills and fever continued, though lower at ~99.4-100.6, along with aches, fogginess and loss of appetite.

The symptoms subsided about an hour later. Around 11pm, I started to have wheezing, chest tightness, and back pain. I have been using my inhaler and nebulizer since last night for the wheezing. I spoke to a doctor through phone who confirmed these aren&#39;t normal side effects from the vaccine.

I had chills and my teeth were actually chattering at one point it was so bad. This gradually got worse as the evening went on. With it I also started feeling weak and fatigued. By 8pm I started to have a headache. Throughout the night symptoms worsened and I had a fever and more serious headache. My head was pounding so badly. I couldn&#39;t sleep at all. I also had a couple hot flashes to where I woke up sweating. Then I would feel frozen again. The nausea started during the night too. I thought I would throw up but didn&#39;t. At one point my heart was racing so fast I was a little concerned something bad would happen to me and contemplated going to the hospital. By morning I felt a little better, still nauseous and with a bad headache. My body was a little weak. These symptoms lasted all day Thursday. By that Friday morning I only had a little weakness and slight headache. By mid day Friday I was pretty much back to normal.

                                                I had redness that started small then spread throughout the arm. The diameter of the redness at its worse was about 4 inches. I also had itching, swelling, I have a hard lump on the injection site, the area of the lump is very tender, and the area is warm to touch. I called the advice nurse line and was told it was covid arm. It was treated with warm compresses, Tylenol for pain, antihistamines, and Triderm cream for the itchiness.  Now most symptoms have resolved, except for the hard lump on the injection site and mild tenderness.

                                                On the day of getting the shot it burned badly. About an hour later a knot formed at the injection site and my skinned turned red. On March 12, my arm was still red, feverish and the knot was still present. I went to the doctor on March 15 where he examined the knot. It was still feverish sore to touch and starting to turn the color similar to a bruise. He put me on an antibiotic because it seemed infected. I finished the antibiotic and as of today March 30, the knot is still present. It doesn&#39;t hurt to touch it anymore but I still have a hard mass a little bigger than a quarter at the injection site and the bruising color is still present. I go for an ultra sound of the knot on tomorrow, March 31.

                                                Shortly after the vaccine on the drive home the injection site got super hot, the arm began to swell and turn red.  I developed a fever and my sinuses got really stuffy.  I began to throw up profusely which made all symptoms from other issues occur causing me to swell all over and because I couldnt take any meds or keep anything down I went to the ER.   While there I began wheezing and experiencing SOB which still is an issue today.  I have foggy moments where my brain seems so foggy that I am having issues with my short term memory.  I was administered IV fluids, IV morphine and IV ibuphropen to help with the symptoms and was hospitalized for less than a day further evaluation

As I walked to the restroom to vomit I lost 100% of my vision, I became very disoriented and had the loudest screeching in both ears. I screamed for my husband and I caught me as I was taken to the floor with no mobility. The episode last several minutes before he was able to move me back to bed. I had severe sweating and ear ringing. As I report this I still have a lingering brain fog and ear ringing.  I reported it to my physician and told to go to the ER if any reoccurrence of reaction.

                                                I have a history of anaphylaxis, and disclosed that to the medics so they watched me more carefully, which was good, as while I did not experience anything that severe, I did immediately get itchy, turn red and feel quite nauseated. However,  after they monitored me awhile, I told them I felt okay to go home. The next day I had the expected mild flu-like symptoms, which I anticipated. However, what?s been atypical is they returned tenfold three days later. This time with a much higher fever (103), severe chills, fatigue, a seemingly never-ending headache,  muscle spasms,  chest palpitations and suddenly I am experiencing asthma (which is typically seasonal) and am coughing, too.  I?m now a week past when I was vaccinated and each day was feel worse, not better. I have had to cancel my clients and hire a sitter to care for my kids as I am too weak and ill to do it.  I looked up common reactions and nothing states chest pain and/or asthma, nor that it should last this long. That said, as I am high-risk, I work from home and homeschool both of my young kids. Thus, I have been nowhere aside from the vaccine site. Moreover, my partner, our kids and sitter get routinely tested for me,  and everyone is negative. Thus, it appears I am having prolonged, heightened side-effects much more intense than the ?mild? flu-like symptoms otherwise reported, which is concerning. I took no medication prior to receiving the vaccine, either.

                                                Immediate injection site pain including stinging and burning.  Site continued to sting for over an hour post injection.  Burning feeling at injection site continued for several hours.  Brain fog and chills set in within 2 hours post injection.  Fatigue, headache, and joint stiffness and pain started about 4 hours post injection.  Injection was given on left arm; left hand became painful about 4 hours post injection, as though someone had put it in a vice.  Joint pain worsened.  Upon laying down to sleep, I became so cold I could not get warm even with an electric blanket on high.  Started to feel stabbing pains in my jaw, back of my neck and down behind my shoulder blade on my left side.  Headache worsened and started to feel pressure in my ears.  Joints, my knees in particular, felt like they were made of gravel and someone was stabbing them with a hot poker.  Did not sleep due to pain.  Has been 20 hours post vaccine, injection site is still very painful and swollen.  Joint pain, headache, fatigue and chills continue.  Was unable to go to work today.

I elevated over the next 24 hours frequently an swelling went away.  2 - On Friday, March 26, swollen glands under my left armpit (shot received in left arm), swelling is completely gone as of 3/29.  3 - the evening of 3/28/21 I became itchy on my scalp, arms and back.  I have showered and applied lotion and have not introduced anything new to my routine which is why I believe it may be shot related and worth mentioning.  The intensity is mild but if it persists or worsens I will contact my doctor.

I shivered and sweated for 12 hours overnight with a severe headache. I tossed most of the night and had to get up to pee 3 times throughout the night - which is extremely uncommon. By 24 hours after the injection, I still had a strong headache and was mostly able to regulate my body temp. By 36 hours after, I felt tired but no longer had a headache or chills. My injection site is red, raised and very tender.

The patient stated that immediately after receiving the vaccination, she felt a shooting pain in the injection site. The patient stated that within a few minutes, she felt lightheaded and nauseous. The patient then stated that within 20 minutes, she felt like she was having an asthma attack and had to use her rescue inhaler (albuterol HFA). It was reported that the patient left the pharmacy about 45 minutes after receiving the vaccination and the patient stated she was feeling better. The patient the reported to the pharmacy that the morning of April 7, 2021 that her symptoms of shortness of breath and wheezing returned and she went to an emergency room for treatment. The patient stated that after admission into the ER, the medical staff performed two EKGs and one chest X-ray, which were unremarkable. The patient stated she received treatment with Duoneb because she was wheezing and and treatment with IV methylprednisolone because her throat and tongue appeared swollen. The patient stated she was discharged on April 7, 2021 and was prescribed albuterol solution for nebulization and prednisone 10 mg tablets.

This morning now my joints no longer hurt, but I still have the headache.
