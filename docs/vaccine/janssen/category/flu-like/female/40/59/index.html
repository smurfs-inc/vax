                                                Dizzy, run down two hours after injection. Woke up 4 am then off and on with extreme body pain, sore neck , lower back, right hand and arm. Headache and fatigue at 6:45 am got up with two children (2 yrs and 10 months) ate small breakfast by 9 am I couldn?t get off the couch or stay awake. My head started aching and my eyes hurt, I felt extreme chills two thick blankets weren?t enough to warm me. Extreme fatigue, stomach pain and loss of appetite. I fell asleep and didnt have the energy to walk to my bed until 2:30 pm.  It set off my stomach and I was vomiting off and on until around 9 pm. By then I could keep little bits of fluid and food down. Then I was hot. I felt flushed but had no fever. My usual heart rate is 52-54 bpm via Watch while laying down. My heart rate during this hot period laying in bed was 102 -101 bpm. Which is consistent for my workout heart rate. I went to sleep and woke up 7 am with my kids and was well enough to take care of them but not do all my usual chores. I couldn?t bend down or put my head lower than chest or the extreme throbbing headache was back. Still had body aches and fatigue but nowhere near yesterday. It is 11:22 pm Sunday and I feel spent.

                                                I spiked a fever of 101, had joint pain in all joints except fingers and toes, my muscles ached and spasmed a bit and a had an incredibly bad headache.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA About 6 hours after receiving vaccine, sudden onset of fever to 101 degrees with chills.  About two hours after the fever began, extreme fatigue and muscle and joint pain, and left breast pain began (had the injection in my left arm).  The extreme fatigue lasted for about 9 hours, during which time I felt like I could barely walk or move in bed.  After the extreme fatigue passed, and for about 24 hours, I continued to experience moderate fatigue, joint and muscle pain, and headaches.  A bad headache has bothered me for about 36 hours since the extreme fatigue passed.  All symptoms are now clearing up (it is now about 42 hours post vaccination).

She had been waiting less than 10 minutes.  I went to her and she said she was feeling very strange and was nauseous. I tried to get her up but she couldn&#39;t walk so I let her sit back down. She was not able to communicate with me but was conscious. She said her vision was distorted. her lips started to turn blue and I continued to monitor her. I called 911 and she said she was having difficulty catching her breath so I went for the epipen and gave her 0.3 mg in the outer thigh of her right leg. her color started to improve and she was able to comunicate better. I followed EMS instructions and continued to monitor her until they arrived.

                                                A few seconds after vaccine was given I had a sensation go up my left jawline that felt similar to a nerve pain.  I didn&#39;t think much of it and waited the 10 minutes after my vaccine and had no other symptoms.  I left the pharmacy and started driving home and had a sudden sensation of a heaviness in my chest and trouble taking a deep breath.  I also felt like my tongue and throat were swelling slightly.  I had a warm sensation throughout the middle of my back that felt like a heating pad was on it.  I felt light-headed and called my husband.  As I continued to drive my symptoms worsened and I called 911.  I made it home in my car and the ambulance met me there.  My husband called the pharmacy to ask them what we should do and they said that it would be ok for him to give me Benadryl.  I took 15mL of liquid Benadryl shortly before the ambulance arrived.   Within 15-20 minutes, I felt like I was able to swallow better.  In the ER, I received IV Benadryl and Famotidine.  I was also given 800mg of Ibuprofen for a bad headache I developed.  My oxygen level remained in the high 90&#39;s and my symptoms were much improved after the IV medication.  I was instructed to continue taking Benadryl capsules for the next few days along with Pepcid to keep my symptoms from flaring back up.  I noticed this morning when waking up that the left side of my face as well as my throat felt odd so I took the Pepcid and Benadryl and symptoms were relieved in 30 mins or so.

                                                5:00 pm 3-9-21  I became instantly exhausted and had fatigue.  I got chills and ran a 99.8 fever.  I went to bed and about 5 hours later my fever broke and I felt fine in the morning when I woke up.  9:30pm  on 3-13-21 I found both of my thighs bright red.  It was not itchy, but it was warm to the touch.  7:45pm on 3-14-21  My butt cheeks were bright red and warm to the touch.  Then about 30 minutes later my thighs became red.  Everything red started itching was raised like hives.  I found three dots on my arm and later those spread into large spots of hives.  Then over the next 9 hours, a new spot would start, it would spread, then it would itch like crazy.  I took 25mg of Diphenhydramine at 8pm.  I took another 50mg at 10 when I was having no relief and it continued to spread.  At 1:15am both of my hands and wrists had hives and these hurt and itched the most because they were swollen and hard to bend.  At 3am both of my feet started to flair up.  Finally around 5am the hives stopped.  I was not able to sleep through it.  I did not ever have a fever, I checked that 4 times.  I also did not have trouble breathing or have any swelling on my face. 3-15-21 @ 9:20am I went to see my doctor.  All of my vitals were good.  All of my hives were gone.  He put me on Prednisone in case it came back and at 11am I took 4 pills and went to bed.  I woke up 2 hours later and my feet were itching again.  My left foot broke out in hives bad.   It lasted for over an hour.  My toes were hard to bend.   4:34pm on 3-15-21 currently I don&#39;t have any hives and I am tired.    I thoroughly thought through everything that I have eaten, worn, and used, and I have changed nothing over the past 2 weeks.

The chills subsided after about 2 hours, but then my resting heart rate went up to 110-120 bpm rather than the normal 75-85 for me. It felt like my heart was beating out of my chest even though I was laying down in bed. That lasted through the night and I felt back to normal around mid-morning.

                                                Head ache and fever started the evening of March. Severe vertigo and nausea began sometime overnight or early the next morning. I was bed-ridden most of the day. I took zofran and ibuprofen. From then on the severe vertigo happened only while changing positions such as laying down and getting up. I saw a nurse practitioner on March 16th who told me it was due to ear wax. I received a prescription (meclizine) for the nausea and dizziness and bought an ear wax kit. The next a friend said her husband had the exact same symptoms as I was experiencing and that it was called facility. My husband assisted me with the epley maneuver twice on March 17th. By March 18th the vertigo was gone, with just slight dizziness during the day.

The day after the shot, on Tuesday 3/23 at 7:30am, about 30 minutes after waking up, I felt nausea for a brief instant and immediately the need to vomit; I then had one episode of throwing up, pretty intense. After that I felt weak and cancelled my fitness class I was going to teach in the afternoon. I spent the rest of the day resting and taking care of myself because I felt exhausted.

After no side effects, I drove away.  Only to have a sudden reaction as I was driving.  I&#39;ve felt dizzy with flu vaccines before and have felt the same symptoms as with the covid vaccine when IV dye was injected for a CT scan 5 months ago.  Felt faint/ dizzy, Got severe tachycardia, thought my heart was gonna explode.  I drove back in a hurry, scared and confused. I was waiting to be seen, and no one ever came out.  Symptoms subsided on their own after 15 min, therefore I just left without notifying anyone.  2 hours after vaccine, my arm looked moderately red and swollen, with minimal pain.  7 hours after getting the vaccine I started with chills and body aches.  8 hours after getting the vaccine I felt feverish and malaise.  After taking Tylenol with feverish symptoms (didn&#39;t check temp) slept for 2 hours and felt a little better.

                                                I felt light headedness right away. The night that I got the injection, I felt kind of drunk. I felt like I had too much alcohol. I am very sensitive to things. I felt silly - loose - tired.  In the night, I had aches and chills - no fever. The next day I felt achy and really really tired. I had a pain at the injection site. That evolved into a left side migraine (the achiness and fatigue and pain from shot) It created tension up my arm and up my neck - and I did get nausea with the headache - on Saturday. Sunday, I felt a little bit better but energy was still low - unusual tiredness; couldn&#39;t exercise as I felt a heavy fatigue. On Sunday, I went to a dance class but it was difficult as I was tired. On Monday, I felt a tiny bit better but still fatigued and did another dance class which went a little better. On Monday evening, I felt like I did the night of the injection - a little loopy and &#34;drunk like.&#34; Monday night, I woke up with a Fiery, achy, itchy, burning rash on both of my arms and the tops of my legs. If I would itch it, it would exaggerate it. When I woke up the next day - the rash went everywhere in my body - it would come and go in different places - neck, face, down and up my legs and feet and on my butt. Pretty much every spot had the rash at one time or another. It was really bad on Tuesday morning, I called the doctor. Was treated with Benadryl and cortisone cream which helped with the symptoms. Tuesday night, it was excruciating - it was all up and down my legs, arms, neck and face and stomach and rear end and feet. It was very achy, burning and itchy - very intense. It would hurt if I scratched it. Accompanied with really intense fatigue. Wednesday, after taking Benadryl, I woke up and it was a tiny bit better. It was still on my legs, neck and face. Sometimes my arms would flare up and sometimes they wouldn&#39;t. Any kind of exertion - like my dance class - would trigger the rash - so I took a break from exercising that week.  It started getting incrementally better - very slowly. Still there on Thursday - still fatigued and I was still taking Benadryl. Friday, also. Saturday, it was pretty much gone but it would threaten to come back and I felt itchiness in my legs when I went for a walk. It still feels a little lingering - my legs are itchy. I&#39;m still building back my energy. Incrementally my energy is increasing. Still not 100% there but it&#39;s getting better day by day.  Note: My history with my skin: I do get flare ups when I get bug bites and when I get poison ivy - I have very sensitive skin.

                                                In addition to the known side effects of extreme fatigue, low grade fever and body aches, I also have right arm pain at the site of injection with right arm swelling, warmth and right axilla swelling and tenderness.  The arm pain was began immediately at the time of injection and did initially lessen some for the first 12 hours until it started worsening mid-morning 22-24 hours after the injection.  Around 26 hours after the injection the arm pain worsened such that it couldn&#39;t be ignored and the axilla pain became very prominent almost worse than the arm pain.  Upon inspection I noticed obvious swelling and pain in my right axilla.  The right arm and axilla pain has persisted and worsened over the last 2 days to now include upper biceps, upper triceps, lower deltoid, trapezius, clavicular and right lateral breast pain.  The axilla and arm swelling has persisted and worsened over the last two days to now include swelling in my upper arm, around my clavicle, my upper chest and upper back.  The initial axilla swelling has not decreased any and is more prominent than any of the swelling located elsewhere.  Of note, I cannot easily palpate any axilla, clavicular or cervical lymph nodes.  If there is lymp involvement the nodes are not appearing to be extremely swollen with palpation exam.

Administered Toradol and IV fluids, discharged me with good vitals, but still tachycardia, headache, and vomiting. The next day (3/20), I still had a bad headache and could  not keep liquids down. I vomited perhaps 12 times, then called the doctor. She sent me to Urgent Care to receive injections of Toradol and Phenergan. Within the hour, I  could drink. Then shortly after, I  could eat. I  felt better for one day. The next day (3/22), my heart started pounding, and I was unable to sleep horizontally. I  needed to sleep on 3 pillows due to chest discomfort. My chest still feels very uncomfortable. Abdominal breathing is helping to an extent. I have had to stay in bed and greatly reduce my activities since receiving the vaccine.  Today is one week, and I am still in bed.

Approximately, 5 minutes after vaccinating the patient, patient came up to the counter stating that she is dizzy and feel to the floor. We quickly went to check on the patient and patient stated she is feeling very dizzy. When asked if she can breath, she stated she is fine and the only thing is dizziness, which happened before. Patient was extremely weak and pharmacy staff helped her into the immunization room to sit and lay her head down. We got her some juice and chips, which helped the patient. Patient was resting for about 20 minutes in the immunization with another pharmacy staff. Patient was advised to report any other symptoms that may require us to call the ambulance. After about 20 minutes, pt came out of the room and sat for about 10-15 more minutes again. When asked the patient how she is feeling again, she said she is feeling normal again and that it had only happened to her once. Patient left the pharmacy in good condition.

Around 12:30 am (March 30th) (about 6 hours after receiving the Johnson and Johnson COVID) vaccine I woke up with chills, body aches all over and a headache. That along with fatigue continued for about 28 hours. I missed a day of work due to not feeling well. The following day (March 31st) I still felt tired and spacey. My headache was better. But I started having hot flashes and more minor body aches. Not as severe body aches as the previous day. April 1st I felt back to normal. I called my doctor&#39;s nurse on March 30th to ask if I could take Tylenol to help with my bad headache. She advised not to so I didn&#39;t take any Tylenol or Ibprophen.

By 9:00pm the body aches were worse and onset of chills.  By 10pm, I was shaking uncontrollable from chills and had a 102.5 fever all night.  It wasn&#39;t until about 12:30pm the next day for the fever to break.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Developed a headache and sore arm approximately 12 hours after vaccine administered. The headache lasted for 5 days.  I currently still have a walnut-sized, firm lump in my arm at the injection site that is still slightly painful (like a mild bruise). The skin surface of the injection site was itchy (like a mosquito bite) on 3/22 and 3/23. My main concern is the continued presence of the lump in my arm.

I tried taking a warm bath, but it felt cold. Once I bundled up and got into bed, the chills wore off and transitioned almost immediately to a fever spike, which reached 103.8 at its peak at around 9-9:30p. The fever stayed at that level for about 4-5 hrs, before it started to subside, at around 3a. By 10a on April 4, my fever was down to 99.5 or so, with a headache. Today, April 2, I have no fever and only a mild headache.

                                                Around 6 hours after vaccine, I had uncontrollable chills. This led to a low grade fever. I tried to sleep it off, but woke up with my heart racing- My resting BPM was around 120. My skin was super sensitive. I started taking 2 extra strength Tylenol every 6 hours around 5pm, and that helped a little. I couldn&#39;t focus on anything- I could basically stare at the wall while my heart was hammering. I finally slept, and woke up soaked in sweat with my fever broken (my fever never got above 99) around 2am, and improved steadily after that.

Had an EKG, temperature check and was given Tylenol.  Headache pain increased but heart rate started to come down enough to be discharged, heart rate was down to around 80 bmp.

                                                pt was fine until 15 minutes into her waiting time at which she stated she felt faint and light headed.  Continued to worsen based on dialogue with patient.  Tried to take blood pressure manually as well as with automated cuff but too low to detect.  Pt stated she felt tingly all over, hot , clammy, dizzy and was made worse by opening her eyes.  Put ice packs on neck and forehead as well as wet cloth.  Pt requested water but we declined as to not knowing severity or extent of reaction yet.  Based upon pt not improving and lack of palpable pulse decision to involve EMS was made.  Upon ems arrival 10 min later pt was taken to their transport vehicle for further evaluation.   At that time they observed vitals to be normal, monitored for additional 10-15 minutes and determined pt had adverse reaction, not allergic reaction.  Pts caregiver called us to let us know she was fine on drive home and improved rapidly en route.  Noted pt drove 2-3 hours for appointment, in convertible with temps in mid -upper 70&#39;s and noted she was possibly hot upon arrival and this could have precipitated reaction to injection.

My body was feeling heavier. I tried to sleep again and was waking up every 1 hour. In the morning, I was feeling like a truck went over me: headache, feeling tired and body pain. I was monitoring the  fever and it went away at around 6am. But I was feeling very tired the entire day and headache stopped at around 3pm. in the night, symptoms were mild. Next day (today) I&#39;m feeling better than yesterday (back to work), but not 100% - would say 80%.

                                                My vaccine was administered at 12:30pm. I waited until 12:55 at CVS after the vaccine to make sure there were no reactions. I also move my arm around a lot after the injection to keep it from hurting. I drove home, at lunch and about 2:45 was hit with a very noticeable headache. I never get headaches and eat healthy and consume about a gallon of water a day. I knew it wasn&#39;t from dehydration or being hungry.  Headache was in the temple area and made my eyes hurt in the same way they would if you had cried for an extended period of time or were overtired. At 3pm a wave of exhaustion hit me. I was sitting working trying to combat the headache and felt almost wiped out. I got through the rest of my work day (4:30) and went to lay down immediately. I passed out almost instantly until 7 pm. I work up and showered, ate dinner and started to feel a little warm. It should be noted it was an unseasonably warm day and got up to 77, so it was a tiny bit warm in my home. I put on loose fitting clothes and slayed on the couch still with the bad headache and the injection site started to throb so I placed and ice pack on for 20 minutes. I could only stay awake until 8:45 and got in bed. I could not get comfortable for several hours feeling very warm. I tried a fan on high and drinking more water but i felt very warm like how you feel with the flu. I took my temp at 1130pm it was normal. I continued to toss and turn and feel very warm and slightly dizzy, in the sense that I hadn&#39;t been able to sleep and with the headache my body was just exhausted. Around 2 am i woke up for more water and got in the shower because I had sweated so much my sheets were wet and my clothes. I got out of the shower around 10 minutes later, changed and got new sheets and got back in bad. Around 330 I felt very hot again and opened the windows and got another ice pack for my arm which was throbbing again. I finally fell asleep after 3:45am. I got up for work at 6am. I felt slightly foggy, and very hot. But no fever. My temp is normally around 97.4-97.9 and it was 98.4. Still normal but I was running warmer than usual. It took a long time to get ready and despite hot water in the shower I was freezing. i got dress and debated going to work. Got in the car at 6:45 and my drive to work is 30 minutes. 1/2 way into my drive I got very sweaty again and went home to change my clothes because they were too warm. Got to work around 7:20 and still felt warm but they take our temps at the door and min was still okay, no fever. I drank a lot of water and ate, and at 8:30 am all of a sudden the exhaustion was gone and I felt normal. I got home form work at 5:30p and took a 3 hour nap and felt normal again.

I asked the nurse when I went in to get the vaccine if I could get the vaccine if I have already had covid, she said that I could still have the vaccine. The nurse proceeded to vaccine. My boss then told me that she was wrong and that I should not have been given the vaccine if I have already had covid. Is the nurse wrong?

                                                I noticed it felt like a sinus cold coming on along with face, head and minor toothaches to the my left side of my face on the the 8th or 9th. I took Tylenol everyday for my sore arm and the headaches but it did help suppress them so I didn?t think much of it. My throat also started to feel kind of raw or itchy but I didn?t have a cough and I noticed a slight post nasal drip. Ok the 10th in the evening I felt exhausted and my face and sinuses were much worse. I took cold medicine and fell asleep early but had a hard time sleeping. I?m a side sleeper and if I turned on my left side, my ear felt like it was burning and my face would go numb. It also made me very dizzy. I woke up with body aches and light headed. My throat doesn?t hurt but it feels different. Almost numb like nothing and I can?t smell or taste.

                                                She got the vaccine she was fine, had a mild cramping in her stomach.  She wakes up at 5:00 AM in the morning for work and on Friday she could not put her feet on the ground for pain in her legs.  She also had a bad headache on the left side and took Advil for that, and then the headache switched to the right side.  She then took another Advil, and that was all she took that day and was that way the whole weekend.  She had pain all weekend and could not touch herself as the pain was so bad.  She also had chills, nauseated, her vision was going in and out as if she was at the eye doctors office.  Her uncle brought her mother over to her as she could not take care of herself or drive to take care of her cousin who she takes care of.  She went to go work on Monday 3/26/21  then she started having difficulty breathing  and her employer called the EMT&#39;s, they checked her heart rate which was high and did her oxygen level which was fine, and were afraid she may have gone into cardiac arrest, and told her to rest.  She called her doctor who told her that it was a bad reaction to the vaccine.   She is still having difficulty breathing after walking so far, she weighs 115# and has always been a small person.  She was not given any medications by her doctor and told her to rest and if it worsened to call her back.    She had been seen two weeks prior by her doctor for a sinus infection and was given an allergy shot and some other injection of which she does not know what it was, possibly a steroid.

With history of panic attacks we observed closely.  After 25 minutes, and symptoms getting worse, we decided it was best to administer epi-pen and called 911.  Symptoms got a bit better after a minute. After about 7 minutes another epi-pen was administered as symptoms were starting to get worse again.

I immediately got to her, felt her pulse and she was breathing so I lifted her legs. She immediately came to. We gave her ice packs and sat with her until she was able to move on her own accord. She was light headed and nauseated and had a friend take her home.

                                                Started with chills shortly after getting the injection, which got progressively worse. At 9:30 pm, the evening of injection, chills got worse, along with a headache and muscle aches that started with my shoulders and moved quickly down my body, eventually, ending at my toes. It hurt to move, even my fingers. I took 2 regular strength Tylenol, which helped get me to sleep. I then woke up around 4 am in a puddle of sweat... I took my temp and no fever, but body aches, headache and chills were still prevalent. I spent the next day in bed without moving or eating much - drank a lot of water. Tylenol every six hours. An hour after taking Tylenol, I seemed to be well enough to not be moaning and groaning, but it wore off too quickly and I had two hours of feeling horrible before taking more Tylenol for a bit of relief. I woke Sunday morning around 5 am in another puddle of sweat and severe body aches and headache. I took more Tylenol, went back to sleep and woke around 9 am feeling groggy, but quickly realized that I was feeling 100% better! Just like that. I also had pain at the injection site that for some reason seems to be getting worse today, Sunday (April 4). I do not have swelling or redness. It just feels hot and very very sore and getting worse. Heavy and hard to lift.

I felt super tired but my body would not let me sleep. I also had muscle aches and cramps with lower back and leg with a throbbing sensation. This was within 12 hours. About 5 days later, my eye started to hurt, went to se my eye doctor and they found out I have ocular herpes. I am on now on some antiviral eye medication. I could tell after the vaccine I had a viral type infection. I still have not recovered and I will see my eye doctor tomorrow.

                                                On 4-8-21 at approx 2:30am I woke up with chills, nausea and severe diarrhea. I began experiencing severe abdominal pain in belly button as if it were on fire. Hurt to take deep breaths. Developed hives all over body and very itchy. Scheduled phone call with triage nurse at 11:15am and then a follow up call again with my primary care doctor immediately following. At approx 1:22pm my primary care doctor told me to go to urgent care or ER due to concern of me going into anaphylactic shock. Immediately went to Emergency Room and admitted after waiting in waiting room for over 5 hrs. After bloodwork and CT Scan of abdomen my appendix was perforated and needed to be removed immediately. Immediately sent to OR for surgery at 11pm.

                                                Patient was given the Janssen vaccine and within 3 minutes the pt complained that she was lightheaded and dizzy. As I walked out of the pharmacy to see what her reaction was her muscles tensed up and she became completely rigid and stared sliding out of her chair. By appearances it looked like she was shaving a mild seizure, with a blank stare. By the time I got her down on the floor and got her coat off to see if there was an allergic reaction to the site the patient came too and asked me why she was in the floor. At that time she was clamy but knew who she was and where she was. Paramedics were called and while they were here she stated that she was dizzy and nauseous so they ended up taking her to a location hospital to be seen. While there they drew blood as a precaution.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine, I felt pretty good. Just some soreness in arm and a minor headache an hour later. I took Tylenol and symptoms were bearable the rest of the day. By around 6 or 7p that night, I experienced full body pain and chills, similar to the flu. I also had some chest pain and tightness but attributed that to the overall body pain. I was also very winded and short of breath. I called my Primary Care Doctor to report this, and she said this was a normal reaction and it meant my immune system was working. It continued into the next day, and I took my temperature and had a 102 fever. I slept most of the day and was unable to work. I also had a severe headache. The next day, on Day 3, my flu symptoms were getting better; however, I felt dizzy and short of breath. I also fainted . This is the first time this has ever happened to me. I have never fainted in my life. My symptoms seemed to resolve after eating and drinking, so I figured it may have been dehydration. On Day 4, I was concerned because I was having shortness of breath and chest pain, along with dizziness. I could not take a deep breath without having pain. I called my Primary Care Doctor, and she told me she was concerned I might have covid and to go to the ER. I do not believe I have covid. No one in my household has these symptoms except for me. I believe it is from this vaccine. My chest pain/shortness of breath seemed to go away. for a bit so I did not go to ER. I&#39;m on Day 5 now, and the chest pain/shortness of breath has come back, so I decided  to report this because I do not listed on the list of common side effects for the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I joined a J&amp;J social media group where others are also reporting these symptoms, so I decided to report to Vaers. I also have had night sweats every day since taking the vaccine and my blood pressure is lower since taking the vaccine.

                                                Started pretty immediately with feeling overheated like a wave of heat then started feeling unwell or not right then my right hand went numb that was about five minutes after the shot. Told the nurses they took me back in a room took my vitals at that time I started to feel weak like my arms and legs were Jell-O or jelly. I also felt jittery the nurses gave me apple juice and crackers they put me in a private room they check my vitals again my heart rate was elevated and my blood pressure also went up . 02 That?s normalsats normal My feet are they just started to feel numb as well. A doctor came in and checked me out they felt like my exam was normal but they also felt like I might be having a mild reaction around 1500 I started to get itchy but no hives noted I took a Benadryl 25 mg at 1500 around 1515 my feet were still numb but I definitely felt better still kind of felt like my arms and legs were weak but not as bad so after an hour and a half I was allowed to leave and was told to rest for the rest The day and you call or go to the emergency room if I had trouble some side-effects about four hours after the shot  my lips did start tingling at home I did check my oxygen saturations and it was normal I look at my lips to make sure that they weren?t swelling the only thing I noticed was that a scar I have on my lip that usually you can?t see was more prominent and you could actually see it my lower back hurts a lot

In the morning about 4 AM I could not sleep I achedall over and just felt generally unwell. I did run a low-grade fever and I could not work because of it.I was a bit foggy lightheaded dizzy at some points. It might be worth noting that I am a redhead and overall we are very sensitive.

Felt as if I were floating to chair. Sat for 20mins, legs weak, odd sensation across shoulder blades &amp; cervical spine. &#34;Slow&#34; &amp; woozy for duration of evening. Physically moved slow, cognitively slowed down, inability to focus. Internal body-wide sensation difficult to define. All very similar to immediate effects I have from alcohol. Passed out (sleep) 9hrs later &amp; woke 100% fine at 8am.

Patient was unable to swallow fever reducers due to fever and body trembling. Physician ordered Tylenol suppositories and Benadryl 50mg for suspected allergic reaction. Suppositories brought fever down to 103 and stopped trembling so patient was able to take Benadryl 50mg orally. Fever continued but was controlled with Tylenol.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Approx 7 p.m.,  I noticed moderate pain in my lower back, hips, and legs. Around 7 30, I felt very cold and began covering up with several blankets and turning up the heat. Husband and kids reported the house was not cold at all. Within 15 minutes, chills began and increased quickly to an almost violent state. I was shivering so badly, it became painful and scary. My husband added three blankets on top of our down comforter and sent me to bed. It took approx 15 minutes to warm up, stop shivering, and slow teeth chattering enough to relax and fall asleep. Awoke around 1:30am feeling incredibly thirsty and in desperate need of water. Upon standing, the pain in my body was excruciating which made it extremely difficult to walk. Finally in the kitchen, I took Ibuprofen 800mg and filled a large bottle with water. I began to feel incredibly dizzy and needed help from my husband to get to the couch. It took approximately 2 hours before I began to feel any relief from the ibuprofen. Around 6:30 a.m., about 60 to 65% of the pain had abated and I had finished around 100oz of water. The remainder of the day was spent feeling extreme fatigue and a general sense of unwell. Appetite was poor throughout entire event. This all continued into the evening until bedtime at 11pm. Experienced moderate insomnia overnight, falling asleep around 2:30am. Could not fall asleep due to constantly thinking about the stress of the previous 24&#43; hours. Upon waking this morning, I feel almost back up to 100%.

                                                About 7 hours after the vaccine injection I started to feel flu-like symptoms: aches, chills, woozy and slightly nauseous. Within the next few hours the symptoms became increasingly worse, but not different other than the addition of a headache. I took 2 Tylenol to help with the headache and fever. Overnight sleep was difficult due to chills, sweats, fever dreams and aches. The symptoms lessened the next day (24-hours post injection), but still included muscle/body aches, headache, and extreme fatigue. Again took 2 Tylenol to help. Today (48-hours post injection) I&#39;m feeling quite a bit better although still not 100%. Soreness at injection site persists, especially when lifting my arm.

I have a herniated disc in my lower back and this was severely aggravated by the vaccine. My back and fingers hurt so bad I couldn?t sleep at all. Tried not to take Tylenol finally took some after 3-4 hours and it helped a lot with fever and joint pain. Also had a headache. Fever and pain was gone after 8 hours. Then felt very low energy with a headache all the second day. Third day I felt great except are sore.

                                                Day of vaccine, I felt like my lymph nodes were swollen. Two days later the injection site started to get deep red. Friday I started to about an inch of so, swell up some. Saturday I had a rash on my arm by the injection site, the top part on my bicep was pretty red and swollen. I didn&#39;t take my Humara or Zolar injection. On Sunday the rash got worse and grew in size and really hot to touch, the pain was radiating all the way to my wrist and hurt really bad causing pain when I moved my wrist. It was hard for me to go to sleep so I called the dr and went in . The dr. said it looked less red that what it was and told me to take Ibuprofen 800mg* 3x day.  The pain is now in both wrist and hard for to grip stuff and a little hot to touch.  You can see the difference in the skin tone where the rash was, it looks bruised.

Most of the symptoms lasted for a couple days, by Friday the 12th I was fever free and muscle aches went away. The day after the vaccine I blacked out at school, the nurse took my pulse and blood pressure and everything seemed ok. My husband picked me up and I went home to sleep.  Sunday the 21st for the firs today I made it through the day without sleeping or having any issues.  I did go to the Dr. for a follow  up my heart was a little up and down but still within the normal wrong.  She told me to take a week off.

                                                I received my shot at 9:15AM at 11.5 hours later I began feeling foggy, fatigue and flu like symptoms. I had a slight fever and just stayed in bed the day after. Ibuprofen seemed to help the headaches but not the body aches. No nausea. Within 72 hours I was almost back to my normal self, but still extremely tired, and my neck and back hurt quite a bit. Today marks 13 days. As of 5 days ago I began to get cold like symptoms. Neck and back still extremely uncomfortable, neck barely able to move side to side. I have a bit of a cough with phlegm. Headaches are still happening quite a bit, and still super tired all the time. I feel like I?ve been sick ever since I took the shot, and have to take several days off work.

I woke up at about 05:00 am with a fever of 101.6. My heart rate was elevated - racing heart. I took some more Tylenol -and I tried to sleep but it was hard to. After a few hours, I felt achy and sore but better. Three days later, had a run of skipped heart beats (Thursday) and heart palpitations. I called my regular doctor on Monday and on Thursday, I called the Cardiologist. I take a beta blocker when I have bad heart palpitations and they continued to happen but were better with the beta blocker. Within a few hours, on Thursday, the symptoms resolved. I still have heart palpitations but the vaccine may have increased them.

                                                about eight hours after receiving the injection, I started to feel strong aching in my muscles and joints (most strongly felt in neck, hands, jaw, inner ear, but also including legs and feet).  I also felt chills.  My temperature was 98.8 F.  Over the course of the next three or four hours, I have felt strong sensations of aching and throbbing in my chest, back, hands, inner ears, and neck.  I also felt pins and needles all over but most strongly in chest, back, hands, inner ears, and sides of my neck.

                                                Patient received her vaccine at 11:30 AM.  Immediately after receiving the Jansen vaccine, the patient reported feeling lightheaded as she stood up.  She sat in our waiting area for about 10 minutes, and reported that she felt as though her tongue was swelling.  We contacted EMS at this point, and provided a dose of Benadryl to the patient at her request.  We brought the patient into our vaccine room where she began to break out into hives.  She vomited several times.  EMS arrived shortly thereafter and checked to see if the patient was experiencing an allergic reaction.  EMS took the patient to the hospital.  At about 2 PM, the patient called the pharmacy to let us know that she was okay.  She said that it was confirmed as an allergic reaction at the hospital.  She indicated that she had received a steroid injection at the hospital and was feeling much better.  We encouraged the patient to call us at any time if she had any further problems or questions.

                                                I had a very bad case of Covid in January 2021 and have not regained my taste or smell.  I was in bed for 2 weeks and had a prolonged fever up to 105 degrees--so high that I had visual and auditory hallucinations.  I had hair loss in the following months and I also continue to be fatigued.    I received the vaccination on 4/6/21 around 11am; a slight headache and face flushing occurred about 30 minutes after shot, but generally felt ok.  Woke up at 4am on 4/7/21 with chills, extreme joint pain, body aches, migraine headache, and a fever of 101.5 degrees.  Took Tylenol around 6am and went back to bed.  The migraine headache, chills, body aches, and extreme joint pain continued.  I was dizzy and extremely fatigued.  Woke up around 9 am and fever was at 102.7 degrees.  Joint pain and headache were almost unbearable at this point and I took a hydrocodone.  Took temperature around 12 pm and it was 103.5 degrees.  Fever continued rising to 104.4 degrees at 2:30 pm.  Took another Tylenol and went to sleep.  The next day, my fever had fallen back down to 102.5 degrees.  I continued with Tylenol to control me fever to around 101 degrees.   My fever persisted for 3 days.  I still have extreme fatigue, joint pain, burning scalp (which will likely mean more hair loss), zero appetite and weight loss, dizziness, blurred vision, etc.  The side effects are exactly how i felt when I got Covid in January.

                                                At 5:30 pm, I started to have a headache, so I took some Tylenol.  I started to feel a little better.  From about 7:00 pm to about midnight, I felt awful.  I couldn&#39;t walk down a short hall without assistance.  I was so sore and achy I couldn&#39;t really sleep.  I felt insanely hot, yet had chills and I had a terrible headache.  I am type 1 diabetic, and my blood sugar spiked to over 200, where it hovered between 200 &amp; 300 most of the night, despite the fact that I used insulin to try and lower it.  From 10 pm to midnight, I felt nauseous.  Overnight was ok.  I still had some of those symptoms, but could sleep off and on.  I probably woke up every couple of hours.  I was till very sore and hot, but not as hot, and still had a headache.  Today, I took Tylenol this morning.  I still have a mild headache, sore body, tired and a little slow, but significantly better than last night.

Patient stated she started feeling nauseous and light headed so asked if she can wait outside for some fresh air. When she went outside, she sat on the edge of the stairs and fell backwards and passed out. The store manager was there to catch her before her head hit the pavement. Patient wasn&#39;t alert for about 2 minutes. Pharmacist came out and assessed the patient and she was communicative. She was in and out but was able to tell us her name, DOB and where she was. We sat her up,  gave her some water, and waited with her. She requested not to call the ambulance. I checked her pulse at 1:15pm and it was 92. I checked her pulse again at 1:30pm and it went down to 72. Patient was fully alert and speaking in full sentences by 1:35pm. She called her mom and was able to stand up without feeling dizzy. She walked to the car with assistance and was driven home by her mother.

About 2 hours later the chills were alternating with fever and I could barely stand because I felt so weak from the muscle aches. I was in so much physical pain I didn&#39;t sleep at all that night. The fever lasted until late afternoon the next day (about 24 hrs total), and the body aches lasted until late afternoon the day after that (about 48 hrs total).

Still painful swollen sore throat. By that evening, my chest was tight and I was having difficult breathing because of swollen throat. I called doctor, 26th, and got some meds. He gave me Singulair and Flonase and a cough suppressant - Benzonatate.  I am almost back to normal today - just still have some congestion and a little bit of a cough.

In addition to the shaking, I ran a fever of 102 F, and my heart began racing - my husband is an RN and he checked my blood pressure which was normal and my heart rate which was 122 ( normal for me is about 72). Until about 6am my heart continued to race, and even with Advil and Tylenol my fever didn?t stop until  the next morning.    The next two days I felt pretty beat up, had a headache, and have been very tired.

                                                Patient felt dizzy during 15 minute wait time after given Janssen COVID19 vaccination and wanted to lay down on the floor but stressed that she was fine and just needed some water.

In the morning I took ibuprofen which brought the fever down and took care of the headache. The fever did not return, but I took another dose of ibuprofen about 5 hours after the first for a returning headache. Today is the 6th and the pain in my arm (injection site) is still fairly intense and especially to the touch.

                                                The injection site was really sore. Ran high fever and had flu like symptoms for about 15 hours. Then those symptoms stopped but the injection site pain continued. The intensity of the pain grew for about 3 weeks. Then pain extended to neck and shoulder blade. Went to urgent care  for the  arm/neck/shoulder pain. Took neck X-rays. Given a steroid shot and an another shot I think for inflammation. Prescribed a muscle relaxer.

It was also swollen with redness, itching, and it was hot. . Never had a fever. I immediately started taking Benadryl every 4 hours. I had really bad nausea (no vomiting)  to the point I was unable to eat and lost 7 lbs. I had really bad cold sweats so bad I was drenched with sweat multiple times a day for over a week. I ended up going to the walk in clinic about 5 days after the injection and was given Zofran for nausea.  I was also told I had a moderate allergic reaction to the vaccine and any other time they would start me on steroids but they said if I took steroids it would make the vaccine not work. So I was told to continue Benadryl and deal with it.  To this day which will be two weeks tomorrow since I received the shot I still have a hard hot lump in my arm, I still break out in cold sweats, and still have a little nausea.  Never had wheezing or issues breathing though.

Woke up with headache and chills at 3:15am.  Took temperature - no fever (98.0).  Went back to sleep until 6am.  Woke up with a headache and chills again and took temperature again - no fever (98.6).  Could only stomach ginger tea.  Attended a computer work meeting at 7am, and couldn&#39;t stay awake after that.  Was back in bed before 8am.  Slept until 10:45am (24 hours after injection) and woke up feeling OK and hungry.  It&#39;s now 1:45 pm April 8, and I feel mostly fine but still unusually tired.

I can?t stand for more than about 5 minutes without feeling dizziness and nausea set in, even getting on my bike causes nausea and dizziness, driving, walking, anything related to movement. **Only had one vaccine - the form added a second set of boxes above and won?t let me remove it on this form.

That night I ran a fever of 102 and had horrible chills and nausea. The next day these were gone but I had a horrible headache that even Tylenol wouldn?t get rid of. The second day these symptoms had stopped.

Couldn&#39;t walk was shaking so much.  Speaking was difficult.  Breath was labored.  It was so scary my husband called the doctor.  Shook violently with teeth chattering for 45 minutes then would break for a few minutes before shaking again.  The shaking was probably 60 minutes total.  Then fever set in.  Fever hit 102.4 at 6:15pm.  102.9 at 6:40pm.  103.8 at 8:15pm.  Fever ranged between 102.3 and 103.8 for 8 hours after starting then finally broke 1:45am (8 1/2 hours after the shaking started).  Was able to get out of bed 8:00am today.  Massive headache for the morning but no fever today.  26 1/2 hours post vaccine new and I just feel very tired and drained.

I sat on the floor and started vomiting. I kept gagging nonstop for several minutes. During that time I urinated on myself, I felt strong stomach aches, headache, and my body felt extremely fatigued.  I was dizzy and sweating. All these symptoms came back again a few minutes later. I do not remember how long everything lasted. I woke up the next day with a slightly upset stomach and headache.

Left Arm immediately felt odd---sore, heavy, tingly all the way down to my wrist.  By noon, I was asleep.  Slept for about 3 hours.  Up for 3 hours.  Slept for 3.  Up for 3.  Then slept all night.   I had a headache and slept most of the next day.  Definitely felt like my body was fighting something.     I have an approximately 3 inch diameter circle around injection site that is a red, swollen, hard, lump,  It is hot to the touch and extremely sore---at times it itches.  I am shocked how big and hard the knot is.  Its crazy!  I cannot put weight on that arm.  Extremely sore.  It is now 4 days after the vaccine and the knot does not seem to be getting smaller.  In fact, it may be bigger.

I took 400 mg of ibuprofen and was able to sleep.  The following day I had intense body aches and extreme exhaustion all day long.  I managed it through doses of ibuprofen.  I was able to sleep all night the following night with some NyQuil.  The second day, I woke up feeling still a little weak and tired, but the body aches have subsided significantly.  It&#39;s nothing crazy, but it felt like I should report so there is more information for the researchers and public.  I did have COVID March/April 2020.  I had body aches, fatigue, chest tightness, loss of taste and smell, but NO FEVER.  It was undiagnosed at the time (no fever), but in October 2020, I gave blood and I did have COVID antibodies.  I gave again in January 2021 and I still had the COVID antibodies.  I received the vaccine March 10.  Thank you!

                                                Around 7 pm on 3/13, I developed brain fog, trouble walking, and then fever, severe muscle pain worse in legs, and chills.  Most of these symptoms seemed to improve on 3/14, but then on 3/15, I developed new onset of shortness of breath and chest discomfort.  On 3/16 around 1 pm the shortness of breath worsened and I went to the emergency room.  I felt that I couldn&#39;t take a deep breath in and I had chest discomfort on the left side of my chest worse when taking a deep breath.  My legs were hurting as well, especially my left leg.  I had sinus tachycardia (heart rate 106-120) and increased respiratory rate (rate of 20)  with O2 sats 100% on room air.   My breathing and heart rate improved somewhat with 1 liter oxygen therapy, 1 liter of IV fluids, albuterol inhaler, and decadron 6 mg orally.  It was thought that I had a delayed asthmatic/allergic reaction to the vaccine.  I do not have a history of asthma.  I was prescribed a Medrol dose pack and albuterol inhaler.  My hands and feet are very cold and tingling on 3/18.  Shortness of breath and chest pain seems to have improved but not completely gone as of the time of this submission on 3/18.

                                                I started getting fatigued around 7:00 pm that evening. It was hard to finish walking my dog. I was getting the chills to the point that my teeth were chattering.  I couldn&#39;t wear a shirt at this point because it felt like sandpaper on my back, but I did not have a rash.  I went to bed earlier than normal and woke up around 11:30 with the worst headache of my life.  My head was throbbing and pulsating and any little movement made it worse. The bottom of my head hurt, where my head connects to my neck.  My lower back hurt.  I woke up every 1 1/2 hours in pain, due to terrible headache.  After suffering for several hours, I finally took some Aleve at 7:00 a.m. the morning following the vaccine.

                                                My left arm started hurting on Friday  March 19 and is still hurting. I can not sleep on the left side since getting the vaccine. It hurts to move the arm different ways. Many times, I have to lay flat to  get relief from the pain. I don&#39;t have alot of strength in my left arm since getting the vaccine. I consulted the school nurse about my effects and she stated it could be an inflamed nerve.

                                                As soon as the shot was administered in the deltoid muscle within 3 seconds my axillary node was on fire and I couldn&#39;t put my arm at rest.  Extremely painful in my armpit.  The injection nurse said that is not normal and gave me a sheet to report to the CDC scan code.  My entire left arm was on fire within a minute.  She had me sit for 30 minutes.  I had no other reaction.  My arm was subsiding a little bit to toleration.  I went home and rested, drank a ton of water.  I went to bed and woke up at 2 am in a cold sweat, I felt like I was freezing and could not stop shaking.  My teeth chattered.  My husband put on many blankets and helped me get warm.  He said I was burning up.  My muscles were so weak and painful, joints hurt and extreme head ache.  I took some Advil and he warmed me up.  My left arm was numb up my left side of my neck and my left cheek.  I took the day off work.  In addition, in the morning I felt like my left leg and foot had minor numbness and prickles.  I could walk but it was colder and prickled on the foot each step.  The next day I was 50% better and made it to work barely.  It took me 3 days to recover from the flu like symptoms.   My left arm continued to feel numb and had bouts of prickles and tingling.  The muscles were hard to use in my left arm and I really didn&#39;t use it at all.  Over the course of 2 weeks things have improved.  I still have not recovered feeling in my left pinky and ring finger.  They are weaker still today.  Every morning my left arm is numb for a little while (I don&#39;t sleep on my left side) but recovers to about 75% except my pinky and ring finger.  My left neck and cheek have a warming prickle feeling every morning for about a half hour.  They mostly wake up to entirety.  My L foot at the bottom has period/episodic prickles.   Daily my left arm is colder and is weaker than before.  I am a high school teacher so I don&#39;t have to use my left arm very much but it is causing pain and negative sensations and is reducing the amount of use of my left arm.

The patient was placed onto the ground and EMS was called at 12:10.  She came to and was able to state her name. EMS arrived and performed their assessment. She stayed lying for several minutes and was eventually able to sit up. She was coherent and she was cleared by EMS to go home.  She was able to leave the facility walking with minimal to no assistance and was driven home by her husband. She stayed until 12:45

I didn&#39;t take my temperature. Another thing that happened was the tip of my right middle finger went numb for a few hours. I noticed this around 7pm the day I got the shot. This numbness has never happened to me before. My fever lasted until the morning after I got my shot. Fatigue lasted into the second day after the shot.

I had, in this order, compounded, with the peak happening about 12 hours afterwards: immediate dizziness about 10 minutes after the shot, nausea started about 30 min, at 4 hours a strong headache that didn?t go away until now, took Tylenol at 7pm, stiffness in the joints, hands, and feet started about 6 hours of shot, at 8 hours pain in the shoulders and neck, at 12 hours cramping all down my back and my hips and low fever. Fever continued until around 6am despite taking more tilt at 2am. Finally got to sleep at 6am. Woke with remaining stiffness and headache at 7:30am. Nausea continued for another 6 hours. Headache continued for another 6 hours. Muscles remained sore due to severe cramping last night.

When I got up the next day, I had a horrible migraine and I felt like I had COVID again. The migraine continued and I went to the doctor on Thursday. I took Tylenol, but it only provided like 2 hours of relief. It didn&#39;t resolve the pain, but it did lessen it. My doctor told me to try an OTC med first, so I tried Extra Strength Excedrin and it went away. The first day that I didn&#39;t have a headache was exactly a week later. I&#39;m not sure if they will return, but you&#39;re fine right now.

                                                I got the vaccine on Tuesday. That night, I had some slight aches and was warm, but nothing awful. The next day, I was just a bit warm. I exercised on Thursday morning because I felt better (stand up paddling). Then the rest of the day, I was very tired and then Friday and Saturday and Sunday, I was very dizzy, foggy, fatigued, no mental clarity, difficult to hold a conversation and answer questions, no focus. Today, Monday, I still feel like I have a brain fog and am talking very slowly. No focus. Conversations feel tiring.

The rest of the day I had the normal symptoms- Pounding headache, nausea, horrible body aches (couldn?t lay down or stand to be comfortable).  That night around 11:45pm I got up to let my dog in and I started seeing small black dots- blurry vision.  I felt nauseas.  I ended up falling on the floor.  I was able to get up.  I then ended up waking up in the bathroom on the floor and had no idea how I had gotten there.  My hands were vibrating.  I called my husband from work to come help me up.  I was able to sleep and didn?t seek medical attention.  I am not sure if it was low blood pressure or what could have happened I have never experienced that before.  I did contact my doctor?s office this afternoon via (online) but haven?t had a response yet.  I have been in bed all day today.  - Body aches, nausea, pounding headache

I was tired for 3 days after. Now the only remaining symptom is living in a fog. I have no health conditions. I am praying this goes away. I am not one to get sick or have any health issues. I don&#39;t use drugs or drink, smoke etc. Very scary. It is impacting my ability to do my job.

Patient was unconscious for roughly 15 seconds. We checked pulse and positioned on the floor. Once responsive patient said she was feeling okay. She said she faints when she gets anxious (this was not disclosed before vaccine was given). She spoke with EMS who determined she did not need immediate care. She waited another roughly 30 minutes and was able to leave the pharmacy.

I wasn?t able to wake my husband and remained as calm as possible. I drifted in and out of sleep. By 4am I was able to wake my husband. He used our elevating bed to sit me up and gave me ibuprofen and water through a straw (not sure why that was his solution and just thankful I?m here today to type this response). By 6am I had terrible shooting pains in my hands, fingers and then Charlie horses in my feet and calves. That is when the ability to move came back. At that point I was extremely fatigued and exhausted and felt like I had a terrible flu. I was in bed for the next 6 hours clammy and  sweaty and in a very achy.  24 hours after the vaccine I was back on my feet.  50 some hours after the vaccine I still have an aching in my hip on my left side and tenderness at the injection site.

Pt reported feeling hot and sat down in a chair available in the restroom. Pt and nurse joined by a second nurse. Shortly after sitting down pt complained of feeling dizzy and was moved to the floor to lay down. When laying down, pt appeared flushed under her chin and complained of chest tightness. She requested to sit up to help with breathing. Called 911 and first dose of epinephrine (0.5 mL of 1mg/1mL) administered, both at 4:10 pm. Pt reported no change in chest tightness following epi, but continued to respond to questions. She said she felt tired and wanted to go to sleep. Pt continued to report difficulty breathing, and another dose of epinephrine administered at 4:15 pm. A physician at GEO arrived and administered oxygen. He listened to pt&#39;s heart and lungs and reported that there was air movement in her lungs. Pt ceased to respond coherently to questions, slurring and moaning, but did not lose consciousness. Pt started tapping her lips and, upon questioning, said they felt numb. Third dose of epinephrine administered at 4:20 pm. Nurse continued to jostle patient and ask her questions, and patient continued to respond with short, slurred answers. EMS arrived at 4:23 pm and transported patient to the hospital.

I was laid on the pharmacy floor immediately after reactions with a cold pack under my neck and my feet elevated. Within 5 minutes I was able to open my eyes and able to stand. I left with some dizziness and a headache that remained for a few days. I also had severe body aches for a couple of days and fatigue. Only thing is the arm pain and a little tiredness today.

The next morning I woke with a mild headache, body aches started to return around 10:30am as the Tylenol wore off. Additional 400 mg of Tylenol was taken. General fatigue was experienced the rest of the day. After the 2nd night of sleep I felt fine.

It was 103.7.  I took two tylenol and my fever broke about 40 minutes later. I was so hot. I checked my temp again and it was 102. I tried to eat and drink but I felt sick. I did drink water. I got chills again and took another tylenol. My temp went to 101.  I&#39;ve had fever and chills all night. I kept taking tylenol and my fever has stayed between 100- 101. I forced myself to eat soup and I took more tylenol.  My current temp is 99.6. I have a throbbing headache. It is 7:15AM.

I could hardly move and felt an ache in all my muscles and bones.  It was very intense pain.  The entire next day I had severe body pain and severe fatigue.  I tried to go for a short walk and felt dizzy.  Everything hurt.  I took Tylenol regularly all day and mostly slept.  48 hours later I was feeling better.  Slowly regaining stamina and pain is now diminising.

                                                I received my vaccine and then was told to go sit in the waiting area.  After 5 minutes or so I noticed my throat feeling thick like it was swelling.  I turned my head from side to side to make sure my throat was swelling (I&#39;ve had anaphylaxis before).  I got up and went to one of the people in the vests and they took me to the medical tent.  They took my oxygen rate, blood pressure, and checked my heart rate.  I was given (2)  25 mg of Diphen(Benadryl) .  I was monitored till 4 pm when I was released.

                                                Around four hours later began with a head, heart beat really fast, small fever, extreme nausea and IBS-like symptoms (gas pains and diarrhea), fatigue. The later lasted for nearly a week, but the rest were gone by day 3. I did not see a dr as my fever never got very high and only occurred the first night. The nausea last maybe a day and a half. I am about two weeks out and I seem to be having a gluten skin reaction (dermatitis herpetiformis) and given most of the symptoms I listed could also be celiac symptoms, I was curious if there was gluten in the shot as it was very much like an extreme reaction to gluten that I normally get with celiac. I usually see gluten rashes a couple of weeks to a month after being exposed and I was not exposed to anything during the last few weeks that could be causing it (that I know of). The nurse who gave me the shot did not know if there was gluten in the shot. Hence, I know the first symptoms were definitely related to the shot, but not if the current rash is from the shot (because gluten, this is definitely DH and not an allergy rash). I hope this helps, if other celiacs have also had a hard time.

Woke up around 7 am feeling better. Mild heat flashes until about noon. Felt fine the rest of the day. On Thursday 3/25 around 6pm I started developing hives, itching and red rashes on bilateral lower legs. Thighs, knees, feet and ankles. I waited several hours to see if it would go away and it did not. By 10:30 pm it was much worse. I took a 25mg Benadryl tab. Rash went away. On Friday 3/26 rash and hives, itching and red rashes returned. Both kneecaps very red and hot. It mainly stayed on lower legs until about 5 pm. The rash then started on bilateral arms. I took another Benadryl at 6pm. It is currently 7pm.

Body chills started around 1am, by 7:00 a.m., I had headache and dizziness, with extreme fatigue. I almost passed out after breaking out in cold sweat by 8:30 a.m. Started running a fever around 9:30 a.m. Took Tylenol for headache and body pain. Slept until 1:30p.m. Woke with a fever of 101.4 and severe headache. Took more Tylenol and laid back down.   By 4:30p.m. I was able to lift my head off a pillow and walk without dizziness. Chills and low-grade fever returned around 6:30pm. Went to sleep.   Woke at 7:30 am. No headache, slight fatigue, sore arm. No fever, no dizziness.

Fingertips still feel like electricity is running through them and fingers/hands still hurt; extremely hungry/thirsty from 03/25/2021 - 03/29/2021; fatigue, pain at base of skull under ears, tinnitus extremely loud and both ears feel like ear ache; During the night of my high fever, lower back where kidneys are started hurting very badly.  What is still left of that pain on day 5 is a pain radiating from my lower back down my right leg many times throughout the day (treating with ibuphrophen).   Pain around knees, elbows, ankles, and bottom of feet- different than joint pain.  All my POTS symptoms are in high gear (tachycardias, very low BP,  pain, dizzy, vertigo).    If the leg/lower back pain, and left arm problems continue, I will see my neurologist or immunologist.  I have reached out to both to make them aware.  My husband had the JJ shot same day, same place and had zero side affects.

                                                I was directed to my seat (if walking into the room, the first table but the 2nd seat).  The woman was learning the computer system from a gentleman, and she assured me she just didn&#39;t know the computer, but knew how to give a shot.  I pulled my arm out of my sweatshirt and pushed my short sleeve shirt up.  She did the alcohol wipe, then pinched my arm, I looked away as the shot went in.  I felt a horrible pain...not even sure how to describe it, just extreme pain and very achy and said Ow maybe 3 times (I am one that can tolerate quite a bit of pain, and I assumed it would sting, but this was different) as she was injecting me.  She apologized. The gentleman said Johnson and Johnson is a little thicker.  I said to him that I had never ever experienced this much pain with a vaccine before-never.  Again, I am talking about as it was injected. I went to sit down for the waiting area, the gentleman who was handing out cards for reviews asked me about it and I said it hurt so bad, I&#39;d never had a shot hurt that bad.  Another worker (female) overheard me and asked me if it was a burning-she had a burning with hers (think she said moderna). I said I would not necessarily say it was a burning, it was pain. As I sat there, I texted my husband and told him how bad it hurt (with the injection) and I&#39;ve never had a vaccine hurt like that.  I started to wonder if it was administered incorrectly? I looked over and the gentleman was now doing the vaccines and she was watching. My husband had Pfizer and he said that didn&#39;t hurt at all. I was feeling it up into my neck as I was sitting there. I was trying to rub my arm and neck hoping that would help as well as move my arm around. When we could leave, I asked the volunteer if she had heard of anyone else having that much pain DURING the shot.  She said she only heard of maybe one other person that said ow. I left, started to cry in the car because of the pain and experience, then spoke with my husband before I left. I came home and got some ice to put on my arm hoping that would help. I did expect pain in the arm after a shot. Within a couple of hours, I noticed pain going down my arm and into my wrist. I thought maybe I needed to be active with my arm and move it so tried that.  I started to notice more side effects of the vaccine as the evening progressed:  I had the typical side effects I figured I&#39;d have, achy, joint pain, chills, nauseous, no fever though. I was noticing pain into my neck (occasionally even into jaw), shoulder, scapula area of the back, and left side under the bottom part of my ribs.  I was feeling tightness in my chest, too, so I decided to try 2 aspirin to see if it helped with any symptoms. I did have slight dizziness, and a weird sensation in my head-like a zapping? I didn&#39;t sleep well, and had to stay completely off of my left side. Thursday, I felt better than that night, but still tired, achy, nauseous, chills, and not 100%.  My arm still was really affected...it seemed extremely fatigued as well as painful...the pain was radiating up and down and couldn&#39;t raise my arm without it hurting. Around noon I decided to take 2 aleve to see if that would help me at all. It did help with the pain and achiness, but was getting a &#34;nerve-type&#34; pain still up and down my left arm into neck/scapula area down to my wrist and hand/fingers. Still couldn&#39;t sleep on my left side. Friday, I was definitely doing better with all the other symptoms, I could abduct my arm more than 90 degrees, so I was excited about that. I did wake up with my middle/ring finger hurting (at the base of that area) and a bit numb so put my hand in and out of a fist. The pain subsided, but the numbness/tingling sensation was still there. I continued to take aleve hoping that maybe there was just inflammation around the nerve causing the issue.  Aleve did help, but it still never went away completely.  By late afternoon, I was getting concerned if I was permanently affected by this. As I was holding a bowl of food and eating, my left arm was going numb. I was even feeling it into my gluts (sciatica?). Again...all of this was after the shot and only on the side I received the shot. That evening I was able to lay on my left side, but not for long periods of time because it became uncomfortable and arm would go numb. Saturday, I still had the nerve pain and was not in a good spot.  It made me sad, angry, scared, and I didn&#39;t want to talk about it too much-just wanted my arm and all the different radiating pains I was having to be back to normal. I was feeling it up into my neck, scapula, my side(the rib area I previously mentioned), even into my gluts and down leg near ankle as well as down the arm into elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand, fingers (particularly that middle finger and thumb area).  I tried to use my arm as normally as possible thinking maybe I need to just keep it moving, but it would fatigue, especially between shoulder and neck. I tried Ibuprofen on this day.  Again, the pain relievers helped some, but didn&#39;t take it all away. Sunday I was in a horrible spot mentally and crying throughout the day because of the sensations I was feeling still: up and down the arm, shoulder, neck, scapula, side and still into ankle area. I decided I would call my doctor on Monday. Monday, I woke up and was feeling better overall, but still having the nerve sensations down my arm as well as up into shoulder, neck, scapula and my left side.  But everything was not as intense.  I spoke to my doctor who said there was a protocol, a number I needed to call.  Monday night I took ibuprofen because I started to have a horrible headache-didn&#39;t go away completely and still have this morning-not sure if it&#39;s related or just a normal headache. Still feeling tingling nerve sensations into forearm and fingers.  My shoulder/neck area feels fatigued, but so far not noticing the nerve pain yet, so that&#39;s a positive. On Monday,  it seemed to get worse as the day went on, so we will see. I definitely feel in hand/wrist/fingers as I am typing now. I know this is a lot, and I think I&#39;ve captured it.  Again, I had none of this pre-shot.  The pain during injection is what alarmed me most as I expected side effects after the shot, but not this nerve type issue.  For this to be lasting as long as it is concerns me, and the fact that it exhibits on my left side where I got the shot. I am very anxious as it hasn&#39;t gotten back to normal.

Also low grade fever with sweats and mild sore throat.  Arm was mildly sore at injection site for several days.  Headache and fatigue continued for three full days. On 5th and 6th day after vaccine, had diarrhea.  Was told by doctor at vaccine event not to take any anti-inflammatories for 3 to 5 days.  He said Tylenol was ok.  Took Tylenol day after vaccine when adverse effects were the worst and it did not help at all.  Finally took Advil on day 4 and it relieved headache.  Now 7 days after vaccine still have intermittent headache.

                                                Flu-like symptoms developed and got progressively worse in the first 12 hours after the vaccine and remained for approximately 36 hours.  The flu-like symptoms included muscle aches, nausea, stomach pain including more significant pain in the upper left stomach area, headache and fatigue with difficulty sleeping.  I needed to take time off from work due to these side effects and had difficulty performing daily activities.  Also experienced pain at injection site that got worse in the first 12 hours and lasted also approximately 36 hours.  Minor nausea, stomach pain and injection site pain have continued after 36 hours with ability to return to daily living activities.

                                                I received the vaccine on March 27, 2021. Seconds after the injection was completed my vision went blurry, but it only lasted a few seconds. On March 28, 2021 I felt like my body was going to explode. My blood in the back of my head was thumping. I tried to take a nap to calm my body down but my body felt comp!eye unrest and thumping. My urine made the whole inside of the toilet water look like a white thick cloud.  I have never seen my urine look like that in my life. I used my husbands blood pressure monitor and my blood pressure was 152/104!  I arrived at urgent care about 5:30 PM. They gave me a blood pressure pill. I have never had a blood pressure pill my entire life. They also took a urine sample since I told them about the my very strange looking urine. They found protein and blood in my urine. The culture days later showed no infection. I am still having issues with the high blood pressure.

NO FEVER but major body aches and soreness. AFter the chills wore off I was in a sweat..this pattern of chills, vs soaking sweats continued throughout the night. Add to that dry heaves due to nausea but no vomiting. The dry heaves just added to the muscle pains that I already had. I was in bed until 5 pm the next day, no energy, sore body aches to the point that my skin hurt. still no soreness in my arm at all. I finally had the strength to get out of bed at 5pm took a shower and ate 2 pieces of toast to combat the nausea. Fast forward next day, felt fine and arm was mildly sore at injection sight. SO glad J and J is only one dose.. I would have dreaded a second day like that.

I took two Advil&#39;s and went down to 100. Around 10am the next morning it broke. I went to see my Doctor thought that my immune system over reacted to the vaccine as I haven&#39;t been out in a year or been sick, she wasn&#39;t too concerned about it. I&#39;ve had some stomach issues- mild diarrhea and stomach pain. Not sure it has to do with the vaccine.

Dizziness lasted for a few minutes which created nausea. Sat at site for approximately 25 minutes after shot. Left arm was sore between shoulder and elbow, which was to be expected. Later in the evening, experienced fatigue. When trying to go to bed around 11pm,  my left are was throbbing. I did take Tylenol at about 6pm. Throughout the AM hours, sever body aches started, extreme fatigue throughout the following day. Flu like symptoms continued the next day.  I had heard of these symptoms for the other shots but not for Johnson and Johnson. Hungry but too weak to actually cook.

At the time the muscle spasm started, I had low fever (99.3F).  After the first spasm peak, it came in waves until it easy off.  Fever increased after end of spasm, peaking at 103F. Fever was controlled with Tylenol (325mg). Approximately 24h after vaccination, no more fever was detected.

I only had children?s Tylenol so I took that but it did not treat the symptoms. Thirteen hours later I took extra strength Tylenol and that helped with the treatment of most of the symptoms. About eighteen hours later I started to feel better. I had residual hot flashes 48 hours later.

                                                I discovered patient on the floor at approx. 3:03pm. She was lying face down on the floor next to the chair she was sitting on during her 15-minute observation post-covid19 vaccine. Unknown person turned patient over face-up, Face was clammy and warm/hot to the touch. Pulse was taken (weak). Sweating. Eyes were closed when EpiPen was injected on left thigh through pants. It was decided to inject patient as we did not know what exactly happened, why she was on the floor, and she was unconscious at the time we initially thought to give epi injection. 1 pen injected. Pharmacist called emergency services at 3:05pm. Patient eventually regained consciousness while waiting for the paramedics. She was able to talk and answer questions. She was taken outside the gym on stretcher, but her son met us at the school to pick her up. She declined going to the hospital for further treatment.

In the evening, began to experience extreme fatigue, and in morning of Saturday, March 13th, 2021 began to experience fever, 100.3F, very bad headache, fatigue, and bad muscle aches--aching legs, back. Fever has is gone as of afternoon March 13th, however,  still experiencing headache, fatigue, and aching muscles, similar with what I experience when I had influenza B a couple of years back.

                                                2 hours after the vaccine, I started to feel very achy, and had terrible chills.  That lasted through the night and I woke up with a slight fever, 99.9.  The aches were in my joints and muscles.  It actually felt like I was having back labor. I took advil, and I was able to sleep and sweat out the fever. These symptoms were similar to one of my worst Lupus flares.  These symptoms lasted until Tuesday, 3/9/21, afternoon.  The following Sunday, my joints feel extremely stiff and achy.  Not sure if it has anything to do with the vaccine.  I took Advil and it seemed to help.

It felt like my bones were made out of glass and someone had taken a hammer to my bones.  My face was swollen and red.  Unable to sit up.  Walk from bed to toilet only.  Overall, I would say extreme flu-like symptoms.  Temperature 99.6 all day.   I could not take the pain any further at 4:20 pm and took 1,000 mg of Tylenol.  I finally fell asleep and woke up at 8:30pm and could walk again and my fever had broken.  I still don&#39;t feel great, but I think the worst is behind me.

The staff noticed I was in some distress and kept asking if I was okay to which I replied I thought I&#39;d be fine once I got some fresh air.  Left the facility to drive home and didn&#39;t feel right, Within 30 minutes, developed chest pains, rash and labored breathing.  I recognize the symptoms as the same symptoms I get when I&#39;ve had morphine, which I now must list as an allergy.  This lasted 4 hours, then got better.  The next day around 1:00, I became ill again with flu-like symptoms and had to leave work.  Headache and body aches mostly.  I was ill with these symptoms for a 24 hour period.  Hopefully all symptoms have passed, except my arm which is red, swollen, itchy and feverish.

                                                6 hours after shot I began to feel major muscle aches and chills. Within an hour of this onset I had a fever of 102.4 and was wearing 2 coats, had the heat blasting, and was in  many many blankets and still chilled. This went on for about 7 hours. Also during this time my heart rate was elevated to about 100 beats per minute (normal is 60-65 for me). and also the hear beat seemed &#39;loud&#39; like someone was dribbling a basketball in my head (maybe this is a sinus symptom??). After these symptoms subsided I had a splitting headache for several more hours.

                                                I started feeling nauseous right away, so I had to wait for 30 min. Later that night I started throwing up. I was sick for almost 3 days. I rested a lot because I couldn&#39;t move because I was so tired, achy, really cold and I threw up everything I happened. I waited to contact my doctor in hopes that it would go away, but I couldn&#39;t stop vomiting. By that Monday, I decided to get help. I was told to go to the hospital to get rehydrated. They did a CT Scan and they didn&#39;t find anything. I am waiting to follow up with my doctor since I am still throwing up.

                                                March 23 about 7pm I started with stomach upset, then had body aches and then had a migraine start about 10pm.   Went to the ER the next day to be treated for the stomach upset and migraine. Found out I had a fever of 101 degrees. Was treated with a few medications. Migraine subsided a little bit and then I was sent home. It is now almost 48 hours post-covid vaccine and I still have a headache.

My husband was monitoring me, laid down and elevated my legs above my head, took Benadryl, hydrated, and rested. When I could stand, I took a pure hot shower to warm up. I thought I was going to die. The episode started to lessen about 45 minutes after taking Benadryl and elevating legs. Much better today but still not feeling well.

Because of this, I was getting nauseous and fever spikes. Then about 3:30am, I had water like diarrhea. After that, I started to feel dizzy (I was fine as long as I still) with cold chills along with being very tired.  When I got home, I took some Ibuprofen and took a nap (4 hour nap). Began to feel much better. When I woke up, I felt better but still had a stiffness in my shoulder blade area and left side neck.

About an hour and a half after vaccination I had shortness of breath and chest pain. (went to ER). Had nausea at ER was given medicine. Aprx 8pm had the feeling of something hot and cold being injected into my right wrist that went through my entire body. Called 911. Paramedic stated it was the vaccine running it course and to breath through it. Next day. Little groggy, low grade fever, slight headache and shortness of breath, Saturday morning had another episode of feeling like something was being injected into my wrist. It settled at my chest. Was very painful for about 3-5 minutes. Slept rest of day. Shortness of breath. Woke up Sunday and felt 100% fine.

                                                Moments after the vaccine my arm and hands started tingling and becoming numb in various spots which continued all over my entire face.  I was monitored and was given a shot of benedryl and was sent home after a while.   The next day I felt really groggy, latargic and had diarreah.  That monday the numbness went up to my ear and I reached out to my PCP who prescribed a steroid.   Later that evening I got a really bad headache and the tingling and numbness hit my feet then went up my legs, my arms and up and down my body.  Its a feeling as if my body has fallen asleep.

My arm was so super sore I couldnt lift it over my head.  On 3/10 the headache was still there but I  felt a little better.  But the ringing in my ears has been since day one and the headaches have been off and on as well since then also and on 3/25 I couldnt take it anymore so I went to see my PCP who referred me to an Audiologist but that appointment isnt until 4/29

I felt like that for the rest of the day. I took Tylenol as the clinic recommended. Then after I went to bed later that evening I developed a headache that woke me up around 3:00am. I was very uncomfortable, experienced chills and was sore all over like I had worked out hard. I also experienced joint pain which I don&#39;t normally have. I still feel rough this morning and running a slight fever of 100F. I just wanted to report my side effects.

                                                About 20 minutes after the injection, I had numbness in my lips and cheeks (it felt like pins and needles).  Over the next 10 minutes, I noticed swelling in my throat (swallowing felt somewhat obstructed).  These persisted for an hour or so until I took Benedryl which seemed to ease the numbness but the swollen throat persisted..

Pharmacist had instructed me to wait 15 minutes after injection in case of a reaction, which I did. I felt fine when I left the store and got into my car, but while driving home, I began to have the symptoms described above. I pulled into a hospital ER parking lot and stayed in or near my car until the symptoms subsided. I called my GP and talked to a nurse, who said if I could breathe and swallow, I was safe to go home. I did not enter the hospital ER or seek medical treatment because the symptoms did not get worse. After returning home and waiting about another hour, facial numbness completely subsided.

The next day, sysmptoms worsened, with a fever of 101, and increased pain in my arm. It is now April 9, 2021 and my fever is gone but my arm feel numb and I have swelling in my arm pit by lymph nodes and painful to touch. I feel like my vaccine arm is not as responsive and slow. I feel tired, short of breath when I walk which keep me from my usual workout routine.  I work out three times a week and before the vaccine, considered myself to be in very good health. I did have Covid 12/31/20 and my symptoms were far more mild than what I experienced taking this vaccine.

                                                I got the COVID-19 vaccine on Saturday (janssen). I just wanted to let you know that I experience mid back pain after the covid vaccine was administer on my left arm. it felt like a sharp pain but only in my mid back area. by the evening i got chills and also a fever which i took tylenol, i felt nauseous, my head felt like it was not attached to my body, i havent sleep anything in 2 days. I had a severe migraine and also vomiting but most of all is the spinning of y head like when people have vertigo. I havent been able to eat food because it comes out both ways, either i vomit or constant diarrhea. i made a call to my doctor waiting for her response. this symptos started around 6pm on 03/06/21 and still until today 03/08/21

Chills and fever intensified, and fever rose to 103  by 10pm, with headache and body aches (mainly legs). I had very mild nausea &amp; loss of appetite.

Throughout the next day, Sunday, my fever subsided gradually, significant fatigue persisted as did loss of appetite. By Monday, I was left feeling mostly weak and worn out, but on the road to recovery. By Tuesday morning (now), I feel that the I will be recovered by tomorrow.

Arm was sore but no more than any other vaccine. close to 4 hours later, headache started, felt hot and cold. Hard to sleep, sweating a lot during the night. Headache was so bad it felt like a combination of a bad flu with a hangover. felt very thirty. In the morning I was dizzy, hot, cold, temp 99.8, sick to my stomach, coudn&#39;t taste food very well, just like when you have the flu, nothing taste good. I spend the following day in and out of sleep, very tired, hard to focus. The sensation for being hot and cold continued. Took Imitrex to alleviate the headache/migraine . I did help, but not much. Hard to eat due to an upset stomach. Today is the first full day. I hope I&#39;m better tomorrow

Shakin lasted for over 2hrs at which point I took 2 Tylenols. After 20min the shaking decreased. The shaking came back about 1.5hrs later. At that point I took 2 ibuprofens. The shaking went away. The entire following day had mild fever. have been tired physically for a week now after receiving the vaccine. Lost sense of smell and taste on the 3rd day after vaccination. It has since slowly improved. Botox injection sites (received Botox injection for migraine on March 4, 2 days before the J&amp;J vaccine) are still slightly red a week after the vaccine. My facial skin is breaking out also. Vaginal yeast infection started 4 days after receiving the vaccination. I feel slower than usual in my thinking processes since the vaccination.

By the second or third day post-vaccine I developed hives on the back of my neck and shoulders and cold sores on my mouth and nose and continued to have a headache.  I was seen by my doctor on March 12th and was told that I had a sinus infection.  I was prescribed 100 mg Doxycycline Hyclate and began seeing improvements within 36 hours to the sinus infection.  The hives are still clearing up and were not treated.

I couldn&#39;t stay awake for more than about 15 minutes at a time.   Medication taken was 400mg Aleve (Naproxen Sodium). Fever lasted through the night.  As of today (3/16/21) all other symptoms except nausea persist.  Headache comes and goes.  I can stay awake for longer periods of time, but if I get up for anything for any more than a few minutes, I feel weak and dizzy again.

All over body aches, no appetite, weakness, fatigue, headache, nasal congestion, burning eyes, ataxia, lightheadedness. Took my AM meds including hydrocodone-APAP which caused the fever to break but stayed low grade until the following afternoon around 2 PM. Helped with the body aches somewhat as well. Appetite started to return this morning, 3 days after the vaccine but the fatigue, weakness, muscular pain and a general unwell feeling continues.

When I got out of bed I was lightheaded and passed out in the bathroom as I was getting Tylenol.  I took 2 Tylenol and had diarrhea about 10 mins later.  I went to get some gatorade and passed out again in the hallway on the way to the kitchen.  About an hour after taking Tylenol symptoms began to improve but became nauseous and couldn&#39;t get back to sleep.  As of 2pm Sunday current symptoms are extreme nausea and extreme exhaustion.

                                                Approximately a half hour after the Janssen vaccine was administered on Monday, March 15, 2021 at 2:00pm, I felt a dull ache/sensation in the back, lower part of my head. No other symptoms that day. Today is Tuesday,  March 23 and I am still experiencing side effects from the vaccine. The side effects, other than the &#34;brain ache&#34; come and go. The side effects include what I can describe as a &#34;brain&#34; ache, some itching (3/16), random sweating, arms feeling like dead weight, overall general feeling sick, random body aches (don&#39;t last long), dragging of feet when walking, noises being louder than what they actually are, brain &#34;fog&#34;, dizziness, nausea, tingling in legs and feet .  What I describe as a &#34;brain ache is a different feeling than a headache or migraine.  It is as if my brain actually hurts. A very notable side effect that occurred on  Wednesday, March 17, was an episode of Alice in Wonderland Syndrome. Throughout my life I have experienced AIWS  at bedtime.  On Wednesday, I experienced an episode during the day and it lasted for three hours.  My session is going to log me out.  I cannot type anymore.  Please contact me for more inforamtion.

A few hours later, I had a fever of 100.5 and an elevated resting heart rate (100-105 bpm while normal is 68-70 bpm). I then developed a massive headache in my entire head/face. I waited until 24 hours after the vaccine to take 2 Tylenol. I showed much improvement 2 hours after that. I took 2 more Tylenol about 6 hours later and went to bed. I slept well and woke up completely fine the next day.

After the majority of the body aches subsided, I ended up with facial pain from my temples all the was into my neck. This pain occurred on both sides of my face and was so bad that I couldn?t lay on my side with the side of my head on the pillow. The pain felt like severe joint pain, but also felt like it was in my glands. It felt like my salivary glands wanted to burst.  I used CBD cream topically to try to help with the pain, also CBD tincture internally. Finally resorted to Acetaminophen 1000mg. The acetaminophen seemed to help the tiniest bit. Then my fever broke. Once I began sweating I could feel the pain in my face almost melting away.  This lasted about three hours. When I woke up at 8:00AM the side effects seemed to have all subsided. I still had a very mild headache.

At 2 pm I started feeling warm, not feverish. 12 hours after the shot I started feeling achy and cold. When I woke up on March 25th, I was achy, with chills and internal heat, no fever though. Basically every muscle hurt and I really couldn&#39;t move.  I spent the entire day in bed unable to eat or even move. I had to take the day off from work.   I think I had Covid in Feb 2020 before testing began. The symptoms I felt in February 2020 were exactly the same beginning 12 hours after the vaccine.

                                                I received the J&amp;J shot in the arm at 12:30 PM on 4/6.  At 7:00 PM -I started experiencing severe muscle cramping in both arms and both legs.  By 9:00 PM  chills started and were added to the severe muscle cramping experienced earlier. I took one Ibuprofen pill at 10:00 PM and tried going to sleep.  I was up all night with insomnia and muscular pain.  I had a low grade temperature of 100.3 starting around 12:30 AM.  Today, 4/7 I&#39;ve had low grade temperature around 99 and severe muscle cramping in both legs early morning.  Right now at 4:30 PM on 4/7, my temp is gone but I remain extremely fatigued and have muscle cramping in both legs.  I tried taking a nap today and failed to sleep. The last time I was able to sleep was Monday night 4/5. I am hoping this will resolve itself by tomorrow 4/8.  If symptoms don&#39;t resolve by 4/8 I will contact my PCP on 4/9. Thank you hope this information helps. I didn&#39;t expect to have insomnia as a symptom of this vaccine.

                                                I was held for approx 30 minutes. Drove out and when driving home started to get short of breath, so turned towards the hospital rather than home and called them. My significant other also had his shot, so we switched spots driving at that time. I called the hospital on my way when I started to feel my throat start to close at exactly 1829 on my phone (6:29 pm.). Appointment was at 6pm for shot. Hospital was 13 minutes away. Half way there my tongue started to swell and my lips slightly with tingle. My breathing was more labored to keep up effort as I could not expand my lungs to capacity. I was always able to breath and speak, my voice did become more raspy.    Upon ER, Blood Pressure was very Hypertensive around 140s/120s with my respiratory effort to get in. Pulse was stable around 70-80. O2 was 97-99.  I was able to lay down and relax my breathing which relaxed my blood pressure to 140s/ 80s. I was given IV Benadryl, IV Dexadron, PO Pepcid with a liter of fluid. Monitor up until after 8pm when I was released with still mild tonge swelling but breathing ok. Continue Benadryl at home with my Epi pen for bees stings available.    Did go to work today 07/08/2021. Was wheezy, SOB, no throat swelling, tongue swelling at base. Kept up with Benadryl. Made it 1/2 day and went home. Walking and movement makes increase lung workload. My staff concerned with effort and flush skin while getting supplies. But flush and redness does subside some with rest. When talking need to take a break to breath. But can today notice when Benadryl kicks in. No history of Asthma ever or breathing issues ever. Very active on my farm and at work.

                                                Bell&#39;s palsy symptoms within an hour after receiving vaccine injection:  consisted of right-sided facial numbness, right-sided eyelid droop, right-sided mouth turn, right-sided tightness in neck muscle, pressure behind right eye, headache, loss of balance, difficulty speaking.  The injection was at 3:15 pm and started with arm soreness and stinging, a slight headache, and some tingling in my right hand while waiting 15 minutes after the shot, I had also felt a sensation going up the right side of the back of my neck almost immediately after the injection.  The Bell&#39;s palsy symptoms started by 4:00 pm.  I had a low-grade temp that evening of 99.9.  I emailed my neurologist who I see for migraines, of my symptoms.  The following morning on 03-10-2021 I woke with a severe migraine, fullness in my right ear, more pressure behind my right eye and it is watery, with new ringing in both ears, louder in the right ear.   Still residual numbness and drooping of right side of face and eye, tightness in right side neck muscle in front, and speaking better.   Woke up on Thursday morning 03-11-2021 with flu symptoms and migraine gone.  Eye pressure still there and now having significant pain moving my eye and now more feeling of fullness in my right ear.  Eye pain was concerning.  Dr advised me at this time if symptoms have continued or gotten worse to go to the emergency room.   Today, Saturday 03-13-2021, I am still experiencing moderate eye pain behind/above my right eye with pressure.  I am continuing to treat the pain with oxycodone prescribed by ER Physician.

                                                Patient has prior allergies to other medications, never had to use epinephrine. Past allergies include: Percocet, tramadol, Toradol and latex tape. Patient stated she has some full budding numbing experience but no anaphylaxis. We gave her the J&amp;J covid 19 vaccine and asked her to wait 30 minutes to be monitored due to her past allergies. Around 20 minutes patient let one of the pharmacist know she was feeling very flushed and dizzy. We brought her over to the side to be monitored more closely. We had patient elevate her feet to help with faint feeling and drink some water.  Within 5 to 10 minutes her symptoms  started worsening. Tingling sensation started going up her side of head and neck. It started moving to the front of her face. Once that happened I asked how her breathing was and she was starting to get short of breath. Soon after patients throat started to close. We administer 0.3 m of epinephrine and called 911. Pt was able to breathe a little better but within 5 minutes she was back to gasping for air, we administered another 0.3 mg of epinephrine and the paramedics arrived.

Day 7-present Knot harder and maybe bigger. And the tingle in the arm and fingers  is back. I&#39;ve done some  research and this is not mentioned anywhere. Especially at 12 days. Nor anyone i know with this symptom. I thought it was worth mentioning. Will call doctor if arm tingle doesn&#39;t go away by early next week.

                                                So after I got the shot I had a sore arm for 4 days and when I mean sore I mean pretty sore, if I lifted something it would hurt. It was more sore than the normal for a shot. On Sunday the 14th I woke up with a fever (103F) shortness of breath and a headache, on Mondya the fever was a little lower in the 100s and I still have the shortness of breath. The next day I only had the fever and the whole week I just had a low grade fever (in the 99s) and on Saturday I woke up with high fever again and decided to go get a covid test. My fever broke when I was at the covid test site (Urgent Care) but at night it was back again. My test was negative. I noticed that every time I had high fever, 100s I had shortness of breath - the fever lasted 14 days (low grade for most part). Monday 03/29/2021 at 1:15 I have an appt with my PCP.

                                                Woke up with discomfort/pain in my breastbone area.  It spread to my esophageal tube (extremely tender), a couple hours later my throat became strep-like sore, could not take a full breath, and throat swelling impacted my ability to talk clearly.  About 12 hours later, I had facial swelling.  One full day later, a chain-like rash appeared on my arms, chest, thighs, and feet.  Each subsequent day is spread to a new body part (but never occurred on my face),  I had to take Benadryl EVERY 4-5 hours to keep everything at bay.  Three days into the event my neck and torso skin were extremely painful to touch.  Most days since, I am exhausted and get winded easily.  Today is 30MAR21 and it&#39;s happening again as it began on 21MAR21.  I took two Benadryl in the hopes I will not have to go to ER again.

                                                The patient received a Janssen COVID vaccine on 4/8/21 at around 5:00 pm.  The patient was nervous during the administration and reported never receiving a flu vaccine in the past.  The common side and serious side effects were discussed with the patient.  The vaccine was administered to the patient without issue.  The patient and husband instructed to wait 15 minutes after the administration of the vaccine as is the recommendation per the CDC.  About 5 minutes after the administration of the vaccine, the patient&#39;s husband notified the pharmacy staff that his wife was not felling well.  Pharmacist responded to the patient.  The patient reported shortness of breath and feeling hot and stated she was about to pass out.  Pharmacist was instructed to retrieve the Epi-Pen from the immunization cart and assist.  Code White was called and Division 1 staff responded and assisted.  The patient was lowered to the ground and her feet were elevated.  It was at this point that it was determined that the patient was not experiencing anaphylaxis based on the symptoms she was reporting and exhibiting.  The patient was instructed to remove mask to help obtain better breaths and remove the patient from hyperventilation.  An icepack was obtained and placed on the patients neck once she was able to sit up.  The patient&#39;s symptoms improved to the point of moving to a chair.  The patient sipped water and continued deep breathing.  The patient&#39;s symptoms continued to improve and she was able to leave.

Shortly after sitting down for observation she began to feel extremely dizzy.  observed her condition and immediately attended to her. Fanning her to give her air and allowing her to lay her head back. informed of the need for someone to assist. After 15 minutes of the woman still not feeling better we decided to call for paramedics.  Paramedics arrived in 10 minute took vitals. Glucose 132. O2 sat 100%. BP 120/80.  Vitals were all good but patient still extremely nauseous and dizzy. Emt&#39;s administered oxygen and ice pack to neck. Woman began to become more alert and was responding better to questions. Due to her positive vitals the emts felt comfortable about leaving her after 15 minutes of oxygen treatment. Her husband and son walked her out.

                                                Started with chills.  I was freezing for almost three hours. I could not get warm-with tons of blankets, heater, heat cranked up. Then I was seating. I had a fever and am still fighting this fever.  It was at 103 on Sat.  It was 101 this morning. I feel fluish-body aches, headache, eye sockets hurt, exhausted.   On sat, after the chills, my legs hurt and felt like they were 100 pounds.

Fever dropped from 104.3 to 102.5 immediately before taking patient to emergency department, so did not transport. Continued dropping so no further treatment sought. By following morning temperature returned to normal.

                                                Minor headache, moderate nausea, dizziness occurred the evening of the injection.  Those symptoms continue the following day, along with vomiting and fatigue.  Vomiting occurred late in the evening after bending over to clean up cat vomit, which always sets off my gag reflex, but I was feeling like I could vomit before that anyway.  Also, I had just started taking Hydrochorothyozide the day of the injection and some of the things I experienced can be side effects of the medicine as well.

                                                About 5 or 6 hours after the shot , I developed body aches and chills and had a fever of 101. This lasted through the night, along with a sharp pain in my chest that developed in the night and radiated from front to back, which made it difficult to sleep. During the night, I took some rolaids and moved the couch to sleep more upright, because I think the pain may have been heartburn or some other GI thing (I rarely get this feeling, but I have had it before, and my last meal of the day was several hours before i went to bed and before my symptoms started). By morning the next day (Sunday), my whole left arm was achy, down to my hand and fingers, and my right arm also but not as severe. My left armpit felt tender (and still does today, but not as bad).  By mid-day, I started to feel better, the fever was gone, and by late afternoon, the body aches were gone. My left arm and hand was still tender, but not as bad. By Sunday night i would say I was back to about 80%, and by Monday morning, 95%, and by late Monday morning, back to normal, other than the slight tenderness I still feel (today being Tuesday) in my left armpit.

By that evening I felt much better with just a headache and by the following day all symptoms subsided    I had hardly any Odin at the injection site unless I pushed or laid on it and no swelling or rash at all.

Up all night in extreme pain and with fever weakness body aches internal pain, migraine. took some oxy and ibuprofen in the early evening when pain got too bad to bear around I think 7pm. That helped, fever went down to 99, then the meds wore off chills and pain returned. Started taking oxy and ibuprofen every hour on the hour from 2am until 2pm following day when I was then able to sort of sleep for 2 hours. Stopped taking meds. Took NAC to protect against all that ibuprofen. Took warm bath with bathsalts. Still feel sick but head pain and muscle aches have receeded.

When she walked, it traveled up to her thighs.  When she sat down, it went back to her lower extremities (from knees to feet).   She drank water and gatorade, but this didn&#39;t help the situation.  Patient was also anxious and feeling lightheadedness, but she&#39;s feeling better.  She&#39;s not having difficulty breathing or any other symptoms.   Oxygen saturation is at 99.

Had an odd white noise in my ears - not &#34;ringing&#34; but buzzing kind of sound. Lasted for about 3-5 minutes and I ended up lying on the floor for about 15 minutes before I could get back up. Felt like I may blackout. It&#39;s three hours later and I&#39;m ok now.

In the ER they gave me numerous medications and nothing worked, I was there for about 5 hours before they discharged me. When I got  home I went straight to sleep and when I woke up in the morning I was feeling better.

I went in to see my PCP and he checked me and only thing he came up with  due to my auto immune disease it triggered inflammation.  I&#39;m still in pain everywhere and can&#39;t touch certain parts of my body, my Dr. can&#39;t figure out where it&#39;s from and believes it&#39;s from the shot. If it&#39;s not better in a week he wants me to go back.

                                                I had the shot on weds afternoon. On Thursday I felt ill with flu-like symptoms, mainly body aches and headache. These symptoms were gone by Friday and I felt great. I woke up Saturday morning at 4:30am and needed to use the bathroom/, which is about 10 steps from my bed. As I entered the bathroom I completely blacked out, causing me to fall and break my ribs. This has never happened to me, and there was nothing else wrong with me (I spent 2 days in the hospital checking heart, brain, inner ear, etc). In addition to the 4:30am blackout, it also happened again several hours later at 11am, saturday morning. This time I again got so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stay on my feet, and while my husband was right there lowering me to the floor I was in a daze, a cold sweat, and absolutely no control over it.

I started breaking out in hives , coughing and trying to clear my throat.  I was taken to the medical area and given a dose of liquid Benadryl.  Within 20 minutes it was easier to breathe and my blood pressure and pulse ox returned to normal.  About 3 hours later I started to get itchy again around my throat and ears.  Per the guidance of the nurse at the vaccine site, I took 2 - 25mg Benadryl tablets.  By the next morning I felt better.

                                                The night of my injection I woke up with extreme left arm and scapular pain.  It radiated down to my fingers.  It all was heavy and number and tingling.  That continued most of the day.  The next day I was extremely fatigued and weak and stayed in bed.  I think had left ear and lymph node pain on the left side of my face and neck.  This continued for days.  By the 1 week mark after my injection, I ended up at the urgent care with facial swelling and extreme lymph node pain.  They stated it was an adverse reaction to the vaccine.  As of yesterday, I continue to have some swelling in my jaw and occipital region as noted by the PTA where I go for physical therapy.  I continue to experience extreme fatigue, worse than normal and dizziness.  My left pinky still has some tingling and vibration feeling.  I also still get cramping on this finger and on the ulnar side of my palm.

Was able to roll down my window and honk horn for emt in parking lot before fainting. Woke up to emt checking blood pressure, pulse and putting oxygen mask on. Then had to throw up, continue oxygen, sat and waited about 45 minutes until I felt like I could safely drive home.  Had mild flu like symptoms starting about 3 hours later, became more moderate symptoms about 8 hours after injection - headache, fatigue, fever, body aches, nausea. Slept all next day, only remained.

                                                At 12 hours through 16 hours after administration of the vaccine I experienced rigorous shivers, feeling freezing cold to the bone for hours and couldn&#39;t get warm (even with piles of blankets), periodic heart pain and some chest pressure, periodic knife like stabbing pain in my right knee, mild nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, severe weakness, sometimes a cough.  At 16 hours I got up to get water and had to hold onto things to keep my balance. After drinking a couple of cups of water, I turned away from the bathroom sink and lost consciousness, fainting and falling onto my bathroom floor. The jolt of the fall woke me up and it took a lot of strength to get up. The symptoms were vicious. When I fainted, the brunt of my weight must of been on my upper left rib cage. My ribs were so sore for a week. It was difficult to walk, breath, blow my nose, or cough.  My health provider recommended a Tylenol regime for pain control so that I could take deep breaths and prevent pneumonia. I had a low grade fever of 99 degrees F for one to two days following the vaccine. During the week that followed I felt periodically very ill, had a constant headache for a day or two, and had extremely foggy thinking and sometimes confusion.  I was very fatigued all week long. I lost my appetite and have still not gained my typical appetite back. Day 8 to 9 is when I was finally feeling closer to normal. Today I feel I may be back to 100%, but my rib cage is still healing, either from a contusion, fracture, or break (likely a contusion).

                                                10 days after the vaccine I developed dizziness, tachycardia, dry mouth,chest pressure, shortness of breath and felt like I was going to pass out, and I had a feeling of extreme doom. I was transported to a clinic. There I had a heart rate of 140 with irregular beats. Continued feeling of doom. An EKG showed ST depression. Symptoms improved with nitroglycerin. The clinic didn&#39;t have the technology to provide care so I was emergently transported again. At that hospital my D-dimer was positive and that lead to a CT Angiogram. This showed a pulmonary embolism. Doppler studies of both legs were negative. I was placed on Heparin for several hours and then switched to Eliquis. About 6 hours after being on Eliquis I had the exact same original symptoms and again nitro was given which helped the symptoms. I was placed back on Heparin for a longer period of time. Once I was anticoagulated I was then switch to Eliquis 10mg BID for 7 days then 5mg BID for 6-9 months. I had a CT Angiogram of the head and neck which was normal. At this time I still have dizziness with standing and intermittently with sitting, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath.

I  had a very weird dream Saturday night and woke up very tired Sunday morning around 8 am. I went back to bed 11:15 am and slept until 1:30.  The dizziness lasted the rest of Sunday.  I have only slept for 5 hours between Sunday night and today (Tuesday March 9th).

By lunchtime, I had chills, fever, nausea, aches and slept the better part of the next 19&#43; hours. Day 2 after my injection, I woke up with a horrible headache. I am still weak but improving each hour.

                                                After the vaccination, I felt a little dizzy waiting in the parking lot and had a sore arm, but felt fine otherwise.  (12:00-1:00 pm)  After returning home, I felt increasingly tired and warm.  I laid down  and took my temperature after walking the dog around 3:00 pm.  My temperature read 99 degrees.   I drank a lot of pedialyte to hydrate.  Throughout the afternoon, I felt sluggish and the glands seemed to swell up on the side of my neck. I also got a headache.   My temperature dropped down to 98.7 before I went to bed, but this morning, my glands under my jawline are a bit more swollen and I still have a slight temperature; 98.9 degrees.  My eyelids are puffy and I feel a little feverish, but it is tolerable.

Emergency Department Attending Attestation Note   See resident/PA/student note for further details of HPI, history, exam, ED course, and diagnoses.   Briefly, this is a 51 y.o. female with PMH reviewed in chart and w/ patient notable for insulin dependent diabetes, depression, prothrombin mutation, migraine, p/w concern for allergic reaction.  Emesis or change in Covid vaccine today.  10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, patient reports feeling thick in her tongue with tingling in her lips.  Patient was given Zertec.  The minutes later, her lips began to swell up and was also noted to have new erythematous rash between her eyes and forehead.  Patient was given 50 mg of Benadryl.  Patient felt like she could not swallow with worsening lip swelling.  She was given EpiPen and 911 was called. No stridors.  No wheezing.  Reports continued tingling and the numbness in her mouth but no lip swelling or tongue swelling.  Denies any difficulty swallowing at this time.  No wheezing.  No abdominal pain or nausea.  No rash at this time.   Of note, patient also notes left-sided facial, arm, and leg numbness starting about 10 minutes prior to arrival to the emergency department.  She reports that she has had recurrent numbness on the left side in the past, which was thought to be due to migraine versus TIA.  She has had extensive work-up and multiple hospitalization for this symptom.  She reports that she is allergic to iodine and gadolinium containing contrast.  Denies any headache at this time though she had a mild headache after receiving the vaccine.  Denies any blurry vision.  Denies any weakness in her bilateral upper and lower extremities.  Assessment and Plan:    Vital signs notable for O2 sat of 96 to 98% on room air without tachypnea.  Patient is mildly hypertensive.  Patient is well-appearing speaking full sentences without any dysarthria.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Extraocular movement intact.  She notes diminished sensation to her left face, left upper extremity, and left lower extremity.  Tongue is midline.  Hearing is intact bilaterally.  No facial droop.  She has 5 out of 5 strength in bilateral upper and lower extremities.  No pronator drift.  Normal gait.  No tongue swelling or lip swelling.  No stridors.  No uvula swelling.  No pharyngeal or erythema.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezing or rhonchi.  Cardiac exam without murmurs rubs or gallops.  Regular rhythm.  No abdominal distention or tenderness on palpation.  No CVA tenderness.   51-year-old female who is presenting to the emergency department with improving lip swelling and numbness in her mouth, raising a concern for anaphylaxis related to her Covid vaccine.  Reassuringly, status post EpiPen, her symptoms are improving.  However, she has new onset left-sided numbness, with without any headache.  She reports that she has had this numbness in the past the last time she had the numbness on the left side was approximately 10 years ago.  Her neurologic exam is only notable for diffuse numbness on her left side including her face.  Differential diagnosis include migraine headache and TIA.  Stroke is possible though less likely given the patient has had the same symptoms in the past with negative work-up.  Will defer code stroke at this time but will emergently consult neurology.  Will get labs including BMP and CBC.  We will continue to monitor her from the anaphylaxis perspective.  We will also give her a dose of steroid.  Prednisone 60 mg by mouth given 12:29 PM  NEUROLOGY CONSULT NOTE  Assessment: Formulation- Diagnosis is guarded. Localization structurally would suggest subcortical (thalamic) or small brain-stem in a sensory territory on the right. Etiologies could be stroke given her vascular risk factors but seems unlikely given there is stereotypy of earlier symptomatology. Demyelinating would be another possibility as well, but again, the stereotype. Seizure unlikely because of the timing of rush from toes to body was minutes and duration of some occasions being days. Complicated migraine possible, has some risk factors, but should be treated as dx of exclusion. She does make complaint of headache, which could support. Some FND elaboration on her anxiety-ridden allergic reaction is also possible, but no objective non-structural signs to support.

Day 2 just some fatigue. On day 3 started experiencing rash/hives and extreme itching all over body, especially throughout the night on 4th night. Took antihistamine which helped alleviate for time being. I?m currently on day 5 and there are still some hives present. I will continue antihistamine if needed.

                                                The day of the vaccine not much trouble, the injection site was a little sore. As the evening came I started feeling the body aches, the chills. The next morning  I had a headache, I had joint pains (elbow, knee and hip). My arm pain was really severe. I could not even sleep on that side of my arm, the pain was excruciating.  I also noticed as I woke up that I also had hives, and it was red and hot and itching, blisters, all over my hand. I then contacted my PCP and they suggested Benadryl capsules. It took about a week for the rash to go away, I finally can wear my ring back (hands were very swollen). Now, I noticed I developed a cough about after a week after the vaccine. The rash is gone off my hands but the skin looks like it is peeling (reminds me of when a person has a real bad sunburn on skin and the burnt skin starts peeling off) from all the blistering and the rash on my hands. I did have COVID in late November, early December. I tested positive on 11/30/2020. The new skin that is being exposed is really tender and sore. I notice with each passing day skin feels better not so sensitive.  I get a little bit better each day, a little more energy each day.

                                                She developed a large pulmonary embolus, and she died on 3/17 at Hospital. She developed symptoms of SOB on 3/11, and was admitted to the hospital. She was initially stable and not requiring oxygen and was sent home on anticoagulation. However she returned the same day with worsening symptoms, troponin now elevated, and ECHO showing signs of right heart strain. Embolus on imaging had increased in just over days from previous CT scan. She became pulseless and died despite resuscitative efforts. It is my opinion (Dr.) that she died of a pulmonary embolus, and an autopsy is pending.

A few hours later, I had a 101 fever, chills, stronger fatigue, strong headache, muscle aches. Around 6pm, I began vomiting continuously. I spoke with an advice nurse and she told me to go to the emergency room. I continued to vomit until about 11:30pm, I was weak and felt like passing out a few times. Later in the evening, I took a Tylenol and finally went to sleep. On April 2nd (day after shot), I woke up with fatigue and headache, but fever was gone and I no longer vomited. I took another Tylenol and headache went away.

Fever stayed near 103 overnight until I took tylenol somewhere between 2-4 am.  By 5 am the fever was down to 101.5.  Fever stayed between 101-102 most of the following day (4/6/2021), dropping to 99.5-100 around  6pm.  Stayed low grade under 100 through the night and was back to normal by the morning of 4/7/2021.  I felt mostly normal on 4/7/2021 aside from severe muscle tightness in gluts, hamstrings, and thighs, with soreness in my lower back (unknown if that is related to the vaccine, but it was not present before 4/7/2021).  Today, 4/8/2021 the muscle tightness &amp; soreness remains but the fever is still gone and I feel otherwise normal.

The next day the sore throat was gone, and body aches got worse. All my joints ache. I felt chilled in spite of outdoor temperature of 79, and a hot bath, blankets and sitting in front of a fire. It was 74 inside the house. I started to get a bit of a headache but it never developed into a full headache. At about 6pm (day 2) I started to get  hot. Anything touching my skin bothered me.   At about 7pm (day 2) I took two Tylenol and the symptoms improved by about  8:30pm.

Fever subsided but extreme fatigue and body aches for two full days following the vaccine.  Two days after the vaccine I began to have sharp intermittent pains in my head and lost my balance and had trouble walking for about two hours.  I took Advil for the fever and the pains in head and this seemed to help with both.  Three days after the vaccine I am feeling less fatigue and body aches have improved.

Once I had them under control by adding a ton of blankets, fell back to sleep. Next woke up approximately 2 hours later with a very bad headache. Got up and took 800mg ibuprofen. Fell back asleep. Woke up later with sweats. Throughout the following day, keep headache under control with more ibuprofen.

Less burning at injection site, fever but less, coughing up some clear glen from lungs....breathing ok though, still fatigued.

I was experiencing headaches all day. The following morning on Sunday I woke up and passed out, I guess my blood pressure dropped and I don?t know why and this is never happened.  Had no appetite since Friday and maybe that?s why but my BP is 120/60 as of 10:08am AFTER I passed out at around 8:30am. I?m now feeling better all of a sudden, can drink coffee and hopefully I?ll get a shower....... oh and my joints are sore, I think whatever could go wrong , did!

This lasted for about two days, the third day I was able to manage it and by the fourth it was ok. I was having a difficult time moving around but kept moving to keep the circulation going.  I spoke with my Physician and they said it was side effects from the vaccine. I spoke to my Pomologists to make sure I was on the correct medication or if it was the vaccine.

I woke at 5:30 the next morning with a fever of 99.9 F, a headache, chills and body aches.  These symptoms continued throughout the day and were alleviated somewhat by tylenol.  I slept a large part of the day and felt better when I woke the next day, Monday.  On Monday I felt mostly normal but still had some body aches including a back ache on my left side.  I also had more injection site pain and a red rash about a half dollar in size that was tender to touch and by night time was itchy.

That eased after about 1/2 hour and I was left with a scratchy, sore throat for rest of the day. The next day it was fine.  The other main side effect was being very tired the night of the injection and later the next day.

                                                Vaccination was 10:30 am.  Around 6:30 pm, my right knee started to throb.  I took an epsom salt bath, where my upper back started to hurt.  I went to sleep around 8:00.  I woke up around 10 pm unable to open my eyes all the way.  I believe they were swollen nearly shut.  I could see a slit of light coming in from outside.  I couldn&#39;t move my left hand at all (left arm is where I received vaccination).  I held it up to the outside light, and it was swollen.  The light coming in from outside hurt my eyes.  I couldn&#39;t see enough to call for help.  Around 1:30 a.m., the swelling went down enough for me to open my eyes.  I have never seen them look so bloodshot.  It was scary.  I could move my hand again as well.  I spent next day in bed resting.   Monday, I noticed a small rash on my right shoulder.  I went to work and was there about 20 minutes before I started feeling hot and dizzy.  I went home and spent the day in bed.   I was able to go to work the next day, Tuesday, without problem.  One week after vaccination, the rash on my shoulder went away, but a small rash broke out on my right shin.  This one was deeper.  One week later, there are just a couple of small scabs left in the spot on my shin.  I feel my energy level is close to normal.

Around 4pm the same day I had bad neck pain. And pounding heading, about 1 hour later starting getting chills and fatigued. By 10pm had body aches and muscles pains. I took some Motrin and went to bed. I couldn?t sleep as my mind kept racing. In the morning (day after vaccine) I was feeling worse. All symptoms continued in full force and I couldn?t get out of bed. 10am I was able to drink some Alka seltzer cold medicine and lay back down. I continued to have chills pounding headache bodyaches muscle aches and sweating, but no fever. I felt like I had a bad case of the flu. I?ve continued taking 600 mg Motrin every eight hours and this has helped with the pains and bodyaches. Day 3 woke up feeling much better, noticed a funny smell in my nose, I haven?t been blowing my nose or had any mucus, but I can?t explain the smell. I still have body aches and muscles pains.

She drank some water and then we took her blood pressure. she started to feel better and then felt a tighness in her neck. I retook her blood pressure and it was elevated. She then began having the chills, upon the last reading of blood pressure we call emergency services because it was elevated again. The last time we took her bp before emergency services came the reading was better. Ems checked her vitals and after a while let her decide whether or not she needed to go the hospital. She chose to leave and her son drove her home.

                                                I had all of the standard expected side affects of chills, fever, muscle aches and headache beginning 10 hours after vaccination.  The headache persisted until Friday however the unlisted side affect of the all body muscle trembling/spasms began on Friday evening 4/2/21 and is still continuing as of 4/5/21 as I write this.  I will not be able to get to speak to my Dr. until Friday 4/9 due to his vacation.  The nurse was not helpful today and suggested I go to a walk-in clinic.

                                                Slight pain and swelling at injection site.  Body ache and slight nausea and exhaustion.  Worth noting that I was so excited about getting the vaccination that I could not sleep the night before.  I blame the exhaustion and later headache on lack of sleep, food, and caffeine.  I went to bed early and took acetaminophen and slept well.  In the morning a shower, coffee and breakfast and more acetaminophen makes me almost as good as new.

Within an hour the pain started radiating throughout my whole body.  The intensity of the pain in all of my muscles and joints was very sharp and intense, like when you throw your back out.  I also ran a low fever, and my pulse became very low.  I  had extreme fatigue and headache for two days.  Arm was sore for a week.

Started with some chills and then at 2:00 a.m. (4/2/21) I had a fever of 103.9, chills, shakes and heavy breathing.   I felt froze to the bone.  Took 2 Tylenol for the fever and it went down to 102.4 for approximately 12 hours.  My feet were very sore for the first 48 hours and hurt to walk on them.    For the next two days, had a fever of 101-102 along with periods of heavy sweating that got worse during the nights.  This lasted for three days/nights.   Since I had the shot one week ago, I have been experiencing the same sore feet and have different aches and pains that appear in my body.   They kind of feel like a muscle ache after a Charlie horse and it happens in my calves, back of the legs and back area throughout the day.   I am experiencing fatigue during the day .  I did not have any nausea  with the vaccine.

                                                Primary concern: Change in tongue taste of food and drink. Janssen-reported side effects of sore arm increased from 4/4-4/7 then subsided. Mild intermittent headache behind forehead began one minute after injection and continued 4/4-4/7. Fatigue onset 4/4 lasting thru 4/6. Then on 4/7 late morning I realized everything I ate and drank tasted differently by approximately 75%. This continued to this date (4/8) although now taste change is approximately 50%.

By 11 hours post, I was shivering uncontrollably and had migraine-like headache.  By 13 hours post I had to shed blankets for the fever and sweating. Even taking ibuprofen the fever was high.  The next day I kept taking pain medication for severe body aches. This morning, second morning post injection, I let the pain meds wear off.  I discovered I still had body aches, occasional stabbing head pain, and tingling down my left arm and into my 3rd and 4th fingers.  Currently, third evening post injection, I?m still aching but everything is noticeably improved. I don?t need pain meds anymore.

Did not sleep well much Friday night due to these symptoms.  Sudden pain in left side of my head about 40 min after the vaccine after I walked to the car and sat down after the 30 min wait. Pain starts as a slow dull ache, increases rather sharply, then goes away quickly. Have this pain several times or so yesterday and today even after taking ibuprofen.   Also pain in my neck with what feels like stress headaches with ibuprofen relieving it.

Took tylenol every 4-6 hours which helped only slightly.  Still felt all the same symptoms by next day as well as nauseous and light headed.  Symptoms started to improve by noon and pretty much resolved by that evening.  Total time of adverse symptoms about 24-28 hours.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  Approximately 7 hours after the shot, my body was in a continuous state of needing to stretch. It is like when you wake up in the morning and need to stretch - a whole body stretch- but this was continuous. Over and over and over, right after each other. It went on for many hours. Also, 40 hours after the shot, I noticed a body rash (it could have been there the previous day but I was in bed all day feeling horrible and didn&#39;t notice). I also have a rash on my sacrum area, and I could barely walk with the pain in my bones in that area. As the morning has progressed, I am feeling better in that area but it is still sore. It has been 40 hours after my vaccine and I am still not 100%. Aside from the horrible headache, chills and flu-like symptoms, these are the other side effects I thought need to be reported.

No treatments yet....but if still bad after this weekend, will seek medical help.  Left eye swelling started at 2pm today, with pain. the eye lid and the area around the left eye are painful and swollen. I have been using hot compresses.  Difficulty catching my breath today durning a morning walk. I have been walking for months on the same path and can hold a conversation, but today, I could barely walk and talk. Once I stopped talking I eventually was able to catch my breath, but we had to walk a much slower pace as well.

                                                While lying in bed, I started to experience severe chills that made my entire body convulse violently, My right arm, for instance, was shaking back and forth about 3 inches. M legs were involved, tensing up and shaking as well. The symptoms resolved in about 15 min. as I focused on relaxed breathing and held a heating pad against my body. The following day, my legs felt very weak (as I would have expected.) I did not seek medical treatment, since the episode had ended.

                                                Client reported that she had the vaccine yesterday around 10:45 am. At the time she felt a little lightheaded and her arm was sore. She went to sleep at 1130pm on the day she received her vaccine. At 4am the following morning, she woke up and her whole body was convulsing--the muscles in her arms and legs were shaking, her hands were balled into fists, and her jaw was clenched. She reported that her husband woke up and asked her if she was ok to which we was able to respond, but cannot remember what she said. She reports that her husband said the episode lasted 3-4 minutes, but that she felt like it lasted an hour. When the episode was over, she was spacey and confused. She did not get out of bed. 10 minutes later, a second episode occurred. This time her left arm and right leg began convulsing, but the rest of her body was unaffected. This episode lasted 2-3 minutes and then ended.

My shot was on Wednesday afternoon and I felt better by Friday morning.

In fact, on the fourth day I still had some weakness and dizziness but was able to function.

Three days after the injections, I came down with flu-like symptoms (achy, brain fog, headache, fatique, chills) This lasted for three days. I started to feel better for a day and then came down with upper respiratory symptoms (sore throat, fatique , stuffy nose, slight cough, brain fog, no energy, loss of appetite)  As of today over two weeks from injection, I&#39;m STILL feeling off.  Symptoms are like having a mild cold with no energy.

                                                3/29/2021- received vaccine around 12:15pm  Within 3 hours, I was extremely &#34;hyper&#34;  My husband noticed that my entire left arm (which received the shot) was a different color than my entire right arm.  I did not sleep at all Monday night. 3/30/2021- felt fine until about 1:00pm when I noticed body aches.  It worsened from then until bedtime.  My hands, feet, and back hurt the worst.  I asked my husband to rub my back, and he gasped when I lifted my shirt.  My entire midback area was covered in a bright red, raised rash with blisters. I took Benadryl and applied betamethasone prescription cream (which I use for poison ivy or bug bites).  My hands also itched, so I used the cream on my hands as well. I was sweating profusely but freezing.  Took my temperature several times but it was never over 98.  I could not sleep well, awake for an hour, asleep for 5 minutes off and on all night. 3/31/2021- I notified my primary care physician of the allergic reaction via the patient portal.  His reply was to take Benadryl, which I was already doing every couple hours.  The itchy back rash remained and more blisters formed.  By the time I finished working, the redness was gone but the blisters remained.  Itching stopped.  Body aches were lessening. 4/1/2021- Rash completely gone, itching completely gone.  Feeling lethargic (possibly due to lack of sleep, but maybe from the vaccine).  One large blister (size of a quarter) and several smaller blisters remain. 4/2/2021- as of now, my left arm is still a bit sore when I raise it over my head.  Main concern is the huge blister that is still on my back.

Probably 30 minutes after I also felt a little dizzy but I also have a chronic condition called vestibular migraine. I was fatigued later in the evening. Had full day on day after vax  because I already had things on my calendar but was dragging by the time I got home. Aches all over especially joints, head and injection site was warm to touch and somewhat swollen. Also started running fever one day after. Highest temp 101.9 . I also started having diarrhea, full on three days after. My taste and smell had been off since having covid in august, but I swear they are since taking vax. Today is Tuesday so I&#39;m now five days in and temps normal today. My body aches are also improved but my head is still a bit achy.

Also when I laid down for the night, I was accutely aware of my heartbeat, which according to my smartwatch was beating at a rate of 71.  The next morning, I still was experiencing chills, and felt achy/stiff/sore muscles - possibly from tensing up and  shivering all night.  Pain at the injection shot also started the morning after the shot.  By bedtime the day after the shot, the symptoms had eased up.  The next morning the symptoms were gone, except for a little residual injection site discomfort.

                                                I woke up the day after my vaccine feeling slightly nauseous and with chills, which I expected. However, by 8:00 am I had a headache equal to the worst migraine I&#39;ve ever had. I laid in bed all day trying not to move as any movement caused intense nausea. At times, I felt that my heart was fluttering or irregular.  I vomited 3 times, but despite having eaten dinner the night before, I seemed to have nothing to throw up. I vomited clear liquid, if anything at all, which had a strong metallic taste. The vomiting was very intense, leaving me sweating and exhausted.  I fell asleep around 8:00 pm, and when my husband woke me at 9:15 to check on me, I could tell that the sharpness and intensity of the headache was gone. I still had a headache, but it was a normal headache. Today, the 10th, I woke up feeling mostly normal, just weak.

                                                Fever, muscle aches, extreme back pain, nausea.  Fever lasted one day;  muscle aches &amp; back pain lasted 3 days.  Nausea lasted 3 days, but indigestion lasted 5 days.  On day two I went for a short walk and it felt like there was a brick on my chest...I could breathe ok, but heavy feeling in my back and chest.   I walked on day 3 with no issues.  I also developed 4-5  hives on my stomach on day three which were gone on day 4. I took tylenol for the fever and aches after talking with the nurse at my doctors office. After speaking with a few female friends who had the same vaccine, they experienced similar side effects, however their husbands who received the same shot had no issues.  I am wondering if the shot is affecting women differently.

On 03/12/2021 @ 14:30 pt started experiencing headache, body ache, fever (103.1F), chills, and nausea. Pt took temp, was 99.1F @15:00 and 103.1F @ 17:00. Pt took vitals @17:30, BP-100/66, HR- 134 bpm. Pt took IBU for fever on 03/12/2021 @ 15:00 and Ondansetron (Zofran) for nausea on 03/12/2021 @ 16:30. Pt takes Diovan(Valsartan)/HCTZ 320/25 mg, Amlodipine (Norvasc) 10 mg, and Vitamin D. Pt is diagnosed with Hypertension and Fibromuscular Dysplasia. Pt has allergies to an injectable migraine medication, but could not name the medication. Since the pt took IBU @ 15:00, and the pt&#39;s temp increased from 99.1F to 103.1F, from 15:00 to 17:00; the pt was advised to immediately seek medical attention at an urgent care (pt did not want to go to the ED) and to not be/go alone. Pt was also advised to take Tylenol instead of IBU in the future. SPI was consulted and Dr. was notified.

On Sunday (2 days later), I awoke covered in a raised, itchy rash all over my body.   It lasted until Tuesday.   On Wednesday, I had severe muscle tightening in both calves, originating in the muscle behind my knees.  It was so painful, I couldn?t stand in one spot for longer than 10-15 seconds.   I had to either sit or walk.  I finally have relief from that pain today (Friday).

Awoke after midnight, 03.16.21 with severe headache; it persisted for about 36 hours. Slight nausea the next day (03.16.21). Slightly elevated temperature two days later (03.17.21).

                                                The day of the vaccine I felt sick in the evening by 6pm. I had a fever of 101.6 and I had chills and body aches. I had a headache coming on. The day after my temperature was 101 in the morning. The headache and and fatigue lasted three days. I got a rash on day four. My ankles were itchy at first. By lunchtime there was a rash across my back. A flat rash that spread up and down my back. It was different in spots like a round shape rash on my shoulder blade. My forearm and right knee also had a rash. The rash was redder and covered more of my body from my thighs up to my shoulder on the back. It was spreading very itchy for three days. I went to the doctor and started taking Allegra which improved the rash but it is still very itchy after 9 days.

The patient was given 25 mg of diphenhydramine at the vaccination event and her hoarseness improved but returned a few minutes later.  She was taken to the Emergency Department for further observation.  In the ED, she was given famotidine, dexamethasone, and 1L of fluids, and her symptoms improved.  She was observed for 2 hours and discharged home with diphenhydramine and cetirizine.

Around 11:00pm, I began to feel nauseous. I wasn&#39;t able to sleep, my heart was racing. By 3:30 am I had vomited at least 5 times. Throughout the day on Monday, I was still very cold, nauseous (without vomiting) and somewhat lightheaded. It is now Tuesday and my stomach is still upset. I have not contacted my physician at this time. I have been treating myself with ginger ale, Pepto Bismol, saltines and rest. I&#39;m not 100%, but feeling much better.

                                                pt experienced headache, nausea, and fever the day after vaccination which was to be expected but she also experienced a rash starting with the vaccinated arm moving across her chest then down the other arm.  She also experienced shortness of breath.  She stated she took benadryl every 2 hours for the rash which controlled it and monitored herself with the shortness of breath.  She also stated that since she was asthmatic if the shortness of breath would have gotten worse she would have gone to the ER (luckily this wasn&#39;t necessary).

                                                Vaccine at 6:30pm on Thursday. Arm was very sore.  Woke up at 7am, tired, arm still very sore.  Took 2 tylenol, went to work, started to get a headache, on top of head, above my eyes. Took 2 more tylenol at about 1pm.  Starting to feel worse, finally left work at 3;30pm.  Went home, had fever about 100 or so.  As the evening went on, I had 102 fever, extreme pains, more so on my legs (especially my bad knee felt even worse), the worse headache I think that I ever had.  Even my breasts were sore.  it hurt just to lay down.  Took 2 more tylenol, felt the same.  Woke up the next morning, less pains, but my bad knee still hurted more than usual, 100 fever, tired, headache much less. Basically, had to lay down all day.  I had no energy.  Arm still very sore.  Sunday, felt much better, slightly more energy, arm still very sore.  Monday, feeling much better, but my arm is still very sore.

                                                Administered vaccine at 12:40pm Pt during administration of vaccine started to pull away but full dose was administered, pt was nervous about the needle. After instructing pt to sit in the post vaccine chair for 15 minutes I noticed visible distress at around 12:50pm. I rushed to her aid and asked her how she was feeling and she reported feeling dizzy. I then helped her out of her chair onto the floor to ensure she would not fall and hit her head - told her to lay supine. I then asked my technician to give me the bp monitor. I then checked her bp and it was below 80/60. I informed her this could be contributing to her dizziness and then asked for consent to help raise her bp. She consented and then I told her I would be lifting her legs in the air to raise her BP. I held her legs in the air for 10 minutes or so and then reassessed her BP and it was 110/48. She started to feel better but reported feeling as if ants were all over her left arm which is where I gave her the vaccine. I assessed once again for angioedema, anaphylaxis, hives, redness, swelling, but didnt see anything. Since the pt was dizzy I did not offer her benadryl liquid but instead offered clairitin. The pt was merely having a panic attack post immunization and said she could swallow tablets and was feeling better. I gave her one clairitn tablet otc. She wanted to sit up so I assisted her to a sitting position while she was on the floor. She sat there for additional ten minutes then moved into a chair and was brought food by her husband because he said she did not have breakfast and thought that could be why she was dizzy. She was not a diabetic so I was not concerned about her BG. She said that this never happened in the past when I reviewed her PCQF form prior to giving her the vaccine. She has had zero history of syncope so this was rare for her. After an additional 10 minutes she had a bp reading of 98/60 and left the store feeling much better

I asked her if she was feeling any better after a couple minutes and she said that she was not, that she felt like she was going to faint.  I proceeded to have the patient lie down on the ground with her feet propped up, this was at about 8:10am. I instructed one of the technicians to call for emergency services/emt; this was at about 8:15am. Ice packs were given to the patient to place around her neck, behind her neck, forehead, by her arm pits and on her stomach. I continued to assess her well-being. She never had any trouble breathing; she did not loose consciousness nor did her lips turn blue. She said she felt less dizzy but that she still did not feel very well. The emt arrived at about 8:30am. They moved the patient onto a stretcher and proceeded to take her to the emergency room.

Help responded and I came out of it, and proceeded to vomit 4-5 times.  Felt weak, dizzy, nauseous.  My mom came to drive me home.  Slept the rest of the morning and had some feeling of tightness in my chest in the late afternoon and evening.  Thursday morning when I woke up, my arm was sore but I felt mostly better (still a bit of tightness in the chest).  Did not seek medical attention at this time - just monitoring symptoms as of Thursday, 4/8/21.

                                                Started with sore arm. During the day following the shot I developed a very low grade fever not going above 99.9. Had severe headache from the left ear to the right ear and going up around my forehead, as if my head was in a vise - all day. Heart was racing all day and night, couldn&#39;t sleep on my side because of it. around 24 hours after the shot I felt chest heaviness, which went away after a few minutes. Face was flushed, and I felt clammy. Went to the bathroom more than normal.  Aches  and joint pain, which weren&#39;t too bad. When I woke up the next day, symptoms were gone, except my arm was still sore and had slight fatigue.

                                                About six minutes after shot, I experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate, became dizzy, faint, and disoriented and experienced a period of complete blindness for 1-2 minutes. Paramedics were sent to my vehicle, they laid me back, took vitals and assured me that eyesight would return, which it did. They monitored me for 30 minutes and gave me a granola bar which I ate. When I was stable, I drove home.

Then as that passed, my throat began to itch and inside my ears became itchy, then after about 5 minutes or so my tongue started to tingle on the front end and felt thicker at the back. After a total of 20 minutes or so after this started I was home and took a Benadryl, which helped, however after a few hours my face started itching, no rash just an itch and it is still itching after 5 days. It seems to be getting better every day.  It was definitely a similar type of reaction I get from raw pitted fruits.

Even the inside of my mouth was freezing.  I then experienced nausea and extreme tiredness.  Then about 8 hours later I was drenched in sweat thru the night and woke today with only a sore arm and slight body aches.

Throughout the morning,  the fatigue increased and I felt flushed in my face, but chilled in my arms and body.  I went home at noon and  found I had developed a fever of 100.9, which eventually increased to 101.3 later that afternoon.  I felt joint pain and general malaise.   Two days after the vaccine, the fever had broken and the joint pain was better. I still have fatigue, but it is improving throughout the day.

                                                6 hours after receiving vaccine, I started to get the chills, then body aches, then very intense shaking to go along with the chills and body aches. I felt terrible and the shivering was uncontrollable. I took one 200 mg of ibuprofen at 9 or 10pm, and another one at 11pm. That seemed to help and I fell asleep. When I awoke in the morning, I had a pounding headache. The headache was debilitating and lasted all day. The headache subsided around 6 pm 10/11/21 after taking a 200 mg ibuprofen. All of the above is unlike anything I have ever experienced, even with a fever or flu. It was misery, and I am a good sport, I didn&#39;t expect to have any side effects. These events came on vicious and strong.

By around 8:45 had a temp of 99.2 aching, chills, and very hot feverish, and then began experiencing fast heart rate and feeling like I was going to pass out or vomit, wave of nausea and broke out in a cold sweat, chest tightness.  I had taken two 500 mg acetaminophen tablets from 8:45 to 9:30 p.m.  My heart rate would not slow down so 911 was called and I was taken the ER.  I was given IV fluids and Toradol.  Blood work was done and EKG showing sinus tachycardia.  After receiving the IV fluids and Toradol, felt better and was released.

After some time I felt like the lower part of my face went numb and it took tremendous effort to move my lips to talk.  At that point, the medical called the ambulance and sent me to ER, where I was under supervision for some time. I was very weak and nauseated. After I was released, I was very weak could not keep the vertical position.  The next day I was very nauseated, with awful tinnitus, lightheadedness, and weakness. Staying vertical for more than 15 minutes brought fainting symptoms.  I was not able to get out of the house to work.  The next day the fainting symptoms disappeared, everything else continued. Too weak to go to work.  I started moving about only on the 4th day after the shot.  During this event, I did not have any fever or muscle ache, no virus0tyle symptoms.

I lay down in the exam room for about 10 minutes, and my pressure went down to 122/80. About 9 hours after the shot, I had joint pain. Twelve hours after the shot, I had shivering chills and fever which lasted through the night. My highest fever was 101.4 the morning after the shot. 48 hours after the shot, the symptoms were gone.

                                                severe chills came on about 9 hours after dose received. Could not sleep, could not get warm, intense shivering. Minor headache and dull aches throughout the body. Had to climb under an electric blanket, comforter and then another blanket on top to get warm and comfortable. As i drifted in and out of sleep through to the morning, I noticed the chills and shivering dissapating and was able to get some sleep. Awake now, still feeling a headache and flu-like aches to the body. Moving very slow. Arm  not really sore at injection site as it was upon receipt of vaccination.

                                                I got the vaccine around 3:45 PM.  I felt completely fine all day until around 10PM that night. I started feeling really cold, then suddenly my whole body started shaking uncontrollably.     I also got a fever (close to 102). I paged my dr to let  her know what was going on.    She told me to take tylenol (and advil a few hours later IF needed).  After taking  2Tylenol, the shaking stopped after a few minutes and the fever went down.   During the night i felt slightly nauseous, but i did not throw up.   I also had some stomach pain.    By the next morning, my temperature was around 99-100 throughout the day, but no more shaking.   I still had some intermittent stomach pain but it wasn&#39;t severe enough to keep me down. I was able to shower, get my kids ready for school and go about my day for the most part.   By later that day, the temperate was normal .  I am getting some headaches now, but it&#39;s been a week since the vaccine and I do periodically get headaches, so i would not say for certain it&#39;s from the vaccine.  I am also still very intermittently getting some stomach pain. I can go for hours with no pain and then some random pains that come and go.

I felt lightheaded and the sharp pain (take my breath away) pain kept happening every few minutes. I stayed for observation for an hour, and started to feel a little better so I walked to my car. I drove to my pharmacist close to my house to ask her what she would recommend, and she said to try Tylenol . The stabbing pain kept happening on and off all day yesterday, causing weakness in my leg. Today I woke up and it has been achy, tingling, burning And somewhat numb.

They increased my Omeprazole dose from 20-40 mg. I have loose stools. They added a nose spray as well.  I had had my allergy shots the same week as I had my vaccine.

Later on she started to have fever, cough, and then headache.  She then went to bed and slept 7-8 hours, all day long.  The swelling stayed for almost a week in her arm.  Then approximately 4-5 days later on 3/21/21 the right side of her face, the lower part of her ear to the lower part of her face started swelling, and her lip was numb.  Fearing she had Bell&#39;s palsy which she had about 10 years ago she went to see her doctor and the doctor said that it was a reaction from the vaccine.  The right side of her face and the swelling is almost gone, but her face is still feeling numb.   Her doctor did not give her anything, and since her swelling was almost gone and was improving he didn&#39;t want to give her anything for it.  He told her to watch it and if it worsens to get back to him, and to report to VAERS.

By 11pm when I went to bed, I felt like I had the coronavirus again. I slept with my night gown, heavy bathrobe, my sheets, comforter and another blanket and I was still freezing and achy. When I woke up the next morning, I was sweating so profusely the it was dripping off of me and getting my gown wet like I had been working out and then got in the sauna. All I did was drink hot tea. I had no appetite or energy.

Flu-like symptoms started around 6pm day of shot and continued for 2 full days. 3 days after shot (Friday 4/2/21) around 2pm, while walking dog, left arm from elbow down to hand and left leg from hip down to foot became numb. As of today, Monday 4/5/2021, left arm and left leg are still about 20 % numb while sitting or standing. Numbness has lessened but same area (left arm from elbow to hand and left leg from hip down to foot) still feels numb. Sensation is like when your leg/arm falls asleep, like a dull achiness.

I woke in the middle of the night in a crying fit because I thought I was going to die I felt soooo bad ! It was worse than any flu Id ever had! My joints hurt, my head wanted to explode , fever of 101.3 , breathing issues , exhaustion, thirsty...this lasted 2 to 3 days. Ive had a couple of days here in beginning of april til now of waking up feeling sick again. It doesnt last all day. Sometimes it just before bedtime. I guess I just feel a bit sick, but that could also be the cancer that ive had since july 2020 that hasnt been treated by a health care system I have?

I woke up with a severe migraine, which isn?t unusual for me, but what is unheard of for me is that my medications aren?t making any difference no matter what I take. So I have an uncontrollable migraine almost to the point of going to the ER. What?s stopping me going is that I do t know what else they can do that I?m not already doing.   2. Low grade fever and chills: not a big deal  3. Severe fatigue to the point that it feels like my brain is ?shutting down?; I feel like I?m passing out. Eventually fave up midday, went back to bed and been sleeping for 8 hours so far   4. Dizziness  5. Extreme nausea - keep thinking I?m going to throw up

This lasted 30-45 minutes.  My blood pressure, oxygen saturation level were being monitored.  I left office at around 12:00 pm feeling better.  I felt off the entire day.  At 6:00pm I started with chills, muscles aches and pains.  At 7:30pm I took a shower and went to bed very fatigued, muscles pain and cramping and chills. I took my daily meds of 125mg of Diamox, and 100 mg of Azathioprine.  At 11:30pm I woke up with a 104 fever, sweating, and a lot of muscle cramping in legs and feet.  My head felt like it was going to explode.  My cerebral fluid pressure was up and felt in head and down spin.  I did not rest well and found it difficult to get comfortable all night.

This lasted for approximately 36 hours.  The evening of the day one day after (March 12), felt symptoms of a minor cold in the nose (itchy, drippy, tangy taste) which moved to chest cold symptoms the following morning (March 13), also minor.  Those symptoms lasted about 24 hours then subsided.

                                                The day I received the shot, my arm got warm and sore.  The soreness traveled to my shoulder and neck.  I got headachey, alternating between hot and cold chills, a little bit of nausea and extreme tiredness.   This continued for the next 5 days which seemed like they were considered mild reactions according to the CDC website.  Most concerning though, is on day 5, (3/14/21) in the evening as I was getting into bed, I started getting a red, extremely itchy rash on both my arms, my lower back and my upper legs, to the point that I could not sleep because it was so itchy and had to take Benedryl.  I have not changed anything in my diet or in the products I use on my body, so I can only attribute this reaction to this vaccine.  I am still a little itchy on my arms today 3/15/21.   I am also still getting the hot and cold chills and still have a little bit of nausea, not bad, but enough to be &#34;off&#34; certain foods.

I took Benadryl and itch is subsiding. I hope this is the end of side effects!

                                                About 30 minutes after receiving COVID-19 vaccine by Janssen, patient reported having an itchy throat and some feeling swollenness in her throat. Pharmacist asked if she could breathe and she confirmed she can. Pharmacist asked if she would like to be administered IM injection or oral version of diphenhydramine and patient requested IM version. Pharmacist administered diphenhydramine 25mg intramuscularly and monitored for response where patient reported feeling better and less swelling and itchiness. Patient requested an additional dose due to incomplete resolution of symptoms and about 2-3 minutes later, pharmacist administered an additional dose of diphenhydramine 25mg intramuscularly. Pt was monitored for about 40 minutes until her spouse came to pick her up. Patient was advised to contact her provider and potentially request and epinephrine pen for on-hand use. Pharmacist found a pharmacy, CVS, that carried the epinephrine pen and informed patient where that was so she could inform her provider where to call in the script. Patient left premises reporting feeling like she could breathe fine and no swelling upon leaving the store. The store also provided patient with a box of diphenhydramine (Benadryl) oral tablets to take with her as well as a bottle of water. Her spouse took her so she would not need to drive after feeling potentially drowsy upon injection of diphenhydramine.

About 30 mins later, my shoulders started to hurt. I woke up around 11:30 and I felt like a Mack truck had hit me. I had a fever, headache and chills. I remained this way for about 3 or 4 days, but improved. Then I started to become very lethargic. Just lifting my arm was a chore. On Monday, I went to see my doctor and he said that I was fine after checking everything, to include my thyroid and liver enzymes. Everything was fine, so my symptoms were attributed to the vaccine. Today, I have no pain, but I am very lethargic.

I took benadryl as soon as I felt tongue swelling , but it did not stop the advancement of more swelling in my tongue. Eventually I got throbbing jaw pain from the pressure of my tongue.

I woke up at 1:30am freezing cold and hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t get out of bed. 45 minutes later I managed to get to the bathroom and took my temp which was 103.2. I took more ibuprofen, the fever subsided to 101. I continued having a fever for 2 days along with body aches and feeling very tired. Felt fully recovered after 4 days.

Around 9:00 pm developed deep, intense body chills that lasted at least 3.5 hours. No fever.  Once the chills were gone, I got an intense headache around the back of my head and in my forehead between my eyebrows.  Difficulty sleeping through these symptoms. Woke up the next day and those symptoms were gone.   Fatigued the next day.  Took a two-hour nap Saturday afternoon and felt normal afterwards.

                                                I am submitting this because I know there has been limited data on the effect of the vaccine on people with autoimmune issues.  I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis March 2020.  Dietary changes have kept my rheumatoid arthritis in check -- not requiring any medication, even ibuprofen -- since May or June 2020.  Within 24 hours of receiving the J&amp;J vaccine, my knees, ankles, hands, wrists, and feet began to hurt.  (I also had a 100 degree fever for 24 hours.)  Unfortunately, 2.5 weeks later, the joint pain persists.  The vaccine clearly triggered a flare up, but I hope that within another 2 weeks, the vaccine will have finishing tweaking my immune system for COVID response and the pain will abate.  I do not know yet if that will be the case.

                                                The patient was screened and was found to have multiple medical allergies but no allergies to any of the components to the Janssen vaccine.  As a precaution, the nurses advised a 30 minute observation.  She received the vaccine without complication and then was being observed and they called me over and the paramedics were also with the patient.  About 17 minutes into observation, the patient started developing chest pressure (4/10), lightheadedness, and nausea.  No shortness of breath, stridor, diaphoresis, back pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, neurologic changes, and any signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis.  She was very anxious.  Further history revealed that the patient had been discharged from the hospital 6 week prior.  She initially went in for an abdominal laproscopic surgery and woke up to having 32 staples closing an abdominal incision.  They had to change from a laproscopic approach to an open abdomen approach due to complications.  She ended up with sepsis and a colostomy and was hospitalized for 2 weeks getting antibiotics.  She lives by herself and was overwhelmed before coming into the clinic for her vaccine.   The paramedics did a 12-lead ECG that showed sinus rhythm.  Vital signs and blood glucose were within normal limits.  The paramedics recommended that she go to the hospital to be checked out but she was very resistant and was tearful because she was traumatized from her previous hospitalization.  After some time, the paramedics convinced her to go to the hospital.  The paramedics hung around the emergency department and then came back once they found out that she was fine.

However, around 7pm, I began having cold chills &amp; feverlike symptoms. I knew there would be side effects, so I wasn&#39;t worried.  Later, around 8:45pm, it was everything I could do to stand up right and all I wanted to do was go to bed with ALOT of blankets on. I felt like I was going to vomit throughout the next several hours. Around 3am, I was throwing up and had diarhea. I had a massive headache as well. I had several rounds of extreme vomiting for the rest of that morning, but they were just dry heaves by then.  My head hurt so bad, I was worried.  I continued to vomit several more times that day and slept on &amp; off

All night and through to the next morning I had a high fever, though I didn?t take my temperature. I was achy all over, had an incredibly horrific headache which strong migraine over the counter pills did not help,  I would go back and forth from shivering to sweating (my body would be drenched in sweat) and just feeling miserable. I slept off and on until about noon. Then all symptoms slowly went away. By about 2:00 I was up and around though tired. By early evening I was perfectly fine.

                                                Day after (Friday) - body, head, stomach aches.... even my gums ached. Exhaustion. Day two - body aches and weakness (no food on Friday) Tired. Day three - Tired after walking the dog, napped and then tightness/ache in chest/lung area which continued throughout the night. I could not lie on my side or it would trigger the ache in my chest. I could breathe deeply but that also triggered the tightness. Day four (Monday) - Chest ache continued. Contacted doctor&#39;s office. Took a Tylenol that seemed to help a little and watching my blood pressure.

Then I started running a fever. I was hot with chills and when I wasn?t under a blanket I was shaking uncontrollably. I took ibuprofen which helped a little. Ended up taking an Ativan to sleep. The next morning I felt like I had the flu. Still feverish with a deep cough. Groggy, lethargic and tired. Took a two hour nap around 4. Starting to feel better but I?m exhausted and very irritable.

                                                I experienced body aches, headache, anxiety in my chest (once), tiredness.  One other thing that happened that may not be related is that my secondary implant eye socket became very sore and swelled up.  It could of been for another reason but the timing was uncanny.  I am feeling fine now and none of my reactions were that troubling.  I have experienced about 3 times a sudden feeling in my  body that made me think I wonder if that was the vaccine but I am feeling great now and all is good.  Thank you so very much for all the research and production of these life saving vaccines.

After 4 hours the fever subsided as quickly as it came on and my heart returned to normal functioning. When the fever subsided I was left with a severe headache for approximately 6 hours. Once the headache subsided I felt lethargic and foggy headed. On the second night (3/14/2021) the fever returned but was only 100.4 degrees. I took an Aleve before going to bed and when I woke up this morning I felt back to normal.

By morning my neck and shoulders were achy as well as my left arm and I was still a little fatigued. By the next day my only symptom was soreness in my upper arm and especially at the injection site.  5 days after the injection I still have soreness at the injection site. I took a few doses of tylenol and rested. My job  has forced a 10 day isolation on me because they said fatigue and achy muscles are signs of COVID-19. So I am getting plenty of rest.

Symptoms remind me of shingles-caused neuralgia which I sometimes experience on left side. Facial tingling, feeling of tightness in muscles, including inner ear are less familiar to me. Symptoms appear to change in degree--slight to more noticeable--as this first day wears on. (Now nearly five hours since vaccine.) I have gone about day as normal, eating and exercising, drinking plenty of water.

                                                At about 23 minutes broke out in a cold sweat. At 26 minutes, became hoarse (always my first symptom of anaphylaxis). Progressed to coughing and feeling a lump in my throat and then tightness in my chest. My blood pressure elevated to 152/100. At that point I self administered epi pen and paramedics called 911. This provided relief but after about 5 to 10 minutes the tightness in my chest and the feeling I couldn?t get a deep breath began to return and the paramedics administered two puffs of an albuteral inhaler and transported me to the hospital. At the ER, they did an EKG, started an IV and administered fluids, prednisone and Benadryl. I was discharged about 90 -120 minutes later with a prescription for 3 days of prednisone (50mg) and instructions to continue to take 25 mg oral Benadryl every 4 hours.  The next morning my face and chest were red and looked like I was sunburned. My face was also swollen.

                                                I got the shot in my left arm and shortly after right above my right eye I could feel a reaction going on. Almost like something effected the muscle, I didn&#39;t say anything and went to the wait room I mentioned it before I left and they said it sounded like a migraine and I went home.  When I raise my face on the right side of my eyebrow area feels like I have spasms. When I got home it moved to my cheek area as well and felt strange.  I got a rash on my right cheek that evening and a super bad headache. I took a Benadryl and went to sleep. I didn&#39;t have a fever.  By the morning the rash was gone, the only thing that bothered me was my eyebrow area ( muscle area) I went to the Dr the following day and she said it sounded like it was my sinuses. Prior to this I was having allergy / sinus issues.

                                                I started experiencing chills and body aches approximately 12 hours after getting the injection.  I took my temperature (it was 99) and an Aleve. After the first 24 hours, my breathing became more shallow, and I had an increased hunger to add to the body aches.  I felt as if I had the flu.   At 36 hours after injection, I started having a head ache that caused me to be dizzy upon standing. I am making this report 46 hours after and I still have a slight headache and some nausea/excess saliva.

                                                Received injection on Sunday. Monday was nauseated and had chest pressure.  Nausea and CP came in waves and occurred about 10 times. Then stopped.   Felt &#34;off&#34; for 4 days.  Felt fine on Friday and through Wed 3/23/21 until 9:10 PM.  Developed visual changes in left peripheral bilat.  Appeared like waves in an arc.  Then began to not be able to breathe.  I had to tell myself to breathe.  Called squad, arrived 9:45pm.  BP 170/110, HR 118. By 10pm, the visual changes disappeared BUT developed chest pressure in same area as the MOnday after the vaccine.  Then became extremely nauseated, almost vomiting.  Nause came in waves for next 6 hours until it calmed down.  Then returned Wed am for several hours, again in waves along with hollow chest feeling and pain. Continued with headache off and on with brain fog the remainder of Wednseday 3/23/21.  Discussed with hospitalist at Hospital and was told to report it to the CDC as likely an adverse effect to the vaccine.  Was still in the 14 day window.     Thank you,  RN, PhD, MSN, MS, BSN

                                                After my vaccine I had tenderness in my right arm at injection site and a sharp pain in my right clavicle bone. The clavicle bone pain slowly went to an ache. But then I noticed my arm was ballooning up a d the injection site was hard. Then, About a week after my COVID vaccine, I experienced leg pain (left) behind my knee and my arm was getting larger and warm to the touch. My first appointment with my doctor was 3/24/2021 at 1215pm. He checked out the areas and ordered a ultrasound Doppler of my left knee. I called the vaccine center as it says on the paper given with the vaccine. I spoke to someone and explained my symptoms. She suggested a ultrasound of my arm as well. I called my primary care doctor who added my arm to the order.

My husband suggested I take Theraflu Nighttime for the pain and to sleep, which I took. Around 4:42 AM, I woke up to use the restroom. I was drenched so I guess I sweated out a fever. Went back to bed. My husband woke me up and suggested I drink some water. I went to the restroom, still feeling out of it, then made my way to a chair where I sat and down and collapsed. According to my husband he tried several times to revive me and finally I began gasp for air. The paramedics arrived and I was taken to Medical Center.

Crushing pain all over body, joints and muscles. Stabbing headache similar to a migraine. Dizziness. Diarrhea for 1 day; abdominal pain for nearly two weeks. Intermittent nausea for nearly two weeks. Felt like I had a fever, although the thermometer said 99.7. The feverish feeling lasted for 3 days. The crushing pain lasted for nearly two weeks. The dizziness was intermittent for two weeks. Got a full-blown migraine headache 4 days after vaccine. Please note: I did NOT take my nightly aspirin dose for 2 days prior to vaccine so as to not affect the immune response. I restarted my nightly dose at 11 PM,  6 hours following the vaccine. Still had all the above-mentioned symptoms.

                                                After my J&amp;J vaccine, my right arm felt hot and was red and I also ended up with an upset stomach, had diarrhea and felt sick to my stomach. I also experienced chills, low grade fever of 99.8 and had swelling to my joints in my fingers and toes. My right arm pain radiated upwards to my neck. These symptoms lasted 12 hours and as of today I still have pain in my neck. Since 03-15-2021, I have been seeing a chiropractor for my neck pain. I see him on a weekly basis. At the chiropractor&#39;s office they apply ice, heat and do a muscle rub help with my neck pain that still is present.

I could not stop shivering, even though the house with much warmer than usual. I had shooting pain all over, especially in my shoulders.  I could not move, or even reach for my water glass,  without extreme pain. It felt like nerve pain, muscle and joint pain. I am very active, strong and healthy.  When I walked to go to bed I was in so much pain that I could not stop moaning and saying Oh my god, oh my god, (that?s not like me ? I have a high tolerance for pain and consider myself stoic) and I was shaking so hard I thought I was going to have a seizure or something. I was very tired and slept through the night. This morning I feel like I have the flu ? headache, body aches, fatigue. Thank you.

                                                Difficulty taking deep breaths, dizziness that felt more like vertigo (the floor and ceiling spinning whenever I stood or sat up), exhausted to the point that I could not sit up without falling asleep.  I slept 14hrs straight for two days after the shot.  Tired after walking down the driveway and back.  Entire body aching with excruciating pain but not the left arm where the shot was taken.  Headaches were bad as well.  No appetite.  The 3rd day afterwards I felt better but still very tired.  The 4th day still tired but better.  Tylenol, caffeinated coffee and lots of water seem to help me get through this.  The fifth day afterward, I am almost 100%  but dealing with running nose and eyes which may not be related to the shot.

I became extremely dizzy, so much so that just moving my head or moving from under my blankets or even talking would create a sensation like zaps or electrical jolts inside my head. By this time, I had about four thick blankets on me. This calmed the chills. If I moved even just my hand outside of the blankets, I would immediately start shivering again. I felt my worst at about 9:00 pm. Slowly got better. Drank a lot of water. Dizziness and chills subsided by about 12 midnight and left me with a headache. Tylenol helped reduce that. Slept the rest of the night. Today from about 9:00 am until currently 5:40 pm, I have had slight muscle aches, fatigue, slept on and off all day. Still a bit dizzy but not too bad.

                                                @ 8pm the same day as I received the vaccine I started to violently jerk all over my body.  Jerking was severe for 25 minutes then went to moderate for another 30 minutes.  Felt like my back was going to break.  Around 2am the next morning I experienced mild nausea for about 10 minutes, had a bad headache for 6 hours and temperature for @ 4hours.  All symptoms resolved @ 5 a.m. of the next morning.

Itching is from torso throughout upper body.  No itching on face or legs.  Itching is worse at nights.  The first night after vaccine I did run fever and headache but those symptoms were gone the next morning.

                                                Two hours after receiving vaccine, I experienced sudden onset extremely painful throat, swollen gooey uvula, followed by hives on face, neck, chest, and underarms, moderately swollen lips and eye areas. I took Benadryl 1/2 hour after onset, eventually resolving hives and face swelling. 25 hours later, I&#39;m still experiencing the painful throat/swollen uvula issue. Appetite is fine, though swallowing is painful. Injection sight became painful 18-20 hours after vaccination.

I had a fever, chills so violent that I made the bed shake - lasted for hours; severe headache that triggered a migraine, exhaustion, and nausea.  It&#39;s 2 days later and I still feel terrible.  My husband gave me a tylenol PM that night and the next day as the headache was a full blown migraine, I took naratriptain.   I still have a slight headache but want to avoid taking additional medicine if possible.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine, I had stinging pain spreading like a wasp sting (to which I am allergic) traveling down my left arm. Within a half hour, sharp muscle cramps took place simultaneously on top of the &#34;wave&#34; of sting like pain. These waves of cramping pain changed in location, but were strongest in my arms and legs. Between these waves, sharp pinching nerve pain happens in specific spots which could be anywhere including scalp and between toes. I had one good day with little pain. Other days are not so bad if I keep ibuprofen consistently in my system. It has been 12 days, and these pains have lessened but not stopped.  The remaining pains are more of the sharp isolated nerve pains.  I have not had any flu like symptoms, and I&#39;ve had very little pain at the injection site.  I have not been able to work much of the 12 days since the shot. I worry that the nerve pain may not go away.

Today, March 22rd, I noticed a red rash on my face (similar to rosacea). My cheeks and ears feel warm to the touch, and I have a mild itch on the entire  area. The rash is more prominent on the right side of the face. This has not happened to me before. I am planning on taking an OTC antiallergic to calm the symptoms.

The following Saturday when I worked out, the headache got so much worse; then on that Tuesday when I was working out on the bike, within 2 minutes the headache got so bad, worse headache I ever had and it came on like thunder. I had to sit down for about 40 minutes. I went to an urgent care and got an injection of Ketorolac (Toradol) and ondansetron (Zofran) and they said the headache would go away in about 20 minutes; it has not; I am managing it with Advil but its constant.

I had the same type of pain as Diverticulitis below the belly button on the left side.  My doctor suggested warm compresses and Tylenol for the pain and that helped a little.  Starting around day nine I have had some Diarrhea for two days so far.

It lasted a minute or so. At 2am on Fri. 3/26 woke up to nausea, SEVERE body aches, Severe headache, weakness. I could barely lift my legs or get up from the commode ,chills, and fever of 100.00. I had started taking Tylenol 500 to 1000 mg  around 6pm on 3/25 and continued every 4 hours. The pain from the body aches was so bad that Tylenol wasn&#39;t helping. My fever stayed in the 100&#39;s with 1000mg of Tylenol. I started seeing symptoms ease up on Saturday 3/27. I no longer had chills and fever but just mild body aches and fatigue.  Had diarrhea on 3/27.

                                                I felt fine immediately after the injection - just a little pain in the arm where I got the injection and when raising my arm. By 6:30 pm I was achy all over and my legs were aching a lot. When I went to bed around 8:00, I hurt all over (achy and flu-like feeling, but no fever). I dozed off and on and about midnight when I woke up, I had a very rapid heartbeat. This went on all night and into the morning. It was hard to get any sleep at all. When I&#39;d get up to go to the bathroom, I was slightly dizzy and unsteady on my feet. After I got up at 6:30 am, the highest my heartrate got was 113, then it finally began going down. I was still hurting all over, felt extremely tired, and now had fever - 99.8. The fever lasted off and on all day and into the next night. I was also very nauseated all day and I felt extremely bloated. I also had a bad headache. When I woke up on Friday, my fever and the headache was gone, but I felt extremely tired and weak and still nauseated. I slept most of the day and I still ached all over, but not as much. My lymph nodes were also swollen. On Friday afternoon, I walked up to the mailbox and I was winded and unsteady. On Saturday, I felt a little better, but was still extremely tired. By Saturday night, all the aches, pains and headache were back and I didn&#39;t sleep well at all. I rested most of Sunday and felt a little better Sunday evening. The aches and pains were going away, but I was still very tired and exhausted. I felt the same way when I woke up on Monday morning. It seemed like the vaccination made the aches and pains I normally had with Fibromyalgia about three times as bad as usual. And I was still very bloated feeling all over. By Monday afternoon the nausea finally went away. By Monday afternoon I was feeling a little better, but still tired. On Tuesday I felt better still and I noticed that I wasn&#39;t bloated as much. It seemed like I was getting back to normal.

I walked over to patient and she was sitting in observation area with her head in between her legs. She stated she felt dizzy with no other symptoms, no difficulty breathing or throat closure. Pt was then moved to the cot so that she can lay and elevate her legs. Pt stated that she has a tremendous fear of needles. This happens more often than not when she gets vaccines or blood drawn.

                                                Prior to receiving her COVID-19 vaccine, the patient was already having symptoms from anxiety/nervousness about the vaccine. Patient was given her injection and within 1-2 minutes, she began feeling dizzy and lightheaded. The vaccine administrator came to me (pharmacist on duty) to notify me that she was not feeling well. I went to go check on her and she stated that she felt as though she was going to faint. I advised her to stay seated, asked if she would like an ice pack and water, and stepped out to get those for her while remaining vigilant (because I wanted to be in the same room as her for observation/safety). I brought her the ice pack, she held it on her chest and head and said it felt nice. After about a minute I stepped out again to ask a technician to get a water for her. When I came back, the patient was still seated but had a blank stare and her mouth was slightly open. I repeated her name out loud and nudged her shoulder several times, however the patient was unresponsive completely. I immediately looked for the red emergency kit in the consultation room but did not see one (I later found out that there was an EpiPen on the table in the room, but I did not see it at the time due to the urgency of the situation). I rushed back into the pharmacy, told the technicians to call 911, and took an EpiPen off the shelf in the pharmacy. I ran back into the room and the patient&#39;s face was very red, her eyes were bulging slightly, and it looked like she was trying to reach her hand up or move it, but was unable to. I injected her with the EpiPen immediately, and within roughly 5 seconds she came back to consciousness and looked at me and said &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34;. EMS arrived extremely fast and was there a few minutes after using the EpiPen. She was then taken by ambulance to the hospital. Patient had a friend, with her at the store who was scheduled to receive the vaccine as well, but after the incident she decided otherwise. Later that evening I gave patient&#39;s friend a phone call to check and see how patient was doing, and to also let her know that patient&#39;s vaccination card was at the pharmacy if she wanted to pick it up. That evening around 6:30-7pm, patient&#39;s husband came to the pharmacy to get her card, he updated us that she was being discharged from the hospital and that she was okay.

Sunday: felt great! lots of energy until during a walk at 3pm started to feel spacey (hands feel weird) and spiked a short term fever. Tired and cold. Monday: tired, bottom of lungs burning like I inhaled campfire smoke for a week straight, stumbling over words. Tues: tired, more burning lungs but sensation moving to mid chest (NOT heartburn), feeling like I needed to cough but nothing in lungs, still tired, still struggling with full sentences, irritable. Weds: felt hot but temp was below normal, lungs burning. Took Covid test (negative), incredibly tired, got the spacey feeling and hands felt weird-lasted 30 mins. Thurs: tired, irritable, left side hurt, started having to clear my throat every 20-30 minutes, cold. Fri: still tired, felt like I needed to cough but didn&#39;t reduce the pressure in chest/burnin/aching. Slept 14 hours. Sat: woke up feeling awful. Short of breath, clearing throat all day. Went to urgent clinic. Lab/chest x-ray and EKG all negative. Dr:&#34;Nothing we can do for you. This vaccine is too  new and you are likely having a reaction. Come see us if it gets worse.&#34; I almost cried. When he had me take 4-6 deep breaths to check my lungs with his stethoscope I almost passed out. Now I&#39;m home stuck on the couch under an electric blanket feeling like crap with no relief in sight. Hoping no one else has this ever.

                                                Received the shot at a drive-thru event and then was directed to park in a lot with an EMT squad on standby to wait in my car case of adverse reaction. Due to a prior reaction to vicodin I was asked to wait 30 minutes. I began reading on my phone, and after 10 minutes passed I noticed I was becoming very short of breath and was having difficulty mentally focusing on what I was reading. As this was not an expected reaction, I decided to wait a bit before honking my horn to request assistance. After 5-7 minutes, the feeling went away and my breathing and concentration returned to normal. I waited an additional 30 minutes just in case, but have been fine for the past 6 hours without even a sore arm. Had anything been in bloom in the surrounding area, I would have presumed rolling down my window allowed me to breathe pollen that triggered my allergies, but it is still too early in the spring for that. Weather was 53 F, sunny and dry.

I took 1 Extra strength Tylenol at 4:00pm but it didn?t seem to help. At 7:00 pm I took 2 ibuprofen, again didn?t seem to help.  Finally fell asleep around  10:30 pm. Woke at 12:00am chills and body aches gone,fatigue,  headache and nausea remained- slightly diminished. Fell asleep and slept through until 7:00am, felt better with a  mild headache , fatigue, and upset stomach through the day(March 14).  Low energy and slight headache remain on March 15th.

                                                After the injection the patient grabbed her arm and when she was asked if she was ok she didn&#39;t respond and seemed slouched down. It didn&#39;t seem like she passed out but she was slouching and not responding. She seemed like she was having convulsion that lasted less than 5 seconds. Then she calmed down and her breathing was fine. I got her to respond to me that she was awake and ok. She responded with head nods. She seemed to come to a little more after a minute and she said she was fine but I wanted to call 911. I called the paramedics. During the wait she seemed to get better, we gave her water and she was slowing starting to move around more. We asked her about any under lying issues or any problems with any vaccine before. She said no to everything. The paramedics came and took all of her vitals and she was cleared that everything was ok. She called her boyfriend and we asked him to come by to help her and give her a ride home and assist. He got here and she still didn&#39;t feel totally better. After a few more minutes I took her blood pressure and it was 87/55 and her pulse was around 60. We called 911 again because she stated she wasn&#39;t feeling well again. The paramedics came back and she had a 89/41 blood pressure with a pulse of 40. They indicated that she may be having a cardiac issue so they took her to the ER.

                                                Patient received Janssen COVID19 vaccine (LOT#1802068) at approximately 12:00 pm on 3/16/21. During the 15 minute observation period, she expressed &#34;I don&#39;t feel good&#34; and endorsed nausea. Shortly thereafter at approximately 12:10 pm, she started to slouch and nearly fainted while sitting in a chair. She did not fall or hit any part of her body. She was easily aroused with a touch on her arm and responded to verbal questions within seconds (less than a minute). She denied trouble breathing or chest pain. She then reported nausea again and was offered a receptacle to vomit in if needed; however, she did not vomit. Patient was encouraged and instructed to sit on the floor to prevent injury in case of fall but she refused stating that she didn&#39;t think she would be able to get back up given her preexisting knee problems. Pharmacy staff offered her water, a fan, and opened windows. Her jacket was removed in order to monitor blood pressure/ pulse, which was not abnormal. Patient did not have any trouble breathing, rash, swelling, abdominal cramps, or mental status changes. She was contacted via phone a few hours later for follow up on the incident, at which time she denied any issues and reported feeling well.

                                                Normal initial stick pain, but immediately intensified and went  down my arm.  I got up and walked back over to my waiting chair and my Husband got up and received his vaccine.    Besides the pain in my left arm,  I started feeling weird tingling sensations and spaced out.  When my Husband sat back down next to me,  my stomach had a burning sensation and I felt slightly nauseated.  Then I felt like I was about to faint.  My Husband and the Staff kept me from falling, The Staff brought ice packs to put on my neck.  They said I turned white and profusely sweat.   I don&#39;t remember all of it, my Husband filled in the blanks.  I started feeling better and we left @4:30.

I got the vaccine at 9am.  around 4pm that afternoon i started feeling sick.  by 7:30pm I was in bed thinking I was going die!   By midnight, I got up and tried to walk to the stairs but i was to weak to walk.  I could not sleep.  I was up for 36 hours!  I was nauseous, dizzy, weak, exhausted.  Every inch of my body had pain!!!  I was tingling all over.  I  had the chills until midnight.  My heart would race and then stop... then race again... I was having difficulty breathing!  I tried standing up but I couldn&#39;t.  I would have driven myself to the emergency room but I couldn&#39;t walk.  by noon the next day, my heart regulated, I was able to breath easier.  I was still exhausted and full of pain and tingling.  Today, I still have some pain, but no tingling.

And then about midweek, I was starting to walk downstairs at work and I had to grab onto rails so I wouldn&#39;t fall - had become so dizzy. I tried to get into my regular doctor -  he was full until April 5. I went into walk-in clinic - I  had to grab onto a board there (dizzy) and they told me to get to ER. My heart was rapid heart beat by time I got to ER. They had to give me wheelchair so I wouldn&#39;t fall over to go into the ER room. Horrible bruising on wrist - because the first IV didn&#39;t take. They gave me a bag of fluids - and gave me Meclizine to help dizziness subside and two Tylenols for headache. I&#39;m taking 3  (per day)- 25 mg chewable HCI Meclizine. If symptoms aren&#39;t as bad I just take a half of one. Still needing the medication because I still have the pressure in the ear comes up and I need to take the Meclizine and Benadryl to get the pressure to go down.

My finger tips on my left arm went numb, same arm where I received the shot.  By the time I got home  I had a headache, so I took some tylenol.   My mouth is dry on and off. They told me to drink water and Gatorade  I slept for about 5 hours. I feel better but I still have a dry mouth.  The next morning my arm was swollen and itchy around the injection. I used an ice pack for the swelling.  About 24 hours later I was sweating on and off and my headache continued. I took another tylenol. And my body muscles were hurting.  I did not see a physician during any of the episodes.  It&#39;s the morning of March 23rd and I feel okay today.

The body aches &amp; low grade fever only lasted for the one day post vaccination.

A headache was felt all day, becoming increasingly painful as the day continued.  It was sharp, intense pain in temples, across the forehead that pounded.  Intense pain behind the eyes for 2 hours before the fever broke. I had not taken any pain or fever reliever all day - wanting to let the vaccine run it&#39;s course, however at 3:30 I took one acetaminophen tablet.  I could not take the headache anymore.  By 4:30 the headache had eased up and the fever was at 100.  By 5:30 the headache was gone, temperature was at 98. I then slept for the entire night.  The next day - no fever or pains/aches, just tired.  I felt like myself by the end of the day.

Then late afternoon on 3/22/21 got skin rash on both arms, took 1 Benadryl, seemed to help/clear a bit.  Next day in afternoon, rash appeared on both upper thighs, lower buttocks, arms; few hours later some clearing of upper thighs/buttocks, but then rash appeared on inner thighs and calves.  Took 2 Benadryl and used hydrocortisone cream on rash.  Nose looked red. Overnight rash spread to ankles and feet.  It feels like rash is moving around my body - other than stomach, upper back and neck.  This morning 03/24, feet have cleared, but still on inner thigh left leg.  Right leg is almost clear.   I have photos if needed.

                                                Patient states had reaction directly after receiving vaccine with primary symptoms of headache and nausea, which was followed by major fatigue. The major fatigue, headache, and major nausea have continued from the date of receipt to today&#39;s date of 3/31/21 (13 days). The primary complaint is edema (swelling) which has made it so her shoes do not fit at this time and has been very discouraging to the patient. She has had similar responses to a Shingrix and Hepatitis A per the patient&#39;s statement as received from another pharmacy, but had recently recovered after months of diuretic (water-pill) therapy and appropriate electrolytes such as potassium.

The headache lasted a solid 24 hours almost to the point of vomiting even while taking 4 tylenol every 4 hours then my stomach was empty so I ate a few crackers, but that next night it was hard to go to sleep.  At night I suddently realized my forehead seemed larger than normal!  It really felt bigger and swollen  so I massaged it and could feel my layers of skin/dermis moving around I beleived it was the serum from the shot from all the prone position I was in for so long laying in bed.  Thankfully the next day all syptoms went away gradually and by the third day I was back to normal....at least I THINK my forehead has returned to normal so far as I can see or feel.
