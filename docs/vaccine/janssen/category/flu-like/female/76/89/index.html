Got up at 8:00 AM feeling exhausted.  Came home from afternoon dentist appointment (cleaning) exhausted with aching joints, bones and a slight temperature.  Went to bed at 6:00 PM and slept til 8:00 AM.  It felt like the same reaction from the flu shots which is why I didn&#39;t want to get vaccinated.  I started taking 1000 mags at 6 :00PM about every hour 7-9000 mg total and felt fine the next morning instead of in bed for 3 days with the flu shot and no Vit. C.  Also,  shortly after the shot, I got a tingling at the indent  in the back of my neck near the hairline which doesn&#39;t quite hurt but I feel the need to press on it.  I can&#39;t tell when it&#39;s going to come or what I&#39;ve done to make it happen.  It&#39;s still happening several times a day.

                                                June 4 onset of diarrhea around 1pm.  Took OTC Kaeopectate to stop diarrhea.  Stools turned to nothing but blood.  Fatigue, abdominal pain, nausea.  Same symptoms as my daughter (she has filed a report).   Saw Dr. at PCP office on Monday, June 7th.  Blood tests requested.  Stool Sample requested.  Awaiting results. Since my daughter and myself both came down with same symptoms within 24 hours of each other we were instructed to complete this form and we have been discussing possibility of food poisoning with our PCPs.  Still have nausea, chills, abdominal pain.  Bloody stools have stopped for me.

                                                My mother reported feeling numbness/tingling in her left fingers/hand on the drive home approximately 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  She wanted to go straight home.  When we got home she reported that the numbness had been felt in her head and tongue and it was a very weird feeling.  She was numb on her entire left side.  It seemed to resolve after a while.  She is still very tired and has a low heart rate, but normal blood oxygenation.  There is no visible swelling or reaction at the vaccine site. She still has some slight numbness on the left side.  She may call the doctor tomorrow if there is still some concern.

It went into both of my breasts but worse on left side of breast. This lasted about three or four days. I went to the doctor on Thursday, the 15th. But now everything is cleared up and I feel good. Yesterday, the 22nd I started feeling myself again. Except, I have a tremor that won&#39;t go away - I had a slight tremor before the vaccine but now after the tremor  it is much worse.

                                                Eleven days after getting the shot, my mother in law was experiencing severe back pain and was not able to get comfortable or sleep at night. Before we could take her to see a doctor, she fell while trying to get out of bed at 7am the next morning. She had trouble getting up and exerted a lot of energy trying on her own. She called for my husband and I to help her get up. I grabbed her around the waist and my husband held her walker for her as support. Upon rising (mostly of her own ability) she was so exhausted that we had her sit on her walker and rest a moment. My husband went to check on her twice over the next 15-20 minutes, but when he returned again she was showing classic stroke signs and EMS was called. They arrived quickly and agreed. She was taken immediately to the ER, where they also agreed that it looked like a stroke. She was admitted as they continued to run tests, but she continued to decline more and more each day at the hospital losing motor skills and ability to speak. She was not able to move her right side at all and the left side was fidgety and had uncontrollably flailing that left her bruises on her arm and leg. She was also excessively sleepy. After loads of testings and images, the MRIs finally showed that the brain stem was extremely inflamed and it was an auto-immune response. By this time, she was already a vegetable in the ICU ward under incubation, IVs and a feeding tube. They continued to run more tests and brought in infectious diseases, but they ultimately said her body was fighting an infection that she did not have. They attempted a hemoglobin treatment with an oncologist to shut down her immune system but never consulted with her renal doctor, even through they were very concerned about renal failure.  She could not complete the treatment and only received 4 out of the 5 doses they wanted to give her because of her kidney counts. They said that the auto-immune attack was very aggressive and they could not shut it down. In the early morning of 4/28/21, they finally contacted her kidney doctor and she was put on dialysis as a last effort to try to save her, but it was too late and all her organs were failing. She passed at 1:56 pm. Patient was homebound during the pandemic and did not leave the house unless she was visiting her doctor&#39;s office. My husband and I have limited contact at our jobs, as we work in small offices, and our children (that also lived with her) were being schooled virtually. There is nothing that I know that could have caused her immune system to go into overdrive, except for the vaccine that was administered less than 2 weeks (which is considered the time frame for vaccine immunity) prior to her symptoms.

Jumped in a hot shower for 15 minutes and that went away.  I thought maybe my blood pressure had dropped too low; had same reaction when first put on too much blood pressure lowering medication.  Or sometimes allergy makes the blood pressure drop. For 24 hours after that I was on the couch or in bed lying down;  brain hurt(BAD headache), stiff neck, a big effort to lift my head off the pillow so I didn&#39;t unless I had to go to the bathroom.  I laid back down asap due to slight nausea.  No appetite. Whites of eyes were uniformly pink, eyes glassy.  3/23  Sore spot  to the touch on left temple just above the eyebrow.

Patient states she has been on the ground in the room for 3 days, she was found covered in feces.  Alert and oriented x4 however intermittently appears confused and has varying history.  She does not know how she got on the ground, however denies fall or syncope.  No significant current complaints.  Slightly tachycardic and febrile, slightly hypertensive, exam without any significant acute findings, no obvious skin source of ulcer or infection, no focal neurological deficits, no pain.  Initiated aggressive fluid hydration and sepsis work-up.  EKG appears normal with no signs of ischemia or arrhythmia.  Labs show slightly elevated troponin, low magnesium, metabolic/lactic acidosis.  VBG relatively normal.  Urine negative for infection chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia, no clinical signs or symptoms to identify source of infection.  Nothing to suggest meningitis at this time.  CT head is negative.  Unclear source of fever however empirically treated with antibiotics and fluids.  Patient remains hemodynamically stable with no hypotension.  She did arrive slightly hypoxic and with increased respiratory rate however clear lung sounds and no indications of heart failure, COPD/asthma.  CT chest without evidence of pulmonary embolism, focal pneumonia, or fluid overload.  Respiratory status possibly related to compensation for metabolic acidosis that is likely due to lack of fluid intake due to being on the ground.  CK is normal and kidney function is normal.  Consulted medicine for admission for further evaluation and treatment.  Cardiology was also consulted for NSTEMI, agrees with current plan.   per H&amp;P 4/28/21:   Altered mental status (R41.82): Etiology is not clear. Patient states she had J&amp;J Covid vaccine about 3 weeks ago. Need to rule out cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Get a CT scan of the brain with contrast. If negative will get CT venogram or MRV and MRI of the head. Neuro checks. Request PT OT and speech therapy evaluation. Check urine drug screen. Check blood alcohol level.    Non-STEMI (non-ST elevated myocardial infarction) (I21.4): Start argatroban drip until cerebral vein sinus thrombosis is excluded then we can switch to heparin drip. Start aspirin and statin. Check fasting lipid panel. Monitor on telemetry. Trend troponin. Request echocardiogram. Cardiology to consult.

Rhabdomyolysis (M62.82): Hydrate and recheck CPK.    Elevated liver enzymes (R74.8): Check hepatitis panel. Monitor levels.    Fever (R50.9): No clear source of infection. Follow up on blood cultures.   CT chest negative for infectious process. Check CT of the abdomen and pelvis.Start empiric antibiotics: Vancomycin and Zosyn.    Hypomagnesemia (E83.42): Administer magnesium sulfate. Repeat level in the morning.    Diabetes (E11.9): Start sliding scale insulin. Monitor fingersticks. Hypoglycemic protocol.  Check hemoglobin A1c.    Hypertension (I10): Fortunately patient is hemodynamically stable. We will cautiously start metoprolol. Adjust antihypertensives to optimal blood pressure control.

                                                My mom had a stroke on 6/17/2021 and was hospitalized. A week or so before the stroke, my mom lost feeling in the fingers of her right hand and didn?t feel well...but she didn?t feel sick, just not her normal self.  The stroke spidered out over both sides of her brain. Mom is off balance, her mouth droops on the right and that side of her face is numb. The doctors in hospital could see what happened to my mom but were puzzled why because she?s so healthy with no prior issues which would cause a stroke.  We saw mom?s primary care doctor after release from hospital. She was very surprised that mom had a stroke as nothing in blood work, her health or family history would indicate that this would happen. Doctor said it was probably the COVID-19 vaccine.

                                                I was walking in the airport and I just fell for no reason. I went down slow. I was able to get up on my own, but I have no idea what made me fall. I went to my daughter&#39;s house and I was trying to climb the stairs to get to her place, but I couldn&#39;t even bring my leg up to step on the first step. I had to physically pull myself up the stairs by my arms. I felt like I lost my strength. I lost control of my bladder. I went to the doctor to have a urinalysis done and there was not an infection. I also lost my balance and would often have chills. Anytime I would start walking it would feel like I was drunk with how I couldn&#39;t walk straight. I felt fatigued during this time as well. During time that I would try to speak, I would say something in a sentence that had nothing to do with the topic of conversation. I was thinking I may have had a stroke, but when I went to the doctor and had a CT scan, a brain MRI and blood work done, everything came back normal. All of this lasted three weeks and then just all went away. My doctor diagnosed me with post COVID viral illness, but I never had COVID. She said it&#39;s similar to a viral meningitis.

So they schedule it for Saturday but they couldn&#39;t do it because my mom had an upset stomach. They then schedule it for the 24th but they couldn&#39;t do it because her vitamin k and plasma level&#39;s were off. So they gave her vitamin k and plasma in the morning of the 25th and said they could do the angiogram. When she came back to the room her blood pressure was extremely low and she was very bloated. I was told they couldn&#39;t do the procedure because she had blood clots in her leg. And the bloating was due to fluids they gave her to flush out the heparin they gave her. Later that evening she passed away

Saturday 3/20 didn&#39;t feel good that day, Sunday 3/21 around 3am got up to go to the restroom got very light headed and fell/fainted hitting her head on the night stand and falling to the floor. When EMS arrived she was in A-fib. That had never happened before. No known heart problems.

                                                A week following my mothers vaccination, she became increasing fatigued. On day 10 following her vaccination she went to bed and had to be helped to her room, this was unusual. She remained in bed for 19-20 hours a day for three days. I called all of her doctors, all of whom she had just been seen by, routine CT scans performed, blood work done, and visit with her neurologist. Her oncologist suggested we seek a hospice evaluation, even though her CT scans showed that her cancer had only slight growth, nothing to be concerned about. Her primary care office ordered the hospice evaluation and it was performed on Thursday, 3/18. They said ?she may just be having a bad week following her vaccination? and ?lets revisit this the following week?. her condition continued to deteriorate significantly over the next few days, so much that she began sleeping 21?23 hours a day. On the following Tuesday, 3/23, she was admitted into the hospice system. Now, four weeks later, we are in the final weeks of her life. She refuses food and water now, and her nurse says that it won?t be much longer. She went from a relatively healthily, senior woman, with underlying health issues, none of which presented her imminent demise, to dying at home within weeks of receiving her J&amp;J vaccine. I have no idea if he demise is in anyway related to her vaccine, but thought it was important to report her symptoms.
