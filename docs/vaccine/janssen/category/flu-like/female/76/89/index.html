Got up at 8:00 AM feeling exhausted.  Came home from afternoon dentist appointment (cleaning) exhausted with aching joints, bones and a slight temperature.  Went to bed at 6:00 PM and slept til 8:00 AM.  It felt like the same reaction from the flu shots which is why I didn&#39;t want to get vaccinated.  I started taking 1000 mags at 6 :00PM about every hour 7-9000 mg total and felt fine the next morning instead of in bed for 3 days with the flu shot and no Vit. C.  Also,  shortly after the shot, I got a tingling at the indent  in the back of my neck near the hairline which doesn&#39;t quite hurt but I feel the need to press on it.  I can&#39;t tell when it&#39;s going to come or what I&#39;ve done to make it happen.  It&#39;s still happening several times a day.

The patient&#39;s past medical history included pacemaker for nerve block (4-5 years ago), appendectomy (10 years ago), cataract surgery, and concurrent conditions included alcohol user (occasional, not often), and ex-smoker (used to smoke for 30 years (half pack a day), but quit 10 years ago) and bladder cancer growth (7 years ago). The patient experienced drug allergy with opioids (deathly ill, sick to stomach and passes out). The patient was not pregnant at the time of reporting.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805018, expiry: 25-MAY-2021) dose was not reported, 1 total, administered on right arm on 09-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination.

The patient recovered from loss of fine motor control in right arm on 21-MAR-2021, and headache on 2021. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0 This report concerns a 76-year-old female patient who experienced headache and loss fine motor control in right arm, 8 and 12 days after receiving Jansen COVID-19 vaccine respectively. Patient&#39;s medical history included pacemaker insertion, ex-smoker, bladder cancer, and drug allergy with opioids. Eight days after vaccination, the patient had headache. Four days later, the patient lost fine motor control in right arm and was hospitalized for one and a half days. Two CT scans showed no evidence of clot. The patient&#39;s physician commented that the patient might have had small clot that dissolved. The treatment was not reported, and patient was recovered from the events.  Based on the reported information, the causality is considered possible to vaccine for headache and unassessable for the event of loss fine motor control in right arm.

She wanted to go straight home.  When we got home she reported that the numbness had been felt in her head and tongue and it was a very weird feeling.  She was numb on her entire left side.  It seemed to resolve after a while.  She is still very tired and has a low heart rate, but normal blood oxygenation.  There is no visible swelling or reaction at the vaccine site. She still has some slight numbness on the left side.  She may call the doctor tomorrow if there is still some concern.

Jumped in a hot shower for 15 minutes and that went away.  I thought maybe my blood pressure had dropped too low; had same reaction when first put on too much blood pressure lowering medication.  Or sometimes allergy makes the blood pressure drop. For 24 hours after that I was on the couch or in bed lying down;  brain hurt(BAD headache), stiff neck, a big effort to lift my head off the pillow so I didn&#39;t unless I had to go to the bathroom.  I laid back down asap due to slight nausea.  No appetite. Whites of eyes were uniformly pink, eyes glassy.  3/23  Sore spot  to the touch on left temple just above the eyebrow.

Patient states she has been on the ground in the room for 3 days, she was found covered in feces.  Alert and oriented x4 however intermittently appears confused and has varying history.  She does not know how she got on the ground, however denies fall or syncope.  No significant current complaints.  Slightly tachycardic and febrile, slightly hypertensive, exam without any significant acute findings, no obvious skin source of ulcer or infection, no focal neurological deficits, no pain.  Initiated aggressive fluid hydration and sepsis work-up.  EKG appears normal with no signs of ischemia or arrhythmia.  Labs show slightly elevated troponin, low magnesium, metabolic/lactic acidosis.  VBG relatively normal.  Urine negative for infection chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia, no clinical signs or symptoms to identify source of infection.  Nothing to suggest meningitis at this time.  CT head is negative.  Unclear source of fever however empirically treated with antibiotics and fluids.  Patient remains hemodynamically stable with no hypotension.  She did arrive slightly hypoxic and with increased respiratory rate however clear lung sounds and no indications of heart failure, COPD/asthma.  CT chest without evidence of pulmonary embolism, focal pneumonia, or fluid overload.  Respiratory status possibly related to compensation for metabolic acidosis that is likely due to lack of fluid intake due to being on the ground.  CK is normal and kidney function is normal.  Consulted medicine for admission for further evaluation and treatment.  Cardiology was also consulted for NSTEMI, agrees with current plan.   per H&amp;P 4/28/21:   Altered mental status (R41.82): Etiology is not clear.

If negative will get CT venogram or MRV and MRI of the head. Neuro checks. Request PT OT and speech therapy evaluation. Check urine drug screen. Check blood alcohol level.

I went to bed and didn&#39;t feel good, the next day I still didn&#39;t feel good. I got so chilled again and nausea and went back to the ER and say the same Dr. and took my Blood work again and said my blood work was better than the night before. I also had a fever and they told me to take Tylenol and it was just a side effect.  I feel so weak and sick at my stomach still.

Saturday 3/20 didn&#39;t feel good that day, Sunday 3/21 around 3am got up to go to the restroom got very light headed and fell/fainted hitting her head on the night stand and falling to the floor. When EMS arrived she was in A-fib. That had never happened before. No known heart problems.

                                                A week following my mothers vaccination, she became increasing fatigued. On day 10 following her vaccination she went to bed and had to be helped to her room, this was unusual. She remained in bed for 19-20 hours a day for three days. I called all of her doctors, all of whom she had just been seen by, routine CT scans performed, blood work done, and visit with her neurologist. Her oncologist suggested we seek a hospice evaluation, even though her CT scans showed that her cancer had only slight growth, nothing to be concerned about. Her primary care office ordered the hospice evaluation and it was performed on Thursday, 3/18. They said ?she may just be having a bad week following her vaccination? and ?lets revisit this the following week?. her condition continued to deteriorate significantly over the next few days, so much that she began sleeping 21?23 hours a day. On the following Tuesday, 3/23, she was admitted into the hospice system. Now, four weeks later, we are in the final weeks of her life. She refuses food and water now, and her nurse says that it won?t be much longer. She went from a relatively healthily, senior woman, with underlying health issues, none of which presented her imminent demise, to dying at home within weeks of receiving her J&amp;J vaccine. I have no idea if he demise is in anyway related to her vaccine, but thought it was important to report her symptoms.
