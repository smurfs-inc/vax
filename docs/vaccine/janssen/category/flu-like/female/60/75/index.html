                                                Eight hours after the shot, I quickly became very chilled with total body aches and pains and extremely tired.  My mouth became very dry.  This lasted most of the night.  The next morning approaching 24 hours after the shot, the initial side effects were gone but I then had a headache and a bit of nausea.  Again was extremely tired and pretty much rested all day.  All side effects were gone the next day.  I felt no need to call my healthcare provider and did not take any over the counter pain medication.

                                                I had the most peculiar taste in my mouth. It wasn&#39;t entirely a metal taste, but it was strong enough it overwhelmed the taste of everything else for about 6 hours. I could still taste other things, but the primary taste and the one that remained in my mouth was this odd, almost metal taste.  The next day (after the taste was gone)-  it would have been almost 24 hours from the time of the injection - I was hit with a bad headache and body aches like I haven&#39;t had in many years. The body ache was gone the next morning, and the headache lingered another day past that. Today, Tuesday March 9, is the first day I feel like myself again.

                                                The patient received Janssen COVID vaccine on 3/6 to RIGHT deltoid. She has a past medical history significant for LEFT sided breast cancer, treated with lumpectomy and radiation ~5 yrs prior. Remains on Letrozole. 1 day post-vaccine, she developed fevers (tmax 104), chills, malaise. 2 days post-vaccine, the fevers, chills, malaise dissipated but she developed a &#34;rash&#34; to her LEFT breast (same site as prior malignancy). This rash became a widespread erythematous area encompassing her entire breast. Axilla excluded.  No palpable lymphadenopathy. She reports area to be tender and itching. Rash is blanchable. It is somewhat response to OTC antihistamines (Claritin/Benadryl) and OTC hydrocortisone. She has no respiratory distress, lingering fever, or other allergic reactions. She was given a prescription topical steroid (triamcinolone) and will follow up with her in a few days, if she remains stable. If not back to baseline within the week, will obtain breast MRI for further evaluation.

Went to bed and became extremely cold - teeth chattering, chills and fever at 11:30pm - approx. 8 1/2 hours after injection.  After that vomiting, soreness, headache body aches, fever of 100 degrees.  When awaking the next morning, still had fever of 99.8, chills, nausea, headache.  Finally felt like myself by 3pm on Tuesday, March 16.   I am not a chronic complainer.  After receiving my flu shots every year for many years, this was the first reaction I&#39;ve ever had to any immunization - ever.

The discomfort while urinating has returned this morning 3/17 and my primary doctor is sending me for lab work.

                                                Headache and neck stiffness within 15 minutes of vaccine and lasted for a couple days.  The days after vaccine I had extreme tiredness and felt like I had a bad cold with a lot of coughing and shortness of breath.  I was coughing up a lot of mucus.  The cold like symptoms are still ongoing, 2 weeks after the vaccine, but are less extreme.  8 days after the vaccine I started to have pain at the injection site.  My upper hurt if I touched it.  Twelve days after the vaccine my upper arm hurts if I raise my arm and if I shake my inhalers to use them.  This seems like a muscle pain from the injection site to my shoulder.

I felt like I hit a wall. My body just ached. I took some Ibuprofen and continued my shift. I woke up the next day with a headache so bad that I couldn&#39;t lift my head off of the pillow. I took Tylenol and that continued the entire day. I stayed in bed all day. The next night, I woke up in the middle of the night with chills, but no temperature. The following Monday, I still had the chills along with nausea. By Tuesday, I felt normal again.

Her BP was then taken around 4:45 and it was 162/93 at which point EMT arrived and took over.

The headache and nausea lasted 4 days. Headache is milder but still present, especially with head movements. Ringing in ears, moderate tinnitus from the day I got the shot and it still remains.

                                                Approximately, 11 hours after the shot Severe cold chills, so severe my teeth would not stop chattering. I was shaking so hard my body ached from shaking. Goosebumps, a crazy headache.  I thought i was having an anurysm.  Not a normal headache.  Cold sweats so bad you could just about wring out my sheets and clothes. Nausea, some vomiting.  On a scale of 1-10 of these symptoms is was an 11-12.  These symptoms changed as the days went on.  In the moring of the first night.  I was ok.  Woke up with a bad headache, still nauseas and still cold but not like at night tollerable.  About 5PM day 2 it started all over again, just as severe.  Next moring ok.  This pattern kept reapeating for 4 days.  Food now getting repulsive.  No way I  could eat anything.  On day 5 the symptoms continue now throug the day, however the teeth chattering not happeing and the cold chills a bit less severe.  I would say by day 5 on the scale of 1-10 i am now about a 9. This was so horrible for so long.  Every single night i would wake up soaked in my own sweat.  This is still happening 11 days later.  I am still experiencing headaches.  I never have headaches.  I did not go to a Doctor because i figured what are they going to do, i have to ride this out.  Also a strange thing is took my temparture daily and seveal times.  Zero temprature. by day 5 I could not get out of bed for 3 days.  Day 8 things getting better, still cold chills and headaches but not as bad.  Day 9 way better, now getting hungry. Daytime cold chills now gone mostly less headaches.  Oddly headaches and cold chills start about 4-5pm and continue through the night.  In the morning i wake up with a headache still today.

                                                Sensitivity started within four hours of dose. Autistic sensitivities to maximum. Scrambling of all senses including proprioception to the point of not being able to move from standing  or sitting. By hour seven, all sensory inputs were too overwhelming to do anything but shut down and sleep. 911 was not an option because they don&#39;t let you sleep, and ERs are overwhelming already, before maximizing all inputs. 7.5 mg hydrocodone for overwhelming pain and sensitivity, allowed sleep. On waking, sensitivity was lessened, but the pain started, 18 hours after the vaccination. Emotional lability for three days. Average aching of arm and injection site were not above expected levels. &#34;Brain fog&#34; and lack of ability to articulate (another autism symptom) started within that first seven hours, and diminished over next ten days. Not yet gone as of today  Dry mouth; overproduction of thick &#39;chunky&#39; mucus that wouldn&#39;t cough out, treated with guaifenesin, lasted three days. Shortness of breath and cough associated with that mucus also diminished after three days. Not completely gone ten days later.   Excessive thirst, onset two hours after vaccine, lasted two days.   Hyperalert (can&#39;t sleep without drugs), hyperactive despite weakness, and hypervigilant (extreme startle reflexes) lasted three days as well. Sleep was achieved with hydrocodone and THC.  All over body pain, feelings of immune mobilization (coming down with) for two days were not above expected levels.   No fainting or other collapse at time of injection, or later.  Knowing that severe over-stimulation is exacerbated in a medical setting, it was decided not to seek medical support for three days of systemic symptoms that would have easily merited hospitalization.

                                                Shot immediately started stinging.  My upper arm swelled with a hard ridge about 3 inches long and 1 inch wide.  Extremely painful.  Could barely raise my arm and could not sleep on that side or tolerate even soft touch of my entire upper arm.  No other reaction that seemed like an allergic response.  I did get very sick for 2 days with severe flu symptoms and strange shooting pains in random parts of my body.  Enough pain to wake me from a sound sleep.  Bad chills, but no fever. I did. I give my legs seemed swollen for about 3 days.   I got the J&amp;J vaccine on 3-6-21 and my arm is still swollen with a slightly smaller hard and painful ridge at the injection site and it sometimes throbs and itches severely.  Today is 4-2-21.  Starting to wonder if it will ever go away.  I still cannot sleep on that side.  The pain overall is less, but it still throbs and itches periodically throughout the day.

Significant headache presented in front and sides of head (near temples), beginning day 1 after injection, with duration of 4 days. 3. Fatigue presented on day 1 after injection, duration of 4 days. 4. Mental health symptoms after day 1, with duration of 5 days, presenting as feelings of sadness and depressive ideation.   The last symptom (#4) is difficult for me to correlate specifically to the vaccination, as I am a 60 year-old and in my first year in a rigorous doctoral program at a hospital. The negative physical symptoms experienced by the injection could have added an extra layer to the sadness that I reported from the daily app check-ins. I already operate (since fall 2020) in an overwhelmed state (while beginning a difficult academic program via Zoom). Could the physical fatigue and headaches from the vaccine lead to the feelings of sadness? Or were the feelings of sadness a third symptom of the vaccine? I cannot answer, and therefore cannot provide this correlation link with any reliability.  I did speak to my therapist via Zoom, and reached out via email to my general physician (who recommended OTC meds.

                                                7 hours from vaccine, my heart started palpitating and I started feeling sick. I got in my car to go home from a friends house and started severe chills and called Doctor for fear of heart attack. They told me to go to ER. I continued driving home. Chills got worse. I got in shower with heater on and chills persisted. Drank coconut water and heart palpitations resided.  Got in bed and fever spiked to 102 and every bone was inflamed in pain. Nyquil did nothing. After a few hours of severe and unbearable pain I called ER. Headed over to ER at 3:00 a.m. and sat in parking lot. Fever broke at 3:00 a.m. which was hour 14 after vaccine. Other than severe nausea, pain calmed down. Drove home with Tylenol. Took 1,000 mg and finally rested at 4:00 a.m. Woke up at 8:00 a.m. with nausea but pain gone. 24 hours from vaccine, most of the reaction gone. 48 hours out body normal but pain in injection site.

Headache started in the front of my forehead by late evening, and I literally couldn&#39;t even walk up to my bed.  Restless sleeping with all the sweating and chills.  Woke up with headache remaining and feeling very &#34;wiped out&#34; and still light-headed.  No more chills or sweats the next day, but I was weak for about 48 hours.  Honestly - I&#39;m very healthy and getting Covid directly from another person couldn&#39;t have been worse than getting  the vaccine.  :(   And I am even saying that as a 35 year professional Research Scientist.

                                                A few hours after the Thursday afternoon injection, my temp shot up and stayed right around 102, my heart rate was 135- just sitting, and my oxygen level was 93%. I shook uncontrollably the first 10-12 hours, and had chills. Tinnitus. Nothing inproved until the middle of Friday night- I sweated through sheets. Still had fever, high heart rate, and up and down oxygen for 18-20 days. My heart rate (I&#39;m on 2 anti-arrhythmia drugs so my rate is rarely above 65) was still high but better by day 22. Fever is also better but not gone. Exhausted.

I went to work on Tuesday because my work was short staffed but was allowed to go home 3 1/2 hours early.  I took Advil every 4-6 hours on Tuesday and half of Wednesday.  I came straight home and slept until dinner, ate and then went back to bed and slept until midnight, took more Advil and drank a full glass of water, and slept the rest of the night.  Wednesday I felt a bit better, headache not as bad and jaw pain not as frequent, still pretty tired.  I went to bed straight after dinner and then felt great on Thursday.

                                                Was doing CDC TEXT tracing first week after injection, but new reactions started after tracking completed. Had mild reactions originally. Pain in arm, and fever next day that rose to 100.9. No chills, no major problems, no rash. A couple nose bleeds on second day which were not typical for me. Returned to work on third day. Now on day 10 I&#39;m convinced I&#39;m having a delayed reaction. Still mild but present. Low temp 99.5, headache, fatigue, feeling of not being normal. Not allowed to work today. Reason for report of such mild symptoms is my surprise of this delayed reaction 10 days later. There is a bruise on my injection arm now, opposite side of arm, that also is puzzling, but not really worrisome. Know to monitor for platelet issues.

The rest of the day it was clear but a small amount appeared Monday morning as well. Both sides of my temples are sore to the touch as if they were bruised. Other than that and being weak the other symptoms are gone.

I kept waking up scared.  I started to have a flare up of my Arthritis. I still have feelings of tiredness, headaches and my back has been really flared up. I have a disability with my spine being crooked. The pain has been a lot worse than normal. I have been visiting the Chiropractor frequently three weeks after my shot. I did not have as much back pain before the vaccine.

I had periods of nausea and dizzy spells for the following week. I had an extreme migrane the night of the shot and chills throughout the next week. I did not report the symptoms to  anyone because I had not heard that these were reactions to this vaccine. After I heard that others were experiencing similar symptoms, I felt I should report my experience.

I went to urgent care, as I had pain in my ears. They washed out my ears because they had wax, the pain was relieved, and the tinnitus diminished, but I still have the ringing in the ears a week after the vaccine. It has subsided some, and is most noticable at night.

A urinary culture was negative on 31 March 2021.  A few days after the vaccination, the burning pain and urgency subsided but was replaced by increasing lower abdominal pressure and pain.  The patient will see a doctor on 14 April 2021.  Other effects observed following the vaccination on 2 April 2021 include: headaches, muscle pain, injection site arm pain, sore throat. These effects resolved within 24 hours after the vaccination with exception of the sore throat which is ongoing.

                                                Developed heart palpitations approximately 10 hours after receiving vaccine. Also insomnia  making it impossible to sleep.  Palpitations seemed to get better by 11 am the next morning but my heart rate was still elevated ( pulse 106-112).  Shortly after that ( around 11:45 am) I became extremely light headed and dizzy and felt like I was going to pass out. I also started to feel nauseous and sweaty.   I rested lying down for two hours before hearing back from my doctor&#39;s office.  I was able to control the lightheadedness and dizziness by lying down. The feeling of passing out / nearly fainting went away.  I continued to feel nauseous and my  heartrate was still elected. I started to get a headache as well.  On the advise of a nurse at my doctor&#39;s office,  my husband took me to the ER.  My EKG was normal . My heartrate was elevated.  Due to the overcrowding at the ER that day I was made to wait at least an hour and half for further evaluation.  I continued to feel light headed and slightly dizzy. My nausea and headache got much worse .  I was finally taken back to a treatment room and received IV fluids, Zofran and Tylenol.  My heartrate went back to normal and my headache and nausea improved with treatment and I was discharged around 7pm.  I continued to feel very tired and slightly lightheaded that evening. The next morning  I was much more nauseous again and still very weak feeling and slightly lightheaded. I have  continued to feel weak, very fatigued , unwell and nauseous on and off until today, April 14, which is 6 days after I was vaccinated.

                                                Started on Monday morning at 8:30 am started feeling cold chills.  Took 800mg of Ibuprofen and after an hour felt better.  When going to bed around 9:00pm I noticed that my skin was soaking wet and that I had a hot feeling.  When I woke up in the morning  (tuesday April 13, 2021) around 7am I could not fully open my eyes.  I looked in the mirror and noticed that my entire face was swollen and was red in different areas.   I took some benadryl as I thought this was an allergic reaction and went back to bed.  A litter later I started getting cold chills and then hot flashes.   Around noon time I took another benadryl.  By 2:30 I was not feeling any better and I also had body aches and pains and called my doctor.  I was able to get in to the office.  I was told that I was having a reaction to the shot and that I was boarder line for the hospital.  They gave me a shot steriod shot and prescribed Metheylprednisolon tablets (24) to be taken as directed and to continue to take benadryl.   It&#39;s now Wednesday morning April 14, 2020 and the swelling has gone down but not fully gone and I have stated on the prescription.  I now have redness in my chest area.  I still have a some chills and hot flashes.

Was on a walk and went home and sat in a chair. 4 hours after injection my neck and upper back was killing me. I have had a previous injury from a car wreck 40 hears ago. I slept in the chair that night and the next days on a heating pad. My back felt like a horse kicked me. The next day my eyelids were too heavy to lift for about the duration of a movie. I could not fall a sleep, but could not lift my eyelids. I had vaccination on Friday night. I could not stand any sunlight until Sunday. My sinuses were killing me and the back of the head. On Sunday afternoon I could eat chicken broth and drank lots of water. By Sunday night, I felt fine and ran 5 miles on the treadmill. Feel great now.

She also mentioned that she was having a headache in the back of her head and neck which are known to be possible indication of a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis which has been rarely associated with the J&amp;J vaccine. I advised the daughter to take the mother to the emergency department for further evaluation and she agreed that she would take her right away.

Six days after the vaccine, I actually went to bed with severe cold chills which lasted several hours.  I am still experiencing intermittent periods of &#34;brain fog&#34; or at times feeling a little light headed.  Last Saturday was the only day that I haven&#39;t experienced feeling this way.  Again, it does not happen all of the time but it is bothersome. I am hopeful that after this Thursday (2 weeks will have passed since the vaccine) that symptoms will disappear. If not, I will follow up with my family practitioner.  Thank you!&#34;

                                                I took 1 Benandryl about 1 hour before the injection of the vaccine prior to leaving my home.  My son took me as I would anticipate some type of reaction given my history.  J&amp;J was the one my doctor recommended in hopes that I could handle the response better and only need 1 dose. I had options to get pfizer or moderna, but my dr wanted J&amp;J so I waited several weeks longer to get this one.  Within 10 minutes of having the injection, my  ears swelled up, and felt like I was on a bad plane and could not burst clear.  Then my throat on left side, the same side I got the shot swelled.  My face was full of red and rash and my son mentioned he was concerned how I looked.  I told him my symptoms and then took another Benadryl before we left the store. I told the pharmacist that I was having a reaction, they wanted to call 911-I said please no. I am used to having reactions and would want to see if I can manage it with Benadryl at home.  I came home and took my Alegra (as I take my alegra at night before bed to help with congestion).  Going forward every 2-3 hours I would take another benadryl rotating the time frames and slept as much as possible. It took several hours for the swelling to subside, longer than I was used to.  Over the next several days, I would have times when my ears, throat would swell, my face would be red and rashed, especially at night my face will get red, rash and ears and throat swell late at night. It waxes and wains depending on how I feel.   After the main allergic reaction of 12-24 hours later, I stared with the COVID symptoms, fever, chills, body ache, the joints that I have trouble with hurt so much more (knee, foot, arms, hands) I was so thankful I did not catch COVID. I don&#39;t think I would have survived. On Friday, March 19, 2021 was the first day I started to feel better except for the late night episodes of allergic reaction. I take Alegra or when needed Benadryl. It seems to lower my swelling response.

                                                Day one post vaccination - dull headache, leg pain, abdominal pain, back pain - these symptoms continued for a few days, I started to feel a bit better, did not take any pain reliever medications because I didn&#39;t want to mask symptoms.   On 4/14/21, 7 days post vaccination, my leg pain in both legs worsened including numbness and a burning sensation in both feet.  Back pain continued, arm pain started in both arms with numbness in both hands however the pain on my left side with legs and arms is worse. I&#39;ve had intermittent shooting pains in my left ear, left jaw, left temple and across the left side of my face. I&#39;ve also experienced shoulder and neck pain. The abdominal pain is intermittent and mild. On 4/15 - 4/18 the pain in my legs was so bad that it was waking me up at night and my arm pain was occurring more frequently. I decided to go to the ER on 4/18, day 11 post vaccination, due to my concern of a possible DVT or other type of blood clot.  The ER physician&#39;s assistant did not look at my legs but did several blood tests and other tests.

I woke up and was able to spit some of it out. It was clear and also tinged with blood. It stopped once I stood up. I immediately thought my brain was leaking.  I told my daughter about this the next day.  My balance was off and I had a weird flapping in my head for the next few days.  As well as a headache.  A few days after I heard about the blood clots. I am not 100% sure if it was from the shot but it was literally hours from when I received it. It was very scary.

She had several bad headaches since that vaccine up until her death on April 21st.  She was given the J&amp;J vaccine on April 8th at the CVS.  Died on April 21. at home. I just saw an article today, May 4th that about 1-2 hours from her death, another female in her 30&#39;s got the J&amp;J vaccine on the SAME DATE April 8 and she died on APRIL 19th. Pretty close in deaths and same vaccine. IS IT CONNECTED?

                                                4/11/21  (evening)  - Headache.  Called doctor on Monday. Took 1 aspirin with doctor&#39;s approval and was fine.  5/4/21 (approximately 1 a.m.)  Awoke feeling nauseous. Went to bathroom and proceeded to vomit four times over the next 90 minutes. Last episode was just vomiting water that I&#39;d sipped and could not hold down.  No sore throat, fever, chills or diarrhea. Just vomiting.  Able to handle crackers, ginger tea &amp; ginger beer. Plan to try soup today. Still more tired than normal (though 16-18 hour workdays don&#39;t help here), and stomach still feels a little unsettled.  5/4/21 - Present - Headache. Afraid to take aspirin as it might upset stomach that has already had a tough time.   NOTE: Regarding question on next page about adverse reactions to vaccines, I haven&#39;t had a vaccine since childhood. My parents, who were typically never sick, became terribly ill for months after receiving their first and only flu vaccine. One of my sister&#39;s had a similar reaction. For that reason, my other sister and I have never opted for vaccines in adulthood, until now. I just took it now because I don&#39;t want to die, my employer is pushing for us to return to campus, and I know my high school students will not vaccinate or wear masks if they can avoid it.

                                                I experienced after my J&amp;J vaccine headaches for two days. Then on 04-16-2021 upon waking up I had a red rash which was warm, hot sensation when touching my arm. This hot sensation radiated up to my neck, trachea and down my forearm. I got concerned about the red rash and because I felt my arm hot sensation and I went to see my doctor who asked me if I had trouble breathing or if I had any chest pain. I told him I could breathe and I was concerned about my rash. He prescribed Prednisone medication which I took several days to go away. To this day I still continue with the headaches that come and go and I take 2 acetaminophen to relieve the pain. I do not know if my headaches are related to the J&amp;J vaccine and the rash  has gone away.

On wed going home had bad cough. Then Thursday , left work early, had to go home. On the way there was like a circle of fire going around my heart to include that part of lungs. Had to bed rest till Monday. Dr. at Emergency gave a prescription of Antibiotics and a cough prescription, my son had to pick it up for me. Then a bout a week later I had finished dinner, taking my plate to the kitchen, body/brain completely quit. No time to get dizzy, speak out or say anything. JUST QUIT. My husband said I was in/out for about 10 minutes as he was trying to help me up. Right side of nose/head still has problems.

I started to see arcs of color in the peripheral vision of my left eye. Later this became more prominent. Overnight, I developed a headache and saw wavy colored/blurred lines in my left eye for about 10 min that obstructed my vision. I saw an ophthalmologist as I was very concerned. They suggested that as my eyes looked healthy under examination that it might be an ocular migraine. I still have a painful headache 26 hrs post vaccination. I?ve never had an ocular migraine previously.

My life partner started calling my name and check my pulse (which he said was strong) ; then I came to but was really dizzy; I was nauseous and vomited for a few minutes; extremely hot/sweating; and after I stopped vomiting, then had a bowel movement (He had to aid me in getting to the bathroom).   About 20 - 25 minutes later I felt much better; everything calmed down.  I was ultimately able to fall back to sleep.

                                                Was out shopping with friends and feeling fine but when driving home I noticed a high pitch sound in my left ear that abruptly started for no known reason.   I have pollen allergies to trees and due to staying indoors and wearing a mask I was having no bad allergy symptoms and never had tinnitus on my worse pollen day.   The tinnitus symptom was loud enough to notice over all other noise and very irritating in a quiet room.    The high pitch sound was non stop and constant.  I went to sleep that night and woke up Saturday morning still hearing it.  I felt that morning like I was having a very mild cold with very mild congestion.  I felt likeI had swelling under my ears    I was not tired but I did feel like staying in bed and sleeping  as if my body was mildly requesting it.  I slept most of the day.  Woke up with the high pitch sound but it seemed a little bit lower in volume.  Around 8 pm the sound left as quickly as it came

Woke on Friday  3/19/21 with fatigue and diarrhea with body aches.  Woke Saturday 3/20/21 with fever 101.7. (During this duration to include today I have  taken Tylenol rotating with Motrin every 2 hours, this never broke my fevers). Fever continues on and off with body aches, nausea, the worst headache I have ever experienced and pain in the base back of my neck L side.  These symptoms have continued since Saturday.  It is now Friday, 3/26/21.  I will say that during waking hours 8am - 10pm on Wednesday 3/24/21 and Thursday 3/25/21 I had no symptoms except absolute fatigue.  The fever returned on those two nights at around midnight with it breaking about 4 am, waking up in a pile of sweat.

Day 5 very tired despite adequate sleep. Mild diarrhea. Symptoms not bad enough to keep me home from work, but I thought it odd symptoms didn&#39;t begin to appear until 4 days after vaccine.

                                                On 03-25-2021, at 7pm, I started to feel flu  like symptoms with body aches but no congestion. In the morning it seemed getting better but then my symptoms got worse.  I took two Ibuprofen which helped. I still continued to feel tired. After my vaccine, I also got a weird taste in my mouth. I was very tired over the weekend. My armpit itched and so I scratched it and I felt raised bumps under my armpit, under the pit of my arms on both sides, right greater than left. My left arm was the one vaccinated. I also had bad diarrhea on 03-29-2021. Today I still continue with the rash under my armpits and still feel very tired and fatigued.

I went to the ER and they gave me fluids. I was told it was a reaction to the vaccine, but my paperwork said upper respiratory infection. My cough started out dry, I had SOB, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea and joint pain. My PCP put me on a steroid and an antibiotic Keflex (500mg, 3 times a day). I get lightheaded just walking around the house. I&#39;m still experiencing SOB, fatigue and the cough. Today is the first day that I could get up an move around. I&#39;m fine when I first wake up, but I eventually feel depleted.

                                                The next morning, 09:00 am, I had mild flu symptoms which was full body aches and feeling feverish and unwell. I didn&#39;t register a fever on the thermometer. I was very tired; no appetite. I stayed resting all day. Slept a lot. It was easy for me to sleep - very unusual. By 9:00 pm that all lifted and I was feeling back to normal. The morning of March 28, I woke up with a very sore throat. And on 3/29, I had really continued sore throat on and off and Tuesday it got much worse. There was a really strange sensation of being extremely thirsty - I had never had experienced that before. Swollen gland on the right side of my throat - between the jaw and ear area. I had a little bit of an earache on the right side. I drove by the drive-in testing area. I am working in person each day so I get the drive by testing - I think Tuesday, the 30th. Called the dr and did the Telehealth visit - Wednesday - the 31st. I had in and out of laryngitis - raspy voice and headache. I looked in my throat with flashlight and could see a definitive red spot in back of throat and some white spots.  They said it could be a blocked salivary gland and told me to eat something very sour to activate it. Over 6 to 8 hours it did clear the issue somewhat - thirst went away. I still had a sore throat. They told me that by the weekend, I could maybe start antibiotic. Saturday night I took first dose of Zpack - two tablets at first dose and then one tablet a day after that. By late evening Sunday (Easter) I felt some relief of symptoms. This week I still have a little bit of raspy voice and post nasal drip and clearing my throat at this point. I am recovering but not fully recovered.

                                                At 4 AM the following day I woke up with a severe headache and fever. I attempted to take 2 extra strength Tylenol which seemed to trigger cyclic  vomiting every 15-20 minutes for approximately 4 hours. After this, I vomited  once an hour for another 4 hours. I was finally able to sip water and sleep after this. I also took my first temperature once feeling better and it was 99.9F. My normal temp is in the 97s and I?m sure it was much higher during the vomiting.  My fever broke approximately 12 hours after the first symptoms. Headache lasted approximately 36 hours and resolved the next day, although a milder one did come back off and on for a couple more days.  I did not have much pain in the arm I received the injection in.

                                                Beginning approximately 10 PM (about 8 hours post-injection), I started to have chills (feet were freezing) and was exhausted. Went to bed, and slept most of the night, only waking once to urinate and to drink a small amount (approx 2 oz) of Coca Cola -- I was very nauseous and thought it would help settle my stomach. During the night I sweated profusely. At 8 AM,  I woke again and went to urinate. At that time I felt very nauseous, dizzy, and light headed. When I walked about 2 -3 feet to my bedroom, I collapsed on the floor - unconscious. My partner called EMS, they arrived minutes later. By then I was conscious. They transported me to Medical Center Emergency Room, where I remained for several hours. They indicated that my SYNCOPE was a result of dehydration. TODAY, 4/13, news of BLOOD CLOTS has compelled me to report my adverse reaction.

On March  28 (approaching 7 months after my illness) I was still positive for Covid Antibodies prior to the vaccine.

                                                Right after shot, did not feel anything that morning till around 5pm I started to feel feverish, headache, tired.  My arm never got sore or swollen.  AFter 5pm till, the feverish feeling and hot cold got worse as time went by and I started shaking uncontrollably - pretty severe.  I took Tylenol early hoping to stop the achy feverish and shaking but did not seem to help.  THis went to till about 1am or 2am when I could finally lay down and try to sleep.  The shaking had stopped.  I did take more Tylenol and drank some herbal chamole type of hot tea.  I could not sleep that night.  Next day I was exhausted, body aches and still had some feverish feeling.  By the way, took my temperature and it was normal.  Then on Wednesday, I believe is when I had a huge episode of diarrhea (came on sudden).  I kept calling and talking virtually to the doctor telling him all of what was going on.  The next day I the feverish feeling and body aches and being tired kept happening  - adding headache getting worse.  I kept taking Tylenol.  Seem to help some but did not take the pain away. EAch night , I could not sleep due to the headache.  I started to feel better but then on the weekend, I had that headache and tired feeling.  The headache was getting stronger and it circled my whole head and both shoulder and around my neck.  It scared me because I felt at times that my throat was getting smaller.  I could still swallow but it was so strange.  I kept putting heat packs and ice packs and taking Tyelnol.  I know that on Thursday or Friday the week, the doctor told me if I wanted to to go get tested for Covid and I did.  I was tested negative on both the quick test and the other test that takes longer.     I had that headache, sinus tension pressure for quite a few more days.  Overall it took 7 days. I had to take off  most of the week from my telework job because I could not function.  I also did not eat much and drank lots of water during this time.  It seem to go away and then about a week later, I got this painful diarrhea out of the blue and went to see an urgent care doctor.  They tested me for blood, urine, and stool and they were negative.  I was also having pain on my left side.  Then it seem to go away after I was on the BRAT diet for a few more days.  Then the diarrhea happened again the next week or so.  This week, as of yesterday, I got a very strange throbbing pain in my left hand and not sure where that came from.  It can be extreme at times.  I tool Tyleonol but the pain is still there.  Also, during this time and before the shot, I got a trigger finger issue on my right index finger.  I don&#39;t think that has anything to do with the vaccine.  Please note I have been told my doctors and I know this for a fact, my body is super sensitive to food, meds.  I don&#39;t usually get the flu shot because of that.  Today I am experiencing the left hand pain and now metal tasting in my mouth.  I am about 5 weeks out from the vaccine.  I wish I had never taken it.  I pray nothing more will happen  in my body  If I have left anything off it is because I did not write this down when was happening.  I really thought I was going to die one night because of the pressure I was having in my head, neck and shoulders.   I have a little bit of a headache now and told my PT doctor that if I needed to know, I could get a brain or some kind of scan to see if I am hainvg any issues. I am going to bring this up to my virtual call today.

She has an extreme splitting headache to where she feels her brain is going to go out of her head.  She has also had numbness and tingling down the right side of her body and into her tongue.   She cannot get to feeling better, she just keeps feeling worse.  She has taken Tylenol/Ibuprofen, and dr. put her on prednisone and gave her a Z-PA to see if this will alleviate symptoms.   Nothing she has taken has helped with it.   She feels as though her brain is swollen and that she going down hill.  She is a cancer survivor and cannot determine if having that has made her worse.   The pressure has gone to her ears, feels like it is going to burn her ear drums up.  She also has tinnitus with it as well.   She also has tinnitus and the headache that will not go away.   She has called her doctor many times and hasn&#39;t gotten any results back.

Continued pain after two days into two weeks, shooting pains , crawling at injection site,and throbbing, even at elbow and wrist.  Arm was also very weak, and still gets tired and throbs .  Has been 4 weeks this week-end . Reported to nurse who tod me to see my Dr. which I did this week.  No redness at injection site, just soreness, know something was off, according to side effects.   Very tired feeling, still, and had some flushed color the first week in my face and like heat flashes for two weeks.    Hope to get the normal feeling back in my arm.  Not sure ?   Maybe a nerve was nicked?  But was not like a Bee Sting like tech described it would feel like that day.  Had a ruff start.

Patient reports that she felt lightheaded after the vaccine when she was leaving. She got home and felt better but then that night woke up in a delirium which passed by the morning. She had some weakness in her extremities, brain fog, cold feeling, funny GI feeling and fatigue for 3 days and then was fine.   Two weeks ago she started to feel that the circulation in her lower legs was cut off with sensation of blood pooling in her legs with associated numbness and tingling. She describes it as what you feel when a tourniquet is applied to your arm.  No visible lower extremity swelling, redness and no pain.    One week ago she felt like her right hand was not working well and then left hand too. She then felt pooling in her arms like the sensation in her legs.No swelling, redness or pain.   She reports she did a hand stand and afterward felt pooling sensation in her lower abdomen which has since resolved but continues to have a prickling sensation that comes and goes.   Last night while lying on her back she felt the pooling sensation in her chest and this morning throbbing in head and chest and neck. That is when she decided to come in and be seen.    Patient denies severe headache, backache, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, bruises, unusual bleeding or rashes.   Patient has not had a physical exam with blood work since 11/9/17.

                                                My sister, received the J &amp; J vaccine on March 5th.  I now know that she was not feeling well for a few days afterwards.  She then felt better until day nine after the vaccine.  On the evening of the ninth day,  she began having abdominal pain, vomiting &amp; diarrhea, headache. This was Sunday evening.  Unfortunately I wasn?t aware of how she was feeling and she didn?t go to the emergency rm. until Tuesday morning.  Tests determined her platelet level was low and abdominal CT showed bleeding from her adrenal glands.  She was given platelets, pain meds and admitted into the hospital.  Later that night staff felt she wasn?t responsive and a head CT was performed.  It was determined she had a brain hemorrhage and emergency surgery was performed. It is my understanding that there was brain damage at that point.  During the early morning hours of the 10th day, post surgery, a repeat CT scan was done showing more hemorrhaging and blood clots. She also developed a  DVT and PE and was kept on a respirator until the 13th day post vaccine to allow family to say their goodbyes.  On the morning of the 13th day patient was removed from life support and she passed.

Began at around 10am. Felt like I was dying. Placed on Stroke Unit. Scans and tests all negative for stroke and Drs. thought could be panic attack or TIA. Since then my lingering effects point to TIA, Seemed to clear up around 2pm with gradual improvement through the day. Still experiencing some side effects including tinnitus, memory and word retrieval issues, fatigue, anxiety.  DO NOT HAVE PANIC ATTACKS. The only time I have had a panic attack was at 26 after the death of my mother.

I got chills and fever, but didn&#39;t take my temperature. The next morning, took my temperature and it was 101. Ate a piece of coffee cake with some tea. Was very tired, so went back to  bed. Was also a bit queasy, and not hungry for lunch, and had a mild headache. Slept most of the day, had chills and fever off and on, and joints very sore. I did eat dinner. The next day I was much better, but still had some soreness in my joints, one or two episodes of mild chills, was somewhat tired and lethargic. The next day I was more or less back to normal. I did take Tylenol at some point, but I can&#39;t remember if it was the afternoon of the first day of fever, or not until the next afternoon. I know I did take it again the next morning.  All in all, it felt like a full-blown case of the flu, but was of short duration.

                                                Tinnitus. Woke up with loud ringing in both ears, which has yet to subside. This has never happened to me in 61 years, so I&#39;m very sure this is related to the shot. Prior to that, I had run a fever, and had my whole upper arm swollen and hot , which have both just started to subside.

Got it stopped. Next day felt a bit off but okay.  At 9 pm 3-28-2021 had a huge bloody nose, just came out of nowhere.  Looked inside was coming from not the nose walls but from way up inside sinus cavity?  Tried to get it stopped, nothing worked, and 2 times it came out my mouth. Called our local Emergency room, went in.  Blood pressure was at one time 220/110. They gave me 2 sprays of Affrin to reduce blood vessels, and tried to insert a nose plug (cotton gauze) to stop it, wouldn&#39;t fit, too small of nasal passage.   Administered 2 pills,  then drugs through IV then another pill form over 4 hours later blood pressure was still high some numbers while there were 204/94, 188/93 then when released and bleeding stopped 188/86.  Next day 3-26-2021 immediately after taking my regular meds bleeding started again!!! So tried to get appointment with my doctor, they were full advised me to go /back to ER. Went about 1:00pm my BP was 181/73 Dr ran tests: EKG normal, Blood tests, good, and chest e-x-ray good. She also tried 2 diff types of meds, oral and iv, then I asked for losartan.  and left.

Left ring finger went numb, white and cold, with bruise appearing on the middle digit. Other finger tips turned pink. Skin turned red onhands with tingling sentation. Right hand blood vessels came to the surface and began to swell at intersections. Skin on rt. hand looked whiter and dry. The sudden onset sent me to the emergency room, the condition began to fade in 3 hours, not completely. The same reaction occured the next day at 12 noon. I took a hot shower and the condition improved followed by extreme tiredness. *At the time of vaccination, &amp; on both of these events I had a stiff neck/red skin.

                                                9 hours later began feeling a general &#34;ick&#34; like when coming down with something, then moderate headache and body aches, especially my back. This lasted less than 2 days.  Other things, mostly starting 5 or 6 days later and some cropping up as late as 4/11.    Random itchy red rashes on each shoulder and back of upper arm that would go away within an hour or 2.   Itching and possibly bumps on buttocks and thighs.  Intensely itching palms for a little while on 2 or 3 different days.  Sudden appearance of a 4 x 4 inch patch of 15-20 bumps of various sizes in the crook of my left elbow (injection arm) with bright red skin. These looked similar to mosquito bites or blisters but didn&#39;t itch. It completely disappeared without a trace within an hour.    Tingling tongue followed by tongue swelling on 4/6/21.  I had eaten my bran flakes with some rice pudding a little bit before this, both of which I&#39;d eaten every day for the past week or so and had had several times in the past. On the advice of my doctor&#39;s nurse, my husband drove me to an urgent care center. By the time we got there, probably 1.5 hours after this started, the swelling was some better. The nurse practitioner that I saw prescribed an antihistamine and 3 days of one 20 mg prednisone pill a day. I&#39;ve never had a tingling or swelling tongue before in my life. I took only a half of one prednisone on 4/6, no Allegra.  On 4/7 the random itchy red rashes mostly on arms/shoulders happened once or twice and disappeared fairly quickly, but my upper lip swelled. I could feel it happening as I sat in my recliner in the morning. I hadn&#39;t had anything to eat yet. The doctor advised I take my Allegra and prednisone I received at urgent care on 4/6, so I did. The lip swelling gradually went down over a few days, but it still feels irritated on the inside of the lip as of 4/11.   Diarrhea beginning around 1:30 a.m. 4/8. Lasted about 3 days. I only very very rarely have diarrhea.  Mild sore throat starting Friday 4/10. Better by Saturday. Sore throats are so rare for me that I can&#39;t remember the last one, possibly several years ago.

                                                That night, no chills or fever but uncontrollable shaking - 10 pm - 4 am in morning. Starting at 10, as well, body aches - run over by a truck type. My chest was burning like it was on fire - lungs felt like they were on  fire. I woke up the next morning, with a little bit of body aches - I slept the entire next day pretty much (the 7th). On the 7th, I noticed that my heart was beating - fluttering- skipping- beating. My left left also swelled up and was red. I had  PVCs with pulmonary embolism on that left leg  in1996 - when I was doing the chemo. My left leg ached, burned and got red on the 7th. I was going to see the PCP the following week and I was still having issues with the heart but the leg was getting better. It can still swell, burn and get red quite a bit of night because I stand on my legs all day - but the amount of pain and swelling did go down over that week while I was waiting to see the doctor. I had an ultrasound on my leg. And a heart halter to monitor my heart for 24 hours. I do have PVCs.  Stress from vaccine caused Herpes Outbreak - that was on the left inner thigh right next to genitals - bumps within four days of vaccine.  Created more pain. Took Benadryl for pain - helps with the nerve pain - two days with. I took 3000 mg a day of Tylenol for three days after the vaccine.  Have not recovered from the calf and heart symptoms.

In the middle of the night my headache kept getting worse, my eyes started to hurt really bad and I also broke out in hives. About 6 hours later my headache felt like it wanted to explode. I saw a doctor through Tele-health by  who prescribed a 6pk of steroids.  Then on Day 6, my headaches came back along with the hives and I felt really tired and the hives broke out all over my body including my crotch and ear canal. He prescribed a 6pk of steroids and I started to feel and get better. On Day9, all of my symptoms were resolved except for the fatigue. To this day I still continue to have fatigue.

I had acute leg pains in my sleep that evening but not since then. Every day since then I have a headache. It feels like swelling in my brain (and heat) and I&#39;m very upset and unhappy about it. I am a very healthy with no health problems. I don&#39;t go to  doctor or even have a doctor (except a gyn). The headaches have not subsided and are causing me  quite a bit of stress.

                                                8 hours after getting the vaccine I started feeling very cold. It came on me all of a sudden.  Shaking, shivering, teeth chattering ensued along with generally feeling very unwell.  (Similar to how I felt years ago after having surgery)  This progressed during the night to fever, chills, extreme body aches, stabbing pains in the head, heart racing, dizziness and nausea.  After 12 hours I started to feeling improvement.  At the 16 hour mark I am really tired and nauseous but feel like I&#39;m coming back.  Probably the worst I&#39;ve ever felt.  We considered going to the ER in the night.

                                                While waiting the 15 required minutes after the shot was administered..I experianced a headache and left jaw discomfort. Minor arm pain the first day, I expected that. Did my regular errands and was fine, a little tired.  The next day, (Sunday)...I went to church, had a headache, arms aching like mad, arthritic symptoms , legs cramping, joint pain in elbows especially, were off the chain!  I returned home and took immediately to the couch, where I had a low grade fever and stayed all day. I had no appetite, no energy to get up except to go to the bathroom.

                                                The actual injection itself was so painful that I almost passed out. It hurts so badly while the needle was in my arm and when she took it out it was worse. I was in such pain that I began to sweat profusely and apparently I turned white and began dry heaving. This was all within a minute or so.  I really thought I was going to pass out. A woman with a tag that said pharmacist came rushing over. She got a reclining chair with wheels, they help me into it and then took me to a recovery room. After a few more minutes of sweating and dry heaving I began feeling better.  The pharmacist got me some paper towels so I could dry myself off as I was drenched in sweat. I asked her for a bottle of water. I waited the 15 minutes and came home.  They never checked my vital signs. Once I got home, I laid down and slept for 15 hours. I was fine the next day and my arm was never sore.  Could  the shot have hit a nerve? I?ve never felt such acute pain.

Mild flu the next day with  general Malaise.  The chills were so intense that I was constricted for much of the time with little relieve. I would call them violent chills with a tetany kind of full body involvement.  Never have  I experienced chills like I have described. I?ve never had a reaction to vaccines and tend have a high tolerance. I did not contact my physician but spoke to colleagues who suggested  report the experience.

                                                I started running a fever and aching very bad Saturday morning. By Saturday afternoon my fever was up to 103.5.  I did not want to go to the hospital, but I came very close to calling. I decided to try ice packs on my forehead, neck and chest. I have never had a fever this high, or ached this bad. I don&#39;t know how long it took for my fever to come down, but finally came down to 102.5, where it stayed throughout the rest of the day and into Sunday.  I continued to use the ice packs throughout Sunday. I drank a lot of water and took Tylenol for fever and pain. I had a fever for three days. Today, Tuesday, 3/17/2021, I am very light headed.  I was diagnosed with covid-19 on Dec 29th 2020.

My vitals were checked, I was given water and moved to a cooler area of the facility.  HR was still elevated but I wasnt feeling as flushed.  By 4pm that evening I began having having chills and a fever of 100-100.4 which lasted about 4hrs.  Later that evening my HR elevated to 125 with the feeling of feeling I was having a heart attack.  By that Wed. my HR was still at 125 in motion and about 75 still so I went to visit my PCP on Thurs and when I arrived the HR was 77 but during the visit it elevated to 125 and blood work was done resulting in my tyroid level elevated and since getting the vaccine my HR had been up and down.  When in motion its elevated and when sitting its around 75.

                                                My wife got the J&amp;J shot last Wednesday and had the typical sore arm and a little fatigue. On the following Saturday she had a very severe episode of anger at the members of our household and wanted to leave our marriage, sell the house, and said she could not live like this anymore. She slammed doors, yelled and screamed, insulted everyone around her, and would not listen to reason. 3 days later she is calming down somewhat but still has a lot of anger.  I have lived with the woman for over 30 years and have never seen anything like this before. She does have her moments and has had mood swings in the past but  this episode was exceptional. I think she will be OK in a few more days but I wanted to report this to possibly prevent something similar from happening to others.  It is possible this episode was unrelated to the vaccine. It is also possible this is related to her heavy use of Neurontin with Prozac. Let me know if you have questions.

I went to the ER on March 19  for nausea and vomitting, was dehydrated and received IV fluids. I also had hives which I was prescribed Steroids for.  The next day, March 20, I went to urgent care for severe hives and was given a steroid shot and epinephrine shot.  I don&#39;t know if these symptoms are a result of the vaccine, but I did not have them prior to the vaccine so I thought they should be reported.  Thanks

I ended up going to the ER, they have me some steroids and breathing treatments, monitored my heart rate for three hours.  I stayed in the ER for 4 hours and discharged me. The next day I was feeling a little week but breathing better and heart rate was back down to normal.  I have a cough that&#39;s lingering a dry cough.

Per pt&#39;s visitor her color had returned to normal, pt still feels a little shaky. Pt rested another 5 mins, repeated vitals and pts BP was elevated. Discussed with pt and visitor that due to her hx of HTN and her already being on BP meds, pt should be seen in ER and EMS called. Explained that she should have an EKG done b/c of flutters and HTN along with headache. Educated pt on importance of being seen in ED. Gave pt and visitor time to discuss suggestion, when returning pt states, &#34;Talked to niece who is EMT and said I should be fine if I just went home, rested, ate, and checked BP and took another BP pill (1/2) like suggested with doc before getting ahold of physician. All they&#39;ll do in ED is continue to check BP&#34;. Advised pt that ED would do more than that. Pt refused EMS and wished to go home.

                                                I started experiencing dizziness when my head turned in a specific position. This began about one week after the vaccination. At the next VSAFE check I reported that I was having some dizziness and tiredness. However, I saw a doctor on April 2 and he diagnosed me with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo and treated me in his office using the Epley Maneuver. The dizziness was cured and I am not experiencing it any longer. I do not believe it was associated with the vaccination but had not seen my doctor when I completed the report on VSAFE.

                                                I got the vaccine at around 11am on 6th April.  By 8pm the same day I was experiencing very severe chills - I have never felt so cold before in my life,  and the evening was not cold..  The next day, 7th April,  I woke up with bad aches in various, seemingly random areas of my body:  both upper arms, outside parts of both thighs, center of back between shoulder blades.  Interestingly all the aches were symmetrical.  I had not done any serious exercise to cause these symptoms, just a stroll around the park after getting the vaccine. I also experienced crushing tiredness and had to go back to bed in the afternoon.  Today, 8th April at 5:30 pm my left arm at the vaccine site still aches, but all the other symptoms had vanished by the morning.  I&#39;m 5&#39; 4&#34; and weigh 114lbs.  My husband got the vaccine at the same time and had no symptoms.  We are speculating that my smaller size may have contributed to my adverse reaction.  He is 5&#39; 6&#34; and weighs 180lbs.  In spite of this discomfort I&#39;m so relieved and pleased that we were able to get the vaccine.  Thank you!

                                                Initial reaction was flu-like symptoms but more concerning reaction was a bad rash with red small bumps on the same side as the shot was given directly above my left breast that was severely itchy. This rash is just now starting to dissipate but still itches; I used OTC cortisone creme and Benedryl to address the itching. The other major effect involved my left arm. For a full week, the muscle in which the shot was given was extremely sore to the touch and the whole arm ached. I still cannot fully extend that arm above my head without it feeling like an aching weight. Lastly, I had a pain in the center of my back as a hard ache that one week later still has not fully dissipated. It appears to be going away, but has lingered longer than I would have expected.

                                                Four days after I received the vaccine (this week Tuesday), I suddenly felt very dizzy and faintish.  I sat down until the dizzy spell passed.  I felt very cold and clammy and nauseous.  My hands were very shaky. I  felt very weak and very tired so I slept the whole day.  Today I woke up and felt the same dizziness, very cold hands and nauseous.  Both times I had diarrhea.  I have never had dizzy spells before so I know this has to be vaccine related.

                                                Experienced all common symptoms as well as other I have not heard of. Mental fogginess began at 8 PM (8 hrs after shot) and lasted until late the next evening Chills began at 8:30 PM and continued until early Friday AM. There were also a few instances of hot flashes in between the chills. About 10 hours after the shot the following began: headache (I rarely get headaches), nausea, muscle aches - mostly my quadriceps, low back pain, pain in the back of my neck, general lethargic feeling. These all lasted into Thursday evening, except the low back pain, which lasted into Friday AM. I felt a dull pain in all my back teeth that lasted about a day and was intermittent.

                                                2 hours after I received the vaccination, I came down with severe chills.  My entire body was shaking and I could not get warm.  I got extremely fatigued to the point that I could not get out of bed.  I got a severe headache (and I get headaches a lot...this one lasted for almost 10 days).  It seemed that every bone and muscle in my body began aching, from head to toes.  My fever went up to almost 102.  These symptoms continued for a course of four days, except the headache and fatigue (which lasted for approximately 6 days and the headache for 10 days).  I alternated Tylenol, Advil and Alleve.  They did not help hardly at all, unfortunately.  2 weeks later, I developed lymph node swelling in my right arm pit and alongside my right breast.  Today, these lymph nodes are still swollen and are painful to the touch.  I experienced pain at the injection site and if I touch it, it is still painful today, but does not ache like it did initially.

Early Monday, 4/12/21, I woke up with a severe sinus headache. I took some sinus medicine by 7 am but it remained fairly strong for 2-3 hours. It eased up some so I went to work and by 11 am took another dose of sinus medicine. I felt nauseated so I ate a couple of Tums through the afternoon. I assumed it was related to the sinus medicine.  After work, I went home and was very tired. I went to bed earlier than normal but woke up this morning feeling normal. (With a mild - as usual - headache)

I was given a prescription for Xarelto and an antibiotic , Levaquin, 500mg.. I came home.

I had the corona virus in July 2020 and I feel like I did when I had the virus only worse!  I am now going on day 3 and am still feeling these adverse affects and am wondering how long I can expect them to last.  When I had the virus in July 2020, I was sick for 3 weeks.  Will I be sick for 3 weeks with these vaccine side affects?  I am taking tylenol and ibuprofen but they are not helping much.  Taking Vitamin D and Zinc supplements and trying to drink lots of water.  I haven&#39;t yet contacted my doctor thinking these side affects will go away soon but I am getting concerned.

Then began to get headache with slight fever and the headache got progressively worse, with nausea and rapid heart rate. The headache was so bad I could not sleep at all - the worst headache I have ever had. I took one extra-strength Tylenol at about 10 or 11 am the next day, March 12, which took the edge off the headache. The headache diminished till it was gone by about 8 or 9 pm. The rapid heart rate, along with tiredness, low energy, and feeling jittery continued for several days, then stopped.

Symptoms began on 3/7/21, woke up horizontal binocular diplopia at 8:30am. Has been constant since it started. It is worst when looking to the left and best looking the right. Worse in the distance. No other associated symptoms   3/13/21: Around noon, was just sitting in the chair. She reports that she got a bad headache and then the entire left side of the body from head to toe was numb and burning in the left side face. This lasted all day, but completely resolved by night time.  Had never had anything quite like that in the past. She had a headache that started soon before the numbness, that also lasted most of the day.   3/15/21: was seen in ED with reported normal MRI, CT, and EKG   MRI brain with a small left pons lesion near the cranial nerve 6 nucleus   She was seen by Neuro-ophthalmology Dr. (attending), Dr. (fellow) 3/17/2021 &#34; MRI brain on 3/15/21 did not reveal a structural etiology for diplopia.  Differential diagnosis includes microvascular ischemic left 6th nerve palsy versus possibly post-vaccination cranial nerve palsy (received COVID vaccine 2 days prior).  Also on the differential diagnosis but less likely, includes myasthenia gravis (she did not have expected abduction saccade slowing of the left eye typical of an ischemic cranial nerve palsy).  Thyroid eye disease also would be less likely.  We will obtain antibody testing for myasthenia and thyroid eye disease.  Today we applied a 10 prism diopter base out prism over her left glasses lens.  I instructed her to remove this when appropriate, as I expect her diplopia to gradually improved.&#34;  4/7/2021 acetylcholine ab receptor negative, TSI negative, TSH receptor antibody negative, LH/FSH normal,

I alerted the person at the vaccination site saying something was not right and then they called the paramedics who took my vitals and said my heart rate and blood pressure was extremely high. They gave me a shot of Benadryl and oxygen because I was feeling shortness of breath. They kept me until about 11:35 in observation when I felt myself again. The headache, nausea and body aches stayed for about 2 weeks but all other symptoms subsided.

It did not resolve with aspirin, which prompted me to check my blood pressure.  My BP was extremely elevated at 145/85.  I then took 1 dose of common &#34;water pill&#34; 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide.  This did not bring down BP or resolve headache, 2 hours later I took 20 mg of Valsartan.  This also did not resolve headache or lower BP, so I took another 20 mg of Valsartan, followed by another 25 mg of water pill.  My BP stabilized later that evening and headache resolved by 8 p.m.  This same event occurred 2 more times, the last day being 4/10/21.  On that date I was completely incapacitated by excruciating headache.  I took 40 mg of Valsartan but headache did not resolve until late that evening.

                                                received Jansen vaccine on 3/31/21 and the following day I had a headache,, achy and tired.  I expected this, but a few days later I was still having what I describe as migraine type headaches and at one point I was sweating profusely, dizzy massive headache with not only nausea, but  dry heaving so bad I could barely get to my medication and seriously thought it would never subside.  I continued with headaches up until today April 14.  This is the first day I have not had a headache.  I contacted my vascular doctor as I had a blood clot several years ago and he has prescribed Eliquis twice a day for the next 2 weeks.   Today marks 2 weeks and like I said, it&#39;s the first day I have not had a headache

Began having a dry cough, went to nurse to as if normal, she said no, she started monitoring me. Still had cough, then became light headed and nausea. She gave me 25 mg of  Benadryl,  coughing continued, breathing became rapid, then I was given  shot of epi,  I became dizzy again and couldn?t complete a sentence. Words were slurred, heart beat racing. EMT?s were called. Received another shot of  Benadryl. It did not counteract anything. Received another shot of epi. Had uncontrollable shakes and hard to breathe or speak.  Was difficult to get BP reading due to shaking. Finally got reading of 196/99. EMT listened to heart and lungs. Said all was good. Taken to ER for monitoring of heart, Lungs and BP. Was there for approximately 2 hours u til shakes and BP were good.

                                                On Tuesday, April 6, 2021, about 11:45 am, I felt a sudden sharp pain in the right temple area just above eye level and about 2 inches posterior.  I also felt some dizziness and wondered if I was having a stroke or some type of arterial inflammation.  At the time I was treating a patient and wondered if I was going to have to leave to go home.  I did get through the rest of my workday but had difficulty concentrating.  I had recurring waves of pain in the same area several times that day and into the evening, was considering alerting my adult daughter that I might need to go to a hospital.  Fortunately, resting and increased fluids seemed to resolve the pain and it was mostly gone by the next day.

Patient was noted to be in severe metabolic acidosis, renal failure and shock.  Chest x-ray showed interstitial infiltrates and she tested positive for SARS-CoV2.  She required intubation and mechanical ventilation. CT brain showed encephalomalacia and atrophy, no new changes. She was transferred on April 8. She was given IV bicarb for persistent metabolic acidosis. Initially she was only treated with steroids, then antibiotics were added for fever and persistent hypotension.   She started to spike fevers up to 40.  Abdominal CXR ordered prior to MRI,  showed possible pneumatosis.  A follow up CT April 13 abdomen/pelvis was done which shows colonic pneumatosis, with air in the SMV, portal vein, air in the liver. No thrombocytopenia; platelets on April 13 were 310k, as low as 260 on April 8.

Followed by nausea and violent vomiting. (EMT Vitals were all normal and they didn&#39;t think it was an allergic reaction this long after vaccine so I declined hospital ER visit.)  After several hours of severe dizziness I developed violent chills with heavy breathing that lasted 20 minutes then stopped.  Much improved after 24 hours but two days later I still have considerable dizziness. Headaches occurred Earlier in the week but none with onset of dizziness. Otherwise I experienced the typical fatique and flulike vaccine side effects with no pain at injection site about 2 days after vaccination that lasted several days.

                                                I received the Janssen COVAX on Monday morning, 5 Apr 2021.  A week later, on Monday evening, 12 Apr 2021, I experienced extremely painful leg cramps and broke out in a sweat. I felt extremely nauseous, and weak, this was followed by a sever pain in my head that was so extreme that I passed out. After coming to, the pain in my head finally began to subside, along with the leg cramps. My husband indicated that I was unconscious for just under a minute.  For the next two days, I had bouts of nausea, headaches, sweats, and was extremely tired.  On Wednesday, 14 Apr, after learning of the issues related to the Janssen vaccine, and the symptoms described being what I experienced, I contacted the advice (cont&#39;d)..Additional information for Item 18: Line and was told to go to Emergency Room at the hospital, which I did.  I do not feel that they addressed my concerns or the symptoms that I was experiencing, and at no time did they try to determine if it was due to the vaccine.  The discharge papers did not even address the &#34;event&#34; and the &#34;symptoms&#34; that I described.  They did not take any information down related to the vaccine, lot number, etc., that I had received.  They seemed to go through a set routine:  blood pressure, blood work, temperature, EKG, and CAT scan.    21. (continued)...Visited Emergency Room, however, was requested by ER to go to Primary Care as follow-up, however, as a  Employee we cannot be seen by Primary Care on THIS site.  Instead , we have to go on the local clinic to receive care.  The issue is that this was a vaccine that I was scheduled by my leadership to receive, with no choice in choosing which vaccine I could receive, and without follow-up care for adverse reactions. The hospital did not indicate to me that I should report this incident, however, I am concerned as a result of the &#34;event&#34; that I experienced, that it should be reported.  Furthermore,we should have a choice as to which vaccine we want to receive, just as everyone does.  Your form does not allow for input addresses  Also, your form does not allow for a phone number.  I am out of the country.

                                                2 hours after receiving the vaccine, I grew exhausted and had to sleep into late evening and was chilled,  had a fever of 101 and developed severe pain and inflammation on the top of my collar bone that was feverish and migrated toward my shoulder region on the same side as my vaccine. Ibuprofen would not help with the pain but helped with the fever. My mind told me that I had things to tend to the next day, but still was forced to sleep off and on for 2 more days. After a week and a half, not only did I have thirst, but also food didn&#39;t taste right and was metallic.  This lasted for 2 days and finally my taste was restored. The exhaustion lasted off and on for 2 weeks and I just listened to my body. The pain and inflammation on my collar bone has subsided 4 days ago but still have pain in my shoulder when I sleep.  On April 5 around 8:30 a.m. a nasty virus hit me out of the blue. I grew week and tired and had to go to bed. I slept all day until around 9:00 p.m. and woke to uncontrollable diarrhea and fainting spell while in the bathroom. I had abominable pain and nausea that last for a half hour and then I returned to bed. The next 2 days, I was week and exhausted but continued with my regular routine.  My equilibrium is still affected from time to time.

Every tooth in my mouth started throbbing at around 11 hrs  and continued for about 5 more hours. Also during that time, waves of nausea but no vomiting, also uncontrollable shivering but I wasn&#39;t cold and I wasn&#39;t hot but weird shivering. I did not take my temperature as I didn&#39;t feel like I had a fever. Around 13 hrs after a stabbing pain in front of thighs like hot pokers started and around 14 hrs thigh pain was still present but then the calves on both legs started to get the same stabbing pain.   At around 24 hrs after - headache remained, pulsating teeth stopped, thigh pain stopped but calf pain remained. Headache remained off and on for several days. General brain fog also lasted for about 1 week. The calf pain comes and goes even after 2 weeks. Arm where shot was administered was very tender to the touch for the last 2 weeks.   Lastly, I wouldn&#39;t say I had shortness of breath but at times I just felt like I needed to stop and force myself to take a very deep breath.

I am surprised, however, that  I am still feeling very fatigued 19 days later. This is not serious, but I thought that reporting the data could help. My guess is that I am very tired as my immune system is building its immunity, but that?s just a guess.

So another hour passes and I get home, go directly to bed and what seems like a bad flu begins.   That night my temperature continues to climb, the aches and headache are horrible.  I continue fevers for 3 nights.  Feel a little better and then with 2 days it relapse and all starts again.  I am in bed for 1 and 1/2 weeks, then stay home due to continued headache, dizziness.  After 3 weeks the dizziness continues and I then start getting an aching pain in the back of my left leg.  Seeing my doctor on May 11th and hope to discuss.

                                                I noticed aching in my legs and 3 hours later I woke up and it was worse. I also had chills and shaking, a slight headache, and mild nausea. This continued into the next day (March 7, 2021). It was significantly better by mid-afternoon.

About 1:00 am I got so chilled I couldn&#39;t get warm, I did not take my temperature because my thermometer goes under my tongue and I was afraid I would break it cause my teeth were chattering so bad. The next day I felt very weak and nauseous.  Then I discovered I had a rash at the top of my legs. My left breast was very sore I felt like  someone punched me. Today is Monday and I still have diarrhea.

I woke up the next morning with a headache, chills, runny nose, fatigue, and nausea.  I took an allergy medication and stayed in bed.  This lasted all day.  I woke up the next day feeling fine, except for the constant runny  nose.  Also, on that day, I started having &#34;floaters&#34; in my left eye that I never had before (probably unrelated but I want to let you know).

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Based on the paperwork I received at my vaccination, I am reporting my side effects for your records.  I received the dose (1805029) on 3/12/2021 (Friday) at 4:30 in the afternoon. At around 10:30 p.m. I began to feel unwell with chills, shaking/tremors of my hands/arms, and overall aches. I had trouble sleeping through the night due to these symptoms in addition to night sweats (fever).  These conditions persisted through the next day (Saturday) and evening (24 hours).  I managed to sleep 8 hours and had only a headache the following morning (Sunday).  I treated my symptoms by taking Tylenol which was helpful.  Hope this helps with your research/records.

About 8 hours after injection, muscle ached and so was chilled but felt ok otherwise.  FitBit alerted me that I was earning points for being in my ?active zone? even though I was just watching tv - resting heart rate is 66   (actively exercising, heart rate  is usually less than 120) but it was 136&#43;.  HR stayed elevated ( Verified HR with pulse oximeter) while I was not  doing anything. Took temperature (forehead thermometer) and it was 103F.  Took Tylenol. Heart rate slowly went down after Tylenol kicked in and fever came down to 101.  Heart rate stayed a little higher than normal and fever lasted 24 hours. By 48 hours, all was well.

I believe I was running a high fever and was having trouble keeping the thermometer in my mouth because of the spasms but it did get up to 103.4.  By morning, my temperature was down to 99.9 and I continued to run a temperature for 48 hours.  My normal temperature is 97.2.  I also had for fatigue for about 5-6 days but it was minor.

Vomited in middle of the night.  Felt very drained and tired with myalgia all of the next two days.  Majority of symptoms went away after that but I felt as if I was coming down with a cold for the next 7 days - today my nose has been running all day and I have a stuffed head  (and I have not had a cold since November 2019). I  had a covid test yesterday because I need to accompany my husband for a medical procedure on Friday - that was negative. I have seen no one, gone nowhere, and done nothing different since I received my vaccine than I had beforehand yet I am displaying symptoms normally associated with a cold although I have no fever.

Headache became worse, and fever during the night.  By morning dizziness, extreme fatigue, severe headache and stomach upset which continued throughout day and night of second day.  By third day symptoms had subsided some but still incapacitating.  By fourth day better but symptoms still there, kind of how a hangover feels.  Each day since there has been a little more improvement.  Received the shot Tues. morning.  Now it is Sunday morning, and still some fatigue and dizziness, but headache is gone and stomach better.  Only medication I used during severe symptoms was tylenol.

I experienced nausea, pain in my upper back and my heart raced for approximately 10 hours.  On Tuesday, March 16, 2021 I slept on and off for the entire day and continued to have a fever.  My heart rate came down within 24 hours after my injection and the fever came down to normal 36 hours after the injection.   I felt weakness for approximately 3 days after the injection.  I am currently recovered from all symptoms as of  March 22, 2021.

Took Tylenol and it helped for about 3 hours.    03/15/2021 Woke up with symptoms again around 2:30 am and took Tylenol.  Woke up around 8 am with slight headache and VERY tired.  Kept a nagging headache and &#34;brain fog&#34; all of the day  and tired.  Took Tylenol and it helped some.  I felt a bit foggy all day even with Tylenol.  3/16/2021 Still felt tired with a bit of a headache on and off. Took Tylenol and it helped.    I don&#39;t take meds often so I just took 500 mg Tylenol, 1 tablet. I am healthy with no underlying conditions and do not have reactions to the flu shot.  I expected the same  with this shot.

At bedtime, around 10:30 pm, I could not fall asleep, was freezing, achy, in and out of sleep.  Took temperature at around 2:00 AM.  My temp was 102 deg. F, my pulse was at 125 bpm.  I could feel my heart rate beating rapidly.  Was still dizzy.  At around 6:30 AM, my temp was 101.9 deg. F.  Stayed home from work.  Got out of bed around 2:00 PM.  As I went to the restroom during the morning, early afternoon, my temp gradually decreased, my heart rate gradually decreased.  Still had headache.  Was very fatigued.  The next day, my temp was normal, had mild headache and was still fatigued.

                                                I had my shot at 3:45 pm on friday, the 26th of March.  at around 6:30 I started to feel nauseous and started to get body aches.  Lot of congestion and a runny nose.  I also got a stomach ache later in the evening.  by the time I went to bed around 10 pm I hurt all over and was very sick to my stomach.  I felt like if someone touched my skin my bones and muscles would all shattered.  I did not sleep much that night and woke up on Saturday, the 27th with the same symptoms but not quite as bad.  I still had nausea and a stomach ache and was very tired and drained.  I did start to get diarrheic around 3:30, 4:00.  I still hurt and have diarrheic and am very tired today, which is Tuesday, the 30th of March at 5:15 pm.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported.  The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included seasonal allergies, and codeine allergy. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1802068, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 05-MAR-2021 to left arm as prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 06-MAR-2021, after vaccination, she felt fine all day and night. The next morning she woke up and felt sick. She had nausea, headache, hive under eye. She laid back down and tried to sleep. A few hours later, she woke up to use the bathroom. She was very nauseous and dizzy. She lost consciousness and fell trying to get to the bathroom. She fell on her bed and was uninjured. The paramedics took her to the hospital. She was given medication for nausea, headache, and IV fluids. She gave blood for lab tests and they came back normal. No COVID test was administered. When she felt better, she was released. A few days later, she discovered her tongue was sore and red. She called her primary care physician (PCP). PCP said the red and sore tongue was probably related to allergies. Two weeks later, her tongue was not sore, but still red. They advised her to get a second opinion with another HCP. She was going to visit her allergy specialist.. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea, fatigue, inflammation on left eye, and small hives under eye on MAR-2021, and vomiting on 07-MAR-2021, and had not recovered from canker sore under tongue, and the outcome of fall on bed was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged).  Additional information was received from the patient on 23-Mar-2021. The following information was updated and incorporated into case narrative: Patient&#39;s medical history added as seasonal allergies and codeine allergy, Vaccination site as left arm added; Additional events as small hives under eye, fall on bed; lab test of blood work added; Event outcome of loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea, and fatigue was updated to recovered/resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: v1: Follow up information received updates  patient&#39;s medical history (seasonal allergies and codeine allergy), Vaccination site as left arm; Additional events (small hives under eye and fall on bed), laboratory test (Blood Work); Event outcome  (loss of consciousness, fainted, heart was racing, dizzy, headache, nausea and fatigue was updated to recovered/resolved). This updated information does not alter prior causality assessment of reported events 20210323730-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S-headache, nausea and fatigue. These events are labeled and are therefore considered potentially related. 20210323730-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S-loss of consciousness, fainted, heart racing, dizzy, vomiting, canker sore under tongue. These events are considered unassessable. The events have a compatible/suggestive temporal relationship, are unlabeled, and have unknown scientific plausibility. There are no information on any other factors potentially associated with the events.

The next morning I was very tired. As time progressed, I felt like I HAD to be horizontal. No energy at all. No appetite at all. Took my temperature and was shocked to see it at 101.4º. Pharmacist suggested I take aspirin, which I took one, and then another one several hours later. It did help and reduced the fever to 99º.  The following day the temperature remained at 99º but under 100º. (I never took any other aspirin other than the two that I mentioned). The third day I was good to go!

Then at 9 hours after injection, I began being nauseated and began vomiting.  The vomiting continued about every hour for the next 11 hours, feeling very ill between, and unable to keep down even sips of water.  Also had a mild headache, but still no fever.  Just very extreme nausea.  After 11 hours, the vomiting stopped.  I felt tired and nauseated for about 2 more days, then improved.

She stayed longer due to questions and her sister getting vaccine also. I had to call PCP for sister to get vaccine due to medical issues. I could not get through to PCP informed her I would call her.  I called to tell them they would need to  call her sister&#39;s PCP At about 0846 she stated she was not feeling well. Stated she thinks her right side may be numb-tingling and right side of face. Informed her to go to ER if she thought she was having an allergic reaction or call 911. She stated she was in ER parking lot now. Stated her PCP wanted her to have this vaccine and she is allergic to Epinephrine, informed her to tell ER what she just told me and that she had received the COVID vaccine. At 3:00 PM client called and asked if predisone she got in ER would elevate her BP. She stated ER papers say paresthesia of skin, TIA vs allergic reaction to vaccine, work up TIA symptoms and sent home to follow up with PCP.

She reported onset of headache and fatigue day of vaccine. She reported later feeling short of breath and having a  decreased tolerance of activity.  She stated she had an elevated heartrate and &#34;neurological symptoms&#34;, but did not specify. She reports still feeling off at this time 4/13 and having appointments scheduled with a Vascular surgeon and neurologist in the near future. I am doing the reporting as the vaccine was given by Public Health staff, but this is the first notification we have received of the her potential adverse reaction.

I had to regulate my breathing by slowing it down. When I opened my eyes the light was so bright I had to keep them closed. I thought I was going to faint. I finally decided to put my head between my legs and then I started too pullout of it.  Very scary feeling.   This lasted for 10min.

                                                My symptoms started 03-18-2021 at 11am where I developed chills, was very sleepy that I slept 15 hours straight. I felt very fatigued and my eyes hurt so much and I could not keep them open. On 04-06-2021 I still was not feeling well. I started to have problems with my right side of my face, eyes and mouth which gradually got worse so I went to the hospital. At the hospital they checked me for stroke, performed lab work, did MRI and CT scans and the  the doctors came back and said it was Bell&#39;s palsy. I again went to the hospital 04-11-2021 but this time due to GI issues with pain.  On 04-14-2021 through 04-15-2021, I started to experience neck pain behind my right ear. At the hospital they had prescribed my prednisone 50mg, so I took half for my pain.  I still have trouble sleeping and have lots of pain.

The mouth pain went on off and on for about 7 days gradually subsiding in intensity over that time frame.  The headache only lasted for a few days.  I also felt some pressure behind my left eye.

                                                I received the vaccine on a Saturday evening and by Sunday morning, I was sick as a dog with flu like symptoms - massive headache, terrible backache (like someone kicked me in the back), chills and fever.   Sunday evening in the middle of the night, in bed, I was shaking so badly from chills that I was afraid to get up to get Tylenol.  I finally did and I couldn&#39;t even focus my eyesight and control my hands as I went to open the bottle of pills that my hands were shaking so badly that I spilled them all over the place.   Finally I woke my husband who heated up blankets in the dryer and brought me hot tea.  My husband helped me to the bathroom where I vomited.  I cannot remember when I was so sick.  I missed work that day at my part-time job and the next day at my full time job as a teacher.

                                                72 hours later I was hit hard with severe chills, extreme nausea, some vomiting (foam) and diarrhea.  Day after vaccine, I had mild symptoms - woke up with mild chills and was very tired - slept most of the day.  Following night I had the worst night sweats ever - woke up drenched.

On 28-MAR-2021, the patient experienced pressure choking and difficulty swallowing. The patient visited 2 clinics and an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist but they were unable to diagnose and they felt there was some autoimmune effects (onset date unspecified). The patient suspected that the vaccine was contaminated based on the news report. On 02-APR-2021, the patient experienced stomach burning sensation. On 04-APR-2021, the patient experienced night sweats. On 05-APR-2021, the patient experienced tooth pain. The patient has been visited two clinic Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included: famotidine for 14 days for pressure choking and difficulty swallowing. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from severe stomach cramps, vertigo on 28-MAR-2021, night sweats on 06-APR-2021, stomach burning sensation on 05-APR-2021, and injection site lump, and injection site pain on 16-MAR-2021, had not recovered from felt ill, sinus inflammation, chills, fatigue, sensation of pressure in ear, tooth pain, foggy feeling in head, pressure choking, and difficulty swallowing, and the outcome of diarrhea, fever blister, facial pain, some autoimmune effects and suspected product contamination was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: v0 This report involves a patient who experienced sinus inflammation, sensation of pressure in ear, injection site lump, chills, felt ill, injection site pain and fatigue next day after receiving Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Ad26.COV2.S for prophylactic vaccination. Approximately a week later, the patient experienced stomach cramps and diarrhea and 1.5 weeks later she had foggy feeling in head and &#34;believes the vaccine is contaminated&#34;, had fever blister, facial pain and vertigo. Approximately 3.5 weeks after being vaccinated the patient experienced pressure choking and difficulty swallowing. A throat (ENT) specialist was unable to diagnose and they felt there was some autoimmune effects. A month after being vaccinated the patient experienced stomach burning sensation, night sweats and tooth pain. Given the close temporal relationship and the nature of the events, the events of sinus inflammation, sensation of pressure in ear, injection site lump, chills, felt ill, injection site pain and fatigue are considered related to the vaccination. The insufficient information precludes a meaningful medical assessment of the remaining events, including &#34;autoimmune effects&#34;. The events will be assessed further when additional information is received.

                                                4 hours after receiving vaccine I came down with overwhelming head pain that could not be lessened with pain medication.  No pain meds worked at all - all I could do was sleep.  I had nausea, muscle aches (bad-still suffering);  While still undergoing symptoms I got my teeth cleaned at the dentist (BIG MISTAKE).  I came down immediately with a severe periodontitis infection that needed treating with antibiotics.  The dentist was dubious that the infection had anything to do with the teeth cleaning (I disagree- I believe the infection exacerbated the period of disease (2 weeks one day )   I am writing because I literally CRINGE each time I hear about the Janssen vaccine only effecting a handful of people!!  I SAY CRAP TO THAT!!   This is a bad vaccine.  I have not been this ill for decades and it is doubtful to me whether or not it was worth getting this vaccine at all.  I would NEVER take it had I know HOW BAD and HOW LONG the side effects lasted - Over 2 weeks.  I highly recommend that this vaccine is permanently shelved.  I would not wand ANYONE to undergo what I have gone through the past 2 weeks - obviously complicated to some degree with the oral infection and teeth cleaning, however, I have never in the past been affected by a vaccine or teeth cleaning in this way before - ever.

The skin of my upper body begin to itch and burn and got worse over the next couple day. It continued to get worse so I went back to the pharmacy on 15th but the pharmacist knew nothing regarding what I was experiencing and advised I used Aveno and swithch from Allegra to benedryl to help with the itching and if it didnt get any better to go to the dr.  Within the next couple weeks I reached out to my PCP a couple times but all he could provide it that I continued to take the benedryl because topical ointments wouldnt work.  Its still here but not as bad as it originally was.   I have a dermatologist appt on May 6th.  It had gotten better over the next few weeks but I am still experiencing the skin sensitivity.

That night of the shot, I had a headache - (Like a bus hit me) at 07:00 PM. The headache never went away after that. 24 hours later, I had a full body itch - I took Benadryl for that and that helped the rash. Since that first headache - I have had headaches every day. I have had to manage it with Tylenol and Ibuprofen and I still do. I saw my doctor 2 weeks after vaccine. My vision was going blurry about two weeks after my vaccine is when I really noticed it. My doctor sent me to an Ophthalmologist - I was told I had cataracts. I had my regular Optometrist - in January 2020 and nothing was noticed with cataracts. The doctor told me to try to manage the headaches and if I have any extreme pain then to go straight to ER.

I had a weird sensation in my nerves in my right arm and a little all over my body. I think the shot may have hit a nerve in my arm. Two weeks after the shot I was very pale, and my stomach was very upset. I had a headache and abdominal pain. I felt very ill so I didn&#39;t eat or drink much that day.  The smell of food made me throw up and felt really bad for 24 hours. I did not eat much for three days and it helped my nausea and I recovered after four days I still had the unusual feeling all over my body. I got some IV therapy twice and it helped. It did start to fade over time and I finally started to feel normal after a month. I am fully recovered now.

On 04-08-2021, I started to have tachycardia and high blood pressure.  I went to the ER where they performed triponents, did a CT scan of my abdomen and a chest x-ray.    I still continue with tachycardia to this day.

Developed a rash on face. These all developed within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine. Took a benadryl to be safe shortly afterwards. Itching lasted for approximately 2 days. The rash is still about the same.   There was also swelling at the injection site, plus a rash that developed at the site about a day later. Other symptoms, such as fatigue, tiredness, and achiness, seem to be more typical outcomes.  Also developed a swollen lymph node under the arm that received an injection. This occurred two days afterwards.

Staying hydrated, but skin on lips sheeting off at times.  Also, using Chapstick.  This is not normal for me and I can only connect it with having received the vaccine.  I think the symptom is improving, but it very slow and minimal.  This started shortly after receiving the vaccine a month ago and continues to this day.  Other side effects were very temporary:  Headache, fatigue.  No arm soreness at all.  Mild body aches within 24 hours, but diminished rapidly.

Lasted for 36 hours approx. 2) Approx ten days later on April 19th, 2021, I awoke at night with severe left shoulder pain/deep ache. It came and went over the next week, but became more constant and severe. I couldn&#39;t sleep most nights without sleep meds, and even then it was for a few hours, and on my back. I couldn&#39;t sleep on either the good and especially not the bad shoulder.  Via a phone call, my PCP suggested I begin treatment with Ibuprofen, 3-4 times per day. I took 2-3 Ibuprofen at a time. As of today, May 12, 2021, I am still taking Ibuprofen 3 times a day as I still cannot sleep on my bad (left) side. I didn&#39;t think this was related to the vaccine shot until my husband said that he also was having shoulder pain on the same side as the injection. His was milder and lasted about a week, but began about the same time as mine did.

I felt a burning all over my body (especially my back), and body aches, and began a fever which grew from 97.3 (my normal) to a high of 100.1  (&#43;2.8 degrees) within 2.5 more hours (by 9:30pm).   Very bad chills and fever.  By 9:30 took 1 500mg Tylenol.   Little sleep that night.  Felt very unwell next day (3/9) including headache.  At noon I could get up and get some food.  By 1pm fever subsided completely, but temporarily.  Fever came back by 4pm, but only to 98.6 (&#43;1.3 above normal).  Took another 500mg Tylenol.  Night 2 slept well. Woke up 3/10 no fever, headache gone, but balance still peculiar.  I noticed the first night that my sense of balance was off.

                                                at injection, arm was not opperable, too weak to pick up coat or purse. After about 15 minutes the full use of arm was back. The muscle is still affected and strained after 6 days. I waited a half hour at the site and got into my car at 3:45. On the drive home within 30 minutes my face started to itch and turn red, then my mouth inside started to itch, then my eyes started to itch. After that my throat started to feel gravely, so I took 75 mgs of gel cap benedryl. This is what I feel and take upon getting stung by a bee. I also took my albuterol inhaller two puffs which I also always have on me because of my asthma. I was sleepy but had dinner and went to be. I did not feel that I had to take more benedryl during the night.

                                                I experienced fever, chills, tiredness, and headache approximately five hours after administration of the vaccine on 3-10-21. Symptoms became severe within 30 minutes thereafter, at which time I experienced difficulty standing. After five hours with no improvement, I used my home blood pressure monitor to check my BP and HR; BP was high for me, 120/90 sustained, and HR varied between 135 and 150, with 143 being the most consistent value after multiple readings. I seemed to be experiencing a &#34;severe allergic reaction&#34; per the instructions I was given and called 9-1-1. I was transported to Hospital, treated in ER, and then admitted to the intermediate care unit. I was discharged to home on 3-12-21.

Starting at 3:30 PM  I began having mild body aches; by 5:30 PM the body aches were severe and accompanied by a fever of 100-101 degrees, headache, extreme fatigue and intermittent mild nausea. This lasted throughout the night with body aches severe such that I was awakened by them about once an hour.  By the following morning, Friday, 3-12-21, symptoms were still present but less pronounced, and the headache had abated. Slept most of the day and by nightfall had only lasting fatigue, which was still present this morning, 3/13/21. By this afternoon all symptoms had abated.

Gone by the afternoon.  I had fatigue throughout the day after the shot, and still have a little today.  I didn&#39;t feel I needed to contact a doctor at this point.

                                                Approximately a week and a half after vaccine my senses of smell and taste changed. Most food smells and tastes a bit  like acetone and slightly moldy. I also perceive that my breath and hands have this same smell. I had a mild case of Covid-19 in December 2020 and did not have these symptoms at that time. I had typical reactions to the vaccine for the 2 days after injection - fever, headache - but the impact on senses took some time to kick in. Those impacts have persisted, at least as of today.

                                                Immediately after the shot, I felt dizzy and started to sweat throughout my body including my hands.  I waited more than 40 minutes to see if improved but it was exactly the same. Didn&#39;t get better or worse. I did not report it immediately because it was not alarming and I did not feel bad. It was just my head that was spinning a little bit and sweating. After waiting more than 45 minutes I decided to drive home because the dizziness was not that strong. I would say it was like a 45% dizzyness if I have to calculate how I felt. The sweating passed after 4 hours and at soon as I arrived home I went to bed and relax. It is now 6:08 pm and the dizziness has improved considerably. I would calculate now about 10% of that vertigo feeling. It is getting better and better. I just wanted to point out that in no time I was feeling bad. Everything was just in my hearing labyrinth internal with balance. I also felt 20 minutes of echoing in my ears about 2 hours ago.

Right away after receiving the vaccine-- stiff neck on the left side which after a night&#39;s sleep, moved to my right side of neck. No big deal.     Tired &amp; &#39;drunk&#39; after the vaccine which lasted until mid-afternoon the next day.  No big deal.       The worst of all happened at 3 1/2 days, a rash started in the evening, went to bed, woke up the next day with rash almost everywhere. Red, swollen, &amp; itching like crazy.   The next day- Sunday, along with Monday &amp; Tues. was horrid. I am covered from my scalp to the tops of my feet, my crotch hurts, as do my breasts. Used Benadryl cream, aloe vera to no avail.

These symptoms are typical of those who have taken the J&amp;J vaccine and in fact, if you read the actual stories of the side effects of people who took this vaccine, shared on sites, these symptoms are closer to 100% present rather than the far lower and untrue percentage revealed by the CDC. These symptoms need to be better tracked and people should be forewarned how COMMON these side effects are; they are not rare!

Don&#39;t remember reactions to previous vaccines but not surprised considering allergies. Left side of face felt strange but didn&#39;t look any different when a selfie was taken. Sometime during the afternoon/evening, experienced a headache of short duration. Approximately six hours after shot, experienced chills and low grade fever. Simply went to sleep. Better the following morning, though very tired.  Probably unelated rough itchy patch on RIGHT arm the day following vaccine. Went away with no treatment.

At 5:30pm, same day, became immediate flush, dizzy, barely made it to bathroom, violently vomiting all that was in my stomach.  This was followed by severe chills, the shakes and a mild headache.  Took (2) Tylenol at the time of the shot, drank many ounces of water all day but still had this issue. Took another (2) Tylenol after vomiting and more water. Went to bed at 8pm.  Woke at midnight, 4/5/21, severe headache, now took (2) Advil and slept better until Mon. Morning, 4/5/2021.  Experienced two sluggish, low energy days and still have no appetite. What the heck????

                                                Within a few hours of receiving the vaccine, I started feeling nauseated. Since the day I took the vaccine, my appetite has been nonexistent. A day later, I felt very tired and confused. I received the vaccine on Monday and I woke up in a panic on Wednesday morning. My heart was racing, palms were sweaty, I felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe and it seemed like I was having a panic attack when I woke up. From that point forward, I fell into a deep depression. At first I didn&#39;t connect it with the vaccine, but I kept feeling nauseated and then wondered if it was connected. The depression became unbearable and I felt suicidal by the next week. I finally contacted my doctor&#39;s office and had a telemed visit where I explained that I had the J&amp;J vaccine the week before and these symptoms presented themselves afterward. The doctor put me on Zoloft and I HAVE been treated for depression in years past with that; however, I had not taken depression medication for about 8-10 years until this. Likewise, because my doctor put me on an anti-depressant, she also wanted me to see a counselor--which I have done. The medication is helping somewhat but I still don&#39;t have an appetite. I don&#39;t know if the vaccine had anything to do with the depression, but I wanted to report it just in case others have had similar symptoms.

                                                6-1/2 hours later:  Symptoms came on quickly.  Hands and feet felt frozen, chills, severe shoulder joint and muscle pain.    Immediately had to lay down and took Advil/Tylenol.  Could feel the movement of joint pain from shoulders to elbow, hips to knees.  Headache.  Couldn&#39;t navigate stairs safely.   In bed or on the couch for 24 hours until 6pm Friday 4/9/2021.      Three of us from the same company had the Janssen Vac within a day of each other and all 3 of us had the same adverse reaction.  To me, that is not mild symptoms when it debilitated me and kept me from going to work.    Most family members have had Pfizer with two shots and had NO side effects.

                                                I wasn&#39;t sure how to indicate which dose I&#39;m reporting on.  It&#39;s my second dose of a vaccine but my first of Johnson &amp; Johnson.  My first shot for Covid-19 was a Moderna shot, to which I had a bad reaction (immediate and prolonged lightheadedness reported already on this site).  My doctor advised me that my second dose should be a Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, as per information he had received from the CDC.  So, 28 days after the first shot I had the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.  I experienced the expected side effects of body aches, chills, headache--no big deal on day 2, but on day 3, I started some lightheadedness, as did my daughter who had the shot the same day.  Her lightheaded subsided the next day, but mine continued into day 4 and got worse when it became accompanied by pressure in my head/ears, and it felt like I was talking in a tunnel with echoing.  I couldn&#39;t function the rest of the day.  Today, the head pressure is not there, but the lightheadedness and shakiness are still there.  I hope I fully recover from these shots, but I don&#39;t have a lot of hope.

                                                2 weeks post inoculation developed burning sensation/tingling /pain from armpit to thumb; some tingling in thumb - sensation more like nerve pain vs muscle pain.  After two days gradually improved.  Muscle strength not affected, but movement in most directions elicited sharp pain coursing down arm.  Gradually improving to pain over the deltoid near injection site;  as of 19 days since initial pain motility much improved but still periodically throbs and sensitive to pressure and certain movements.   No treatment except restricting use of arm and time.  10 hrs post inoculation developed chills, myalgia and headache.  Chills and myalgia resolved in a few hours; an aspirin the next day resolved the headache.    This reaction was not unexpected.  Did not have pain at injection site until 2 weeks post injection.

                                                Beginning the following morning after my vaccination, at approximately 8:30 am, I began having severe stabbing chest pains. Feeling as though I was being stabbed dead center of my chest and it came out my back.  I had trouble breathing or felt like it hurt more when I tried to take a deep breath. This was very severe for about 2 hours then eased off  and was off and on for about two days. My arm did not get sore until the third day after my vaccination and remains sore still. I?ve experienced a headache in severity ranging from a nuisance to temple throbbing since the day after vaccination.  I have taken my naproxen for the chest pain and headache.  I ran a temp of 99-100 occasionally but never for a long period of time.  I?m still experiencing some chest pain  occasionally but nothing as severe as  the first two days.

She wanted me to take her  blood pressure and the machine would stop working after certain  inflation. The machine was working fine because tested on another person. I tried the other arm and same thing happened so, I advised patient to go to urgent care since she said she does not have a primary care physician.

By 8 hours after my vaccine I had impaired coordination, extreme fatigue, and it was laborious to walk. Muscle aches and a blinding headache overnight added to my misery. This morning the headache was painful not blinding and the muscle aches not as intense. Had to return to bed right after eating soup, due to weakness. Chills abated by this morning. Speech slowed this morning while talking on the phone. Have spent the day in bed resting&#34;  4/9/21: &#34;Voice was back to normal by 8:30 pm last night. Slept well overnight - no chills or headache. Feeling stronger this morning - no headache!!! Arm still aches, but that is nothing c

And the next morning after I woke up needing to use the restroom, got up but started feeling dizzy and fainted for about 2minutes.  EMT was called and once they arrived I began vomiting and my BP was super low. During the transport to the hospital I vomited again and was given antinausea meds.  At the ER I was given IV fluids, chest xray, EKG and blood was drawn and I was released after a few hours of monitoring

                                                I suddenly became very tired.  Almost immediately thereafter I got the chills and was shivering.  I had a fever of 100.4.  I took a 500mg acetaminophen tablet to prevent my fever from climbing.  I awoke the following morning with a headache and still a low-grade fever of 99.  I was feeling fine about noon except for being tired.  I continued to feel like I had low grade flu like symptoms. for the next couple of weeks.  This could have been related to DST beginning which is always a challenge for me. About 10 days later, the muscle in my right arm where I received my shot started to ache.  Perhaps it is because I slept on it wrong and that created the ache.  Now 5 weeks later I still feel some muscle ache in my arm, especially when I lift it over my head.

Note: I called Dr.&#39;s office to report my symptons to the nurse the day after my vaccine shot. I was not sure if it was due to new BP meds or vaccine shot. The nurse said it was hard to say. The nurse did increase my Lisinopril to 10MG 1/day per the doctors orders.

                                                Metallic taste in mouth 30 minutes after receiving vaccine. I have had a lot of stress (significant other diagnosed with Stage 4 inoperable NSCLC ) and had been attributing the often present headache to that, but they were also accompanied by a butterfly pattern red flush across my nose.  Acid reflux which I was attributing to stress or alendronate.  Woke in the night 4/12 to severe acid reflux, nausea, headache, flush, thought maybe I was having a heart attack (I have no cardiac/BP issues); then last night, 4/14 about 6 PM, weird numbness tingling in right arm from center of my chest  passed in about 5 minutes. Significant Other said I had the pattern flush on face at time of attack which faded as I began to feel better.  I have not consistently felt at 100% since vaccination, but I have a lot going on and attributed it to that.

Did not bother me except when flu-like symptoms flared up in the afternoon for 4 days. The rash then itched and stung a bit. I used a cannabis ointment on it for comfort. I still have a few small dried scabs from the rash.

                                                For the 1st 10 days it felt like my brain was swollen too big for my skull.  Not like any headache I have ever had.  I did take some acetaminophen but it didn?t seem to quell the pain.  While still at vaccine site I got a weird taste in my mouth, dry mouth and my voice started going hoarse.  I stayed a while longer to be watched as I also had itching.  I did not go into hives.  I had pain in my body from time of injection ? the ?typical? sore arm didn?t set in until day 3-4.  I had hot spots all over my body ? but not fever or rash.   On 4/11/21 I broke out into a rash on my forehead that lasted about 4 days.  What I want to specifically report is I like these zinger/sharp traveling pain from my temples to posterior head.  Still having this sensation but not as frequently.  They don?t last long but are noticeable at the time they are happening.  The only way I can explain the pain is that it felt like when you break a blood vessel in you finger and it really, really hurts for a short while and then pain subsides.  I started having these pin prick sensations within the first few days all over my body (arms, legs, back) but the frequency has decreased.  Days 2-6 I was just wiped out and rested.  I am still feeling lack of energy still today.

Over the next couple of days, became very ill, spent five days experiencing severe headache, disorientation, confusion, neck, shoulder, and back pain together with generalized arthralgias and myalgias. Around the 2nd week post-vaccination began to experience ?numbness and tingling? initially, affecting all fingers and toes; symptoms gradually evolved into ascending paresthesia affecting the upper and lower extremities. (worse in the upper extremities). Neurological symptoms are accompanied by painful electrical-like impulses running along my spine and elicited by flexing my neck (Lhermitte neurological phenomenon). Neurological signs and symptoms prompted me to go to the emergency room. Currently, I am under the care of a neurologist and undergoing extensive diagnostic workup.  Present treatment: Glucocorticoids (tapering) and Gabapentin. Among the initial rule out diagnosis, were transverse myelitis, and Guillain Barre. Present preliminary r/o diagnosis: Post-vaccine immune reaction ? No definitive diagnosis yet.

She reported these on 4/19/21. I advised her to contact her PCP to get evaluated for the signs/symptoms that she is experiencing to rule out anything severe. She did not seem to understand and asked to speak with the manufacturer. She said that she would contact the manufacturer and walked away.  When I attempted to contact her again today on 4/20/21, the phone number she provided to us has been disconnected and we have no means of reaching her at this point in time. I am hoping she heeded my advice and contacted her PCP to get evaluated.

                                                One hour after getting the vaccine,my face and neck swelled,but I had no breathing problems. Then 4 days after vaccine I experienced  a strange buzzing feeling in my brain,and Tinitus  ring in my ears,with sinus pressure. It lasted less than 10 minutes,and stopped. On the fifth day after vaccine,I noticed High Blood Pressure symptoms,and went to ER. On 8th day after vaccine,I I went to hospital for High Blood pressure again,and was put on medication!

On 02-APR-2021, the patient experienced clots on right leg. On APR-2021, a catheter was placed in catheterization procedure and her right leg vein was unclogged of a clot. A second clot did not require removal because the vein had already unclogged itself after medication. The patient was administered unspecified anticoagulants. She was discharged on 5-APR-2021 and was prescribed ticagrelor which was then changed to clopidogrel. On 18-APR-2021, the patient experienced a headache again and feeling of pressure on legs and hands. Patient was advised to visit ER.

This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This 64 year-old Hispanic or Latino female with history of high blood pressure and diabetes was hospitalized for clots in her right leg 13 days after receiving the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. Concomitant medications were not reported. On the day of her vaccination, she experienced a headache. Ten days later, she began to experience intermittent leg pain. Three days later (ie, 13 days post vaccination), she went to the emergency room (ER) and was admitted to the hospital. During the hospitalization, a clot was removed via catheterization and she was administered unspecified anticoagulants. A second clot resolved on its own without surgical intervention. After 6 days in the hospital, she was discharged with ticagrelor which was later changed to clopidogrel. She recovered from the clots. Thirteen days after discharge, she began to experience headache and &#34;pressure&#34; in both legs and hands. She was advised to go to the ER; no further information was provided. Based on the limited information, the relationship of the serious events with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine is considered indeterminant. Additional information is being sought.

                                                My initial symptoms were very minor and occurred the day after I received the vaccine: 99.5 degree fever and very mild headache. But several days later, both legs felt strangely weak from the calves to the feet. I also experienced occasional tingly feelings, pain, and often numbness. It was subtle at first but increased in intensity until April 21. I began to fear Guillain Barre syndrome. I scheduled a doctor&#39;s appointment for April 22, but the doctor&#39;s office cancelled and told me to go to the ER. At the ER bloodwork was done, which was normal. I was told to follow up with a neurologist if needed. It is now May 2 and my symptoms have slowly improved. It was frightening to have the symptoms for about a month. I was prepared to possibly feel unwell for several days, but expected neither my symptoms nor their duration.

                                                I started to get Migraines the day of the shot. I was nauseous and I did have seizure which only happens twice a year. My seizures are not always triggered by migraine. I have a history of hives and I get reactions to bites. I decided to get the Johnson &amp; Johnson because it seemed to be a better option. Ten days after the vaccine I had a Migraine that was so bad I had to go to the doctor. When I got there my blood pressure was high. I was given some migraine medicine, but it did not help. The migraine was there for four weeks after the shot. I still got a numbing headache after the shot until five weeks after the shot.

I was tested for Covid-19 and the test was negative. I had the cough for almost three weeks. I developed a weird bruise on my right forearm the size of a silver dollar. It was round and it took a couple of weeks to go away. My arthritis in my hands was also worse than normal for the three weeks.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA About 8 hours after the injection, I started having strong chills.  About 10 hours  after, I started having an incredibly fast heartbeat that lasted for about 10 hours. I tried some breathing exercises to bring it down, but that did not work.  I did not seek medical care as it went back to normal throughout the morning of the following day.  But kind of scary.  Also had a low temperature of 98 on the scanner thermometer.  Normal is 96 something.

I started having diarrhea about 5:30pm.  Later in the evening  around 8:30pm, I had more diarrhea.  Around the same time I became very, very sleepy and had extreme fatigue.  My right arm where I received the shot did not hurt and still does not hurt.  Around 6:00pm, my left arm starting hurting in the same spot where I received the vaccine in the right arm.   On the morning of 3/8/2021, I ate breakfast consisting of whole wheat bread and peanut butter and weak coffee (my usual breakfast) and had diarrhea again soon after eating.  At 3:30pm, I ate broiled, skinless chicken, green beans and small amount of instant mashed potatoes.  Around 5:00pm, I had diarrhea again.  I have been drinking a great deal of water on both 3/7/2021 and 3/8/2021 as I normally do every day.  At 6:30pm, I had more diarrhea.  Soon after, I took two imodium gelcaps and hoping they will help the diarrhea.  My left arm has become increasingly more sore and hurts in the muscle.  No other symptoms.

I started getting chilled but was very hot and feverish.  I went to bed around 10:00pm and had extreme body aches, shaking with chills and had a fever.  I took tylenol around 4am, when my temperature was 100.7.  The fever and aches subsided by the time I got up around 7am, but I was tired all day.  Took another tylenol around 1pm and started feeling normal, fine.  No other issues.

Woke up an hour later (9PM) with fever (100.5), HUGE migraine and being nauseous. I threw up, tried to go back to sleep but couldn&#39;t because of the migraine and fever. Decided to take 2 Tylenol, but I vomited about 20 mins later.  All night, I hardly could sleep at all, so sick I was feeling (and I&#39;m never sick!). No reaction at all on the site of the vaccine, no redness, no swelling at all. All day today (day after the vaccine), I have felt really weak, slightly feverish (though less than last night), with a persistent headache.

This has caused difficulty in taking a deep breath.  No congestion, coughing, or vomiting. Just pain with inhalation.  Pain can be palpated in ribs, level 6 and 7.  Somewhat better today, March 17.

                                                Patient reported that she experienced blurry vision one day after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, around 2:00 pm on 3/17/2021. She expressed concern that this might be related to the COVID-19 vaccine. She said it feels like there&#39;s something in her eye that&#39;s irritating it. I asked if she has seasonal allergies, and she said yes. She does not take anything for allergies. I advised her to try Visine eye drops. After consulting with Dr, I also advised her to take an over the counter antihistamine like Zyrtec, Allegra, or Claritin. Patient is diabetic, so we asked her to check her blood glucose as well. Patient reports that the Visine helped. Her blood sugar was 189. She reported chills and a mild fever. She took Tylenol and it brought her temperature down to of 99.6 F. I advised her to call me if any of her symptoms get worse or do not improve.

After drinking some ginger beer at 3 pm the nausea was gone by 3:30 pm.  Migraine gone by 7 pm and freezing cold feeling gone this morning (04/09/21).

I tried to go back to sleep. When I woke up, I took it easy. I did get the chills and sweats thru the day; skin turns really red (MCAS). That symptoms still comes and goes. The chills, regulating body temperature, has flared back up after being dormant for years.  3/30 I saw MD. She wanted to defer for 4-6 weeks after vaccination to see if symptoms were still persisting or leveling out.  I have since canceled every sort of appt since then as I don&#39;t have the energy.  *I am on the very tail end of an opioid withdrawal; tramadol. I have taken for 6 years, 400 mg weened down to 100 mg this last year, down to 12.5.

I had runny nose, low grade fever thinking it was seasonal allergies until April 5 when my temperatures was 102.  My Granddaughter tested positive on April 5 and so did her mother.  I immediately notified my Doctor that I was positive and his office immediately made arrangements for me to be given Monoclonal Antibody Therapeutics.  I was hospitalized January 2020 with shortness of breathe, pulse ox 72, temperature 104.  At that time I was told I had a virus of some kind but the Doctor in the hospital was not sure what kind.

Within a week I went to the ER and had a battery of tests; The only thing that showed up is that I was dehydrated after several hours of not drinking water. Normally, I drink about 64 oz. of water a day. The pain sometimes radiated to my neck. An x-ray showed arthritis. I have had occasional nausea.

I slept 4 hours past my normal time for getting up. I had no balance and would stagger when standing. My entire body was in muscle and nerve pain. Even my skin hurt. I took 300 mg of Gabapentine which eased my pain. I continued to be off balance the remainder of the day, however, by the end of the day I was much better. I took several 1 hour naps throughout the day.

                                                After roughly 4 hours I started to get chills and body aches. I went to bed but could not get warm and writhed in considerable distress for at least an hour. (This was the most uncomfortable I&#39;ve been since induced labor before the anesthesiologist arrived for an Epidural 28&#43; years ago.) My temperature fell to 95 before I took acetaminophen and was able to fall asleep.. Now, at 7 hours it&#39;s 101.2 and I&#39;m just getting the side effects I expected: weakness, a little nausea.

Around 3  am, I was nauseous and vomited, although there wasn&#39;t much actual vomit. I vomited again around 9 am the next morning, with even less vomit, since I hadn&#39;t eaten any breakfast. I rested most of Friday and ate sparingly. Today (Saturday) I feel better.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Approximately six hours after administration of the vaccine, patient experienced sever chills and dizziness. Unable to stop shaking, patient took temperature which registered at 95.4F and then 95.1F at 15 minutes. Patient donned flannel pants, thermal shirt, and oversized hooded sweatshirt and got in bed under flannel sheets, two doubled-over blankets, a bedspread, and quilt. A down-filled king-size pillow was placed on top of patient&#39;s torso and a space heater was turned on to highest setting. Patient reports heart seemed to be racing, but did not take BP. Unable to quell the chills, the patient continued to shake, developing very stiff shoulders, neck and back as a result. This continued until approximately 2 am. The next morning, patient&#39;s temperature was registering at 99.4F and pulse was 96, but patient did not report chills. General muscle aches and mild headache were noted. At time of this report, patient&#39;s temperature and pulse are normal (97.6F and 76 pulse).

(Right Axillary Node) Patient is retired healthcare worker. She said upon palpitation the node feels &#34;golf-ball&#34; sized. She stated it does seem to be shrinking in size by this morning. We felt it may be an important symptom to document due to her Lupus diagnosis and lack of studies in patients with this disease.

I hardly slept. (all these not worrisome to me) I&#39;m so glad my vaccine provider warned me that with underlying conditions, the vaccine could make them flare up. Which they did. In the morning I had widespread pain all over. Severe headache, and shortness of breath. Because I already have near emphysema hypoxemia oxygen levels, I checked my Oximeter and my blood oxygen was in the dangerously low 70&#39;s.  It stayed there until I put my oxygen concentrator on. Monitoring oxygen levels all day, I was able to keep it in the 80&#39;s to 90&#39;s, which helped.  40 hrs after injection , symptoms already fading away. All my adverse events were related to underlying conditions responding to the inflammation of the immune response. I feel  protected, glad I had the oxygen handy,  and I feel great about the  J &amp; J vaccine!

Later at night I had a low grade fever with achiness and headache. The flu like symptoms resolved by morning but I continue to have vertigo and intermittent nausea and my BP was still high in the morning around 9 am but came down by 12:45 to my normal range.  Paramedics at the site did a BP, pulse ox, blood sugar, ECG . Everything was normal except my BP which was 180/90.  This morning it was 167/98 and 168/97.  No treatment.  Saw my doctor&#39;s partner at 1:00 today and BP was back to my normal range but I still have mild vertigo and intermittent nausea.  Doc gave me some exercises to do for the vertigo and did not seem to think that it was related to the shot, but since the paramedics said they had seen a LOT of the same reaction yesterday to the J&amp;J shot and two sites in other cities shut down for the same reactions, nobody will convince me that it was anything but the shot. I expected the flu like side effects but never dreamed it would cause my  BP to spike and the vertigo.

                                                The shot was painful but that wasn?t unexpected. I immediately felt woozy after the shot but thankfully I had brought a cold full sugar ginger ale and started drinking it. My sensation was kind of like a low blood sugar event where a soda can help. I was not surprised to feel this way and felt somewhat reluctant to report this as I didn?t really think it was unusual. and I didn?t report  it at the time. The shot was at a drive up event at a University.. After chugging the ginger ale I felt a bit better and was given the  ok to leave after 15 minutes. Back at work, I felt  better but still just a bit  ? off?.  But this passed in an hour and I was good the rest of the day. For a few days afterwards  I had a mild headache but no other real symptoms.  My usual  blood pressure under medications is 116/72.  It could be possible that the shot caused some lower blood pressure immediately or within the hour  after the shot?  Or perhaps the effect was low blood sugar for which the ginger ale helped.

On Sat March 27 about noon I got another headache, this one much worse.  Eventually took 2000 mg  Tylenol, no relief.  Headache was so severe my husband wanted to take me to ER.  I did not think they could do anything so did not go.  Severe headache lasted until late evening/overnight.  Sunday I was fine, nothing since.

                                                HPI Details: a 66-year-old female presenting today for evaluation of high blood pressure.  Patient notes that she went to the dentist on March 24 and was having a root canal revised.  She was told that she had very elevated blood pressure at that time, 173/81.  When they rechecked her blood pressure it had gone up even higher.  She was not feeling necessarily bad at that time but did start noticed that she was having some pounding headaches and felt like her heart was pounding out of her chest.  She has not really changed activity or diet.  She is not on any new supplements or over-the-counter meds that would cause this.  The only thing different was that she did receive the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine just prior to onset of this.  Patient was concerned about her blood pressure running so high, and she is a physician so she did prescribe herself some atenolol.  She took a couple of doses of this on March 29 when she received her blood pressure cuff in the mail from online store and was checking her blood pressure and found that her numbers were running quite high, such as 207/107.  She contacted our office.  I did go ahead and start her on lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily.  This did not make a significant improvement in her blood pressure.  We did go ahead and get lab work done.  CBC was unremarkable.  CMP notable for potassium 3.3 and alk phos minimally elevated at 129.  TSH was within normal limits.  Patient does bring in a log of her blood pressures with her today.  Again these are not really improving significantly with the lisinopril 10 mg daily.

We called the emergency services when they arrived she had collapsed. They broke the window and took her to the hospital, upon arrival we were informed that she has got a hemorrhage possible clotting due to high blood pressure. I now know the term is Cerebral Hemorrhage, she has been in ICU on a ventilation machine while they tried to drain the blood and clots. She&#39;s currently out of ICU however still complains about headache and back pain. We are informed that she has now developed some blood pressure and diabetes however it could be cleared in the short term. She&#39;s at the hospital and unknown how long she would have to stay there.

Per interpretor, patient woke up feeling at baseline yesterday morning, when she had her COVID-19 vaccine. Yesterday around dinner time, she began having issues with vision in her right eye, causing her visual field in that eye to appear dark to her entire right eye. She told her husband that she thought she might have a hair or eyelash in her right eye and that she had an irritating pain radiating from her right eye to the right side of her face. Even after washing her eye with cold water, the sensation did not subside. At approximately 3-4 AM this morning, she also began to experience pain to the back of her head and neck bilaterally. This morning, the visual impairment improved from the entire visual field to now only just the inferior aspect of the right eye. However, she denies weakness to any of her extremities. Patient also denies chest pain, numbness, abdominal pain or nausea. She was seen at ophthalmology, at which Dr. diagnosed her with a right retinal branch arterial occlusion and decided to send her to SHE to be evaluated for the possibility of a CVA. She denies being on blood thinners or taking Aspirin. She denies any previous diagnosis of a CVA or TIA.

                                                About three hours after the vaccination, after eating a light dinner of two pieces of pizza and drinking a beer (to celebrate,  I thought) (an identical dinner to my husband, who was vaccinated minutes after me, and who suffered no adverse effects) I suddenly had extreme nausea and, immediately, projectile vomiting. My entire stomach emptied, but I continued to retch for the entire night and into the next day, weak and nauseated for about 72 hours. I became dehydrated but couldn&#39;t keep water down for 48 hours.   That first night, I experienced body temperature swings, whole body pain (not muscle aches, and not localized) and most disturbingly, hallucinations.  I awoke in the middle of the night convinced that my body had stretched in length  and there were two of me.  This was similar to the reaction I had to opiodes, but even worse (I didn&#39;t think anything could be worse).

At the same time,   large bruises appeared on the &#34;shot arm&#34; from the shoulder down almost to my elbow. Soreness in my right calf developed after four weeks and still comes at times.

                                                Immediately upon receiving the shot I had a severe headache in the back of my head and in my upper back. It reminded me of the pain I had with the TIA several years ago. I told the pharmacist that gave me the shot and she said that it was something she had not seen before so quickly sat there for 30 minutes. The pain continued but was not quite as severe. I left with my son and almost when to the hospital but decided to come home and monitor. It lasted three days and I still get random pains there in the back of my head. I suffer from anxiety so I had thought at the time that it possibly could have been nerves. But now in light of the reported cases of blood clots and the fact that I have had at least one TIA...maybe two, I thought that I should report this incident. It was an immediate severe pain!!

A chest x-ray was done which demonstrated ground glass opacities. My breathing was also bad. I also have an enlarged heart.  I also do not have any blood clots. I did not have problems before the J&amp;J vaccine. To this day I still have headaches that come and go.  I do not know if the J&amp;J vaccine attributed to my symptoms and my doctor is till monitoring me.

                                                15-20 minutes after the injection, I started feeling a tightness in back of my throat; I broke out in cold sweat. I started getting dizzy and very whoozy. I felt my vision starting to close in. I thought I was going to pass out. I got the attention of the person across me to get an attendant and they brought me a chair with wheels. Two people got me up (and I&#39;m not a big person) - they were worried I was going down and I was taken to exam room. They said I was white as a sheet. She checked my eyes and throat a few times and checked my blood pressure. It was lower than normal but she didn&#39;t seem really concerned about it - 104 over 60 something which is low for me. She gave me water to sip. She gave me very cold compresses to put on my forehead. They watched me pretty good. She had the epi-pen ready. She watched me and I sat in there and nurse came in a quite a few times to check me for about an hour. About an hour later the tightness went away and I started feeling myself again. We went home. I went to sleep. I woke up at night to go to bathroom and I was still a little woozy but I didn&#39;t fall. Next day, I just didn&#39;t feel well. My left arm was starting to hurt - was no swelling; it was a little red at injection site. It hurt just a little. I was woozy. My eyes couldn&#39;t focus as well. I felt out of it. I drank a lot of water and took a nap.  Yesterday, I felt pretty decent but still woozy somewhat. I tried to run errands with my husband  - just wasn&#39;t quite right. Today, much better but I&#39;m not quite myself yet. Just a little wooziness - weird feeling. Yesterday, I did feel a soreness in the back of my right calf muscle. It wasn&#39;t warm to the touch or swollen. I don&#39;t have it anymore, it went away.  It could have been a muscle thing from the first day of the vaccine when I got home and I got up and almost fell down. I do still have some achiness in joints. Especially in my knees - which isn&#39;t normal because they are replaced.

The next day, bigger lump, swollen, all just below injection and red, moderate chills, a bit itchy, nausea., and painful. Same on 3rd day but much bigger redness spreading down arm, 2 1/2 by 2 1/2&#39; hard mass and red, itchy, painful, chills and nausea. Next morning called Dr. I am taking amoxicillin-clav 875-125ng tab.  Three days later mass is turning from red to pink and retreating. Still hurts  and now bruses show around the injection site, which I thought was strange. The vaccine actually hurt when given (I get injections every three months, so I know what they will feel like, but this hurt and went very deeply and then burned). I felt warm afterwards for about 10 minutes.

She was reporting soreness with pulsating pain for the first 2 to 3 days, now reports a constant dull and achy pain that is worse with activity and movement.  She has been using Tylenol, which she reports does help reduce pain symptoms.  She denies any reduction in her range of motion, but states pain symptoms are more prominent with movement.  She is also reporting daily headaches that occurred starting the day after getting the vaccine.  Patient reports headache is bilateral in nature with a dull, aching quality.  She states headache starts within 10 to 20 minutes of waking up.  She takes Tylenol to help with headache symptoms, which does seem to relieve the headache.  Some days, she reports headache comes back in the afternoon or evening.  She denies any nasal congestion, vision problems, tinnitus, postnasal drip or sinus pressure. No balance, near syncopal, or syncopal problems. Denies any sensory or motor impairment accompanying the headaches.

I went to the Dr. because it sacred me, she gave me antibiotics , cough medicine with codeine- I couldn&#39;t stop coughing.  I asked her to change my nebulizer treatment because it wasn&#39;t working.  The Dr. suspected that this would happen.

                                                On day 11 post shot I started to feel mildly nauseated. Next day nausea increased, as did muscle aches and pain - by early evening I had repeated bouts of uncontrollable vomiting and uncontrollable diarrhea [no cramps, no warning] that lasted most of the night.  I did have a fever briefly - got all red and felt like I was on fire - but that passed pretty quickly while the rest continued.   I had to stay up all night, any attempt to lie down triggered more vomiting.  By 3 in the morning I was ?on empty? and by 6 am could lie down.  Nausea took three more days to leave completely.  Muscle pain is resolving, almost gone.  I am resuming my meds [everything that went down before came right back up].  The only tummy pain was after hours of vomiting [muscle strain].   Today is the 25th and I?m still tired and a bit foggy but otherwise feel better.  I had a call with my doctor about this and she said I should report it so that?s what I?m doing.

                                                Prior to vaccination, the patient stated that she was nervous, but seemed relieved and okay directly following the vaccination.  Following vaccination, patient became restless during the 15 minute post-vaccination window about 2-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  She initially presented with uncontrollable shaking/bouncing legs, palpitation, sweating, and shortness of breath (though this was very brief.   Patient remained coherent and oriented to time/person/place.   The shaking and palpitations subsided after a couple minutes and resumed towards the end of the 15 minute waiting period, accompanied by nausea.  25 minutes post-vaccination she appeared to have stabilized, and we assisted the patient to her room nearby at her request to allow her to lie down while being monitored.  After returning to her room, she very quickly ran to her sink due to her nausea, then after a minute of attempting to vomit, she collapsed and appeared to have briefly lost consciousness.  EMS was called and the patient was rolled onto her side to prevent choking in the event of emesis.  Patient remained responsive, but was weak and clammy with a weak pulse and breathing.  After the firefighters came, a search of the apartment found the previously listed medications.  Additionally, the patient experienced a seizure-like episode lasting 15 seconds in duration.  Once the EMT came, they assessed her and monitored her in the ambulance; they reported that her condition appeared stable, her vitals were strong, and transported her to Hospital for observation/testing.

                                                Heart rate increased within 5 minutes of having the shot, went from 72 to 114.   My heart rate stayed at 109 or more until 10 PM the next night when its slowly went down to a normal heart rate.  At 3 am  (12 hours after the shot) i had  a blinding debilitating headache that lasted until 9pm the next night.   It also affected my vision.   The headache was so bad i could not concentrate on the simplest task.  I  was unsure of what i could take for the headache.   So, I did not take anything.    When i woke up i was very tired and this lasted until the following day.  6am i had a fever of 102.3 this went down to 100.4 at 9:15 pm that night.  I also had chills for several hours. 9:20 AM  the nausea started followed by vomiting and dizziness.   This only lasted for a few hours.    I  experienced very vivid dreams the night of the shot.    I only drank some coconut water all day and could not eat any food.  The next day Saturday March 27 i felt better but the fatigue did not go away until late in the evening.   Sleeping seemed to help but i could only sleep for 2- 3 hours at the most.

She felt well enough to leave the pharmacy on her own after 25-30 minutes.  The  patient had a prior history of anxiety prior to receiving vaccinations and was very nervous about getting the vaccination prior to administration.  The patients daughter was with her and felt that her symptoms were due to anxiety about  getting vaccinated, but later called the pharmacy asking to report the adverse events as being related to receiving the vaccine.  It is not known weather or not the symptoms are directly related to the vaccine.

                                                About one week after my injection, I had severe cramping in left leg. On April 5th started with a couple of days with severe pain in tendons of right shoulder. The pain referred into the right neck and base of occiput. On April 7, 2021, I felt off then developed a severe, stabbing headache over my right eye referring back into the occiput.  Was not steady on my feet. Did not eat dinner, went to bed.  Felt tingling around my mouth, and my neck and shoulders were very tight.  I debated about going to the hospital, but decided against it.  Still have tightness on the right side of my neck into the occiput and right shoulder.

                                                Jansen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the vaccination on 3/12/2021, about 8:30AM, at Fairgrounds. I needed the J&amp;J vaccine, one Moderna or Pfizer as I have a history of anaphylaxis. County Public Health received about 200 does of the J&amp;J and 800 of Moderna and Pfizer.   I waited at the vaccine site about 40 minutes after the vaccine. I went home, ate, read, and became unusually sleepy so took a nap. I woke up about 2:00PM and noticed my lips and tongue were swollen, and sore. I took 2 Benadryl. The Benadryl seems to have worked as expected. I will take 2 more when I go to bed, about 11:00.  I&#39;m unusually sleepy, and my joints ache. Overall, however, I think I am experiencing a very mild reaction and I&#39;m thankful for the vaccine. I sent my doctor a message through the patient portal, telling him of the reaction. His office is closed so he will get the message on Monday.

                                                On MON evening after the shot, at 11:00pm I experience severe chills that lasted for hours. Tuesday morning I awoke with a bad headache and had body aches all day as well as tendonitis- like pain in both lower arms. I felt somewhat better on WED but I did notice that my compression sleeve on my right arm (lymphedema arm) felt more snug than usual. That night I had severe chills and fever of 101. I slept until 11:45am on THU and felt aches all over. Very fatigued. Went back to sleep from 2:00pm until 6:00pm. Temp was down to 99.8.  When I woke and removed my compression garment, my arm was red and swollen, also rash-like bumps, and was very warm to the touch. FRI morning it looked worse, so I contacted my lymphedema specialist and then my PCP. This is NOT a good situation for anyone who has lymphedema and will necessitate months of treatment.

Went to Urgent Care on 3/12/21.  Gave me an albuterol inhaler which was not effective in relieving symptoms.  I wasn&#39;t improving, so went to emergency room at the hospital on 03/18/2021.  I was admitted to hospital and placed on oxygen and kept overnight.  I was also given Xarelto.  I am at home and on Xarelto.

After she received the shot her leg and shoulder pain/ache increased to an 8/10 (usually a 2-4/10) and was constant when it usually is intermittent.  Her breathing is worse and she is maxing out her inhalers and needing many more doses of her rescue morphine than usual (usually 2.4 ml of 20mg/ml Roxanol used in a week and last week was 7.5ml).  She has not been taking it for the pain for fear of med interactions.  She has increased her Tylenol use from 500mg qd to 3000mg qd.  Her tremors are worse and she is taking her propranolol for tremors 20mg BID instead of her usual 10mg BID.  Her body sweats have gone from 1 time a week to 1-2 times a day.  No fevers noted.

                                                I&#39;m not sure this is even a &#34;reportable event&#34;!  I have had mild tinnitus for several years, generally not noticeable except in extremely quiet settings. But 2 days after receiving J&amp;J vaccine - (the day on which I felt the most &#34;fatigued&#34; and experienced some muscle aches, which responded well to ibuprofen) - I awoke with several episodes of loud ringing in my ears.  From that time until now, my continuous tinnitus is much louder than it had been.  I keep hoping it will subside!  It&#39;s more frustrating and annoying than anything else. No pain or discomfort. For this reason I have held off seeking medical treatment.  It seems like more than a coincidence to me, so I felt I should probably at least try to report it.

Was able to take this medication on 4/9 when I felt another migraine coming on.  It worked.  The migraines on 4/4, 4/6, and 4/8 began with an aura which lasted more than an hour.  The headaches were so severe that on 4/8 I had my son stay the night.  I never experienced such intense pain in the past.  I do have a history of migraines, but had not had one since 2016.  Typically, I would get the aura, lay down and close my eyes, and then the aura would diminish in 15 - 30 minutes.  I never get a headache with the auras.

A heating pad helped but continued after removing it.  I also had a slight stomach ache.  The next day, I felt i had less energy  than normal, lethargic.

                                                Johnson and Johnson Janssen COVID-19 EUA vaccine  At the time of the injection, the vaccine burned as it entered my arm. (I have never felt that burning sensation with any other vaccination that I have had in the past. Twenty minutes after the vaccination, I became lightheaded and dizzy.  I could walk but I was wobbly. At one hour after the vaccination, I felt a sharp stabbing pain in the left side of my tongue and then the left side and only the left side of my tongue began to go numb. Within a couple of minutes, I realized that my left jaw was going numb, too.  The numbness slowly but surely began to move up the left side of my face all the way to the top of my head.  I had a sharp but brief headache on the left side of my head  that subsided quickly but the numbness remained.  I went home and talked to two people on the phone for several hours because they wanted to be sure that I was OK. At two hours after the vaccination, my face was still numb but I could think and talk clearly, but I was clearing my throat and coughing a lot.  At that point, I also realized that my whole left arm was a little numb and my fingers on my left hand were tingling.  That numbness lasted about 20 minutes and then subsided. The facial numbness lasted for hours.  I wasn&#39;t scared and I wasn&#39;t in pain but it was very strange.  It felt a little bit like the after affects of dental anesthesia but it wasn&#39;t just in my mouth it was the whole left side of my face.   I believe that this must have been an allergic reaction to one of the chemicals in the vaccine but I don&#39;t know which one.  If you can tell me which chemical it might have been, I will avoid it in the future.

I could not get warm, even with a heated blanket.  It finally subsided a little after midnight and I could sleep, waking every hour.   My body was very achy, and I felt exhausted.   I was very nauseous too.  The next day, Sunday, my body still ached and I felt weak, like recovering from the flu.  Today, Monday, I feel fine.    I did not call my doctor.

                                                Six hours after the shot I began to shake. I was not cold and my temp was only 99 degrees. The shaking turned into uncontrollable jerking of my shoulders, torso and thighs. The jerking lasted 3 hours. My family became concerned and said I looked like I was convulsing. We were making plans to go to the ER when it started to calm down. I had no control over my body. I finally stood up and my body felt like I was made of led. Headache, slight fever, and weakness persisted until 48 hours post shot.

                                                Approximately 21 days after receiving vaccine I started to have symptoms of what was later diagnosed to be shingles.  My skin was very sensitive to even wearing clothes and I thought I had bites on the back of my neck into my hairline because we had been on Nantucket.  But I could not see it.  I was feeling very fatigued and had pain from my left ear down my left arm and side.   I did not think it could be shingles because  I received the Shingrix vaccines in 2019.  Finally I had my husband take a picture of it and sent it to me PCP ON 4/8/2021.  She informed me it was shingles and put me on a prescription (not sure of name for 1 week).  Because nerve pain in neck and ear still continues I was prescribed Gabapentin which I am still taking.

                                                Ten hours after vaccination into my left arm, my right arm, right leg, and right hip bones felt as if they were being crushed.  I finally fell asleep for an hour or two, then awaken just in time to make it to the bathroom where I sat on the toilet ALL night having severe diarrhea and vomiting into a container on my lap.   I would fall asleep, then wake up, on the toilet, very sick.    The vomiting ended after that first night, but the diarrhea has persisted.  It is getting better, though. (It has been 72 hours since the shot.)  I had a headache, my left arm ached, I was nauseous, and feverish until about 8 a.m., today, when my fever broke.  I still feel like I have a low-grade flu, which I have not had in over 40 years.  And, I still have some diarrhea.  I am sipping Coke and can eat some Cheerios, with milk and banana, but that is all that I want to attempt.

Took my temperature and it was 97.1 (my temp is usually in the mid 97&#39;s).  Weak and tired.  Took Tylenol about 7:30 pm - it helped a little but still felt freezing cold.  Went to bed and next morning felt better but wrung out.

I woke my husband and asked him to take my temperature - I had no fever.  I then asked him to call 911 to ask if my symptom was typical of the vaccine.  They sent paramedics to my house and before they arrived I started feeling better so there was no treatment performed.  The whole bad episode lasted 10-15 minutes and I felt like I was going to die.  It was not repeated.

Neck muscles &amp; jaw muscles hurt. Dressed in polar fleece jammies, socks, flannel bed-sheets, two heavy duvets &amp; couldn&#39;t get warm nor stop the shaking. Tried standing to walk it off but legs were like jelly.  Tried bio-feedback to relax &amp; stop the shivering but it just continued in wave after wave. My chest tingled and my heart felt like it was working hard. It subsided around 4:30a.m. The next day felt &#39;punk&#39; muscles still jelly like &amp; jaw really ached from chattering. The 2nd day was fine.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included minor low pressure glaucoma, blood pressure, mild asthma, augmentin allergy, non alcoholic, non-smoker, and pre-diabetic.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805018, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 17-MAR-2021 10:00 on left arm for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 17-MAR-2021, Patient stated that the shot hurt so bad not like any other shot she had before, she felt nauseous right on the spot. When she went home, she felt tired, weak and had headache, stomach cramps and her face was tingly but not red. At around 9 or 10 PM, She felt cold, had shiver, diarrhea, chills, and a fever of 100.8 F max. Her arm felt sore and looked bruised so she took Tylenol. By 21-MAR-2021, she had minor symptoms but fever went away, her arm was sore and she had diarrhea. Her symptoms completely resolved by 25-MAR-2021. On 08-APR-2021, patient went to see her Ophthalmologist to follow up on her minor low pressure Glaucoma and Dr. told her she had an Optic Nerve Damage. Dr. told her that her eye pressure is 10 or 11 and it did not make sense that her pressure was low but she had an optic nerve damage. Ophthalmologist suggested that this could be because her oxygen level was low or she had sleep apnea but patient regularly checked her oxygen (always around 98) and did not had sleep apnea. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from diarrhea, bruised arm, tingly face, stomach cramps, shivering/chills/felt cold, sore arm, weakness, nauseous right on the spot, tiredness, headache, and fever on 25-MAR-2021, and the outcome of optic nerve damage was not reported.

Approximately 10 minutes after injection, I began to sweat profusely, followed by intensifying extreme lightheadedness. I could not stand, or lift my head, as I would have definitely passed out.  My shoulders and neck became extremely painful, as if ?frozen?, also preventing me from lifting my head.  After about 35 minutes I very gradually began to recover. It was about an hour before I began to move around normally.   Pharmacy and store staff  debated calling the paramedics, but I refused.  FYI, I had not been especially anxious about the vaccine, and I have never experienced such a reaction to anything in my life. It was a traumatic experience I would not wish to repeat.

                                                First night had chills, very slight nausea and low grade fever (99.3) the next two days.  On the morning of April 7th I woke up with a swollen lip.  Throughout the day the swelling continued on the left side of face, then on bottom of right foot and later on top of both feet.  Went to emergency room and was treated for hives.  Over the next five days, the hives kept moving around, the right side of face, and then to upper lip.  I followed up with my Primary Care Doctor, who did extensive allergy testing.  All came back negative.  I felt that it was a result of my body reacting to the vaccine.  In addition, I was feeling weak muscles and joints that kept moving around.

I had to be taken by ambulance to the hospital on 4/17/2021 - I thought I was having a stroke. They said that I had developed bells palsy on the right side of my face. They gave me medication to use for one week. The symptoms that I was having went away less than two weeks later. They told me that Bells Palsy symptoms could last two weeks to six months. It&#39;s gone right now - I don&#39;t see any symptoms of it.  I did have a virtual appt appt with my doctor -

Body aches and stiffness, affected my walking.  Did not take temperature at that time.  Got back into bed with 2 blankets and a comforter and still couldn&#39;t sleep.  Got up a 7AM - temp 102.2, shaking less but still  feeling cold, body was hot to touch.  I had a bad headache and body aches and stiffness were still there. I noticed at that time  that I had a bright red flush on both cheeks and my nose that was hot to the touch.  Took 600mg of Ibuprofen.  Went back to bed feeling terrible.  At 12 noon I got back up and temp was down to 99.7.  Headache, body aches, stiffness, and &#34;red flush&#34; still on cheeks and nose.  Went back to bed.  Took more Ibuprofen at 7pm - temp was down to 98.7.  Headache was better, body aches improved.  Flushed hot face was still present.  Went to  sleep at 11:30PM  and slept for 10 hours.  Today, 03/06/21, all symptoms improved, no fever, redness of face is still present but less.

                                                about two hours after injection,  I experienced headache,  then mild dizziness,  then extreme dizziness,  then sudden overwhelming fatigue,  then swollen eyes and eyelids,  then chills and elevated heart rate,  with pounding.    I had to cancel the class I was supposed to teach,  because I would not have been safe to drive to campus.  I slept from approximately 2:30 pm on March 8 until 8:30 am today,  March 9,   all symptoms continuing,  with bathroom breaks, a couple of short reports to family members who were watching out for me,  and one  2-hour window during which I ate a small meal,  went back to bed,  and read part of a book.    During bathroom breaks I took more antronex,  some milk thistle,  and some glutathione,  which seemed to at least temporarily reduce dizziness and eye/eyelid swelling.  At one point I took some hawthorne tincture because I was concerned about the heart pounding.    Today I woke up feeling symptom-free,  but by 2 pm I was compelled by sudden fatigue to take a two-hour nap.   After that I felt better,  and I think I am now fine,  at 7:45 pm on 3/9/21.    I am happy to have gotten the Janssen vaccine,  because it is one and done!

I could not go up and down steps as my legs would not hold me. Headache.  Week 2 to present. Fatigue, I have to nap every day and I sleep 8 hours or more at night.  Diarrhea, despite taking OTC medications  to control. Dehydration and dizziness. I am now 4 weeks since my shot on March 4th and I continue to have these symptoms.   I went to see my doctor and all lab tests are normal. There is no other diagnose reason for my continued symptoms. I wish I waited to get either the Pfizer shot or Moderna as I have not heard of these extreme and prolonged side effects from those shots.

                                                Noon the day after the vaccine I was suddenly overcome with nausea, and dizziness that sent me stumbling to bed and vomiting into a bucket next to me. Vomiting lasted for one session, but dizziness and nausea stayed for about 3 hours, and then nausea, fatigue and general sick feeling kept me in bed until the next day. April 9 I woke up still feeling out of sorts, but not as bad. Note: 28 minutes after having the vaccine, once I started driving home, the vision in my left eye suddenly went blurry, and I nearly lost vision in that eye. I tried to find a safe place to pull over but couldn&#39;t. After 5-8 minutes the vision came back but stayed a bit blurry for a couple hours. Never had any such thing happen before.

I woke up (Wed.) with  NAUSEA and took the &#34;anti-nausea&#34; pills that I had left over from when I had COVID (11 - 2020).  My upper arm was now very sore, especially when I tried to lift it.  I took my temp. and I had a FEVER (101). On Thurs., my temp. went down to 99.5 and the nausea was gone.  Today (Fri.), I woke up with pain on my shoulder (over the injection site). I took Advil and iced it and it is now much better (this eve.). The only side effect I have now is the pain in my arm (mostly when I lift it). I am eating better and sleeping better now.

Next, reported feeling strange, shaky.  Leaned forward with head low.  Instant cold pack was placed on back of neck.   Over next five to ten minutes patient&#39;s anxiety increased, as did shakiness.  Blood pressure readings were taken and elevated, as was heartrate, but not at hypertensive crisis.  Patient could breathe and speak.  She contacted someone to assist her with leaving, but when the ETA seemed too long, she agreed to have us contact EMS.  Her condition seemed to improve and decline several times before assistance arrived.  She expressed concern about the elevated BP readings.  A second cool pack was administered until she next reported feeling cold and chilly, with shakiness.  She mentioned that her abdomen also felt cold, which was strange.  EMS arrived and transported patient approximately 30 minutes post administration.

The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE) (suspension for injection, route of administration was not reported, batch number: 1808978 and expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total, administered on 30-MAR-2021 to right deltoid for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 30-MAR-2021, following vaccination, the patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation almost every day unlike the time before vaccination and her heartbeat sped up and then slowed down (irregular heartbeat). On the same day, the patient experienced brain fog, fever (axillary temperature of up to 100 degrees) and headache. Since the vaccination, the patient&#39;s nausea worsened. On 31-MAR-2021, the patient experienced stomach aches and generalized body pain.

I had the chills very badly  I sleep with an electric blanket, but I had not had chills in years. I was very sore and cold, but did not do anything until 4:00am. I went and got an expired prescription of oxycontin. I took 2 and went back to bed. I woke up at 6 and was fine. So it lasted maybe 4 hours.

BP 199/88 and continued to rise over the course of 15 minutes to 239/103. Pt denied shortness of breath, but tingling did not improve so Benadryl 50mg PO adminsitered but offered minimal relief. Pt then began to complain of blurry vision to left eye and headache. EMS called and manual BP was 258/100. Pt transported to local ED and treated. ED physician noted that he felt that this was a drug reaction related to the COVID vaccine.

Medicated with Tylenol, bananas, oatmeal and herbal tea.  Documented on pdf form, but unable to use &#34;continuation page&#34;, so added sheet that unable to attach.  Will try again to upload and send separately to this.  NO forms given to me at pharmacy for reporting anything.  I called several times and left messages, but no return call.  Sent email, but response saying unable to help at this time.  Very frustrating as I continued having severe symptoms and unable to get help.  Finally feeling better enough today to send form.

                                                Around 5:30 pm on Friday night, I started feeling really cold; couldn&#39;t get warm for 2 hours. Then I started getting a fast heart rate; checked this around 7 pm; BP was 181/80 and heart rate was 135.  I was starting to feel warm along with being cold.  I had a gradually increasing temperature; checked it around 8:30 pm; was 102.1; took 2 tylenol and temperature slowly started going down.  My heart would not slow down; I sat in my recliner and kept deep breathing and had calming herbal tea; was afraid to go to the ER due to Covid.  After more than 4 hours with a racing heart, I felt exhausted and laid down around 12:30 a.m. and fell asleep.  I woke around 3 am with nausea and soaking wet pajamas from sweating.  I fell asleep again and woke around 7 am; I felt very tired, woozy and my heart hurt.  I felt a bit more normal after a few days.  I still feel a bit dizzy and light headed.  I was concerned when I later heard some J&amp;J vaccines were contaminated; on 4/2/21, I called the pharmacy because the number they wrote on my card, 1805D18 wasn&#39;t clear; they told me this # was incorrect and should be 037A21B and couldn&#39;t explain why this was so. They were going to check into  this and call me; I called them again on 4/5/21 and was told the correct # was 043A21A and that the vaccine was from the Netherlands.  They couldn&#39;t offer any more information or explain why the initial # was incorrect. I find this concerning and have been unable to find an answer.

Massive headache by Monday and ringing in ears.  Took Naproxin and Mucinex Monday morning before going to work.  At the end of the day I took Naproxin and Mucinex in order to sleep.  By Tuesday I had chest congestion which has gotten only worse along with needle-like pain in the chest upon coughing. I spit up yellow phlegm, tiredness behind eyes returned, sneezing, choking on phlegm, and constant runny nose and ringing in ears.  This has made working difficult, but not impossible.  Please ignore if these are normal reactions.  I&#39;m just not sure.

After that time she has noticed a worsening of the fatigue and &#39;tiredness&#39; to the point that she can no longer perform normal activities.  She states that she is normally very active and enjoys activities like cutting the grass and other outdoor chores.  But for the last 10 days or so she has been unable to do those things and finds herself falling back asleep during the day.  She says this overwhelming feeling of tiredness seems to be getting worse.  I suggested she visit her doctor for bloodwork and she said she would do so.

                                                I received vaccine at 2:00 PM on 3/10//2021.  I was tired afterwards.  By 11:00 that same night I felt nauseous, has a headache and every joint and muscle  in my body was painful.  I could not sleep or get into a position where I was comfortable.   The pain level was a 10.   I took Tylenol in the middle of the night but it did not help.  In the morning I was unable to contact my physician&#39;s nurse so I called the 24 hour Nurse Line.  The nurse took all my information and told me that I could take Ibuprofen.  I took 400 mg. and found a lot of relief from that.  I still had some symptoms for the next few days.  By 3/14/21 I felt fine.  Now today I have a stuffy nose which could be an allergy to something else.  I don&#39;t know yet.

Can&#39;t sleep due to EXTREMELY loud ringing in both ears.  Difficulty performing everyday tasks.  I know of no other adverse event that occurred at this time other than vaccination.  Visited primary care physician on April 8, 2021.  She could not say for certain why I have these sudden ear symptoms.  She wants me to monitor for 2-3 weeks.

At the same time it felt like my head (in notch immediately forward of middle of ear to ear)  was in a tightening vise.  Then I got hot and cold  but not severely.  Same for dizziness, very mild. I was nasusseous and not able to eat.  I had random muscles pains , none lasting more than a few minutes in any one place. Odd thing was that I felt no discomfort at sight of injection. Next day I felt just as bad but at 8:30pm I felt like throwing up (after having 2 teaspons of vegetarian vegetable soup). However, I only had dry heaves. I live by myself and started to get scared. I called my daughter and took a Tylenol at 9pm. Within 10 minutes the feeling of a vise and my aching teeth felt significantly better. but  stil very fatigued. Next day, today,  I feel much better but still a little foggy headed. I can eat. I can function normally, thank heavens. If I had to take another shot now, I wouldn&#39;t. Not even sure I&#39;ll take a booster when it comes out . It was very scarey.

                                                The day after the vaccination i had aches and chills, lasted about 24 hours and then went away completely.  About a week after the vaccination i started to get pains in my joints and bones, especially the left elbow.  I also had a swollen underarm gland in the left armpit.   Now over a month later the swelling has gone away but I still feel achy at times.  Recently, I have been experiencing a fatigue and real tiredness that prevents me from being as active as I had been.  Not sure it is from the vaccine or my diuretic or my blood pressure medication, but I have been on those about one year with no problem.  I am wondering if it is the vaccine.  I never had joint pains prior to the vaccine.

                                                Patient was seen in our ER on 3/8. She stated that she had received her Johnson/Johnson COVID Vaccine on Thursday (3/4/21) and since then, had been experiencing body aches, chills, fever, fatigue, headache, n/v/d. She was admitted for treatment with IV fluids and supportive meds for the n/v/d. On 3/9, she was still feeling very ill. Fever and chills had improved but she was still not tolerating PO. BP was also elevated ranging from 142/82 to 206/80. She was also diagnosed with AKI. BUN was 51, Cr 3.26. By 3/11, she was feeling a little better but kidney function continued to deteriorate. BUN was 53, Cr 4.39. The physician decided she should be transferred to a higher level facility for her AKI on CKD. However, there were no beds available. So she remained at our facility awaiting transfer. Around 1900 that night, she experienced a bout of hypotension and decreased urine output. Chest xray was normal. EKG was NSR. She was eventually transferred to another hospital on 3/12 at 1300.

Contacted primary physician who said he would try to get me ENT appointment ASAP, but suggested  I get audiology evaluation ASAP, which I did, on Monday afternoon, 3/22/2021.  Eval confirmed hearing loss with problem in R middle ear.  Developed mild flu-like symptoms on Monday evening that persisted for about 30 hours...mild nausea, headache, malaise.  Appointment with Dr, ENT scheduled for 3/25/2021.  He said I was about the 5th vaccine related hearing loss he had seen, and has prescribed a course of Prednisone, in hopes hearing will return.

Friday, 4/2/2021, I woke up and could barely get out of bed and had the dry heaves for most of the day.  Not able to eat anything.  Stayed in bed (except to dry heave) for the day.  The odd thing about this is that just about a year ago, I had the Covid-19.  It lasted for about 6 weeks.  At the time (March/April) there wasn&#39;t any test available.  After I had the worst sore throat EVER, I then had the malaise and dry heaves for a few weeks.  Finally I found that Pepcid helped with the GI symptoms.  That was after about 3&#43;weeks of this.  I literally could not get off the couch and slept much of the time.  I just find interesting that one day of the same type of symptom that I had when I had the active virus was a side effect.  Also, note my antibodies have been positive to date.  I&#39;ve been getting them checked regularly.

They moved in wide circles- arms and legs.  This lasted through the day and next day it was sliightly better.  Balance was poor.  Had to hold onto things to walk.  Also I had fatigue.

I thought it was an exacerbation of my chronic issues, by Sunday 4/4/20221  I coughed up blood, and on Monday I went to the hospital and had a CT scan and was told I had a pulmonary embolism and a clot in my leg. Now I&#39;m on an injectable blood thinner for the rest of my life and I was told it would take 3-4 months to resolve the blood clots.
