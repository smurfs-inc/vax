                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Six hours after I received the vaccine I began to feel full body muscle aches and shivers. I took 2 Advil. I went to bed at 9:30 p.m. and woke up at 11:30 p.m. feeling as though I had slept 8 hours because I had a 102 fever. My face was burning from the heat and I was shaking. I took two more Advil. About 30 minutes later I threw up. I waited 30 more minutes and threw up again. As a result, of having Addison&#39;s disease, I have an emergency steroid injection that I use during crises such as this. I took my shot and immediately began feeling slightly better. I was able to go back to bed and at some point the fever went down overnight. I am currently feeling weak and with no fever. I also have a slight headache.

Took 600mg of ibuprofen every 4 hours to control pain. After second round of ibuprofen pain was tolerable. Day 2: when going off of ibuprofen severe pain returns with limited mobility again. Will continue ibuprofen for day 2.

                                                Around 8 pm (about 6 hours after receiving the vaccine) I started to feel typical flu symptoms such as chills and aches, and I had some body shaking as well. I was in bed that night and the symptoms kept getting stronger, and around 11 pm I started to feel tingling throughout my body, mostly in my hands and feet. It was very uncomfortable to lay still and I felt I&#39;d never be able to fall asleep if I couldn&#39;t lay still. I took 10mg of Z-Quil around 11:30 pm. My body and skin was also starting to get very hot, I never took my  body temperature but I probably had a fever. I put a cold compress on my forehead. I also took 1000 mg acetaminophen and 400 mg Advil. I got up to use the bathroom and I could walk but my balance was off and I felt tingling up my legs. I laid back in bed with the cold compress again and the tingling in my hands and feet increased. I tried walking around again and again felt tingling up my legs. I sat on the edge of my bed moving my feet around which helped the tingling, but when I laid down again the tingling kept coming back. I took another 10mg of Z-Quil and 0.25mg xanax (prescription for anxiety). I finally decided to move to a chair with lots of pillows so I could sit upright since that helped reduce the tingling. I finally fell asleep sometime after 12:30 am. I woke up in the chair around 2 am and was feeling better - no tingling, no body shaking, chills and aches were reduced and body temperature didn&#39;t feel as high. I was then able to sleep in bed for the rest of the night. The next day I still had aches and chills and a fever but it was manageable with Advil or acetaminophen, and by Monday (March 8) I was able to go to work.

After 18 hours, my temperature returned to normal and tremors and chills subsided completely. I remained very fatigued with some body aches and general soreness for another 24 hours.

I also was experiencing a heavy chest and shortness of breath. All but one of the adverse events went away after 24-36 hours - the shortness of breath and shallow breathing have persisted up through today. I am very aware of my breathing and how my chest feels tight, like I&#39;m not getting enough air.

                                                Hi, I received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine one week ago, Thurs March 11. On friday, I experienced the typical flu like symptoms - chills aches pains and fever. These have slowly gone away, but a week later I still have chills and constantly shake, and diarrhea. The most significant side effect I want to report is extreme vertigo and dizziness and headaches. These have been present for a week now and have prevented me from working and doing daily activities. I constantly feel like Im going to fall over and cannot see clearly. I previously had vestibular migraines, but these have been mostly gone due to going to the chiropractor and taking my supplements. The vaccine brought them back now in full force. I read that this is becoming a commonality among other people and need answers on this. I want to make sure its not permanent or that I will have this as a serious side effect.

                                                Patient was administered vaccine and told to wait the 15 minute monitoring period. After about 4 minutes, I heard her say &#34;I&#39;m not feeling right.&#34; I went to where she was sitting and asked &#34;are you ok?&#34; and had her take some slow, deep breaths. I then saw her eyes roll back and she lost consciousness. Thankfully, I was there and grabbed her as she toppled from the chair. I told the staff to call 911 and supported her neck and body in the chair. I could tell she was breathing and she was sweating profusely. I held her and spoke to her, and after about 15 seconds, she began to come out of it. After about a minute she was alert and orientated again.  I had her slowly sip a little water. The EMTs arrived in about 5 minutes and the assessed her vitals. She indicated that this was the first time anything like this had happened to her. They advised that since she had fainted, she should go to the hospital for observation, but she declined, stated that she felt fine at that point. Since she was driving, I insisted that she remain another one-half hour before leaving. During that time she drank more water and alternately sat and walked around the pharmacy. She did indicate that she had drank a protein shake that morning, but not eaten. I advised her to in the future, tell her doctor and/or any immunizer about the event. She left, stating that she was feeling fine, and I called her several hours later to make sure that she had indeed gotten home ok. She again said that she felt fine.

                                                Received the vaccine on a Thursday evening. 9 hours after I received the vaccine I woke up with chills, fever, headache, body aches, and a sore arm around the injection site. These symptoms lasted a full day (all of Friday) with the body aches being the most intense. When I woke up Saturday, these symptoms were gone with the exception of the sore arm which took another two days before getting back to normal. I took one 500 mg Acetaminophen on Friday to relieve the symptoms which didn&#39;t seem to help.

Patient did not hit the ground or injure herself-she did not lose consciousness she was flushed and sweating.  Pharmacist sat on floor with patient for 2-3 minutes and gave her water, patient was then able to stand up with little assistance and brought to sit down.  Patient stated she felt nauseous and may vomit she was given a trash can but did not vomit she was able to drink a bottle of water and was given a soft pretzel.  After about 10 minutes she stated she was feeling much better was no longer flushed or sweating she called her boyfriend for a  ride home.

Also starting three hours after the vaccine I had extremely painful muscle aches and pains. Bruise at injection site and swollen arm. Excruciating pain in both arms and both knees. When the leg pain started, it started behind my knees. I was in tears for about 14 hours in excruciating pain due to the muscle aches and I am still having random hurts of sharp muscle and joint pain.

                                                Experienced light headedness ( started before time stated but not sure when exactly). Around 6:30pm-7pm I began feeling dizzy, going between dizzy and light headed. I was drinking plenty fluids and did eat. A few people noted that I looked very out of it, and I felt very out of it. I tried staying seated and this did not have any effect on the dizzy feeling. I went to lay down and before going to sleep around 10pm-11pm, laying in bed I felt like the room was spinning. I also had typical symptoms, soreness as injections site and arm (starting immediately the day of vaccine), fever at it&#39;s highest was 102 (starting at 100.5 that morning, not peaking until Motrin wore off*see below*), feeling tired and very heavy.. like everywhere was waited down by something (starting early in the morning).  I was given Motrin by my coworker in the morning as I was had a headache  and was feeling sore and moving sore due to heavy feeling. Wednesday waking up the dizziness  and lightheadedness were gone. A slight feeling of being out of it however, fever was about 99-100 throughout the day (99 being my typical temp). As of today only a feeling of sore arm and tiredness which sometimes feels like I and out of it but I feel both from later yesterday and today is due to the tired feeling that comes common.

                                                12 hours after vaccine around 3:30am on Saturday I woke up with sever chills, shaking uncontrollably for an hour or 2. I fell back to sleep and woke up about an hour later burning up and sore head to toe. I threw up and had a migraine that lasted the rest of the day. I was able to fall asleep around 6:30am and when I woke up around 9 I was just exhausted, sore all over, nauseous, with a headache. This lasted about a day. On sunday afternoon my toddler lightly hit my right arm where the vaccine was and it became sore, red, and swollen. By the late evening that day the soreness and redness increased. Monday-Thursday the redness and swelling increased to about 2 inches round and felt very tight with a lump in the swelling and it was warm to the touch. By friday the redness and swelling reduced to about an inch, but there is still an inch small lump at the injection site and hurts when anything touches it. The redness has faded and there is no visual bruising.

I came out of it within 10 minutes. 16 hours later I had a 102 fever. Took Tylenol Felt fine 24 hours later 32 hours later I started to get a headache and light sensitivity. Fever back to over 99- low grade for me.  35 hours later I had such a bad headache and light sensitivity. I couldn?t watch tv, be on my phone, or look at a computer screen. I also started to get bouts of nausea. 38 hours later, I vomited for the first time. Same symptoms as what I described last. 42 hours later, I vomited again. 48 hours later - 5 days later, light sensitivity and  migraine symptoms continued , but improved slowly each day.               6 days later, all previous symptoms were gone. I woke up with a bump in my inner eye. Slowly went away throughout the day, then developed a itchy, red bump in between my lips and nose, that progressively got bigger throughout the day and made my lip swell. Bump was about 2 inches in diameter at its biggest. Took Claritin, cleaned face with alcohol, and by 24 hours later it was not noticeable.  8 days later, the bump appeared again in between lip and nose on the opposite side of my face.  Took Benadryl, bump slowly went down throughout the day. By 24 hours later it was gone

                                                Had no side effects whatsoever for many hours. Felt completely fine until about 7:30 pm, while I was making my plate of dinner. Felt lightheaded, dizzy, and hot. I began to black out, so I sat down, which helped for a few moments to subside lightheadedness. I was still feeling hot, so I walked a few feet to my back door and sat down on the steps outside to cool off. Within minutes, my vision blurred completely, I saw stars, and completely blacked out. My mother, who was nearby, heard me fall on the steps. She said my eyes rolled back, my body was completely limp, I was not breathing but rather making gurgling noises from my throat. She propped my head up, which allowed me to breathe properly, and I came to.   If my mother had not been nearby, I am convinced I would be dead right now. I saw the light, saw the other side, saw my relatives. I have had a near death experience once before, and this was exactly like that.

I then began to feel nauseous again and get extreme chills. I vomited multiple times, and was curled up in a fetal position crying from the nausea, headache, and a feeling of pressure in my chest. I ended up going to bed to sleep it off, waking up in a pool of sweat. I felt better the next day.

I also experienced an intense stomach pain that came and went that would make it difficult to move without severe pain. I felt extremely disoriented and confused and had a strong headache throughout the intense period of symptoms. Around 7 AM on April 9th the next day, the symptom&#39;s severity decreased and I experienced all of the symptoms mildly along with drowsiness. On april 10th I did not experience any stomach pain, body aches, or chills but, still experienced drowsiness, intermittent headaches and a mild fever. On april 11th, drowsiness  and a headache continued. Today, april 12th, I am still experiencing a mild headache and slight drowsiness.

                                                Within 2 hours of getting the vaccine, I developed a severe migraine, fever(100.1-100.4), chills, dizziness, extreme body aches, nausea and was very weak. Once the bulk of the symptoms subsided, a little under 48 hours after the vaccine was administered, I was able to resume to my daily life. I still have a lingering migraine, arm pain, body aches and a low grade fever of 99.9 now almost 72 hours later, but it is bearable unlike the immediate 48 hours following the vaccine. Over-the-counter medications usually take the edge off of my migraines, though they didn?t even come close to helping the one I currently have. I have been rotating Tylenol and ibuprofen since developing the side effects.

When lying down in the middle of the night, I experienced severe shortness of breath. The above situations lasted for 2 days. It began to ease on April 13, and there are still fever symptoms now.

                                                I had the common symptoms within 24hrs of receiving the vaccine, including headache, body aches, body chills, fever, and tiredness, which lasted approximately 24hrs. I had taken both Adderall and Allegra that day. 4 days after receiving the vaccine, I took Adderall and Allegra and had an adverse reaction (I hadn&#39;t taken Adderall the prior 3 days). I experienced palpitations and vertigo/dizziness plus slight nausea. The next day, I took a much lower dose of Adderall and decided to continue taking approximately 1/3rd of my typical dose after an E-visit with my primary care Dr. During the week of 4/5, I was able to increase the dose by a little bit without any adverse reactions. Starting on 4/11, I was able to take 2/3rds of the typical dose without adverse reaction. However, I am still experiencing vertigo/dizziness, which may or may not be sinus-related due to seasonal allergies.

It started with my body freezing and then I started shaking because I felt so cold and I covered up in blankets and a heating pad and still felt extremely cold. Then, the body aches began, and my whole body was very tired. After an hour of sleep, I took my temperature and it was 100.8. That is the highest that it rose to. My normal body temperature is 97.4. This lasted all through the night up until Saturday afternoon around 3:30 PM on 4/10/21.

                                                Felt okay until around 6:30pm that evening when I began to feel achy, fatigued, as well as pins and needles all over my limbs.  I was extremely tired and the aches had significantly increased so I went to bed at about 8:00pm. When I couldn?t sleep around 9:30pm I took 1000 mg of acetaminophen. I woke up at around 11:00pm and felt extremely feverish (shivering, entire body extremely soar. My joints hurt so badly that I couldn?t get comfortable) and nauseous. I then had 4 or 5 episodes of violent vomiting throughout the night every 2 or so hours.  After, I would be drenched in sweat.  When I got up *crawled to trash can next to my bed* at around 2:30/3:00AM I took 200mg ibprofin. Felt fatigued and no appetite the next day then was fine

                                                Had typical post vaccine symptoms right after - nausea, muscle aches, chills, fatigue. 5 days after vaccine those appeared to have dissipated. Went for a light walk in the morning. Completely lost vision in both eyes extremely blurry. Stumbled my way home running into trees, cars. Vision came back, thought it was migraine (had them before but nowhere NEAR as bad, never had vision completely blocked)  Excurtating headache behind eyes and nausea, feels like pressure in head. Worst headache of my life, went to ER. Gave morphine (did not help pain at all which was horrifying) got a head CT scan which came out clear and discharged because clotting ruled out. It is now day 6 and my headache is persistent and still excruciatingly painful. I?m also extremely nauseous. I?m terrified because I know something is very wrong. ER doc said might be lingering side effect from vaccine but those effects felt very different.

Tylenol was unhelpful but I had also taken my anxiety medication and 25mg of Benedryl, so the fact that it lasted roughly 4 hours is an estimation because i did eventually fall asleep.   Chest pain on 04/10/2021, ongoing but only sometimes excruciatingly painful. Had costochondritis about a year ago, it eventually went away. This pain is the same as that. I was told that people who get costochondritis are likely to get it again, so may be unrelated to the vaccine, but thought i would list it anyways.   General unwell feeling lasted until 04/13/2021  Unrelenting nausea lasted until 04/13/2021  Diarrhea started today 04/14/2021

The next morning I woke up with sharp stabbing pains in the left side of my head and numbness/tingling in the left side of my face. As the day went on I started to feel worse  so I went to the emergency room. The doctor there checked me out and stated that I had Bell&#39;s Palsy and prescribed me three different medications.  I am currently on these medicines trying to get better.

I had a severe fever, chills, headache, muscle spasms in my neck, and whole body aches. This was over the course of 7 hours where I woke up every couple of minutes and thought I was dying. I feel better now though.

                                                Received shot around 10:00am April 12th, by 12:00pm (beginning of work shift)I experienced a headache and took Advil, figured it was menstrual related since it started the same day. By 5:00 my body started to feel aches and chills but was very mild. By 5:30-5:45 I took a midal for the pain I was experiencing, more severe muscle/ back aches and chills. By 6:30 I went home early from work because symptoms were getting worse and it was hard to continue my shift. Once arriving home around 8 pain continue to progress but I figured I just needed to lay down and rest. By 9 I had soup but could barley finish due to pain. I continued to monitor my temperature because I was experiencing chills even though I had my heater on etc. by 10:00-10:30 my temperature went all the way up to 101.2 and I was concerned so I called 911. They sent an ambulance to come take me to the hospital. On the way there I believe my temperature went down. The paramedics took my temp and it was 99.5 before they took me to the hospital. And when the nurses took my temperature it was 97.8. This happened in the course of about 30-40 minutes of my phone call and arriving to the hospital. Either way I was concerned about the pain because I know there would be symptoms following the shot but I didn?t think it would be so severe. After waiting to be checked in and evaluated they proscribed me Tylenol and ibuprofen. But at a location that was closed for the day. I asked if I could just take more pain killers for the pain (midal and Advil) and I was told i could. Once arriving home by 11:30 I took two midal pills and the pain reduced within an hour. So I was able to sleep. The next day I still experienced pain but took pain killers to help with it.

Lying down makes me feel better, as does any position where I&#39;m resting my head. Yesterday I also had a weird feeling in my throat that came and went rhythmically.

                                                The side effects began the night following my vaccine and lasted the entire next day. It began with fatigue/brain fog, then chills and soreness at the injection site. Once the chills began I was very ill with a fever (100-101), severe aches and pains in my body from head to toe, and experienced  occasional shooting pains. Once the fever went away about 30 hours after my vaccine, I still felt pain and heaviness in my body and had a bad headache. The next day (day 3) was much better- I had no fever but still felt some brain fog, drowsiness, and slight muscle soreness (but no pain).   Two weeks after my vaccine (4/20/21)  I had a very similar experience but am not certain it was related to the vaccine. I developed chills, fatigue, and a headache for the majority of the day. In the evening, it progressed to muscle/joint pain, a severe headache, extreme fatigue, and a 100 degree fever. The next day (today 4/21), the fever has subsided and I feel slightly fatigued. Though I am not sure this was related to the vaccine, it mirrored my initial reaction to the vaccine two weeks prior. It is very unusual for me to get a fever in the 100 degree range and typically only happens every two years or so.

The fever and chills lasted through the next day - body ache and soreness throughout both of those days. For those two days I did not work. (Ended the 8th when it was time for me to go to bed.) I did have heart palpitations the night of the 9th that I did go get ER  -they gave me a dose of Ativan and they sent me home. That took care of the heart palpitation symptoms.  I followed up with my provider the following week.

I felt better for a few days and five or six days after the shot I started to get headaches again. The headaches got progressively worse and more frequent. I don&#39;t normally get headaches. It was pain at the lower back side of my head which was dull but got worse and throbbing in periods. My pain level was an eight or nine. They lasted most of the day. I am still getting a few headaches after three weeks. I have been taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen and it is starting to get better. It is still every day and the mornings are worse before I take a pain reliever. My pain level with the headaches is more like a 3-5 range level of pain.

                                                I woke up at 3 am Friday with cold sweats and body aches. Took 1000 mg Tylenol. Woke up again at 10:30 am to a fever still and this odd extremity feeling. Felt like I had a compression body suit on and weight of 50 pounds around my arms and legs, Mild shortness of breath. I felt like I was swollen but did not see any. I called my PCP and vaccine line and both nurses said go to the ER. I went to the ER they ran tests. The time of the ER I started getting leg cramping and spasming. Those symptoms continued to the weekend. On Sunday the weight and swelling feeling went away. I still had bad muscle cramping and swelling. I did telehealth on Tuesday with PCP and was given muscle relaxer which helped some throughout the rest of the week. Thursday night I have a temp pf 99.6 and went up to 100.6 on Friday morning. On Friday I became shortness of breath and fatigued. It became difficult to go up and down stairs or walking about 20 ft without difficulty breathing. I now have a lower right leg muscle twitch/spasm that comes and goes. I switched to a different PCP, he ran more blood work on Wednesday 4/21. And discussed the next steps for treatment and monitoring.

                                                Exactly one week after my shot (4/14) I felt a headache in the evening. It felt like it was sinus related so I figured it was allergies. However it continued the next day so I tried Advil.  It kept going. It has now been 2 weeks and a day since the headaches started and I still have them. They go away late at night and return shortly after I wake up. They feel like tension headaches in the back of my head and  also sinus headaches. I was concerned about clots so I went to the dr on 4/19. She did not think it was clots because the headaches were not severe and I had no other symptoms. She had me do different tests and concluded I had no neurological issues. She gave me a prescription for butalb-apap-caf50. This did not help. She also told me not to drink alcohol so I didn?t. I started feeling better on 4/24. I had a little to drink and my head hurt really bad. My headache was practically nonexistent 4/25 so I had one glass of wine. Not even half way through that glass, the head feeling from last night came back. The next day my headaches were back and have now continued since. I stopped drinking and have not felt that bad feeling in my head at night since. The headaches aren?t severe but they really suck. They make it hard to do things and all I want to do is lie down even though that doesn?t help. Exercise and walks sometimes help. No medication has made any noticeable difference.

                                                I took one preventative Tylenol at 7pm per a friend?s recommendation. I woke up at 11:55p (8 hours post vaccine, two hours after falling asleep) due to full body chills and shaking. I took two Tylenol. This lasted about 45 minutes. I felt cold but didn?t have a fever.  I kept waking up throughout the night clammy.  I woke up at 5:30a (30 mins earlier than normal) because I couldn?t sleep and had a headache.  I felt sore and achy and very fatigued all day. I took the afternoon off work and came home and slept 3 hours. Still felt groggy and sore after. Felt more normal the next morning. My left arm is still sore two days post vaccination.

I had to go home from work due to these feelings. Eventually, developed into a fever. I went home and the chills and aches worsened. I could not get warm not matter how many layers or blankets I had. I took tylenol and fell asleep after several hours. When I woke up, I was profusely sweaty, my fever  broke. I was able to eat a small lunch and continued to lie down the whole day. My symptoms lessened and were more minimal 24 hours after. After going to sleep the second night, I felt back to normal upon wake up.

                                                Fever started at around 4:30 am the morning after receiving the vaccine. The chills woke me up, so I took Tylenol 1000 mg and my fever broke about an hour later. I had to keep taking Tylenol 1000 mg at 10:30 am and 4:30 pm to control my fever. Each dose worked well for the first 3 hours or so on the fever, but then it would come back. I also had muscle and headaches and fatigue, which made it very difficult to move around. The Tylenol also helped with that somewhat, but I spent most of the day in bed and on the couch (and I am normally very active). By around 5:30-6pm, the symptoms were fading slowly. I felt a lot less achy and my body temperature felt closer to regular by the time I went to bed at 9pm.

                                                I noticed a very mild headache and slight coldness within 2 hours of my vaccine.  Onset of my severe symptoms began around 10PM on 03/12/2021 with a stabbing headache (Felt like someone took an air pump and kept &#39;blowing up&#39; my head. My eyes felt achy and heavy and every time I looked in a different direction I would get a zapping/electric feeling throughout my head that would cause my head and neck to spasm (longer duration) or twitch (quick jolt). This also caused dizziness). I got really cold and had intense shivering and shaking. Around midnight, my skin started feeling bruised all over my body (very sensitive to touch, including my bed sheets against my spine felt like rubbing up against a wound). At the same time, my joints (especially my neck, hips, and knees) got hot to the touch and were incredibly painful (induced tears). My muscles developed a deep ache that also caused significant pain. I felt very weak and confused. I didn&#39;t take my temperature until the early morning, and it was 102.9 at that time. I alternated taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen throughout the day, but my temperature stayed between 102 and 103.1 for about 24 hours, as did the previously noted symptoms.   I noticed a gradual improvement of my symptoms over the next two days. On the evening of 03/14/2021, my headache worsened some, and I had an unexpected episode where I nearly passed out (dropped to the floor but stayed conscious). I also had intermittent foot tingling (very noticeable, not mild) over the course of a few hours.   For 3 full days (but by far the most severe within the first 24 hours), I experienced some strange sound processing. Things like the sound of a car driving by or the ceiling fan felt like it echoed throughout my whole body and gave me an uncomfortable shivering feeling.   As of today (03/16/2021), I am mostly recovered. I am still experiencing fatigue, a very mild headache, and some mild pain. My nausea has completely resolved, though that was never a chief complaint of mine.   I realize that some of my symptoms are to be expected with this vaccine. But especially the level of pain I experienced throughout my entire body was very concerning and not something that I was aware could happen as a result of the vaccine.

                                                Within 8 hours of receiving the vaccine, I started to feel weak and began to develop a fever. By that night I had a 102f fever. My muscles were very achey, and my heart was racing. I was slightly nauseous but still able to eat a little. By 24 hours after the shot my fever was down to 99f.  I started to get diarrhea beginning the second day and has lasted until now the third day after vaccination day.

                                                About five hours after the vaccine injection, at around 11 PM, I began to feel cold and achy, which soon led to body chills all over. It felt like I could not get warm no matter how many extra blankets I added. This soon led to a fever. I was in an out of sleep for the next few hours and woke up around 2:30 AM. At that point the fever had broken and I was sweating. I still had body aches, which I think was due to my body being tensed up for some many hours, and I had a splitting headache, as well. At around 4:30 AM, I woke up again, with a very sore arm a terrible headache still. I got up and took 400 mg of Ibuprofen and went back to sleep. At 7 AM my alarm went off and all adverse effects seemed to be gone other than a sore arm. The sore arm last for about 6 days.

                                                Injection technique seemed poor as it was the most painful vaccination I&#39;ve ever received, and upper arm became tight and achy immediately. Soreness lingered but the sharper pain went away shortly after. About 8-10 hours later I began feeling nauseous and lightheaded. 12 hours after vaccine I had trouble falling asleep, overcome with nausea and chills.  This turns into sweating and insomnia the rest of the night. The following day I felt better, but the next night (and following one) I continued feeling a bit sick. Currently (3 days later) my upper arm is still very sore and I have lots of muscle/joint aches throughout my whole body.

I didn&#39;t take anything for awhile for it. Thursday morning, on the first, my arm - at the injection site - was swollen to size of nickel. Over the next few days it grew to a size of a paper dollar bill - red, hot and swollen and very itchy. Saturday - 4/3/2021 - I went to a pharmacy where I get my meds and the pharmacist suggested I take anti-inflammatories and Benadryl. I did put ice pack on before taking those. I do still have a lump on my arm at the injection site - it&#39;s probably the size of a quarter now.

                                                Vaccination appointment was at 1:30 pm on Monday, April 5. I received the shot at around 2:00pm in my left arm. It hurt going in, but quickly dissipated as I moved my arm. I felt fine for the rest of the day. I felt normal the following morning (April 6), but started to feel tired in the early afternoon. I took a nap around 3:00-4:30pm, and woke up feeling slightly hungry. I went to bed around 11:00pm. I woke up the next day (April 7) with a headache. I called in sick to work and stayed in bed as my headache grew worse and nausea began to appear. I threw up for the first time at 11:00am, then again around 11:30am. I emptied my bowels in between these bouts of vomiting, and my stomach was very obviously empty after the second bout. I took a nap from 12:00-2:00pm, after which I threw up at 2:30pm and then again at 3:00pm and again at 3:30pm. I took another nap from 4:00-5:00pm, then threw up again around 5:30pm. I threw up a seventh time around 6:00pm and saw  a couple flecks of blood in my vomit. Each bout was sudden in onset and violent but quick. I think I burst some of the blood vessels in my throat, because it was sore. I called a friend to take me to the ER, and threw up once or twice more while waiting. On the way to the ER, I threw up for the last time. The ER gave me Toradol, Zofran, and two bags of IV fluids. This improved all my symptoms. The next morning, April 8, I felt much better until 12:00pm, when I laid down for a nap and couldn&#39;t get out of bed until 4:30. My headache had returned so I took Advil, then ate some rice. I felt better from 6:00pm onwards.

I called for help and the pharmacist called EMTs who checked me out. After about 45 minutes, I felt better and requested to leave and NOT be transported to a local hospital.

                                                I received the vaccine at around 5:23pm, and then about 11pm the same night I was awoken from sleep by terrible body shivers. I managed to doze off for about an hour before I was woken up again by a migraine at midnight; dozed off again, and woke up at around 2 am with a mild fever (around 99.3 degrees). Sometime between the migraine and fever I began to develop terrible body aches as well. The first 24 hours were the worst as I was completely bedridden. The next day, 4/8/21, was better, but the body aches and migraine persisted all day while the fever broke late morning. The third day (today, 4/9/21) everything is feeling better but the migraine is still a persistent issue.

At around 4pm, a mild headache started, and I was experiencing cramping from my chest down to my stomach. I had no appetite that evening. By 8pm, I had a 101.0 fever, and by 9:30pm the cramps were severe in my lower stomach. I was sweating profusely and shaking until I vomited, which helped to relieve some of the stomach pain. Before I vomited, I was in intense pain- possibly some of the worst pain that I have experienced in my life. The sweats and chills alternated throughout the night, and the headache was intense. The next day, the chills, sweats and headache persisted until mid-afternoon, in addition to the occasional stomach pain and diarrhea. The side effects slowly subsided, and I was feeling better by 4/9. The sweating was the longest lasting side effect.

Lower back started hurting, followed by all joints and eventually every part of my body was in pain. 103 fever, severe chills. Sweating, nausea, shakes.

Throughout the night my body became extremely sensitive and sore especially in my lower back and neck. My temperature also continued to rise to 103.0.  Throughout the day of 4/9/21 I was taking Tylenol and ibuprofen on a rotating schedule. My temperature went up and down throughout the day spiking at 105.7 and dropping down to 101.2. Around 10:00 PM it was around 102.9 and my body was becoming even weaker. This morning, now 36 hours after my symptoms started, I can barely lift my arm, my headache has worsened, my total soreness and weakness is no better and my temperature is 102.3.  I have also had trouble with staying hydrated because my skin hurts if it is not covered from the air and I get heavy chills,  but when I cover up I am profusely sweating constantly. The sweat is so bad, I constantly have to lay on a towel and change my clothes.

By around 9-10 PM, I had a fever of about 100.5 degrees with pretty severe chills, and my arm had started to hurt VERY badly.  For almost the entire rest of the weekend (from Friday night-Sunday), I was very fatigued and achy and could not lay on my left side due to the soreness in my arm.  The fever seemed to pass by mid-day on Saturday, though, and I was able to go back to work on Monday.  It was not pleasant, but it was totally worth it and a million times better than actually being sick with COVID!

I went to sleep around 9pm but my body was so pain that I couldn&#39;t really fall asleep. The whole body was pain. I didn&#39;t have short breathe but I had to breathe heavily to catch myself. Until 2am my arms, legs, face and head started numbing and I couldn&#39;t even grab anything. My hand were like sprained. That&#39;s when my hunsband has to go buy pain killers for me. He also bought thermometer. I checked my Temperature it&#39;s was ~96F. I took ibuprofen and some milk, bread and egg. The pain and numbing was getting off after ~40min after I took Ibuprofen. Then I was able to sleep on bed.

Walked to the observatory area where we are supposed to wait 15min until you are released to go. Well less than 10 min in the observation area that?s when i started to feel un well my body started sweating excessively and thats when i felt numbness on my right side of my head with a tingling sensation couldn?t hear with my right ear and i freaked out when i started to get blurred vision thats when i knew something was wrong i got up to ask for water once i got up i felt like i was going to faint and felt really dizzy. Once i got to the lady that was there in the observation area  she was shocked at how i looked she told me to go sit down and brought me water as she called the ambulance. Once i was sitting down and was brought water i drank like more than half of the water and the numbness was going down from my right side of my head but still had blurred vision and just felt disoriented and not my self. The ambulance took me to the ER once i got there i felt a little better but still disoriented and dizzy. So disoriented that i left the hospital with me actually realizing i had to stay there to get checked because they kept saying i was fine.

Around approximately 8pm I was feeling very feverish, experiencing body aches, mental fog, intense shaking and chills,  and within the next few hours threw up multiple times. I eventually fell asleep and sweated profusely, waking up multiple times (unusual for me). The next day I had low appetite, fatigue, and body aches, but other symptoms were reduced.

                                                In the evening while making dinner I noticed mild pain at injection site and began to notice increasing chills, and unusually intense tiredness, which were followed that night by a low grade fever, headache, and nausea which led to vomiting.  Was unable to sleep that night and unable to eat most of the following day due to these symptoms, primarily the nausea. Symptoms began to resolve during the later afternoon of April 11th. No medical treatment sought as these were side effects listed on the fact sheet and expected to go away which they did. Still experiencing mild arm pain in injection arm but expecting that to resolve soon on its own.

                                                I got the J&amp;J vaccine around 2:30pm on a Saturday and by 6 or 7pm I was experiencing a really bad headache. This headache extended down my back and around the back and top of my skull. By 8pm I had began experiencing chills, body aches, and nausea. By 9pm I had a fever and could not stand up without feeling like I was going to vomit. Walking to even get water in the other room gave me motion sickness. I was shaking and sweating with a fever all night, was unable to sleep, and experienced hallucinations due to the high fever. The next morning I still had a fever but could finally sleep. I still had a bad headache, body aches, and nausea. I slept most of the day and my fever went down but was still &gt;100 degrees all day. On Monday, I had a mild fever in the morning which went away by afternoon. I  felt weak all day Monday and still experienced body aches and a headache. By Tuesday, I was only experiencing fatigue and brain fog. This lasted about a week.

These symptoms started about 6 hours post-vaccine and lastest for about 36 hours on and off.    Arm at injection site is still sore to the touch, but manageable.   Around 3 PM on Sunday, April 11th a small rash/hives broke out on the inside of my left arm opposite of my elbow. My vaccine was given in the right arm, but the right arm did not have any reaction. This rash lasted for about 12-24 hours and then was gone. It was never itchy.

I continued to have fever and chills and body aches.   At 9:30am, I had body aches and felt only slightly feverish. I took acetaminophen for the rest of the day and had no problems.

Could easily be a pulled muscle but I?m also concerned about blood clots so I?m watching my symptoms and if anything worsens, I will get seen by patient first.

                                                I had sparkles in my vision 5 min. after getting my shot. They went away quickly, so I wasn&#39;t concerned. I had a little bit of hotness up my neck and a little itchy, but both also were quick to go away. I went home and went to bed without issue. I woke up at 4am crying and in a lot of pain all over my body. I had a crushing headache, my back, arms and legs ached down to the bone. I had a fever of 100.7, and had to call in sick from work. I took 3 ibuprofen and it didn&#39;t help stop the pain or fever. I cried myself back to sleep after wreathing in pain for 3 hours. Woke up again crying again and the pain and fever continued on. I drank 2 beers to see if that would help relax my muscles and back around 3pm and by 4pm I finally felt somewhat better, but still couldn&#39;t get up out of bed. I had to call my brother over to help me and considered asking him to take me to the hospital several times because the pain was so intense. The spot where I got my shot wasn&#39;t inflamed, or if it was I didn&#39;t notice. It did seem a little stiff. I managed to fall back asleep and by the time I woke up again the next day around 5am, I felt completely fine. Fever disappeared and the body pain was gone. It was like nothing had ever happened.

                                                Friday evening I had what I thought was normal reaction: chills, aches, headache, nausea. Saturday it was mostly aches. Sunday was dizziness, aches, nausea and cramping in left leg. Monday was nausea, aches, tingling in hands and feet, headache, brain fog. Tuesday I woke up with major imbalance and needed to use walls to walk without falling over. Dizziness subsided after some time to only rapid movements. I had a warm burning sensation in left leg with tingling hands and feet. Moderate headache. Reports came out of stopping the Janssen vaccine so I contacted my doctor with my symptoms and they ordered blood tests for clots.

                                                On 03/18/2021 at 03:30AM I had a lot of arm pain from my shoulder to my elbow in my left arm. This lasted until 03/31/2021.  On 03/18/2021 I woke up with a headache that would not go away. Next, at about 03:15PM I was not able to walk for about 10 minutes. Then, at about 05:00PM I started menstruating. At 07:00PM I had severe pain in my pelvic area for an hour and a half. At approximately 08:30PM I passed a softball sized blood clot vaginally.  I bled heavily through the night.  On 03/19/2021 I still had a headache and no energy at all. I continued to bleed heavily all day as well. 03/20/2021 was the exact same as the days prior. 03/21/2021 I was still bleeding heavily throughout the day with no energy. I still had the headache as well. I started feeling dizzy while walking on this day.  03/22/2021 I went to work like normal. I was cold all day. I was still bleeding, headache and dizziness. It was hard to stand for 30 minutes. While climbing the stairs I got very light headed and dizzy. I could not go up the stairs at a normal pace. 03/23/2021 I had the same symptoms all day but I was getting short of breath walking short distances. I still had very little energy and a headache. I also lost all color in my face and hands. I was still cold all day. I noticed some slight swelling in my ankles.  03/24/2021 The symptoms were getting more intense. I was still cold.  I finally took some aspirin for the headache because it was very severe. The medication didn&#39;t help with it. This routine went on for the next week and the symptoms intensified with each day. Throughout this time I was still passing clots that ranged in size from golf/ping pong ball to baseballs. They were very painful when they passed.  The days from 03/25/2021 to 04/01/2021 were all the same as far as how I felt.  On 04/02/2021 I woke up with the same symptoms but now I could not stay awake for anything. I slept on and off all day. I only ate one meal a day because I was so tired and I had no appetite. The headache was getting worse as the days went on. The bleeding was still happening. It was not as heavy as the weeks before, but enough to be painful still. I also started having abdominal pain.  On 04/03/2021 I was seeing stars when I moved too quickly. My heart rate was elevated with shortness of breath along with the rest of the previous symptoms. My headache however was very intense.  04/04/2021 I still couldn&#39;t stay awake on top of all the other symptoms. The dizziness and stars were more frequent. I couldn&#39;t move my head without seeing stars.  04/05/2021 I couldn&#39;t get warm and I still felt the same way. I called and made a doctor?s appointment for Wednesday the 7th. I had all the same symptoms still and they were getting worse. I had to move in slow motion so I could try to function.  04/06/2021 I woke up drained of all my energy and color. I couldn&#39;t shower because of the pain in my body. I couldn&#39;t stand because I felt like I was going to fall down. I could barely stand up straight let alone walk very far. I was shaking from being so cold. I had all the same symptoms from the days prior. I was in severe pain. I couldn&#39;t sit because of the pain in my abdomen I couldn&#39;t stand because of the weakness in my legs. I could barely see anything because of the stars I was seeing. At this point I had no color and I was barely conscious. That is when my family took me to the emergency room.

                                                I received my J&amp;J COVID-19 vaccine at around 1:45 p.m. on April 7, 2021. The shot itself was hardly painful, and I felt fine in the wake of the vaccine. That same evening, I had a fever of around 100 degrees , along with chills and fatigue. My most notable symptom was a severe, pounding headache throughout my forehead. It seemed to be localized above my eyes, in the front of my head. This was surprising to me, as I never get headaches. I took some acetaminophen and went to sleep, and the next day the headache had subsided slightly. The headache did not subside completely until 3 days after the vaccine and even now, nearly two weeks after the vaccine, I still get a slight headache in the same location (above my eyes, across my forehead) unexpectedly. Again, I never got headaches until receiving this vaccine.

I could tell because I was very hot and sweaty even though my room was air conditioned.  I drank water and immediately was nauseous and vomited.  I continued to have sweats, chills, and after about another hour body aches set in.  My whole body was cramping up and my hands were shaky.  I was very short of breath over short movements like to get to the bathroom, I would be out of breath and dizzy.   Around 1700  (6 hours post shot) I took Tylenol and continued to take it every six hours.  I was able to keep ginger ale and crackers down but didn&#39;t eat much else until the next morning.  I think the fever broke in the night.  The next morning I was just really tired and sore, but much less achy than the day prior.   I was able to eat light meals  and I stopped taking Tylenol sometime that mid-morning.  I felt fine the next day (about 48 hours after the shot).

                                                I began to feel shortness of breath when walking, tightness in my chest, for the same reason any physical effort made me feel like I was short of breath. (The day before I had presented the common symptoms such as fever, chills, arm pain, muscle pain) however this symptom was off the list, at 11:30 in the morning I had to go to an emergency clinic, they checked me with blood test, urine tests, medical exam, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray. The doctor told me that everything was fine that I could leave. I had to pay a high bill at the hospital. The following 7 days the sensation was disappearing very slowly. However from day 8 it started again, until now on day 13, I still having sensation of shortness of breath when doing physical exercise, it is something that lasts and does not disappear.

                                                a 27 y.o. female with a history of Covid infection December 26, 2020, positive covid test December 29, 2020. She had approximately 2 weeks of symptoms including generalized body ache and generalized weakness.  Fatigue and some headache.  Had some persistence of symptoms after that time.  Had some benefit from ibuprofen.   Was seen at emergency room on January 27, 2021 stating that she felt that all her symptoms of Covid had resolved except for some chest pain which awoke her on January 27.  She presented to the emergency room.  Had sinus tachycardia at 113 but otherwise unremarkable physical exam, laboratory studies with white blood count elevated 16,004-20, hemoglobin 13.7 g hematocrit 41.8%, MCV 87.1, RDW 12.7%, platelet count 329,000, segs 72.8%, lymphs 20.6%, monocytes 4%, eosinophils 1%, basophil 0.6%.  BUN 10.1, creatinine 0.8, AST 24, ALT elevated 56, alkaline phosphatase 68, total protein 7.6, total bilirubin 0.3, albumin 3.6, globulin by subtraction 4.0, troponin less than 0.02, D-dimer quantitative 0.22, urine pregnancy test normal.  Chest x-ray normal.  Chest pain appears to be musculoskeletal and was reproduced by palpation of her chest wall.  No evidence of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.  D-dimer was normal.  Heart rate returned to normal after some intravenous fluids.  Patient discharged on Zithromax 500 mg day 1 and then to 50 mg days 2 through 5.  Also continued on ibuprofen.   Received Johnson and Johnson vaccine April 5, 2021.  Over the next week patient started having increasing soreness.  Her joints hurt more than usual and her headache was worse.  She had a sensation that her legs were &#34;numb and tingly&#34; starting at her buttocks and extending down her leg.   Because of reported incidence of cerebral sinus thrombosis or cerebral vein thrombosis patient appropriately presented for screening in the emergency room and was sent for appropriate imaging.   April 16, 2021 CT scan of head with and without contrast no acute intracranial hemorrhage, no mass-effect or midline shift.  On contrast-enhanced images there appears to be a lobular nonocclusive filling defect in the far lateral right transverse sinus.  Lobular occlusive filling defect is also likely present in the mid to central right transverse sinus.  Short segment filling defect in the medial left transverse sinus.  Remainder of sinuses and internal cerebral veins are patent.  Focal lobular filling defect within the confluence of the right and transverse sinus most likely related to arachnoid granulation.  No edema hemorrhage of the cerebellum or cerebrum.  No other significant findings.   April 16, 2021 confirmatory MRI angiogram of head without contrast with no restricted diffusion to suggest acute or subacute infarct.  Contrast void in the middle to central right transverse sinus consistent with occlusive thrombus.  Nonocclusive thrombus in the far lateral right transverse thrombus.  Narrowing of the medial left transverse sinus without complete occlusion.   April 16, 2021 2345 hrs. inital hematology consultation.  D-dimer and fibrinogen levels have been requested stat and are still pending.  If fibrinogen level is low will replace with cryoprecipitate.  If D-dimer is elevated barely confirms diagnosis of possible vaccine related thrombosis.  The fact the patient is not thrombocytopenic at this time is encouraging, however despite the lack of thrombocytopenia she still has clearly documented symptomatic nonocclusive and occlusive thrombus in her cerebral sinus.   From UPtoDate.com Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, also referred to as the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine) ? On April 13, 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended pausing administration of AD26.COV2.S  to further investigate rare cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and thrombocytopenia [33]. As of that date, six cases had been reported, all in females aged 18 to 48 years with onset 6 to 13 days after vaccination; during this period, 6.8 million doses were administered (with 1.5 million doses in females of that age range) [121-123]. Since some vaccine recipients have not been followed for longer than the time frame over which these symptoms develop, the incidence may change with additional follow-up. Initial symptoms included headache, backache, chills, and fatigue, and progressed to focal neurologic deficits. Intracerebral hemorrhage and thromboses at other sites were also seen in some patients. All of the five patients who were tested for the anti-PF4 HIT antibody tested positive. Another case, in a young male who was a vaccine recipient in one of the pre-emergency use authorization efficacy trials, had been previously reported. These cases appear similar to those reported following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222, another adenovirus-vector vaccine. Although rare, the observed number of events exceeded the expected rate among females &lt;50 years old. Given the extreme rarity of these events, the FDA and CDC acknowledge that they recommended the pause out of an abundance of caution and to ensure awareness of these rare events.    ?Evaluation and management of possible thrombotic complications ? Recipients should be aware of the possible association and seek immediate care for signs and symptoms suggestive of thrombocytopenia (eg, new petechiae or bruising) or thrombotic complications (including shortness of breath, chest pain, lower extremity edema, persistent severe abdominal pain, unabating severe headache, severe backache, new focal neurologic symptoms, and seizures) [117]. In such cases, some experts suggest evaluation with complete blood count and differential (including the platelet count), quantitative D-dimer, HIT testing, and imaging of any suspected site of thrombosis [113,114,125]. Onset 4 to 20 days after vaccination, platelet count &lt;150,000/microL, elevated D-dimer, and a positive anti-PF4 antibody (HIT antibody) suggest the diagnosis. Treatment with a non-heparin/non-warfarin anticoagulant (eg, argatroban or direct oral anticoagulant) and intravenous immune globulin has been suggested. The CDC recommends not using heparin in individuals with thromboses following receipt of Ad26.COV2.S unless HIT testing is negative [126]. (See &#34;Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&#34; and &#34;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&#34;, section on &#39;Terminology and HIT variants&#39; and &#34;Management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&#34;, section on &#39;Role of IVIG&#39;.)   As stated above all the 6 cases were &#34;all in females aged 18 to 48 years with onset 6 to 13 days after vaccination&#34; this would certainly fit the timeframe that we are seeing in this case.  Recommendations from national guidelines would be to start treatment with dexamethasone immediately while awaiting intravenous gammaglobulin.  To pursue intravenous gammaglobulin treatment at 1 g/kg over 1 to 2 days.  It is recommended to avoid heparin and instead use direct factor X inhibitor such as Eliquis, which this patient is already been started on.     There is unfortunately considerable risk that even though patient&#39;s symptoms appear mild at this time, that she may deteriorate in the very near future and I would recommend treating her aggressively at this time with dexamethasone and intravenous gammaglobulin while we are awaiting further testing.  Patient clearly has had unusual thrombosis, especially in a 27-year-old.     With the fact that she had headache dating back to January, it is impossible to determine the acute versus chronic nature of her venous sinus thrombosis. Covid infection does cause increase in coagulation as well.  However, given the small risk of tragic outcome with cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis in the setting of Covid vaccinations, we will proceed aggressively with treatment starting tonight with intravenous gammaglobulin and intravenous dexamethasone.     Will require rapid fasting glucoses to evaluate possible hyperglycemia from high-dose dexamethasone.  Will consider stopping dexamethasone at 48 hours.  Current recommendation for gammaglobulin would be single 1 g/kg or 500 mg/kg over 2 days.  No recommendations for treatment beyond this point.  Current recommendations for gammaglobulin dosing would recommend using an adjusted dose for patients with greater than 125% of their ideal body weight.  This patient at 122 kg on a 5 foot 2 inch frame does qualify for adjusted dose and her orders reflect that.   I appreciate the opportunity see this patient this evening and consultation requested by Dr.  We will follow patient in hospital.  Hopefully she will have gradual improvement and avoid any serious or tragic complications of her cerebral sinus thrombosis.     We will have pharmacy report possible adverse reaction to Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine to the FDA as required by law.   April 17, 2021 follow up. No new events.  Laboratory studies remained excellent.  White blood count is further elevated, however, this may be secondary to high-dose dexamethasone with a white blood count of 16,060.  Hemoglobin 14.0 g hematocrit 42.8%, MCV 86.8, RDW 12.9%.  Platelet count is actually increased slightly at 374 as of 9:10 AM this morning.  Differential shows left shift as expected with dexamethasone.  Results from yesterday showed fibrinogen normal at 369 (180?415) pro time normal at 10.4 seconds with INR of 0.97, PTT 26.7.  D-dimer 0.23 (0.19?0.50).  With platelet count, fibrinogen and D-dimer normal I am inclined to believe that this is not an acute post vaccination HIT-like phenomena.  If it were I would still expect to see some degree of thrombocytopenia elevated D-dimer and perhaps low fibrinogen.  The other explanations for her cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are either idiopathic spontaneous and merely coincidentally associated at the exact same time as her Covid infection or more likely, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis secondary to hypercoagulable state secondary to her Covid infection from December 2020.  Unfortunatly there is no way to accurately date the acuity of the venous thrombosis in her cerebral sinus.  HIT Testing is still pending and most likely will not be available for 3-4 more days despite being ordered stat.  Have called the laboratory and asked them to check with our outside reference lab what the expected return time is on this test. (LabCorp says &#34;Tuesday April 20, 2021).  Patient refused intravenous gammaglobulin infusion which has been ordered last night.  Patient has been receiving dexamethasone which was a bridge until intravenous gammaglobulin could be administered.  Current guidance from the expert hematology panel (EHP) on Covid vaccine induced thrombosis dated April 7, 2021 from the  public health would state that a patient who has a reduced platelet count without thrombosis with a D-dimer normal and normal fibrinogen or thrombosis with a normal platelet count and D-dimer normal and normal fibrinogen are &#34;unlikely cases&#34;.  They recommend for probable cases who have D-dimers that are elevated to send HIT assay and then give immediate intravenous gammaglobulin while awaiting results.  They recommend fibrinogen supplementation, if needed.  They recommend a direct acting antithrombin agents such as the Eliquis this patient is receiving.  They recommend steroids particularly if there is a delay in getting intravenous gammaglobulin delivered.  With the fact that we now have 24 hours in the hospital with no evidence of thrombocytopenia, no evidence of increased fibrinolytic activity or active thrombosis, and no evidence of hypofibrinogenemia, I would argue that her presentation is subacute.  In this setting, I do not feel intravenous gammaglobulin would be necessary and does involve a small risk as well as considerable cost.  Dexamethasone also involves small risk and negligible cost. I have discontinued both of these medications.  My overall impression would be that this was not related to her Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination which was recent, but rather her more distant Covid infection.  It is impossible to definitively answer the question however.  The next question is duration of anticoagulation.  Risk of recurrent cerebral sinus venous thrombosis is relatively small but the morbidity can be high.  Studies have been performed showing medications in the same class as Eliquis have been associated with a decrease in incidence of the recurrence.  Most hematologist recommend 3 months of anticoagulation for provoked venous thrombosis including cerebral sinus venous thrombosis.  I feel this patient&#39;s thrombosis is &#34;provoked&#34;, with her association at the same time of her Covid infection (and possibly vaccination).  I would recommend Eliquis (apixaban) 5 mg twice daily or Xarelto (rivaroxaban) 20 mg daily with food. I would feel comfortable in discharging patient for outpatient follow up IF Dr and other speciality services agree. Plan 3 months of full dose anticoagulation with direct factor X inhibitor.   Circulation 2010 Jun 29;121(25):2740-6 &#34;Long-term evaluation of the risk of recurrence after cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis&#34;, Background: The clinical course of cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis (CSVT) is largely unknown because prospective studies with a long follow-up and with the goal to assess thrombosis recurrence rate and predisposing factors for recurrence are lacking. Methods and results: One hundred forty-five patients with a first CSVT were followed up for a median of 6 years after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment. End points were recurrent CSVT or other clinical manifestations of venous thromboembolism. CSVT recurred in 5 patients (3%) and other manifestations of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism) were seen in 10 additional patients (7%), for a recurrence rate of 2.03 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 1.16 to 3.14) for all manifestations of venous thromboembolism and 0.53 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 1.10) for CSVT. Nearly half of the recurrences occurred within the first year after discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy. Risk factors for recurrent venous thrombosis were male sex (adjusted hazard ratio, 9.66; 95% confidence interval, 2.86 to 32.7) and, for thromboses other than CSVT, severe thrombophilia resulting from antithrombin, protein C, protein S deficiency, anti-phospholipid antibodies, or combined abnormalities (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.34 to 16.5). Conclusions: The risk of recurrent CSVT is low and is higher in the first year after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment and among men. Mild thrombophilia abnormalities are not associated with recurrent CSVT, but severe thrombophilia entails an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism.   April 19, 2021 Follow up, no change in condition. Discussed case with Dr, will order Factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, anti phospholipid and anti cardiolipin antibodies, if she will allow draw. Expect Heparin Induced Thrombosis testing result tomorrow, but with no thrombocytopenia after given heparin, expect will be normal. Will await result. If discharged, would recommend 3 months direct thrombin inhibitor (Eliquis/Xarelto/Pradaxa) at full anticoagulation dose. Then stop, no taper. Overall still feel &#34;provoked&#34; thrombosis due to December Covid, unrelated to J&amp;J Covid vaccine, but can not definitively prove that..

I used my inhaler when I needed it and after three weeks it feels better and I no longer have any symptoms.

                                                On the 13th, I had a low grade fever and it never actually broke past 100. I spent most of the day in bed. Fatigued - and general was exhausted and tired .After that day, everything was pretty good. I had minor discomfort in my arm (that first day.) On the Friday, the 16th- my left arm - a third of my upper arm was bright red, swollen and hot to the touch and it was very painful. I reached out to a doctor for a chat with a doctor. The dr had me take 600 mg of Motrin and a Claritin and I took those based on the dosages allowed on the box, consistently for about 24 hours and after that it started getting a lot better.  I&#39;d say by Sunday the 18th, I was pretty much back to normal and everything resolved.  Doctor chat but not a regular doctor visit.

After I was home I felt extremely tired and that improved after i laid down for a bit. However, around 7 PM I became very cold and had a temperature of 100.3 with chills/shakes. It has lasted into the next day with chills being on and off. I experienced muscle cramps as well has some chest discomfort.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Injection site on arm hurt immediately after injection and upper arm is still sore today (3 days later). Approx 7 hours after receiving vaccine I experienced a sudden onset of overall body aches and joint pain specifically in my knees. It was kind of severe- even my skin was hurting when I got goosebumps. A fever came on after that and I was shivering, cold, sweaty. Approx 11 hours after injection I began to experience a severe headache and sleepiness. Symptoms continued overnight and disturbed my sleep, but were relieved somewhat by taking ibuprofen. By the next morning (after sleeping 14 hours) I was only feeling tired, arm soreness, and headache (no more fever, chills, body aches). All symptoms except arm soreness cleared up rather suddenly, approx 24 hours after they came on (which was approx 31 hours after injection).

Loss of consciousness lasted less than one minute, recovery took about twenty minutes to become stable to leave the facility; lingering ?wooziness? throughout the day. This reaction was more likely due to vasovagal syncope than the vaccine. Patient has a history of vasovagal syncope.  Arm soreness, fatigue, and headache presented the following day.

                                                Immediately experienced pain and soreness in arm upon administration of vaccine.  Started experiencing additional side effects 9-10 hours after vaccine administration:  at night I developed a severe migraine, nausea and chills.   When I woke up the next morning, I still had a migraine, my nausea was less apparent, but I did begin to experience fatigue/exhaustion and muscle aches.  I&#39;ve experienced chills and hot flashes in waves throughout March 11th.  I took my temperature for the first time at 4PM on March 11th and I have a low grade fever of 99.6. degrees Fahrenheit.

                                                Immediately after the vaccine I had extreme sleepiness and some dizziness. After taking a nap I felt better for a few hours. I did notice my Raynaud?s symptoms became way worse.  At about 5:30pm I started to feel extremely cold. By 6pm I was having horrible pains and spasms in my lower back and hips. My muscles and joints became very stiff. This moved to my neck/shoulders, and down my thighs. I lost feeling in my feet and started struggling to be able to take in a full breath. I felt like my whole body was locked up. I started feeling nauseous, but part of that may have been from the nerves. The next morning I felt a bit more mobile but still nauseous and stiff. I have slowly gotten better throughout the day, but am still stiff and exhausted

                                                About 7-8 minutes later I started feeling pressure in the  right side of my head. It went away a bit. I was walking after the 15 minutes and started feeling weird in my face, I just sat in my car and waited because I had to drive.  I started feeling numbness under my eye and down the rest of my face. The thing that worried me the most I had so much pressure under my eye like it was inside my brain.  The numbness and pain caused me to freak out.  I went to back to the convention center to let them know, they brought the Paramedic to me they started checking me and doing a work up. They told me I wasn&#39;t a life threatening emergency and my vitals were ok. They offered to take me to the ER and I declined and I decided to leave because I have been there for 1hr 45mins. I felt like my symptoms were at 70%. When I got home I freaked out again because the numbness didn&#39;t go away and my face looked like it was a little lower and had a panic attack and went to the ER. They checked on me and told me I didn&#39;t have a stroke. They told me It was a side effect to the vaccine. They told me to follow up with the Neurologist if I have any more symptoms, I have an appointment with them in a couple weeks. I&#39;m a little concerned because there is a minor pain that I didn&#39;t have before on my right side and it worries me.

My husband stacked 10&#43; blankets on top of me trying to get me to warm up.  I was running a fever of 103, and my heart rate was at 104 all night long.  My fever didn&#39;t break until shortly before 8:00 a.m. on Monday, March 15, 2021 but my heart rate stayed between 95 - 102 most of the day.  The body aches weren&#39;t too terrible, but I did have those.  I have bruising, puffiness, and swelling at the injection site.

                                                I had some slight arm pain the day of the shot, but the morning after my arm that received the injection was in so much pain that I could barely even move it. Very little mobility, slight bruising and a red circle around the injection site about 1.5 inches. However, I felt fine most of the entire day besides that. Around hour 28 of getting vaccinated I started to get very bad chills that lasted for about 3 hours. Took my temperature, which stayed around 100 degrees the entire night, 100.5 at its highest point that I checked. The next day it was standing in around 99.9. Felt slight muscle soreness the last couple days, but no fever since then. My arm gained a little mobility on Sunday, 2 days since vaccination so I thought it was getting better. but Monday and today (Tuesday) my knot/lump in my arm at the vaccination site is back to hurting extremely bad and the swelling and size of the lump and red circle is actually growing and pain is starting to increase again.  The red circle is around 4.5 inches now and the pain is sharper where the injection happened.  I am starting to get worried something is wrong, but will give it another day or so before checking in with a doctor.

She fell out of chair and hit her head on the clinic floor.  Staff responded to pt lying in the lobby floor with a quarter sized  red knot on left side of forehead. Pt complained of a headache, was found to be diaphoretic and had nausea and small amount of emesis but had moderate nausea for 30 minutes after event. Vitals were obtained and WNL. EMS was called and pt agreed to be transported to ER for evaluation.

I didnt feel well the remaineder of the day and laid down for bed around 7pm and woke up the next morning and all symptoms had subsided.  I was 16 weeks gestation at the time of the vaccine.

I had a bad headache, fever, chills, muscle aches, and nausea. I couldn&#39;t hold down water of food. At 10am the following day (3/21) I was able to take aTylenol and the fever came down. So far, I have taken Tylenol throughout the day and kept the fever down, however I still get bad night sweats and muscle aches. Today (3/23) I feel a little off, but much better.

I slept from 3:45 to 4:30 pm but was still tired and felt weak. I did feel hungry and made dinner over 30 minutes. However, this wore me out. I was even more tired and started getting dizzy. I almost fainted as I made my way to a chair to sit down. I couldn&#39;t eat because of slight nausea and cold chills. I was shaking for about 20 minutes. Eventually, I made it to my bed to lay down, but my legs were shaking as I walked up the stairs. At 6:00 pm, my temperature was 98.8 F. I was freezing a shivering for the next hour in bed under 3 blankets. My hands and feet felt like ice. At 8:00 pm, I had a fever of 100.2  F that lasted all night. My body ached all over, especially at the hips. I couldn&#39;t sit still and couldn&#39;t sleep until 4:00 am. I woke at 8:30 am with some milder aches and fatigue with a temperature of 97.6 F.

                                                Yesterday (3/31/21) after the shot (4:00pm) my arm at the injection site was sore.  This has continued into today.  No swelling or redness but my arm hurts to touch or move. Beginning this morning (4/1/21) around 7:30 am I started having a headache.  I took an ibuprofen which slightly lessened the pain but it has not gone away all day.  It worsens with activity. Starting around 8:30-9:00 am I started to feel nauseous and lightheaded.  I didn&#39;t take any medication for these symptoms.  They&#39;ve stuck with me all day. Starting around 11:30am I started to feel cold chills and body/muscle aches.  This has continued throughout the day. Starting around 2:45 pm I&#39;ve felt feverish, with severe cold chills.

She received her first COVID vaccine 8 hours prior. No cough. She felt well before the shot. No bleeding or leaking fluid. Her COVID test was negative. She was tachycardic to the 140&#39;s and the baby was tachycardiac to the 180&#39;s starting at presentation. She was treated with oral tylenol and IV fluids. After about 90 minutes of monitoring a prolonged fetal heart rate deceleration was noted to the 60&#39;s for 6 minutes. This recovered with repositioning. After another hour a reactive tracing was noted with a normal heartrate for baby. In induction of labor was started.

                                                About an hour after injection (~9:15am), I felt mild fatigue and a very mild headache. The fatigue progressed throughout the day and made me very exhausted. About 8 hours after the injection, I had chills, still fatigued, mild headache, and about an hour later I ran a low grade fever (about 99*).  Took Tylenol to keep my fever down. Temp shot back up to 101* a few hours later (still having body aches, fatigue and chills, and some mild nausea at this point.) My fever broke about 19 hours after the injection. 24 hours after the injection, the injection site was sore and I had a moderate headache with mild nausea. This continued throughout the day so I rested. 48 hours after the injection, still soreness in my upper left arm from the injection with mild headache, mild nausea and small lack of appetite. 72 hours after injection, completely back to normal with some soreness in my upper left arm at injection site.

                                                I awoke at 6:45 a.m. feeling a bit sore in my arm, but relatively okay.  I was up for approximately ten minutes and then extended my arms over my head to stretch out some of the achiness and immediately regretted the action.  I began to feel dizzy and nauseous and saw black spots encroaching on my peripheral vision.  I washed my face to relieve some discomfort with no change.  I walked toward the bedroom to grab my glass of water when the black spots increased, clouded my entire vision, and I collapsed on the bed.  I then began to hyper-salivate and after waking my husband and catching my breath, I returned to bathroom, experienced diarrhea, and simultaneously vomited into the trash can.  The vomit tasted chemical and extremely acidic.  My body was also shaking uncontrollably during this time and I kept switching between chills and being too hot.  After I felt comfortable leaving the bathroom, I crawled back in bed but was shaking so much that I couldn&#39;t stop my teeth from chattering and could not get warm no matter that my husband placed an extra blanket over me.  I had taken my temperature before while I was in the bathroom and it read 94.6 degrees Fahrenheit.  I took it again in bed about twenty minutes later and it read 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit.  My head was splitting and my arm ached, but I was eventually able to go back to sleep.  I felt better after sleeping for a few hours and drinking more fluids.

                                                Around 4 pm I was starting to feel a little sore. By 4:30 pm I had some major chills that turned into hot flashes. At around 4:30 pm I took 400mg of Ibuprofen. For 1 hour I was fighting a fever and chill spells that rapidly changed during that 1 hour time period, ending at 5:30 pm. Within that time I had major acks in my back and neck. I also experience sinus pressure and pins and needs in my ears and behind my ears. After 5:30 pm I did feel significantly better and now are 8:00 pm I feel exhausted, my head hurts and my ears feel like they weigh a pound each. Hope that was helpful. Thanks for doing what you&#39;re doing.

It became harder for me to breathe, but I never struggled to take a breath. I drank some water and waited for the symptoms to subside. I remained seated and these symptoms went away within 5 minutes. After feeling better for about 5 minutes, I felt cold and was shivering. The woman sitting next to me was completely fine after her shot. I&#39;ve since felt a slight burning sensation on my skin in areas that I have scratched lightly. I&#39;m also experiencing strange feelings throughout my body- specifically my head, leg, and hand. It feels like I can feel something in each area for a bit and then it subsides after several minutes.

                                                I had the Janssen covid shot yesterday. The shot stung a little and made my arm sore. Later on in the evening I became tired (so far nothing I didn&#39;t assume would happen) so I took a nap. When I woke up, my arm stung worse than when I had the shot and the pain kept shooting up my shoulder into my neck. I went back to sleep, thinking it was just normal vaccine stuff. When I woke up this morning, I had chills, a fever of 101.7, and muscle aches. My body feels like I have a sunburn all over it. My right arm feels like it was stung by a scorpion. I feel dizzy and nauseous, and I have head fog. I feel the exact same way I did when I had COVID19, but with my arm hurting so bad, anything that barely touches it (such as clothes) shoots a stinging pain up my neck

Later that day (around 6:00pm) I started feeling lightheaded, chills and a headache. My hands, feet, nose and hands were freezing but other areas of my body were warm. I also felt body aches- my lower back started with the aches and it spread up to my upper neck. Around 9:00pm I started feeling very hot and this hot/cold changes continued throughout the night. This morning of 4/9/2021 I have less of a headache however, my body is still very sore and I continue to experience the hot/cold changes.

Headache and nausea about four hours after shot. Fever of 102.6 about 7 hours after shot accompanied by chills/shaking worse than any fever I?ve had. Tylenol was taken around time of headache which may have delayed the fever and chills. Tylenol and ibuprofen were taken simultaneously every 5 hours starting that evening and throughout the night and all the next day. Food consumption was minimal due to nausea but hydration  was maintained.

It was like an asthma attack, but normally my asthma attacks are caused by a sinus infection. This was just shortness of breath and gasping for air.  I used my rescue inhaler with increasing frequency over the course of the following week. By March 12, I had to use my nebulizer. I used the nebulizer once on March 12, twice on March 13, twice on March 14, and I finally went to urgent care on March 15 when the nebulizer stopped helping. Urgent care was unable to help due to covid protocols, so they put me on oxygen for 5 minutes and transferred me to the ER.  At the ER, by the time I got to the ER, my breathing had normalized. I was given prednisone on site, as well as a prescription for 5 days. I had a chest xray done that returned completely normal.

By 7am when I got out of bed, it felt like a truck hit me. I had a major headache, very fatigue, fever (checked at this point and it was 101), nausea, hotness/chills. By 12pm, I had an 100 degree fever, chills/hotness, and headache. By 6pm, I was only tired. Next day, I was back to normal with a little soreness in my injection arm.

                                                About 6 hours after the shot, I started to have very bad chills followed by high fever and joints pain. All of these made it hard to sleep. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer to measure but it&#39;s probably the highest fever I ever had. There was a lower fever, headache,  joint pain, and fatigue the next day.  I didn&#39;t take any medicine just drank a lot of water and my body is back to normal the third day.

                                                I experienced a low-grade fever (100), muscle and joint pain, pain at the injection site, and fatigue during the first 24 hours after receiving the vaccine. A little less than 24 hours after the vaccine, my fever broke, and I began to develop a rash on my legs, which consisted of small, itchy, bug-bite like red bumps. I consulted my primary care physician, who recommended I take Benadryl. The rash worsened and spread to my torso - stomach, chest, underarms, and forearms - but was never present at the injection site. The rash on my chest was significantly different than the rest of my body, and when I saw an urgent care provider (5 days after being vaccinated), she diagnosed the chest rash as a separate issue (Folliculitis) and prescribed oral antibiotics. I saw no improvement in any symptoms. A week after being vaccinated and symptoms not improving, I saw my Allergist, who prescribed a 10-day course of oral steroids (Prednisone). My symptoms gradually improved, but the rash did not fully disappear for approximately 3 weeks after the first symptoms appeared.

                                                I had the usual fever that began in evening around 8pm, but before that I started developing leg cramping like growing pains behind my left knee. The growing pains persisted behind the left knee for two full days (requiring me to take Tylenol to sleep), then it began behind my right knee, as well. That lasted another 24 hours before the growing pains expanded to both calves, as well. The pain persisted for an entire week and would wake me up in the mornings. I began stretching and working out and now the soreness from my work outs mostly masks the growing pains. I believe today is the first day I am not experiencing the growing pains.

On April 1st I was exposed to someone who had Covid 19 and contracted it myself. I became symptomatic with congestion, cough, fatigue which all last until the 9th of April. On April 12th a rash began to breakout on my skin and I began to experience nausea. Today, April 13th, the nausea has worsen and the rash spread to my whole body. I am unsure of whether it is related to Covid or the vaccine.

The headache and all over muscle pain finally eased up last night. Breathing aches and I am still experiencing muscle weakness.

I started feeling nauseous about an hour later. Then at about 9:00 pm, I started to feel really sick. I felt very tired and my whole body hurt. I had a low body temperature, 95 degrees. Chills, fever, shaking, nausea. Very SEVERE symptoms. Felt very disoriented. I thought I was going to pass out and faint. Vision blurry and seen white.  Pounding headache. Ears ringing. I could hardly walk that night, I was crawling on the floor. I felt out of breath. My heart was beating very fast. My left side of my chest hurt by my ribs. When I did wake up from sleep, I woke up with blood in my mouth and dried blood on my lips.

                                                On Sunday, 4/11  my eyelids were tingling, it then went to my forehead, entire face and both of my arms. My muscles stiffened and my hands/thumbs were cramping inward. My hands were also red and blotchy during this time. My face was tight and hard to move or talk. This entire incident lasted in total around 20 minutes or so. I seem to be okay since that incident, I have had a headache off and on. Not sure if it?s related to the vaccine but I haven?t experienced anything like this before.

                                                The day I received the shot, I started to feel severe fatigue, headache, light-headed, and started running a fever about 6 hours after the shot was administered.  The next day (4/6) was worse. Severe fatigue, muscle aches, headache, loss of appetite, fever (101.5 was the highest I notice but seemed to be around 101.1-101.3 all day), and general flu like symptoms. However, I also started experiencing abnormal menstrual bleeding. I am on the Depo shot and have been for some time. Due to this, I do not usually experience any menstrual bleeding so I found this to be a little odd. It was not heavy but it was noticeable and contained quite a few clots.   Day 3 (4/7) was about the same except my fever came down and ranged from 99.8-101.1. Abnormal menstrual bleeding continued. New side effect this day included diarrhea.   Day 4 (4/8) I started to see improvement. No fever (that I could tell). Remaining side effects included mild headache, fatigue, diarrhea, and abnormal menstrual bleeding.   Day 5 (4/9), I had one of the worst nose bleeds I&#39;ve ever had in my life. I apologize for the graphic description but it lasted about 20 minutes and my bathroom looked like a crime scene after. Blood was pouring out of my left nostril and I threw two large clots that were about the size of slug (or slightly larger than a fun size snickers... I wish I had a better way to describe it). I&#39;ve had some bad nose bleeds, particularly when I was on Accutane, and this was worse! The rest of the day I felt like I was improving. Energy levels were better. No fever. Menstrual bleeding stopped. Only lingering side effect was mild headache and mild diarrhea.   Since then I&#39;ve continued to feel better and the diarrhea seems like it&#39;s improving.  Mild headache persists. Only new  item is an annoying twitch in my left eye that started on Monday (4/12).

                                                The week prior to delivery (3/22), I started feeling shortness of breath and a headache. I thought it was just normal pregnancy symptoms. That Friday (3/26), I noticed swelling in my ankles. I am a teacher so I asked my school nurse to check my blood pressure; it was high (for me) around 144/88. She said I should call my OB and let them know. I did, and they said to rest for the weekend and they&#39;d see me on Tuesday for my 29 week appointment.   We had a weekend trip planned. We took our son there. The next night, I didn&#39;t feel right. My belly felt hard to me and I wasn&#39;t feeling my daughter move as much, but soon after, I went to sleep. Our two year old son woke us up crying around midnight, and I noticed that I started bleeding when I went to the bathroom. My husband drove me straight to the emergency room. I was diagnosed with sudden and severe preeclampsia. My fibrinogen levels were 100% indicative of a placental abruption. They called the transport team in from hospital so they could transfer my daughter immediately after birth. At 5:57 am on 3/28, my daughter was born via emergency c-section. She is currently fighting everyday at the NICU in the hospital.  On Friday, 4/2 I was readmitted for severe preeclampsia to hospital. My blood pressure was 190/115. I had to receive another round of magnesium sulfate. I was released from the hospital on Sunday, 4/4.

Fever was not controlled well  by acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Cold sweats, headache, shivering and body aches continued for 2 days post vaccination along with periods of vertigo and light headedness. Episodes of vertigo/feeling dizzy and lightheaded to the point of needing to sit down continue at least once a day now 10 days post-vaccination.

                                                Atypical Headache 8 days post J&amp;J vaccine. Woke up with headache at 7:30am and the headache got progressively worse throughout the day. Headache symptoms included head pressure, ear pain, and generalized full body weakness. Went to urgent care at 6:00pm.  Due to ongoing health issues it was hard for the doctor to tell if it was a reaction to the vaccine or not at the time of exam. The doctor discharged me and recommend I go to ER if symptoms progress/get worse.

Grew to be about grapefruit sized in diameter, raised out of the skin like a large lump. Was red, and painful to the touch. Shrunk slowly over the course of the week, while still remaining painful and red. Tomorrow will be 2 weeks from vaccination, a lump still remains in the arm. Redness is gone, and slight pain remains when touched.

I was wearing a fitbit and then noticed my heart Rate went up to the 90s and fluctuated between 90-110 bpm all night into the next morning.  I woke up every 2 hours  to a new symptom on top of what I was feeling already. It started with chills, then sweating, nausea and  a headache. I had a fever of 99.5 at the highest. And then the last time I woke up at 5 my heart hurt so bad, my whole chest muscle hurt with a sharp pain and It hurt to breath.  The next day I had a little headache and my body hurt, and I had cramping in my legs for a few days, but I also started my menstrual cycle on the 13th.  The leg cramping continued for a few days but only when I sat on my legs for too long.

                                                I was tired the night of the shot and my arm was painful near the injection site, hard to move arm and touch caused great pain. My neck also started to lock up from my shoulder across to my spine and up my neck. This lasted about three days with occasional tension in the neck area coming back. Next morning I was very achy and my entire body felt like my muscles had a buildup of lactic acid. I did not have a fever but felt feverish that night. I felt the fever broke Saturday night/early Sunday morning (4/4) while I was asleep. I developed a slight cough for a few days and the muscle aches decreased by half each day. I felt mostly better after a week but occasionally felt tired and the cough lasted about a week. My arm developed a bolus at the injection site in the muscle that took about two weeks to go away, with occasional ice. The arm pain only lasted about 4 days before full range of motion was restored.

                                                I received the shot on Saturday, March 6th. Flu-like symptoms developed 12 hours after (aches, chills, extreme fatigue) and lasted about 12 hours -- pain in left arm lasted a full five days. On Thursday March 11th I started to develop a cold sore on my chin which was followed by malaise and swollen glands. I treated it with Zovirax. On Wednesday March 17th I developed what looked to be a pimple in the middle of my left eyelid. There was a small white/ fluid filled head about the size of a pin head. Over the next three days, three more fluid-like blisters the size of a pin-head began to develop on upper eyelid. By Tuesday March 23rd, I had over half a dozen fluid filled blisters that were painful and began to crust. The blisters extended from upper eyelid to below the brow (only on left side of face). On Tuesday March 23rd I went to the eye doctor. The eye doctor had asked if I ever had shingles (I have had the chicken pox vaccine, but never had chicken pox nor shingles). I have had HSV-1 since childhood and get the yearly cold-sore when stressed or immunity is low, but I never have had cold sores appear anywhere else other than lip/chin area. The doctor had suspected the eye blisters were a form of herpes and prescribed me 14 days of Valacyclovir. The blisters only affected the skin-- not the cornea or inside eye. Within a day and a half of the antivirals medication, the blisters were fully crusted over and started to clear up.

Headache was &#34;like I never had before&#34;, &#34;it&#39;s really painful.&#34; When I asked if this was the worst headache of her life she responded &#34;probably.&#34;  No photophonia, no phonophobia, no nausea, and no vomiting, which she gets every time she has migraines. &#34;This is a different type of headache,&#34; she said.  &#34;I usually throw up and my headaches get better.&#34; This headache feels like a &#34;balloon in my head.&#34; She reported vision changes (blurred vision) 45 minutes prior to our visit which started at 8:19 a.m. on April 21, 2021. (&#34;I was having a problem with peripheral vision, about 45 minutes ago,&#34; but not so much now. Patient denies loss of balance (dizziness), seizures, focal weakness, radicular symptoms, saddle anesthesia, sensory changes, slurred speech, numbness, chills, and fever. She was sent to the emergency department for further evaluation. She is a female patient with new, severe headache that is between 18 and 48 years of age, and has received the Ad26.COV2.S (COVID-19) vaccine within 3 weeks of headache onset.

On the third day previous symptoms went away and I got an extreme head cold, congestion, tiredness, lethargic. My varicose veins have been midly painful but it might be from laying all day for a week. On day five I started my menstrual cycle two weeks early, it was completely black and clumpy (not normal). It is now day 10 and I still have a slight cold, very tired, and am still on my period.

I?m bleeding in my urine, stool, and vaginally. Period came early (unrelated to previous vaginal bleeding) and is not clotting. Just significant amounts of red blood, soaking through one ultra absorbency tampon an hour. I have a headache. Went to the ER and my platelets were (345) and my blood sugar low. My bp was 145/90 which is high for me, from the bleeding.  They said I have a ?higher chance of being bitten by a shark? than having a side effect. They diagnosed me with a single contusion and sent me home. Have been feeling worse since leaving the hospital.

It?s gotten much better, but I still have a very small lump there. I was seen on April 19th for constant pounding in my left ear that started around April 12th. I was told I had pulsatile tinnitus, and I will be having a MRA scan on May 8th. I have felt some pressure in my head since then, and was told it may be related, but to just wait for the scan.

                                                At the time of injection, it was pretty painful and thus sent my body into a shock less than 5 mins after receiving my dose. My vision went white and I was very light-headed and hot/sweaty.  A nurse came with me outside to monitor and I was feeling back to normal in 15 minutes. This is something that happens when I experience a high amount of pain, so just reporting for others who maybe have low blood pressure issues.  At about 8pm, other side effects started to set in. I first experienced a headache, then experienced soreness/ache-y-ness  in my back. Around 8:30, I started to feel light headed again and soon my whole body felt ache-y. I quickly developed chills where I felt so cold that I was uncontrollably shaking and felt very sore/stiff. I have been laying under a heated blanket for the last hour and a half and am finally feeling better with no more shaking  or chills. I still have soreness throughout my body and a headache, but I took ibuprofen around 8:30pm.

Around 9 pm I started experiencing extreme body aches all over that felt like my body was &#34;fighting&#34; against itself. I also experienced chills. I had a hard time sleeping from the pain. The next morning a headache started and progressed into a migraine. I could not get up or open my eyes from how bad the migraine was. I took extra strength Tylenol for the pain with little relief. On Saturday evening the symptoms started to get better and turned more into a headache. I still had the headache on Sunday but it was better after taking the Tylenol. On Monday my arm is now sore (it wasn&#39;t sore prior).

                                                Around 3:15 in the afternoon, I began experiencing severe aches and muscle pains, combined with a growing migraine. Not realizing what it may be related to, I took two ibuprofen and I&#39;ve acetaminophen.  By the time I around home around 6:30, I could barely hold myself up. I ate dinner, which only helped minimally, and by 8 pm felt like death. My husband notice I looked red and felt my forehead, immediately going for the thermometer. I had a fever of 100.5.  We eventually got me into bed after downing a lot of water, but the pain would not ease up. The pain was too excruciating. At 10:30 my husband came to bed and we took my temp again which was 101.6. To help me sleep I took another Tylenol. At 5:45 my work alarm went off and I checked my temp again; still 101.6. I got a cold pack for my migraine and went back to sleep. Slowly throughout the day my fever dwindled, until it finally broke in the early afternoon. By 4:15, as I am writing this, all that&#39;s left is done tiredness, thirst, and a small bit of achiness.

Fever is continuing today (3/11/2021), but is lower at 100.4F. Tingling fingers on hand from vaccination arm (left), swelling from vaccination injection site, headache, and neck pain all developed on 3/10/2021.  Headache and neck pain could be due to head trauma from vasovagal syncope. Tingling fingers were not observed on 3/11/2021.    *I have had vasovagal syncope in the past, but never with vaccines. It always occurs when I see my own blood.

I took two pills of extra strength Tylenol and water and laid back down to break the fever and help with the aches and pains. I woke up around 9:30am on 3/13/21 and did not have and appetite all day. I was extremely fatigued all day and had no energy to get out of bed or do much.  On 3/14/21 I began to develop an appetite again around noon. I was still fatigued. My arm was very tender and itchy at the injection site and hurt to the touch. My 5:00pm on 3/14/21 I had more energy and the aches were gone but my arm was still hurting and sore.

Sunday continued with fever, down to 100.8, body aches, and fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea. Her temperature this morning was 99 and was she was feeling much better. Treatment was not needed.

                                                I started feeling subtle flu-like symptoms about 6 hours after receiving shot. At first I thought it was in my head but by the early evening I felt like I had a full blown fever even though I never actually had a fever at any point.  I had chills, muscles aches, head aches, and extreme fatigue. My back hurt especially and overall I felt very weak. I also had pain at the injection site that got worse the following day. I had trouble even lifting my arm to reach a drink just a few feet away from me.  The arm soreness lasted through the Monday following my vaccination (I received it on a Friday). All my symptoms were at their worst on Saturday. I felt much better on Sunday but still had the arm pain through Monday. Motrin did help relieve the worst my symptoms. I thought that was the end of my symptoms but that last week I have noticed what I believe to be a lingering fatigue from the vaccination. While it&#39;s not usual for me to feel tired at points throughout the day, I have been feeling a heavier and more full body fatigue than I usually experience. I have had to take naps more often, sometimes multiple times in a day.  During these bouts of fatigue, my whole body feels heavy and somewhat weak. It&#39;s similar to the exhausted feeling someone might have after they&#39;ve been crying for a while but I haven&#39;t been crying or emotionally taxed in anyway.  Normally when I wake up in the morning, I might feel tired for the first 30 minutes to an hour but once I get moving, I feel better and more alter. I have been having a harder time feeling rested or awake in the mornings and even if I get more sleep than normal, I still feel exhausted. I did not change my routine or diet which I why I think this is related to the vaccine.

                                                Around 8 hours after the shot I started to experience fatigue, body aches, uncontrollable body shakes, blueish lips and sweating (which to me indicated I had a fever). After taking some Advil my lips returned to normal and the body shakes stopped although it was hard to regulate my body temperature. I was sweating but felt cold. The worst of the symptoms seemed to last around 13 hours after they had started (so about 7pm on 3/25 to about 8am on 3/26). It&#39;s now been around 30 hours and I&#39;m feeling better but still fatigued and have soreness in my left arm where I received the injection.

                                                I received the vaccine at 1:30 pm in the afternoon on 3/22/21 and immediately afterwards I felt fine. I waited my 15 minutes and had no signs of a reaction and was free to go. Later in the afternoon, around 3:15 pm, I began to feel a little fatigued and my arm was sore. Around 6:00 pm that same night, I developed a low grade temp of 99.8, I was very fatigued, had achiness all over, as well as my arm was very warm and tender.  I was unable to sleep through the night of 3/22/21 into 3/23/21 and got out of bed around 4: 30 am on 3/23/21 and had to call into work due to the pain. The pain was not an achiness but sharp throughout my whole body. Around 9:00 am, I took a pain reliever and was able to sleep for a few hours. Upon waking up around 1:30-2:00 pm, I was still hurting and was then nauseated as well. I tried to drink water and ate a few crackers to settle my stomach with no relief. At 5:15 pm on 3/23/21, I went to the bathroom and got in the shower to try to help with the pain. After a few minutes in the shower, I became extremely lightheaded and felt like I was going to be sick. I sat down in the bathtub and hollered for my mother to come help me because at this point, I felt like I needed to go to the hospital. Upon sitting down in the bathtub, I began to profusely vomit and started to lose feeling in my legs. My mother entered the bathroom and I explained what was happening and soon after my hands contracted and were stuck in an abnormal position. The pain was unbearable and I was unable to move them from that position. I was unable to get myself out of the bathtub so my mom then called for an ambulance. These symptoms occurred somewhere around 5:20-5:21 pm and EMS was called at 5:22 pm. After a few minutes, I was able to regain movement of my legs but my hands and fingers were still contracted and unmovable. I was able to help my mother enough to put my clothes on and to make my way outside to the front porch to get fresh air. After getting outside, I was accompanied by my mother and my neighbor whom is a nurse. My neighbor looked at my hands and noticed they were discolored and she attempted to straighten out my fingers to no avail. The pain in my fingers was sharp and excruciating but there was also a pins and needle type pain as well. I remained outside until EMS arrived. I was then transported to Hospital where I was seen in the ER for this. Upon arrival to the ER, the physician ordered labs and fluids and stated that apparently he had seen at least 2 other cases that day with a similar reaction to the vaccine. He explained that I was having an adverse reaction to the vaccine and that my hands should return to normal within 24-48 hours. I was then discharged home. As of 3/24/21, I was able to straighten my left hand out and my right hand, my fingers would straighten out, but they would return to a curled resting position. As of 3/25/21, I returned to work and I have some weakness in both hands with a slight discoloration of each hand as well. I am a nurse and work in an office and the physicians in my office commented on the color of skin upon seeing them. I was still very achy and fatigued. My arm was still sore and tender as well. As of today, 3/26/21, I am still achy as well as tired. My right hand has improved some but still returns to a curled resting position. The color of my hands has improved as well. I am a nurse and have seen many things throughout my career. This experience has been absolutely terrifying and I still have no answers as to why this happened to my body. I did my part by being vaccinated and was terrified that I was going to lose my life to it. I pray this does not happen to anyone else.

                                                I began to feel bad 6 hours after the application of the vaccine with chills, stiffness, muscle and body pain. I already imagined that the fever was starting. 3 hours later I got home and took my temperature, it was 101 F.   the fever lasted more than 15 hours. I didn?t  take any medication. I put cold cloths on my head, bathed and rested. the headache was very intense. So far I have discomfort from that but the fever has already stopped. The most striking thing was the allergic reaction that I began to have around midnight and it continued until today. they were hives all over the body. swelling and itching and redness. Finally after 24hs after vaccine I took an anti allergy called levocetirizine  cause itching won?t stop.

                                                Six hours after I received the vaccine the most intense pain I&#39;ve ever felt in my life took over my entire body and has not stopped for a moment 20 hours later. It&#39;s particularly bad in my legs, knees, and elbows. There&#39;s also a fever but the pain is much worse.  I have a high pain tolerance but I&#39;m not kidding when I say this is unbearable. Breaking a bone hurts less. Actual COVID hurt less. This is agony.

The fever got worse overnight and I woke up repeatedly with a higher than normal heart rate and a severe migraine that lasted throughout the next day. I took Tylenol (two doses, 12 hours apart) to some relief.

I also suffered from extreme body aches, fatigue, nausea, upset stomach, diarrhea. This lasted a full 24 hours before my fever went away. The following day I still had an upset stomach. I also developed a red welt at the injection site which lasted for about a week, was red, swollen, bruised and itchy. 11 days later I tested positive for COVID19 and had full fledged symptoms of COVID19 as well.

I then had severe flu like symptoms overnight, including chills, and feeling hot and cold at the same time.  I woke up with a headache. I had muscle pains through the entire ordeal.  At 7am the next day, I took 600mg of ibuprofen and took a walk. I then felt fine.

Fever would not break until later that evening even when taking one Tylenol every four hours. Day two I couldn&#39;t tell if I was actually looking at myself in the mirror. I was dizzy and felt high. I could not remember simple tasks I just did like washing my face in the shower. I felt like I was hallucinating. I went to urgent care and they had no recommendations. I was to take the LSAT today, Saturday, April 9. I had to cancel it because I&#39;m still not fully coherent. I still feel dazed and out of it. I tried to go to work yesterday and old lasted an hour. I had a COVID test performed yesterday on my own accord, not per the request of urgent care, just in case I caught it prior to the vaccine without knowing, and it was negative. I can remember things now at least but I&#39;m still not mentally coherent. It&#39;s a scary feeling. I am about three and a half days post vaccine and slowly becoming myself again. I still feel dazed but I am able to have a conversation and remember it.

                                                Within an hour of receiving the vaccine I had lightheadedness and dizziness. I had mild bouts of nausea with this episode. The dizziness subsided close to 1 pm. At approximately 4 pm I was lethargic, and starting to run a fever with arm pain at the injection site. By 7pm I had no energy, small cough, fever (unknown), chills, and headache. This lasted until 10 AM the next day. Headache lasted until 5 pm the next day.

Once I was done freezing and with the fever it felt like my skin was on fire. I was in so much pain that night that I couldn&#39;t move without crying. After I slept that night and about 7 hours the next day I finally started to feel better.

                                                I had immediate soreness after the vaccine does. Then at 7pm of the evening after getting my vaccine, I began to feel weak, get chills, and run a low grade fever. At midnight, my fever had increased to 101 and I began taking Tylenol (recommended by Pharmacy). I had sever body aches, muscle fatigue, joint paint, chills and nausea through the night and the next day. In the morning, I had excruciating pain in my abdomen and began vomitting. Later that  day, my fever increased to 102.7 (with Tylenol) and I called my regular doctor. She told me to continue to monitor and if my fever did not decrease by 7pm to go the hospital. Finally, my fever decreased to 101, muscle aches, chills and joint pain continued. I began vomitting uncontrollably for a short period of time. I was very dizzy and weak the remainder of the day. Saturday, my fever finally broke (I sweated all day) but my body was still weak and sore. I also had dizzy spells on and off. Sunday, I felt much better but was still very tired compared to my normal self. I had abdomen pain and burning on and off. I also got hive on my hands Sunday afternoon. After Benadryl, the hives went away but I still felt itchy all over.  Today (Monday), I still don&#39;t feel like myself, but it is the best I have felt since receiving the vaccine. I have never experienced anything like this and was miserable Thursday night, Friday and some of Saturday. It truly was a terrible experience.

I also had a severe headache and pain and swelling at the injection site. The next day, the fever broke (about halfway through the day) and my fatigue lightened. I was still experiencing a minor headache and continued pain and swelling at the injection site. The third day, I woke up feeling normal, until I engaged in physical activity. The fatigue returned, however I am no longer experiencing a headache and the pain in my arm has lessened considerably. The swelling hasn?t reduced.

                                                4/6: The vaccine burned as it went in. The nurse at the Pharmacy administering the vaccine made the comment: &#34;Oh, that&#39;s weird. Everyone who has gotten this batch (Johnson&amp;Johnson) today have complained of burning.&#34; 4/7: Experienced severe body aches, chills, nausea, sweat, and vomiting. Headache that lasted all day.  4/8- 4/9: A mild headache that waxed and waned. 4/10: After drinking four alcoholic drinks between 10A to 2P, about an hour apart each, I became violently ill. By the second drink I felt a little sick but passed it off for being outside in the sun. Not being told that we shouldn&#39;t drink after the vaccine I didn&#39;t consider that I shouldn&#39;t. Throughout the day I experienced several blackouts, nausea, chills and a severe headache that lasted until 2A until I was finally able to go to sleep. This was absolutely terrifying as I have never experienced anything like this. I have bits and pieces completely gone of this day. I did not drink enough to black out, nor have I ever experienced blackouts or ever drank enough to cause me to black out. I do believe this is connected directly to the vaccine. 4/11: The headache remained as well as dizziness and nausea. 4/12: The headache waxed and waned along with the nausea. 4/13: I still have a headache and mild nausea.

I had full body chills, I was shaking back and forth, my head was pounding so hard it felt like someone had a hammer to it, I got in a hot bath and it felt ice cold to me, I was throwing up, couldnt lay down because every part of my body that was touching something was in terrible pain.  Could not sleep.  The next day I had all of the same symptoms except I was sweating a lot along with everything else.  These symptoms lasted three full days.  It has now been exactly three week, I still have pain in my arm the shot was is, it hurts to raise it.  I also still have an incredibly awful headache that will not go away, I hadn&#39;t had a headache is years and years prior to this, I overall have not felt well ever since I got the shot and my reaction was incredibly awful.  Now I have concerns about my headache and body aches that still are not subsiding.

My back began to hurt and that then moved into my neck and muscles as a whole with a little headache. The next morning I took Tylenol which I then started to feel a little better but  then at approx 3PM, my muscles began to hurt again, I took another tylenol which did not seem to help and felt nauseated. I then took a shower hoping it would help, but instead thew up after getting out. For the remainder of the night - my overall body felt week and standing up for long periods, I felt dizzy.

                                                Headache (turned into a migraine), extremely drained of energy, lack of appetite, and felt off all day (4/9/21). The next morning (4/10/21) felt the same as the day before, however, had several episodes where I would get really light headed, dizzy, and nauseous. Went to Home Depot at 2:15pm (4/10) and while there my vision blurred and started to fade, I had ringing in my ears and couldn?t hear out of the right and barely was able to hear out of the left. I got very nauseous and I couldn?t breath. I managed to sit on something and put my head between my legs that helped. Fortunately my step- dad was with me and helped me outside while I could barely see and hear and he stated I was very pale. I was having a hard time talking or being conherent. Once outside the symptoms slowly cleared over about the next 6-7 hours. At 4:45pm my mom decided to take me to the doctor but the walk in had just closed and I went to the ER. They stated I had elevated d-dime and did a chest CT scan  to check for blood clots around 7:30pm (I believe not sure exact time) doctor stated they came back clear but when asked if he suspected that the episode and symptoms were due to a dissipated blood clot he would not directly answer it. I overheard him dictating his notes and he started he beloved as such. I have never experienced anything like this before. I still felt drained, headache (migraine), occasionally dizzy, and lack of appetite (4/11/21, 4/12/21) and still currently feel the same drained, migraine, lack of appetite, and occasionally dizzy.

I had several spells of dry heaving that morning and a headache and body aches most of the day . I had soreness at the injection site for about a week.

                                                Per patient: I received the J&amp;J covid vaccine on April 5th. The following day I was dizzy, tired, running a fever, and my injection site was very sore. I could not lift my arm above my head without being in pain. I was not able to eat anything the entire day. I attempted to eat some soup but threw it up. I woke up at 3am on Wednesday morning and drank some water but within 10mins I threw that up along with blood. At one point when I checked my temperature it was 104.8. By Wednesday afternoon I was still not able to eat anything but I was able to drink Gatorade. My fever did not break until Thursday afternoon. I was able to go back to work on Friday but my arm still hurt and was red and swollen. The injection site began to itch on Friday and continued all weekend. On Sunday my hand of the arm that had the injection got swollen for about an hour. It is now Tuesday of the week following my vaccine and I feel fine but my injection site is now purple.

                                                Woke up between 10:30 and 11pm night of vaccine administration with full body shaking and shortness of breath. It?s unclear if shortness of breath was a direct result of the severity or the shaking or something else underlying the shakes. Walking or standing for any period of time was nearly impossible. I felt too warm and too cold at the same time and felt myself sweating but also shivering. My temperature was 99.6 (high for me - I?m usually low, around 96-97 on average) which persisted until around 5:30-6am the following morning. A severely painful, throbbing headache was present until well into the next evening. The symptoms of the headache did subside with use of OTC extra strength Tylenol (2 oral every 6 hours, taken twice totally 4 over the course of 24 hrs) but the headache was still felt somewhat even with use of Tylenol. Moderate fatigue was present all of 4/9 and until around mid morning of 4/10. Pain at the injection site was present but only noticed if laying on the affected arm (left) or if the site was accidentally touched. Dull aching at the site was felt on occasion until the following Monday, 4/12. All other symptoms had fully subsided by 4/10. As of today, 4/13, I am symptom free but I have noticed that I am taking deep breaths every once in a while (maybe several times an hour) as if I?m trying to catch my breath/I can?t catch a full satisfying breath. It feels somewhat like breathing through a straw for a few moments and I breath in until a full breath ?catchs?.

                                                About 7 hours after injection, I got full body chills. I also felt slightly woozy and a little loopy, but that only lasted about 4-5 hours. (In addition, my body felt a little stiff and my hamstrings got really sore, but I think it was directly related to a squat workout I did the previous day.) My temperature was 99F.  I woke up every 2 hours from my sleep. The chills lasted about 10 hours after their onset.  I took Tylenol at the 10 hour mark, and then the chills stopped. Hamstring soreness also subsided.

In the early morning I also got stomachache cramps and felt hungry, but food didn?t help. It actually made me feel nauseous. By 6am the next day I had a serious migraine too - sensitivity to light. My eyes hurt. It actually was so bad I caved and took 2 liquid Advil?s to help with the pain. From there I slowly got better over the day but still had the above mentioned symptoms, just less intense. Around 8pm the fever came back and I called it a night.  Next morning I felt better, but still tired. Still had a headache but not a migraine. And occasional stomach aches. It?s now 2 days later and the head aches, arm soreness and occasional stomach aches have not gone away.

                                                Headache that night of the shot (within an hour or two of the shot). That lasted until Thursday evening and going into Friday. I didn&#39;t wake up with it. I took 600 mg of Ibuprofen at bedtime on Wednesday. Didn&#39;t wake up with the headache Thursday. I started getting  body aches all over my body on Wednesday and they got worse until about 2:30 and I took a 15 min nap and woke up and felt a little better but I had them all the way to bedtime. And I was cold. That was until 1:00 PM on Wednesday. Wednesday night at 06:00 pm, on my left foot from arch to my toes I had a hot sensation. I thought one of my pets had pied on my foot - hot and wet feeling. But they didn&#39;t. That  has been happening frequently and intermittently and I am still experiencing them. The level of heat has decreased - it it warm and wet instead of hot and wet feeling. Happens frequently throughout the day. On Friday, I noticed, I had a rash on my left forearm. I noticed it on Friday evening and that went away on Thursday of last week after I was able to be hydrocortisone ointment on it for a few days. The rash was really itchy.

                                                My first side effects were fatigue and feeling ?out of it?, which started about 2 hours after the injection. At 7 hours after my left leg became numb and a little sore. I started to notice a feverish, tingly feeling on my skin and this would last at least 24 hours. These symptoms quickly spread through my whole lower body. The chills and intense body aches started at 11 pm. I woke up at 2 am that night and had a low grade fever 99.9 F. I took 2 pills of Tylenol. The fever broke around 3:30 or 4 am and I slept through the rest of the night. The next morning 3/09, I felt fatigue, slow, and woozy. I still had chills and muscle aches, although the intensity was less. Halfway through the day the chills intensified, the muscle aches became more severe, and my eyeballs felt like they were burning in the back of my head. By that evening, the fever was back and I couldn?t think straight. My legs ached with a pain that I?ve never felt before. I did not have a severe headache, but I felt that if I exerted myself too much I would get one. My partner said I could barely form coherent sentences, and I was so weak I couldn?t sit up straight. I took 2 more Tylenol that night, went to bed and slept through the whole night. The morning of 3/10 I woke up feeling tired but my skin did not have that feverish feeling. I was no longer sick. On 3/11 I woke up and did my normal morning routine. I ate an egg, some of a Nutella stuffed scone, and drank coffee and water. I took my 3 pills, loratadine, omeprazole, and a probiotic, and I had a severe allergic reaction within 5 minutes of taking the pills. For the next 10 minutes my breathing became labored and wheezy. I experienced severe eosinophilic esophagitis symptoms. For the next week, my EoE symptoms were heightened. I had a reaction after drinking a seltzer water, which does not usually affect me. Within 2 weeks I was back to normal and to my knowledge have not experienced any other related side effects.

                                                Within 12 hours of vaccine, I experienced fever, chills and sweats. I awoke from my sleep at this point, which was 4AM Friday morning. During the day on Friday, I experienced major fatigue and lethargy and had no emotional symptoms, save for being slightly annoyed/irritated about my condition. I began menstruation on Friday, April 9. Further, I slept 4pm-8pm, did some computer work from 9pm-3am, and went back to sleep. These symptoms were expected. Saturday&#39;s symptoms were not expected, regardless of onset of menstruation, and are what I would consider the adverse event. All day Saturday, I experienced massive melancholy, sadness, hopelessness, and general emotional angst. This is not normal for me, even during my period; I experienced this affect consistently years ago, from 2015-2017, when I was originally diagnosed with depression. Since 2017/2018, I have been in a much healthier emotional state, and have used an SSRI for the last 6 months with success. The following day, Sunday, I began a monophasic combination birth control, which was an original plan prescribed by a physician.  Following this, I experienced roughly 7-10 days of adverse emotional response, namely anger and aggression and mood swings, until I stopped using the new birth control on April 22. My emotional wellbeing took this roughly 7-10 days to recover. The mood change I experienced on Saturday, April 10, based on my previous experiences, was more similar to the mood change I experienced while being depressed rather than the mood change I experience from menstruation and PMS. I strongly request thoughtful consideration of the impact of the vaccine on short-term emotional and mental health changes. I was able to recover from it, and I believe that was because of my experience dealing with depression and mood swings in years past.

I was fine early in the morning and then stated feeling nausea and I vomited 3 times and was unable to retain fluids or food. Everything I tried to consume something I would throw it up.  The vomiting and Dehydration was the worst, I had nausea in my first trimester so not sure if it&#39;s linked to my pregnancy.  I called my OB and spoke with them on the phone, they were concerned at on point but eventually was able to hold down an Gatorade and Tylenol . The other effect I had were mainly fatigue and headache but Tylenol helped with both of those.  I still feel tired but other than that no other symptoms.  By Friday evening I was feeling fine, the only thins that carried on was fatigue. I didn&#39;t experience  site pain, no redness, swelling or hurting.

Felt lethargic and fatigue for approximately 48 hours after the vaccine. Also had some menstrual bleeding which was brief on 3/5/21, which was the date of the vaccine, and this was not expected. Alternated Tylenol and Ibuprofen after vaccine to help lower fever, and drank fluids.

Once the fever broke, fatigue and headache persisted until 3/10/21.

I have since being running a fever, breaking out in a sweat, had a severe migraine, and body aches and joint aches. It has been over 24 hours since the vaccine and am still having side affects.

Symptoms seem gone today, approximately 30 hours after symptom onset. Injection site tenderness persists, but is only noticeable if I poke it.

                                                Immediately after the injection and for the next 36 hours, I had soreness in my right arm where the injection was.  Around 8:15pm, I started to develop chills. From there, I developed a fever, headache, neck soreness and body aches in my joints (particularly wrists, knees, elbows). I contained the fever with extra strength Tylenol taken according to the box instructions. The fever broke overnight.  I had a 99 degree temperature the next day (3:00 pm) after the vaccine, and experienced fatigue and body aches. Those symptoms largely subsided by the morning of 3/21.   I still (as of the PM on 3/22) have no appetite and a persistent feeling of &#34;fullness&#34; in my stomach.

By 4pm I had a headache, body aches, upset stomach, tired, fever, and chills. My fever would go up and down, highest was 103.2 reached that temp 3 times. By 2am my mother drove me to the ER. I was diagnosed with a migraine and was given IV fluids and an IV migraine cocktail. After receiving the fluids and meds I felt much better and was released back home. I periodically have pain in the injection site.

I pulled down my visor and used the mirror to look at my face and chest area and noticed red splotches all over. The rash quickly moved to cover my whole body within minutes of receiving the vaccine. Ochsner had me pull over by the EMT tent and I waited 45 additional minutes to see if I had any other effects. The rash didn&#39;t go away but I didn&#39;t itch and I wasn&#39;t uncomfortable. It was just a surface rash. The rash was completely gone by 10PM that same night. I woke up at 2AM that same night/early the next morning and the whole left side of my body was numb and felt very heavy. I also had a very mild fever and cold like symptoms. These symptoms included chills, dizziness, fatigue, and headaches. All of my symptoms, including the pain and heaviness on my left side, were gone the following morning which was about 36 hours after first receiving the vaccine.

I went to a dark room and about 30 minutes later it stopped where a wasn&#39;t seeing a flashing line.  I took melatonin and went to bed figuring I was starting to get tired.  I woke up at 638am. Arm super sore, a red spot over the size of a quarter at injection site. Low grade 99.1 and my entire body hurts and a small headache. Called in to work to rest for the day.

A few minutes later she fainted and fell out of the chair onto the floor. We helped her up to a sitting position and gave her a bottle of water and an ice pack.  The right side of her forehead appeared red from apparent hit on the floor when she fainted.  We had her wait on the floor for about 30 minutes to ensure she remained conscious.  Patient reported an ache on her forehead at site of hit.  She was also sweating and reported feeling hot. Patient had a partner with her who agreed to escort her to an urgent care clinic in the same building as the pharmacy. Store manager in charge took the patient to the urgent care clinic by wheelchair to be examined.

Restlessness and chills continued throughout the night. At 1:30am I finally took OTC flu/cold liquid medicine. (NyQuil) and then continued DayQuil and NyQuil for the next 48 hours.  Fever began and continued until end of day the following day. Although not as serve once fever reducer was being taken. (24 hours) Body aches that night and continuing into the next day. (24 hours) Headache began the next day and continued for almost 48 hours post injection.  Fatigue that night and continued for two days post injection (48 hours) All around would categorize day one after the inject as &#34;flu-like&#34; although this was a bit worse than when I&#39;ve had the flu. Day 2 post injection was more &#34;cold-like&#34; but higher fatigue than I&#39;m used to.  I normally never get headaches, and I had a dull headache for the two days post injection.

                                                At 3 am this morning I felt fever, body ache, and headache, I took 2 tylenol at 5am and went back to sleep, woke up around 7:30. Since 10 am I&#39;ve been feeling so much pain in my stomach. Haven&#39;t taken any medication because I&#39;m afraid it can get worst

                                                Approximately 10 hours after injection I became tachycardic--on average experienced a heart rate of 100-120 bpm (resting hearting rate is 65-70 bpm) which continued for 6 hours.  This occurred at the same time as fever (highest 99.4 degrees F) and muscular aches in back and legs. After consulting with doctor, I took a combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen and  half a dose of  metoprolol to lower fever and heart rate.  Experienced a slight headache and had trouble sleeping due to tachycardia.  Tachycardia dissipated 6 hours after onset. All symptoms resolved by 12 PM the next day (approximately 24 hours after injection).

After about an hour of pain and three Tylenol quick release tablets, the fever broke. The full body  pains and lethargy lasted around 30 hours in total.

Around 6 pm the night of my shot on April 1 I started with a headache, that progressed into a migraine, chills, fever. Tylenol was not helping. The next morning I called my doctor because the tylenol was not helping and they prescribed fioricet to bring my fever down and take the migraine away. Migraine went away later that night April 2, 2021 but felt weak that night into the next day.

Concerned my bone was hit with a too long vaccine needle. Had chills/fever evening of 4/4/2021 into morning of 4/6/2021?had to take off work. Have had neurological symptoms ongoing with ?brain fogginess? since 4/5/2021. On 4/6/2021, began to see flashes/spots of light in vision of left eye, which worsened through today. Took off afternoon from work and went to an eye clinic to have eye dilated and looked at, but the spots in vision continue through reporting time (4/7/2021, 5pm CT).

                                                12 hours after injection I was shivering freezing using multiple blankets. When I tried to walk I was very dizzy with blurred vision. I had body aches and a severe headache. My temperature was 104.7 with the thermometer. My breathing was as if I worked out but was just sleeping. I called an ambulance and was taken to health center where doctor took over care.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after shot, I experienced sudden onset of extreme fatigue, extreme muscle aches and joint pain, slight headache, and 103 degree fever. The muscle pain and joint pain were so intense that it was difficult to be still and caused me to constantly try to shift positions. After 4 hours of running a fever (12 hours subsequent to shot) the fever fell to 100.1. The extreme muscular pain also diminished around the same time that the fever reduced. The fever stayed between 99.9 and 100.6 for the next 12 hours and achiness, joint pain, and fatigue remained but were comparatively milder. All symptoms were gone 28 hours after the shot. I did NOT take any pain relievers or medications during the time that I experienced symptoms.

Immediately after being vaccinated, pt. requested to remain seated.  The nurse noted that the pt. was getting pale so she suggested the pt. take off the surgical mask to get some air.  Before pt. had a chance to take off the mask she lost consciousness.  Together with another nurse patient was lowered onto the floor.  Pt. regained consciousness for 30-45 seconds and then began to have seizure like activity.  Her eyes rolled back and her body became stiff and began a jerking motion.  911 was called. This seizure like activity lasted 4-6 seconds at which time pt. regained consciousness and immediately sat up.  Pt was pale and diaphoretic.  BP 98/64, HR 78, Pulse Ox 99%.  Pt vomited multiple times.  Ice was applied to the posterior neck and a cold compress to the forehead .  EMS arrived and took vitals: BP 78/40.  Pt. was aware of person, place and situation.  Pt. was taken to Hospital accompanied by her husband.  Pt was called by me Friday and she was home.  All tests showed no sign of having a seizure.

The nurse took my vitals and the doctor ordered covid test for me and a urine analysis. The covid test came back negative and my urine analysis was in the normal range. The nurse gave me Tynenol at  around 1 am and ibuprofen at around 2:30 am. I was discharged at approximately 5 am on April 10, 2021 with a 98.4 degree temperature.

Experienced chills and a fever (elevated to 103.5 degrees), elevated heart rate, headache, and muscle pain from 9:00pm - 4:00am Sunday, 4/11/2021 and could not sleep at all during that time. I took 1 extra-strength tylenol around 2:30am. Finally fell asleep around 4:30am on 4/11/2021 and when I woke up again at 7:30am on 4/11/2021, all side effects were gone. All side effects came on and then went away in about a 12 hour period.

                                                -Dibilitating headache came on slowly starting around 4pm day of vaccine (roughly 60-90 minutes following) Built in intensity and the following morning throughout the day after vaccine was causing dizziness to the point of motionsickness and vomiting when moved too much. headache hit peak at 24 hrs post vaccination and slowly decreased in intensity until about 48 hrs post vaccination. Took advil throughout. -Full body shivers despite warm or hot environment and comfort level Beginning about 30 hrs post vaccination vaccination and lasting about 6 hrs.  -Large bump at vaccination point started developing 72 hrs post vaccination. By 5 days post it was the diameter of roughly a baseball but only slightly raised, hot to the touch, very painful, restricted arm function and itched. That evening before bed (5 days post) self treated with 20 minute ice pack,  hydrocortizone cream and performing deep massage moving outward from vaccination point as long as could tolerate pain. Noticed extreme improvement the next morning: area had cooled to regular body temperature marked improvement in pain, size and fuctionality. Repeated &#34;treatment&#34; that evening (6 days post) and today (a few hours shy of 7 days post) area is still itchy, knot has decreased to the size of a bean, pain gone except when poked like a bruise. I will likely repeat self prescribed treatment more time.

                                                I had an extreme headache for at least three days following my vaccination.  The same night as the vaccination I had a fever and also sweat profusely.  I also had full body aches that I was unable to treat with  over the counter medication.

                                                The adverse symptoms I experienced were abnormally severe/heavy menstrual bleeding and abdominal pain. I was on Day 4 of my menstrual cycle on the day of my injection (April 3, 2021). My menstrual cycle usually starts to go away on Day 4 and concludes by Day 7. But the day after my injection, in addition to experiencing the common side effects of fever, chills, aches, and headaches, I also experienced an uptick in bleeding, which included severe/heavy menstrual bleeding with very frequent and large blood clots. That same day (April 4), I started my new birth control cycle as prescribed. By Day 8 (April 7, 2021), my menstrual bleeding continued to be so severe/heavy that I went to my OB-GYN for testing. The OB-GYN ruled out everything but the vaccine as an environmental factor. It was suggested that I take 600mg of Motrin every 6-hours for 48 hours. My menstrual bleeding continued for several more days until concluding on Day 12 (April 11, 2021) but I am still experiencing abdominal pain.

Woke up with severe chills / teeth chattering / uncontrollable shivering, my husband said my body was warm but I felt chilled to the bone.  Finally got warm enough to fall asleep around 2am.  The next day, more chills, headache, fatigue, and general malaise all day.  Started feeling better on the third day.  Today, tightness in right side of chest--not sure if related, will be calling the doctor.

For the rest of that day I felt that way it was not until I went to bed and got up the next morning that the dizziness was away. On that day when I woke up which was the day after my shot I was achy, tired(slept a lot) and still have the headache. As of today I still have all three symptoms but I would say not as severe.

Around 2:00 p.m. on 04/12/2021, i began to get bodyaches again as well as an accompanying migraine and was now experiencing some nausea and had begun to develop a yeast infection. On 04/13/2021, most symptoms had resolved outside of the continuing yeast infection. No symptoms were present on the morning of 04/14/2021, other than the yeast infection. The evening of 04/14/2021 i began to develop symptoms again in the form of a migraine, body aches, and nausea. The morning of 04/15/2021, i woke up with these same symptoms, but also had the chills again and was very fatigued.

Roughly 9 hours after shot developed joint pain/tickling/shaking chills in my legs (mostly in the thighs) and nausea. Temperature rose to 102 degrees over the next 3 hours (I usually run around 97.5) along with the above pain. Around midnight/1 am I was able to get the fever down using Tylenol and a cold bath and the sensation in my legs lessened.  The following day I was still a bit nauseous with a headache and low grade fever. The same leg sensation (but to a much lower degree) persisted for 2 days.

Laying down heart rate was between 115-120 I got my injection, a few minutes later my heart was fast, but I left anyway. My heart was fast through the day, but manageable. At night I fell asleep, and woke up 1.5 hours later to a heart rate of 123. I got up to use the bathroom and could barely breathe because it jumped to 140 while walking the 10 feet to the bathroom.  My heart stayed that fast until the morning

                                                Around 5:30 pm in the evening following my vaccine I started having chills, headache, nausea, and fever of 101. Chills got worse, whole body was shaking and shivering. Nausea progressed into constant dry heaving. Head was pounding with the worst pain I have ever felt in my life, worse than natural child birth and worse than running marathons. The nausea was so bad and I could feel my fever burning and getting worse. I was about to vomit so got out of bed to go to the toilet to vomit and the whole room started spinning completely out of control. My heart was racing and I could hear it and feel it pounding rapidly through my ears. I couldn?t walk and was so disoriented I crawled to the bathroom to throw up in the toilet. My husband heard me and came and picked me up off the bathroom floor and carried me to our bed. As the night progressed fever got worse, head was in almost unbearable pain, severe body aches over my whole body, heart racing and horrible nausea and dry heaving.  I made it through the night. For two days after I had a headache and fever  and nausea and body aches and couldn?t get out of bed to care for my children. By the third and fourth day I was able to get out of bed at times and still felt fatigue, nausea, headache and body aches. Anytime I would stand up for 10 days after the vaccine it felt like I was rocking on a boat. I am almost at 2 weeks and still feel fatigue and dizziness at times. On April 15th, 9 days after my vaccination I had symptoms of a blood clot in my leg. I went to the Emergency Room and was diagnosed with a superficial blood clot of the leg as well as swelling in the vein. I am thankful to be alive!

                                                When I got the shot, moderately severe pain immediately radiated down my arm and into my last two fingers on my left arm as well as up into my shoulder blade area. It was a lot more painful than I expected based on previous shots. I went to bed with only arm pain and a small headache. Around 11pm that night I woke up in severe pain that was much worse than my chronic pain. I have prescription narcotic pain medication and that did not help. I was unable to leave bed and called my doctor at his home around 7am. I had a very bad headache (and I am used to headaches) and all of the areas of my body that normally hurt hurt much worse. My fingertips started tingling. I was miserable and in bed for about 3 days before starting to feel better, at which point I noticed that my arms and hands were off. The last two fingers on my left hand lost grip strength for about a week. The muscles In my arms kept getting weak. My fingers and the palms of my hands continue to tingling uncomfortably but the weakness is improving.

                                                Severe headache that lasted several days, extremely heavy period. Soaking overnight pads every fifteen - twenty minutes for three days while still leaking and dripping blood everywhere. Extreme cramps that I would rate at a 10/10 in pain. Absolutely debilitating.  Day four has been soaking overnight pads at a slower rate but still less than an hour per pad. Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Unable to keep food down but able to keep water down. No fever.

I was still able to breathe and noticed that this was not normal. I pressumed my day as usual. On Thursday I went to my local urgent care. They performed an EKG, Blood test to rule out infection and blood clots and a chest x ray. All of my test came back NORMAL. My Dr. stated that it was &#34; CHEST WALL MUSCLE PAIN&#34; The CHEST TIGHTNESS WENT AWAY ON SUNDAY. 1 week later from the day of the injection.

                                                About 24-36 hours after receiving the vaccine I experienced pain/burning on my labia (the outside, not inside). After inspecting it myself I realized I had multiple lesions 2 days post vax. I saw a nurse practitioner and I went on anti virals prescribed by a local woman?s clinic for suspected herpes which cleared things up within the 10 day regimen. They immediately did a swab of the area for suspected herpes simplex which was negative. I have since done 4&#43; herpes simplex 1 and 2 tests (blood and swab) and all have been negative. I have also done HIV, RPR, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and auto immune blood tests (and more) and all results have been negative. The issue is now cleared but my PCP wanted to find the root cause of the issue and potential underlying condition.   I have a history of shingles on my back/shoulder and the pain/lesions appeared similar in nature but presented on both sides of my labia in this situation (though much more on one side than the other). My last major outbreak on my back/shoulder was in 2010-2011. This was the only outbreak in which lesions appeared though I sometimes feel the area tingle/tense up when under stress or sick.   In addition to the lesions, I had typical flu like symptoms after the vaccine that began about 8 hours after and lasted for 2-3 days.

                                                Mild headache and nausea set in shortly after the injection on Friday, but went away after rest and eating/drinking. My arm was sore for the entire evening. I woke up around 2am Saturday morning and became dizzy. I fell to the floor and passed out for a short period of time. When I woke, I was extremely nauseous to the point of nearly vomiting. I had chills and fever. I could hardly move due to weakness - I needed help getting back into bed. When I woke the next morning, I had 100.3 fever, I had a headache and my entire body was sore. My fever went away late Saturday afternoon, but I still felt mildly nauseous. It is Monday and I still have mild nausea and light-headedness. My arm is only slightly sore.

I woke up at 12:25a.m (Sunday March 7th, 2021) with a fever of 104.3 and was experiencing extreme neck and head pain. My hands hurt as if I had arthritis and couldn&#39;t make them feel better. I was very short of breath and dry coughing. I took Tylenol and tried to lay back down and was able to go back to sleep around 3:00a.m. I got up at 6:10am and my temp was 101.6. I took Ibuprofen at this point and by 9:30am my temp was 99.8. I was still experiencing a very bad headache and my neck and back were achy. I felt a lot better by about 11:00am, took a hot shower and laid down for a nap around 2:00pm Sunday. When I woke up around 3:15p.m I had spiked yet another fever of 102.0 and was having bad body aches again in my neck and head area and it continued to get worse though my back over the next hour. I was experiencing a dry cough again also but this time it was more constant. It took over 3 hours for my fever to go below 100.0 with alternating Tylenol and Ibuprofen. It finally broke around 7:00p.m. I had a lot of pain in my neck and head the rest of the night. I woke up Monday March 8th, 2021 with a moderate headache but it went away throughout the day. No fever returned Monday. The only time I experienced coughing and shortness of breath was while I had the fever.

                                                I am currently pregnant. This is my first pregnancy.  My due date is August 29, 2021.  My pregnancy has thus far been really easy with no complications.  I had a low grade fever that I took Tylenol to treat.  I had pretty bad muscle and joint pain, chills, and could not stop shaking.  I just felt freezing.  Once my fever broke I felt extremely hot all night.  The next morning I was exhausted and had a lot of the muscle and joint pain still.  I marked on my report that it would&#39;ve stopped me from going about my normal daily activities, as I could not have gone to work and spent most of the day resting.  For the next few days I was tired and my eyes ached.  On Monday and Tuesday I had a headache in the afternoon.  Yesterday afternoon my eyes finally stopped aching and everything seems to be back to normal.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At 7:00am on 3/11/2021 felt light headed as  waking up along obvious soreness on the arm where I received the vaccine- left arm.  Then later around 10:00am a feeling of tiredness came over my whole body.  Around 12:00pm I felt even more tired, lightheaded  and my eyeballs felt as if with high pressure in them and are feel sensitive to the sunlight.  Also, at 12pm, I had lunch, which was my first meal of this day and felt the necessity to lay in bed and take a nap for 20 minutes before returning to work.  While taking the nap I felt tingling on my feet, arms, hands and neck along with certain sudden muscle contractions on the same parts.

When I woke up around 7 am, I was exhausted for the rest of the day. I had a bad headache all day. I had a 100-degree fever that broke during the early afternoon. On the following two days, I had a mild headache that lasted through the afternoon. It felt like someone was pulling the muscle behind my right eyebrow.

                                                Developed a fever of 104F at 14 hours after injection.  After taking acetaminophen, the fever dropped to around 101 and stayed there for 12 hours before subsiding.  Body aches and extreme fatigue were also present.  48 hours after injection (03/08/2021) I woke up with major skin irritation.  There were no visible signs like a rash or any redness, but my skin felt sunburned and wearing clothes was extremely uncomfortable.  This lasted until 03/10/2021.  I used lotions and took cool showers to help with the symptoms.

Additional symptoms: chills and headache. Chills were mild. Headache felt like an 8/10, pain irradiated throughout my entire head. I took a total of 1500mg of acetaminophen and tried to go back to sleep. I awoke at around 11:30 am, and I have had a mild headache since then; I have not taken any more medication. I have been drinking water and eating soup. Chills have been random and sporadic throughout the day. I tried to log into the v-safe app, but it would not let me submit today&#39;s report. I will try again, and if I have any other symptoms and can&#39;t submit them through the app, then I will report them here. Thank you everyone for your hard work!

                                                About 6 hours after vaccination on 3/8, flu-like symptoms: chills, weakness, fatigue, headache. That lasted into the following ~1.5 days and was relieved with Tylenol and bed rest. Mild nausea on 3/9-3/10. The most concerning possible adverse event started on the evening of 3/12. I noticed my achilles area was itchy after taking a shower that night. I woke up the following morning on 3/13 VERY itchy on my left arm and ankles. I started to break out in hives on my lower legs and bilateral arms into the afternoon. I took Benadryl as directed on the package to try and relieve the hives. In the evening on 3/13 I tried taking a lukewarm bath with 1/2 cup of baking soda and epsom salt. After soaking for about 30 minutes, the hives had worsened and about 65% of my body was covered in hives. I called my primary care&#39;s emergency line that night and was prescribed 40mg Pepcid x 7 days and a Methylprednisolone pack to take in addition to the Benadryl. I took the 40mg Pepcid along with Benadryl and was able to relieve most of the hives. I did not take the methylprednisolone at all. I did wake up in the middle of the night with a scratchy throat and took another Benadryl to relieve that. The following morning on 3/14 I woke up and had some hives on my hands that disappeared that early afternoon without having to take Benadryl. In the evening on 3/14 at around 6pm the hives started to reappear on bilateral arms as well as legs. I took the 40mg Pepcid as well as Benadryl and the hives did not completely disappear before bed. The following morning on 3/15 it appears that the hives had disappeared. They did not reappear the following evening but I still took the 40mg Pepcid the evening of 3/15. Today is 3/16 and I have continued to be hive-free. One other detail to note, on 3/15 at around 4 in the afternoon I took an old supplement - Cranberry with Vitamin C. So I am not sure if this reaction was related to the expired supplement, the vaccine, or both.

On March 11 I broke out in hives on both arms, both thighs, neck/clavicle, and lower right leg this started around 8am. After work I went to Pharmacy to their consultation window (2:15) and they recommended benadryl and to call my PCP. I took my first dose at 2:30pm and followed up with a second one around 9pm. I called and  spoke with my PCP over the phone, she had me take benadryl at night for the next 3 days and claritin in the morning for the next 3 days.  The hives and redness were gone by the morning of the  12th. My skin was still sensitive throughout the 12th but was back to normal by the time I went to bed on the 12 (10pm ish)

                                                I received the vaccine at 36 weeks pregnant. I am estimated to deliver April 16th.  About 8 hours after receiving the vaccine I noticed general bodily discomfort and achiness, as well as a loss of appetite and a headache. About 30 minutes after that I developed chills but no fever, and was fatigued enough to fall asleep an hour before my usual bedtime. I slept terribly in the night due to the achiness and pain at the injection site making it hard to lay on my side, which I have to do for pregnancy. I went to bed with chills but woke up sweating and discovered a fever of 100.2 around 12:45 AM. By 5:30 my temperature was down to 98. The following morning I continue to experience achiness, fatigue, decreased appetite, and a headache. I seem to have felt some pelvic cramping associated with pregnancy but it may be unrelated.

                                                After being administered the vaccine at 7:12 am, when the nurse stood me up and started to walk me to the holding area, I became dizzy, my legs got weak, and there was a loud ringing in my ears. I nearly collapsed as I reached the seat in the holding area they were taking me to. I placed one 0.5MG tablet of my prescription Alprazolam in my mouth and waited for the nurse to bring water. They took me via wheelchair from the holding area to a secluded spot behind a curtain. There, I laid on a cot, received cold water, and a nurse talked to me while I recovered. It felt like I was having an anxiety attack, which has never happened to me after getting a shot before. Fitbit heart rate data shows my heart rate at 105 BPM at 7:00 am (going through the admission process, walking around the facility), 83 BPM at 7:10 am, 79 BPM at 7:15 am, 74 BPM at 7:20 am. Between 8:15 am and 1:25 pm, my heart rate remained between 63 and 89 BPM. My arm was sore and my skin hurt (an issue that I have when I feel very stressed). Additional symptoms arose around 1:35 pm. I began going through cycles of chills, sweating and overheating. My heart rate ranged from 127 BPM and 93 BPM for the remainder of the night. I took Tylenol at 7:07 PM to help with my fever.

                                                I received the Janssen (J&amp;J) vaccine at 11:12pm on 3/5/2021. I went to bed with a slightly sore arm. I woke up the following day 3/6/2021 with a slight headache and feeling a little achy. At around 11:00-12:00pm on 3/6/2021 I started having a fever, chills, aches, an increasingly bad headache. For the next 18 hours I had a fever, shaking, aches, bad migraine headache, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. I felt increasingly sick and my lowest point was at around 9:00pm on 3/6/2021 when I vomited. Around 5:00-6:00am on 3/7/2021 I felt considerably better and no longer had a fever. I was exhausted and still had a headache. I was very fatigued for the next two weeks.   I was menstruating when I received the vaccine. My menstruation stopped when I was having side effects for about 2-3 days and then started again.  In addition, I have psoriasis and on 3/7/2021 my skin looked noticeably better than it had looked before I received the vaccine. The psoriasis I had on my hands almost completely disappeared. A few days later, my psoriasis looked worse than I had looked before I received the vaccine. Today 3/29/2021, my psoriasis is back to how it looked right before I received the vaccination.

By Monday, the migraine, sweating, muscle weakness,  and nausea reduced, dizziness and fever stopped. Could slowly start to get up. It took until Friday for the rest to stop and return to normal.

Had a sore arm for a couple hours right after vaccination which did go away and didn&#39;t return. Around 3:15 pm the same day, I started to feel rundown - fatigued and slight elevated temperature. Around 2 hours later, I started feeling feverish and my temperature was around 99 degrees F. I took a tylenol which helped bring my temperature down temporarily, but around 9 pm it was a lot worse and I was feeling chills as well. I took my temperature and it was 102 degrees F. I took more tylenol and this helped bring my temperature down again. I went to bed and started feeling chills again around 3 am so I took another tylenol and when I woke up again around 8 am, I did not feel feverish anymore, but had a headache and still felt rundown and fatigued. On 4/2 (day after vaccine), I started feeling better as the day went on and fever did not return.

Pedialyte and topical CBD may also have lessened body aches.

                                                I felt the vaccination spreading through my body as I got really heavy and lost consciousness. I woke up to my husband holding my head and yelling my name. I had been seizing and had bitten my tongue. I was very white and nauseous and cold and shaky. They gave me water and a cold pack. The seizure probably only lasted for 5 seconds but it&#39;s hard to say. I felt very fatigued afterwards. I stayed for 10 more min and drank water and then they sent me on my way.

I wasn&#39;t able to get up and my arm swelled up really bad.  I was having streak in my vison and really bad dey eyes and mouth.  I had a fever on going for about 3 weeks straight. I called my Doctor the following day and she said it was a normal reaction, if it get&#39;s worse to call her again. I called her again because it got worse, my neck got swollen. left arm was trembling, lymph nodes were swollen, leg leg was pulsating. I started having chills and hot flashes ( I still have some till this day). My Doctor recommended seeing a specialist- Neurologist, Infectious Disease Dr.  The Neurologist said he can see where I get the trembles but does not  want to put me on medication and see if it goes away on it&#39;s own. I have a follow up with him regarding trembles, headache, flashing in my eyes. The Infectious Disease Dr. I&#39;m following up her her again regarding my arm swelling, they prescribed me steroids but had not gone down.  Since all of this I have been very fatigue, this is everyday.

The feeling continued to get stronger and I began sweating and feeling nauseous. I felt like I was going to throw up and/ or pass out. I was about to go get someone and let them know, but then it started easing back off again. It came and went all within about five minutes. I hung around the site a little longer than instructed to be safe, but felt fine and left. Two hours later, I&#39;ve had no other symptoms besides soreness in my arm and a slight headache.

                                                Within about 30 mins of the shot I became extremely lethargic. Hard to keep my eyes open. The injection site was extremely hot to touch and very sore. While the rest of my body was of normal temperature. Shortly after, I?d say about 45 minutes after injection, came the cold chills. I was freezing cold and shaking  fallowed by a fever. I became very foggy. It was hard to keep a conversation and had extreme waves of nausea. My mouth would salivate like the vomit was coming. I never actually vomited. But that continued  for the next 36 hours. I had to call out of work yesterday. Starting 24hrs after injection. I could not get out of bed. My body was very weak. Aches everywhere, I was freezing cold shaking with chills yet waking up in my bed covered in sweat. I was extremely restless and kept waking up to put a cold towel on my head to try to break my fever. At this point my headache was so severe. Any movement felt like my head would explode.  It?s now 48 hours after the injection my head is still pounding and my body still full of aches. Left arm is still really sore. I truly regret taking the vaccine. And would recommend others to not take it until further testing goes into this product.

                                                Re: Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Received vaccine at about 10:21am. Developed possible adverse effects at about 4:00pm. Initially I noticed weakness and feeling &#34;out of it&#34;. I was grocery-shopping at the time, and pushing the cart, standing upright, etc. was becoming difficult. Sometime between 4:00pm and 5:00pm I became delirious and also was no longer able to stand or sit upright. In my altered state I believed that my muscles, especially those in my legs, were turning into goo and then turning into normal muscles again. I experienced fever dreams. I had hot flashes and chills. I had the worst pain that I have experienced in recent memory.  I think that I may have had a migraine episode in addition to, and triggered by, these experiences. I had nausea (no vomiting).  Most of these events lasted until about between 12:30am to 1:00am, which was when I fell asleep. When I woke up the following morning (today as I am reporting), I still had a mild headache and exhaustion but the other events had resolved.

                                                Within about 12 hours of getting the vaccine, I started having chills, fever and severe body aches. I took extra strength Tylonol and those symptoms subsided within about 48 hours. The symptom that worries me is the tingling in both my arms that seems to get worse when I lay down. Each night since I received the vaccine, my arms have gone completely numb in the middle of the night. Once I move them repeatedly for about 5-10 min, the numbness goes away. Before the numbness starts, my arms usually begin to tingle.

                                                A few minutes after receiving the vaccine, while I was in the 15 minute observation period, I began to feel hot and cold at the same time, began sweating heavily, my limbs started becoming very weak and I started seeing spots. I called over a doctor and explained what was happening. He got a wheelchair and brought me to a room to lie down. During this time, my vision continued to get worse (seeing more spots and less peripheral vision).  Upon laying down, the doctor put my feet up and a nurse took my blood pressure. If I remember correctly, it was 90/58. My normal blood pressure is around 112/68. A nurse also put ice under my neck. Immediately upon laying down, I started feeling better. I was observed for a while more and then a nurse took my blood pressure again (both laying down and sitting up). My limbs still felt weak when seated and my blood pressure was better but not normal yet, so I was told to lay down a bit longer. Then, a nurse checked my blood pressure again (laying down, sitting up and standing up). It was back to normal and I was feeling better. I was cleared to leave the vaccine clinic. Since leaving the clinic, I haven&#39;t had any abnormal side effects or reactions.

Shortness of breath started the next day on Sunday , extreme, far beyond normal asthma or any asthma attack. Went to urgent care on Tuesday- they said it was likely a side effect of j &amp;J and tested me for COVID, kidney disease other things, all came back negtative. Apparently I wasn?t the first person they had seen with shortness of breath. Blood in cough and spit on Wednesday after 2.5 days of  shortness of breath. Dizziness (extreme) throughout and chest pain, sternum hurt, chest tightness. Went to Er. They ran a lot of tests and they too said they had seen others with shortness of breath from j and j. They ruled out many things like pneumonia, a birth control blood clot, any lung diseases with X-rays and blood tests. I was given torkeril to ease the chest pain and tightness which it did. Blood stopped coming up in tissues. Doctor said likely inflammatory reaction to the vaccine in lungs, (I have a piece of paper proving that) and cartilage and sternum., which hurt extremely when he touched it. Blood was likely from burst capillaries from overcompensation from trying to breathe. Recommended I return if more blood came up, which it hasn?t.  Shortness of breath has not subsided. I can?t even hold a phone app without being winded. So email back, don?t call.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I began by feeling stiffness and soreness in my joints and muscles, particularly my back and lower body.  The pain and stiffness worsened, and I began to feel ill similar to a common cold. Approximately 12-18 hours after receiving the vaccine, my symptoms worsened so much that I could hardly stand or move around, and began throwing up. This continued and worsened as my entire body felt pain and stiffness, I felt very weak and fatigued, and I was throwing up violently with frequency. I threw up so much and with enough force that I started to see bright red blood in my spittle and vomit. I had a severe headache accompanying these other symptoms.  I also had problems with homeostatic temperature regulation  and was simultaneously sweating profusely and very warm to the touch while feeling like I was cold.  I was shaky and experienced tremors and twitches in my hands, arms, legs, and feet. I kept throwing up and experiencing these symptoms for approximately 72 hours after recieving my vaccine.  I was virtually incapacitated for those three days of severe illness-like symptoms.

                                                The following day after my vaccination, I had a severe headache all over the top of my head and eventually only the left side of my head and face felt intense pain. It felt kind of like a stabbing or shooting pain down into my head. Then I started feeling a lot if pressure and pain in my left eye, eye brow, and the sinus area. I could hardly open my eyes. My left side of my face also tingled with tiny sharp pains or numbness. This pain intensified for about 5 days so I started taking aspirin. It would feel slightly better but then would feel even worse.  I decided to use a netti pot to remove pressure. After about 5 days of using that I started to feel better. I would say I started to feel back to normal two weeks after the shot.

I also had numb fingertips which lasted for around 20 minutes right after the chills really set in. I&#39;m not positive its related but two nights after my vaccine injection, I woke up at night because my feet were itching and hot. They also had the pins and needles sensation and these symptoms lasted around 20 to 30 minutes. I have never had that happen before so I assume it was vaccine related.

                                                Fifteen minutes after leaving  I was experiencing dizziness. During the night while trying to fall asleep I was hallucinating like someone was in my room but no one was there. The next day I felt like I had the flu, and just arm pain. Following days I felt tired and had a headache on the top of my head ranging from a seven to a ten in pain. I tried Tylenol but no help because body rejected it. I tried Excedrin migraine for headaches but still no let up. I am still experiencing headaches and Fatigue.

For the next week the chest pain persist and got worse. I experienced severe chest pains, struggled with breathing at night, was extremely tired and felt worn out.  I had sharp pains throughtout my body so I went to the ER where a EKG and D-Dimer test was perfomed and was advised it was elevated and I left.  I went to the ER later that day who checked the D-Dimer who advised it was normal and was I  was released from there as well after monitoring.  The next day I began having sharp pains in my stomach and diarreah which prompted me to now go to hospital where a CT scan, X-Ray and EKG was perfomed there also which all results came back normal and advised I reach out to a Cardiovascular Specialist for the Chest pains and I have an appointment scheduled for 4/21/21 for further followup on that

                                                On March 6, 2021, I received the Johnson and Johnson Vaccination at about 8:15 am.  Around 7:00 pm that evening I started to experience the normal symptoms that they had advertised. Yes, I felt like I COVID again for about 48 hours, but nothing alarming.   On March 12, 2021, I went to an appointment with doctor due to extreme abdominal cramping and very heavy period.  This is not totally out of the norm due to my infertility, but I felt like something was off. I had random abdominal bruising and ruptured cyst pain; which I am still experiencing. She ordered an ultrasound to rule out a mass in my uterus due to the extreme pain and bruising.   On March 22, 2021, I woke up at 3:00 am with extreme stomach pain and extreme diarrhea.  As the morning went on I began to feel worse and worse. Other symptoms I experienced were; severe headache, shortness of breath, heartburn (I felt like I was having a heart attack), nausea, back pain, and extremely tired.  At 6:30 am  took me to the ER due to my worsening symptoms. Everything checked out fine and they thought I could have an ulcer, but I wanted to make you aware of these symptoms that I experienced.   I still have days that I experience some of these symptoms, but they have been under control and monitored closely.

                                                6 hours after I got the vaccine I started getting a headache, followed quickly by horrible body chills and then horrible body aches. My temperature about an hour later was 105. I took 1000 mg of Tylenol right away and put a cold rag on my head and tried to go to sleep. A couple hours later my fever started breaking, when it was 102.7 I was a sweaty mess and extremely hot and puked a lot.  My fever and other symptoms went away within about 7 hours after my fever started breaking.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Mid Saturday night I woke up to chills and was shaking so bad I couldn&#39;t fall back asleep even after adding another layer of clothes and blanket. Sunday morning I was still very cold and tired from not sleeping. I developed body aches but they were everywhere not just my arm. I was very fatigued and didn&#39;t have an appetite. The worst part was getting a migraine with extreme light sensitivity. I couldn&#39;t stand to be around any windows without blinds. I spent the day in my bedroom sleeping with the curtains closed and an eye mask on. By that night, the migraine had subsided but I was adding hot flashes to the problem list. Had a pretty restless night again on Sunday. Woke up Monday to the light sensitivity back but not as severe. I took the day off work because I couldn&#39;t handle looking at a computer screen all day. By about 1pm I was feeling mostly back to normal. My arm is still sore near the injection site and I&#39;m a bit fatigued at times but those are the only things remaining.

                                                I?ve never had an allergic reaction to anything before.  Received the vaccine at around 9:55am on 03/08/21.  Pain while the vaccine was being administered but it healed within a few minutes. I started getting a mild headache at around 3:30pm while at work. When I got home at around 6pm I started having severe chills, the headache became intense, my mouth and eyelids felt hot, my hands and feet felt very cold and when I checked temperature it was 102.4.  By 9:00 pm the headache became excruciating like I?ve never had it before, as if my head was being squeezed or pressed. Eyes and the back of my jaw hurt too.  Had light and sound sensitivity. Took 200mg of Advil but pain was still almost intolerable until I was finally able to fall asleep at around 4:00 am.  Was still in pain the day after but not as bad as the night before. Only mild pain today but started feeling itchy tonight and noticed some rashes on my body.

I started to develop a low grade fever 8 hours after the shot. 13 hours after the shot, I had a 104.1 fever. Along with the fever, I experienced severe body aches and chills, nausea and a horrible headache. I couldn?t walk as my body was so weak and my vision was blurry. About 15 hours after the vaccine, my fever went down to 102. I was able to get up and walk to my kitchen to take some Advil. My fever broke 20 hours after the vaccine with the medicine. I?m still experiencing severe body aches, headache, nausea and chills and it has been about 30 hours after vaccine. I did have covid 3 months ago, and the symptoms from the vaccine were much worse than the symptoms I had with actual covid.

                                                Felt fantastic until 7 hours after the shot at 5pm on 3/13/21. Then body aches began followed by fever (100.7 taken by ear) and then headache. Headache and body aches became intense by 6:20pm on the day I received the vaccine. I took Tylenol Extra strength which helped the body aches and lowered the fever a bit but did little for the headache. Chills started around 10pm accompanied by vomiting and severe diarrhea at 1am. Blood pressure spiked at 142/101 shortly after third vomiting episode. Called family to take me to ER but didn?t end up going because I was able to get vomiting and blood pressure under control by 3am. Figured doctors would just hook me up to an IV of fluids and send me on my way anyway, not something I can afford. No more fever or chills since 4am on 3/14/21. Headache and diarrhea and slight nausea still persisting 29 hours after the shot. Treating symptoms with Tylenol, water, pedialyte, chicken broth, and toast diet. Unable to care for my children, worst I?ve felt in years. Regularly get the flu shot with no side effects.

Chills lasted for hours and couldn&#39;t stop shaking, so took Tylenol at 12:15am. Around 1:00am the chills subsided. Around 2:00am fever burnt off, sweating and hot. Couldn&#39;t sleep the rest of the night. Slept from 8am-10am and woke with just headache. Took Tylenol around 10:30am to help with headache and it did start to subside. Was mostly fatigued and muscle aches the rest of the day until 6pm when I started to get cold again. Feels like the fever and chills are coming back and it&#39;s currently 7:30pm, so assuming it&#39;ll be another night of this.

                                                3/6/21  This is a 32-year-old female who is receiving her first Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine and shortly afterwards developed some throat itching and tightness.  She was given a milligram of epinephrine by intramuscular injection by retired emergency physician there and then transported by ambulance here for further evaluation.  Says her tongue felt a little swollen as well but she denies any respiratory symptoms.  Her voice sounds crackly to her.  She denies any pruritus or rashes.  She has had multiple allergic reactions to medications in the past but never having to be admitted overnight.  One episode however did occur while she was hospitalized and receiving treatment.  She has never had to be intubated.  She has had isolated urticaria without oral or throat symptoms and vice versa.  At this point she says she does feel somewhat better. She is given IV dexamethasone and observed here.  At 1 point she complained of it complaint complained of it feeling like a tightening in the back of her throat was worsening.  She is given an additional intramuscular dose of epinephrine with epinephrine and on reexamination had no significant change in physical findings or her phonation.  This occurred again and she was given viscous lidocaine with minimal improvement in her symptoms.  After several hours of observation without objective worsening but continued complaint of feeling increasing tightness in her throat, CT imaging of the neck is performed to assess the soft tissue structures.  No abnormalities or indication of significant retropharyngeal or paralaryngeal edema or airway compromise present. Given the possibility of some laryngeal muscle or parapharyngeal muscle spasm as him, she was given Flexeril.  After some discussion with her I did indicate to her that I felt it would be safe to return home but offered admission for observation as well.  She indicated she was comfortable returning home for continued observation.  She will be continued on steroids and antihistamines and is given additional Flexeril by prescription if this does seem to help her symptoms.  If no improvement over the next 2 to 3 days and follow-up either with her primary providers through facility or Dr.  3/7/21: Return to ED. The patient is in no respiratory distress.  She has no wheezing.  On physical exam her throat lips and tongue look fine.  I think she is not a had another allergic reaction, rebounded from yesterday.  She is not on any type of steroids sinus syndrome with some Decadron.  And she is allergic to Benadryl but she can take Claritin if she wants.  Her CBC and chemistry were normal.  I went back to evaluate her and she still getting fluids and now she is complaining of shooting pain down her left leg from the EpiPen.  Again she has this regional complex pain syndrome that could be part of that but there is nothing I can do for this at this time.  In terms of her allergic reaction she feels much better her throat feels normal.  We will send her out with prescription for Decadron and EpiPen and if she gets worse she will come back and will follow up admit her.

Today Wednesday March the 17 I have been feeling much better.

The highest fever I ever recorded was 100.6 but it felt much higher. I had nausea, body aches, headache, and exhaustion for a full 24 hours. Within 48 hours, my chills and aches were mostly gone, but a sore throat, cough, and congestion developed. As of this morning, Friday 19 March, I?m still exhausted, but  all other symptoms have finally resided.

Around 12:30AM I felt feverish, and body aches, severe headache and chills that woke me up. Took Tylenol. Felt like I had the flu. Next day kept treating with Tylenol as needed and the fatigue, body aches and low energy persisted along with headache but by night time I was feeling somewhat  better. Next day I was much better that I could work from home. Still felt a little fatigued other symptoms subsided.

                                                Currently pregnant due May 31. I got the vaccine at 4 pm on Wednesday. At around 6pm I started to get a headache, I took 2 tylenol but it continued to get progressively worse. By 7 I was starting to get really fatigued and fell asleep. I woke up around 8 or 9 still fatigued with body aches and a headache. The body aches and headache continued to worsen, but due to pregnancy I could not take any more tylenol. Around midnight I got out of bed to use the bathroom and immediately started violently shivering. It continued for a few minutes after I got back into bed, it did cause a lot of pain in my joints and muscles. A few hours later I woke up very hot and sweaty. The next day (Thursday) I continued to feel very fatigued with body aches and a headache to the point where I had to stop working even though I work from home. The following day (Friday) I was still mildly fatigued and had some body aches, and my brain felt very foggy so I took off work again. I regularly checked my temperature during this time and did not have a fever.

                                                I was fine from 10am until 3:30pm on the day of injection. I started to feel feverish and chills at 3:30 and it progressed into a 99.2 fever with all over body aches and a headache and chills. I took alkasletzer cold medicine with Tylenol in it to help with the fever. It got the symptoms down where I could move and stood in the hot shower for 30 minutes to help warm me up. I felt slightly better and still had fever symptoms and severe body aches. I started feeling unable to move due to the fever symptoms again around 9pm and took 2 extra strength Tylenol that eventually worked and I had some nausea with that. I hadn?t been able to eat because of the symptoms and the nausea could have been from taking meds on an empty stomach. I finally felt able to eat around 10pm and had some food and went to bed. I could barley sleep all night and was tossing and turning due to fever. My nose started to get runny around 10pm before I went to bed. I woke up the next day and still had the fever symptoms, body aches and the worst headache I have ever had, a 10 on the pain scale. I took another 2 extra strength Tylenol and went to sleep for 2 hours. I woke up and could tell the fever had broken and my head was still in pretty severe pain- about a 7 on the pain scale.  I was incredibly fatigued the entire day and felt hot and cold throughout the day. I was incredibly weak and needed a lot of rest. I still didn?t sleep well through the night and woke up friday feeling fatigued. I expended some energy in the am at the dog park and had to sleep for 3 hours during the day which is atypical for me. I woke up Saturday morning (today) still feeling a headache and exhaustion. I will see how the rest of the day goes and am hoping to feel better and don?t know when the symptoms will stop.

Swelling did not respond to Benadryl. No other allergy symptoms (hives elsewhere, etc.) - Filing this report on Day 16 after vaccine and, while swelling has improved, itching persists and I still have a walnut-sized mass of firm tissue under skin near injection site and patch of redness/discoloration on deltoid. Have been checked by doctor who ensured that reaction is indeed dermatological allergic reaction (not infection).

                                                Most websites said 1-2 days for side effects to kick in but I was rocked pretty hard within the first 12 hours. The biggest symptoms I had were severe body aches, debilitating chills, fluctuating fever, headache, and no appetite.  4/1/21: * 11:15am: Vaccine administered * 12pm-6pm: Arm soreness, feeling cold/experiencing some chills, minor headache and stomach ache (I felt a little off but couldn?t tell if it was real or in my head) * 5:30pm: I walk home from work, which takes about about 35 minutes. Regret the decision about 10 mins from home due to onset body aches and fatigue  * 6pm: I go straight to bed freezing with crippling chills, body aches, and a headache * 8pm: Extreme nausea kicks in, I take Advil and cannot stomach more than one bite of food; still experiencing chills and body pain * 9pm: 100.7 fever, the chills subside and I start to get hot * 10:15pm: I finally eat some food, drink more water, body still aches, start to get chilly again  * 10:45pm: My fever is down to 99.3, my ears really hurt, like, ear-infection-style pain  * 11:15pm: 12ish hours post-vaccine, I have severe body aches, I alternate between really hot and cold, take more Advil and go to bed (finally fall asleep at midnight)  4/2/21: * 6:15am: Wake up; I spent the night tossing and turning with extreme night sweats. At this point I still have a pretty bad headache and painful body aches, specifically in my lower back and legs; fall back asleep * 8am-9am: Wake up and take more Advil. My whole body hurts. Toss and turn for a bit more. Small fever?99 degree temperature. Make coffee but have absolutely no appetite. * 9am-10am: So sweaty, fever is fully breaking * 11am: No more fever, slight headache, and body aches seem to be subsiding * 11:45am: Almost exactly 24 hours later and feeling good, comparatively speaking. Finally eat a bagel * 5:30pm: After lunch, I took a nap. My body aches have completely subsided, no fever. I still have a small headache and my ears still ache. But overall, I feel pretty normal! Just a little tired but probably from lack of sleep last night.

I had her sit down and told her I was giving her an Epinephrine 0.3mg shot.  The shot was given in her left thigh and within a minute her throat cleared. I gave her a bottle of water. She said her heart was racing but it eventually slowed down.  I asked her if she wanted me to call 911, she felt it was not necessary.  Patient sat in our waiting room &amp;  checked in on her every few minutes, her symptoms improved.  Patient was here over 45 minutes.  She wanted to go &amp; felt fine.  I told her to call us or go to the emergency room if any problems arise.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Woke up day after vaccine severely fatigued and exhausted. Ibuprofen helped minimally. Progression of the day symptoms got worse. By 2pm I had to leave work and go home. By this point my whole body was sore and felt like I had severe sunburn. By 7pm I had a low grade fever. Ibuprofen taken again allowed me to get to sleep. I sleep for nearly 15 hours.

Vomiting and Nausea subsided after 20 hours (25 hours after injection). Fever, chills, strong body aches (especially in legs) and headache lasted another 24 hours. It is now 72 hours post injections. Only remaining symptom is mild soreness at injection side but digestive system is still trying to recover from the intense vomiting that lasts 20 hours. I probably should have gone to the hospital but I don&#39;t have insurance so I tried to wait it out because I can&#39;t afford the bill and luckily I seem to be ok now.

                                                Patient arrived at pharmacy to receive her vaccine.  Patient seemed nervous.  Pharmacist asked if she has any questions and whether she&#39;s eaten or drank anything today.  Patient states that she&#39;s had a little something.  Pharmacist engaged patient in conversation during vaccination.  Patient was able to raise her arm and walk to waiting area after vaccination to wait her required 15 minutes waiting time.  After around 5 minutes, pharmacist went to check on patients at the waiting area, and patient got up and mentioned that she&#39;s not feeling too well.  In the next second, she had fainted on the floor.  Associates in the store called 911 while pharmacist and pharmacy tech stayed beside the patient to monitor breathing and heart rate.  Pulse was faint but breathing was steady.  Patient was completely unconscious for a good 3-5 minutes, but she started opening her eyes when EMS arrived.  After EMS took over, patient was able to sit up with assistance, talk, and respond.  Patient was taken out of the store on a stretcher.  EMS recorded that patient&#39;s BP was 132/82.

Symptoms started about 7.5 hrs after injection, mild at first but quickly became severe. When I felt well enough the next morning to try to take another pain/fever reducer, I did with no vomiting and was able to eat a small breakfast, and now it is about 27 hrs after injection and I feel almost 100% again. :)

                                                Roughly 10 hours after injection, moderate muscular pain at injection site, and severe pain in old lower back injury - chronic bulging disc. Back pain onset was severe enough to wake me up from sleep and persisted despite use of OTC pain management. Used 2x extra-strength 500mg acetaminophen, only dulled pain, then 600mg ibuprofen approximately 8 hours later to same result. As of 27 hours post injection, pain is still moderate and disruptive. Lack of sleep and pain make it hard to determine if the fatigue is a unique symptom or purely the result of the pain symptoms. In a non-measurable manner, having had this back injury for over 10 years with multiple reoccurrences, it feels like the joint/disk swelled enough for it to press on the spinal nerves despite attempts to mitigate with ice, elevating feet and head to open intervertebral space.

                                                Immediately after injection at 10:20am, I felt hot and light headed. I have passed out from shots and IVs before so I brought my own smelling salts to my appointment, and I used them as soon as I felt faint, which kept me from passing out.  I felt ok after waiting 30 minutes. Later that day around 5pm, I started getting chills and felt a little achy. At 6pm I checked my temperature and it was 99.9, at 7pm it was 101.9, at 7:30pm it was 104 so I took ibuprofen 400 since I had severe chills, headache fatigue and muscle and joint aches. At 8pm it was 102.7 so I took another 400mg of ibuprofen. At  9pm it was 101.7, and at 10pm it was 100.4 and then I went to sleep.  On 4/12: it was 98.7 when I woke up at 9am, then 99 at 10:30 so I took ibuprofen 400, then 100.1 at 11:30 so I took ibuprofen 400 again. Since noon, the fever has subsided and the fatigue and aches and headaches have become mild so that I could work from home.

Each time I took the medicine, it made me feel hazy and didn&#39;t help my headache much. I still had a migraine on the 12th. Today, the 13th I feel much better.

These lasted for about 36 hours.  48 hours after injection, I started having menstrual cramps and begin bleeding. I bled for about 1 week and then began bleeding again approximately 1-2 weeks later. This second period lasted over a week. So, I had two periods in the span of 1 month. Neither period was expected or coincided with the placebos in my birth control. I do not normally menstruate at all on my birth control pills.

After going to bed I developed chills where I couldn&#39;t get warm and I was shaking, and then it turned to sweating. The next day I was weak, achy, nauseous. That night I developed a fever too. My injection site it still warm to the touch and a little red and swollen, but is looking better. I also had stomach pains in the evening Friday and Saturday night that happened when I was nauseous too.

                                                I received the vaccine at 3:50 pm and by 9:45 I had the typical side effects --muscle aches, minor pain at the injection site, and chills.  Within an hour from that I also had a terrible headache, nausea, and my skin hurt to touch.  I slept most of the next day, save for 5 or 6 hours.  Starting on 3/30/21 (exactly two weeks from receiving my vaccine) I started having sore skin.  No rash, red marks, itching, just hypersensitive to touch, even with clothing.  This started on my right arm right above the elbow.  The following day the pain had moved to inside both arms right above the elbow.  The day after that, the pain was more intense and was straight across my stomach at belly button height, and across my lower back at that same height.  It was more intense for two days and hurt whether anything was touching my skin or not.  It was very uncomfortable.  In the days following it continued to move to different places on my body.  Legs, bottom of feet, palms of hands, ankles, hips, groin, lower back.    Sometimes it just hurts, sometimes it&#39;s like a prickling, sometimes the skin in that area aches -- especially when on my hands. It&#39;s also very sensitive to anything cold.  Again, if you look at my skin though you can&#39;t see anything.  There&#39;s no visible signs of something being wrong.  It also stopped for a day or so, or just lessened so much that it wasn&#39;t that noticeable, but then returns.  That&#39;s happened twice where I thought this was finally over, only to have it return the next day.

I also noticed soreness in the injection site for around 72 hours. On April 5, 2021 I noticed some upper back pain occurring intermittently throughout the days. This is still occurring. After contacting my healthcare professional, she feels that it is a muscle pain and most likely not related to the vaccine.

                                                This was Johnson &amp; Johnson Vaccine.  I had the normal symptoms but it still felt very severe. I think there should be emphasis shared that symptoms might be severe. I believe the public should have a clear idea how severe. From 7pm to 12am I experienced extreme temperature changes, burning hot to very cold. I had the shakes. Headache. I took Advil which helped endure.  Buried myself in blankets with heater and heat on.  Drowsy. Experienced some dizziness. Now 3 days later I have some &#39;pings&#39; here and there but uncertain if from vaccine. I feel these in my ovaries and my legs and my side. These are very subtle &#39;pings&#39; (bit of pain but not much). Unsure if worth reporting but I think all this is important. Also, I have anxiety about the effect on this vaccine on the health of women and think it is very important that this is clear before pushing people -- more specifically young women, girls, babies -- to take this, and perhaps, any vaccine. I have been told from 5 friends they experienced heavy bleeding after taking the vaccine. They may have not all taken the J&amp;J vaccine to be clear.  I do not feel great about having taken this vaccine.  I feel like i&#39;ve put myself at risk of some other complications but of course, this is based on news and fear.  I just wanted to share this experience, and I hope that, if anything, the severity of symptoms might be more broadly shared.

                                                About 5 hours after shot, I started feeling weak, tired, and nauseas with a slight headache.  I had discomfort trying to fall asleep. I woke up at 12:43AM with a throbbing headache. I was hospitalized at 18 for viral meningitis, and this was a similar, intense pain. It felt like I had a crown on,  and that crown on my head caused a very intense, throbbing, debilitating pain. I also had chattering teeth, shaking with a freezing fever. I eventually fell asleep and woke up again at 2-something. My fever and headache still intense, but now I was drenched in sweat and burning up. I wanted to get up and find my thermometer--I remember digging through my drawers and closets around my apartment,  I remember speaking but no recollection what I was trying to say (I live alone), and I remember seeing my reflection looking glazed over. I don&#39;t remember getting back in bed but woke up again after 5AM. I still had a bad headache, though less severe, and felt my body was alternating very hot sweating and very cold freezing--like it was mix and matching. I eventually fell asleep again and woke up around 7:45AM. I was fatigued with a fever and chills all day.  I found my thermometer and went to sleep with a 100.3 fever that night. I was much better next day, just slight fatigue.

                                                Four hours after vaccine administration, the patient began experiencing body aches, headache, and chills typical of post-vaccine immune response. however, three hours later (7 hours after administration), she began having a burning sensation in her thoracic back, upper chest, shoulders, and upper arms with accompanying allodynia, the patient reports was up to 10/10 intensity. She went to an emergency room and was given acetaminophen, prednisone, diphenhydramine, and famotidine. Her symptoms did not significantly improve and was discharged. The burning sensation and allodynia did resolve overnight and have not reoccurred, but these symptoms are the adverse event I am reporting.

                                                I received J&amp;J vaccine on 31st March. I?m 32 years old woman.  I?m currently out of states, I came to another Country on 9th April. About 2days ago, I observed some tiny spots on my fingers (3 on middle finger, and 1 on ring finger - refer attached image). Also, at the same time I felt little disorientation where I was almost blank for just few seconds. I believe that might be due to empty stomach/low sugar. And then, I?m having a headache today.  After the vaccination, I had a fever of 102.7 degrees for about 2days.  I?m just concerned that this is nothing to worry about. And, if there are some blood tests or scans that I should get done just to be safe.

Put on compression socks but the restless leg and shortness of breath continued for 3/4 hours.

Dr is having me rub the knot and apply heat as much as possible along with taking over the counter anti-inflammatory. Lymph nodes behind ears have now swollen.

The fever and muscle aches lasted until the following morning. Around 12pm is when I began expecting some stomach discomfort/sharp pains on the upper left hand side of my stomach. It began to increase in intensity around 4pm when I began to get nauseous. 5-6pm is when I began vomitting, and decided to go to the ER after the pain reached a level 8-9 and my face and limbs felt numb. I was admitted to the emergency room at 11:30pm and was given a CT Scan where it was discovered I had appendicitis. Wednesday evening I underwent surgery, and was discharged Thursday 4/15. I am still experiencing a slight fever and soreness at the injection site on my left arm.

                                                The first 24 hours were very difficult for me. I have never been so sick in my life. I got the typical muscle aches, chills, etc. In fact I got every side effect listed plus more. I want to discuss the other side effects. On day 3 I started to develop extreme chest pain and pressure. It is a dull pain as if someone if sitting on my chest that will not go away. I also started to experience sudden bouts of dizziness and vertigo. It will not go away. Today is Day 7 and I spent the night in the emergency room because my chest pains got so strong. However, all the work up came back okay. I also have this strange feeling of electrical shocks running thru my head, those last about .5 seconds and go away, but it is a very weird feeling I have never experienced. I also have a strange desire to constantly burp, when I do my chest pain feels better. If I don&#39;t burp my ears start to feel full and sometimes they ring. Its Day 7 and I still feel SO miserable. Why id no one speaking about these chest pains? I know 5 people who have experienced the same.

On 4/16, woke up with almost no ability to hear out of my left ear and there was a very loud ringing sound in my ear. Happened off and on throughout the day but by evening, I only heard a ringing noise. I went to the urgent care and they said my ear had no sign of ear infection or allergies.   Next morning, I couldn?t hear almost anything out of my ear with a very loud ringing noise. Was consistent through 4:30pm that day.  Went back to the urgent care and a different nurse practicing confirmed my ear looked completely normal.  I?ve never experienced deafness or ringing in my ear before.    Since this morning (4/18) I have had a low ringing sound in my left ear, but no more deafness.

By 6:30 PM I was feeling shaky and weak so I laid down. At 6:45 PM I was feeling feverish (chills even though my body was radiating heat). I woke repeatedly due to muscle soreness and chills. At 10:30 I checked my temperature and got a reading of 103.2 F. I had a mild headache as well. I drank some green fruit/vegetable juice and went back to tossing and turning on the couch. I took an Ibuprofen at 5AM with water and was able to get a couple of hours of sleep. !) AM I checked my temp again and got a reading of about 98 F. I was still feeling a bit sluggish and slightly dizzy at times throughout the day.

                                                After getting the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot at 3:15PM on Saturday (I did pass out at the vaccine clinic approx 2 minutes after receiving the vaccine and had to be escorted to a room to lay down) I developed chills, fever, and aches that night, but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m reporting.  Sunday night, I developed painful red spots on my right inner labia. Monday morning, they had multiplied and darkened. I went in and saw my gynecologist, at 2:00PM. By that time they had worsened again. She could not immediately identify it, but swabbed it to test for herpes. She also prescribed an anti-viral, a rotating dose of OTC 600 ibuprofen and 500mg tylenol, and that I should pick up Orajel for topical numbing.  By Wednesday, the herpes test came back negative (as I expected, having never had herpes), and the spots had grown in size and turned into black and grey ulcers that were shedding with necrosis and were extremely painful. In addition, I was experiencing near exhaustion.  Dr. diagnosed them as Lipshütz ulcers. A severe immune response to the vaccine. In addition to the antiviral, she prescribed a steroid to help quiet the immune response and a few days worth of Hydrocodone to help with the very acute pain.  As of writing this on 4/20/2021, I am still not fully recovered, although Dr. believes it will be cleared up completely in the next couple of days.

My chest starts to feel tight and my upper back my arms were tingling. My right calf and right lower abdomen began having a sharp pain. About 25 minutes later I began sweating and felt like my chest was going to rupture. My heart was racing. Broke out in hives. After about 8 hours I was bedridden Ill. I was puking, fevering, headache and could not move my body I was in so much pain. I was afraid to go to sleep cause I thought I was going to die.

There after I started to experience severe, constant headaches that come and go. My headaches are worse when bending down. I went to hospital and they performed lab work and told me it was a reaction to the vaccine. To this day my headaches come and go every day.

                                                Around 3:00pm on 3/7/21 I began to feel a little tired. But 3:45pm I was experiencing muscle pain through my body at only continued to get worse. At 4:30pm I took 400mg of ibuprofen since sitting, walking, and lying down were all painful. Relief came around 5:30pm and I was able to nap for an hour. At 6:30pm I awoke and attempted to eat, as I was beginning to feel nauseous. At 8:30pm I laid down again, my symptoms returning and worsening. I was now experiencing chills with my muscle pain and a headache. Pain was located throughout my body and my skin was sensitive to the touch. At 10:30pm I began shaking violently and struggled to feel warm, despite my skill feeling hot. My temperature was not taken. Another 400mg of ibuprofen was taken and one 350mg chewable of Tums anti-acid was eaten. It was not until 12:30am that I was able to sleep again.  The morning of 3/8/21 I was still fatigued and sore. Moving was difficult and painful and nausea was still present, and my headache returned. I was unable to eat despite trying. At 10:00am I took two tablets of Excedrin Migrain and napped for almost two hours. Currently, my muscle aches are minimal and my headache has improved. This may however be due to the medication.

The arm that I got the shot in was immediately sore, and has continued to be a bit tender to touch and stiff when I move the arm. By 5pm I was feeling very fatigued. Around 7pm I began feeling cold and achy, and it has continued to progress to full body aches and chills. I have no appetite, but I?m not feeling nauseous.

I delayed taking Ibuprofen to not reduce the efficiency of the vaccine but couldn&#39;t endure the chills and shivering as well as the massive pain all over my body. I started with 200 mg Ibuprofen, which helped with all 3 symptoms at least as far as I was able to sit instead of lie all the time.

I have had no complications so far in my pregnancy. On the day after receiving the vaccine, I developed a severe headache, congestion, dehydration, and fatigue. I felt feverish and had chills, but I did not have a fever. I was unable to go about my daily activities (I was not working on this day). These symptoms went away about 36 hours after being vaccinated. I also had pain at the injection site.

At 4pm I had chills and then started having contractions every 5 minutes. I called my OBGYN who recommended that I drink fluids and lay on my side to decrease the presumed Braxton Hicks contractions. This did not decrease the contractions. I came to the hospital where I was admitted to labor and delivery with contractions 2-4 minutes apart and a 99.6 degree temperature. I was given an oral medication to stop the contractions, a 2 part series of injections to speed up lung development of my unborn child, and IV fluids were administered.

I started vomiting every hour from 1:30pm to 7pm the following day, Friday 3/12/21. After my first time vomiting I took two, 25mg MECLIZINE tablets but they did not help.  I could not keep anything down. I tried Water, Ginger Ale, Crackers, and Gatorade.  The all came back up within the hour. It got to the point where I was throwing up foam and green bile because my stomach was empty. I tried to eat again around 10pm and threw up again around 11:25pm. The following day, Saturday 3/13/21, I felt fine when I woke up until I started moving around. I threw up red vomit twice around midday and decided not to eat or drink anything and rest. Later that evening, around 7:30pm, I was able to eat a bland salad that didn&#39;t come back up. Today. 3/14/21, I am back to normal but my throat, stomach, and lower back are all sore from vomiting.

                                                On the first day, I had fever, chills, aches and pains , and a head ache.  Second day- swollen lymph nodes under the arm, aches and pains,.  Third day - head ache  and muscle fatigue   5th day- starting at 4am. I woke up with skin itching. I noticed a rash on my arm where injection was. It then spread to back, other arm, legs, neck , ankles and knees. Took Benadryl and Zyrtec by doctors orders. The rash went away- but then six hours later returned and has grown. I also have to take more Benadryl since the same amount has not helped the rash disappear.

At midnight I woke up extremely hot, as if I had a fever (I didn&#39;t confirm this with a thermometer, I was just extremely hot and sweaty) and I had a very severe, painful headache that lasted at least 30 minutes until I took two acetaminophen pills. I also experienced the usual muscle pains. All symptoms were gone by Saturday morning upon waking.

                                                Yesterday I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I was the last appointment, so they observed me for 5 minutes, and I left. After riding in the car for a few minutes, I noticed that I was having a hard time breathing and my throat felt like it was starting to swell. By that time, the clinic was closed, so I went to the emergency room just in case and sat in my car since they didn&#39;t allow people to sit in the waiting room because if covid.  It started becoming increasingly difficult to breathe, and I was feeling more and more swelling of my throat and tongue. I was having a lot of dizziness, nausea, facial flushing, palpitations, and some mild confusion. I then started getting numbness in the bottom half of my face. Over time, the numbness spread, mostly staying on the left side of my body (face, scalp, lower arms and legs, left side on tongue and inside of mouth). I also started getting a prickling burning pain sensation for brief periods of time where I had numbness. I had decided that if my breathing worsened at all, I would go to the er even though I can&#39;t afford it.   After about an hour and a half, my breathing started to feel less constricted and like there was less resistance. The swelling in my throat was mostly in the upper throat where I had difficulty swallowing but not as much difficulty breathing. The numbness continued to get worse and was sometimes disappearing and reappearing in the same spot.  At 9:30 pm we went to go get some benadryl. I continued feeling less and less swelling and having an easier time breathing. At that point, I went home. Once I was home, my breathing continued to improve and the numbness started to dissipate.  In the middle of the night, I started itching and getting widespread hives and getting a sharp burning pricking pain that would last a few seconds in different areas. The numbness also started coming back mostly in my face. I continued to have difficulty swallowing.  I am feeling much better today. I still feel some slight swelling in my throat when I swallow, but my breathing is fine. I&#39;m still itchy and occasionally breaking out in hives. Im having mild lower facial numbness. I&#39;m also starting to get the normal side effects of fever, headache, arm soreness, and body aches. I&#39;m taking benadryl every 4 hours.

                                                I had general fatigue and headaches. The after I woke up my left arm was red and puffy. Overnight the area had doubled in size, itchy and painful. The area was circular and 2-3 inches in diameter. I went to Urgent care and they gave me Benadryl and a Steroid to take. The area is still painful and swollen and is starting to improve. It has been seven days and the area is still red swollen, warm and itchy. I have three more days of Steroid medication left. I just had a headache and fatigue for the first couple of days.

At 10:30 when I took my temperature, it was 101 and chills set  in.  For the remainder of the day I alternated with tylenol and advil.  Aches and fever remained the rest of the day.  By Saturday morning, fever was down and it was only 99.8.  The only side effect on Saturday was a sore arm and headache.  All symptoms were gone by Sunday morning.

                                                Received vaccine at approximately 12:30 pm  on 3/15/21 at 13 weeks pregnant (due date of 9/15/21). Weight and height 5&#39;0&#34;, approximates 136lbs.   During injection there was a pain from the needle insert and immediate soreness. I would describe it as more painful than the flu shot that I received in November of 2021. I was then escorted to a chair for a 15 minute observation period. I did not have any allergic reactions to the shot. I continued to feel slight soreness in my left arm for the rest of the day.  At approximately 8 pm I began to feel &#34;aches and pains&#34; similar to those during a cold and flu. I took (1) regular strength Tylenol Acetaminophen 325 mg tablet. I began to feel a little bit warm around 9-10 pm and checked my temperature with an infrared thermometer and it was slightly elevated by a degree (no exact measurement). I  went to bed at approximately 11:30 pm.   At approximately 12:45 am I woke up and took my temperature. I first used the infrared thermometer and it came back as 99.4 F. I felt very warm so I then switched to an Oral thermometer for accuracy and began to record the following: 101.1 F - 12:45am (was under blankets so got out of bed to cool off) / 100.0 F - 1:05 am / 100.9 F - 1:20 am  At 1:10am I used a cold compress (small ice pack wrapped in a kitchen towel) to cool off and then took a luke-warm shower at 1:15 am (did not wet hair). I also drank a big water bottle of water (Tap Water) probably around 500ml. The room temperature was around 74 F. I re-measured my temp at 1:40 am and it decreased to 99.3 F. I took a 2nd Tylenol tablet (same as above) at 2 am. My temperature at 2:05 am was 100.0 F.  I then went in and out of sleep and recorded my temps every time I woke up and went to the bathroom / drank more water. 98.5 F at 3:55 am / 98.4 F at 5:55 am / 99.0 at 7:25 am. At 7:30am I took a 3rd &amp; 4th Tylenol. Temp at 7:55am was 99.4F. I went back to sleep and then woke up at 9am to login remotely for work. Temp at 9:25 am was 98.7.  I then took a nap from 9:30 am to 12:00 pm (my boss told me to go to sleep after our call) and slept very soundly. When I woke up I felt a lot better. Aches and pains were no longer present and fever appeared to be gone. The worst of the symptoms were over. I then spot checked my temp a few times throughout the day: 98.0F at 12:15pm / 98.3 F at 1:40pm / 98.7 at 2:05 pm. At 2:15 pm I took a 5th Tylenol just in case. I took my last official temp at 2:20pm at 98.3 F.   At about 3pm 3/16 I had a telehealth visit with my OBGYN. She said that my symptoms were normal and everything looked ok. My test results from my 12 week sonogram I had 2 weeks prior were all OK as well. To my knowledge the baby is tracking healthy. Note that during the whole time I did not experience any symptoms related to the baby. No cramps or pains in my abdomen. I am happy to share any past or future data about my pregnancy if anyone reading this is interested in contacting me.  I then randomly measured my temp until bed but it never came back as higher than normal (didn?t write it down). Slept through the next night normal and woke up normal temp as well. I would say I was more tired than usual on 3/17 but did not have any more flu like symptoms. The only thing that remained was a soreness at the injection site. It was at the spot of injection and also kind of the general area. The pain/feeling completely went away by the end of the week 3/19.   This is a very long description of symptoms. I don?t know if it?s helpful or if anyone even read all of it. But I?m just writing it down for record.

It is now the following Friday so 1 week later and arm still sore and there is a hard lump near injection site and bruised. Other than arm soreness for the entire week, I feel fine with no other adverse side effects.

                                                About a minute after I had the injection, my arm started hurting and it felt like hot water was coursing through my veins. I got an immediate headache that progressed into light headedness, my vision got blurry and I saw colors and then I started to lose my hearing, it felt like there was cotton in my ears. The nurses said I went pale and they called it a panic attack, but it was unlike any panic attack I have ever had in my life. I?ve had my TDAP updated a few years ago and got a flu shot and did not feel anything like this. I was rolled out of the room on a wheel chair because I was too dizzy to walk and then threw up several times into a bag and peed myself. It took about 20 minutes before I felt normal again.   The following day my arm felt numb and incredibly sore, I couldn?t raise it that far up without excruciating pain. I felt weak, fatigued and dizzy and was unable to use the bathroom. I had fever sweats and chills on and off. I was not able to sleep well, but I think that?s because of the pain in my arm.

I wasn?t tired though, just so freezing cold and sore all over. I couldn?t sleep because the discomfort was so bad. I was probably 70 degrees in my house and I was in fleece pajamas and had 3 blankets and was still freezing all night. No fever though, oddly.

I woke at 3am with severe chills and shaking. I had a fever of 101.5. I took Tylenol Extra Stength and that helped.  Had trouble sleeping but managed to fall back asleep for a little bit. Upon waking, I had a head, muscle aches, and a fever. I kept taking the Tylonel every 6 hours throughout the entire day. My fever got as high as 102.1. It broke around 7pm on March 18th. My shoulder where the vaccine was injected was sore through Saturday, March 20th. I had muscle aches and weakness through Saturday, March 20th.

This lasted from about 7pm the night of the vaccine until around 3:30 in the morning, despite alternating Tylenol and ibuprofen.  The chills and muscle soreness alone were debilitating.   I filled vsafe today when I signed up but it did not give me the option to add yesterday?s symptoms so I am reporting them here. Today symptoms have been milder, mostly fatigue and no fever.

Started experiencing fogginess and feeling cold at 1:00 am 20Mar2021. Went to bed at 1:00 and dreamed of being sick until waking up at 8:30 am 20Mar2021. Woke up and was very weak (could not push toothpaste through toothpaste tube), almost passed out in trying, so I sat on the floor. Tried getting back to bed and was extremely nauseous and started vomiting. After that, I had the sweats/fever/chills for a couple hours (until ~11:00am), and was fatigued until 4:00 pm. Spent most of the day sleeping, unable to do anything. Today, 22Mar2021, feel slight tingling on palm of left hand and fingers. Injection site is still sore and bruised

By Tuesday evening, 8 pm, I noticed extreme Breast tenderness and I called my doctorand talked to the nurse  - lactation nurses - on the 17th.That persisted for more than 48 hours. (I am breastfeeding.) When I bent over, I had chest pain with that. Told to monitor it and if I got a fever to call back to call the doctor.  Didn&#39;t get fever and my tenderness in my breasts went away and so did  the body aches.

But the exhausted next day - I went home from work early that day. Friday, I got a rash  - very itchy and sore  (it felt very tender when touched)- on my left side (abdomen). It spread around the left side on my back and to my stomach. I say my doctor on this Tuesday (virtual appt) said it was Shingles - Valtrex - to help it heal faster. The rash is starting to scab over and is peeling now.  It&#39;s getting better.

By March 9 all side effects had resolved.

Treated with iburprofen and odansetron at approximately 3:30 AM. Fever, nausea, and vomiting subsided due to medication. Muscle/joint pain remained at a lessened level. High levels of fatigue emerged in the early morning hours. Took sumatriptan for migraine at around noon and again later that evening. Fever resurfaced when ibuprofen wore off around noon. Had to leave work early due to fever, muscle/joint pain, and migraine. Took another dose of ibuprofen around that time and again in the evening. Fatigue lasted until approximately 48 hours later. All other symptoms subsided within 24 hours.

                                                Low fever under 100 degrees early on. Sometime between 7-8 PM fever spiked and was found by husband at 8, who had been in a meeting for the previous hour, curled up on the couch with a fever between 103-104. Was put into cold water bath and given ibuprofen. Temperature stabilized and started to slowly drop. Once temperature was under 103 got out of bath and monitored temperature every 5-10 minutes as it dropped for first hour. At 1 AM tried to get some sleep and set alarm to check temperature again at 2, at which point it was under 100 degrees. Next alarm was set for 7 AM, but was woken up at 6:30 AM due to moaning and temperature was again over 101. Took more ibuprofen and temperature again dropped. Will continue to take ibuprofen as needed to keep fever in check. Other side effects are not as significant, and include headache, body aches, and chills.

The next night I had some chills and shaking (though not as bad). The following day I had a headache and fatigue but no fever.

                                                Approximately 5 hours after I received the vaccine, I started to feel extremely fatigued and experienced some muscle aches. I took an Aleve and laid down for an hour long nap. At approximately 7:00pm, I woke up with more extreme muscle pain. By 8:00pm, my muscles were so tight and painful that it hurt to move, lay still, or go to the bathroom. It felt as though all of the muscles in the back of my body (from my back to my butt and legs) were spasming, Over the next few hours, my temperature rose to 102.7 and my heart rate spiked to 140-150 bpm. I also experienced chills and a headache. We sought the advice of a 24-hour nurse, who let us know these symptoms were likely normal side effects. I went to bed around 12:00am, and my temperature had dropped to 99.9 around 3:00am when I woke up to check it.  My heart rate eventually dropped below 100 bpm around 8:00am. I woke up around 10:00am on Saturday feeling much better than the day before. My temperature was around 99.1 when I woke up, and my symptoms included mild muscle aches, a moderate headache, and moderate fatigue. I continued to feel better throughout the day, with the headache gradually subsiding and a minor sore throat toward the end of the day. On Sunday, I felt back to normal, other than experiencing some mild-moderate fatigue.

By midnight, I had a fever of 100.2, nausea, intense headache (specifically around the eyes) and overall significant discomfort. The fever lasted overnight. Vomiting occurred on several occasions shortly after midnight for a few hours and again around 6 am. The following day, my fever did go down yet I maintained a headache and some nausea. After 3 days, adverse events were resolved. Treatment consisted of tylenol and fluids. I did not contact my a physician, so no medical tests/lab work was completed. For background, I have never experienced a serious event with a vaccine, besides general fatigue.

Then my head starting hurting and I felt extremely hot. My legs and chest were pink and hot to the touch. Very high fever, head pain , nausea and heart palpitations. I took Tylenol which helped with the fever. The next day I had some minor aches and dizziness. Later the same day, I had  sharp aches/pains down my back and an upset stomach. That night I had a fever again but not as high. Today, two days later, I feel back to normal with the occasional ache or cramp.

                                                Almost immediately, I had pain in my arm that shot into my shoulder when the vaccine was being injected into my arm. I did not mention it to the pharmacist since I figured it was normal. I sat for 15 minutes as instructed, but  other than feeling sore, I was normal. So we left. After about another 15 mins, My head started for feel &#34;drunk&#34;. I contemplated pulling over since I was driving home, but decided to get home asap.  As time went by, my head felt more and more cloudy, fuzzy, heavy and as if I&#39;d been drinking alcohol. That night, I couldn&#39;t sleep. I even took hydrocodon with tylenol (the pain was that bad) and an ibprofin. It helped a little. I finally got to sleep at 3am, Just to wake at 7am for work. All day, I could not focus, my head was super fuzzy. I had a bad headache, I felt super sick. My stomach also hurt and I couldn&#39;t lift my arm. I tried taking a nap half way through the day because I kept making mistakes at work. It did not help how I felt. Since then, my symptoms have eased but now I seem to have a bad case of acid reflux, which I didn&#39;t used to get randomly.   I have not been to my dr yet and I haven&#39;t done anything else for it. I was informed that I should report my symptoms by a family friend.

I have had a horrible nagging cough since having this shot. I got the shot on 3/14/21 ... it is now 1 month later and I still have it. I can be talking fine and then all of a sudden cough. I cough all day and all night. I never should have gotten this vaccine.  My cough will not go away. I am in the healthcare field which is why I got this injection and now I regret it. I also tested POSITIVE to COVID 1 week after getting the shot. I lost all sense of taste and smell and felt horrible. I got tested for COVID on 3/21 and found positive.

I felt better for a few days and then I had the worse headache of my life on 04/11/2021. Went to the ER for the second time on 04/12/2021.  They didn&#39;t find anything abnormal in examination, was discharged home and was advised to contact my primary care provider.

I soon had a 103.7 fever with chills and a terrible splitting headache. My symptoms lasted through the night. I took one 200mg Ibuprofen at 03:30 saturday morning/it didn&#39;t seem to help much. Most of the day saturday I had a headache that was manageable and 100.2 degree fever. Saturday evening I was fever free and had a dull headache. Sunday, I was exhausted.

                                                Started with chills pretty shortly after the vaccine was injected.  After about 6 hours I could tell I was not feeling great.  My husband said I looked very pale and out of it all of the sudden.  I became extremely tired and disoriented.  I don?t remember driving myself home that evening after picking up my kids from dance.  By the time I was home it was now around 8 pm.  I was so cold my entire body was trembling.  I kept taking steaming hot showers but I couldn?t feel it, I was still freezing and shaking.  I was very weak and started having extremely horrible body aches and pains.  Specifically my legs were hurting the worst, I remember my hip joints felt like they?d buckle underneath me.  I got a headache that was unbearable.  It felt worse than a migraine.  It hurt to move my head or use my eyes at all.  I went to bed and was under several blankets and a heating pad while also running a space heater right next to me.  I still could not get warm at all.  I hallucinated that I could see each ache and pain on my body and watched them move through me.  By 4 am I was now hysterical and crying.  I was in so much unbearable pain and so scared.  I had to call off of work for this day.  I was so out of it I called my daughter off of school but also called for my mom to come get her and take her to school.  I kept my youngest home with me.  My head was still the absolute worst headache I have ever felt in my life.  I couldn?t open my eyes and it hurt to move at all.  I had to call a friend to come pick up my youngest daughter because I was unable to take care of her, I could barely stay awake and alert.  I tried another hot shower and everything still felt cold.  I was now nauseous from the head pain.  Around noon on this day I finally had the strength to drink some water and was able to take Tylenol.  I laid on the couch for hours still shivering and in unbearable pain.  I was still very scared that I was having such a bad reaction that I would die.  I called my husband to come home from work and be with me because I was scared.  I took more Tylenol a couple hours after the first dose.  Around 6 pm I started to feel better.  I was able to eat again that evening.  I had a headache though for about 3 weeks after that gradually weaned away.

Woke up in middle of the night with high fever, cold sweats, and migraine. By morning migraine intensified, could not stand for more than a few minutes without feeling faint and waves of nausea, complete loss of appetite and felt extremely dehydrated and lethargic. Sore arm at injection site started second day and progressively got worse day 3 and 4. 36 hours after vaccine was when I felt more able to eat, walk around, migraine reduced to a dull headache. Fatigue lingered in day to day activities for about 1 week.

I had the expected side effects of headache, chills, body aches, fatigue and fever (102.6 F) but began to experience symptoms of pounding/racing heart that worsened through the evening. By 10:00 pm my heart rate was bouncing around between 130 bpm and 155 bpm, and I was beginning to have pain in my lower legs/ankles.  Was told by a on call nurse for my clinic to go to the ER. I was in the ER for about 5 hours, roomed the whole time as they worked to get my heart rate down and checked to make sure I didn&#39;t have a blood clot. They performed an EKG and CT Scan of my chest, both were fine. I was eventually allowed to leave after 4 am on 4/10/21 after my heart rate got into the high 90&#39;s with only small spikes into the 110&#39;s with slight movement and once my fever had broken.

I was in bed.  3/20?got period 3/21?I was gushing blood like never before in my entire life. I went through a menstral cup in 1.5 hours.    This excessive cycle lasted for days. My period is normally 3/4  days and this one was 6/7 days. I also passed 3 golf ball sized blood clots. I have never in my life passed a clot, let alone three that size.  The next cycle I had a tiny bit of break through bleeding the day I ovulated?that never happens. Then this cycled I have felt crampy and bloated. Like I am going to start my period at any minute but do not.  I am expecting my next period in less than a week. But this cycle has been completely abnormal and nothing changed but getting the shot two days prior to it starting.

                                                Approximately five hours after receiving the shot, I developed a headache. Within 12 hours, I had chills, sweats, and fever for approximately 12 hours. The morning after receiving the shot, I developed neck and shoulder pain which became more sever on the next 2-3 days. The neck and shoulder pain has been ongoing for 5 weeks since receiving the shot on the injection side. I have seen my primary care physician twice, most recently to rule out a blood clot (yesterday 4/13). I have also received physical therapy. There was no neck injury or pain prior to the vaccine.

When it was severe, it felt like a sharp pain that made me wince. I took Tylenol once or twice a day and it helped. The headache was very intermittent - sometimes it was every few minutes, hours, and sometimes it was a few times within the same minute.

She has tried over-the-counter Tylenol/Ibuprofen and topical Diclofenac gel with little to no relief of her pain. This is made daily living difficult. She also works as a daycare provider. She had some increased headaches 2-3 days after the vaccine, but these have seemed to resolve.

Within a couple hours I had body aches, chills, congestion, &amp; dizziness became more severe. Within 3 hrs dizziness was debilitating &amp; I had to go home from work. Next day fever, congestion, &amp; body aches were gone. The dizziness was worse. I slept all day Sunday &amp; Monday thinking I would be better the next day. On Tuesday I was still very dizzy my mom convinced me to go to the doctor. The nurse from the doctor&#39;s office told me to go to immediate care, &amp; the doctor from immediate care sent me to the ER. I&#39;m still dizzy &amp; unable to work.

                                                The day after receiving the vaccine, I experienced common side effects of fever, chills, body aches, and nausea, which lasted for 24 hours, and then I felt better. Then, 3 days after receiving the vaccine, I suddenly began to have extreme stomach pain, so bad that I could barely walk or stand up straight. My chest felt tight and I had shortness of breath. I thought about going to the ER, but called my GI specialist instead as I thought it could be related to the Xifaxan I was taking, but the office was already closed. The GI office called the following Monday and said the Xifaxan should not cause extreme stomach pain and to go to the ER if it persists, but by this time I was feeling much better. The severe pain lasted two days in total.

She called the RN line and was told to take ibuprofen and follow up in the AM. The next day 4/18/2021, patient went to urgent care and received Toradol and was told it was a migraine. Today 4/20/21, patient still had pain and noted feeling left sided facial numbness and blurry vision that correlated with when she got the headache. Patient went to an urgent care today and CT scan revealed a blood clot. She was then sent to the ED for evaluation. In the ED, she has no headache and facial numbness and has minimal left ear pain. Her headache is localized to the left side of her head. Patient denies fever, chills, and COVID symptoms. Patient was started on argatroban drip per hematology recommendation.

                                                After two weeks, the injection site is still sore, but mostly, my joints including wrists, knee, ankles are still extremely achy and throbbing persistently. I have experienced sinus pressure headaches as well. My legs and arms feel tingly and numb at times - more often my left side which is where I got injection. I feel weakness and fatigue most afternoons. My body didn&#39;t feel this way before the vaccine and it seems as though my body hasn&#39;t fully recovered from the shot and has flared up these symptoms. I feel all of a sudden that I have arthritis.

Around day 11-12, she was noted by family to have deterioration in ambulatory function and language skills, prompting a visit to a local ED. By day 13 she had lapsed into a vegetative state in which she could only yawn, moan and occasionally open eyes. MRI brain demonstrated significant, confluent T2 intensities in the subcortical white matter of the bilateral cerebral hemispheres.

The headaches became migraine like in quality with photosensitivity and a one-sided pounding that was debilitating and associated with nausea. The headaches respond to migraine treatment (Sumatriptan) started after the vaccine, but she has never had migraines before. The migraines continue almost every day until today, 4/27/2021. Due to the onset of new migraine-like headaches with no prior history, a workup and neurologic exam was done twice which was normal both times (see below). However, it seems significant that someone has new daily migraine headaches for longer than 3 weeks after the vaccine was given so we are reporting it.

At around 9:00 PM I had chills, migraine, bodyaches, burning sensation in my joints, neck pain, and a low-grade fever. I took some Tylenol at around 7 PM. But the pain did not subside and I was able to use the bathroom the next day at around 4 AM and was still in severe pain. That day at around 1 PM I was able to set up and felt 30% better. On day two I am feeling better but I still have minor body aches I do get fatigue while doing light work around the house and no appetite and loss of taste is the newest symptom. I am not 100 percent better but close to it.

                                                I received the vaccine at 9am on Saturday, March 6th. My arm was immediately very sore throughout the day. Around 9:30pm that night I began to feel nauseous. As the night progressed my symptoms got worse. I experienced intense chills and by 11pm had a 100 degree fever. Sunday, March 7th my fever had decreased, but I continued to feel nauseous and have chills throughout the day. Additionally I felt extremely fatigued, weak, and had a throbbing headache. Completing simple tasks were difficult and exhausting. Monday, March 8th I continue to experience significant fatigue, headache, and muscle weakness, but at less intensity. Also, my right arm where I received the injection is very sore. I have also been somewhat dizzy today. I have been taking Advil, drinking fluids, using an ice pack, and resting as much as I can as part of the treatment.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Experienced strong muscular back pain, mostly lumbar but pain felt across entire back. Normal existing body pains also felt amplified.  Strong fatigue as if I had engaged in arduous physical activity but had not.   Took Advil PM night of vaccine and woke up feeling no pain but slight headache. Took excedrin extra strength in anticipation for headache escalating and felt no further pain until 4:30 pm the day after vaccine. Pain more intense, took 800mg of ibuprofen at 6pm and pain was alleviated by 8pm. Took Advil PM again night 2, and woke up with no pain again. Now 4:45pm of day 3 and not feeling pain but it could return when effects of Excedrin wear off.

                                                About 6 hours after receiving the Janssen shot, I came down with a fever, muscle aches and chills. My fever peaked at about midnight with a temperature of 101.8. At that point, I took two Tylenol. Had a rough night and didn&#39;t sleep well. Continued taking Tylenol the following day to manage the low grade fever. I seem to back mostly back to normal today (two days after receiving the vaccine), however I do still have soreness in my left arm where I got the shot and some residual aches and pains.

                                                I had some sort of reaction to the vaccine about 1-2 minutes after receiving it, and it was super scary and they had to call the paramedics.   After the pharmacist injected me, I felt the arm pain right away. No big deal. I walked over to the chair to sit for my 15 minutes. I was happy to be vaccinated and kind of saw it as my mini booster for my immune system that already beat COVID-19. As I sat there, the only thing I could say is, I felt a tingling cold sensation moving from my arm through me. Almost like I could feel the vaccine moving through my system. The tingling kept moving and I thought to myself, okay cool. I guess it&#39;s working. Awesome. But then my head felt cold, I felt tingling in my head, my mouth tasted like metal, saliva started to build in my mouth, I started to sweat, I felt overly sweaty all over my body, but my head felt cold and tingly.   I was staring straight ahead and everything started to go staticky, like a television set, and the static began to build and started to get starry. Everything in my vision started to fade. So I spoke out to say something weird was happening.  A man came over to talk to me and hold me up. He kept saying stuff but then my ears started ringing and I couldn&#39;t hear him anymore. I began to fade out as the stars got more intense. Then, as if it was just a mini reboot, my brain started to come back online and the picture in front of me began to fade back into view. I felt nauseous and still had a super metal taste in my mouth. They called the paramedics to give me a checkup. The metal taste in my mouth stayed the longest, but after about 45 minutes I felt well enough to go home.  On and off, I have this intense tingling inside my brain. It reminds me of a time when I was in the hospital on morphine. Just a tingling pins and needles sensation inside my head. Other than that, I am okay now. But I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s some sort of reaction because I already had COVID-19.

I assumed it was from looking at my phone while I waited for the 15 minute wait to be up, but the pain never stopped, but it did move around my body. Fever every evening starting the day after the shot. Searing muscular pain since shot, worsens when fever happens, and the pain is moving throughout my body. On Monday, It is day 3 after the shot and my arm is swelling more today than any other day. Advil 400mg every 4 hours, rest, and plenty of fluids.

When I woke up two hours later I was freezing cold and my body was very achy. I ended up sleeping the rest of the day and night. On Friday I felt fine most of the day until about 10pm at night when I started having diarrhea. Throughout the night it got worse and my body got very hot to the point where I had to sleep naked with fans on me. I?m lightly short of breath, exhausted, and am still having diarrhea now (Sat).

                                                Out of nowhere got a headache felt extremely hot and dizzy. Then lost consciousness and fell to the ground. Was white as a ghost.  Once I came to my hand and arms were numb and tingling. I was sweating but cold. Ambulance was called and they took my vitals and blood sugar. Everything was normal. After about 10 mins I was able to stand and felt better after getting all of my color back. I have felt fine the rest of the day besides some fatigue and body aches.

It gets slightly better with tylenol.

Injection site was hot to the touch and did swell a bit. The following day I went through strong waves of feeling very ill and then feeling ok for about an hour, then back to having chills, nauseous, headache, body ache, and extremely lethargic. Half way through second day I broke out in a rash all over my chest, tummy, and back. Entering into day 3 ( today ) I do feel better, but can&#39;t shake the brain fog and feelings of being tired. Rash is still present currently.

I couldn?t walk 3 feet without having to sit with my head between my knees. I passed out in a 5 foot walk but luckily i sat down on my couch as it was happening. I?m not diabetic, haven?t ever been hypoglycemic. Ibuprofen and food after about 2 or 3 hours is a must.

While I was sitting down, waiting for about 15 minutes I felt dizzy and fainted. My head hit the floor. The store called the paramedics. I woke up sweating and the paramedics arrived. The paramedics took my bloodpressure and reported it at 84 over 50. They waited while I felt ready to stand up. After a 3 to 4 minutes I felt I could stand up and they took me outside. Once outside they took my blood pressure again and it was at 110/80. I opted to go home instead of the hospital and I feel tired.

                                                4/8/21:  I receive the injection at 1:50pm on my left arm.  8pm: I begin experiencing normal side effects: soreness, body aches, and headache.  9pm: In addition to the soreness, body aches, and headache, I start having chills, which last on and off throughout the night. 4/9/21:  7am: I feel fatigued, with headache and body aches throughout the morning and afternoon. 3pm: I begin to have some itchiness on my forehead and both ears. My right knee cap feels hot and bruised, but there is no mark. 5pm: Visible hives appear on my forehead and right knee cap, and my ears are red. All of these spots are very itchy and uncomfortable.  9pm: The hives begin to be much more noticeable and itchier. I take one Benadryl before going to bed which helps the itchiness somewhat. 4/10/21  3:30am: I am woken up by pain in my ears and they have gotten incredible swollen, red, and hot. They are very tender to the touch. I take another tablet of Benadryl.  7am: There are more hives on my forehead and cheeks, as well as my knee and now on two of my fingers. A few spots also appear on my feet and on one toe. My ears are less swollen but still not back to normal, and they are still red, hot and tender.  9am: I have a video call with a Physician?s Assistant who determines it is most likely not an anaphylactic reaction (no swelling in my throat or eyes or any of the other red flag symptoms. I also take my blood pressure with a home monitor and it is normal). He prescribes me a steroid pack.  12pm: The hives begin to be less and less itchy and red.  8pm: The hives are almost completely gone, save for a few spots on my feet. As I am breastfeeding my 14-month-old daughter, I had waited to begin the steroid pack until after our last nursing session of the day (around 7:30pm). As the hives seemed to be going away on their own, I decide to not take the medication. I do take one dose of Zyrtec. 4/11/21:  7am: the hives are completely gone

That same night I began having a horrible headache, and my muscles and joints began aching and hurting. It felt like I was holding a two ton rock over my head when I would try to walk. I took Benadryl and used Sarna lotion for the itching, and took tylenol for the headache and muscle aches. IF symptoms don&#39;t subside, then I will visit the clinic at my job to be treated and see what they could recommend.

I pulled muscles in my neck and back because I could not stop shivering. Around 9:30pm the shivering stopped and I became extremely overheated - I took tylenol every 4 hours (which was all I could take because I am breastfeeding) and my temperature still reached 103.8 and I threw up several times throughout the night. My fever broke around 4am. I have had stomach pain every day since then and do not know when it will stop or what to do about it.

                                                I received the J&amp;J one-dose vaccine on Thursday, April 8, at approx. 1600. Within an hour I had a mild headache and was nauseous. I went to sleep around 2130. At 0030 (or 30 minutes past midnight) I was awoken to the sudden shock of feeling very cold. My temperature was 91, within 15 minutes I spiked to 100 degrees, and then 15 minutes later I was at 102. I was shivering but felt like I was on fire. I had intense pain throughout my entire body. Internally and topically (skin) my entire body felt like it was on fire -- a burning sensation. Clothes -- even a soft hoodie -- felt like a steel wool scrubber was brushing against my skin and my skin was very hot to touch. I continued to feel nauseous.  After 90 minutes of this, I was able to take acetaminophen (2 x 500 mg). After another 90 minutes, my temperature dipped to 99 and the horrible pain mostly subsided.   From 0530 to 1830, in three-hour increments, my temperature continued to spike and fall between 99-101 degrees and the pain came in the same waves. Nausea continued. So, I continued an acetaminophen regimen throughout the day to help with the symptoms and took a few tums to help too.  After 1830, I felt very weak and tired. My temperature stabilized at normal. Nausea continued.   On Saturday, April 10, I was mostly just tired and had minor body aches/soreness. My shoulder bruised where I was vaccinated. Food did not sit well and my stomach was quick to turn.   Sunday, April 11, mostly back to normal. Although, still fatigued. No major side effects or symptoms.   Monday, April 12, seems to be the same as Sunday.   Note: I had COVID the first week of February 2021.

Back started to hurt and couldn&#39;t get comfortable. Then the whole body started to ache. Quickly the whole body and skin hurt and food and drink tasted bad. Started becoming cold and had to wrap a blanket around. Went to bed and had to take Tylenol every four hours to sleep. Woke up and body aches and feeling cold continued the rest of the day. There was also nausea and headaches on and of the whole day. Went back to work the following day but felt heavily nauseous for most of the day and couldn&#39;t eat or drink much of the day.

Almost 24 hours later I?m still experiencing cold chills. I also developed full body aches to where my bones feel like they are breaking and weak. Around 10 PM I started vomiting and that lasted for a couple of hours. At 2 AM a headache started and is still going on as of 9:46 AM. My bones pop and feel weak.  At other times my body will become extremely hot and soaked in sweat just to go back to cold chills.

                                                Became tired around 8pm, followed by chills, fever 101.8, sweats(taken around 12:30am), weakness, joint pain, and nausea. The fever and chills lasted around 5 hours. The following day I was weak in my hands and joints were sore.   I am a breastfeeding mom and my son broke out in a rash the following day. He was brought to the doctor. No data to show a correlation though.

Got very clammy and sweaty and weak - immediately left the store and started projectile vomiting outside the store and all night the first night. Had extremely joint/bone pain throughout my entire body for 4 days straight in bed, very weak, chills and night sweats, day 2 I had a little energy and drove about an hour and immediately started vomiting again  for day 2-day 5. Day 5 I woke up with swollen eye lids and hands and thought it was an allergic reaction to something in my house so took benedryl, but didn?t help. The swelling went down on day 6. I?ve had no energy and very foggy brain and been very down. My chest has felt like an anxiety attack 24/7 all week. I am on day 10 since the vaccination and my chest pain has increased. I still have foggy brain and been very out of it and weak still. I vomited day 1-day 5. Really bad pain in my hips and arm where I received the shot.

                                                I received the vaccine at noon on Saturday. 12 hours later I experienced severe chills and body aches which lasted 12 hours. Late afternoon on Monday I began experience sharp pains on the left side of my head, in my left inner ear, my left temple, behind my eye and above my eye to the upper part of my left forehead. At one point in the evening, it hurt to move my eye . These pains have persisted. I took 800mg of Ibuprofen on Tuesday morning, which took away the sharp pain but there is still a dull pain/feeling of pressure behind and around my left eye and ear. The eye feels dry and sore when I blink. I called a doctor and they felt it could be a migraine. As someone who suffered from migraines in the past, it doesn&#39;t feel like one.

I couldn&#39;t stop crying I was so miserable and had to have my ex boyfriend come take care of me because I didnt have anyone else to, but it got so bad I was strongly considering going to the emergency room...I tried to sleep but my body was so restless. I took ibuprofen and it broke my fever but today I still feel achey and weak. I definitely wasn&#39;t expecting that because the guy that did mine said it&#39;s rare and if they do happen they are mild...I would consider my symptoms higher than mild. There  was nothing else that could caused it..everything was the same and the only different factor was the vaccine so I&#39;m 100% sure that it was the cause.

It was not an option so I wrote it in.  2 weeks after the shot I still have mild pain when breathing in and feel like I am winded more easily to the point that even before the vaccine was in the news I made an appointment with my doctor. He did EKG and D Dimer tests. Both came back normal but I still don?t feel myself.

                                                Approximately 5 hours after the vaccine I developed a very bad headache followed by chills, sweats, congestion, chest pain, body pain, muscle pain, fatigue and fever. The muscle pain and weakness was so bad I would loose balance when walking. I then started to menstruate clots, not my normal cycle timing,  which lasted about 2 days. The clots subsided but I am still bleeding today. I was in bed for 4 days with severe immune response symptoms. After those symptoms subsided the fatigue was so extreme it was hard to function.

                                                I had the normal flu like symptoms about six hours after the vaccine on 4/01/21. They subsided the next morning 4/02. On Saturday night 4/03, I developed a rash on the creases of my arms. I woke up on Sunday 4/04 itching like crazy on my legs. The rash moved around my body throughout the week: back, torso, legs, arms. Everywhere except for my face and feet. It seemed to be hives, as I would have the urge to itch and then the rash would flare up. This went on from 4/03 to about Friday 4/09 and then it subsided. I was advised by a GP to take Zyrtec twice a day and could use a topical steroid until the rash subsided and to avoid an oral steroid. I have had a handful of rashes throughout my adult life so I could tell this one did not look very serious. Like the standard rash, I was so itchy at night. It felt like my skin was crawling.  I suspect it was my body&#39;s delayed reaction to the vaccine shot.

                                                I was given the vaccine at 11:10am and by 5:30pm I was beginning to feel tired and unwell. At 6:45 I had a fever, body aches, pain in my arm, headache, and chest pain. These symptoms continued for three days and my fever reached 102.7.  After three days the fever and body aches subsided but the fatigue and chest pain continued. The chest pain has continued with increased heart rate during small bursts of activity. I called the clinic that administered my shot on April 9th and was told chest pain was normal up to 10 days and if it continued to be a problem to go to the ER. After 11 days of chest pain I went to the ER on April 13th and they did an EKG, CT with contrast, and blood work. They concluded I was fine. I was told it could be esophagitis so to take 2 15mg Prevacid a day which I have done with no relief. I was also informed it could be muscle related so I have iced, taken anti-inflammatory medication, and have not exerted myself.  It is now April 19th and I am still experiencing chest pain and racing heart rate with minimal exertion.

Scheduled appointment.   4/14/21 cont. Seen in office by PA for: 1. Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses. - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT; Future   2. Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3. Family history of DVT - see #1 4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.  (Per provider result notes.)  4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.  Following the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.     She has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.  No abdominal pain.  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.   Patient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.  Advised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.    4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine. An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE. She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days. She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot. She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago. The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.   Today, patient presents states he feels &#34;a lot better&#34;. Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved. She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter; she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this. She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.    She was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75. Today her blood pressure is 122/78.   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved; she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds. She denies pain or swelling of the arm. She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone. She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla. She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.    Her mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved. She denies worsening or severe headache; denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.   Phone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr. After review of patient&#39;s history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily. They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week. They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.   I did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice. They had just left this morning for another state by car. I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not. She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended.

Since then I have had incredible headaches almost daily, lasting a few hours (I have been taking Tylenol for the headaches).  Usually headaches are after 5pm, I will feel dizzy, foggy, and intense pressure, some blurred vision. I do not have a history of migraines or headaches, I have been taking the Tylenol, drinking lots of water, and taking baths to try and help with them.

At 9:40 PM that evening, I started feeling feverish, pain, itching at the injection site (continued for about 6 days); muscles aches (ongoing) headache, nausea, and uncontrollable chills. And I was not able to do anything the next day and that was the 11th. I l also got my period that day. The 12th, my period became a geyser - I never had a period like that before - I was bleeding a lot for about 5 days (my period didn&#39;t last longer than  a normal  period though) ; and I still had some muscle aches (they continued through the 12th). So I gave my PCP a call and went in, and she told me to watch it (she didn&#39;t know I had been vaccinated. I&#39;ve had an ongoing headache this week: on Wednesday (the 21st) - for 22 hours non-stop and Thursday (the 22nd I had another one on Thursday - it was about 6 or 7 hours).

                                                patient was treated with the Janssen/Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 adenovirus vaccine on Saturday April 10, 2021 and she relates having had symptomatic problems since that time stating prior to administration of the vaccine she was in her normal state of health.  She relates that on the evening of April 10 she had chills but otherwise no other major symptoms and the next day felt fine as well as during that week.  However she states that starting 1 week later on Saturday, April 17 she began feeling poorly characterized by a recurrence of hives that she has had in the past along with a sore throat.  She states this occurred while she was at work and describes the sore throat as unusual from prior sore throat she has had in the past with a description of a globus-like sensation along with some difficulties swallowing for more pressure than overt pain.  She attempted salt water gargles without benefit.  The rash was the characteristic hives rash that she has had on 2 prior occasions with rapid development of itchy red lesions scattered throughout especially in her proximal extremities and torso region.  She relates the hives worsened on Sunday, April 18 essentially from &#34;head to toe&#34; although not actually involving her face.  She also related new accompanying symptoms including diffuse arthralgias, stiffness and swollen painful muscles and joints.  This was throughout her entire body and somewhat of a migratory nature involving all of her major joints including the hands, wrists, shoulders, feet, ankles, knees and hips.  She states that because of the severity of symptoms she had an urgent care appointment on Sunday, April 18 and felt to have a exacerbation of urticaria for which she was prescribed montelukast, loratadine cimetidine and a Solu-Medrol Dosepak.  She states she was unable to fill the Solu-Medrol Dosepak initially but took the other medications without relief and then presented to the emergency room here at Hospital on Monday, April 19 where she had an evaluation which was largely unremarkable other than laboratory testing with a nonspecific elevation in inflammatory markers including a CRP of 5.7, ESR 34 and white blood count 15.92.  She was notably COVID-19 negative at that time as well as Monospot negative.  She was discharged home and ended up filling the Solu-Medrol Dosepak which she took and noted some improvement in her hives but has been continue to experience this ongoing sore throat, arthralgias, myalgias and diffuse swelling which is quite painful.  She specifically relates &#34;every time I use a muscle it seems to inflame.&#34;

                                                During my menstrual cycle I usually have no symptoms other than tender breasts. So these symptoms were very unusual. Leg pains, pain and pressure in pelvis, clitoral pain, pain around vaginal opening, stinging like acid during urination that sent a shock through my entire body, uncontrollable bladder, nausea, large blood clots, lower stomach pain, flank pain, hot/cold chills, if I touch my belly button the pain radiated to my vagina, ovaries hurt, cervix pain, dryness, unable to get comfortable, crawling out of my skin, and constant urge to urinate, depression.  I landed myself in the ER where they told me to take Tylenol and Motrin and sent me on my way. These medications were not able to control the amount of pain I was in. I have now reached out to a couple specialists.

                                                4 days after the vaccine I started having periodic sharp pains in my uterus which made me think my period was coming. 6 days post vaccine I started bleeding lightly and the periodic sharp pains continued. 8 days post vaccine I woke up in the most excruciating pain of my life. It was the most severe menstrual type cramps I have ever experienced. I also had a severe headache which I never get. I took 600mg of ibuprofen. The pain continued for hours and I tried my best to breath through it. When I went to the restroom there was only a little blood but large amounts of fleshy tissue began discharging from me. Later that day when the tissue seemed to slow down the pain began to subside to a tolerable threshold (although still more severe than normal). I then began to bleed heavier than any other previous cycle. Normally I have a medium bleed for 2.5 days. This heavy bleeding lasted 6 days. I felt extremely dizzy and weak. Finally when the bleeding stopped I started to feel myself regain strength over the next few days although the sharp intermittent jabs of pain in my uterus lasted about three days after the bleeding stopped. I now am feeling back to normal and recovered. I never went to the ER but came very close to going during that time.

Body began to ache to the point I was in tears. Checked fever again and was at 99.9. Took more Tylenol and Ibuprophen and went to bed as much as I could. Woke up and took Tylenol the next morning. Checked temperature because I still had a pounding headache and was at 100.2, started sweating and shaking as in cold sweats. No appetite. Spent most of the day resting with most symptoms still accruing. On 3rd day I have no fever. I?m not as weak and I?m able to get around a lot better. Still a little nauseous but definitely feeling better then the previous days.

                                                My Rheumatologist suggested I report this:: I had no side effects other than a sore arm and some tiredness up until approx 6 hours after the injection. At approx 8:30 PM, I was lying in bed and both of my legs from the hips down started to shake violently. It did not feel like the chills as I was not cold and the rest of my body was unaffected. The shakes felt completely involuntary as if my brain was short circuiting. My legs shook so violently that my hip joints began to really hurt. Shaking lasted less than 30 minutes total. I am not sure what stopped the shaking, but I had tried to put my body weight over my legs  (body folded in half) to try to stop the shaking and took 1 regular strength tylenol.  After the shaking ended, up until I went to sleep (maybe 3-4 hours later) I felt some numbness and tingling in my finger tips and feet.  The next day, I felt fine but emailed my Rheumatologist to report the shaking and she directed me to report it here.

Intense started in early evening in upper arms and neck and spread through entire body.  Felt as if bones hurt.  In bed 10 hours but got little rest.  Chills and sweats.  Note that the pain is the exact same I had when I had COVID several months ago, which has flared up on and off since.  Next day symptoms are mostly gone, some tiredness and soreness remains.

                                                About 6 hours after injection, I felt incredibly exhausted. After 12 hours, nausea and headache set in. 13-14 hours, a terrible stomachache and diarrhea. My skin felt so sensitive that it hurt to touch. Zofran treated the nausea. The day after the injection I was exhausted, was nauseous and had a headache. 48 hours after injection I woke up with a strange headache. I could look to the right pain free, but if I looked to the left or left/up, I had a piercing pain near my right eye. Excedrin/Tylenol did not relieve this headache. On Hour 72, the headache is still present, though to a lesser degree.

I refrained from Tylenol until about 7pm, I had 1000mg. I slept for 8 hours and woke up with no fever but the muscle aches have reduced by about 50%.

I was shivering and felt unable to get warm despite truck temperature at 90 degrees along with a blanket and seat warmers on. Took 1000mg of Tylenol and symptoms mostly resolved with some minor joint pain and fatigue but had to continue the tylenol every 8-10 hours for the next 2 days or the symptoms returned in the severe state. Site of injection has also been swore with touch still at day 9. No redness or swelling at injection site. Also had 2xepisodes of random severe fatigue which is not normal and it lasted about 1-2 hours.

Was able to sleep until about 3:00 a.m., at which point I woke up to changing temperatures from hot to cold, headache and muscle aches. Most of the aching is occurring in my legs and arms. The back of my thighs are the worst, then my valga, and lastly my biceps and triceps. The headache is mild.

Hard to sleep that night because I was so achy. By the morning I had a fever of 99 (never went higher than that), headache, sore joints and muscles that lasted through the whole day/felt like a mild flu. Waking up on 3/28/21 (day two after shot) my low grade fever was gone and symptoms are mostly gone. Just a slightly sore arm.

Shortly afterwards I developed a warm red bump about the size of a lime (which is still there today). My mother, brother and myself all developed backaches and headaches the next day, but those have passed.   I still have pain at the injection site whenever it is touched.  I called the health department two days after the vaccination and was told that the side effects should only last 24-48 hours, but I still have the redness, lump and soreness.

I have not called a doctor yet, since overall the symptoms are mild to moderate.

First day after felt slightly better, still tired and slightly light headed. Second day symptoms worsened, feeling like I was going to pass out/faint, hot/cold chills, clammy, no fever, shortness of breath, culminating in numbness and tingling in arms, legs, then chest and then hands freezing up which resulted in a panic attack. Have never had a panic attack before. Emergency services called and after checking gave a sedative and went to the ER.

                                                Flu-like symptoms.  Severe chills, nausea, fever, headache, body aches, fatigue throughout the night and into next day. Felt a little nauseous immediately after shot. Flu symptoms came on around 10pm and lasted until about 5pm on 3/21/2021. Worst period of symptoms was overnight (about 12 hours.) Took 2 Tylenol 2-3 times while I was experiencing side effects which helped some with symptoms.  Had pain with injection and sore arm for about 48 hours after. It was a much more severe, deeper muscle pain than with other vaccines.

At the suggestion of a doctor, I took ibuprofen for the muscle pain and ondansetron for the nausea. My body temperature rose from normal to about 101 F within two hours after the onset of muscle pain. After another hour and a half my fever subsided. I continued experiencing strong muscle pain for another twelve hours.

                                                Brain fog approximately one hour post vaccine. Approximately 4 hours after the vaccine, chills started, approximately one hour after chills (5PM) temperature began to rise. After taking temperature, it was 103.8 degrees Fahrenheit. Took tylenol to attempt to lower temperature, however it did not minimize temperature significantly. In addition to the fever, the onset of intense migraine and severe dizziness occured. Took a second dose of tylenol and the temperature did not reduce- and raised to 104.9 degrees fahrenheit. I was unable to sleep the night the vaccine was administered as my head was throbbing and spinning so intensely. I may have had an increased  heart rate- which likely prevented my body from being able to settle, despite other side effects. I also had loss of appetite due to fever, and was able to eat normally until approximately 2 days after the vaccine. The fever broke approximately 24 hours later, however fatigue set in afterwards and lasted through the following week (felt mostly normal the Thursday after receiving the shot 3/18/2021).

                                                My shot was around 12 noon. I didn&#39;t eat before so they gave me crackers and juice at the site. Afterwards I ate a real meal and two hours later I got dizzy. It was tolerable.  At 9:30 PM I got a fever. Then I felt pressure all over my body, pressing me down; I felt so heavy I could barely move. That&#39;s when my joints started to ache and I had piercing pain in my right knee and the bones in both hands. Then I got really dehydrated. No matter how much water I drank, it wasn&#39;t enough. Then I got chills, then a headache. It felt like I had sold my soul to Satan and he was sucking it out through my limbs, very slowly. I thought I might be an anomaly that died from a bad reaction. I tried to sleep so I wouldn&#39;t feel the pain anymore. That attempt took 3 hrs. The next day my migraine and joint soreness persisted. I felt so weak I didn&#39;t get up for hours. Thr second night I still felt unquenchingly dehydrated. Third day I only felt soreness in my arm from the actual shot.

My body felt very hot but I was still cold. Went to bed without taking any pain relief. I woke up at 2 AM, took Tylenol and went back to sleep. I woke up again at 3 AM, felt very hot and turned on my fan. When I woke up in the morning at 7:30 AM, my body still aches and I still had a headache. I took more Tylenol. Headache went away but for the rest of the day I felt very lethargic, a little foggy in my brain, slightly achy. I took Tylenol again when I went to bed at 9 PM and when I woke up at 4 AM the next morning I felt better. All symptoms are gone.

                                                Fatigue that increased, muscle and body aches, starting at the vaccine site then radiating through my shoulder and back, fever, chills, and severe body aches around 11 hours after receiving the vaccine. I took ibuprofen, which didn?t have much effect, followed by Tylenol 3, which relieved the pain enough that I fell asleep. By morning (7am) the fever had dispersed along with the other symptoms apart from soreness around the injection site.

My fiancé experienced extreme muscle cramps to the point that he could not walk, similar symptoms to myself extreme fatigue, metallic taste, floating/fuzzies. Our symptoms began in less than an hour after receiving the vaccine. My fuzziness and neurological symptoms began in the 15 minute observation window. My fiancé is began approximately 40 minutes later. We proceeded to go home eat something small, and sleep for the next 26 hours straight

The dizziness got progressively worse (so much so I had to call into work) with the worst dizziness peaked about 18 hours post vaccine. All symptoms resolved within 36 hours post vaccine. The dizziness felt different than my chronic migraine dizziness. I was more disoriented and it was difficult to stand or walk long distances. I had to lay flat most of the day until symptoms resolved.

Around 2am on 4/12/2021 I was bleeding a lot &amp; at 7am I went to the ER and they confirmed I had a miscarriage. I was 11 weeks pregnant. My estimated delivery date was 10/28/2021. On my previous appointments they said everything was going good with my pregnancy the only complication was hyperthyroidism which I had been taking medication for.

I went to the doctor the next morning as soon as possible and was given an EKG. The EKG came back normal, as did my blood pressure, but my doctor put me on a cardiac event monitor a few days later for two weeks to continue monitoring my heart. I had ongoing symptoms and went to the ER a few days later and had another EKG, blood tests, and a chest x-ray done, all of which came back clear. However, I am still wearing the heart monitor and will follow up with my doctor in a week when it is removed and the results come back to see if there is a reason for the tachycardia.

                                                approximately 5-6 hours after vaccination I developed a severe migraine that was unresponsive to tylenol and ibuprofen.  I had chills, body aches, and general malaise. The migaine remained severe throughout that night until around 5 AM the next morning when I took Tramadol which finally relieved the migraine which then became only a mild to moderate headache. I stayed on the tramadol for another 24 hours which during this time my additional symptoms were improving. By Monday morning (approximately 36 hours after receiving the vaccine) my clinical signs were almost completely resolved. After this there was only a mild headach and lethargy for an additional few days.

                                                Yesterday at 11am I began to experience severe, high (under rib cage) abdominal cramping and a headache. I fell asleep at approx 1pm and woke up around 4pm with less cramping and a dull headache. The headache continued throughout the evening. I had diarrhea on and off. Each time I stood up I felt faint and lethargic, leading me to spend the rest of the night in bed. Today, my body feels sore and lethargic and my mind feels foggy and tired.

However, 5 days after vaccination I awoke with dizziness and fatigue. The dizziness was strong enough that I was unable to work and spent the day sleeping. I contacted my doctor and went in for a visit the next Day. No cause for the dizziness and fatigue was determined, but up one further reflection it is possible that it was a vaccine side effect which is why I?m reporting it here. The dizziness and fatigue was better the next day and completely gone two days later.

She went to Dr. to have a physical since she was feeling so bad.  They did blood work and everything came out fine.

All of her symptoms have subsided excluding her rash.

This was followed by headache, nausea, joint and muscle aches, and shaking from the chills.  I had difficulty sleeping overnight and the next morning, I had a fever of 101-degrees and was still very fatigued.  The symptoms all went away within 24 hours.

The last one (no taste/smell), is the most unusual, I&#39;v never had this before.

Instead of beginning to wane, my period started to get extremely heavy and I started passing clots again about 24hr after the injection. On the night of 4/12 I passed an unusually large clot, roughly the size of a hockey puck and felt very faint and weak. I continued to bleed quite heavily until this morning (4/19), for a total of 14 days. I called my obgyn on Tuesday of last week to report the excessive bleeding and that my cervical lymph nodes had become so swollen that it was bothersome to swallow. My Dr said to go to ER if I experienced typical blood clot/PE symptoms and had received no guidance about the effects of this vaccine on menstruation.  I have had mild headaches, sore throat, mild fevers and fatigue as well since the injection

I refused further medical care because I felt better once the ambulance arrived. I visited my primary care doctor on 4/13/2021 to follow up.  He said it was likely an occular migraine.  A blood test was ordered and results came back as essentially normal.  I have been continuing to have dizzy spells, headaches, blurry vision and light sensitivity. An MRI of my  brain and spinal cord has been ordered for 4/29 to rule out other conditions.

                                                I received the vaccine at about 9:30 AM. From about 8:00 pm - 8:45 pm I experienced a pattern of 30-90 seconds of normal vision, then 1-2 seconds of only being able to see light/colors/shapes (I had lasik in 2016, my prescription was -4.75, the 1-2 seconds of bad vision I experienced was like when I removed my glasses before having lasik correct my vision). This pattern of 30-90 seconds normal vision then 1-2 seconds of bad vision repeated for about 45 minutes. During this time I was also very dizzy and lightheaded.   My other side effects were as expected (fever of up to 102, chills, VERY sweaty, did not have energy to remove my sweatshirt when I was hot, headache).  I am only reporting this in case it is important/helpful for further studies/development of the vaccine and public health.

                                                Within about 2 hours, I felt really tired. A couple hours later I got body aches and tingling sensation on the left leg.  That night it got worse, hurt and some numbness. The following day I had abdominal pain and still had leg symptoms. On Saturday I needed up going to Urgent Care .  They did a Urine test, that was negative, but did see traces of blood but she wasn&#39;t concerned and did I send it our for a culture test. She sis an exam and a little concern because she wasn&#39;t aware of the side effects and ordered an ultra sound. She told me to take Tylenol and sent me home. I was still experiencing all everything the next day and developed a headache. The Urgent care Dr had called me the next day asked me to go in and get the Ultra sound.  They didn&#39;t find anything. I did have another ultra sound scheduled and had it done, I got the results and it was fine. She thinks the vaccine effected my nerves.  I also seen my Primary Physician because I had a fever as well, she did an exam and ordered Blood work and CT scan (abdomen). Everything came back normal.  My OCO believes it&#39;s my nerves as well. I believe it effected my mensural   cycle as well because it&#39;s earlier and heavier.

Headache for 3 days (above right eye, caused some vision changes), then sore throat, cough, brain fog, difficulty sleeping, along with body aches continuing.  Currently on day 13 and still have sore throat, coughing, brain fog, difficulty sleeping, muscle aches, congestion.  Also on day 3, eczema has been building on my face/neck.  Eczema has continued to get worse each day.  when I got the shot, I communicated to the nurse, I was maybe pregnant.  it was too soon to test.  That was Friday.

Monday: Fever (100.5), chills, body aches all over, heart racing, fatigued (did nothing all day but sleep) 2. Monday around 8PM: fever &amp; chills gone, body aches still there all over my body, headache,  fatigue 3. Tuesday: Body aches still bad all over and headache 4. Wednesday: Body ache a little better and headache, tingling/nubmness starts in both legs (faintly) 5. Thursday: body ache barely there, soreness in arm at injection site, tingling/numbness in legs (sharp pain) 6. Friday: tingling/numbness in legs - mainly back of my thighs - sometimes also feeling this tingling  in my arms and upper back area 7. Saturday: same, tingling/numbness in legs/sometimes in arms/upper back, body still sore to the touch 8. Sunday: same, tingling/numbness in legs - sometimes also in arms and upper back, body still sore to the touch 9. Monday: same, same, tingling/numbness in legs - sometimes also in arms and upper back ? Called DR to speak with nurse about this as didn&#39;t feel normal to have this reaction, went into dr for appt on Tuesday, April 20. 10. Tuesday: Saw Dr.  at 7:30am about tingling/numbness in legs - sometimes also in arms and upper back. Possible reaction to vaccine or more? Took labs/blood work: Vitamin B-12 (82607), Folic Acid Serum (82746), CBC / Platelets &amp; Aut Diff (85025), TSH (Tyroid Timulating hormone) (84443), Metabolic Panel (80053), Quest blood draw (36415), Sed rate erythrocyte (85651) - ALL came back normal. 11. Wednesday: same, tingling/numbness in legs - sometimes also in arms and upper back, but the tingling this day got a little less intense. Not as painful today. 12. Had follow-up appt on Thursday, April 22 - took more tests. Tingling/numbness in legs but felt like Wednesday as a little less painful - didnt feel it as much in arms/back. Felt more like when your hand falls asleep and blood comes rushing back into it, thats how my legs felt this day, so more soreness than pain. 11. Friday: Symptoms same as the past 1 days, feel like tingling is getting a tad better.

He reported that she had developed a severe headache and vomited.  She c/o leg and chest pain as well and he reports that she has a history of blood clots but no h/o migraine headaches.  At the time of the call his wife was feeling fine.  I advised that they discuss with PCP. Having none I advised that she discuss with Urgent Care.  I called him back about 6 hours later.  They had decided that since since she continued asymptomatic they were not going to seek clinical evaluation.  They believe that the symptoms were musculo-skeletal after &#34;spending the whole weekend laying a patio&#34;.

It has been weeks and it is still very sore and a little swollen, which is right above where I received the injection. It is causing my shoulder to lock up, I cannot move it in certain direction or lift items at times. I have taken ibuprofen every day since then. I finally went to the doctor and they has me taking  2400 mg of prescription ibuprofen and on flexeril muscle relaxers for 2 weeks to see if I get any relief.

Felt almost good as new.  3/22 I started having trouble breathing, almost like I couldn&#39;t fully breath in and that lasted pretty much until 4/23/2021. It felt like my chest was clogged, like your nose is clogged. Very uncomfortable. I started with a &#39;cough&#39;, almost like I wanted to cough but I kept it all in.  3/23, or 3/25 Urgent Care telemedicine due to being respiratory. Was prescribed an inhaler with albuterol with steroids. Neither seemed to have an affect. The following week, I took a COVID test; Neg. I went back to urgent care, said my lungs were all clear. Prescribed me &#39;oral medication&#39; and expectorant with codeine. Didn&#39;t have affect until I took the expectorant with the codeine.

It wasn&#39;t especially severe and I figured it would go away.  It did. -- At 10 PM, just after dinner, I noticed my heart was racing, but I also felt tired at the same time.  Both hands were kind of numb feeling, but I&#39;d been laying on the right: I figured it&#39;d go away.  It didn&#39;t.  Heart racing and fatigue continued but right hand was noticeably pins &amp; needles.  Took a very hot shower around 11 PM and felt better, but right hand continues to be &#39;cold.&#39; -- Reporting this because I&#39;d never heard of any neurological(?) effects.  Probably just vaccine doing its thing and interacting with my slightly odd biochemistry.  Hopefully will be better in the morning!  ~ Also, an older member of the household received same lot of vaccine at same time: 0 side effects.

                                                About 4:30, 6 hours after receiving vaccination I felt nauseated, muscle aches, horrific headache, and weak. By 6:30 I felt like my body was burning up on the inside but had no fever. My muscles in my neck became extremely tight and my ears aches. The injection site is extremely tender and hurts to lift my arm. As of 11 am the next day I have also added diarrhea to the list of symptoms.

                                                At 2:50 am on 3/9/21 (about 7.5 hours after receiving the vaccine), I awoke to  my body shaking intensely.  It felt like a muscle spasm or like electricity was being pulsed through my body. First it would happen in one leg, and then the leg would curl up under my body. Then it would spasm in my chest and my arms would be drawn inward. Then the other leg, or sometime multiple locations at once. I didn&#39;t feel cold at the time. This lasted for 40 minutes total. I took 1000 mg Acetaminophen at  3:00 am.  Then, as the shaking lessened, I became very cold. I put on lots of clothes and laid on a heating pad under my comforter. Sometime later, I became very hot. Throughout the night into the morning, I felt feverish and chilled back and forth. At 6:00 am I took 200 mg Ibuprofen. I then spent the rest of the day with fever, chills, and body aches. Everything was achy and I was very tired. I slept well that night. The next day I was fatigued.

Roughly 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine, she started to feel nauseous, develop crampy abdominal pain, and feel lightheaded. She went home and took a shower and lay down in bed. When she got up she again felt nauseous and dizzy. She threw up a total of 6 times, none of which were bloody. She had several episodes of diarrhea throughout the day. Given her ongoing symptoms she presented to the ED.   On arrival, she was febrile to 39.5C, and tachycardic to 145 with BP 98/56 and SpO2 100% on room air. She was given zofran, 1L NS, and tylenol. On repeat, her BP was 75/35 (though no longer tachycardic). She was written for 2 more liters of NS and then endorsed to medicine. Her BP improved w/ SBP in the 90s-110s with continued myalgias, headaches.

                                                The night of 3/9/21  following the vaccination I had fever, chills, sweating, severe body aches and pains (all over) and nightmares Wednesday morning I was unable to go to work and remained in bed sleeping all but approximately 2 hours in the afternoon  because I was still in pain and had headache/fever/chills/muscle and joint pain. I also had no appetite. I was awake long enough to eat one bowl of cereal and a small apple sauce cup so that I could take more meds without upsetting my stomach. Wednesday night 3/10 my temperature was still at 99.3. I was still having body soreness and headaches (sinus). Thursday morning 3/11 I still had the headache and body soreness but no more fever. I was still feeling unwell but could at least get out of bed and function. By late Thursday most of the symptoms subsided and I started feeling better. Friday morning I was no longer having symptoms.  It was the initial symptoms Tuesday night and Wednesday that concerned me the most because it hit me so severely and fast. The pharmacist warned me of possible side effects that would require over the counter medication, but in my case that did not suffice. I was physically unable to do anything but sleep which is highly unusual for me, and my entire body was in more pain than I?ve ever experienced.

On her vaccination list she stated that she is allergic to many thing including some foods and medication. She stated that her doctor still wants her to receive it due to her condition(immune system disorder). She came with her husband. They had a case with medications in case she experiences reaction. He had Benadryl and EpiPen in his case. First 15 minutes she was feeling fine, on the 25-30 min I asked them how was she doing and husband said she is not feeling very good. we measured her heart rate and it was around 150bpm.  Husband said her lips and tongue  are starting to swell. I asked him if they want me to call 911 but he refused. He preferred to take her home and observe. I called to check on patient few hours ago. He told me she was stable but her tongue is still swollen. I told them to go to ER if the symptoms get worse. He said she is improving and feeling better now

                                                At the time of my vaccine I was 30 weeks pregnant. My expected date of delivery is 5/18/21 and I have had no issues/complications with this pregnancy.   I received my vaccine on 3/9  at 4:00 PM, and stayed to be monitored for  30 minutes due to my pregnancy, After the vaccine, Per the clinics recommendation, I drank lots of fluids the rest of the day. Several hours later I noticed I had a minor headache. I Consulted with my OBGYN and took 650mg of Tylenol before going to bed. By midnight when I layed down(and throughout the remainder of the night - till about 7am) I had moderate body aches - especially in my legs. I also felt feverish with chills and at times sweating, but had no actual fever. I checked on three sperate occasions between 12AM and 7AM. I was unable to sleep that night.   The following day (3/10) I felt tired, had some lingering body aches (though not as bad as the night before) and a minor headache that would come and go throughout the day. I also had minor arm pain at the injection site - nothing different then a flu shot. continued to drink lots of fluids and took  Tyelnol as needed.   When I woke up on 3/11, I felt perfectly fine. No headache, body aches, arm pain, etc.

This rapidly turned into skin tingling, violent shivers and shaking throughout the body followed by burning hot fever. Once this passed, at about 2:00am, nausea began and mild vomiting. After that, exhaustion set in and loss of appetite. The exhaustion and lack of appetite lasted until about 8pm on Saturday - about 28 hours post-vaccine. However, vomiting occurred again at midnight that night as well about 34 hours post-vaccine.

                                                I began to have a small headache about 4 hours after the shot which turned into a bigger full body aches, and tiredness 8 hours after injection. Chills started approximately 10 hrs after injection and lasted for at least 4 hours, followed by sweats which lasted at least another 6 hours. Aches were very painful for ten hours and I took extra strength tylenol twice over the ten hour period. Aches and exhaustion continued, though less painful, for the next  12-18 hours. and were gone after about 36 hours total.  Shoulder at injection site did not hurt initially, but began to hurt about 10 hrs after, and continued to get worse for about 10 hours until finally dissapating in that spot 48 hrs later.  However, the pain at the injection site has moved to the shoulder joint, and adjacent clavical area over the next day or so where it has stayed now 5 days after injection.

                                                started with drowsiness and no appetite, chills came on but nothing serious but within 1 hour the chills became very intense and I couldnt  warm up or take it. I had sweatpants, two sweatshirts, slippers and 2 blankets on to help. Later on I had fallen asleep to wake my husband to uncontrollable laughter and crying, mentally I knew what I was doing was not right but I couldn&#39;t control it. I believe my feve may had spiked so high that it was border line hysteria. By morning I woke and the fever had broke however I still had no appetite, terrible headache along with weakness and fatigue....I also tried food but ended up spitting it out because everything tasted strongly of metal. Sunday I was back to tasting to food and more energy.

By 6:30pm, I was down for the count with the cold sweats, diarrhea, headache and vertigo like symptoms (dizzy when standing or moving). Tylenol was taken for fever and water and Gatorade is all that was drank for the remainder of the night. When awaking around 8am the next morning,  fever was gone as well as chills. headache and dizziness remained. Around 1pm, toast and oatmeal was eaten and started feeling more normal again. by 5pm was fine, just tired and sore still.

Saturday I felt achy and a little unsteady when I got up or walked around (these reactions I expected). Sunday morning I woke up covered head to toe in hives that lasted for three days. I have never had hives so bad before. I called the pharmacy and was instructed to take Benedryl which didn&#39;t work. I took Allegra on Tuesday which seemed to help clear them up by the end of the day.

But then on Monday I noticed a very tender left armpit, and I also have very itchy eyes, something I never have.  I also developed a small purple patch on my leg, and a little skin sore on my left arm.  It looks like more may be developing.

A few minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient walked up to the counter and said she wasn&#39;t feeling well.  When I went over she said she was really lightheaded and was sweating and felt like she was going to faint.  I had her lay on the floor and elevate her feet.  I put an ice pack on her forehead.  She never lost consciousness and felt better after a few minutes. She eventually sat back up and stayed in the waiting area for a while longer to be monitored.  She did state that she felt a cold rush in her chest right before she became lightheaded. She ended up feeling fine and went home.

I went to bed and had difficulty sleeping because I felt so hot. When I woke up the next day, I had a fever of 99.7. I took Tylonol, but still had body aches, chills, a headache, fatigue and some nausea, as well. I slept most of the day, ate bland foods and continued to take Tylonol every 4-5 hours. I began to feel better around 6pm the day after the shot.

I got hot and sweaty and horrible tunnel vision, I almost fainted. I laid down on one of their medical beds to recover while the sweet nurse fanned me.  I was observed over 30 min before leaving.  I woke up yesterday and felt weird along with bodyaches, chills, joint pains, random stinging sensations throughout my body (almost like a pen prick), sporadic short headaches and muscle cramps.  I left work yesterday and didn?t even go in today.

Took an Epsom salt bath at 6:30pm. At 8pm got hit with chills, fever of 100F, entire neck and back started to ache and have pain, mild headache, and both hands and fingers felt weak and had a burning sensation. Took another 500mg Tylenol then laid down and fell asleep around 9pm. Woke up at 11pm drenched in sweat with same symptoms. Changed into dry clothes and woke up again around 3am drenched in sweat again, but fever was gone. Woke up on April 9 feeling lethargic, a tire body was achy and sore and had a headache. Fever never came back and the weakness and burnings ends ruin in hands was gone as were the chills. Throughout the day I rested and had physical therapy to loosen my muscles in my neck and back. By the end of the day I still had a headache and sore back and neck. Woke up on Sunday april 10 and back achy ness is tolerable, headache is still present, but manageable. Took 600 mg Advil in morning.

Prior to going to bed at midnight, I started to experience slight stomach pain. At 2am in the morning (4/11) after receiving the shot I started vomiting and had diarrhea which lasted for about one hour. After returning to bed I had severe chills.   I ate the same foods throughout the day as 3 other adults and 1 child and none experienced similar symptoms.

She has no significant medical history and presented with a headache that became severe 3 days ago.  She received the Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine on March 25th and had a mild headache following that which she attributed to the vaccine.  3 days ago the pain became excruciating and was associated with vomiting.  This prompted presentation to the ED where she was treated with Dilaudid. She was discharged home and has been using her mom&#39;s headache cocktail with some transient relief.  She presented back to the ED today with continued symptoms.  MRV revealed a venous sinus thrombosis and neurology was therefore consulted.   She has no history of clots personally or in the family.  Her dad did have a stroke in his 50s.  Patient otherwise denies any other associated speech change, vision change, extremity numbness, extremity weakness, coordination difficulty, or dizziness. Patient admitted to the neurology ICU and started on anticoagulation.

                                                A few minutes after the injection I felt strange sensations in my arms. About half an hour after the injection started feeling a little dizzy and tightness in chest and throat. Later in the evening I had mild flu like symptoms, chills aches. The following morning was a Sunday and was feeling better but later that day throat started hurting. Throat progressively became swelled and irritated and extremely sore. Flu like symptoms returned. Throat was swelled and to the peak of pain on Monday night. Tuesday morning I was seen at a clinic and it was a little bit better. It started getting better after that but also it has now been a week and a half and throat is still a little bit irritated. I also have brown splotches that appeared on my face either the night of the vaccine or the morning that have not went away.

                                                I experienced tiredness a couple hours after receiving the vaccine. Shortly after, body ache set in. The following morning, I woke up with body ache and developed a headache soon after. The headache lasted all day. It became difficult to focus on anything else. I remember I couldn&#39;t even look at my phone screen because it hurt to do so. At times, I felt like the room was spinning around me. Later that night, I checked my temperature and had a slight fever, but it was only a degree or so higher than my normal temperature. I also experienced some chills throughout the evening. I went to bed early that night and woke up feeling like a brand new person with no remaining symptoms.

Then the muscle aches began which were intensified by the shivering ( very painful for 2&#43; hours, then lessened overbite but still present today).  Joint soreness and pain (especially knees &amp; wrists). Temp of 101.1 for at least 1&#43; hour by the time we checked prior to bed. A few very strong waves of nausea during fever spell, but that has gone away this morning.

                                                On Thursday, April 8, 2021, between 915 and 945 AM, I received the Janssen/Johnson &amp; Johnson single dose COVID-19 Vaccine. As I have had adverse reactions to vaccines in the past, I was advised to wait at the vaccination site for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine, and I did. Approximately 2 hours after receiving the vaccine in my left arm, I developed a red lacey-type rash all over my body. (This rash still persists today, Tuesday, April 13, 2021 at 3:37 PM and is relieved temporarily with consistent doses of Benadryl capsules, liquid or tablets.)  On Thursday night (April 8), after receiving the vaccine, I began to have body aches and to feel fatigued around 7:30 PM. I took 50 mg Benadryl, 500 mg acetaminophen, 800mg ibuprofen and went to bed. I woke around 12:30 AM and was drenched in sweat and my clothes were wet with sweat. I urinated and went back to bed and was shivering uncontrollably from the time I got out of bed until I got back in the bed and bundled up?it was several minutes before the shivering stopped and I went back to sleep. At approximately 2 AM, I woke up to urinate again. I had a terrible headache, like my head was in a vice; my tongue, throat, and nasal passages were very swollen, and it was difficult to breathe through my nose at all. I took an additional 50 mg of Benadryl and a 500mg acetaminophen and went back to bed. On Friday morning I woke to a phone call from work checking on me. I had slept through all of my alarms and it was 8:35 AM. I was unable to report to work that day and went back to sleep and slept for most of the day, only getting up occasionally to get a drink and use the bathroom. That evening I was able to get up and do a few things with the children and run to the grocery store, however, I became very fatigued and went to bed early without eating dinner.  On Saturday morning, when I woke up, I realized that I had slept for over 12 hours. I was groggy and fatigued all day and had a nap in the afternoon. That evening I was able to participate in family movie night and was feeling ok until about 10 PM. At that time, I began to feel very nauseated and had diarrhea, even though I had not eaten anything that would upset my stomach. I had intense abdominal cramping and felt like I would vomit if I moved around too much. I went to bed and had to get up to use the bathroom with diarrhea at least twice after the initial symptoms at about 10 PM.  On Sunday morning, I woke up after sleeping approximately 10 hours and was able to get up without feeling too fatigued. I did chores and errands and began to feel fatigued in the afternoon and took a nap for about 2 hours. That evening I also had to rush to the bathroom with diarrhea, however, there was no nausea. I went to bed at about 10 PM. On Monday morning, when I woke up, I felt very groggy and did not feel like I had gotten enough sleep. By the evening on Monday, however, I had begun to feel a little less fatigued and more clear-headed. As of Tuesday, April 13, 2021, I have had the red lacey-looking rash intermittently since having the vaccine. I am already on several OTC allergy medications for seasonal allergies and continue to take those medications, however, I have increased my Benadryl intake from 25 mg in the morning to 50 mg in the mornings with 25 -50 mg every 6 hours or so, as well. The rash improves for a short time while I am taking the Benadryl, but it reappears within a few hours after taking the Benadryl.

                                                Once my vaccine was administered I felt tingling on my tongue and bottom lip. I waited the 15 minutes and felt that the tingling was diminishing. I spoke to the tech and felt ok to leave since I was not experiencing loss of breath or swelling. After about 3 hours I noticed the tingling sensation coming back. I immediately called the pharmacist who administered the shot. After explaining the tingling was mostly felt on my lips and tongue but had no swelling and could breath and swallow just fine. I explained that it felt like when you get a shot for Dental work and that every time I touched the area it would tingle more. He told me that was not a normal reaction and would call in a few hours to check in on me. Sometime around 7 we spoke again and I still had no changes with the tingling. Again, he said he would have the pharmacist who was in call again the next day to make sure I was ok. By 11:30pm the aches in my joints started and I had chills. I woke up for work at 3:25am and noticed the tingling sensation wasn&#39;t as strong as the day before. Once I ate the tingling became more noticeable and was mostly on the right side of my tongue and throat. I also started experiencing a headache and sinus pressure. After arriving I work by 6am I felt exhausted. As the day went on the exhaustion  was becoming so strong I felt that I was fighting to keep my eyes open. The aches in my joints were becoming more intense especially in my hips and hands. At times I felt it hard to hold anything in my hand as closing my fingers became so painful it brought tears to my eyes. I also notice I was sweating profusely but had no fever. Once I was home I took a 2 hour nap. I woke up feeling the same the tingling in my mouth, aches still noticeable and headache still there. I could not stand and even tried to eat but had a loss of appetite. I called the pharmacy and reported the tingling was still noticeable. The pharmacist on duty explained the aches were normal but the tingling was not. I was advised to seek medical attention if I had trouble breathing or had swelling. The pharmacist told me to keep up on rest and fluids and I would recieve another call tomorrow to see how I was feeling. It&#39;s now 9:28pm and there are no changes to the tingling sensation in my mouth/throat. I still have aches and pains that are radiating throughout my body. My headache is still there but not as strong as this morning and I now have ringing in my ears. Every once in awhile I get some good stomach pains but they last a minute or two before going away.

                                                I got the vaccine at 4pm at the pharmacy where I work. I had no symptoms except for very mild local injection discomfort but was able to do my usual normal activities. At 2 am that evening, I woke up with  a lot of pain in my legs, I felt they were so heavy to move around in bed. My lower back was extremely painful too, I tried to stand up to walk a bit, the pain was very severe and I couldn?t stand straight, it was very hard to drag my feet, they felt very heavy and my muscled were painful to the touch even. So went back to bed, and was in agony. I had to go to work in the morning to open the store I work at until they find me coverage. Driving was very hard with my painful legs. J reached the store and I was walking very slowly, I couldn?t have a full control over my legs, they were painful waist down, and felt very heavy, when I sat down my muscles were painful wherever pressure was applied to them (from the chair).  Lightheadedness: I felt lightheaded when I woke up from bed at night to try to walk and ease the pain. So decided to go back to bed to prevent falls. At work, while walking and sitting, I had episodes of very light headidness and sat often on the floor and lifted my legs. Measured my blood pressure on 3 occasions it was 90/50  then 100/50 then 110/60. One time only I fainted where my colleagues put me down and lifted my legs.  At 8am (morning of 3/9/20201) I had a feeling of  heavy breathing. Needed to take deep breath as if my lung muscles were tired and needed to take deep breath to fill them with enough air. At work and because of the increased intensity of muscles pain, I started to breath faster and deeper coz I was in agony   Headache: severe and excruciating headache started from 6am to 12pm on 3/9/21.   Throughout the symptoms, I refused to take medications to let the vaccine run its course. My family drove me back from work coz I was weak and lightheaded and in severe pain at 10.30am. Came home, took one Advil 200mg at 11am. I was completely pain free  at 12pm. Lungs still felt weak, needed to breath deeper for two days but then got better.

                                                I have a 9 month old daughter. I breastfeed her on a regular basis, every 4-5 hours. Twelve hours after receiving the vaccine along with the usual expected side effects -- fever and chills - I experienced a decrease in milk supply. My daughter was latched on the right breast and then on the left for a total of 15 minutes, there was no let down and no milk was flowing (I was intently listening and she was not swallowing which means no milk was coming out of either breast), let down usually happens after 2 minutes for me. The milk returned the following feeding, about 2 hours later although the let down took longer- about 10 minutes after she was latched on, and there was definitely less milk because my breasts were not full and at this point after 9 hours of no breastfeeding my breasts would have been very full and I would be experiencing some pain because of the fullness. My breastmilk supply is back to normal now.

Extreme bleeding-appeared to be almost double in quantity and horrible cramping-more than I have ever had with a previous period. I?ve had 2 children and minus the time pregnant and breastfeeding each of them I?ve always gotten my period monthly and occasionally it would be a few days late-but never early. I proceeded to have a bad headache that ebbed and flowed for at least 5 out of 7 days of that week. I am now  39 days out from the start of that period and have not had another period yet-which is also strange.

About 3 days ago I started getting a major headache on the right side that also arrived with blurry vision, mental fog and mild dizziness. Nausea yesterday and today except the headache was much worse. I cried from the pain and this is when I became more concerned. My eyes, mainly the right side and a pressure in my sinuses were very difficult to bare with, subsided some with multiple doses of ibuprofen and Advil sinus but not by much. The headache is unbearable, painful to stand out bend over or move.

                                                I did not receive treatment other than a prescription for a headaches.  I ended up having a bad headache after my J&amp;J vaccine. My headache developed at the base of my skull and radiated to the top of my neck. I had another headache above my eye as well. I also had  intense joint pain from my upper leg all the way to my right ankle.  I also experienced nausea along with my headache.  An  ultrasound of the right groin was performed to check any clots in my right leg. The doctor who saw me prescribed Emetrex for the headaches and there has been no follow up since then.  I still have a headache today but is a lot less in intensity.

But then by Tuesday (4/6) of the next week I started feeling pain in my right arm and then sometimes I would get the sensation of it falling asleep.  I havent felt that sensation anymore since Sunday (4/11).  By Friday (4/9) I started feeling pressure in my chest in the mornings.  I have been having these two discomforts till today.  Yesterday was the worst feeling it was morning and then all of a sudden everything went white and I was about to faint then my heart started racing so fast.  I have never experienced any of these symptoms in my life.  I am not a person that gets sick or is sick of something.

                                                4/7/21 I recieved the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine in my left arm. Within 45 minutes of the vaccine I ran a fever that reached 104.2.  I felt weak with chills.  This began the consecutive 7 day cycle of fever, chills, and sweats.  During this time, my fever would range from 101.1 to 103.  After taking two extra strength tylenol it would come down but then go back up before the 6 hour mark to take the next dose.   The chills were the worst of the symptoms as they were full body spasms curling me into the fetal position.   As the Tylenol would kick in, the chills and fever would subside and I would begin to sweat. This was a full body sweat that soaked my clothing and bedding.

                                                On March 13th, 2021 I was given the opportunity to receive the Janssen Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid 19 vaccine so I decided to go ahead and get vaccinated.  Within 1.5 hours of receiving the vaccine, I began to feel unwell. It started with my left leg going numb. From there symptoms continued to increase. I got very tired could hardly stay awake. Then the chills hit. I could not get warm.  By the next morning (Sunday day 2) I had developed a low fever, headache, body aches and whole body weakness. I could still hardly stay awake still. When I was awake, I was very dizzy and I felt like everything around me was moving but I was not. My left leg still felt numb but I thought it would pass on its own.. Because of how I felt, I just laid around and rested. My injection site was swollen, Red and extremely hot to touch.  Next comes Monday (day 3), I got up that morning, still not feeling well. I made my way to work. That did not go well. The more I moved, the worse I felt. I was completely unbalanced and looked like I was drunk. I couldn&#39;t walk straight, I had to randomly grab onto chairs and sit down. I was feeling weaker by the minute. I left work at that point and went to see my primary physician that afternoon. At this point I could see straight to drive myself, could hardly walk as my left leg now dragged. I had no balance and having lots of dizzy spells at this point. He suggested I head to th ER but eventually decided we could wait until morning to see if things improved at all. If no improvement,  I was to go to ER. Tuesday Morning (day 4), my husband took me to the emergency room. I had reached the point of not being able to walk unassisted. At this point, the weakness and numbness I had on my left, had spread to my right side. We had no idea what was happening. We got right in and discussed what was going on. What lead up to me being there, etc. The ER ran blood work, xrays of my chest and 3 different MRIs trying to figure out if something happened like a stroke. NOTHING was present on any test they did yet there was something obviously wrong with me. My arm was still very Red and hot.. I had developed a lump in my arm where the vaccine was given. After ruling out everything the doctor could think of, he consulted with the on call neurologist since it was obvious to him something was happening with my neurological system. The diagnosis...my body was taking the vaccine as a toxin causing my neurological system to react and shut down. They felt that I should be starting feel better in the next few days as the vaccine settles into my system. I was told to follow up with a neurologist and my primary. I was then discharged from the hospital in the condition I had arrived.  Wednesday (day 5) I spent the day at home, not able to do anything. I napped most of the day. I still felt like crap and had no idea when I would start feeling better. No improvement that day.  Thursday (day 6) I woke up feeling a bit better. My right side was beginning to feel normal again but I was still feeling weak and unbalanced. This is also the day I meet with a neurologist to follow up. I don&#39;t know that this appointment had accomplished much as she didn&#39;t have access to all my medical records. She ended up prescribing me a medication to help with nerve pain I was having in my left side and referred me to do physical therapy. I am to follow up in 2 months.  Friday (day 7) my right side is back to pre-vaccine stage. My left is not. I feel pretty good except the occasional dizzy spell and the fact my left isn&#39;t working yet.  Day 8 and beyond...I&#39;m feeling ok. I went back to work but still have issues with my left side and residual dizzy spells. I began physical therapy 2 days a week to work on strengthening my left side however it has yet to help.  I am now just over 4 weeks post covid vaccine. I am now using a cane to help me walk as my left side has still not returned to normal. It is unknown if it will. I&#39;m in Physical therapy 2x a week still. The lump at injection site is now the size of a pea. I still have moments of unbalanced feeling and dizzy spells.

                                                I started getting fatigued and achy around 5 pm. By 6 pm I started to feel chilled and a fever began to form. By 6:30 or so I was shaking intensely and my fever was climbing quickly. By 8 pm I had a fever of 102.7 F. I took two Advil around 7 pm. My fever stayed that high for less than an hour, but it stayed at around 101.5 throughout the night. When I wok up at 6:30 it was still over 101. It took until early afternoon to go all the way back down to my normal temperature of 97.6 (that has been my normal temperature throughout the pandemic). I had a pounding headache throughout the night (with a fever) and for most of the next day. Today, on the 3/8, I will have some joint and muscle achiness. The most intense aching was in my hips and low back. FYI, I am marking that I have recovered from my adverse reaction in the field below because I am considering the high fever and intense headache and bod aches to have been the adverse reaction. My mild aching right now would not have been worth reporting.

Symptoms became under control after 50mg of Benadryl. Thick mucus lingered until the next day. Increased heart rate leveled off after Benadryl took affect. Fully recovered by the following day.

                                                I had the expected side effects of fever and chills that evening around 8pm on the evening of the vaccine (3/13/21) and it went away by 1am. The next morning (3/14) I felt a bit tired but still had enough energy to go on my usual 8-mile run.  Just when I thought the side effects had passed, I was woken up that night by chest tightness and shortness of breath. I had to go to the ER on the evening of 3/14/21and got discharged around 2am of 3/15/21. They did and EKG and they said my heart and lungs are all in great shape and that this is probably just a vaccine side effect. They said they see it more often in Moderna but I guess it can happen with this one too. I just hope I?m not one of the rare cases that ends up in death.  I do have a history of allergies and asthma. I?m feeling better though, though I still feel something different in my chest.

I had chills, body aches, fever, elevated heart rate,  heat flashes, and headache throughout the whole night. I could not sleep due to anxiety, which I don?t have normally. It was beyond miserable. It lasted a little over 48 hours. None of the symptoms were mild.

I drifted off to sleep all right around 10:30, but by midnight, my legs were on fire like I?d just run a marathon. I?m pretty sure I had a fever because I was sweating and tossing and turning for what seemed like hours. By 4:00, I had a massive headache and felt like I was going to throw up. I took Advil and Zofran at 4 and went back to bed. Sunday I still battled headache, aches, and fatigue. The fatigue is what&#39;s still lingering yesterday and today.

I started getting very cold and shaking around 10:00 PM. My finger nails and lips started getting pale and my temperature started rising. The shaking stopped around 12:15 AM, but my fever continued as high as 101.4 throughout the night and into the morning. I continued taking Tylenol and the fever went away the morning of 3/12/21, but slight chills returned around noon that did not last long. I took more Tylenol that evening for a headache and noticed I had an on and off throbbing pain in my right ear.

Fever was between 100-102 for about 48 hours from symptom onset, and had significant joint pain in all joints, but especially knees. Major fatigue but unable to sleep because of intensity and discomfort of symptoms. Outbreak of new aphthous ulcers in mouth. Contacted physician to ask if I could take acetaminophen or ibuprofen to lower fever and get relief from joint pain - was advised both were safe to use. Took acetaminophen. Major symptoms resolved after 48 hours, but some general fatigue, loss of appetite, and night sweats continued for approximately 1 week post-vaccine.

Monday March 29 my  bottom lip started swelling at 1:45 pm and by 2:30 pm both eyes were swollen. I had tremendous pain behind my left eye which caused me to go to the Emergency room. I was given IV meds and had prescriptions ons waiting for me at the pharmacy the next day. My eyes were still swollen the following Tuesday the 30th. I am on a steroid and to antihistamines to help prevent this from happening again along with Benadryl, ibuprofen for pain.

I put an ice pack on my head because it feels swollen and there?s a lot of pressure that it?s painful. This morning I tried to eat crackers so I could take ibuprofen but I threw up immediately. I?m currently still experiencing a lot of head pain/ache and nausea and muscle tightness.

                                                04/02/21 12:45 pm ? At approximately 12:45 pm I was called to vaccine tent #1 after reports from staff that a patient was feeling sick after receiving her Janssen injection. I discovered the patient slumped in her chair, head back with eyes closed, skin clammy and cool. Alert and oriented x3, speaking slowly but clearly. Per vaccine nurse, she administered the Janssen injection to patient at 12:41 pm  (Lot 1805020, exp 5/25/2021, Left Deltoid) and a few minutes later the patient started to close her eyes and leaned back in chair requiring assistance to sit up.  Nurse was able to stabilize patient in chair and then called for help and that is when I came to assist. Patient remained in this state for several more minutes. Activated EMS for further evaluation as patient did not stabilize immediately. Measured vital signs ? Blood Pressure 98/62, O2SAT 97, Pulse 68.  I continued to monitor the patient until EMS arrived. EMS evaluated patient and cleared but advised to continue to monitor for an additional 15 minutes before leaving the site. Patient verbalized understanding and agreed with plan. Patient remained in observation for an additional 15 minutes with no incident.

Had about a  2 second warning that I was going to faint. I felt perfectly fine prior to fainting.  After fainting where I was unconscious for 15 seconds, I was dizzy.  Today (4/4/21) - I am very tired and weak and have lower neck pain due to fall.

My arm was immediately tingly and numb simultaneously, and I felt...light and weird. Around 2p, I began feeling feeling lightheaded and weak, and at 6p, I had chills, severe weakness, dizziness and nausea. I couldn&#39;t stand up longer than 2 minutes without wanting to vomit and faint. I couldn&#39;t even stand up long enough to wash dishes, prepare a bowl of grapes to eat or shower. Throughout the night, I sweated so terribly from the chills to the point that my bed was soaked to the mattress pad, and currently at 2:02p on April 6th, I&#39;m still experiencing the extreme weakness, nausea, and chills.

                                                Approximately 9 hours after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA, I experienced sudden fatigue followed by onset of severe muscle and joint pain including severe head pain followed by severe chills followed by fever and excessive sweating. I was very dizzy and felt disoriented. I was in bed when all this happened and was already wearing warm clothes under the covers. The muscle and joint pain was so severe, I couldn&#39;t grip anything including my cell phone (my wrists were in sharp pain). The head pain was so severe I was sensitive to light regardless of how dim it was. I felt like my toes were curled, but that could have been me &#34;bracing&#34; and tightening up due to the total body pain. I could move very little. It was very strange. These symptoms persisted through the night. The following morning at around 9am, I still had a very bad headache that made me nauseated and continued to be sensitive to light. Some of the joint and muscle pain tapered down enough for me to get out of bed to go potty but it was exhausting to walk 5 feet to the bathroom and then get back in bed. I still ran a mild fever. At around 1pm I took a Tylenol that helped subside the symptoms but felt wiped out all day. By the following day (Monday), I was feeling better getting more energy and by that Monday evening, I felt like nothing ever happened. I&#39;m sure these just fall into perhaps the more severe level of the side effects, but I was frightened by the intense sharp muscle and joint pain to the point I couldn&#39;t even grip anything.

I was puking and had diarrhea  over and over for a few hours. I also felt lightheaded and dizzy and weak. Also had the headache. I was getting chills as well once I got home.

About 10 minutes after the shot, she came back to the pharmacy and reported she was not feeling right.  She was extremely tired, weak, and dizzy.  She was told to sit down for further observation and given a bottle of water.  About 5 minutes later, she said she was still feeling really bad.  She said she was not thinking clearly and didn&#39;t feel right. She was also experiencing moderate pain down her spine.  She said her thinking was so affected that she wanted to seek treatment.   Patient declined offer to call EMS, and proceeded to an urgent care clinic next door.  Urgent care later called the pharmacy to inform us that patient had been transported to the hospital by ambulance.

                                                I felt fine for nearly 12 hours after the jab and was on a walk when very suddenly had severe chills and felt poorly and wasn&#39;t sure I could get home. I felt a little nauseous, and my gut was upset. I had chills, fever, and then began to have painful muscle aches on my backside. My sleep was significantly disrupted - I woke up at midnight two nights in a row after my fever broke, then had disrupted sleep the whole rest of the night, waking up at least once an hour, the second night in significant pain from muscle aches. I didn&#39;t feel well enough to get out of bed for about 40 hours, would get chills if I got up for more than a couple minutes. I began to feel better second morning after symptoms began, took two Tylenol, then improved  rapidly  with no further side effects.

Because it would make me more nauseated.  Terrible headache I fell asleep earlier in the afternoon I had to hold my Stomach and even turning in bed led to more nausea.  Finally fell asleep  dor the night woke up so far today I don?t feel nauseated I do feel dehydrated and I tried to drink Gatorade but drinking  from a cup aggravates it so only like ice chips or popsicles don?t aggravate my stomach    I felt like I was dying just laying on the floor for hours I laid on the. Ahg room floor because the tile was cool and I was near the toilet.  I tested positive for covid asymptomatic in October and then positive again in December with mild symptoms.  I never fully regained sense of smell or taste only partially even though that was months ago.  I wouldn?t wish that vaccine reaction in anyone   I was hesitant sins with already had covid to get vaccinated but was encouraged to do so.  I definitely won?t do that again ever.  It wasn?t that bad actually having COVID that was way worse.

                                                As the vaccine was being administered into my left deltoid, the vaccine hurt at the injection site and I immediately felt very strange and felt a rushing sensation to my head and throughout my body, with a concentration in my upper body.  It felt like an out of body experience: I fainted, hitting my head on the adjacent wall and fell to the ground, where the impact caused a bruise to my shoulder and back.  It was reported to me that I lost consciousness for about 10 seconds.  I felt disoriented, but lucid when I came to.  I was not exactly sure what happened, but I could feel that I hit my head on the right side and asked if I fainted since I was disoriented and on the floor.  With assistance, I was able to sit back on the bench, but felt extremely dizzy, light headed, fuzzy/strange type of blurry vision, and intense sweating.  I did not feel well and knew I would have an unsteady gait if I attempted to stand.  After about 15 minutes, I felt well enough to return home.

                                                Later in the evening after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine, I developed a 103 degree fever, severe chills, headache, fatigue, and mild nausea/upset stomach.  I tried to hold off for a bit from taking any pain relievers, but did take tylenol about halfway through the night which helped quite a bit. The next day I only had a low grade fever, fatigue and minor stomach upset. I also had some arm pain starting that evening post vaccination and it lasted for about 5 days. I felt mostly fine though within a couple days. I am one week post vaccination and currently feel pretty good. I have been sleeping heavier/more this week but I&#39;m not sure whether it&#39;s related or not.

I contacted my OB and was told to do another set of kick counts.  At 11:00PM I did another kick count and she still wasn&#39;t moving. I went into my  OB&#39;s office for tests and observation. I had a fever, body aches and chills. I was given Tylenol and fluids and was observed. After the initial dose, her heart rate was back to normal. I was sent home and continued Tylenol and fluids and eventually my heart rate and blood pressure returned to normal. My estimated date of delivery is 05/02/2021 but I&#39;m having an induction on 04/28/2021.

At 6:30pm I began to have uterine/abdominal cramping, vaginal pain, lower back pain. At 7:30 I began to feel extremely overheated and a little fatigued. At 9:00pm I felt chills, extreme fatigue, all over body ache and joint pain. At about 2:00 am overnight I again felt extremely overheated. The following morning I continued to feel fatigue, abnormal temperature swings, body ache and joint pain. This lasted until night (about 30/36 hours after the injection). About 48 hours after the injection, I felt some dizziness and abdominal upset.

(not sure if this is still there) Did not miss work due to these side effects.

                                                Within 5 minutes I started to have flank pain on the rightside. Was having a panic attack so couldn&#39;t breathe well. Flank pain started spreading to my side and mid to lower back. Then it started in the left side. Then it went across my whole mid back and got extremely stiff. Part of my top lip is numb. Over 4 hours and I still can&#39;t breathe properly despite the use of my anti anxiety medicine hours ago. Neck pain. Legs walking in slow motion no matter how hard I tried to push them. Hyperventilating after coughing 2 or 3 separate times. Shooting pain in my back when I lay down. Can&#39;t catch my breath laying down.

                                                After I got the vaccine my heart rate went over 100 and I had to lay down at the hospital to recover because I was so dizzy. On Saturday night and Sunday I felt some normal side effects like a severe headache, chills, nausea, and fatigue. Monday I felt better than normal and I thought I was in the all clear. Today (Tuesday) I woke up feeling like I had a stroke. I can still lift both arms and both sides of my face, but I can not think and feel like I am dying. I am scared to go to the hospital. I am unable to work. I feel incredibly emotional and unable to think. I feel so tired and the pain at the injection site is now even worse. I am getting chest pains, dizzy spells, really bad headache, and it feel like I am in a dream state unable to do things I normally can do. I am not okay and really regret getting the vaccine. I had no prior health concerns and probably would have survived covid, but it feels like I may never get my mental functioning back again.

I was unable to sleep due to the pain and around 2am it became severe to the point of being unbearable. Standing would relieve the pressure enough so i attempted to remain standing as tolerable. I also had severe lower back pain that made it difficult to walk. These symptoms remained until apx 3pm the day following the vaccine (4/8/21).

                                                Fever got to 104.6,  freezing  so badly couldn?t feel hot water.  Our hands turned purple on the top and our fingers turned white, as if circulation issue - example of how it physically looked.  Couldn?t sit up without almost passing out.  Couldn?t walk without assistance.  Body aches so bad - I?ve never experienced this type of ache, and I?ve had three children.  This all started around 6pm same day of receiving the vaccine.  My husband started the same shortly after.  With exact symptoms, plus he had shortage of breath.  Fevers finally broke 1am- then we both felt better, until later the next day.   Body aches continued, not as badly as day before.  Sweating and chills.  Husband woke up the next night completely drenched from fever breaking.  Fatigue and soreness followed for next couple days.  By Tuesday April 6th finally felt normal again.   Minus continued sore arm.  Wanted to repost due to high fevers, feelings of passing out, and our hands turning purple.  Would think off coincidence if had it not happened to both of us.

Same night, we started feeling chills, fever, muscle pain, fatigue, headache all at one time gradually increasing throught the day. Only in the eve, we could contact our physician &amp; advised to take paracetomol( acetominophen)  and we took three doses with 4 hrs interval. The next day eve, we came to normalcy with our regular work, less tiredness, less muscle ache, less headache (not fully gone)and fever stopped. After 3rd day- april 9th till today there are no side effects mild or adverse seen in us. Still due to recent reports/news about J&amp;J, we would like to stay vigilant for next 2months.. Hence, wanted to voulntarily report or update on our experience of the shots

                                                One week after I received it, I noticed I&#39;ve had shortness of breath. It&#39;s not bad, but it&#39;s more difficult for me to breath through my mask, especially when I&#39;m talking. When I&#39;ve been talking for a while, I can&#39;t quite catch my breath. Also, I&#39;ve slightly lost taste. Food tastes a bit &#39;off,&#39; and some items even taste bitter. I had cake the other day, and, to my disappointment, it was bitter (my family said it tasted fine. It was just me). Also, for two and a half weeks from the onset of they symptoms, I had intense flu-like symptoms. I felt achy all over and fatigued, which chills. I found it odd because it started so late and lasted so long. The flu-like symptoms are the only things that have subsided.

Patient reported to ED provider that using ibuprofen nearly relieves headache and makes her functional and had the most improvement the day she visited the ED prior to her visit. Patient received a CT scan of the head without contrast that was unremarkable. Patient was diagnosed with headache and neck sprain and was prescribed ibuprofen 600 mg, take 1 tablet by mouth every 8 hours, and diazepam 5 mg, take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times a day as needed for muscle spasm. 2021-04-12 - patient developed left lower extremity pain 2021-04-14 - patient followed up with Neurologist outpatient as directed by ED provider and was advised to get an MRV and left lower extremity doppler. Patient was prescribed tramadol 50 mg and butalbital/acetaminophen/caffeine (Fioricet) by the Neurologist. 2021-04-15 - patient presented to Medical Center ED before outpatient MRV and LLE doppler could be done due to worsening right-sided neck pain and inability to ambulate comfortably due to lower extremity pain that had been worsening over several days. Upon examination, there is subtle swelling to left lower extremity and doppler revealed multiple DVTs in left lower extremity. CT head without contrast was unremarkable, however, CT venogram of the brain reveals thrombi of the right transverse sinus and sigmoid sinuses, as well as IJ. Patient was initiated on argatroban and admitted to inpatient at the time of this report. &#34;Heparin induced platelet antibody&#34; and &#34;lupus anticoagulant evaluation&#34; tests are ordered and pending.

                                                I got the vaccine on 4/7/21 at approx. 10am. Soreness at injection site started about an hour later. At approx. 3pm that day I began to have body aches and chills and had a low grade fever and a very bad and continuous headache. Those symptoms lasted approx. 24-36 hours. By Friday 4/9, I was feeling better and fever was gone. Starting approx. Sun 4/11 I began to have a dull headache wrapping around the back of my head/neck and began having muffled hearing (bilateral, but more prominent in left ear). On 4/15 at approx. 1:15pm I was sitting at my desk and suddenly my heart rate went from resting heart rate to 150. I could feel the pounding in my head and ear and also placing my hand over my heart. I tried to stand up to walk around thinking that might help my heart rate, but I felt faint, so I immediately drove myself to urgent care. My heart rate came down and was back to normal approx. 5-10 min from onset. EKG and CT were done in the ER. I was released approx. 5-6 hours after arrival and told to treat headache with Tylenol or Ibuprofen (which I have not done so far because I normally try not to take medications), and follow up with my primary doctor in a week. Headache and muffled hearing are still present today (4/17), predominately affecting left ear.

Was starting to feel better so was able to sit up in a chair for about 15 minutes. Another wave of dizziness and nausea came over and was lying on the floor again. It was hard to breathe, but oxygen and HR were good. The doctor tried to give me juice to see if it was my blood sugar going low, but afterward, I still felt dizzy and nauseated. It was still hard to breathe. It felt like something was sitting on my chest. BP was elevated, oxygen levels were good, HR was good but I started to get a cold chill where my teeth were chattering. At that point (about 45 min to an hour) the symptoms had not gone away and the ambulance was called. Was transported to the local hospital where I received a liter of saline and Zofran for nausea.  BP was high, but oxygen levels and HR were good. The heart monitor showed no signs of arrhythmia or tachycardia so I was discharged. The doctor believes it was a side effect and not an allergic reaction.

Approximately 25 minutes into the observation period the patient was noted to be lethargic, weak, was able to answer questions stated that she felt tingling in throat, numbness, tingling in extremities, back pain.  Progressed to feeling itchiness and continued lethargy, was not able to answer what day it was.  At that point we assissted patient in wheelchair to get on stretcher behind curtain.  Patient given diphenhydramine 50 mg x 1 at 1600,  patient became more lethargic and given epinephrine 0.5 mg x 1 at 1603.  Vitals after epi were sbp 138, HR ?? reported as elevated, and 02 sats 98.  911 was called.  Patient was also nauseous once in wheelchair and on stretcher, wretching when transferred to stretcher patients lower extremities began shaking, lasting a few seconds.

I t was reported to me that patient had been cleared by her MD to receive vaccine but to be monitored for 30 minutes.

I fainted at table, then my spouse didn&#39;t know when he came downstairs, he thought my head was just resting at the table. He asked if I wanted to walk to the couch to rest, and as he helped me do so, I fainted and he caught me and carried me to the couch. Recovered within 1 minute but my hearing was  fuzzy for a couple more minutes, sounded like static in my ears.  Other reactions were:  Standard ones I read could happen- Fever of 100.1 that lasted less than a day, chills, aches, warm feeling and fatigue.

Then after dinner chills started and would not go away even though  I was covered in blankets by a fire.  I was also very tired.  In the evening around 8 or 9 my temperature was 103 and my resting heartbeat was 120.  I took medicine and also put a cold compress on my forehead.  I was able to sleep that night and the next day I had a low grade fever most of the day (99-100) and was tired and a little chilly.  I only took medicine around dinner time and got extra sleep that night.

                                                six hours after the vaccine, very sleepy, light chills/body aches, had to take a nap from tiredness. Woke up 20 min later, chills and body symptoms continued to worsen. Got very bad, could not get off the couch, in lots of pain. Nausea started. Light headache, Lasted for about 6 hours until I decided to take Tylenol and a bath. This helped immensely! After the bath I got very warm, burning up. Slept some and the next day felt significantly better. Light body aches and headache, tired. Back to almost 100% two days later/48 hrs.

                                                Starting in the afternoon after my shot I started feeling extremely cold. I had chills and my teeth were actually chattering at one point it was so bad. This gradually got worse as the evening went on. With it I also started feeling weak and fatigued. By 8pm I started to have a headache. Throughout the night symptoms worsened and I had a fever and more serious headache. My head was pounding so badly. I couldn&#39;t sleep at all. I also had a couple hot flashes to where I woke up sweating. Then I would feel frozen again. The nausea started during the night too. I thought I would throw up but didn&#39;t. At one point my heart was racing so fast I was a little concerned something bad would happen to me and contemplated going to the hospital. By morning I felt a little better, still nauseous and with a bad headache. My body was a little weak. These symptoms lasted all day Thursday. By that Friday morning I only had a little weakness and slight headache. By mid day Friday I was pretty much back to normal.

Few hours later developed typical &#34;flu like symptoms&#34;.  Next day woke up and both arms, hands, legs and feet and side of face had pins and needles and felt numb. Heart rate sky rocketed and went to ER. Felt like I was going to pass out.  Took blood work at hospital and doctors reassured that the feeling should come back in my legs and arms. When I left  6 hours later my legs were still pins and needles and my joints began to hurt.  A week later and this feeling continues to come and go, but is not consistent.  My joints still randomly hurt and I am an active 38 year old with three kids.

                                                Within a couple of minutes of receiving the injection I experienced pain and numbness in my left arm down through my hand. These symptoms are consistent with what I experience during a migraine. Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the vaccine the pain expanded to my neck and face on the left side, soon after followed by a mild headache.   Over the course of the day, within a couple of hours of vaccination, my headache remained mild but expanded to a general head pain that wasn?t confined to just one location. Also around this time I began experiencing neck muscle soreness and became very tired.  It is now approximately 10 hours post vaccination and I still have a mild headache. Migraine symptoms still present but not as notable. I feel run down, tired, an overall sense of malaise, and have full body mild muscle soreness.  No medications or treatments used so far to treat these symptoms.

                                                I was extremely fatigued the next day, April 1st, after my vaccine. I went to work but had to leave after lunch because I was so exhausted. I rested the entire rest of the day. I had a low grade fever of 100.9. On April 2nd, I felt much better and was able to carryon with my regular activities.

I continued running that temperature for a few hours and then  around 10am on 3-25-2021 I woke up and took my temperature and it dropped to 102.1. I fluctuated between 101.5 and 102.1 for rest of that day and by 3-26-2021 my temperature was back to normal. I had other common side effects with the fever but that was my only concern was the high fever.

EMS was called, she was evaluated.  She was not transported and was released to go home after evaluation and complete resolution of her symptoms. I spoke with her today, she states she had a similar episode after her nasal piercing 2 years ago and she believes related to anxiety.  She states other than arm soreness and muscle aches today, no other symptoms persist.

The burning has decreased over this past week, but I am still experiencing it with some exertion, but not consistently.  Fatigue continues some and SOB at random times.

                                                5.5 hours after getting the vaccine, I had chills (guessing I had a fever) body aches, a headache, joint pain, muscle pain, skin pain, nausea, I was exhausted, felt very emotional (felt like crying), had the constant feeling like I needed to stretch, and I could not get comfortable or lay still. At one point my fever broke, I woke up at 245 am drenched in sweat. The symptoms previously stated all came back about 255 am. I could not get comfortable or sleep but was extremely exhausted.  I tossed and turned getting tiny naps here and there until I got out of bed at 8 am (4/8/2021), I was again drenched in sweat, tired, had a headache,  was nauseous and food sounded horrible. I could not move around much because of joint/muscle pain and would get random bouts of chills. I had to just lay down all day but was never hungry and  did not eat again until that night around 7pm. On 4/9/2021 I woke up at 630am drenched in sweat I was still tired and could not exert myself (just going downstairs made me have to stop and catch my breath) throughout the day I would get random nerve pain in the elbow  and forearm of the shot arm. This morning I woke up with the shot site hurting worse, a headache, still tired and drenched in sweat (it was 40 degrees in my house and i had a thin blanket covering me). My appetite is back today but still cannot exert myself.

My stomach hurt, I was nauseated. I went through hot &amp; cold sweats &amp; chills. I got really light headed &amp; disoriented. I began to get a fever.  I felt far from flu symptoms. My heart was racing. I had to get into my shower repeatedly &amp; just lay. I cried. I dont recommend this to anyone! It has been 2 days &amp; i am still experiencing symptoms. I read the fact sheet for the Janssen shot. I am going to get a check up by a doctor. I feel like I am having an allergic reaction. I never felt so much pain in my life; my side effects are far from the flu symptoms.

I went to dr who advised I was having an allergic reaction and told me to take benedryl I had a 2in by 2inch hive under my skin at my time of visit which had gone down a little because of benedryl and it was extremely painful even 9 days out. I experienced extreme confusion and mental fog from Sunday all the way to Wednesday where I felt confused, and was having some rapid breathing.

                                                Received vaccine at 4:10pm on Thursday 4/8/21. 2 hours later, at 6:15pm, I noticed mild tongue swelling which slowly continued to worsen. I pulled out my Epipen but was not having any difficulties breathing and my tongue was only mildly swollen still, so I took Zyrtec at 8pm (which I usually do), and continued to monitor. Zyrtec seemed to slow the progression of tongue swelling slightly but at 10pm, I started having a dry cough and wheezing. I took Albuterol and Benadryl and that worked to stop the tongue swelling. Please note, the reason I don?t use Epi immediately is because I have Reynaud?s and it is contraindicated. So I use other rescue meds first if I can. My O2 sats remained above 95%, so I was not in full anaphylaxis. I did not eat anything or come in contact with anything within those 2 hours that would have caused the allergic reaction, so I am positive it was the vaccine. I also have a red, raised itchy bump at the site.

                                                Around 2 hours after the vaccine I had diarrhea for 2 hours (so from about 12:30pm-2:30pm). After that I felt flushed, and around 5:30pm I had a fever and my heart rate began to rise and blood pressure drop.. My heart rate continued to rise until about 9:30pm, and then it began to fall. I also experienced a terrible headache, moderate body aches, and chills and hot flashes. But the diarrhea and rapid heart rate were very concerning to me--I felt very sure something was wrong. This morning I have a low heart rate and low blood pressure and I feel very weak, but other symptoms are gone. I don&#39;t have a primary care doctor and read that the diarrhea and heart symptoms could be signs of a severe reaction and I wanted to report it.

                                                I had period like cramping, sever muscle cramps everywhere I ever had an injury in my life hurt. It get like the day after a car accident. Starting at 8 hrs after the vaccine was administered. When I breastfeed my baby for 36 hours after it felt like razor blades when the milk passed through my nipples and I had clogged ducts. Normally it is not painful and I don?t experience clogs. I got temporary relief soaking in Epsom salts in a hot bath. Even in the hot bath my nipples wouldn?t flatten or go smooth. I?ve never experienced a totally body reaction like this. It really get like every pain receptor that ever had activated reactivated. After 6 hours it subsided and I felt fatigued. During this time my temp was 102.5 I had a fever for 8 hrs. The second day at hour 28 the muscle aches returned but not as bad. While I don?t have a temperature I still feel warm and flushed and had trouble sleeping the second night my back is still sore.

After symptoms broke, the feeling of sluggish occurred all next couple of days. Throughout, it seemed like I could not quench my thirst.  Additionally, red bumpy rash on my legs (mostly thighs) occurred and itching along with it on legs. Not enough to go to emergency room, but definitely uncomfortable. Took Benadryl to help. Subsided about a week later. At injection site, only bruise which I am guessing was from some abnormal bleeding that occurred at injection. I barely had any soreness in the arm.  Lastly, a feeling of inability to take a deep enough breath. A feeling of if I had vicks on my chest type cool feeling when I took a breath. The feeling has lingered until now, but not enough to cause any issue. I can breath, but not full deep breaths. Because it has been getting better every day, I imagine it will subside soon. I will go to doctor if it does not get better.

Numbness lasted about an hour. 40-50 minutes post vaccine nausea would come and go. 4 hours post vaccine the typical flu-like symptoms began: extreme fatigue, mild headache, muscle weakness, painful skin, lack of appetite.

                                                April 7th about 6:30pm: I became very confused, having trouble remembering where I was or answering simple questions.  Around that same time my vision became blurry, and my face in and around my mouth became numb, I began to slur as a result.  The numbness and slurring increased over the next hour or so.  After that hour or so, I realized I was exhausted and my head hurt so I went to sleep. I also had a strange emotional response to all of this, I behaved giddily and as though it were funny.  April 8th about 8am: I woke up and the confusion, blurry vision, numbness, and slurring were gone.  I had a mild headache, brain fog, and was still more tired than usual.  Later that evening the headache developed in to something more like a migraine, intense pain focused behind my right eye and blurred vision.  At this time I again decided to go to sleep.  It would have been about 8pm.  April 9th about 8am: I woke up still feeling a moderate headache focused on the right side, still tired, and brain fog.  The symptoms weakened throughout the day and by the evening I was feeling mostly normal again.   I have felt healthy and normal since.

                                                I have many allergies and adverse events from prior vaccines, so I took a Benadryl before the injection. I was very pleased nothing detrimental happened at the time. My head and neck were a little itchy but went away, some dizzyness but went away, all after about an hour. The arm didn&#39;t blow up like usual.  That night, I started to experience the usual vaccine side effects i.e. headache, feverish, sweating, joint aches. All this I expected starting around 8:45 -9pm.   At about 10 - 10:30 pm, I began to have abdomen pain/pelvic pain... I started feeling like I was getting period cramps and lower intestinal discomfort. I just had my period though, so it didn&#39;t make sense (about 7 -10 days ago). I am also on the pill so I know for a fact I just had it and started a new pack. I was very confused and thought it was odd...can&#39;t be, maybe it would go away.   I woke up about 3am with intense uterus/period cramps which kept me up, in and out of sleep. About 5am I felt like I had my period (fluid down there), went to the bathroom and indeed, I was bleeding... a lot. The cramps continued, the bleeding continued and now 6 days later it is finally going away. I never get head aches and my head has continued to hurt on and off also.

                                                Starting about 6 hours after administration I developed a headache and low grade fever around 100.1. I was ill that night and still feeling tired the following day and feverish. My left knee, which I had previously had a lateral meniscus transplant with a cadaver graft, starting swelling up and becoming increasingly uncomfortable. By Wednesday the 17th, I could barely put weight on the leg and the pain level had increased to 6/10, with 10 being the worst pain. This knee had previously been on a positive healing trajectory since my surgery. By Wednesday night, I couldnt put weight on it and pulled out the crutches to walk (I had been off of them since early February). I was dealing with a family emergency so did not have the capacity to deal with it at the time. Thursday morning, the 18th, all of my joints started becoming painful. I chalked this up to vaccine reaction. I was still fatigued and the knee was still extremely sensitive and couldn&#39;t bear weight. Friday and Friday night my joints became visible swollen and were so painful I was crying trying to find a comfortable sleeping position. I couldn&#39;t put any pressure on my shoulders for sleeping, the neck was stiff and tight, my hands and feet were visibly swollen with fluid and I couldnt even lift a cup due to the painful, enlarged finger joints. Every joint in my body seemed effected. Saturday morning I called my doctor who determined it was due to the vaccine and it seemed my immune system was attacking my joints. I was prescribed 40mg of predinsone in a 8 day taper. By 24 hours, the pain had receeded to a normal level of ache and I could put some pressure on my left leg again. By 48 hours after starting steroids, the swelling was reduced and I started to feel more normal. I have no history of autoimmune disorders or previous rhematoid issues.

                                                * Arm was very sore for about the first 10 minutes.  Moving it reduced it pretty quickly and was no worse than a minor ache for most of the next day or so. * Had a mild headache before the shot (believe due to not having had caffeine that day yet) * At about 6 pm on 4/10, lost appetite due to mild nausea (just enough to not want to eat but not enough to vomit) * At about this time I noticed I also started to feel a little winded, akin to walking just briskly enough that you have to breath harder than if you&#39;re just sitting / resting.  It did not get any worse than this however, so I opted to keep a close eye and see if it eased (which it would by end of Sunday, 4/11) * At about 8:30 pm on 4/10, noticed I felt warm, had a fever between 100.4 to 100.8 * Also around 8:30 pm I noticed that pain I normally feel from my herniated discs and pinched nerves (L4/L5 L5/S1) just ACHED and was more painful than normal. * Started feeling tired (I&#39;m usually up until around 1-2 am, and I was ready to go to bed by 9pm on 4/10)  Also felt a little forgetful / hard to concentrate on anything * When I went to bed, I noticed that my eyes were very sensitive to the white light from my monitor.  This is usually a sign of a painless migraine with auras that essentially blind me for about a half hour.  I did not have auras, though my headache was steadily getting worse to the point I suspect it might have actually been a migraine) * At about 12:30 am on 4/11, the headache got to the point where I could no longer ignore it (best I can describe is it felt like someone was trying to peel my skull of like you would an orange) so I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen.  I also by this point had a fever of 102, though it would drop to 100.5 or so within a few minutes of taking the Ibuprofen. * At about this point the arm starting aching a lot more, I assume because I wasn&#39;t using it while sleeping.  It felt like someone had punched me multiple times hard in the same spot. * I felt much better on the morning of 4/11.  However as the day continued I felt more and more tired.  My temperature was higher than normal but very mild; it stayed around 99.8 for most of the day that I took it.  By Monday, 4/12 I felt mostly fine aside from my arm aching worse than it did when I first got the shot.  Now on 4/14 its pretty much no longer achy.

Pharmacy gave Benadryl when advised of reaction.   15 mins later family drove me to ER to wait to for the Benadryl to take effect in case ER services were needed. ER services were not needed once Benadryl took effect.  I?m at day 14 and still having lingering reoccurring headaches and fatigue.

I woke up at 1am the the next day (4.10.21) with a severe migraine and my heart racing. The migraine was so severe that just bending down made my head pound with extreme pain. I felt very hot and was sweating profusely and my clothes were soaked. I was also very thirsty and drank several glasses of water. I took 4 ibuprofen as it had been 8 hours since my last dose and laid back down in bed and tried to relax. I fell back asleep within 1-2 hours. I felt fine the next morning but did have a slight headache, but it was nothing compared to what I woke up to during the night.

                                                Around 6 pm on the ninth, I started to feel lethargic; really lethargic. 8:30 pm - 100.5 fever. 09:00 pm I had chills that shook my body. Very intense. Extreme body aches and especially legs which prompted me to use a weighted blanket. That was all overnight and excessive sweating overnight. That may have been from the fever. I had nausea that started around midnight. That was mild. I did notice a little bit of a headache at that time as well which was mild. Saturday, fever all day, fatigue. Overnight that night - a little achy; but the chills had gone away. Tuesday night the body aches had gone away - they had diminished Saturday- Monday. I had body aches until about 6 or 7 pm on Monday. The fatigue -all this week I&#39;ve still been dragging - I&#39;m still tired. The fever would go up and down with Tylenol but I needed it until Sunday night. Headache - the first one was gone Saturday morning. I had a headache  Sunday evening and Monday morning. It was gone about lunch time.  The injection site was tender with the delivery of the shot until Sunday when I went to bed. It was not pain but just tender to the touch. Usually that happens with any shot for me but usually it doesn&#39;t stay tender for that long. April 13th - Televisit with a Physician&#39;s Asst in my doctor&#39;s office.

                                                1. I had some mild pain the next day after vaccine.  2. On Saturday, 4 days after receiving the vaccine, I had severe pain that decreased after taking tylenol 3. The arm pain has been consistently present since I received the vaccine.  4. March 25, 2021, I told my nurse practitioner about the continued pain; no intervention was done.  4. On March 28, 2021, I had chills and arm pain, so as a healthcare provider myself, I suspected cellulitis. 5. On 3/302021, I started antibiotic Keflex and finished entire course for suspected cellulitis, yet had no warmth or redness at injection site or surrounding area.  6. 4/15/2021, evaluated by NP again for continued arm pain, as it hurts to turn my steering wheel of my car, lift my arm in any way. Had normal bloodwork for suspected DVT, and STAT ultrasound ordered, after I requested NP to change order to STAT 7. 4/16/2021, had scan for DVT which was negative.  8. Used Tylenol and warmth to area on 4/16/2021, at 11:00pm, and pain increased!!! 9. I am concerned that I have muscle injury at this point, and I need to speak with someone

My left hand experienced the same shooting pain followed by tingling in my fingers. My right arm them experienced the same pain and tingling. I then began to sweat, get dizzy and felt like fainting. I have had pain and tingling in my hands and feet ever since, along with sensitivity. I also have pain in my joints and legs similar to what I imagine arthritis would feel like. I also have throbbing chest pain and pain in my legs since vaccination.

I have an IUD in place (placed in December 2017).  The first 24 hours after receiving the vaccine,  I had mild symptoms of headache, low grade fever and aches from the neck up. 2 days after receiving my vaccine, my period began and continued as a light period until April 14, 2021.  I continued with headaches in the temporal region and experienced light headedness and blurred vision throughout the day (still continues as of today 4/19/21). I went to my primary physician on 4/15/21 and was sent for labs (CBC, CMP, and TSH level), an EKG (after hearing an irregular heart rhythm), and a MRI of my brain. All of my labs and MRI were reported as normal. My EKG showed occasional PVC&#39;s.

Did not itch which I found strange bc they looked like flea bites. But I went to the ER and said they were purpura.

I regret taking this vaccine.  If there was a way to undo this I would.

Those symptoms lasted about 24 hours and, by midday Wednesday, she was back to her baseline of intermittent dry cough, shortness of breath, and no smell or taste.  It wasn&#39;t until Sunday, two days ago, that she developed sharp, pinpoint right superior parietal scalp pain that, after a few doses of OTC Aleve, did somewhat improve.  Other than two 220 mg OTC Aleve tabs twice daily, she has not been taking anything else for her symptoms other than prescribed asthma/allergy meds. She states that her shortness of breath has been helped from the use of albuterol as needed.  Unfortunately, the Aleve has not helped with her chest pain, which she describes as a &#34;constant ache.&#34;  Initially, patient had some pleurisy, but that has apparently cleared up.     No history of CVT, PE, and she does not smoke or take oral contraceptives.

                                                Upon injection into the right arm, blood started to pour out of the injection site. Bleeding stopped once the nurse administered pressure. There were no immediate side effects present, other than soreness at the injection site. Approximately 17 hours after the vaccination, the following symptoms started: nausea, malaise, fever (102.3), chills, headache, and lower back pain. The onset of side effects was intense and required that I immediately stop what I was doing and rest.

                                                Shortly after the vaccine on the drive home the injection site got super hot, the arm began to swell and turn red.  I developed a fever and my sinuses got really stuffy.  I began to throw up profusely which made all symptoms from other issues occur causing me to swell all over and because I couldnt take any meds or keep anything down I went to the ER.   While there I began wheezing and experiencing SOB which still is an issue today.  I have foggy moments where my brain seems so foggy that I am having issues with my short term memory.  I was administered IV fluids, IV morphine and IV ibuphropen to help with the symptoms and was hospitalized for less than a day further evaluation

                                                I started experiencing flu-like symptoms at around 5 PM on 3/14/21.  I was feverish and had chills, muscle aches, and a headache.  I had very strong chills for a few hours and then I noticed that my resting heart rate was around 128 bpm at around 1:30 AM on 3/15/21.  I was running a 100.6 fever at that time.  My fever subsided in the morning and the headache persisted throughout the day, and I was very tired as I did not get much sleep the night before.  I did not work that day (Monday, 3/15).  At the time I was about 7 weeks pregnant.  I noticed some very light spotting later in the day on 3/15, and then I continued spotting on 3/16.  I consulted a midwife at the  facility at 4 PM on 3/16/21 and took a blood test to measure my hCG hormone levels.  The following day, 3/17, I received the results that I had a normal level of hCG hormone and normal hemoglobin levels.  As the day continued, the spotting turned into bleeding, and eventually the bleeding became heavy starting around 4 PM.  I received an ultrasound on 3/18/21 at 8 AM and later spoke with a midwife from facility at 11 AM that day, confirming that there was no viable pregnancy detected via ultrasound.  I had lost quite a bit of blood at that point.  I am, as of 8:35 PM on Friday,  March 19th, still bleeding and experiencing the impact of miscarriage.

As I walked to the restroom to vomit I lost 100% of my vision, I became very disoriented and had the loudest screeching in both ears. I screamed for my husband and I caught me as I was taken to the floor with no mobility. The episode last several minutes before he was able to move me back to bed. I had severe sweating and ear ringing. As I report this I still have a lingering brain fog and ear ringing.  I reported it to my physician and told to go to the ER if any reoccurrence of reaction.

                                                Pregnant (24 weeks, 6 days at time of vaccination; EDD is 6/23/2021).  I reported on the v-safe&#39;s daily check-in that one day I was totally exhausted and had to take a nap. I slept for about 2 hours. The exhaustion was akin to the first semester of pregnancy exhaustion when you can barely stay awake. I was fine after. The exhaustion was significant enough that I could not focus on work, so I decided to nap. On the v-safe reporting, I indicated that this &#34;interferred with my daily work&#34; or whatever that category of assessing the impact is. The agency staff who reached out to me after for details asked that I fill out this form and submit it. I do not remember the exact date of the exhaustion but, if possible to match my v-safe checklist with this report, it is available there. I believe it was 3/16.

The pain is in my forearm and bicep deep in the muscle. Excruciating pain when gripping and lifting things. Weakness in the left arm.

                                                I have a history of anaphylaxis, and disclosed that to the medics so they watched me more carefully, which was good, as while I did not experience anything that severe, I did immediately get itchy, turn red and feel quite nauseated. However,  after they monitored me awhile, I told them I felt okay to go home. The next day I had the expected mild flu-like symptoms, which I anticipated. However, what?s been atypical is they returned tenfold three days later. This time with a much higher fever (103), severe chills, fatigue, a seemingly never-ending headache,  muscle spasms,  chest palpitations and suddenly I am experiencing asthma (which is typically seasonal) and am coughing, too.  I?m now a week past when I was vaccinated and each day was feel worse, not better. I have had to cancel my clients and hire a sitter to care for my kids as I am too weak and ill to do it.  I looked up common reactions and nothing states chest pain and/or asthma, nor that it should last this long. That said, as I am high-risk, I work from home and homeschool both of my young kids. Thus, I have been nowhere aside from the vaccine site. Moreover, my partner, our kids and sitter get routinely tested for me,  and everyone is negative. Thus, it appears I am having prolonged, heightened side-effects much more intense than the ?mild? flu-like symptoms otherwise reported, which is concerning. I took no medication prior to receiving the vaccine, either.

                                                Immediate injection site pain including stinging and burning.  Site continued to sting for over an hour post injection.  Burning feeling at injection site continued for several hours.  Brain fog and chills set in within 2 hours post injection.  Fatigue, headache, and joint stiffness and pain started about 4 hours post injection.  Injection was given on left arm; left hand became painful about 4 hours post injection, as though someone had put it in a vice.  Joint pain worsened.  Upon laying down to sleep, I became so cold I could not get warm even with an electric blanket on high.  Started to feel stabbing pains in my jaw, back of my neck and down behind my shoulder blade on my left side.  Headache worsened and started to feel pressure in my ears.  Joints, my knees in particular, felt like they were made of gravel and someone was stabbing them with a hot poker.  Did not sleep due to pain.  Has been 20 hours post vaccine, injection site is still very painful and swollen.  Joint pain, headache, fatigue and chills continue.  Was unable to go to work today.

The patient&#39;s weight was 132 pounds, and height was approximately 63.5 inches (5&#39;3 and half). The medical history included: no family history of disease or no allergies. The patient was not pregnant nor breastfeeding at the time of vaccination. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26,cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805029) dose was not reported, administered on 07-MAR-2021 10:40 for prophylactic vaccination. The vaccination site was left arm. No concomitant medications were reported. The patient was not ill prior to receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient never had a history of any similar event or adverse reaction to any other previous vaccinations in the past. The patient did not have any pre-existing acute illnesses 30 days prior to vaccinations nor was the patient hospitalized in the last 30 days. The patient never had been tested for COVID-19. The patient did not wait the full 15 minute time frame as she was instructed. One hour after vaccination while driving home with her mother on freeway, the patient began to experience some numbness on the left upper part of her head and then the numbness went down the left side of her face. The patient was having difficulty breathing and described it as if, &#34;someone was on her chest&#34; and lasted 5-6 minutes but the numbness still persisted and went down to her arms and legs. The patient&#39;s throat felt like it was swollen. The patient also felt &#34;tired&#34; a day prior to this report (captured as unspecified date in MAR-2021) and slept for a total of 14 hours and &#34;felt better today&#34;. The patient had been afebrile since being immunized. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient was recovering from difficulty breathing, had not recovered from facial numbness, same side that injection was done, and the outcome of felt tired and felt swollen throat was not reported. The reporter assessed causality for difficulty breathing and facial numbness, same side that injection as related. The reporter causality for the event of felt tired and Swollen throat was possible. Company causality between COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.COV2.S and facial numbness, same side that injection, felt tired and Swollen throat was possible. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition). Additional information was received from reporter on 12-MAR-2021. The following information was updated and incorporated into the case narrative: Patient&#39;s medical history updated, the non-serious event swollen throat and details concerning reported events added.

                                                Slight chills started to set in 8 hours after the injection. After an hour long bath, the chills were extreme. I shivered and sweated for 12 hours overnight with a severe headache. I tossed most of the night and had to get up to pee 3 times throughout the night - which is extremely uncommon. By 24 hours after the injection, I still had a strong headache and was mostly able to regulate my body temp. By 36 hours after, I felt tired but no longer had a headache or chills. My injection site is red, raised and very tender.

Couldn?t open eyes or move fingers.  Light headed...blacking out when I got up to go the bathroom.  Couldn?t have any sounds (like tv) on.  Just needed to lay still and sleep.    The above lasted 19 hours.    Then my temperature ended.  I had trouble walking and standing for another 20 hours. No stamina.   I went to work near the end of this and noticed I had trouble looking at my paperwork and figuring what to do for my job.  Not sure if this was still the fatigue just in a different way.  Then it disappeared.

                                                Nausea and headache within a minute of vaccination, then after going home began to feel fatigued and achy. By 7-8 hours after receiving the shot, I started noticing a fever. Had a fever of 102 all night along with chills, extreme body aches, and headache. Temperature stayed between 100.5 and 101.5 all day today (the day after the vaccine), and the body aches and general feeling of being unwell are still being experienced. I am guessing my immune system is reacting to the vaccine and hopefully the symptoms will subside soon. I have not reached out to my doctor at this time.

About 30 mins to an hour later I notice that every move I make, the joints I&#39;m moving hurt. Like EVERY joint is now sore when I move. (With the exception of fingers/toes) I tossed and turned all night and got a headache. The queasiness was very mild, but happened any time I moved.  This morning now my joints no longer hurt, but I still have the headache.

Then I noticed I was sweating real bad and I was so weak it took all my energy to just lift my head off my pillow. Small burst of energy like sitting up became  quite a challenge. All I have done is sleep none stop and when i wake ive noticed a bit of confusion. For example I thought i woke up at 7am tomorrow and then kept falling back asleep on and off till about 8:30 when i realized it&#39;s still today. The body aches and pains were very rough too. My husband went at the same time for the same shot and what Im experiencing vs him is not comparable! He has mild discomfort mine is extreme. Also Ive had a headache a pretty bad one  since about 10pm yesterday as well. Ive been unable to even think about food Im too tired to care even. I have not ate since I was vaccinated yesterday. Ive never reacted to any vaccine or shot of any kind till now.

I also felt like my heart was racing and I was going to pass out. I remained at the pharmacy for approx another hour, still not feeling well. EMS was called, checked my BP and heart rate, which was a little elevated. SBP 137, HR 90-low 100&#39;s. I did take some liquid benadryl while still at the pharmacy. After about an hour and a half to 2 hours, the feeling completely subsided. The symptoms began again today 4/9/21 at approx 1015am. I have taken another benadryl capsule.

                                                After the immunization was administered to the patient, she was asked to have a seat in the waiting area for observation.  A few minutes after she sat, she told her husband who was seated with her she didn&#39;t feel well (he did not inform us).  The technician observing her noticed she passed out and reported to the pharmacist (myself).  I designated a team member to call 911 and ran out to the patient.  She was extremely pale and her lips were blue.  With the assistance of her husband I laid her on the floor, had him elevate her feet and checked for pulse and breathing.  I couldn&#39;t immediately find her pulse but within 30 seconds she began to come to.  She appeared to tremor a few times as she came to and her color began to return.  She was extremely confused and did not know where she was upon awakening.  EMS arrived on the scene approximately 10-15 minutes after the event.  They did standard patient evaluation which was unremarkable and proceeded to bring her to the local ED,  According to the patient, the ED visit yielded nothing and they said &#34;she couldn&#39;t be more healthy&#34;.  One note, that was revealed in conversation with the patient while waiting for EMS to arrive is that the patient had very little to eat or drink prior to being administered the vaccine.

                                                On March 10 (the day after my vaccine) I felt the normal body aches and had a pretty bad headache. That all went away in the evening on March 10. Since that day I have had off and on dizziness/lightheadedness. On March 19 I fainted in my kitchen. I hit my kitchen table and had a huge knot on my head and bruises all down my left side of my body. My left shoulder still hurts from the fall and I still have a small knot on my head (left side just above my left eye on my forehead). I went to my primary care doctor on  March 24 and reported the event. I asked if it could be related to the COVID vaccine and she said she wasn&#39;t sure since the Jansen one was so new, but that she had seen these effects from the other two vaccines.  At the doctor&#39;s office my blood pressure was on the lower end (110/60). My normal blood pressure runs about 118/70. They ran some blood work and that all came back normal. They did an EKG in the office, but my blood pressure stayed pretty close to the same as it was the first reading. They then sent me to get a CT scan on my head, which also came back normal. She did diagnose me with a concussion. I was out of work the entire week (March 22-March 26) due to this. She also ordered me to have an echo done. While at the office for the echo, my blood pressure ran 99/46 (this was on March 31). The results of the echo came back normal.  I also got a monitor to wear for 72 hours on March 31. I took that to the doctor on April 5 and I am still waiting on results from that.  Since the event on March 19, I have had headaches and body aches. I have also had slight lightheadedness off and on.

The cotton mouth, fatigue, headache and fever of 99.9 to 101 lasted until about 8:00am on 4/8/2021., where I had a second set of chills and the fever broke.  On 4/9/2021 I still had fatigue and had to leave work early as I couldn&#39;t multi-task and had a hard time staying focused.  The inability to focus and fatigue lasted 4/10/201 and 4/11/2021, just walking up and down my stairs at home exhausted me.  On 4/12/2021 I went back to work, my focus is better but still not back to where it should be, I still get exhausted easily and everything is a bit too bright.  On 4/12/2021 about 7:30am, I had a bloody nose that took a while to stop (about 30 minutes), that is not normal as I rarely have a bloody nose; I was late to work due to it and had another one while at work around 11:40am; it was not as bad as the first and stopped after approximately 10 minutes.  Today is 4/13/2021- Things are still a little too bright and my energy level is not quite back to normal, I also have a slight headache.

                                                Developed a headache in the afternoon following my vaccination that continued through the night. It was the worst in the middle of the night and early morning hours - similar to a migraine - and nothing seemed to help. I took multiple doses of Tylenol to try to take the edge off, but it just got progressively worse and interfered with my sleep until around 3 a.m. when I was finally able to fall asleep. By the time I woke up around 7 a.m., the pain was less intense.

My lower abdomen and back also hurt and was cramping as if I was in labor.  I took two Tylenol PM and 10mg of Cyclobenzaprine. Then the chills started, I have never been that cold in my life while I was shivering that is when the sweating started and a basically sweat through three pairs of pajamas last night. Woke up around 3am with a pounding headache. By 10am I was feeling wrung out, but a lot better. I took some more Tylenol and went back to sleep. Woke up around 3:30pm took a shower and was able to take my daughter to soccer. I am still weak and have some achiness in my knees and ankles.

At 12:30 AM that night I woke up to what felt like electric shocks going through my body (painful zaps) and in a full body sweat. No fever. I then started shaking uncontrollably and my heart rate increased to the 100s. The shaking and rapid heart rate lasted for 30 minutes. Woke up again multiple times with body sweats.  In the morning still lethargic but all symptoms resolved by noon.

                                                Immediately when I received the injection, I felt a cool fluid rush around my heart with a moderate discomfort/pain. I reported this to the tech who administered. He didn&#39;t seem alarmed &amp; advised I wait 15 mins. I still felt a &#34;coolness&#34; around my chest but otherwise felt &#34;fine&#34; so I was permitted to leave. As the day went on, I felt my chest (lungs &amp; area around my heart) feel tighter &amp; tighter &amp; my breath grew more &amp; more &#34;shallow&#34; like I couldn&#39;t take deep enough breaths &amp; I was short of breath. In the evening, it intensified. I was very fatigued (couldn&#39;t go up our stairs or talk in complete sentences without feeling &#34;winded&#34;). The tightness in my chest was worse &amp; was accompanied by periodic acute pain in my heart. I also had pain my lower back. I went to the emergency room around 10PM that night. An EKG, blood tests &amp; chest X-ray were conducted. The ER doctor said all tests came back &#34;normal&#34; &amp; they weren&#39;t sure what my issue was. I went home &amp; rested. I woke the next morning with the acute pains gone but the tightness still lingered. I did not feel &#34;normal&#34; until almost 72 hours after my vaccine.

Less than six hours in, headache set in, along with vomiting.  Around 10 hours after injection, fever, chills, cold sweats and severe body aches began and lasted approximately 36 hours. Fatigue set in sometime during day two and continues to linger six days later.

                                                After receiving my vaccine on March 14th, I started experiencing pressure in the left side of my head and severe headache.  As the days progressed, I was continuing to have severe headaches for the next couple of weeks.  I was taking exedrin Migrane medicine to try and calm it down.   When I would try an work out it was worse, it was like the pressure on the left side of my brain was expanding and it would be worse.  My legs and body did feel weak.  It has slowly gone down with less and less of these headaches over the last couple of weeks.  They were definitely different than what a normal migrane feels like and very specific type of feeling.  I don&#39;t know if I have had any clots or not, but I am currently trying to get into a neurologist to get looked at to make sure there is not something else going on.  I am going to try and contact Johnson and Johnson to see if they can help refer to a neurologist because I currently do not have health insurance.

Came and went and finally disappeared completely after 72 hours.  Also experienced dehydration and temporary decline in breastmilk production 24-48 hours after vaccinated.

                                                Immediately at 15 minutes: blurry vision; felt off and felt loopy (out of it);  I was dropping food on myself as I was eating. My pupils were really small. I felt out of it. Finally I got home (son drove me). I had mild chest pains and heart racing (had this initially, too). And the chest pains and heart racing kept happening off and on through the night. I had headaches that night and I felt nauseated. Next day, I had to wear sunglasses inside my  house as I was light sensitive and my pupils remained small. I still felt body aches and nausea but the eyes were the biggest concern...shining light by my eyes didn&#39;t make my pupils bigger. The light that came off my phone aggravated my eyes and my head. Thursday, I still had nausea but headache wasn&#39;t bad with Tylenol. Those full two days all I did was sleep. Friday, I felt like things were mild and Tylenol was helping. I called heathline for my eyes. As those still weren&#39;t improving. I got into my eye doctor for an exam (4/9). There was no inflammation and he decided to dilate my eyes. Of course, my eyes were blurry and my eyes responded to that dilation. I napped after returning home. My pupils after the nap were finally responding. I still had a little light sensitivity in my eyes but not as much as I had had and pupils were doing what they should with light. So this was 3 1/2 days later. I still do get mild headache and mild chest pain - it comes and it goes. I have a doctor appt - general check up  - that was already scheduled for tomorrow and he will examine for chest pain.

No other symptoms since then to date.

Carried on with my day like nothing happened.  3/29/2021: (1) Uncharacteristic, debilitating headaches began started around mid-afternoon (ish) and continued on/off - occurred approximately 5-7x and largely tapered off by 4/9/2021.  (2) extreme soreness continuously occurring on the upper right side of my back b/w the spine and scapula. I could barely move it most days. Has gotten slightly better beginning 4/12/2021, but remains unresolved as of this report.  4/15/2021: woke up with severe headache again.

                                                On the day after vaccination I had extreme dizziness and faintheadedness, and heavy brain fog. I could not drive or stand up for long periods of time. I was having issues expressing thoughts and having my normal conversations. This was accompanied by strong headache on right side of my head and slightly stuffed sinuses. The day afterwards all symptoms disappeared. However, they reappeared at milder levels intermittently through the next several days. I am now at day 14 with the dizziness and brain fog still occurring intermittently and last night had short episode of abdominal pain. I decided to call the doctor&#39;s office this morning when the dizziness started again, for advice and to schedule a brief exam. They told me to go straight to the ER instead, so I went and had blood drawn. Blood came back normal and likelihood of clot very low, so was released but referred to my primary doctor and a neurologist for follow up over the next week. The intermittent dizziness and brain fog persist ever since my shot 2 weeks ago. Additional symptoms that I believe to be normal are dull leg pain behind the knees, slight tightness in chest sometimes, and recurring mild headache.

This continued for the following two days.  On 4/10 I began what I thought to be menstrual bleeding, this flow  has been consistent and  persistent  as of today 4/18 with no indication of reducing in volume. On  4/15  I began to notice pin point non-clustered petechiea  throughout my arms legs and chest.  The number present on  my body appears to be increasing in a random distribution.  No other observable abnormalities at this time.

                                                Immediate arm pain when the injection was administered, was painful to raise arm after the shot, for hours. Made effort to continue to raise the arm and engage the muscle to alleviate pain, which helped by the end of *that day*, though tenderness persisted at the injection site for the following 4 to 5 days, including feeling pain when sleeping on that arm. Also, on the day of receiving the vaccine and dealing with the initial sore arm, I experienced a surge of energy lasting into the evening, that is common to me right before I fall sick ( for example as a runner, it sometimes manifests as a PR and then soon after that I get sick). The morning after the vaccine, I woke up slightly queasy, ate breakfast,  went for a bike ride and hike, then headache &amp; nausea appeared near lunchtime (1 pm). I pushed through the rest of the afternoon but headache/nausea worsened, and by late afternoon (maybe 5 pm) I also had developed body aches, chills (with sweats), and low-grade fever.

I still had  a slight headache. The abdominal pain comes and goes - I still get it to this day. I called my Dr and he referred me to go to ER on Tuesday, 13th. No treatment, they told me to follow up with dr if I had pain continue.  I just went today to a follow up with my doctor. She increased my medication for pain so I can get to work as I&#39;ve been out for the last 5 days since I have not been able to. She told me to do the Naproxen twice  a day now and also gave me Gabapentin and Tramadol.

                                                Within minutes of shot, on the shot going in - it stung so bad I cried and I have a high pain tolerance &gt; extreme nausea right after the shot was in; I felt short of breath - Heartrate - While standing in line, my heartrate was 75 or 76  and it went up to 130  beats per minute after the vaccine (I have a watch that tells me); my heart was racing. I was putting cold water bottles on my neck to feel better. Heartrate went from 130 to 100 at 45 minutes out. It stayed in the hundreds for a couple of hours. About three hours after shot - I developed itching and hives all over - chest, arms, and tops of thighs. I took Benadryl. The injection site on arm stayed incredibly painful - I couldn&#39;t even move my arm. 4/12/2021 - I got in contact with someone from Clinic. They felt like there had been a reaction to vaccine - advised to continue Benadryl. A localized reaction to injection site. First 48 hours  bone, muscle, joint pain was extreme - it hurt to be alive. It took a week for that to fade so I could function again. Got in contact with Dr. again 19th. Swollen oval under my skin about 2 -3 inches long at injection site; fatigue and nausea is still there. Ran some bloodwork. Advised to take Benadryl when itching came back. This morning, I called the doctor today 20th - an allergist was pulled in for this conversation as well - I was prescribed to take Zyrtec; Claritin and a prednisone (to prevent reaction from continuing) and also Zofran for the long term reaction to the vaccine. Watch the injection site for any redness and heat (there&#39;s none right now). Three days after vaccine, I did get a blistery rash across my neck at my collarbone area, down my chest and under my breast and across my rib cage on front and a little on my back on the back of my shoulders and down along the spine. Additionally there was a flat orangish rash that developed - on my face and nose. And then my skin started peeling off there and it (that flat orangish rash) showed up  also on the middle of my chest too right in the middle of the other rash on my chest. That is improving with the medications I&#39;m taking.

Concurrent medications includes ethinylestradiol/ferrous fumarate/norethisterone acetate, salbutamol, lactulose, clozapine, gabapentin, oxybutynin hydrochloride, pantoprazole, risperidone, valproate semisodium, vilazodone hydrochloride, and unspecified breathing treatments.  There was prior history of pulmonary embolism (PE) 9 years prior to vaccination and was advised to be due to obesity and lack of physical activity.  Emergency room consult for leg swelling 10 days after vaccination; diagnosed with PE with radiology and many other unspecified tests; treated with Eliquis.  Th event is confounded by increased risk with prior history of pulmonary embolism, obesity, OCP, and risperidone (class effect).  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.
