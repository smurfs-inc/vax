This continued until 03/17/2021 in which I felt only nauseated, bloated. My headache was kept at bay with acetaminophen.

                                                Minutes after I got the vaccine I started to lose hearing in my left ear (it sounded like I was under water) which slowly spread to my right ear as well. My hands and feet went numb and I started sweating all over. I felt sick to my stomach and I felt like I was above the whole situation-- I could hear the people talking but I felt like I was somewhere else. After resting my head on the table for about 10 minutes I felt better and was able to move to a cot where I rested for another 20 minutes or so until I felt pretty much back to normal. I was treated by the medical team at the site who cleared me to go home.

Woke up @12:30am with chills, a headache, soreness in the injection site, and body aches in the neck, back and legs.  Got up and tried stretching and drinking water. Stoped drinking water when I felt nauseas. Did not throw up. Took Ibuprofen and melatonin before falling asleep about 30 minutes after taking the medication. Woke up @3:00am and chills were gone, only left with pain in the knees and injection site. Wasn?t able to sleep until around 4:45am. When I woke up @7:45 am, I still had slight pain in the knees, I took Tylenol @10:45 am. Pain was on and off throughout the day. I took a hot bath, that helped the pain tremendously. Fatigue throughout the day. After sleeping the day after the shot, all symptoms are gone, only soreness in the injection site.

                                                I felt really good until late at night when I got a pretty mild headache, then I started shivering and I didn&#39;t stop for nearly an hour. My muscles were very tense and the headache got worse. I took ibuprophen and that seemed to help with the shivering and lessen the headache. It is now the morning after and I just have a mild, but persistent headache and skin sensitivity which I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related to getting the vaccine or not.

                                                I felt completely normal after getting the vaccine. Then at 8 pm (5 hours after getting it) I felt heat rushing to my head and face. I became very weak in my legs and I had to lay down. I took ibuprofen at 9 pm because my body aching was very intense. I woke up at 11:30 pm with such terrible body aches I could not sleep and I was crying from the pain. I had freezing chills and a throbbing headache. When I tried to stand up, I almost fell over because I felt so light-headed. I thought I was going to faint. I was so concerned about the amount of pain I was in that I called my doctor and public safety came and checked on me. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed for 3 hours. I drank Gatorade and took more ibuprofen. I was able to check my temperature. I had a 101-103 degree fever.  The entire next day (Tuesday) I took ibuprofen every six hours. My body was still very weak and aching everywhere as well as a headache. I stayed in bed the entire day. Today (Wednesday) I feel much better??both of my arms still ache a lot and my body feels exhausted.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after injection, I woke up after sleeping for an hour with excruciating pain in all of my limbs, especially the injection site. I could not move any of my limbs. Not because of pain, I simply could not move them. I had a fever (temp not recorded, I could only tell because I was burning up.) I was very nauseous, but never vomited. I was shaking very hard and had the chills despite being covered by a blanket and simultaneously burning up. Both of my ankles that I had suffered a running injury to several weeks ago (I have an upcoming doctor&#39;s appointment to get them checked out) were pulsing with pain. I developed a minor headache. Eventually I either drifted back to sleep or stayed awake, because I don&#39;t remember anything up until around 5am when I was able to get up and take Tylenol and water. All symptoms were gone except for the minor headache.

                                                After about 4 hours of having the shot, I got extremely light headed and nauseous. About the same time I got really bad chills and was shaking aggressively from the cold and got very bad pain in my joints, back, neck and injection site. My skin felt very sensitive and hurt to touch.  I took medication and felt a little better but was unable to eat due to the nausea. A few hours later I still had very sensitive skin and nausea but I was very hot and couldn?t cool off. The following morning at about 8am on April 9 I woke up with hives on my ears, back of my neck up to the top of my head and the center of my chest. I still had severe body pains and my hives spread throughout the day to my face, inflating my forehead, nose and lips. I was still unable to eat because of the nausea and I was still taking ibuprofen which usually eliminates my hives. My body pain, nausea and hives stayed consistent the entire day despite taking the proper medication precautions. At about 12:30am on April 10 I checked my temperature at 100.3 degrees. At 2:30am it dropped to 98.9 degrees. The first meal I was able to eat was at about 7:30am on April 10 while take over the counter anti-nausea medication. It?s currently about 5:15pm on April 10 and most of my hives have reduced to redness, my body pain and injection site pain is still consistent and my nausea has barely reduced.

I experienced these cold like symptoms throughout the night.  At around 6:00 am, I woke up with a very mild headache and muscle aches.   I took my temperature, and had a 101 degree Fahrenheit fever. I rested, and took my temperature multiple times that morning-- which had been gradually decreasing. At around 11:30/12:00 I experienced a sudden onset of extreme fatigue followed closely by a greatly reduced ability to hear and see, along with extreme lightheadedness and the feeling like I was going to pass out. I suddenly became cold, and my body was drenched in sweat in a matter of seconds.  I think the whole experience lasted around 10 minutes, before it eventually began to pass. I could see clearly again  and began to regain my hearing, however I still experienced some lingering auditory complications for an additional three- five minutes ( it sounded like a throbbing white noise). After that, I felt a little disoriented and tired. My aunt had taken me to Urgent Care, but they turned me away, saying I needed to go to the ER. However, by that time my symptoms had passed and I was feeling ok. So I went home and rested. By the next morning, I felt I had completely recovered

                                                I got the vaccine at 3:45 arm was sore but I wasn?t worried Later that night around 6 I started feeling disgusting from vaccine so I took an Advil.  Around 8-10pm my body started getting chills, I started shaking, I had a headache my muscles were sore, and I started getting a fever. Around 12am all of the previous symptoms got worse my fever was at about 101 and rising and I was extremely tired. At 1am I felt the worst I have ever felt in my entire life. I could barely walk because my muscles and joints hurt and my fever was over 102.5 and I felt like my veins were on fire. At 2 am I moved to my bathroom because the floor was cold and I didn?t want my roommate seeing me cry from how much pain I was in. I have a high pain tolerance but this was the worst pain I?ve ever been in. In the bathroom I was at the peak of the pain of the vaccine. My fever was over 103 all of my previous side effects were worse than ever I felt weak and a little dizzy. I also was having a hard time breathing, my breathing was weak and I felt like I wasn?t getting enough air. I tried looking up on my phone if I should go to the hospital but I could barely pick up my phone to type or look. I dropped my phone and fell asleep in the floor for 20 minutes before I woke up. I walked slowly over to my bed and took a Tylenol and then had a sip of water and felt like I was going to puke. I tried to use my inhaler and I couldn?t hold my breath to use it. I crawled into bed and slept until 11 the next day and was too sore to walk to class all of my joints still hurt and I had a fever of 101 and a headache . I took a Tylenol and around 6pm my fever broke and I was feeling better. The next day I was still too sore to walk to class and had a headache. Today I am still sore but better my lungs still feel a little tight, I feel unfocused , and I still feel dizzy occasionally. I have no appetite and I feel nauseous when I eat so I?ve been eating in smaller portions . Every single day since the shot I?ve felt very tired. I hope these symptoms get better and Looking back on the night of vaccine I should have gone to the hospital.

The pharmacist brought her into the immunization room and had her sit with her feet up on a 2nd chair. Gave her a bottle of water and sat with her until she felt better.

Felt these symptoms from about 4:00 PM until about 11:00 PM when I went to sleep. The next morning, 24 hours after receiving the vaccine, my head still ached/throbbed, and my back still felt incredibly awful. My left shoulder was also still very sore. As of now, almost 60 hours after the vaccine, the only symptom still remaining is the very sore shoulder. I cannot extend it fully without immense pain, but it still hurts otherwise.

                                                Around 5:00 PM the day I got the shot I started to get a slight headache. Shortly after the headache appeared I started to get the chills, I was wrapped up in multiple blankets and started shaking uncontrollably. I then checked my temperature and at this time it was 100.3. I then ate dinner and decided to try and fall asleep. When I lied down my heart began to beat very fast. I tracked my heart rate via a watch and my resting heart rate was around 140 bpm. My fever had also increased to 102. My head ache continued to get worse and I began to have bad neck and lower back pains. I was also having muscle spasm in my calfs. The entire night I could barely sleep because of my high heart rate, body aches, shakes, and the constant change from freezing cold to hot and sweating.

                                                She felt totally fine after the shot and many hours after.  She felt fine to go to a horseback ride lesson at 4.  Half way through the lesson she acutely felt like she was going to faint/nauseous (she had a ton to eat that day, had a bottle of water just before lesson, etc. so she knew it wasnt those kinds of things) and then had a crushing headache with a lot of &#34;pressure behind her eyes&#34;, dizziness, and a really &#34;strange&#34; feeling like out of body, bawling crying, and started FREEZING.  I got there 15 minutes later and she was under lots of blankets, white as a sheet, freezing, said her spine was sore from the top to bottom... just tons of symptoms.  When I got her, she moved to my car and had seat heater on high and I had to put all the clothes from a suitcase I had in my car on top of her bc she was so cold and her skin was burning up.  I gave her 3 200 advil and a bottle of water.  ½ hour later i had a thermometer and even after that she still had 102.3 fever.  She was rambling some nonsense and seemed very disoriented for a while. She went straight to shower and laid on the floor of the shower for ½ hour, took cold medicine, and evnetually went to sleep.  In the night she was freezing again and the fever had spiked and she took more advil.  The next day she felt much better in the morning and fine by lunchtime.  She was VERY sick/uncomfortable with basically every symptom under the sun.

                                                Around 10:00pm, I developed a fever and chills. The chills lasted for about two hours until I was just left with the fever until I fell asleep around 2:00am. The next day, I woke up with neck and head pain which disappeared after a couple more hours of rest until 11:00am. Afterward, that day, I had a slight headache which eventually disappeared sometime late in the evening around 9pm. The following day after the shot (second day later), I felt completely normal.

Went to two urgent care that would not see her.  Went to Med center. She had severe back pain and ringing in her ears at this point. They left her in a room for 30 minutes to go consult with a doctor after she told them she had the J&amp;J vaccine. They came back and told her she had fluid in ear from pollen and back pain was caused from the chills and shaking. She still has a sharp pain in her ear and ringing in ears is still present.

The shivering is so intense it essentially renders the patient in a state of involuntary writhing; muscles across the body, even if not in movement, may be tensed to the point of pain. Muscles affected lie in the legs, arms, and torso. An observer might mistake the event for a seizure, though the patient is fully conscious for the duration. The episode lasts only a few minutes; such an episode has only occurred once.

                                                She got her J &amp; J vaccine around 4:30 on April 7th ,2021.  She was feeling fine up until around 10:00 that night when she began to have some of the regular side effects in addition to some unusual ones that were more concerning.  She had chills was feverish and nauseous with flu like symptoms of her body aching.  However, at around 10:30 that night she reported having difficulty breathing and having chest pains with pain when she would take breaths. She noticeably was taking very small but frequent breaths due to the pain. She described a pressure on her chest as if there was a bowling ball sitting on top of her chest. She was crying from the pain and her difficulty breathing. She also reported that her throat felt like it was smaller/ constricted.    At that time, she was given Acetaminophen and later around 12:00 she was given Benadryl.  When she went to bed that night, she was in pain but she also reported that her heart was racing and her resting pulse at the time was 110 bpm. She had the flu like symptoms into Thursday evening but by Friday she looked a lot better except for her difficulty breathing with complaints of chest pain when she breaths with continued pressure on her chest.  She rested in bed for most of Friday and on Saturday she got dressed in the afternoon and took a walk around half a mile at which time she was exhausted and felt out of breath.  When she walked back from her destination about a half mile, she needed to rest in bed to recuperate.  The pain while breathing lasted into Sunday. Monday morning, she attempted to run and became winded from running a short distance of ¼ of the block and could not catch her breath having difficulty breathing and throwing up with a lot of subsequent chest pain that day. She was taken to the doctor by 10:00 that morning to run lab tests and get an examination.  She is slowly getting better and taking it easy but Tuesday she still had some pain and by Thursday she is reporting that while the chest pain is still there it is more of a discomfort that she feels when breathing as compared to pain.  She continues to report the discomfort when breathing till today 4/16/21 and is still limiting her physical activity but going about her daily routine.

About eight hours after injection, a fever and fast heartbeat accompanied by chills began and persisted for about twelve hours. A few mild and extremely brief feelings of nausea were present as well. After taking Tylenol six hours in, the symptoms started improving and were gone after seven hours. Feelings of tiredness were present for about two days after the first symptoms showed up.

                                                The patient was sitting in the waiting area following her vaccination when shortly after receiving the vaccine, her mother flagged us down and said that she lost her vision. She was describing feeling unwell. I had her lay down on the floor in the immunization booth and her mother elevated her legs. I asked her to describe her symptoms and she said that she just saw all white. I asked if she wanted me to check her blood pressure and I had her sit up on the floor and it was low around 75/53 with a pulse of 53 but not sure how accurate it was since she was sitting on the floor. She fluctuated from starting to feel better and feeling unwell again and her vision going out again. I asked if they wanted me to call 911 and her mother said she wasn&#39;t sure what to do, if she should take her to an urgent care. I said that it would be best if she was seen in an emergency room where they can better respond to this kind of situation. The patient was able to get up and walk with her mother&#39;s assistance. I was going to help walk her out but she said that she was okay walking out with her mother&#39;s help. About 10 minutes later, I called the patient to see how she was doing. Her mother said that she was doing okay and that they were on their way to the hospital just to make sure that she was checked and everything was okay.

I couldn&#39;t get a reading on the BP monitor at that time as it was too low to read and she couldn&#39;t move her limbs. While waiting  for EMS she could breathe fine, I could feel a faint pulse, but I had to keep taping her leg and talking to her to keep her awake. She was able to tell us her name and how many fingers I was holding up. I kept trying to get her to squeeze my hand, but I could only feel the tips of her fingers twitching and the whole time she was unable to move her feet/toes. I was able to look at her HR on her watch right before EMS arrived and it was at 62 and by that time her body temp seemed to be back to normal as her Mom said she felt cool and clammy. The BP reading by EMS was 100/60 and they tried to get her to stand but she couldn&#39;t and she still kept wanting to roll her head back and sleep.

The next morning, at 08:00 am, I woke up to abdominal pain right under my sternum - and it lasted until 08:00 pm that night - it came and went throughout the day but was pretty much over by that night.. I went to Urgent Care. I took Tylenol for the abdominal pain as they did not know the cause of it. I was very tired until Thursday of that next week.

By 9:00pm I was unable to move the left side of my body, had sharp pains throughout my body, and involuntarily urinated and vomited. This continues until 12:00pm Friday, the vomiting and urinating involuntarily stopped but the high fever, body pains, and numbness continued until Sunday evening. Now I still am experiencing random sharp pains and numbness on the left side of my body to the point where I cannot move it at all. I am throwing up occasionally (which has never happened before), and I have had a headache and insomnia since I got the vaccine. Pains behind my eye, loss of appetite and weight loss have occurred since.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Symptoms started yesterday, March 9th, with muscle aches in my lower back a couple hours after receiving the shot. The muscle aches spread throughout my body as time went on, and joint pain and headaches came as the muscle aches worsened. I took two ibuprofens, though they had no effect. A bit later in the day, I developed a fever and felt very nauseous. When I went to sleep, I had a hard time staying asleep and ended up vomiting when I woke up at around 1:00AM. Today, March 10th, I continue to have muscle aches, joint pain, a headache, and slight nausea.

It started going down at 4:00am after taking 1000 mg naproxen and Tylenol. Fever came back around 1:15pm today at 100.7 and has been up to 101.7 as of 5:30pm. The fever has come along with relentless shaking due to the chills. A migraine has also persisted despite taking NSAIDs to help with that as well.

I never fell fully asleep and began feeling worse at 11:00 PM. I had a fever of 101.5 F, chills, muscle spasms, anxiety, shortness of breath, and could not stop crying. This lasted until approx. 4 AM when I finally fell asleep. The next morning I woke up feeling much better. But, for the next 5 days, I have had on-and-off low-grade fevers between 99F and 100F.

Roughly an hour to an hour and a half later, the chills/shaking stopped, only to be replaced by a fever. My temperature shot up, my ears began to ring, and my head began to pound. When I tried to eat, I felt sick to my stomach.   My fever lasted for the entire evening, and I spent most of the night alternating between chills and heat flashes. My head continued to pound, and whenever I tried to sit up, I felt dizzy. At around 4am, I awoke with an upset stomach, diarrhea, and further dizziness.   By around 8-9am, my fever had subsided, and I was beginning to feel a bit better. However, I have been feeling physically drained and a little achy today (03/26).

                                                Within a few hours of getting the vaccine started with Flu symptoms of severe body aches, chills, headache, fever. Day 2 a bit better but still low grade fever of 101 degrees, nausea, weak, body aches but not as bad. In the evening around 5pm noticed ears starting to enlarge but didn&#39;t think much of it, by morning today at 7:30am I felt my face was swollen and numb on the right side. Now both ears were swollen and the area in my face was red. When I took my temperature on my forehead I was normal however the swollen cheek was 102 degrees. At that point I went to urgent care to get it looked out.  Currently at 6:30pm on 4/3/2021 the redness in my cheek has turn back to normal however the face is still swollen but not as bad.

                                                I began to have a high heart rate about hours after getting the shot then a fever came along and I had chills, and my lips were dry and I also had a headache. My heart rate  would barely stay below 100 BPM, even when laying down in bed. I developed a 102 F fever last night and took motrin, which helped lower it but I?ve also been having lingering throbbing headaches. My heart rate went to about 100-105 when while I took a nap but as soon as I got up and moved it jumped to 117, in the morning I went to use the bathroom and did nothing else and just that made it jump to 160. I have no trouble breathing. I was sitting in bed eating and my heart rate was around 123-130

                                                She had no history of anaphylaxis from any cause, she had no history of reactions to vaccines or components.  After about 5 minutes I checked on her and she said she was feeling very dizzy.  I called management for assistance and got her ice packs for neck and forehead. I took her blood pressure and it was 150/90, HR 73. We laid her down and elevated her legs.  She said that she felt some pressure in her chest but she had pulled a muscle there the day before and wasn&#39;t sure if it was related.  She said the room was spinning as she continued to lay on the ground and it was not improving.  Her blood pressure was taken about 5 minutes later and it was 143/85 HR 73.  She said it is usually low.   She had no signs of local reaction, hives, or swelling.  She complained of nausea.  After a few more minutes she said she was not feeling any better and was having pain in her throat and difficulty breathing.  I asked her to try to take a deep breath and she was gasping for air, unable to breathe deeply.  I administered epinephrine (one dose) and called 911.  I rechecked blood pressure while waiting for paramedics and it was 125/80.  She was taken to hospital when they arrived.  Her mom arrived shortly before the ambulance and went with her.  Pt never lost consciousness.  Management followed up with patient this evening and patient is home and well, but the ER did classify the event as an allergic reaction.

It started off with a slight headache and body aches with pain in my injection spot. My whole body started to shiver uncontrollably. My body aches focused on my spine and I started to become dizzy and nauseous. Around 4:00 am, the worst migraine, I have ever had that encased my whole head, lasted for about 12 hours with hot flashes. After the migraine, my body and head is sensitive to rapid motion and loud noises.

                                                Within the hour after receiving shot, migraine formed along with fatigue. Both progressively got worse through out that day(4/7/21). On 4/8/21 I woke up many times through out the night with a migraine that felt as though my brain was burning and sinus pressure, causing immense eye sensitivity. Throughout the night I became increasingly more sweaty, but didn?t have the proper thermometer to take my temperature.  I took ibuprofen (at 6:45 AM on 4/8/21) which helped those two side effects subside (around 8 AM). Fatigue has been constant throughout both days. Around 5:00 PM on 4/8/21 I ate broccoli and rice for dinner, small amounts, and encountered bad diarrhea. It lasted for about half an hour. Migraine is reduced significantly (at 6:41 PM), but there is slight nausea, weakness, and fatigue.

I tried falling asleep but my fever got worse, chills worsened, I developed body aches, and I got a massive headache. I ended up not being able to get any sleep at all during the entire night because I was in so much pain. I felt tightness in my chest, stomach pains, super sore joints, and my body aches and headache kept getting worse and worse. When I got up to go use the bathroom I could barely walk because I felt so weak and was super dizzy. Later into the night my legs felt like pins and needles as if they were starting to go numb. I still have a fever, body aches, and a headache.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Immediately after getting the vaccine, I experienced severe nausea for 10-20 minutes. I experienced no symptoms for 3-4 hours afterward, but then began to develop a low-grade fever,  muscle aches, a headache, and became nauseous again.  Around 12 hours after getting the vaccine, I developed a fever of 102 F, I began to experience severe muscle aches and cramps in my calves and abdomen. I also began to develop a much worse headache and lost partial vision in my right eye for a few hours. This is when I became violently nauseous, but I was unable to throw up, or defecate.  I was unable to sleep during this time, and at 2 am, my nausea peaked, and I threw up incredibly violently and incredibly suddenly. It was so violent, it caused me to pop a blood vessel in my eye, and gave me a sore throat. However, after throwing up, most of nausea subsided.  At this point, the vision began to return to my eye. 20-40 minutes after throwing up, I began to experience chills that lasted for up to an hour. Eventually, I slept at 4 am, but slept fitfully, and woke every 40 minutes to 2 hours.  At 7 am on the 9th, the nausea was completely gone the day after my vaccination, but the muscle aches and headaches were back. My fever was down to 101, and I took some Tylenol and slept fitfully until 2 pm when I woke up feeling significantly better.

                                                My school, hosted a clinic and pressured students to receive the vaccine, threatening them with an email saying we may not be able to return to school the next semester if we did not receive the vaccine in the next day and a half. I felt extremely dizzy after recieving the vaccine, and I&#39;ve never felt like that after any shot before, sho I was concerned. Within five hours, I started feeling really weak, and I developed a fever. In an hour, my fever rose to 104, my hands and feet were blue, and I felt so cold my fingers and feet were numb. I couldn&#39;t breathe, and I started coughing every time I took a deep breath. My entire body ached and I had stabbing pains in my abdomen. This was the worst pain I had ever felt in my life.

She states she developed numbness in the left cheek starting on 4/9/21.  For reference she says the vaccine was given in the left arm.  The numbness comes and goes.  I encouraged her to register for VSAFE and report her symptoms and to notify us if anything else develops.

                                                I woke up with a headache at 7:30 am and a dry mouth. I got out of bed to get my water bottle, which exacerbated the headache. I tried to go back to sleep but kept waking up to drink water every half hour or so, until 10:18 am. I got out of bed to fill my now-empty waterbottle. The headache rotated and became more intense as I got up. I could only walk very slowly and tried to keep my eyes closed. Around 12:00 pm I took one tylenol. The headache is still present. It is not located in any specific part of the brain but moves around depending on if I&#39;m sitting, standing, or laying down. During that time I also felt nauseous, but I no longer do.

                                                Mild symptoms began around 4:30pm (nausea, chills, headache, fever of 101). I took a nap around 7:00pm and when I got up around 8:30 my fever was 102. It continued to go up until it hit 104.6 around 9:00. My chills were gone, I was a little achy and had a headache, and was unconsciously crying even though I was experiencing very little pain. I took some Tylenol, and it went down to about 101 at 10:00pm. It stayed around 101 for most of the night and was back to normal by morning. We had called the hospital and they said there&#39;s nothing they can do for vaccine symptoms, but I thought I should report the high temperature.

However, about an hour later I was experiencing full body aches. This was eventually followed by chills, aches and pains, a cough, and a fever. These symptoms went away around 1 am that night of April 10, 2021. Then they returned around 3 pm the following day. Then went away again around 8 pm.

My friend told me that my forehead was puffy (swollen). I laid down and I realized I was really really cold but skin was hot to touch. I think I had a fever.  I was shaky and shivery and trembling. I tried to take a nap. Fell asleep for an hour - don&#39;t remember that time at all - but my friend told me I went to sleep. My smart watch was telling me my heart rate was 120s and 130s while I was sleeping. I debated whether I should go to the Dr. and I called the school police and they took me to the ER   - at 03:00 am on the 8th - and they told me to rest for  day and wait it out. I still feel like I have a lot of adrenaline - my watch says that my heart rate is way to high for what I&#39;m doing. It&#39;s usually in 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s but it&#39;s in the 120&#39;s and 130&#39;s every day and I am really shaky with adrenaline. I have had a headache since Wednesday night and it hasn&#39;t gone away. If it goes past Wednesday, I will go to my primary care doctor but otherwise no treatment at this time.

Woke up every half hour to an hour after that until about 8am. Experienced chills until about 10am. The body aches lasted until about 10pm of the same day, getting less and less severe as the day went on. The headache lasted until about 11:30pm. I took two Aleve to help with the headache around 12pm and it helped fairly well, although it still lingered. I felt nauseous for periods of 5-30 minutes about throughout the day, about 5 or 6 times total. I went to sleep that night and woke up this morning feeling normal besides being slightly tired.

                                                Jansen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA The first side effect began at 4/10/21 ~9:00 PM, approximately 6 hours after injection.  The very first noticeable symptom was chills. As the night progressed, chills came in cycles while headache and an abnormal sensation in the head became apparent. Throughout the night, there was also a feverish feeling, body aches, periodical sweating, and sore arm at injection site. I?ve experienced all these symptoms (except the sore arm and sweating) while being sick with Covid-19 approximately over a week prior to the vaccination. Symptoms continued until the next day, 4/11/21, and they gradually went away as the day progressed and after taking doses of acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Symptoms completely dissapeared by the evening of 4/11/21.

                                                Received the vaccine at around 7:15pm. Left the vaccination site and about 2 hours later experienced extreme tiredness and extreme head pain. Head pain progressed and got worse and worse. A fever was present by 3am (99.0) and went up every hour reaching the highest of 102.7. I experienced violent chills and shaking, extreme nausea, extreme muscle aches and pains, extreme light sensitivity, dizziness, lethargy, and extreme weakness. I took extra strength Tylenol every 6 hours to control fever and other symptoms. All symptoms subsided within 24 hours, except for headache, tiredness and aches and pains. All symptoms went away by 8pm on 4/13/2021.

                                                A few hours after I got home from getting the shot, my lower body started to ache super bad. My skin started to hurt like I had rug burn, but I wasn&#39;t surprised because that happens to me when I get the flu. My legs and groin region started to hurt more and more and I got the chills. It was extremely bad and I was sort of writhing but I told myself I was overreacting. At around 8 or 9, I decided I would sleep it off and went to bed. At 1:00 am, I got up to use the bathroom and I began feeling lightheaded. I thought I had just stood up to fast so I continued. As I walked, i got more and more dizzy and I couldn&#39;t hear well. When I sat on the toilet, I realized I wasn&#39;t going to be able to get back up, so I sat and waited. I started to get super hot so I took my shirt off. I finally was able to get up and walked towards the sink but I collapsed before I got there. I started drinking the sink water and ran my shirt under the water and put it on my head to cool off.  This really helped so I went back to my room to call my mom. I have never fainted before or come this close to fainting. For the rest of the night I had the worst migrane of my life that gave me aura in my left eye and made my left arm and left side of my face go numb, as well as pulsing in my head. The pain on my skin, and in my legs and head was still there for two days after but it was manageable enough for me to go about my day. I tried to exercize to ease the muscle pain but this did not work.

                                                On 4/8/2021 I developed a headache after receiving the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I took the next few days easy, and laid in bed for the majority of the weekend. On 4/10/2021 I left my residence to get dinner and noticed I was short of breath just walking from the building to my car. The shortness of breath worsened over the next few days. On 4/13/2021 I called a clinic and told them I had been short of breath and they directed me to the ER. I arrived to the ER around 2:30 in the afternoon. They ordered a chest x-ray and ran a test to determine if I could have a blood clot. The test came back with results indicating I could have a blood clot, so they did a chest CT and an MRI. The chest CT showed a blood clot in my left pulmonary artery. They prescribed a blood thinner, told me to stop taking oral birth control, and discharged me.

                                                Pt&#39;s throat and tongue and jaw felt like it was swelling. She had extreme pain in her arm and her hands started swelling. She got a rash on her arms and on her hands. I took her to the urgent care facility and they gave her a shot of Decadron and a shot of Benadryl. They also Prescribed steroids. She was very sick like she had a severe flu. I was very worried as her mother. She was weak and slept constantly. Her arm could barely move and It almost appears as if she had had a stroke. She had brain fog and she wasn&#39;t remembering her days like she was missing memory. After five days, the reaction started up again so we took her to the emergency room. They did a variety of tests including a urinalysis, CT of the brain, ECG 12 lead, peripheral venous duplex of her upper arm. Everything checked out OK so they put her on more steroids and sent her home. Pt is still having arm pain a month later but finally feels better.

                                                First symptoms were fever of 103.5 at midnight on the 28th. I called the RA on call in my university department and they called PD - to come and make sure I was okay. For 36 hours, I felt terrible - couldn&#39;t do anything. About 1 1/2 to 2 weeks later, I started getting really severe back pain that made it hard for me to do things - even sitting in a chair caused so much pain or walking or standing for long periods of time made me light headed because it was intense pain. There was one instance, when I nearly passed out from the pain but I didn&#39;t as I called for help for someone to catch me. It kind of moves around - the pain - sometimes it&#39;s a along my spine and sometimes it&#39;s low below my shoulder blades. I&#39;m still having this pain. It&#39;s not on the same pain scale as it was a couple of weeks ago. It&#39;s more manageable right now. I do stretches and some medications and there are a couple of patches  - Salontas - that my dad uses that he recommended I try to use for backaches. I am calling my doctor today to make an appointment.

I told the patient to put her head between her knees. She regained color within minutes. She felt better but we called 911 just to be safe. The patient and the EMT decided the she would be driven home bu her mother to rest.

She woke up around 1:00 am on 5/27/2021 with numbness/tingling/pain in the left arm and in both legs. She states &#34;it hurts to even stand on my legs&#34;.  This has persisted all day and is not getting better. She has contacted her PCP and the pharmacy and they informed her to call us. Other symptoms include headache, jaw pain, dizziness body ache (mostly lower back) and cough. None of these symptoms are normal for her.

A minute later she said she felt like she was going to pass out.  She leaned against the wall and her eyes started to close.  I noticed that she was starting to break out into a sweat.  I asked it she was having trouble breathing, if her throat felt like it was swelling or if she felt nauseous.  She said no, just dizzy and really thirsty and asked for some water.  I asked again if she was having trouble breathing or was nauseous and she said no, then passed out.  I took her blood pressure, which was normal.  After a couple of minutes she started to wake up, although not fully, and asked what happened.  I told her I had given her a COVID vaccine and asked if she remembered that.  She said yes then seemed to pass out again.  I then decided to call 911.  A minute later the patient woke up.  I asked how she was feeling and she said better.  After a minute she asked if she could sit up and I said yes, as long as she felt she could.   I took her blood pressure a second time.  By the time EMS arrived the patient was fully alert, we were having a conversation and she said she felt fine.  EMS checked her over but she refused to go to the hospital.  I had her sit a few more minutes while I filled out her immunization card.  When she left she said she felt completely fine.

                                                5 hours after the vaccine, I started having a sore arm at the injection sight and a low grade fever of 100.0 with chills and I was uncontrollably shaking. I took ibuprofen at 8:00pm. That night at about 9:00 my fever was 100.8 and I felt extreme fatigue.  I woke up at 3:30am feeling both extremely hot and cold with a bad headache and my temperature was 101.5. I took ibuprofen again at 3:30am. I then woke up at 5:15 am with a horrible headache and was very hot and sweating. I put cold compresses on my forehead and back of my neck which helped. The entire night, my arm with the injection site was very painful and stiff to move.

Lots of pain and soreness at injection site. Had a severe headache the next morning (relieved with acetaminophen), and had a difficult time seeing up close for about two hours despite using my corrective lenses, which made the headache worse.

                                                Patient received her vaccine with 2 family members in the room who also got the vaccine. Moments after (less than 2 minutes) giving her the vaccine, I was giving another family member the injection and patient asked if she could take her mask off. I turned around and she was very pale. She took her mask off and started slumping in her seat. She was taking deep breaths and reported no difficulties breathing. She then became ill and began gagging, at which point I gave her the trash receptacle to vomit in. I had a technician grab the patient a water and packet of crackers. After half an hour of resting in the chair, monitoring her breathing, blood pressure, heart rate, and getting some food and water into her system, she appeared and reported to feel back to normal. Patient&#39;s family member mentioned she had a similar reaction a few weeks ago when getting blood drawn at her doctor&#39;s office.

                                                Immediately after receiving vaccine, a cold, tingling, transient sensation was experienced radiating from the site of the injection up into the neck. Roughly 6 hours after injection (1 a.m., 3/9/2021) severe chills were experienced for approximately two and a half hours, preventing sleep. Patient experienced dizziness. spO2 was within normal limits. Temperature was measured w/ oral thermometer to be 101.3 degrees farenheit at 4:55 a.m. in the morning on 3/9/2021.  Treatment was a single dose of ibuprofen at roughly 8 a.m. (3/9/21). Pt. continued to experience fatigue and sporadic chills, with gradual abatement of symptoms over the course of the day. Pt. had no symptoms the following Wednesday (3/10/21). Pt. experienced symptoms the following Thursday (3/11/21), with a sudden onset of intense stomach pain (8/10 on NRS) starting at approximately noon. Stomach pain was more similar to muscle cramps (with aching quality) than nausea. Other symptoms included fatigue and some feverish experiences (such as chills). Treatment was conservative (ginger tea, peppermint candies, rest). Temperature taken that evening via oral thermometer (roughly 7pm, 3/11/21) was 101.4 degrees farenheit.  Symptoms were significantly reduced the following morning, Friday 3/12/21. Temperature taken approximately 10 a.m. was within normal limits.

Today I am still extremely fatigued and have a bad headache and dizziness. This was not relieved by the maximum dose of Tylenol.

I went to the walk in clinic at CVS on Saturday because I was still feeling fatigue, headache, nose bleeds (I was having them before the vaccine about a week before) and sinus congestion, they antibiotics and I was able to get started on them on the same day. I still feel the fatigue, congestion and the sinus pressure/headache. The fever and chills are gone.

                                                The first night I had a severe headache, but it was gone the next day, had no symptoms until yesterday, March 18th, after waking up with a huge rash all over my upper thighs and stomach, and the next day, March 19th, it had spread to my arms, and further down my legs, and is starting to spread to my face. No rash has appeared at the injection site, which led me to believe this wasn&#39;t a result of the vaccine, but I have made any behavior or diet changes, and have no known allergies, so the only thing I could think to cause the rash was due to the vaccine. I am not saying at all that this means I regret getting the vaccine, I just thought it would be responsible of me to report these symptoms, in case others were experiencing a delayed rash and was concerned. The rash hasn&#39;t caused any distress other than existing, there&#39;s no itching or pain from it, it just keeps spreading fairly rapidly.

The lightheadedness was such that my heart was pounding, vision was lost for a second (similar to the effect when you stand up too fast), and the sound went out for a second. Around 7:00 I got chills, a 101 degree F fever, and headache. The chills, fever, and headache lasted throughout the night, but they were gone in the morning. The entire day after getting the vaccine, 4/1/2021, I had a metallic taste in my mouth. By the morning of 4/2/2021 the metallic taste was gone.

                                                It started with my teeth chattering and chills, but no fever yet. All of the muscles in my body had a severe tremor, and I had trouble with simple tasks like filling my nasal rinse bottle, because the tremor was so bad. My jaw was smacking the entire time, so hard that the headboard smacked against the blinds. Then I checked my temperature and it had gone from 97.5 to about 99.5. The symptoms got worse, and added in excessive thirst, pain at the base of my head where it meets my neck, pressure under and behind the eyes, severe lower back pain, muscle pain escalating on the right side of my body only, nausea, pain across the top of my forehead, and a weird heat sensation under my fingernails? Maybe and hour or so passed, and my fever rose to above 101, and I tried to go back to sleep. By this point the tremors were over, but slight chills and every other symptoms remained. I took my temp later and it was 102.7, and I again had all symptoms except the initial tremors. I also had tachycardia (super rapid heartbeat) and got dizzy for a second and have a little trouble focusing my vision when I sat up in bed.

We called 9-1-1 to check vitals and they recommended going to her doctor or the hospital in case of additional swelling.  We called the doctor and they told us to try Benadryl.  This worked a little bit, but she is still in a lot of discomfort today (Saturday after Thursday shot).

                                                2-3 days following the vaccine, a series of small hives appeared along the left side of body.  Specifically on the left shoulder and left hip. They appear as small bug bites and are very itchy. They are hot to the touch and only slightly risen.   Additionally, at around 10 hours following the vaccine, I experienced severe muscle aches and chills (but this was listed as a typical side effect).

Around 4:15 I had to lay down because I believe the shivering was exacerbating my aching.

I felt overall achy but still able to get up and do what I needed to do. Once I went to bed though, I woke up around 2:00a sweating, achy, and with a fever. I couldn&#39;t fall back asleep very easily and once I woke up around 7:00a I confirmed I had a fever. I am currently still bedridden with a fever, complete body aches, and slight feelings of nausea. As of right now it is 8:56a 04/06/21 and the symptoms haven&#39;t gotten any better. I haven&#39;t taken any medication since 04/05/21 at 6:15p ish, which was to treat my headache from yesterday.

When I woke up at 7 am I became very faint about 10 minutes after getting up and walking around; it sounded like I was underwater, I had tunnel vision, I could not speak coherently, and I was sweating. This subsided about 15 minutes after laying on the cold floor with a cold towel.  The faintness completely disappeared after an hour

                                                I began feeling a migraine at 3pm. I took a nap and woke up at 6pm feeling extremely ill. My temperature was 101.5F and my entire body was in pain. I took two Tylenol as suggested. Over the course of the entire evening, I was vomiting profusely; I vomited approximately 10 times. By around 10pm my extremities became numb and I could not walk without assistance. I could not think or speak straight. I nearly fainted every time I tried to sit up. I tried to take ondansetron for vomiting but proceeded to vomit the medication as well. I wanted to go in to the ER because I felt like I was dying, but I do not feel financially comfortable doing so. All symptoms remained consistent until about 3am when I was able to sleep until 7am. I woke up with several bouts of diarrhea, intense nausea, and head to toe muscle and joint pains, as well as numbness and tingling in my arms and legs still. It is now 5pm the next day and I still can&#39;t eat or stand for too long without feeling faint. I still have diarrhea and strong migraine.

                                                6-7 pm began a fever that lasted until the next morning. Did have a few moments of severe chills.  Minimal nausea and dizziness.  Sore joints, and entire skull hurt. Inner ears also hurt. Slept or 12 hours Headache was also present most of the day before the fever set in.  My period started the day before and usually I have heavy days first. I had a light day after my injection and today it&#39;s extremely heavy. So it messed with the flow.

                                                Last night (around 9:00 pm) I became very nauseous and had a severe headache, chills and nausea. I took 2 Tylenol pills and went to bed. At 11:00pm I became extremely ill with a fever of 103 F and vomited 4 times consecutively.  I went back to bed, still with a fever and chills. At 12:30 am (April 9th) I again started vomiting again (around 3 times).  I then went back to bed and fell asleep. I woke up around 8am (April 9th) still feeling feverish, with chills and a severe headache. I have no appetite and no energy to get out of bed as of right now (11:00am).

                                                Hives on my arms and stomach developed within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine at 2:16. I left the facility after 30 minutes because the hives did not get any worse and I did not experience any other symptoms. At home about 8 hours later, I started feeling exhausted, weak, and my body was literally shaking whenever I stood. Overnight, I felt feverish, I had the worst nightmares, and woke up every few hours. On Friday (next day) I felt dizzy whenever I moved, nauseous whenever I stood, and once when I was standing too long I started vomiting.  On Friday evening I went to a local ER (all the urgent cares were closed) at my primary care Dr?s suggestion to ensure that I wasn?t having an allergic reaction to the vaccine. The ER determined that the hives were likely an allergic reaction but all other symptoms were reactions due to the vaccine.

                                                Began with a head ache and slight dizziness followed by shaking/chills, after a while with those side effects I took ibuprofen. Later that night I had a fever, body aches and I woke up nauseous in the middle of the night. Other than being very tired and sleeping very late the next day all side effects subsided by Sunday March 14th.

                                                About 3 hours after vaccination, intense headache began. My head felt like it was being pounded with a hammer, and the pain was so intense it traveled down from my forehead to my jaw bone. At around 3:00 pm on April 8, I began to develop a fever which first started at 100 degrees Fahrenheit. By around 5:00 pm, the fever had progressed to 102 degrees Fahrenheit, and the 700mg of Tylenol I had taken was not breaking the fever. I started to get body chills, muscle pain, joint soreness, and cold sweats. Again, Tylenol was not helping. I had no appetite and was having trouble keeping fluids down. Around 11:00 pm on April 8, I took more Tylenol and the fever began to break but did not fully break until 36 hours after the vaccination. It is now April 10 and I am starting to feel like myself again, but for a full 36 hours the pain was so intense that even a light sheet covering my body was painful.

Patient was breathing but was unresponsive. Pharmacist instructed store manager (also on scene) to call 911, and gently laid the patient on the floor. Within one minute the patient became responsive, and remained on the floor per instructions received from 911 over the phone. Shortly thereafter EMS arrived and assessed the patient. Patient refused to go with EMS for further medical assistance. She agreed to stay in a chair in front of the pharmacy for further observation for 30 minutes. After the 30 minutes lapsed, patient left the store under her own volition.

                                                My arm swelled up about 30 minutes after the injection near my shoulder. I started feeling pain in my forearm and the facility nurse gave me an ice pack. I stayed an hour after the shot and the nurse said I should be fine, so I went home. Around 10 pm I started having a really bad reaction, worse than normal flu symptoms. A fever of 102 and body chills that lasted for about an hour. Heart rate also consistently stayed above 130 bpm. I drank a lot of water and took an Advil. I then was advised to take a warm shower, and this helped bring my fever to a 99. After the shower, I became really nauseous and started throwing up. I was debating going to the ER. I also drank chicken broth and a lot of water and did not go to sleep until 4 am.  The next two days I had a low fever and bad muscle aches throughout my body, the flu symptoms ended in 4 days.

I briefly fainted, but I woke up about two minutes later. My mom finished driving me home, and my condition improved with rest over the following hours.

Patient states that she got the J&amp;J vaccine yesterday and then over night she had onset of severe lower back pain that is localized to her back, but can occasionally be felt in her buttocks area. She first noticed body aches prior to bed. She woke around 3am to use bathroom and had terrible headache and back pain. Headache had subsided, but the back pain has persisted. The pain is located along her lower back, bilaterally. Sometimes the pain is felt in her buttocks. Pain otherwise is localized. Pain is dull, but intense. She rates the pain as a 8 or 9/10. Pain can not be alleviated. She tried a hot pack, with no relief. Laying down increases the pain, and the pain is so severe that she is unable to move. She feels afraid to move the pain is so intense. She has noticed no other symptoms. All other symptoms from the shot have subsided. Patient also became nauseated while in the exam room.

                                                At about 8pm the night of the day I got the vaccination, I began to experience pretty bad muscle &amp; joint pains from my hips down to my ankles. I was also going back and forth between being very cold and very hot. I have not gotten a fever so far. The pain was so bad that I wasn?t able to sleep at all. The following morning, today, I am still experiencing pain in my hips, thighs, and knees, as well as a faint headache every so often.

                                                About 10 hours after receiving my vaccine- I became extremely ill. I had migraines, fever of 101, chills, nausea, tightness of chest, abdominal pain, difficulty with my stool / bowl movements, and body aches.  I could not move, and most effects subsided after laying in bed for two/three days straight. However, continuing up to today (three weeks later) I have still had tightness of chest/throat, bowl difficulties, and abdominal pain. I also noticed that for the past 2/3 weeks I have also had blood spotting with clots alongside my abdominal pain. It has not yet subsided.

                                                Started out with a headache and dizziness within a few minutes of the vaccine, along with nausea. I stayed put laying down with a lollipop and water bottle along with ice packs on me for about an hour until I was well enough they thought for me to drive back to my dorm. Once I started driving the headache was back but I was driving so I couldn?t do much. Almost pulled over because I was getting over whelmed but ended up making it back to my dorm. Once I got back I changed and laid down in bed hoping to fell better. Things started getting worse from there. Throughout the rest of the day my head ache and dizziness got worse to the point where I was pretty unsteady on my feet. Chills and body aches also started and progressed rapidly despite no fever.  My nausea was present in waves but eventually dissipated around 8 PM.  I tried to go to bed around 11 hoping to sleep off the symptoms. I began tossing and turning. My chills were really bad and it got to the point where my skin was so sensitive that the clothes I was wearing touching and rubbing against my skin were hurting me. I was so dizzy and light headed to the point where it didn?t matter if I was laying down or sitting up, I felt the same, extremely dizzy and lightheaded as if cotton were in my brain or as if it were working too slow. It was like trying to process thoughts through molasses. Then around 1:30 I couldn?t take it anymore and thought maybe a quick shower would help me to at least feel better so I could sleep. When I got in the shower I immediately knew things were worse.  My vision started going black at the edges and black spots in the middle to the point where at certain moments I couldn?t see. I was fighting to stay on my feet and conscious and it was hurting to breathe. I knew I needed to get help so I stumbled to my dorm and collapsed when I got in the doorway to my room. My vision was spotty, my chest was hurting and I could barely breathe.  My hands and feet went numb as well, I was shivering, and my body temperature was a little down to about 98.1 degrees Fahrenheit.   I was transported to a hospital via ambulance my vitals were normal except elevated heart rate and O2 and  was admitted at 2:40 in the morning. I received a chest x ray and  my heart rate was better.  The dizziness was under control by then. I was discharged at 4:50 in the morning.

                                                Around 5:00 PM after having gotten my shot, I arrived home from a drive down to meet my sister. Precautions were taken, masks were worn, safe social distance was maintained and I have no reason to believe any of the symptoms I experienced upon returning home were related to anything other than the vaccine, particularly since first that is how vaccines work and second one of my friends who was vaccinated at the same time as me at the clinic was going through similar pains.  It started as a discomfort in my intestines or possibly just below my stomach in general. I thought my pants were too tight but just in case I let my mom take over driving the rest of the way home. When I got to the house, I had about an hour of usable time left before I went into a complete state of delirium. We&#39;re not sure how high my fever actually got before my mom woke up and checked in on me at 9:00 PM, but after having pulled the covers away I registered at 102.5° F. I was screaming in a half-awake and half-asleep nightmare, trying to get someone to come help me and unable to get anyone&#39;s attention. I would, as a result, like to insist that it be added to recommendations to not be alone after getting the vaccine! For the whole first night! I believe that I genuinely could have died. My brain was melting for lack of more proper medical terminology, and I stopped being able to understand and speak my own first language in an incredibly confused state. This was entirely a result of two simultaneous factors: Fever and Chills. First, the fever made my skin ache. Wearing any clothing hurt. But once I took off my pants in exchange for some breezy shorts, I was covered in goosebumps and feeling frozen even though it was solidly in the 70s. I claimed under blankets and still couldn&#39;t get warm enough. The backs of my thighs were insanely hot in comparison to the fronts of them, so I just warmed my body under 3 layers of blankets trying to get the chills to go away. I did that for about four hours during which time I was basically constantly screaming incoherently.

                                                Johnson and johnson covid-19 vaccine eau  March 20th - allergic reaction to covid vaccine Johnson &amp; Johnson. Allergic reaction started approximately 2 minutes after receiving shot. It started with itching and redness on my arms and upper chest. After approximately 10 minutes, I knew something was wrong and I signaled an attendant. They immediately brought me over to the EMTs on site, where they looks me over and started drawing up IV Benadryl. In the time it took for them to draw up IV Benadryl and insert the IV, the hives on my chest started to turn into burning and ice sensations intermittently. As soon as they administered the IV Benadryl, the itching redness and hives on my arms went away within a couple minutes, and I was left with only redness on my upper chest. They felt comfortable with me getting a ride to the ER from my dad and not getting emergency transport. At the ER, they gave me pepcid and prednisone. About an hour and a half later, I started developing chest tightness and hives and redness on the side of my face. They decided to administer more Benadryl and start epinephrine. I was discharged a couple hours later.  March 22nd - I went back to the hospital, with complaints of severe stomach pain. The stomach pain lasted approximately 24 hours.  March 20th to march 26th - I experienced extreme fatigue. I was exhausted to the point where on Wednesday I took a ten minute shower and by the end of it I had to lay down again because I was shaking from exhaustion.  Symptoms improved slightly until April 5th where it started taking a turn for the worse.  April 5th - I started noticing black spots in my vision that wouldn&#39;t go away. They didn&#39;t move and they stayed in one spot for hours until I fell asleep and then they&#39;d be gone the next morning. They usually started around 8:00 or 9:00 at night. Sometimes a couple hours earlier. They came every day until Friday April 9th when they did not come.   April 5th to present - I also started noticing light-headedness, motion sickness when I stood still or sat in a chair, nausea, neck pain, and periods of muscle weakness in the neck. These symptoms have not stopped.  Friday April 9th around 6:45 p.m. I started having a bad migraine, I noticed in the bathroom at work my eyes were dilating over and over and over again rapidly. The pain was very high. I ended up leaving work early and going to the emergency room. While at the emergency room they treated my migraine with a cocktail of Benadryl, toradol, and compazine. It reduced the pain at the time, however it did not take away the migraine.  Friday April 9th to present - My migraine has continued from April 9th and is still happening. I have been having severe light sensitivity, sound sensitivity, and trouble reading. The rapid dilation of my eyes stopped April 10th, however my eyes stayed dilated until April 12th.  In addition to all of my other symptoms, there are others that I am not as positive are relevant. I have asthma and it has been worse over the past couple of weeks, it it is not usually worse this time of year. I&#39;ve been also been having quite a bit more light bruising than normal over the past two weeks and over the past one and a half weeks I have noticed red spots all over my skin. I was not sure if these red spots were normal or not because I do have them on occasion however these are darker than normal.

                                                Morning after vaccination (on 4/6/21), pt got diffuse intermittent headache which focalized later into the right temporal area daily for 3 weeks, which she calls 8/10 in severity. These headaches have been so severe to the point that it induces nausea and creates abdominal cramping. She has not as photophobic as before during her headaches, and nothing seems to alleviate it but water and tylenol (but that has little lasting effect). Prior to these headaches her migraines came once every 2 weeks and lasted 2-3 hours at a time, with a 5/10 severity that was bitemporal with more pronounced photophobia.

                                                I feel inclined to file this report in hopes that someone could study how receiving this vaccine affected my endometriosis. Please understand that I?m a proponent of vaccination and building herd immunity; however, women?s health is important and we have a right to be AWARE of ALL side effects. I?ve done my best to research this topic and was able to find very few sources on how COVID-19 vaccines impact menstruation. Aside from the lack of statistics, I found forums on social media platforms with women explaining how their menstrual cycles became irregular some way or another. I did experience the common side effects of fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, soreness, and fatigue. In addition, I experienced severe cramps, back pain, thigh pain, groin pain, and nerve pain associated with the sciatic and obturator. I?m happy to be vaccinated because my immune system is far from the best, but if I were to have known that I would be unable to walk from the pain radiating from my back, pelvis, and thigh I would?ve opted for Moderna or Pfizer. At this point in time, I would NOT recommend the Janssen vaccine to someone with endometriosis. At that, this vaccine should be nowhere near as political as it is! My healthcare providers should be more willing to validate my symptoms, rather than saving face with the validity of the vaccine. I was told since my menstrual cycle is irregular I must coincidentally be getting my period, BUT I have not experienced any bleeding nor even spotting. I have no idea what the vaccine did to my body, I have no clue why it would induce such severe pain. I?m glad that the ?normal? symptoms have subsided by the second day, but the nerve pain complicates walking long distance or carrying heavy objects. I think I?ll eventually make a full recovery in the upcoming days, but this experience was so frightening. I laid on the floor for hours crying after I vomited up everything I had eaten. I couldn?t sleep because I couldn?t bear to lay down for long durations of time- and by that I mean more than ten minutes. It genuinely felt like I was getting my period, but whatever it was led to no external bleeding. Again, I?m grateful for the scientists who dedicate their lives to such integral work. I just wish I would?ve known about what was internally happening to my body beforehand, I would?ve chosen a different vaccine.

                                                There were no symptoms until much later in the evening. Around 8:30 PM, I felt fatigued. A little later I had chills for about 30 minutes. Then I felt nauseous and went to the restroom down the hall (I was living in a dorm). I did not throw up, but I had a pounding headache which only got worse. I also felt very hot and the cold floor was welcoming. I laid on the floor in the bathroom but felt too awful to sit up. Someone found me in the bathroom around 10:00 PM and called campus safety, which came about 20-30 minutes later. She determined that she could not give me medication on the spot and that she had to take me to the hospital. We arrived at the ER around 10:45 PM. The nurses and doctor took my temperature and found I had a 103-degree fever. Because of my pounding headache, I couldn&#39;t hear very well. The doctor gave me a shot of 60mg of Toradol at 10:56 PM. He then gave me instructions to alternate tylenol and ibuprofen every 3 hours, increase my fluids, and only do activity as can be tolerated. I left the hospital around 11:25 PM with a huge headache, but better than when I initially walked in.

I instructed her to remove her mask, place her head between her legs and take some deep breaths. Before she had completely bent over she lost consciousness and began seizing.

I made sure she did not injure herself or fall out of the chair and when the event was over I called ED. I continued to monitor the patient until she was taken by paramedics.

                                                About 12 hours after the vaccine, I experienced excruciating pain in my head and body. My fever rose to 102 and stayed there for 36 hours after being vaccinated. I was also nauseous and was unable to keep food down until 48 hours after being vaccinated. I was taking both Tylenol and Advil, but getting sick almost instantly after taking them.

On Wednesday at 01:07 AM woke up to a terrible migraine, nausea, and cold sweats. Could not go back to sleep. On a scale of (least)1-10(most) was a pain level of 6 or 7.  I also could not stop shaking.  At 2:03 AM  developed a fever of 101.3 F. Sat in a cold lukewarm shower until the fever broke.  Was able to go back to bed.   Spent all of Wednesday inside. Migraine and nausea still present. Intensified with bright lights.

                                                Around 10PM I was on the phone and felt the body aches start. About an hour or so later it started to get pretty painful, my joints. I was trying to go to sleep and I started with chills. I had a heating pad and 2 blankets and was still shivering, I took my temp and it was 102.4F. I took some Tylenol and was able to sleep and woke up in the middle of the night sweating. Next morning I was again with 102.7F fever. I slept most o the day, and when awake I noticed the body aches were still present. Kept taking Tylenol. Next day my left ear started feeling to hurt and it felt like fluid. I decided to go get checked and that is when they told me I had an inner and outer ear infection. After meds were prescribed (oral antibiotics and ear drops) the swelling has been going down a lot and it is not as near as painful.

I was warmer than normal but did not have a full fever. I was extremely fatigued. Most of these symptoms subsided in about 24 hours with acetaminophen. I am still having occasional (every other day) mild headaches and shortness of breath, heaviness in the chest, and a couch that have persisted 5 days so far.

The chills lasted for around 4 hours, and eventually my fever went away with it. I shook so hard my back, and my joints started to ache. I couldn&#39;t sleep because I was having hallucinations from the fever and the pain would wake me up every hour, I also had a headache. The next day my back still hurts, my head still hurts despite medication, the shaking has subsided. Yet I&#39;m sweating, I&#39;m still very weak, I can&#39;t stand up without getting super dizzy or experiencing extreme fatigue. If I think of food I feel as if I&#39;m going to vomit just drinking too much water can make me ill.

                                                EXTREME FATIGUE, chills and fever of 101.5, upset stomach and wanting to get sick.  Got shot in afternoon and felt bad before bed, then was really hot, had extreme chills, had a fever, and upset stomach the next morning.  Stayed in bed for the day, was thirsty and really hot.  Within 24 hours I felt completely fine...but just felt hot still and then that went away after 2 days.

                                                I had chills and a fever starting at 5 pm the day of the injection and those broke sometime in the middle of the night. I experienced some stomach discomfort but was not nauseous. However, in the middle of the night, I went to drink water and after the smallest sip I threw up everything in me. When I would use the restroom to poop I would feel a large pressure in my head, but only then and I also experienced muscular pain in my back. I was able to relieve symptoms with Advil. The fever and stomach discomfort was over by 3 am on 3/28. The chills came and went until mid-day on 3/28 and I believe that was with help of the Advil. The occasional pressure in my head only lasted until mid-day 3/28 and the back pain did not go away until the morning of 3/29. Following the vaccine I felt very dehydrated and while I drink lots of water, I had to increase my intake to even more than normal and this feeling was over by the evening of 3/28.  As of today, 3/29 I feel back to 100%.

I had a bad headache and was achy, which I know were listed as possible side effects. A few hours later, I started to have a severe burning sensation all over my body. It felt similar to the sensation when your skin gets extremely sensitive to any touch, but was magnified 10x over, and was over every inch of my body. There was no rash, and I did not have a chill as though I had a fever, although my skin was warm to the touch. I took 2 500 mg tablets of extra-strength Tylenol, and the symptoms did not improve at all.

When I got up the next morning I had nausea all day and complete loss of appetite. My head hurt, my body was achy, and I fought throwing up all day on 4/3. When I woke up 4/4 my appetite wasn&#39;t fully there but I was feeling better. Now 4/5 and 4/6 I&#39;m feeling normal.

                                                Around 9pm was very tired with small headache. Went to bed at 10pm and laid there for an hour and a half with my head pounding and burning. I?ve never been able to feel a fever on myself?it was so high. I also had major chills the whole time. I?d get up and hydrate and took 2 Advil around 12:30pm as no sign of sleep was coming. I put ice packs on my hot head for an hour with no relief. Meanwhile my heart rate was steadily above 100 for the whole night until about 4am when my fever went down and I was able to sleep till 7am. I thought I was going to die it was so hot and painful and pounding. In the morning the fever is gone and I am extremely tired. Currently not recommending people get the vaccine.

                                                Headache that evening and that lasted for about two days. Around 11 PM that same night of vaccine - I had chills but no fever. The second and third day I was super fatigued. Everything was okay after that but a week and a half later I was receiving severe stomach pain and a little blood in my stool. That is what brought me to the ER on 23rd when I had the blood in my stool . I had a rash on the back of my thighs  and I had swollen lymph nodes on each side of my neck that started after that. I went to ER again last weekend and that ER was at another location - no tests were done there. They told me to take OTC Tylenol. I still have the swollen lymph nodes and the rash is getting better not completely gone.

                                                Started to feel woozy and weak at 5:30pm, headache with sore muscles starting at 6:30pm, went to bed at 7:30 when couldn?t stand up anymore. At 8:00 chills started, along with a feeling of all my muscles contracting , lost the ability for fine motor control and  fell asleep at 9.pm. Woke up at 12:45am covered in sweat feeling as if I was burning with a splitting heavy headache, had fever, don?t know temperature new house so no thermometer but it sucked. dunked head in sink. Legs could barely support me so I couldn?t go down the stairs for pain medication, went back to bed. Got cold washcloth at 1:00am pain felt pretty unbearable, couldn?t make it downstairs or move at this point so I spent night in and out of sleep unable to move. Muscles still feel like rocks and my head feels like it?s stuffed with a mixture of Vaseline and nitroglycerin, every time I move it feels like my brains smashing into my skull with little explosions. Recent development within the last 5-6 hours maybe?(3:00-4:00pm) centralized over my breast bone feels incredibly painful, hurts to breath and feels like something heavy is pressing it through my chest into my spine. Not sure what to do or if this is normal but it hurts really really bad. Accurate hours because I was lucidly texting my friends to make sure I wouldn?t pass out, so I have nearly exact hours when each symptom appeared till I could no longer use my fingers.

Stayed seated until it mostly passed, then went outside for fresh air and to cool down. Put a cold rag on forehead/back of neck for half hour following symptoms. Drank water at soon as possible. For the next 36 hours after receiving the vaccine: sensitive skin, muscle weakness, tiredness, headache, body aches (including the sight of injection), chills, hot flashes. Took Advil every few hours to reduce pain, kept lights off, laid in bed to rest.

I immediately grabbed another chair and raised her feet above her heart level. She immediately stated that she was &#34;feeling better&#34; and started regaining her vision. we then offered her a cold bottle of water. She appeared very stable within a few minutes. We did call 911 as a precaution, they arrived a while later and deemed the patient was stable and their additional services were declined by the patient. I insisted the patient stay and finish the bottle of water. All together I believe the event was about 30 - 35 minutes before leaving. I encouraged the patient to drink plenty of fluids and electrolytes and to take it easy for the rest of the day.

By 7 pm, the fever progressed to 103.7 deg F. By 11 pm, I started to have nausea. Throughout the night I continued to have chills and sweats with episodic vomiting. The next morning I had terrible body aches and restless leg syndrome. I still had a fever and a lack of taste. It wasn&#39;t until 48 hours after receiving my vaccine that my symptoms eventually subsided.

Fever, headache and nausea: I woke up an hour later with fever, mild headache and nausea. It lasted about 4 hours. I took 2 pills of tylenol and had a shower. Started feeling better afterwards but I was too tired because I wasn´t able to sleep. I was okay the whole day but too tired. Then, I got a fever and headache again around 6 pm. Fell asleep for around 3 hrs and woke up feeling better.

                                                Several hours after getting the vaccine, my back spasmed out and the pain was continuous and I still have the upper back pain today. That same evening I developed the chills, stomach pain. The next day I began experiencing a fever, headache, nausea, light headedness, dizziness, chills, back pain, lock jaw, some numbness on left side of face, zoning out or spacing out. My period also came two weeks early. I had some throat irritation as well as the feeling of being weak and some neck stiffness. All these symptoms seem to have gone away by Sunday evening, if not Monday morning. Except for the back pain, the nausea, and the throat irritation and some head pain and some numbness in face seem to have persisted.

                                                At 6:30PM, I developed a headache and took acetaminophen. It didn?t subside after taking that, and progressively got worse as the night went on. I began feeling chills and feverish before I went to bed. I woke up sweating in the middle of the night multiple times with my headache getting even worse. At 5:30am, I woke up and it was as its worst, with a 101.2° fever, sweating, chills, and an even worse headache that felt like a migraine.  The  headache lasted until the next morning and lingered throughout the entire next day, although not as intense as it was at 5:30pm. I?m still struggling with some on and off fatigue from the vaccine, and my arm is still sore.

                                                I had the typical soreness about 12 hours after the injection. No worries there. The next morning, on the 10th, around 11:40 AM, I started feeling extremely dizzy. The room started spinning. I was standing at the time, and I kept standing, but other than that, I had no control. My hearing starting going fuzzy, starting with ringing in my ears until it sounded like I was underwater. My vision started blurring, as well, eventually going completely black. For a solid 5-10 seconds, I could neither hear clearly nor see at all. I was conscious, because I could think relatively clearly, and I could feel my eyes blinking and could wiggle my fingers, but that was it. Once the episode passed, I immediately sat down. About a minute later, I started having excruciating abdominal pain. The pain was wracking my whole body, causing me to go pale (as I later saw once I could hobble to the bathroom) and making me sweat. After about twenty minutes, the whole thing passed and I was left with minor dizziness and slight nausea. Now, three days later, I still have some of the dizziness, but none of the blindness, deafness, or pain has returned. All other side effects, such as soreness, have completely left.

I started getting goosebumps. That lasted for about 9 hours throughout the night. I also experienced nausea for about 30 minutes at 8:45 pm. I felt like I was going to pass out within that time period too. My head was also hurting throughout the night. My body was aching through the night as well. The only reason I am not sure if I had a fever is because I did not have a thermometer. My arm was sore for 3 days and I was also sweating throughout the first night.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  The morning after getting the vaccine I woke up feeling very tired and sore/achey all over. I got to work (I lifeguard at the pool on campus) at around 6:15am and helped get the pool set up. When I sat down to try to do homework I started feeling very dizzy and nauseous. The pool deck is very hot, so I decided to try to go into the pool office where it would be cooler. I remember walking through the door and into the office, and then laying down next to the trash can because I thought I might be sick. One of my coworkers brought me some water and Goldfish, and I layed on the office floor for the rest of my 45 minute shift. Afterwards, when I was looking for my laptop, my other coworker said that when I had tried to go through the door into the pool office I had run into the door (I later got a small lump on my head from this) and that I had dropped my latptop. I do not remember either of these happening, so I believe that I blacked out for a moment, and it was likely hitting my head on the door that woke me up. A small scratch and some mild pain in my foot leads me to believe I dropped the laptop partially, but not completely, on my foot. I felt very tired for the rest of the day, and a little dizzy up until about mid-afternoon. I spent most of the day in bed sleeping. Waking up the next morning I felt completely fine, and was able to go about all of my normal activities with no side effects at all.

Following day it was still there, so we took her to the Emergency Room where after an abdominal cat scan she was diagnosed with mesenteric adenitis.  They gave her total to manage the pain and sent her home to let the symptoms subside hopefully after a few days.  Today she is better, but very tired.

I fell asleep at 9:30pm because I was so tired and woke up at 11:00pm feeling incredibly feverish, naseauish and weak. I couldn&#39;t stand in the shower I felt so weak. Then around 11:30pm I vomited all of the contents of my stomach. I didn&#39;t feel nauseous after I finished vomiting. The next day I still felt feverish and like I didn&#39;t have an appetite. I spend around 5 hours of the day sleeping. I felt more like myself by 7:00pm the following day.

No cough, no SOB, c/o chest pain on inspiration intermittently, more a sharp pain near the center just above the breastbone, not a squeezing or a pressure substernal  Took some APAP and took alleve 20 min ago  I adv that the body aches, N, HA all may be consistent with ADR to the vaccine and generally should be limited to a few days, ok to take OTC pain relievers but not in excess to bottle recommendations. Keep hydrated. Consider a hot pack. Watch the chest pain if this persists or worsens,  consider HCF evaluation, though given the body pain throughout and location of the pain may be muscular.

Ten days after the vaccine I was in the shower and a large blood clot came out of my nose. It was a large clot about the size of a quarter and there was no other blood with it. The clot came out of my left nostril but it was not like a nose bleed. I went to the Urgent Care but they did not do tests.

                                                The first symptom I experienced was a high grade fever that reached 103.5 degrees Fahrenheit. The fever lasted from 2:00pm on May 10th (the day it was administered) until 2:00 am on a May 11th (the early hours of the day after it was administered). Some weakness, as well as muscular soreness in the left arm persisted in the insuring days. The reason why I chose to report my experience is because something that I thought was abnormal happened. On the evening of May 15th, as I was putting on my pajamas, I noticed an irregular mass in my left breast. As I examined it further, I realized that this mass was not there previously and warning shots fired off in my head, immediately. I immediately asked my grandmother to do another examination of my breast, and she confirmed my suspicion that there was a foreign mass located above my nipple in my left breast. It was difficult for me to closely monitor this mass as it was difficult for me to think about it as it triggered emotional distress. I asked my mom to do an examination and she also noted the mass. A little more than a week later, I noticed that the mass shrunk. Since everyone in my family was on edge for nearly a week suspecting that a 21 year old female in their family could possibly have breast cancer, this caused my family to consult my grandmother?s doctor, and have her assistant contact me about what could potentially be happening. Her assistant spoke to me over the phone and communicated that it is important for me to have the mass formally examined and for me to receive a mammogram. She also mentioned that many women who have received the vaccine also noticed irregular lumps in their breasts after receiving the vaccine. I want women in my age range to be aware that they might notice lumps in their breasts after the vaccine and not to experience the same emotional distress of thinking that they have breast cancer when it could be inflammation occurring in their lymph nodes as a result of being administered the Covid vaccine.

A week later (5/03), singular hives began to appear on arms and legs, resulting in loss of sleep. Much worse the next day (5/04)- clustered hives accompanied with burning rash all over arms and legs. Benadryl anti-itch cream only enflamed them more. Vomited the next morning (5/05) and made an appointment with healthcare clinic, despite hives and rash subsiding overnight. Doctor ruled vomiting as an effect of prescription medication, but rash and hives as a result of a reaction to the vaccine. Next day and the day after,(5/06-5/07), had a few single hives appear on body. Haven&#39;t had any more appear since then, and I&#39;ve felt fine.

I got out an ice pack and put on the back of her neck and she leaned forward on another chair to try to get the blood to her head.  She started breathing heavier and complaining of her stomach hurting and not feeling well.  She was sweating and crying.  We called 911 and laid her on the floor with a cushion under her head until they arrived.  The patient continued to cry and complain of stomach pain and could not open her eyes.  She also had no strength to stay upright.  Her blood pressure was elevated at 163/100.  The patient was taken by ambulance to the hospital.

I then realized it was getting worse, and I was shivering uncontrollably despite sitting in front of a space heater in warm clothing and wrapped in a blanket. I checked for a fever, but my temp was only 99. I fell asleep around 1 am, and woke up at 5 am (3/8/21) to a splitting headache, extreme thirst, slight nasal congestion, muscle soreness, fatigue, and nausea. These symptoms feel almost identical to the symptoms I experienced when I contracted COVID-19 in September 2020 at my university.

Severe flu like symptoms (9 out of 10 on a pain scale, 10 being extremely painful): body aches and pains and low fever. Took both acetaminophen and ibuprofen to counteract the pains (did not help much). These symptoms lasted through March 9, 2021. Today is March 10, 2021 and my symptoms are feeling moderately faint and lethargic.

                                                Began with chills and muscle aches. Got worse over the course of an hour until I was unable to get out of bed. Pain in my muscles all over from hours of full body chills. The chills stopped after two hours at which point an uncontrolled fever set in. Highest temp recorded was 103. Severe full body muscle pain prevented me from getting up or drinking water on my own. Small movements like sitting up or rolling over to relieve muscle pain resulted in sudden and severe nausea. Considered going to a hospital to bring down the fever and hydrate. After two more hours of applying cold compresses, the fever decreased to 100 at which point I slept it off for six hours.  Prolonged bouts of dizziness, dehydration and nausea over the following two days.

                                                The night of my vaccine date (6 hours after) I was fatigued and started a fever with chills and acheyness which kept me in bed all night. I got up to shower and get some food as I was going upstairs I grew very faint,  my vision grew black and my hearing faded. I was able to make it to my bed then ask for some help. After taking Tylenol, my fever began to be very hot instead of chills. I was able to fall asleep until I woke back up to chills again and taking more medicine.  The next morning, I was still dizzy when I walked around but the fever was gone. I was still very fatigued which made me unable to go to class or work. Day 3 I was back to my normal self.

                                                Originally, I started with random muscle aches in my left shoulder then it went down my back (a few hours after receiving vaccine). Then slightly fogginess and at night the muscle pain became worse making it difficult to sleep and started getting cold flashes. Once asleep around 12:30 I started getting muscle aches that felt like they were burning and in random spots on body along with a headache and would get random cold and heat flashes. Kept yelling out in pain all night and increased tremors in hands. Boyfriend noticed I had a fever as well and gave me ibuprofen around 3am since pain was unbearable and was difficult to sleep. Almost took me to the hospital due to the intense pain.. In morning slightly better but still frontal lobe pain and aches throughout body with raised heart rate. Cannot do much or else aches get worse including headache.

It progressed to the point where I needed assistance walking.  I had extreme chills with uncontrollable shivering and muscle spasms.  I felt very cold though I was burning up and sweating profusely.  I went to sleep and woke up a few hours later with no fever but very sore muscles.  When I woke up in the morning, I felt like nothing had happened, I was just a bit groggy.

Was able to fall asleep at 4am. Symptoms improved upon waking at 8am, but chest pain and breathing difficulty remains as of 3:30pm April 9th (24 hours since injection)

Several minutes after injection - lightheadedness.  ~10PM - sudden overwhelming full body symptoms. Started with lightheadedness, fever, headache, and nausea. After laying in bed, the headache became extremely painful/throbbing. Full body aches (back, neck, legs) began. Ears got sensitive to sound, eyes got sensitive to light. Stayed in bed experiencing pain until ~1 pm the next day. After taking aleve around 11 am, the headache and fever subsidized, but the remainder of symptoms still persist.

                                                I felt fine immediately following my shot, as well as the rest of the day. Overnight I started developing a fever which I knew was normal. However at 3 am I got up to use the restroom. I was sitting on the toilet and then next thing I remember I was on the floor with my face down. I passed out, and I am unsure how long I was out for, before I realized what happened. I have never passed out before, and do not have a history of doing so, so it is unclear why I passed out randomly.

The following day was the exact same, except my front rib cage didn?t hurt anymore (only the back). I was extremely fatigued and I couldn?t sit down because my body hurt so much. The worst symptoms were the sharp ear and neck pain (by the ears). It was a sharp, sporadic pain, but it still hurts a lot.  It?s now been 2 days since the shot and the neck and ear pain is now more frequent, though my fever and some of my muscle sores are now getting better. I also feel extremely nauseous, like I?m going to puke anytime soon.

                                                My daughter got the shot at 1 pm on the 8th of April, 2021. (My daughter &amp; I both got the shot at the same shot at the same time). By 11:00 pm my daughter started complaining with feeling dizzy. She kept saying she felt like she was going to throw up, meaning she was nauseated. She was complaining with her bones hurting. We both got these symptoms at the same time. We both stayed in and out of the shower letting the shower water just run on us. I had to give her ibuprofen because she complained of a mild headache &amp; the pain all over her body. She couldn?t sleep at all. She cried. It had her scared. I fully believe she?s having an allergic reaction to the Janssen shot. I have fully read the Janssen ?fact sheet?. My daughter was having hot flashes &amp; cold sweats. She has ongoing symptoms &amp; it?s been 2 days since receiving shot including fever. She was having what I thought heart palpitations. We both swelled up causing our bodies to feel tight. We both were healthy before receiving the shot. We?ve never had covid nor tested positive. We are currently going to receive a check up by a doctor. The side effects of this medication is dangerous &amp; doesn?t compare to flu like symptoms.

                                                7:00pm- start to feel really cold, develop a high fever and chills and eventually go home to lay down.  8:30pm- uncontrollable shaking and high fever maintains and I develop I very bad migraine, I can&#39;t feel my arms or legs and everything sounds like my head is underwater (I think this might have been a migraine but I&#39;ve never had one). When I stand up my vision goes black, and I develop joint pain, muscle aches, and very bad nausea.  9:00pm - I take 500mg of aspirin and all of my syptoms persist for ~30 minutes when suddenly my fever breaks and I&#39;m sweating underneath my 3 blankets and I can think again as long as I don&#39;t move my head. Everything still sounds weird and my stomach and joints still hurt but I go to sleep. 4:00am- wake up crying from the headache and with a fever again so I take 500 more mg of aspirin and set an alarm to take more at 10am.  10:00am- I feel exhausted and really weird, I take only 250mg of aspirin and sleep the whole day.  4:00pm - I wake up feeling so much better. Kind of achy and still very nauseous, my ears still ring when I stand up.   4:00pm yesterday - now: I kept movement at a minimum and was still nauseous throughout the day but was able to eat at around 9pm. I think I may have had a low grade fever on and off last night but the headache has thankfully stayed away and other than a little bit of arm soreness and weakness I feel back to normal today.

                                                About 9 hours after receiving the Janssen vaccine on April 9th, I started feeling ill. I had a fever of 102, difficulty walking/moving on my own, intense nausea, numbness in my left arm for about 2 minutes, and I spontaneously got my period (which was very regular up until then). I took Tylenol, went to bed, woke up with a 100 degree fever but feeling much better, and it soon dropped back to 98 degrees.  Today, on April 13th, I started having pain in my left arm and leg. Specifically, in my left bicep (not the injection site) and my left thigh. This pain does not feel like muscle soreness, but almost like a knot? I&#39;m not sure how to describe it, but I find it odd the pain in my arm increases a bit when I walk/move.

                                                Several hours after the vaccine I noticed abdominal pain located in my lower back, primarily on the left side. I also had a pounding headache (not a migraine), and other body aches. Over the next several days (Thursday night through Saturday, 4/1-4/3) these symptoms persisted along with mild dehydration and constipation. The aches I treated with ibuprofen, and I used a mild, natural laxative to try to poop. The constipation was relieved by pooping, but it was much less than my normal amount of stool, and it took a couple days to fully abate. I also noticed that I wasn?t sweating very much/at all until about a week after I received the vaccine, which was very worrying. I attempted to drink plenty of water during all of this, though I can?t be sure I succeeded. I think my menstrual period may have happened during this week, maybe starting on the Tuesday falling the vaccine, but cannot remember for sure. Constipation and dehydration are unusual for my period, though the pain is not. There was soreness in my arm muscles around the vaccine site, but it was consistent with what I feel from any other vaccine, and only lasted a day.  All discomfort ceased about a week after the vaccine.

                                                I woke up at 1am feeling fatigued. At 3am it hit my like a truck. My body was so weak I could barley move. I had an unbearable headache. I felt very nauseous.  I had extreme chills and sweats.  This lasted non-stop  until 6am.  I woke up around 10am  with a bad headache and like my body had been through something traumatic.  I felt even more nauseous and had very bad diarrhea . Anything I would consume would make my stomach go into a knot and come straight out. After 10am I felt dizzy and weak. I still had a bad beach ache; and medicine wasn?t doing anything.  This lasted until I went to bed around 11pm that next night.  When I woke up around 9am on Friday I still felt a little drained and a small headache. My stomach was the worst part after my episode on Wednesday night. Around 5pm medicine started to help with my headache so I would say my symptoms stopped about that time , not including my abdominal pain. My stomach pain lasted until Saturday evening.

I ended up trying to take Benadryl and then  threw that right up. I  then ended up going to the ER and receiving  Zofran, Fluids, Tylenol, Torodol and Morphine.   I got discharged with &#34;an adverse reaction to the covid-19 vaccine and unknown pain&#34; When I was discharged I had a fever of 100 and on the drive home I was in intense pain. It subsided but I am still not feeling well, I feel very groggy and light headed in addition to the pain.

The daughter has no history of anxiety, no breathing issues.   They did labs and everything was okay, her counts were somewhat off but nothing felt to be abnormal.      She then went to another Hospital as she was still not feeling well, and checked the other reports from the other hospital and they conferred with that information, gave her Valium and sent her home.

                                                I received my J&amp;J vaccine at around 3:00pm. By 10:00pm, I was feeling very tired and achey and went to bed. I woke up at 2:00am with a fever of 102.5, a terrible headache and unbearable body aches. I took some ibuprofen and tried to go to bed but began vomiting. This lasted for 3-4 hours and I was unable to sleep. The next day I began to feel better in the afternoon but by 6:00pm the fever and aches worsened again and I began vomiting uncontrollably, about every 10 minutes. I couldn?t keep anything down, even water. I had a virtual urgent care visit and the doctor ordered me to go to the emergency room. At the ER, the doctors determined I was severely dehydrated. I received 2 bags of IV fluid, nausea medicine and pain medicine. I spend about 3 hours in the ER before I was sent home. I had to keep taking nausea medicine to prevent vomiting for the next day or so.

                                                Episode of apparent vasovagal syncope a few minutes after receiving the vaccine.  This was witnessed by myself.  She appeared to have loss of consciousness and collapsed onto the pavement striking her posterior head on the pavement (fortunately, she did not strike it with great force).  She regained consciousness within 2-3 seconds.  She had a small &#34;knot&#34; on her posterior scalp, but no break in the skin.  No other apparent injury.  She initially complained of a headache, but this resolved over the course of about 10 minutes.  She initially was mildly diaphoretic and had a rapid pulse and mild hypotension, but these also resolved over the course of several minutes.  A chemical ice pack was applied to the posterior scalp and neck.  She had a completely normal neurologic and musculoskeletal examination.  She was provided oral fluids (water and kool aid) and a snack (chewy granola bar) and kept under close observation by medical personal for about 30 minutes.  Transport to the emergency room via ambulance was offered, but declined. Her boyfriend was called and came to drive her home after she had made an apparent complete recovery.  Both he and she were extensively counseled regarding signs and symptoms to be on the lookout for that would indicate the need for further medical evaluation and they both expressed complete understanding and agreement. Of note, she reported that she has had episodes of syncope in the past when having blood drawn for laboratory tests, but decided not to disclose this to on site personal prior to the vaccination thinking she would probably not have a problem.

Something like quivering shock waves started to radiate from the center of my chest and shuddered out through my entire body, causing every muscle to shake uncontrollably; the shaking became increasingly violent. My heart was racing. I took deep breaths and applied a cool, wet hand towel to my forehead/neck to relax, but none of it helped.  After about 20 minutes, the violent shaking was only getting worse, so I took one Aleve. The shaking continued for another 20 minutes. Finally, it became less frequent and I could tell I had a little more control but was still shivering. My thumbs were also numb and tingly for the duration of the shaking (about 40 minutes) and afterwards. Eventually I completely relaxed and fell asleep, but I am now sore from being so tense.   Still have slight fever and aches.

At approximately 4:48pm, she stood up to tell staff that she was feeling ok and wanted to pick up an item in the store. A staff member saw that she looked unwell and asked if she was ok and she said no. She passed out at that moment. She was unconscious for approximately 5-10 seconds. Her body became stiff and her shoulder/arm trembled during that time frame of being unconscious. She refused an ambulance. She remained in the pharmacy for 30 minutes until she no longer felt light-headed. During the 30 minutes, she felt light-headed, hot and was sweating. She said she felt fine after the 30 minute wait.

I had also drank some ginger and lemon tea before bed due to stomach upset (however I believe that may be linked to my history of digestion issues that are currently going under diagnosis linked to lactose intolerance and food sensitivity). 12:00 AM 3/12/2021: I started to experience a headache, muscular aches, and chills continuing. I made myself a cup of mint tea for the warmth and the addition of the stomach settling aspect of mint.  12:15 AM 3/12/2021: I had a bowel movement and the nausea and stomach upset and gas has begun to pass (making me think that portion is linked to non-related issues of the vaccine, but wanted to note in case your professional opinion thought otherwise!). Chills, aches, and headache still continuing with little shift in extremity. 12:30 AM 3/12/2021

                                                My adverse reaction was about 24 hours of severe flu like symptoms. I received the vaccine Friday afternoon 3/12, and around midnight that night (so 3/13 technically) I developed flu like symptoms. I had a mild fever, severe body aches, severe headache, nausea, fatigue, etc. For the entire day of 3/13 I was pretty much bed ridden. Around 5pm on the 13th I took Tylenol and felt a little better and was able to eat something and fall asleep that night. I woke up on the 14th with just a sore arm where I received the shot.

                                                Around 10pm on 3/26, I got a slight headache, but I am not sure if it was due to screen time or a vaccine side effect. Per the clinician that administered the shot, I took 2 tabs of Tylenol (one normal adult dose) with water and went to bed. At 1 am on 3/27, I woke up incredibly sore all over but especially in my joints. I was shivering badly and woke up in a tightly curled fetal position. I was unable to lie still or warm up. I eventually went back to sleep and woke up at 5 am, this time with extreme nausea and threw up everything I had eaten the day before. This went on for a couple of minutes. I was still shivering constantly and sore and achy everywhere. Especially in my knees, shoulders, and lower back. At 6 am, I was still awake and while I still had chills, my face felt hot and I took my temperature twice. First getting 100.74 then 100.86. Slept deeply for the rest of the night. At noon on 3/27 I woke up with no nausea,  body aches but only in my joints but with general soreness everywhere (like after a good workout) and a temp still in the 100.7 degree range. I took 2 Tylenol tabs at 2pm. At 4pm, I only had slight body aches, a headache, and a slight brain fog left and my temp was at 98.7, so no more fever. No further problems showed  up and when I woke up at 9 am on 3/28, I felt absolutely fine other than soreness at the injection site and a little chest tightness which last for about 2 days, through 3/30.

Client said she was feeling warm and her head was throbbing. Client said her name. Client was eventually able to sit up in a chair and said she was feeling hot and lightheaded. Client asked to lay on the floor and legs were placed on a chair. Client said she was feeling better after this. PHN came back to the bathroom with ice pack, fruit strip, water, and apple juice. Client seen throwing up again, vaccinator was standing by with client. Vital signs taken after episode of emesis. BP: 113/84 and HR: 75. Client asked to take deep breaths and slow breathing, which client was able to do. Client said she was still feeling hot so client was given another ice pack. Client felt cold after some time so both ice packs removed. PHN asked another PHN to come assess client and Dr. called in to assess client also. Client was throwing up for the third time, and Dr. suggested we call 911 to get her checked out. EMS called at 1808 by other PHN. Client said she is only allergic to an antidepressant but did not recall the name. Client continued to talk and be responsive throughout entirety of event. Client called someone she knew to pick up her truck as she knew she would be going to the hospital. PHN took down name of friend, his number, and client?s keys. PHN gave keys and information to client flow lead, who gave items to an employee to ensure keys were returned to trusted entity. EMS arrived. Client denied any swelling, throat closing sensation, sensation of a thick tongue, or itching. Client taken on stretcher to Hospital.

                                                About 5 min after vaccination (within the 15 min observation time), patient was pale, dizzy, feeling faint, sweating, and nauseous. She said  she was about to pass out. She was sitting on chair with head leaning back, and resting on the wall. I raised her legs, resting on another chair. About 2 min later, she vomited. About 1 min later, she started to feel better. She asked for water, and we gave her some lukewarm water. Her face started to come back to normal, and she started to feel better and better. She sat for another 20 - 30 min, she felt better and left the pharmacy.

We gave her an ice pack and water after she came back and had her lay down for 10 more minutes.  I checked with her a few days later she said she had fever and chills 8 hours after the vaccine but felt better.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. About 1am I woke up short of breath. I sat up in bed to catch my breath and immediately felt nauseous. I went to the bathroom because I thought I was going to throw up but only ended up dry heaving. After sitting for a minute to catch my breath again I started shaking really bad and couldn&#39;t stand up without having blacked out vision. Luckily I grabbed my phone when I went to the bathroom so my mom could come home to help me. Until about 5 am I was shaking going between being extremely hot and extremely cold. After that my body SEVERE:Y ached all day with off and on sweats and headaches. I took Tylenol all day. I started feeling better with just some fatigue around 6pm.

As the night continued, if I moved my head at all it would cause severe pain and a pounding headache. Additionally, I experienced shooting pains through my neck and back, I became extremely hot to the touch, yet I felt freezing cold and could not stop shivering. Then I developed severe aching and tingling from the top of my head to the tips of my toes, with excruciating lower back pain and I could feel my heart beating very fast. My entire body was tense and sore. These symptoms did not alleviate for 12 hours and I could not fall asleep due to the discomfort I was in. I finally was able to fall asleep at 6 a.m. after the aching/tingling/pain/hotness subsided (about 12 hours after side effects started).

My body ached the day after the shot and then the evening after is when my symptoms became more severe. I was extremely tired and my entire body hurt. It hurt to even touch my hair, lay in bed, stand, and be covered up by blankets. The following day I just felt tired and my arm was sore. Three days after my vaccine I woke up with a sore throat and neck, but just on the left side. I slept the majority of the day and my body felt achy all day. Four days after my vaccine I woke up again shivering uncontrollably and my body felt sore all over.

Thursday I felt mostly fine just some tiredness and a little weakness. Friday evening I started to feel light headed and then by Friday night I felt a lump in my throat and my neck felt like it was burning. The burning continued into Saturday. I went to the pharmacist and he told me to take some Tylenol and an antihistamine. That helped a lot with the burning feeling. Sunday I felt very weak all day and felt more of a slight tightness in my throat. Monday the weakness and tightness in the throat continued just not as extreme.

                                                Painful injection but fine for the majority of the day. Started feeling muscle fatigue around 4pm, with upper body aches, stinging eyes, and nausea by 6pm. Fever of 102, and progression to full body aches and headache by 8pm in addition to the aforementioned symptoms that continued throughout the night. Fever lowered to 99 and only minor body aches by mid morning on the 12th. Headache continued throughout the day with low grade fever. I predict that I will feel 100% better within 48 hours.

Symptoms lasted until 8:00 pm the following night. My arm is still puffy and red and sore. I have a rash on injection site. Also bled when I got the vaccine which hasn?t happened before.

                                                Approximately 4 hours after receiving the injection, I started developing a fever, within an hour it had reached 103.3 F. At this point I took 400 mg of over the counter ibuprofen which helped drop my temperature slightly to approximately 102.2 F.  This fever continued into the night. I took another dose of ibuprofen before sleeping, about 6 hours after the first dose. Along with fever I experienced strong shaking/chills, muscle and joint soreness, headache, dizziness, confusion, and chest pain/feeling of pressure on the chest. The day after vaccination I continued to have a low-grade fever of approximately 100 F which subsided by evening. All other symptoms subsided as well except for the chest pain. On the second day post-vaccination my only remaining symptom is the chest pain.

                                                7 hours after the vaccine at 8pm, I had extreme chills, a fever started at 99 degrees, and my body started to hurt. At 11pm, my chills were so bad I was wearing a coat and stocking cap in my house under blankets, I was physically shaking, and my teeth were chattering. My fever was 100 degrees and my body aches were bad. From midnight until around 6 am, I was not able to sleep at all because I was so uncomfortable. My body went from having the chills to being extremely hot and couldn&#39;t cool down, my fever fluctuated between 101-102 degrees, and the muscle aches and headaches were the worst. My lower back and hip specifically hurt extremely bad to the point where I had to get up and try to walk around in hopes of making it feel better. My headache was horrible and it felt like my brain was filled with fluid and pressure. I cried on and off all night. At 2 am and again at 4 am my brain started to hallucinate and I was seeing things and having delusional thoughts. If I could have driven myself, I would have taken myself to the ER at this point but I knew in my condition I could not drive.  At 6 am, my symptoms started getting a little bit better. I was not completely back to normal until about 36 hours after receiving the vaccine, but the first 12 hours were the worst.

                                                I received the shot at 14:30, in which medical staff in the jail&#39;s medical center watched me for 20 minutes to ensure there were no immediate reactions. I went about my day afterward with no symptoms. At 21:30 when I went to sleep, I got some aches in my joints and took 1 dose of liquid capsule NyQuil to help with the pain and went to sleep. At 00:30, the 7th, I woke up groaning in my sleep to the extreme pain in my joints and feeling hot internally. I decided to get up and take a warm bath to ease the aches. I went and ran the bath and all of a sudden while it was running, I had a severe need to throw up, but could not naturally. Since this was concerning, I got up and walked out of the bathroom and all of a sudden in the hall I got a feeling of impending doom and that something was not right and I fainted. I laid on the floor for what I would approximate to be 5 minutes going in and out of consciousness waiting for the blood to fully return to the brain. After this, I instantly felt like I needed to survive and that I felt like I could be dying so I slowly crawled down the stairs to get to my military ID so I could call the military&#39;s nurse advice line. I had to take a break and lay on the concrete in my garage because I felt so dizzy and so hot and began to feel my vision disappear like I was going to faint again. I waited a few minutes before getting back up the stairs crawling to my phone to call. When I called them 00:58, they told me to call 911 because they believed I would be having a severe reaction, though I noted to them I did not have a rash or hives. I then called 911 at 01:08. They sent EMT&#39;s to my home which took my vitals. I had normal blood pressure, SPo2, and temp, but an elevated heart rate of just under 100 and a high respiration rate. EMT&#39;s made the decision for me to stay home since the hospital did not seem immediate in their opinion. After this I stayed on the couch for a few minutes and then felt very tired so I walked slowly to my room and fell asleep. I woke up at 06:00 for work, and arrived at 07:00. In the hour after waking up I was achy, sweating, and felt light headed. I got to work and my Sergeant told me to go home and sleep. I slept another 5 hours at 08:00 and when I woke up most of my symptoms went away other than aches and getting flush very easily for 5 days.  At this current time all I notice is some random light headedness that quickly resolves and comes a few times a day at random and without cause.

                                                I developed a moderate headache 3-4 hours after receiving the vaccine that became more painful over time. At 8 PM, I developed a rash on the left side of my face, neck and chest that lasted through the night and into the morning (about 12 hours). The rash did not look like hives, but it was itchy and blotchy red patches. I also spiked a 101 degree fever that lasted until the morning (about 12 hours).

                                                The day of vaccination and day after I was suffering from very severe head aches that caused me to not be able to look at screens or light during that time. I noticed on Sunday I began developing some redness on the tops of my hands. On Monday morning my hands began getting a rash on the knuckles and tops of my hands. I also noticed that since being vaccinated my nipples have been erect and are tender. Today my hands are no longer displaying a redness to them but they are still itchy and the skin feels dry like Eczema, something I never have had before in my life.

On April 12th I had a fever and woke up with red little dots around my eyes.  At night the fever went away. The following day April 13th I felt my chest tight and had shortness of breath throughout the day. I also had stomach pains at times.  April 14th and 15th (today) my chest still feels tight and I get tired very easily.  My arm is also still very sore and sensitive, I have a little bump where the vaccine was put in.

                                                Immediately after receiving the shot I began to have fairly intense pain at injection site. It continued in waves. I began to walk around the store for the allotted 15 minutes. I began to feel very dizzy and faint. My ears began ringing and I didn?t feel well. I stumbled back to the pharmacy to ask for help. At this point I was also feeling like it was very hard to breathe. I explained all these symptoms to the pharmacists on duty and they told me to just sit down. After sitting down I still felt faint but suddenly felt the need to vomit. I stumbled to the bathroom where I collapsed in front of the toilet and passed out twice, striking my head and throat on the bowl. After awaking I was very disoriented and felt very hot and clammy. The pharmacist then came and found me and told me to once again sit down and continue waiting. After sitting down for about 5 more minutes I began to feel less dizzy and was having an easier time breathing. I left the store as the pharmacist was ignoring me and didn?t seem concerned about my symptoms. After arriving home I was tired and week and very very cold. I noted my body temp was lower than usual. I took a nap and then these symptoms continued for about 24 hours. I am now feeling much better.

                                                Patient was very nervous about getting the covid vaccine. She sat for 15 minutes and after about 8 minutes she said she thought she was having a panic attack and felt hot. Tech administered vaccine and sat with her the whole wait time since she was nervous. Held an ice pack on her neck when she stated she felt hot. The 15 minute timer went off and she still felt nervous so she continued to sit. Rph also was present once the ice pack was given.  She had a dry heave at about 12 minutes. After 20 minutes we moved her to the floor she said she was seeing light flashes.  She was sweaty and hot. BP was taken at 420pm 162/109 and 98 pulse. Asked pt if we could call an ambulance, she felt she didn&#39;t need one. We got lead from Division 1, also suggested an ambulance and this time pt said ok.  Now BP taken was 157/109 and pulse 108.  Patient felt a dry heave and we put her on her side.  Ambulance arrived and put pt on a stretcher.

Right away after the shot I passed out and when I came to, I threw up a couple of times. I was taken to the ER and I had low potassium levels were low, but all other tests were normal. I had some aches pains and feverishness for a couple of days. Five days after the vaccine I had bad diarrhea several times a day. I was nauseous and feeling bad. I had an appointment with my GI doctor a week later but I had to go to the ER before that. They did not find anything in most tests. The next day I tested positive for CDIFF. I was prescribed antibiotics. I went back to the ER a third time because the Vancomycin prescription had caused severe nausea. I am still feeling bad after six weeks but it has gotten better.

The vomiting lasted for about 2 hours. Also, I was vomiting up small amounts of blood. About 24 hours post-shot, my entire body was sore, I still had chills and sweats,  I had a fever of 101.2, fatigue and a headache.  Day 2 after the shot, I was still extremely fatigued and sore. Day 3, I began to feel better. I was still fatigued, but the only soreness was in the arm that I got the vaccine along with some redness around the injection site. I also had no fever. Day 4,  my injection site was a little sore, I was slightly fatigued, and a small rash was on one of my arms for most of the day, but then the rash faded.

Because I have fibromyalgia, my doctor advised that I go to the hospital because it hurt to touch my skin. I was sent to the ER a week later because my symptoms had lasted so long, I had a persistent headache, and they wanted to check for thrombosis.

Around 8 am looked for the employee health nurse to get medication for nausea and headache. She was then making tea and was noted not to be feeling well and fainted.  Another employee found her on the floor, and her heart rate was 115, and BP was 112/64 with a 100-degree temp Fahrenheit. A couple of hours prior, her temp was 97 degrees Fahrenheit.  She looked diaphoretic, hypoglycemic, and was too weak to get off the floor, there was a maxi lift used to transfer to a wheelchair, and she was very dizzy. The only medicine taken was Pepto Bismol for nausea.

                                                Sunday night, my heart started pounding really hard. I went to ER - Medical Center. They did an EKG and took my vitals. I had a fever (slight) and chills and was nauseous. Put  ONDANSETRON -4 mg. The nausea didn&#39;t go away and I couldn&#39;t eat or drink without vomiting until today. I couldn&#39;t eat or drink or was very tired and groggy and miserable. Today I  had another trip to the ER Medical, I got on an antibiotic and anti-nausea medication (GETHALEXIN - 500 mg for the GI) (METOCLOPRAMIGE HCL - 5 mg-  for nausea) from the hospital and I had a shot that went into my immune system. They also found a UTI today.

                                                Started experiencing mild fatigue and body aches ~5 hours after getting the shot. Over the course of the day these symptoms started increasing and I developed chills and a fever around 100F at about 7 hours. Took an ibuprofen when symptoms persisted and fever kept rising.  Fever rose to over 101F while sleeping and woke me up once the ibuprofen ran its course. Did some wet towel compresses but did not help. Took another ibuprofen.   Muscle aches and chills persisted into the next day. Developed another mild fever in the second day. Symptoms resolved on day 3. Soreness in arm where the vaccine was administered persists.

The first reaction lasted half an hour. After taking two Benadryl tablets and Abuterol every four hours, the throat swelling calmed down. I still had difficulty breather for the following two days, but my Abuterol kept it at bay.

                                                About 5 hours after my vaccine I had already been asleep for around 30 minutes when I was startled awake by my own rapid heartbeat, it was beating so fast and hard that I could hear it and it woke me up. I reviewed my literature about the vaccine I received at the pharmacy and saw this reaction could be due to an allergic reaction but as an uninsured person I had to just wait it out to see if it would go away. I drank a lot of water and started developing a headache but my heart rate finally slowed down enough that I was no longer alarmed, but it was still faster than usual. I went back to sleep around 2am only to awake once again around 5am because I had begun to experience the worst body aches I?ve ever felt as well as nausea and a pounding headache. I live on a semi truck with no bathroom so my fiancé had to take me to my parents house so I would have access to a bathroom. I took ibuprofen and Tylenol for my pain and took 6 showers in 24 hours just to soothe my body aches. It felt worse than any flu I?ve ever had (I received the flu vaccine back in January if that matters). I was extremely ill and had no appetite and pretty much just slept and cried for about 36 hours total, but yesterday afternoon I finally felt a little better although still experiencing a terrible headache. Today I woke up feeling completely fine. I just wanted to report my side effects.

Continued to vomit all day probably because of the fever.  Gave liquids only. By 9:00 pm fever fluctuating 99 to normal.  Hopefully by 4/2 all symptoms will have passed.  I did not take her to the doctor for this although when the symptoms started I was very concerned because she does not speak and I didn?t know if she was having chest pains.

                                                I passed out in my bathroom the morning after the vaccine shot around 5:30am. I called the doctors and they said that was unrelated to the vaccine, but I had intense dizziness and tinnitis before I passed out. I was incredibly fatigued all day long for the rest of the day and had a migraine - both to be expected. However, I am 3 weeks post-vaccine (April 3) and have been having intense muscle cramping and fatigue in my legs during exercise. I wake up with muscle soreness that goes away throughout the day and then comes back during exercise.

                                                At around 9:15 PM I started to feel nauseous and got out of bed to go to the bathroom. While using the bathroom I felt a very strong chill come over my whole body and started shivering and got directly back into bed and wrapped myself up in a thick blanket. For 45 minutes I laid wrapped up and was shivering constantly. At 10 pm I was brought extra blankets and a heating pad but moving to get situated caused dizziness. It was about 10:30 when the shivering stopped. I was able to sleep but got up to go got the bathroom around midnight and my entire body was drained of energy and I felt that I could barely stand and walk on my own. I was dizzy and my head hurt as well. I could barely hold my arms up to look at my phone briefly. Between 11 PM and 2 AM I had 5 or 6 high heart rate alerts (over 120) according to my Apple Watch but I did not wake up to them. In the morning (Sunday 4/4/21) around 9-10 am my head still hurt and my body was very achy and I felt very hungover. All day I continued to feel achy almost with a bad cold or a minor flu. Today has been better but I have still felt pretty drained. I?ve had continuous arm soreness in the arm I got the injection - but nothing too severe.   15 minutes after my vaccine on Saturday 4/3/21 I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and around midnight of that night I took 2 of pain relief PM acetaminophen (1000 mg of acetaminophen total snd 50 mg of diphenhydramine HCI total)

                                                At approximately 0945 this nurse witnessed patient sitting in the observation area with her head tilted to the left side and her body leaning to the left. The medical assistant was with her holding her body up. Her eyes were closed and she had no color to her face and lips. She was not able to respond to questions being asked. As her head was shaking she was making grunting noises. She was diaphoretic and tremulous. This episode lasted for approximately 60 seconds. Pt then opened her eyes and was able to respond to questions asked but with a delayed response. Pt was moved to the stretcher to lay down. Her color came back to her lips and her blood pressure improved. She was responding to questions appropriately. Pt was diaphoretic for approximately 10 minutes. Ice packs and water were provided. Pt was observed by the medical assistant for 30 minutes. Her HOB was elevated gradually until she was able to dangle her feet and sit on the side of the stretcher.  Pt stated that she was feeling better and was ready to go be with her roommate.    Vital signs were taken and BP 91/54, HR 70, O2 97%.  At 0952 HR was 62. 1005 BP 102/67, HR 57 O2 99%.

Then I started feeling cold chills, and had to lie down in bed for the rest of the day.  Slight fever also occured and intense body aches. However, these slowly subsided after taking tylenol at about 6PM. I slept through the night and outside of feeling a little lethargic the next day, I was back to normal.

Arm soreness  Back pain was mostly felt on the left side and accompanied by leg pain. I?ve had back pain in the past but this was x100 worse to the point where I considered going to the ER.

                                                Started developing a headache about 2/3 hours after the vaccine. Took some ibuprofen, at 7:11am I still have a severe headache being treated by otc pain reliever. About 2:30am I woke up from my headache and realized I was freezing cold, dispute it being 74 degrees in my house. I did not have a fever but I had extreme chills, my entire body shivering and shaking at some points. This made it hard to stand or even get some water. These lasted about 2 hours or so. Once I was able to get warm again, under several blankets and a heated blanket they did go away and  I did not experience them again.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccine (04/05/2021), I became very tired, but otherwise had no adverse reactions. I went to bed around 9 pm, and at around 3 am the next morning (04/06/2021), I woke up with severe chills, body aches, a pressure headache, and some mild nausea (I believe caused by the headache) that lasted through until early afternoon. Taking ibuprofen seemed to help the body and headaches, but it seemed like it was difficult to regulate my body temperature. I couldn&#39;t tell if I was too hot or too cold, and trying to remedy one or the other made me either too cold or too hot, respectively. All effects completely cleared up by 04/07/2021.

                                                I started experiencing side effects about 6 hours after receiving the vaccine. I experienced chills, sweating, 99.5 fever, headache, head pounding, dizziness, nausea,  tiredness, sore body, sore left arm, and had trouble sleeping. I took two Motrin pills and felt a little better and was able to sleep. In the morning, I woke up tired, sweating, had a sore left arm and sore body so I took two more Motrin pills and am feeling mostly better. Fever, headache, head pounding, dizziness, and nausea are gone.

                                                Initial injection was recieved with arm extended out and raised in car window. Really painful injection. Several seconds after vaccine injected I felt a wave of chills on my body and immediately started profusely sweating. Seconds after that i then began to get extremely dizzy, blacking out, trying to stay conscious for a personnel to walk by and after a few moments the feeling slowly lightened up minus the excessive sweating and chills. Personnel then told me it was just anxiety and brushed it off. I have never had a reaction like this from a vaccine before so this experience was unsettling.

                                                Got the shot at 9:20am on Saturday (April 10th). By the time I sat down to do the 15min waiting period before I could leave. My arm from the back of my shoulder all the way down to around my thumb joint in my hand ached so bad. By around 3pm on the same day, I started to feel really tired and had a pounding migraine. By 4:30p I started to get really cold and everything started to ache. By 6p I was feeling hot but at the same time cold and shivering. My head was pounding. Every muscle ached all over my body, and by every muscle I mean even my eye muscles and pelvic floor muscles. My face had so much sinus pressure that it felt like it could explode. My skin, all over my body, was so sensitive that it hurt to the touch. On top of my skin being sensitive to the touch, off and on my skin would tingle, including the inside of my mouth and tongue. My lymph nodes were swollen enough in my neck that my throat ached.  I was mentally confused and shaking. Everything got bad enough I started crying and hyperventilating. I felt sick to my stomach and felt digestive pain. My entire body felt so heavy. By the time it got to around 8p, my mom finally took my temperature, which at that point I had already been taking Tylenol all day and was no longer shivering, and I had a temperature of 101 degrees F. I finally went to bed around 9p. I was thirsty but my stomach felt sick. I still ached and woke up around 10 times throughout the night either feeling too hot or cold or hurting so bad. At 4am I took a Tylenol because it everything hurt bad enough to able to fall asleep. The next day. I mostly better. I was still tired and a little achy and my lymph nodes under my arm pits were swollen. At this point my lungs felt strange. Harder to breathe than normal.  I was starting to cough. The day after that (today) I have felt fairly normal except I?m coughing and my lungs still feel a little strained. No more aches or fever or anything like that though.

                                                At around 10:30 AM on 3/29/2021, I began to notice some irritation and phlegm build up in my throat, as well as some tingling and numbness in my face. This lasted for approximately 30 minutes before subsiding. At around 8:00 PM on 3/29/2021, I began developing a fever and somewhat severe body aches that lasted until the morning of 3/31/2021. I also developed a somewhat severe headache on the morning of 3/31/2021 that lasted through 4/1/2021. The injection site was tender to the touch from the evening of 3/29/2021 until 4/2/2021, and my arm was also very sore during this same time frame. I also noticed unusual exhaustion from the evening of 3/29/2021 until 4/5/2021. During 3/29/2021-4/1/2021, I was taking Tylenol Extra Strength (1 pill every 6 hours or so) to help alleviate symptoms, but it only helped for about 3 hours in the 6 hour interval.

The following morning, my arm hurt and I felt a bit tired, but other than that normal. About 27 hours after I received the vaccine, I had severe stomach pain. I ended up vomiting and having diarrhea at the same time, for an hour. Immediately following this, I was very feverish, and I got the chills horribly for about an hour. I was very tired for the next 48 hours, but Tylenol alleviated the fever and headache.

I started developing shortness of breath within an hour after receiving the vaccine. As of today, April 13th, I still have shortness of breath and a cough that I did not have before the vaccine

                                                The day following the vaccine (Wednesday 4/7/21), I woke up with body aches, a strong headache, feeling quite warm (no fever throughout the day, but I felt quite warm), and felt a lot of fatigue. There were no respiratory symptoms, but many of the body symptoms that I typically associate with a regular cold. I slept for much of the day Wednesday as the course of treatment - no medications were taken.  The symptoms persisted all day, and were essentially gone when I woke up the next day (Thursday 4/8/21).  I had varying levels of pain in my arm, where I received the shot. There was more pain than expected when the needle went into my arm, then all pain subsided by the time I went to sleep on the day the shot was received. The day of the cold-like symptoms there was significant pain at the injection site that persisted through Thursday. All pain resolved by Friday.

Passed out, unconscious within 5 minutes of receiving the shot. Could not sit up/dizzy for 30 minutes. Nausea, weakness, dizzy, poor mental acuity/memory. Later that night, and through the night for 10 hours, severe back pain. Nausea, severe weakness, dizzy, poor mental acuity and memory, sweats and chills.  The next day (day immediately after receiving vaccine) symptoms continued but lessened by 5 pm. Each day since then, the symptoms have ALL remained in a more mild form. Today is day 6 and I still have moderate back pain and occasional sweats, weakness and fatigue.

                                                Felt generally unwell 12 hours after the vaccination: onset of headache and body aches. During the night, fever spiked to 103 degrees, had uncontrollable shakes, chills, cold sweats, dizziness, and mild nausea. This lasted roughly 48 hours. After 48 hours, fever was reduced, body aches remained, but other symptoms subsided. I continue to feel generally unwell with body aches and a slight fever. In retrospect, I should have gone to the hospital.

                                                Prior to administration of Janssen Covid-19 vaccine the patient was anxious but was completely fine once the procedure commenced and concluded. After finishing explaining the possible side effects of the vaccine and handing the patient the V-Safe handout, she got up slowly and proceeded to our designated post vaccination monitoring seating arrangement. Upon concluding the vaccination process with the patient?s partner, she alerted the pharmacist that she does not feel well. To which he asked her to further elaborate on what she is experiencing. She began to say she thinks she?s going to faint as she is attempting to drink water. As she was having a drink of water she fainted. To which he responded by running over and catching her before she hit the ground, cradling her upper torso, specifically the head and laid her down on the floor with the assistance of pharmacist and her partner. In the midst of everything he instructed another pharmacy technician to call 911 for the paramedics. As she was in the process of drinking water I saw her other hand go to the region of the neck, thinking it was also an allergic reaction and administered a dose of Epi-Pen. He administered the Epi-Pen on the upper side of her thigh, directly to the skin not through clothing. There was a very brief moment where the patient began to convulse but gradually regain consciousness. The patient became lucid and was conversing with him, apologizing for the incident. He assured her there was nothing to apologize for and to which she told me she had similar incidents from vaccinations as a child. She did not mention this prior to administration of the vaccine and through conversation we believe the incident may be caused from high anxiety of needles / vaccinations. When the paramedics arrived, they assisted the patient from the floor and gave a warning that she believed she was going to faint again, and fainted in the arms of the paramedics.

The pain continued until noon when it lessened some with tons of advil I was able to move around slowly but pain persisted throughout the day and into the next 2 days. I finaly woke up pain free 4 days after getting the vaccine.

Sometimes in knees, mostly in calves... continued until midway through the night) - fatigue (felt just a little more tired than normal, really tired by bed time: 9pm) - heightened heart rate (excitement from vaccine / apprehension for potential illness?) Second day - Thursday:  - fatigue (tired all day, almost fell asleep through a couple meetings) - leg pain (reappeared in the morning, ached and throbbed. Made it difficult to relax. Was gone around 3/4pm) - headache (probably from dehydration, I was warm, but not completely a fever. Attempted to drink a lot of water, but too much made me nauseous)  - chills (sporadic, barely noticeable except it agitated the headache) - nausea (I barely ate more than a granola bar and attempted to drink water and tea, but too much made me sick, especially if it had sugar - mainly drank water. Had some soup later in the day (6pm) and most of the nausea went away)

One week after vaccine developed tingling in left leg, two weeks after vaccine developed mild numbness/loss of sensation on left side. Went to urgent care and then to ER, they suspected complex migraine as I have a history of migraine (though had never had one lasting that long). Numbness has been intermittent since but seems to have mostly gone away.

Over about a half hour, they escalated to severe chills and a 101.9 degree fever that lasted through the night. Chills subsided about 3am, but fever remained until following morning and slowly lowered until about noon the  day after vaccination. That day, arm soreness increased, with sharp pain when arms raised or pressure applied, and soreness continued until  five days after vaccination.

I went to the doctor and got a Strep test and Covid-19 test which were negative. I just took Advil and it lessened the pain. I still have a tender throat especially in the morning and when I work out. It has been a week and it does seem to be getting better.

                                                Since 6 hours after the j&amp;j vaccine, I have had a low grade headache every day that turns into a full blown headache/migraine every couple days. It feels like a constant pressure/squeezing in my head and I can feel my heart beat in my head at all times. It feels worse sitting/sitting up and better lying down on my side. When I get up in the morning it is a bit better and gradually gets worse as the day goes on. I have tried taking allergy/sinus medicine in case it was related to allergies (which i have never had) or a sinus infection but that doesn?t seem to work. I have also tried Maxalt when the headache turns bad but that doesn?t seem to work much, if at all. The only thing that seems to work is advil however I can?t take that forever since it could lead to stomach issues, etc. I am good at hydrating so that is not the issue and I eat and exercise regularly. Nothing has changed in my health/health routine since receiving the vaccine.

Pharmacy staff responded with cold compress, water, and advised to lower head if feeling faint. Patient appeared sweating and pale but shortly after drinking water and removing clothing she quickly improved. It is my opinion the patient was anxious and over heated.

I had a fever at the time. The shaking happened in episodes, and these episodes lasted 5-10 minutes, about a minute or 2 apart for about 30 minutes. I was still able to get up once during the shaking, and I was fully conscious. The shaking made my heart race, and I was very sore and had a hard time sleeping after the shaking finished.

On March 18, I noticed what I thought looked like razor bumps from shaving but they really hurt. I had not been sexually active and was confused what they would be. Went to the gyno and she thought they were in grown hairs from shaving and sweating from my fever. Then over the weekend I experienced more red spots on my crotch and severe pain that kept me up at night and made me want to cry. I called the emergency line for the gynocologist and she prescribed something for a bacterial infection as well as for type 1 herpes. I then went in the following thursday and was seen again for the bumps. The bumps felt exactly like described in other cases i recently read about - shingles. I was in pain for 2-3 weeks and would use zinc and witch hazel and advil to try to get through the pain. It did eventually feel better and go away.

                                                Two hours after the vaccine I felt bad. I had fatigue and a very sharp headache, chills and muscle and joint pain. The headache was very painful. I took Tylenol and used ice packs. I was still experiencing fatigue, nausea and headaches for tow weeks after the shot. The fatigue was very severe and I had no energy. Several weeks after the vaccine I was still very fatigued, and my depression was getting worse. I felt fine before the vaccine and my medication was working. My dosage was increased and it helped with the symptoms. It seems to have stabilized now  after eight weeks.

                                                I received the Johnson&amp;Johnson vaccine on Friday, May 28th...within 6 hours of receiving it, I was experiencing nausea, chills and fever. It rapidly progressed within 3 hours to the point where my entire left side was numb and I had foot droop, slurred speech and a severe migraine, often associated with a stroke. I was immediately taken to the ER where a CT of my brain, labs, and EKGs were performed due to symptoms I was experiencing closely related to neurological issues. All came back normal, but my left side numbness didn?t subside, nor did any other symptoms mentioned above, even with medications. I was transferred to another hospital to see a neurologist where they ordered an MRI of the brain and more labs and admission into the hospital for observation. Everything came back normal again but still unable to walk and use my left side. It came down to a diagnosis of a hemiplegic migraine, which is a rare and serious form of a migraine with symptoms mimicking a stroke. I was discharged 3 days later and was told to follow up with my primary care doctor and neurologist for further long term care....4 days later and I?m finally able to walk but definitely no where?s near my normal self. Very weak and experiencing many migraines a day

                                                The first day I?d say about 3-4 hours after getting the vaccine I noticed a headache, was also fatigue, and slightly dizzy (pretty common side effects.) as the days went on I noticed that the headaches would not go away, they did with taking Ibuprofen and Tylenol, but would return 4 hrs after taking. Monday (6-14-21) I really noticed that my neck was stiff feeling, I was getting really bad random bruises on my legs, I would get really ?airy? feeling in my head, dizzy, my heart would start racing, and my hands would get really sweaty, I also felt hot even in colder temperatures. Made an appointment Monday (6-14-21) to get bruises checked out thinking it was from something unrelated, Tuesday (6-15-21) I made an appointment to make sure I didn?t have the blood clot they did a full work up, and noticed that my blood sugar was abnormally low (58) I do not have a history myself of diabetes or ever been suspected of being prediabetic. Tuesday (6-15-21) was definitely the worst of it. Later on in the day while I was working I was seeing black spots out of the corners of my eyes, I could hardly stand, I could hardly breathe (felt like a horrible panic attack,) my heart was beating so fast I felt like it was going to burst, my hands were extremely sweaty and I felt like my body was shutting down, I had a horrible headache, I could barely drive, and when my mom was taking me to the ER, I could barely lift my arms up. Went home as my blood sugars were then fine and I was feeling okay. From that day forward I noticed that at 6:30pm every night I would get these same side effects. Saturday (6-19-21) the pattern finally broke, I no longer felt like I was dying (I wish I was exaggerating.)

                                                Starting the day of the shot, I had chills and heat flashes, often back to back along with muscle pain. Starting June 12th, I had random shaking of my right arm, so much so that I believed the baby in my lap was having a seizure, only to realize it was my arm. It happened every few minutes daily, however, I was out of town and didn?t know of any places to report it. I have video footage of the shaking. Since then, if I get excited or nervous about anything, I feel a sensation that I can only describe as my blood vibrating. I quickly calm myself and it goes away. Other than that, I have persistent stomach pain whenever I eat. It?s a pain I?ve never felt before and don?t know how to describe it. It takes place right above my navel and lasts for what I assume is the duration of me eating.

                                                Within seconds of receiving the vaccine I began to feel slightly dizzy. By the time I walked across the room to the observation table I was feeling lightheaded. They sat me down, gave me water and a cookie, but about 2min after the injection the dizziness was so intense that I began to black out. I was unconscious for about 1-2min, then came to but my vision was still unclear. I was taken via wheelchair to the paramedics on the opposite end of the gymnasium, and at this point I was heavily perspiring and very pale but still coherent. I felt my vision and dizziness significantly improve after being able to lay down. I was transported to the hospital for observation but had much improved by the time I arrived. An EKG, bloodwork, and cardiac tests were recommended to discern possible underlying heart related conditions, but I declined because I already had a PAT for thyroid surgery scheduled the next day that would be running those same tests. This reaction was likely due to not having eaten  for several hours prior to the vaccine. After about an hour I felt well enough to drive myself back home and dealt with mild aches and pains that evening, chills, and a low grade fever all of which resolved themselves by the next morning.

                                                I woke up noticing a slight headache, but I figured it was from poor sleep the night prior. I noticed after breakfast that I felt really cold and felt an internal shiver, especially in my chest. My fingers and toes were ice cold even with a sweater, blanket, and a warm tea. I noticed my skin starting to feel tender and I felt very fatigued. I wanted knew I needed to eat so that I could take ibuprofen, but I experienced a loss of appetite. I had a mild cough, but I felt too tired to even cough. I rocked in a chair in the sunlight outside for about 15 minutes and still felt cold. When I took my oral temperature after coming inside, I was reading 99.9. I took 400mg of Ibuprofen by 1130 and layed down to rest. Bundled in 3 layers, I felt the shivering couldn&#39;t stop. My headache got worse and my skin was tender to the touch. I was able to sleep for approximately 3 hours and I woke up drenched in sweat. I took my oral temperature again and was at 101.1. I drank some more water and tried to sleep some more. When I woke up around 4:30 pm, I felt a lot better. My temperature went down to 97.8 and I had a boost in energy and appetite. I no longer had a headache and I had only mild muscle aches. By the next morning, I felt completely normal again.

I started getting really cold, took my temperature and it was at 100.1. Got a headache, slightly nauseous, body aches got a lot worse (particularly my lower back). I was also feeling a little dizzy and having a hard time comprehending information; this was probably the fever. Around 8pm,  I took my temperature again and it had risen to 102. I took some extra strength Tylenol which started helping about 30 minutes later. I woke up 3/12/2021 still with some body aches, slight headache, and slight stomachache.

She began to feel faint and an employee of our facility caught her as she experienced a near syncopal episode. She was promptly placed in Trendelenburg position and vitals obtained. BP was 90/58 with mild tachycardia to max of 130-140 bpm. Patient was given supportive treatment and monitored. BP improved to 110/70 after 5 minutes and 120/72 after 15 minutes. Patient continued to feel very dizzy and weak, however, and became tachycardic and diaphoretic each time she attempted to move to a seated position. After 1 hour of monitoring and vitals showing continued tachycardia, decision was made to transport the patient to ER for further testing. Patient expressed agreement and understanding of plan to transport to ER via ambulance.

My arm that the shot was in, hurt to move but was bearable. The injection spot is inflamed and raised and the arm muscle still had a deep ache almost a week later.

Every-time I stand up it jumps to 116. My resting heart rate was 113 for 8hours straight Monday night. So the j&amp;j website lists that as an allergic reaction. The urgent care basically said wait it out and be careful cuz if I move like too fast I could pass out again cuz of the blood pressure

                                                The night of the vaccination, I had chills that lead to uncontrollable shivering. Eventually, that turned into full-body aches, a headache, and severe dizziness. The following day I still had the body-aches and I was exhausted, sleeping most of the day.  The day after that, I felt fine.

                                                On 03/05/2021 approximately 5 hours after vaccination: headache, aches, chills, possible low-grade fever. Symptoms lasted until mid-day 03/06/2021. Acetaminophen was taken after first symptoms appeared and approximately every 6-8 hours until symptoms passed.  Arm soreness lasted several days after vaccination.  On 03/20/2021: felt 2 large swollen (probably) lymph nodes above collarbone on left side. Lymph nodes are visibly raised under the skin. The one closer to the left arm is larger than the one next to it which is closer to the neck. They are barely sore, if at all. Lymph nodes are still swollen at the time of this writing.

                                                The injection itself was quite painful (and I&#39;ve had many vaccine shots in my life). Felt completely fine until around 4pm when I felt a dull headache. Around 5pm, my head was throbbing so much that I couldn&#39;t leave my bed. Around 6pm, I felt muscle pains starting around my neck, slowly moving to my shoulders, chest, and upper back. Without taking any medication, I slept and woke up around 8pm. I was sweating, felt so cold but hot at the same time. The muscle pains were intense, and my head hurt so much that I took a single capsule of 200mg Advil. The pain became more manageable around 30 minutes later. Was still sweating, and muscle aches continued. I slept again at around 2am (May 26, 2021) and woke up at 10am. Head was no longer hurting, but muscle aches were still lingering. Currently, 1:04pm on March 26, 2021, I feel weak and tired with muscles pains around my upper body, but overall feeling much better than yesterday.

                                                Approximately 7 hours after receiving the single dose of the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine,  symptoms such as muscle aches, fatigue, and fever set in. Symptoms rapidly worsened over the next few hours, with the fever reaching a max temp of 103 degrees Fahrenheit. This required monitoring and the use of ice packs to keep the fever under control. Muscle aches were severe, and were particularly prominent in the lower back region and the injection site. Fever remained in the 100-103 degree range for the duration of the night and by the next day, temperature returned to around 98 degrees.

                                                I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine at 8:30AM on Friday, March 26. The only symptoms I experienced until that evening were mild soreness at the injection site, mild stiffness/soreness in my left arm and my neck, and mild body aches. At 6:00PM that day, I was driving and experienced sudden-onset nausea and dizziness. I experienced tunnel vision and my vision began to black out. I was able to pull off the road and began retching and dry heaving. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my lips and then in my right hand, each of which lasted for about a minute. The nausea lasted for 5-10 minutes, after which it dissipated and I started experiencing chills. After returning home, around 9:30PM I experienced a severe headache and a return of sudden-onset nausea. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my right hand again, which disappeared after about 5 minutes. I retched and dry heaved again, and I took two Advil. The nausea passed and I was able to go back to sleep. The next morning, the nausea had completely disappeared,  and the only lingering symptoms were a mild headache and mild stiffness/body aches.

                                                ?Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine?  Approximately 5 hours after recieving the vaccine I started feeling extremely tired and cold despite the climate being warmer than usual. I went to sleep and woke up shivering, i was cold but my body was burning to the touch. My body ached and I had a headache and nausea. My eyes hurt whenever I moved them. These symptoms persisted until 9:18, I took 2 tylenol pills and started feeling better. Today is my third day, my eye pain has not gone and I still feel tired but what is bothering the most is the eye pain whenever I look anywhere or move my head.

                                                Started to feel tired a few hours after the vaccine with slight aches. I had a fever by the time I went to bed. The entire night was spent tossing and turning, drenched in sweat while simultaneously feeling like I was on fire. On top of this I had a massive headache. Today is the day after and my fever has gone down throughout the day, but it is pretty bad. I still have a headache and also vomited a few times today. I have been taking acetaminophen and took some pepto bismol. I was able to start eating later in the day.

When I attempted to take a shower, I fainted for a few seconds and it was a struggle to move. Only felt comfortable when I was laying down. My muscles all felt painful and sore, had a painful headache, felt very disoriented and woozy. It was a struggle to walk or move, and couldn&#39;t talk loud or for a long time at once. Had to go home from work and spent the rest of the day sleeping. Around 4pm, 24 hours after the injection, my muscles felt less sore and was feeling better. The next morning, I was back to being completely normal.

After providing the same immunization to her spouse she lost color in her face, began sweating, and became faint. She did not lose consciousness but was drowsy, diaphoretic, pale and stated she lost hearing for a couple minutes. I kept her awake and asked her questions to assess for alertness. She was aware of date, location, name, year. She was not improving after 5 minutes so paramedics were called to evaluate her. She was cared for by the paramedic team and recovered after 40 minutes. She was diagnosed with vasovagal syncope due to the vaccine. She refused transport to the ER and left of her own accord.

                                                I am a 25 year old female with no underlying/otherwise known health conditions. I received the vaccine Saturday, March 27th at ~1:30pm. No initial side effects, barely any arm pain, and I felt completely normal and fine for about 8 hours post vaccination. After ~8 hours, I began to develop body aches and tiredness, and within an hour of this onset I got severe chills. A few hours later (this is the middle of the night going into Sunday March 28th) I developed a fever that lasted into the next day. I was not able to take my temperature in the middle of the night but the next morning it had come down to 99.6F (still a slight fever). I had fatigue and tiredness the entire next day. I did not take any medication/fever reducer.  To sum up, I had no side effects upon initially receiving the vaccine, side effects set in ~8 hours post-vaccination and overall lasted about 24 hours. I have had no additional side effects other than those reported and have felt well since those subsided.

                                                I walked up the stairs to go to bed at 10:45pm and started feeling very dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseous. At the top of the stairs I passed out and fell backwards. Not sure exactly how long I was out, but no more than a few minutes. When I woke up I was disoriented and nauseous but didn&#39;t have the strength to get up. I rolled into my side and vomited 3 times. My fiance helped me get up slowly. He took my temp but I did NOT have a fever. The nausea, dizziness, and lightheadedness subsided after about 10 minutes, so I decided to NOT seek medical attention. This morning I have a headache and body aches in my lower back and left arm.

                                                I had an odd menstrual cycle - the byproduct was a lot more clumpy and clotty than usual. I have typically been having regular cycles for the last few years (28 days), but this one occurred 14 days after the last ended (March 1), and 15 days before the next started (April 5). It lasted a typical amount of time (3 days). I have been feeling more tired than usual. Could be other factors.

                                                The first symptom was a pounding headache which got progressively worse and was also the longest lasting symptom. Fever of 102.5 degrees. Fever lasted approximately 12 hours, and included heavy chills and sweating. Extreme fatigue, weakness, and dizziness. Metallic taste in mouth. Body aches, and especially soreness in the left arm (injection site). Loss of appetite. By 24 hours after the vaccine injection, almost all symptoms were gone, but soreness in left arm persisted. About 26 hours after the vaccine, I had extreme acid reflux which lasted a few hours. In the two days since the vaccine I&#39;ve experienced a ringing in my left ear.

                                                About 8 hours after administration, I got severe muscle aches and chills, such that I was shivering uncontrollably for a few hours, not sure how long. Hurt like nothing I?ve ever experienced before. Considered going to a hospital but couldn?t think of how bc I wasn?t thinking straight. It got a little better around midnight and I could get up enough to take some Advil (I had before when I first felt it coming on), had an intense migraine for the rest of the night but migraines I can deal with. Now I?m just a little dizzy and sore. But that was the worst.

                                                Vaccine was done at 2:50. Around 6pm I started getting a headache, neck pain and my lymph nodes were enlarged. Took 1000mg of Tylenol. At 1030 pm, I started getting all over muscle spasms, headache returned, onset of dizziness, nausea and uncontrollable shaking. At 1145pm, I started vomiting, the muscle spasms got increasing  worse, the shaking only decreased while in the bath tub in very hot water. No fever was noted with thermometer, but after a second dose of 1000mg of Tylenol at 1am, I broke out profusely sweating 30 minutes later.  The uncontrollable shaking stoped at about 4am, along with the nausea and vomiting.  Upon waking up the next day, muscle spasms were still there as well as the headache and dizziness. By end of day 4-10-21 (today) all symptoms have resolved but the headache.

                                                Arm was sore in injection site immediately after injection and has remained sore. Started getting a headache around 6/7pm. Headache got worse and started getting muscle aches all over body around 8/9pm. Skin was very sensitive and tender to the touch (eg touching my arm or brushing up against something). Fever started around 9pm, went up to 101.4°F. Had chills. Trouble sleeping. Now 7:30am the next day and still have body aches and severe headache, but don?t feel as feverish.  Finally took 2 extra strength Tylenol tablets around 7:30am so hopefully that will help.

Slight pain on the injection site, but not horrible. The day after the shot, I feel weak and nauseous.

                                                Patient received Janssen COVID vaccine at a clinic today at approximately 2:10pm.  When seated in a chair in the waiting area, patient stated she started to feel light headed and sweaty and has fainted before (not from a vaccine), so she sat back in the chair and then awoke on the floor.  She bumped her forehead on the floor and has an egg-sized raised bump on her forehead.  We applied ice instantly and monitored her blood pressure until she felt well enough to sit up.  She did not feel she needed an ambulance and refused going to urgent care. She is feeling fine other than the bump.  A worker took a report and I discussed with her what to watch for to monitor for concussion.  Her roommate is driving her home.  Event will also be reported today.

At roughly 9:45 am and again at 11:25 am started throwing up bile/stomach acid.  Flu like symptoms did not subside until morning of 4/13.

Approximately 8 hours after receiving the shot, severe and sudden nausea occurred, causing the patient to violently vomit in the middle of the night.   Patient awoke the next morning, about 15 hours after receiving the shot, with body aches, chills, minor low grade fever, headache, and dehydration. After 24 hours, the patient felt fine.

                                                Around 6pm I started to get a really bad headache and all I wanted to do was lay down because I was getting very tired. About an hour later my entire body was aching and I couldn&#39;t stop shaking with chills. I couldn&#39;t move or turn in my bed without my entire body just hurting. Even the blankets and clothes I had on were hurting my body. I tossed and turned throughout the night. At midnight I woke up to use the bathroom and my face and eyes were hurting. Once I got into my bathroom and looked in the mirror, my face was a little swollen and my eyes were a little puffy. My forehead and cheeks were a little red so I took my temperature and I was running a fever of 102.

Strong pain even from brushing hair when applied to top of left side of scalp. Feeling of pressure being applied to the top of left side of head.

Meanwhile, my sister had the same vaccine at the same time as me (she is 2 years younger), and she had the opposite psychological reaction?weepiness, lack of energy, sadness. These symptoms went away when we went to sleep that night. For the next few days, we had flu-like symptoms (aches, fatigue, intermittent nausea).

                                                Approximately 4 hours after receiving the vaccine, I started getting full body chills which quickly turned into full body shakes. The shaking felt like tremors and made it hard to breathe.  The uncontrollable shaking and chills lasted approx. 3 hours and then I fell asleep. The next morning (approx. 12 hours after the vaccine) I no longer had body shakes but experienced flu-like symptoms (headache, tired, week) for the rest of the day. I also experienced severe pain in my lower back. By the next day (approx. 36 hours after the vaccine) I was back to normal and have felt fine since.

Fever and chills went away after 24 hours. Joint pain and stabbing headache remained for about 48. Currently still bleeding on day 5 and getting occasional sharp headache pains that last around 5 minutes and go away for hours. Joints still feel a lingering ?soreness? almost. Last night, day 4 the cramps that accompanied the bleeding intensified greatly and were very painful. Today I have much more ?period like? cramping still. Previously cramps were there but minimal and occasional.

On Wednesday I went to the Hospital and for chest pain (when I would breathe in), shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, and a fever (on Monday). They rain many tests with chest scans and found all to be clear except I had a ?extremely elevated? white blood cell count. They said they ran blood tests and did not think I had blood clots and they did an MRI and chest x-ray and could not find anything. They sent me home to rest. The rest of the week I had trouble breathing and it slowly started getting better on Friday.

                                                About 9 hours after my vaccine, I developed severe chills for 2 hours and a fever of around 100.1, I also had shortness of breath. After 2 hours, I started experiencing severe body aches (primarily in my knees and back) and a headache, my body temperature felt as thought it was changing from cold to hot frequently, and my temperature rose to 103.6 for about 1.5-2 hours. It finally decreased to about 102 and remained there for about 6 more hours. I had trouble getting up to use the restroom and would feel very dizzy, my temperature dropped midday to about 100. My fever finally broke about 24 hours after my vaccine, but I still lost my appetite and was experiencing body aches and a headache. I couldn&#39;t eat anything for about 48 hours after my vaccine, I was able to take small sips of water to help stay hydrated. It took until Saturday (5 days after my vaccine) to feel back to normal. I felt very puffy and swollen the entire week following my vaccine and was very fatigued.

Most of the symptoms lasted 3-4 days but the extreme fatigue and sore arm lasted for a week. Symptoms were similar to when I had covid, but was surprised that some symptoms lasted a full week. Had to take off work for a few days.

When she  came to the pharmacist gave her some orange juice.  It didn&#39;t help and she  was very nauseous.  When  she got up to leave she was totally incoherent, was unable to walk on her own.  When she got home she was no better so I first called our family doctor which both said take her to the ER.  There they did many tests and they all came back fine so they sent her home.  By that evening she was able to walk on her own and talking right.  She was terribly tired and still today 4/14 she is feeling worse but still not 100%. With the pause today for this vaccine we are very worried about this.

Lotion did not relieve the itch I eventually put ice on them so I was able to sleep.   I woke up 4-19-2021 and felt itchy all over but no noticeable rash. I took my last antibiotic pill around 9 am. By 2:00pm I started getting small ?hives? on my arms. By 4pm my arms were covered and my chest and neck had began to break out.   By the time I reach the urgent care (4:45pm) my back and stomach, and upper legs had become affected also. I received a steroid shot in the muscle of my buttocks.   I got home around 6pm and put cool towels on my legs and eventually the rash was almost completely gone.    I woke up 4/20 around 6am with the chills and goosebumps all over feeling cold, but sweating like crazy. The rash/hives had came back and even worse/covering more of my body than before.  I am now taking  Prednisone 2x per day for the next 7days  starting 4/20 11am

                                                About 7 minutes of receiving my J&amp;J vaccine, I started to feel nauseous while sitting down and waiting for my fifteen minutes of monitoring. I experienced pain in my left arm and my heart was beating fast. My vision was in and out, started seeing black and white spots. I then got up from my chair and I went to the counter and as I was talking to the clerk telling her I did not feel good, I just went down and fainted. I had fainted and when I came back, woke up a nurse was trying t put an epi-pen on me but I told her I did not need it. They called the ambulance and they monitored me there. The EMT said to me that my blood pressure had dropped and I had had a &#34;vasovagal syncope&#34; and that my body probably went into shock. I did not go to the hospital and went home. For the rest of the day I felt ill, and out of it. I also felt pain, an aching pain to the right buttocks region. The next day I still felt not good. Also I have noticed since the J&amp;J vaccine, I had my menstrual cycle but normally my menstrual cycle lasts 5 days now this month it only lasted about 4 hours and I this concerns me.  Before this vaccine, I did not have experience these symptoms.

                                                Patient stated she felt light headed and dizzy.  She put her head down on the table and was sweating.  She did not lose consciousness.  She was able to respond to questions.  She refused the offer of an epi pen or call to 911.  She did not want to have someone called to pick her up.  I gave her a bottle of water and M&amp;M&#39;s.  when the dizziness passed, she ate the M&amp;M&#39;s, had some water.  She started to fell better after about 6 minutes.  I stayed with her until she able to leave on her own.

                                                About 30 seconds after the vaccine was administered the patient collapsed in her chair and began to seize. Prior to the collapse she had asked to sit for a moment and said that she was feeling strange. I stabilized her in the chair until the seizure finished, it lasted about 30 seconds.  I then helped her to the floor and had her sit against the wall.  She was pale and confused but conscious. She complained of head and neck pain, as well as oral pain. She denied seizures in the past, but states that she may have previously had &#34;seizure-like activity&#34;. I asked my technician,  to call 911. Once emergency services was on the way I kept her in the immunization room with the door propped open and got her an apple juice. Then I stayed with her until EMS arrived.   EMS determined that she was stable and stayed with her until family arrived to take her home

                                                I received my vaccine at 5PM on 5/23/21. At 2AM on 5/24/21, I woke up uncontrollably shaking. My arms and legs and jaw were shaking so violently that I put sheets in my mouth to keep from breaking my teeth. I struggled to get to the switch to turn off the ceiling fan but realized that these weren&#39;t shivers from being cold (even though I did feel cold). They felt more like involuntary and rapid muscle contractions. My entire body (abs, legs, arms, jaw) were cramping and in intense pain, and I began to feel panicked. I attempted to control the shaking with deep breathing but this did not help. I took my temperature in my ear and it was 104 degrees. I took a muscle relaxer and Tylenol at about 2:30 AM, and began to feel control over my body at about 3:00AM. I fell asleep around 4:30AM, and my fever had not reduced. I woke up at around 9AM on 5/24/21 and had a splitting headache throughout the day, and was tired/in and out of sleep. I alternated Advil and Tylenol every 4 hours but my fever maintained at 103-104 degrees all day. On 5/25/21 my headache was gone but my fever fluctuated between 102-103 all day, and finally broke around 8PM.  On 5/26/21, I had no fever, but felt chills/overheated easily through the day.

This is when I was taken to the ER and admitted for three days. I had a fever as well.

                                                Until ~5PM adverse events were extremely trivial -- mainly I &#34;felt stupid&#34;. Starting about 5PM, I started feeling bad -- stomachache, strong muscle cramps primarily in the right leg (*not blood clot), and I staggered around dumbly much like a severe fever victim (*I had no actual fever). My period started about a week and a half early (typically only varies by a day or two) and was extremely thick and black, tar-like (typically is bloodlike -- reddish and watery). I did not suffer any unusual amount of period pain.  Symptoms worsened sharply between 9:30-10PM, when I became extremely sensitive to light and sound and lost emotional control almost entirely. From 10PM to 4 or 5 AM, in pitch dark and total silence, I laid in my bed raging at the &#39;excessive brightness and noise&#39;.   The next day (5/2) my emotional state returned almost to normal, but I was still &#34;stupid&#34;, and the leg cramps continued. I spent most of the day sleeping. I also drank obscene amounts of tea that I didn&#39;t urinate out, so I would assume that if I wasn&#39;t chugging tea like a frat boy on a keg during spring break, I would have suffered dehydration.  On 5/3 my mental state returned basically to normal. The leg cramps continued. Presumptive dehydration period ended.  On 5/4 the leg cramps began to subside, and my period became more normal (bloodlike, watery). On 5/5 the leg cramps and period ended.

I took tylenol (acetaminophen 500mg) and two glasses of water. As the night progressed, my lower back started to hurt and my headache continued to progress. I went to bed early to sleep it off but was woken up by overheating and headache. I took more tylenol around 3am and grabbed an icepack, this seemed to help alleviate the symptoms.

I have had multiple blood test work ups and the only &#34;solution&#34; anyone was able to provide to me is that I was slightly vitamin B12 deficent. I have been taking supplements for the past month and have not seen a significant increase in my symptoms. It has been three months and I still have the visual disturbances, and no answers. Prior to the vaccine, I was a healthy young women without health issues.
