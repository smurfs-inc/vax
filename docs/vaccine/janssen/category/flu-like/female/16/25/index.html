                                                Minutes after I got the vaccine I started to lose hearing in my left ear (it sounded like I was under water) which slowly spread to my right ear as well. My hands and feet went numb and I started sweating all over. I felt sick to my stomach and I felt like I was above the whole situation-- I could hear the people talking but I felt like I was somewhere else. After resting my head on the table for about 10 minutes I felt better and was able to move to a cot where I rested for another 20 minutes or so until I felt pretty much back to normal. I was treated by the medical team at the site who cleared me to go home.

Patient got my attention a few minutes later saying she felt dizzy. As i was guiding her back to the chair she passed out and i guided her to the floor. In a few minutes she was able to sit upright in the chair. EMS was called and she later went to hospital for further evaluation.

Woke up @12:30am with chills, a headache, soreness in the injection site, and body aches in the neck, back and legs.  Got up and tried stretching and drinking water. Stoped drinking water when I felt nauseas. Did not throw up. Took Ibuprofen and melatonin before falling asleep about 30 minutes after taking the medication. Woke up @3:00am and chills were gone, only left with pain in the knees and injection site. Wasn?t able to sleep until around 4:45am. When I woke up @7:45 am, I still had slight pain in the knees, I took Tylenol @10:45 am. Pain was on and off throughout the day. I took a hot bath, that helped the pain tremendously. Fatigue throughout the day. After sleeping the day after the shot, all symptoms are gone, only soreness in the injection site.

                                                I felt really good until late at night when I got a pretty mild headache, then I started shivering and I didn&#39;t stop for nearly an hour. My muscles were very tense and the headache got worse. I took ibuprophen and that seemed to help with the shivering and lessen the headache. It is now the morning after and I just have a mild, but persistent headache and skin sensitivity which I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related to getting the vaccine or not.

                                                Patient had seizure-like activity about 10 minutes after receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid Vaccine. Nurse saw her eyes rolling back and struggling to breath. She was placed on her side until wheelchair was brought to her side and then transferred to wheelchair and taken to the ER.  While in transit she regained consciousness and was lethargic but was responding appropriately to questions. Patient was checked by Dr.  and his review was tachycardic and mild dyspnea. Skin was pink and warm. She was taken to the ER for further evaluation.

                                                Within 5-10 minutes after receiving vaccine, patient began to become very pale.  Her symptoms included dizziness, syncope, stomach ache, foaming at the mouth, vision disturbances.  911 was called and paramedics arrived..  Her vital signs were all normal.  Patient did not wish to go to hospital, and her mother took her home.  Other pertinent information is that patient has a history of seizures and had been off of her seizure medication for 4 weeks.  I believe that I understood her mother to say that her neurologist knew she was getting the vaccine today.  Patient reported no allergies to any other vaccine, medication, or other.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after injection, I woke up after sleeping for an hour with excruciating pain in all of my limbs, especially the injection site. I could not move any of my limbs. Not because of pain, I simply could not move them. I had a fever (temp not recorded, I could only tell because I was burning up.) I was very nauseous, but never vomited. I was shaking very hard and had the chills despite being covered by a blanket and simultaneously burning up. Both of my ankles that I had suffered a running injury to several weeks ago (I have an upcoming doctor&#39;s appointment to get them checked out) were pulsing with pain. I developed a minor headache. Eventually I either drifted back to sleep or stayed awake, because I don&#39;t remember anything up until around 5am when I was able to get up and take Tylenol and water. All symptoms were gone except for the minor headache.

                                                I felt completely normal after getting the vaccine. Then at 8 pm (5 hours after getting it) I felt heat rushing to my head and face. I became very weak in my legs and I had to lay down. I took ibuprofen at 9 pm because my body aching was very intense. I woke up at 11:30 pm with such terrible body aches I could not sleep and I was crying from the pain. I had freezing chills and a throbbing headache. When I tried to stand up, I almost fell over because I felt so light-headed. I thought I was going to faint. I was so concerned about the amount of pain I was in that I called my doctor and public safety came and checked on me. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed for 3 hours. I drank Gatorade and took more ibuprofen. I was able to check my temperature. I had a 101-103 degree fever.  The entire next day (Tuesday) I took ibuprofen every six hours. My body was still very weak and aching everywhere as well as a headache. I stayed in bed the entire day. Today (Wednesday) I feel much better??both of my arms still ache a lot and my body feels exhausted.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Symptoms started yesterday, March 9th, with muscle aches in my lower back a couple hours after receiving the shot. The muscle aches spread throughout my body as time went on, and joint pain and headaches came as the muscle aches worsened. I took two ibuprofens, though they had no effect. A bit later in the day, I developed a fever and felt very nauseous. When I went to sleep, I had a hard time staying asleep and ended up vomiting when I woke up at around 1:00AM. Today, March 10th, I continue to have muscle aches, joint pain, a headache, and slight nausea.

                                                I received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EAU at 1:45 PM. I was very tired around 8:30 PM, so I went to bed. I never fell fully asleep and began feeling worse at 11:00 PM. I had a fever of 101.5 F, chills, muscle spasms, anxiety, shortness of breath, and could not stop crying. This lasted until approx. 4 AM when I finally fell asleep. The next morning I woke up feeling much better. But, for the next 5 days, I have had on-and-off low-grade fevers between 99F and 100F.

                                                Roughly six hours after receiving the vaccine, I began to get the chills, and I couldn&#39;t stop shaking. Roughly an hour to an hour and a half later, the chills/shaking stopped, only to be replaced by a fever. My temperature shot up, my ears began to ring, and my head began to pound. When I tried to eat, I felt sick to my stomach.   My fever lasted for the entire evening, and I spent most of the night alternating between chills and heat flashes. My head continued to pound, and whenever I tried to sit up, I felt dizzy. At around 4am, I awoke with an upset stomach, diarrhea, and further dizziness.   By around 8-9am, my fever had subsided, and I was beginning to feel a bit better. However, I have been feeling physically drained and a little achy today (03/26).

Day 2 a bit better but still low grade fever of 101 degrees, nausea, weak, body aches but not as bad. In the evening around 5pm noticed ears starting to enlarge but didn&#39;t think much of it, by morning today at 7:30am I felt my face was swollen and numb on the right side. Now both ears were swollen and the area in my face was red. When I took my temperature on my forehead I was normal however the swollen cheek was 102 degrees. At that point I went to urgent care to get it looked out.  Currently at 6:30pm on 4/3/2021 the redness in my cheek has turn back to normal however the face is still swollen but not as bad.

My heart rate  would barely stay below 100 BPM, even when laying down in bed. I developed a 102 F fever last night and took motrin, which helped lower it but I?ve also been having lingering throbbing headaches. My heart rate went to about 100-105 when while I took a nap but as soon as I got up and moved it jumped to 117, in the morning I went to use the bathroom and did nothing else and just that made it jump to 160. I have no trouble breathing. I was sitting in bed eating and my heart rate was around 123-130

When I was called to help her, she had fainted.  She was able to slowly respond to us and was breathing.   We placed her on the floor laying on her side.  A cold compress was placed on the back of her neck and a pillow was placed under her head.  9-1-1 was called.  When EMS responded, she had normal blood pressure and blood sugar, but was still feeling &#34;out of it&#34;.  She was place on a stretcher and taken to the ambulance, but did not get transported.  She had a family member pick her up from the clinic.  She was able to walk from the ambulance to the car on her own.

When observing her, she appeared like she was going to fall over so I had her mom help me put her on her back. 911 was called and I took her blood pressure and it was 80/49 mmHg. She remained conscious and EMS took her to ED for observation. She was given liquids, discharged and told to come back if she had any other symptoms. Per her mother, she had not ate or drank anything prior to receiving the shot.

After about 5 minutes I checked on her and she said she was feeling very dizzy.  I called management for assistance and got her ice packs for neck and forehead. I took her blood pressure and it was 150/90, HR 73. We laid her down and elevated her legs.  She said that she felt some pressure in her chest but she had pulled a muscle there the day before and wasn&#39;t sure if it was related.  She said the room was spinning as she continued to lay on the ground and it was not improving.  Her blood pressure was taken about 5 minutes later and it was 143/85 HR 73.  She said it is usually low.   She had no signs of local reaction, hives, or swelling.  She complained of nausea.  After a few more minutes she said she was not feeling any better and was having pain in her throat and difficulty breathing.  I asked her to try to take a deep breath and she was gasping for air, unable to breathe deeply.  I administered epinephrine (one dose) and called 911.  I rechecked blood pressure while waiting for paramedics and it was 125/80.  She was taken to hospital when they arrived.  Her mom arrived shortly before the ambulance and went with her.  Pt never lost consciousness.  Management followed up with patient this evening and patient is home and well, but the ER did classify the event as an allergic reaction.

Around 4:00 am, the worst migraine, I have ever had that encased my whole head, lasted for about 12 hours with hot flashes. After the migraine, my body and head is sensitive to rapid motion and loud noises.

                                                Within the hour after receiving shot, migraine formed along with fatigue. Both progressively got worse through out that day(4/7/21). On 4/8/21 I woke up many times through out the night with a migraine that felt as though my brain was burning and sinus pressure, causing immense eye sensitivity. Throughout the night I became increasingly more sweaty, but didn?t have the proper thermometer to take my temperature.  I took ibuprofen (at 6:45 AM on 4/8/21) which helped those two side effects subside (around 8 AM). Fatigue has been constant throughout both days. Around 5:00 PM on 4/8/21 I ate broccoli and rice for dinner, small amounts, and encountered bad diarrhea. It lasted for about half an hour. Migraine is reduced significantly (at 6:41 PM), but there is slight nausea, weakness, and fatigue.

I tried falling asleep but my fever got worse, chills worsened, I developed body aches, and I got a massive headache. I ended up not being able to get any sleep at all during the entire night because I was in so much pain. I felt tightness in my chest, stomach pains, super sore joints, and my body aches and headache kept getting worse and worse. When I got up to go use the bathroom I could barely walk because I felt so weak and was super dizzy. Later into the night my legs felt like pins and needles as if they were starting to go numb. I still have a fever, body aches, and a headache.

                                                5 hours after the vaccine, I started having a sore arm at the injection sight and a low grade fever of 100.0 with chills and I was uncontrollably shaking. I took ibuprofen at 8:00pm. That night at about 9:00 my fever was 100.8 and I felt extreme fatigue.  I woke up at 3:30am feeling both extremely hot and cold with a bad headache and my temperature was 101.5. I took ibuprofen again at 3:30am. I then woke up at 5:15 am with a horrible headache and was very hot and sweating. I put cold compresses on my forehead and back of my neck which helped. The entire night, my arm with the injection site was very painful and stiff to move.

Lots of pain and soreness at injection site. Had a severe headache the next morning (relieved with acetaminophen), and had a difficult time seeing up close for about two hours despite using my corrective lenses, which made the headache worse.

Moments after (less than 2 minutes) giving her the vaccine, I was giving another family member the injection and patient asked if she could take her mask off. I turned around and she was very pale. She took her mask off and started slumping in her seat. She was taking deep breaths and reported no difficulties breathing. She then became ill and began gagging, at which point I gave her the trash receptacle to vomit in. I had a technician grab the patient a water and packet of crackers. After half an hour of resting in the chair, monitoring her breathing, blood pressure, heart rate, and getting some food and water into her system, she appeared and reported to feel back to normal. Patient&#39;s family member mentioned she had a similar reaction a few weeks ago when getting blood drawn at her doctor&#39;s office.

                                                Immediately after receiving vaccine, a cold, tingling, transient sensation was experienced radiating from the site of the injection up into the neck. Roughly 6 hours after injection (1 a.m., 3/9/2021) severe chills were experienced for approximately two and a half hours, preventing sleep. Patient experienced dizziness. spO2 was within normal limits. Temperature was measured w/ oral thermometer to be 101.3 degrees farenheit at 4:55 a.m. in the morning on 3/9/2021.  Treatment was a single dose of ibuprofen at roughly 8 a.m. (3/9/21). Pt. continued to experience fatigue and sporadic chills, with gradual abatement of symptoms over the course of the day. Pt. had no symptoms the following Wednesday (3/10/21). Pt. experienced symptoms the following Thursday (3/11/21), with a sudden onset of intense stomach pain (8/10 on NRS) starting at approximately noon. Stomach pain was more similar to muscle cramps (with aching quality) than nausea. Other symptoms included fatigue and some feverish experiences (such as chills). Treatment was conservative (ginger tea, peppermint candies, rest). Temperature taken that evening via oral thermometer (roughly 7pm, 3/11/21) was 101.4 degrees farenheit.  Symptoms were significantly reduced the following morning, Friday 3/12/21. Temperature taken approximately 10 a.m. was within normal limits.

I went to the walk in clinic at CVS on Saturday because I was still feeling fatigue, headache, nose bleeds (I was having them before the vaccine about a week before) and sinus congestion, they antibiotics and I was able to get started on them on the same day. I still feel the fatigue, congestion and the sinus pressure/headache. The fever and chills are gone.

Today I am still extremely fatigued and have a bad headache and dizziness. This was not relieved by the maximum dose of Tylenol.

                                                The first night I had a severe headache, but it was gone the next day, had no symptoms until yesterday, March 18th, after waking up with a huge rash all over my upper thighs and stomach, and the next day, March 19th, it had spread to my arms, and further down my legs, and is starting to spread to my face. No rash has appeared at the injection site, which led me to believe this wasn&#39;t a result of the vaccine, but I have made any behavior or diet changes, and have no known allergies, so the only thing I could think to cause the rash was due to the vaccine. I am not saying at all that this means I regret getting the vaccine, I just thought it would be responsible of me to report these symptoms, in case others were experiencing a delayed rash and was concerned. The rash hasn&#39;t caused any distress other than existing, there&#39;s no itching or pain from it, it just keeps spreading fairly rapidly.

                                                At 4:00pm I got lightheaded, dizzy, and achy. The lightheadedness was such that my heart was pounding, vision was lost for a second (similar to the effect when you stand up too fast), and the sound went out for a second. Around 7:00 I got chills, a 101 degree F fever, and headache. The chills, fever, and headache lasted throughout the night, but they were gone in the morning. The entire day after getting the vaccine, 4/1/2021, I had a metallic taste in my mouth. By the morning of 4/2/2021 the metallic taste was gone.

                                                It started with my teeth chattering and chills, but no fever yet. All of the muscles in my body had a severe tremor, and I had trouble with simple tasks like filling my nasal rinse bottle, because the tremor was so bad. My jaw was smacking the entire time, so hard that the headboard smacked against the blinds. Then I checked my temperature and it had gone from 97.5 to about 99.5. The symptoms got worse, and added in excessive thirst, pain at the base of my head where it meets my neck, pressure under and behind the eyes, severe lower back pain, muscle pain escalating on the right side of my body only, nausea, pain across the top of my forehead, and a weird heat sensation under my fingernails? Maybe and hour or so passed, and my fever rose to above 101, and I tried to go back to sleep. By this point the tremors were over, but slight chills and every other symptoms remained. I took my temp later and it was 102.7, and I again had all symptoms except the initial tremors. I also had tachycardia (super rapid heartbeat) and got dizzy for a second and have a little trouble focusing my vision when I sat up in bed.

We called 9-1-1 to check vitals and they recommended going to her doctor or the hospital in case of additional swelling.  We called the doctor and they told us to try Benadryl.  This worked a little bit, but she is still in a lot of discomfort today (Saturday after Thursday shot).

She sat with her head against the wall and dropped her phone and passed out for just a moment.  She had a slight tremor/shake for a few seconds. (I did not witness, unsure exactly what happened or how long)   She came too fairly quickly after being yelled at, are you ok?  When she regained consciousness she complained of being hot all over for a bit.  We gave her ice packs to cool down.  She felt hot for maybe 10-15 minutes, but felt relief with the ice packs.  She also drank some sips of cool water which seemed to help her cool down.

                                                2-3 days following the vaccine, a series of small hives appeared along the left side of body.  Specifically on the left shoulder and left hip. They appear as small bug bites and are very itchy. They are hot to the touch and only slightly risen.   Additionally, at around 10 hours following the vaccine, I experienced severe muscle aches and chills (but this was listed as a typical side effect).

Around 4:15 I had to lay down because I believe the shivering was exacerbating my aching.

                                                I have chronic tension headaches and yesterday my headache wouldn&#39;t go away even with over the counter medication. I felt overall achy but still able to get up and do what I needed to do. Once I went to bed though, I woke up around 2:00a sweating, achy, and with a fever. I couldn&#39;t fall back asleep very easily and once I woke up around 7:00a I confirmed I had a fever. I am currently still bedridden with a fever, complete body aches, and slight feelings of nausea. As of right now it is 8:56a 04/06/21 and the symptoms haven&#39;t gotten any better. I haven&#39;t taken any medication since 04/05/21 at 6:15p ish, which was to treat my headache from yesterday.

Did not require further treatment like lying on the ground or applying cold compresses to wrists and neck. We monitored her for 30 minutes instead of 15 minutes to make sure she was safe to go.

She said she felt fully back to normal by the time she left with the person she came with (her mom).

When I woke up at 7 am I became very faint about 10 minutes after getting up and walking around; it sounded like I was underwater, I had tunnel vision, I could not speak coherently, and I was sweating. This subsided about 15 minutes after laying on the cold floor with a cold towel.  The faintness completely disappeared after an hour

Later, I started getting really cold and shivering, and there was nothing I could do to make it stop. I started getting a headache, nausea, and weakness around that time too, maybe a bit sooner, like 3:00pm. The chills  started at around 5:00pm.

                                                Hives on my arms and stomach developed within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine at 2:16. I left the facility after 30 minutes because the hives did not get any worse and I did not experience any other symptoms. At home about 8 hours later, I started feeling exhausted, weak, and my body was literally shaking whenever I stood. Overnight, I felt feverish, I had the worst nightmares, and woke up every few hours. On Friday (next day) I felt dizzy whenever I moved, nauseous whenever I stood, and once when I was standing too long I started vomiting.  On Friday evening I went to a local ER (all the urgent cares were closed) at my primary care Dr?s suggestion to ensure that I wasn?t having an allergic reaction to the vaccine. The ER determined that the hives were likely an allergic reaction but all other symptoms were reactions due to the vaccine.

                                                Around 10PM I was on the phone and felt the body aches start. About an hour or so later it started to get pretty painful, my joints. I was trying to go to sleep and I started with chills. I had a heating pad and 2 blankets and was still shivering, I took my temp and it was 102.4F. I took some Tylenol and was able to sleep and woke up in the middle of the night sweating. Next morning I was again with 102.7F fever. I slept most o the day, and when awake I noticed the body aches were still present. Kept taking Tylenol. Next day my left ear started feeling to hurt and it felt like fluid. I decided to go get checked and that is when they told me I had an inner and outer ear infection. After meds were prescribed (oral antibiotics and ear drops) the swelling has been going down a lot and it is not as near as painful.

I was warmer than normal but did not have a full fever. I was extremely fatigued. Most of these symptoms subsided in about 24 hours with acetaminophen. I am still having occasional (every other day) mild headaches and shortness of breath, heaviness in the chest, and a couch that have persisted 5 days so far.

The chills lasted for around 4 hours, and eventually my fever went away with it. I shook so hard my back, and my joints started to ache. I couldn&#39;t sleep because I was having hallucinations from the fever and the pain would wake me up every hour, I also had a headache. The next day my back still hurts, my head still hurts despite medication, the shaking has subsided. Yet I&#39;m sweating, I&#39;m still very weak, I can&#39;t stand up without getting super dizzy or experiencing extreme fatigue. If I think of food I feel as if I&#39;m going to vomit just drinking too much water can make me ill.

                                                EXTREME FATIGUE, chills and fever of 101.5, upset stomach and wanting to get sick.  Got shot in afternoon and felt bad before bed, then was really hot, had extreme chills, had a fever, and upset stomach the next morning.  Stayed in bed for the day, was thirsty and really hot.  Within 24 hours I felt completely fine...but just felt hot still and then that went away after 2 days.

                                                I had chills and a fever starting at 5 pm the day of the injection and those broke sometime in the middle of the night. I experienced some stomach discomfort but was not nauseous. However, in the middle of the night, I went to drink water and after the smallest sip I threw up everything in me. When I would use the restroom to poop I would feel a large pressure in my head, but only then and I also experienced muscular pain in my back. I was able to relieve symptoms with Advil. The fever and stomach discomfort was over by 3 am on 3/28. The chills came and went until mid-day on 3/28 and I believe that was with help of the Advil. The occasional pressure in my head only lasted until mid-day 3/28 and the back pain did not go away until the morning of 3/29. Following the vaccine I felt very dehydrated and while I drink lots of water, I had to increase my intake to even more than normal and this feeling was over by the evening of 3/28.  As of today, 3/29 I feel back to 100%.

I had a bad headache and was achy, which I know were listed as possible side effects. A few hours later, I started to have a severe burning sensation all over my body. It felt similar to the sensation when your skin gets extremely sensitive to any touch, but was magnified 10x over, and was over every inch of my body. There was no rash, and I did not have a chill as though I had a fever, although my skin was warm to the touch. I took 2 500 mg tablets of extra-strength Tylenol, and the symptoms did not improve at all.

                                                Around 9pm was very tired with small headache. Went to bed at 10pm and laid there for an hour and a half with my head pounding and burning. I?ve never been able to feel a fever on myself?it was so high. I also had major chills the whole time. I?d get up and hydrate and took 2 Advil around 12:30pm as no sign of sleep was coming. I put ice packs on my hot head for an hour with no relief. Meanwhile my heart rate was steadily above 100 for the whole night until about 4am when my fever went down and I was able to sleep till 7am. I thought I was going to die it was so hot and painful and pounding. In the morning the fever is gone and I am extremely tired. Currently not recommending people get the vaccine.

                                                I first noticed that I was extremely cold and could not get warm at about 11 pm on the evening of my vaccine. I then realized it was getting worse, and I was shivering uncontrollably despite sitting in front of a space heater in warm clothing and wrapped in a blanket. I checked for a fever, but my temp was only 99. I fell asleep around 1 am, and woke up at 5 am (3/8/21) to a splitting headache, extreme thirst, slight nasal congestion, muscle soreness, fatigue, and nausea. These symptoms feel almost identical to the symptoms I experienced when I contracted COVID-19 in September 2020 at my university.

Severe flu like symptoms (9 out of 10 on a pain scale, 10 being extremely painful): body aches and pains and low fever. Took both acetaminophen and ibuprofen to counteract the pains (did not help much). These symptoms lasted through March 9, 2021. Today is March 10, 2021 and my symptoms are feeling moderately faint and lethargic.

Pain in my muscles all over from hours of full body chills. The chills stopped after two hours at which point an uncontrolled fever set in. Highest temp recorded was 103. Severe full body muscle pain prevented me from getting up or drinking water on my own. Small movements like sitting up or rolling over to relieve muscle pain resulted in sudden and severe nausea. Considered going to a hospital to bring down the fever and hydrate. After two more hours of applying cold compresses, the fever decreased to 100 at which point I slept it off for six hours.  Prolonged bouts of dizziness, dehydration and nausea over the following two days.

                                                The night of my vaccine date (6 hours after) I was fatigued and started a fever with chills and acheyness which kept me in bed all night. I got up to shower and get some food as I was going upstairs I grew very faint,  my vision grew black and my hearing faded. I was able to make it to my bed then ask for some help. After taking Tylenol, my fever began to be very hot instead of chills. I was able to fall asleep until I woke back up to chills again and taking more medicine.  The next morning, I was still dizzy when I walked around but the fever was gone. I was still very fatigued which made me unable to go to class or work. Day 3 I was back to my normal self.

                                                Originally, I started with random muscle aches in my left shoulder then it went down my back (a few hours after receiving vaccine). Then slightly fogginess and at night the muscle pain became worse making it difficult to sleep and started getting cold flashes. Once asleep around 12:30 I started getting muscle aches that felt like they were burning and in random spots on body along with a headache and would get random cold and heat flashes. Kept yelling out in pain all night and increased tremors in hands. Boyfriend noticed I had a fever as well and gave me ibuprofen around 3am since pain was unbearable and was difficult to sleep. Almost took me to the hospital due to the intense pain.. In morning slightly better but still frontal lobe pain and aches throughout body with raised heart rate. Cannot do much or else aches get worse including headache.

I had also drank some ginger and lemon tea before bed due to stomach upset (however I believe that may be linked to my history of digestion issues that are currently going under diagnosis linked to lactose intolerance and food sensitivity). 12:00 AM 3/12/2021: I started to experience a headache, muscular aches, and chills continuing. I made myself a cup of mint tea for the warmth and the addition of the stomach settling aspect of mint.  12:15 AM 3/12/2021: I had a bowel movement and the nausea and stomach upset and gas has begun to pass (making me think that portion is linked to non-related issues of the vaccine, but wanted to note in case your professional opinion thought otherwise!). Chills, aches, and headache still continuing with little shift in extremity. 12:30 AM 3/12/2021

Today I am feeling better but I?m still extremely tired even after restarting my adderall.

I had a mild fever, severe body aches, severe headache, nausea, fatigue, etc. For the entire day of 3/13 I was pretty much bed ridden. Around 5pm on the 13th I took Tylenol and felt a little better and was able to eat something and fall asleep that night. I woke up on the 14th with just a sore arm where I received the shot.

                                                Around 10pm on 3/26, I got a slight headache, but I am not sure if it was due to screen time or a vaccine side effect. Per the clinician that administered the shot, I took 2 tabs of Tylenol (one normal adult dose) with water and went to bed. At 1 am on 3/27, I woke up incredibly sore all over but especially in my joints. I was shivering badly and woke up in a tightly curled fetal position. I was unable to lie still or warm up. I eventually went back to sleep and woke up at 5 am, this time with extreme nausea and threw up everything I had eaten the day before. This went on for a couple of minutes. I was still shivering constantly and sore and achy everywhere. Especially in my knees, shoulders, and lower back. At 6 am, I was still awake and while I still had chills, my face felt hot and I took my temperature twice. First getting 100.74 then 100.86. Slept deeply for the rest of the night. At noon on 3/27 I woke up with no nausea,  body aches but only in my joints but with general soreness everywhere (like after a good workout) and a temp still in the 100.7 degree range. I took 2 Tylenol tabs at 2pm. At 4pm, I only had slight body aches, a headache, and a slight brain fog left and my temp was at 98.7, so no more fever. No further problems showed  up and when I woke up at 9 am on 3/28, I felt absolutely fine other than soreness at the injection site and a little chest tightness which last for about 2 days, through 3/30.

                                                Patient came in for Janssen COVID vaccine that was scheduled electronically online.  All appropriate prescreening was done and patient had no previous allergies or issues.  Patient was instructed to sit in one of the chairs designated for post vaccine observation for 15 minutes after her vaccine.  Within a minute or so  patient felt light headed and like she might pass out. She notified the technician who was right there and he notified me.  I assisted her to a sitting position on the floor from her chair and I was able to ease her back to a lying down position from there with her head on the floor and feet elevated above heart on a chair.  Patient was able to talk the whole time.  She told us at that point when she was younger she was scared of shots and had fainted when having them, but thought she was past that and did not mention it during screening. She said she was surprised to feel this way because she was so excited about getting her COVID vaccine.  She had not eaten much today (a small snack) and had rushed here for her appointment without getting food. I checked her blood pressure while she was lying down and it was 94/63 and pulse of 75.  She said she normally had lower end of normal blood pressure.   She was pale when I started checking her, but her color began to return to normal within minutes. After 5 minutes she felt well enough to sit up and we got her a granola bar and water.  She remained this way for 5 minutes and felt good, so we moved her to sitting in a chair and got her a pepperoni and cheese snack tray from the cafe.  She ate this and waited for 10minutes and felt good. We walked her to her car and she felt fine.  I called to verify she got home fine and she did.

                                                Came down with a 100.2 degree F fever the night I got it, which went away after one dose of tylenol. The following night I did have a low grade fever of 99.3, which also went away after one dose of tylenol. I have had muscular soreness, and am now developing a small, itchy, red patch at the injection site. I will fill out another adverse form if it gets worse.

I had severe chills and shakes, body aches, and a headache. It eventually turned into sweating. Around 8:30am, it&#39;s not as severe. I took tylenol around 8:30 am and do not feel like I have the chills anymore, just body aches and some fatigue.

                                                Sunday night, my heart started pounding really hard. I went to ER - Medical Center. They did an EKG and took my vitals. I had a fever (slight) and chills and was nauseous. Put  ONDANSETRON -4 mg. The nausea didn&#39;t go away and I couldn&#39;t eat or drink without vomiting until today. I couldn&#39;t eat or drink or was very tired and groggy and miserable. Today I  had another trip to the ER Medical, I got on an antibiotic and anti-nausea medication (GETHALEXIN - 500 mg for the GI) (METOCLOPRAMIGE HCL - 5 mg-  for nausea) from the hospital and I had a shot that went into my immune system. They also found a UTI today.

Over the course of the day these symptoms started increasing and I developed chills and a fever around 100F at about 7 hours. Took an ibuprofen when symptoms persisted and fever kept rising.  Fever rose to over 101F while sleeping and woke me up once the ibuprofen ran its course. Did some wet towel compresses but did not help. Took another ibuprofen.   Muscle aches and chills persisted into the next day. Developed another mild fever in the second day. Symptoms resolved on day 3. Soreness in arm where the vaccine was administered persists.

The first reaction lasted half an hour. After taking two Benadryl tablets and Abuterol every four hours, the throat swelling calmed down. I still had difficulty breather for the following two days, but my Abuterol kept it at bay.

Also, I had pain at the site of the injection. I felt very nauseous. These symptoms persisted from hour 8 to 44 hours after receiving the shot.

                                                Felt cramps in my lower abdomen, then in my mid back. Put heat on my back. Then I started to feel very nauseous and light headed, dizzy. Shortly felt a burning feeling in my chest and  collar bones, that spread to my head. My head started to burn, it felt like it was on fire, along with my neck and chest. I felt dizzy, like i was going to faint, the burning and dizziness lasted for about 5 minutes. Shortly after i felt like my throat closed up and I was having very labored breaths. The burning feeling in my body and dizziness came back, along with not feeling like i could breathe well. I went to an ER, they gave me an IV with Benadryl, and I started to feel well enough 2 hours later to go home.

                                                About 5 hours after my vaccine I had already been asleep for around 30 minutes when I was startled awake by my own rapid heartbeat, it was beating so fast and hard that I could hear it and it woke me up. I reviewed my literature about the vaccine I received at the pharmacy and saw this reaction could be due to an allergic reaction but as an uninsured person I had to just wait it out to see if it would go away. I drank a lot of water and started developing a headache but my heart rate finally slowed down enough that I was no longer alarmed, but it was still faster than usual. I went back to sleep around 2am only to awake once again around 5am because I had begun to experience the worst body aches I?ve ever felt as well as nausea and a pounding headache. I live on a semi truck with no bathroom so my fiancé had to take me to my parents house so I would have access to a bathroom. I took ibuprofen and Tylenol for my pain and took 6 showers in 24 hours just to soothe my body aches. It felt worse than any flu I?ve ever had (I received the flu vaccine back in January if that matters). I was extremely ill and had no appetite and pretty much just slept and cried for about 36 hours total, but yesterday afternoon I finally felt a little better although still experiencing a terrible headache. Today I woke up feeling completely fine. I just wanted to report my side effects.

Continued to vomit all day probably because of the fever.  Gave liquids only. By 9:00 pm fever fluctuating 99 to normal.  Hopefully by 4/2 all symptoms will have passed.  I did not take her to the doctor for this although when the symptoms started I was very concerned because she does not speak and I didn?t know if she was having chest pains.

                                                I ran a 103.5 fever for over two hours. I am still running a 100 fever. I have maxed out on my dosage of ibuprofen and tylenol.

                                                I passed out in my bathroom the morning after the vaccine shot around 5:30am. I called the doctors and they said that was unrelated to the vaccine, but I had intense dizziness and tinnitis before I passed out. I was incredibly fatigued all day long for the rest of the day and had a migraine - both to be expected. However, I am 3 weeks post-vaccine (April 3) and have been having intense muscle cramping and fatigue in my legs during exercise. I wake up with muscle soreness that goes away throughout the day and then comes back during exercise.

                                                At approximately 0945 this nurse witnessed patient sitting in the observation area with her head tilted to the left side and her body leaning to the left. The medical assistant was with her holding her body up. Her eyes were closed and she had no color to her face and lips. She was not able to respond to questions being asked. As her head was shaking she was making grunting noises. She was diaphoretic and tremulous. This episode lasted for approximately 60 seconds. Pt then opened her eyes and was able to respond to questions asked but with a delayed response. Pt was moved to the stretcher to lay down. Her color came back to her lips and her blood pressure improved. She was responding to questions appropriately. Pt was diaphoretic for approximately 10 minutes. Ice packs and water were provided. Pt was observed by the medical assistant for 30 minutes. Her HOB was elevated gradually until she was able to dangle her feet and sit on the side of the stretcher.  Pt stated that she was feeling better and was ready to go be with her roommate.    Vital signs were taken and BP 91/54, HR 70, O2 97%.  At 0952 HR was 62. 1005 BP 102/67, HR 57 O2 99%.

                                                At around 9:15 PM I started to feel nauseous and got out of bed to go to the bathroom. While using the bathroom I felt a very strong chill come over my whole body and started shivering and got directly back into bed and wrapped myself up in a thick blanket. For 45 minutes I laid wrapped up and was shivering constantly. At 10 pm I was brought extra blankets and a heating pad but moving to get situated caused dizziness. It was about 10:30 when the shivering stopped. I was able to sleep but got up to go got the bathroom around midnight and my entire body was drained of energy and I felt that I could barely stand and walk on my own. I was dizzy and my head hurt as well. I could barely hold my arms up to look at my phone briefly. Between 11 PM and 2 AM I had 5 or 6 high heart rate alerts (over 120) according to my Apple Watch but I did not wake up to them. In the morning (Sunday 4/4/21) around 9-10 am my head still hurt and my body was very achy and I felt very hungover. All day I continued to feel achy almost with a bad cold or a minor flu. Today has been better but I have still felt pretty drained. I?ve had continuous arm soreness in the arm I got the injection - but nothing too severe.   15 minutes after my vaccine on Saturday 4/3/21 I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and around midnight of that night I took 2 of pain relief PM acetaminophen (1000 mg of acetaminophen total snd 50 mg of diphenhydramine HCI total)

Then I started feeling cold chills, and had to lie down in bed for the rest of the day.  Slight fever also occured and intense body aches. However, these slowly subsided after taking tylenol at about 6PM. I slept through the night and outside of feeling a little lethargic the next day, I was back to normal.

                                                Started developing a headache about 2/3 hours after the vaccine. Took some ibuprofen, at 7:11am I still have a severe headache being treated by otc pain reliever. About 2:30am I woke up from my headache and realized I was freezing cold, dispute it being 74 degrees in my house. I did not have a fever but I had extreme chills, my entire body shivering and shaking at some points. This made it hard to stand or even get some water. These lasted about 2 hours or so. Once I was able to get warm again, under several blankets and a heated blanket they did go away and  I did not experience them again.

Woke up around 1AM with severe chills and body aches, tried to keep cool and took temperature around 2:30AM - it was at 100.4. Took Motrin at this time and took temperature again at 3:15AM, it was 101.2. It finally started to go down around 3:45AM and was 100.8. I was able to fall back asleep and didn&#39;t wake up until 10AM. I have had a bad headahce all day on 04/08 and have to keep alternating Tylenol and Motrin to keep fever down. Also very lethargic all day and slept most of the day.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccine (04/05/2021), I became very tired, but otherwise had no adverse reactions. I went to bed around 9 pm, and at around 3 am the next morning (04/06/2021), I woke up with severe chills, body aches, a pressure headache, and some mild nausea (I believe caused by the headache) that lasted through until early afternoon. Taking ibuprofen seemed to help the body and headaches, but it seemed like it was difficult to regulate my body temperature. I couldn&#39;t tell if I was too hot or too cold, and trying to remedy one or the other made me either too cold or too hot, respectively. All effects completely cleared up by 04/07/2021.

                                                Within seconds of receiving the vaccine I began to feel slightly dizzy. By the time I walked across the room to the observation table I was feeling lightheaded. They sat me down, gave me water and a cookie, but about 2min after the injection the dizziness was so intense that I began to black out. I was unconscious for about 1-2min, then came to but my vision was still unclear. I was taken via wheelchair to the paramedics on the opposite end of the gymnasium, and at this point I was heavily perspiring and very pale but still coherent. I felt my vision and dizziness significantly improve after being able to lay down. I was transported to the hospital for observation but had much improved by the time I arrived. An EKG, bloodwork, and cardiac tests were recommended to discern possible underlying heart related conditions, but I declined because I already had a PAT for thyroid surgery scheduled the next day that would be running those same tests. This reaction was likely due to not having eaten  for several hours prior to the vaccine. After about an hour I felt well enough to drive myself back home and dealt with mild aches and pains that evening, chills, and a low grade fever all of which resolved themselves by the next morning.

                                                I woke up noticing a slight headache, but I figured it was from poor sleep the night prior. I noticed after breakfast that I felt really cold and felt an internal shiver, especially in my chest. My fingers and toes were ice cold even with a sweater, blanket, and a warm tea. I noticed my skin starting to feel tender and I felt very fatigued. I wanted knew I needed to eat so that I could take ibuprofen, but I experienced a loss of appetite. I had a mild cough, but I felt too tired to even cough. I rocked in a chair in the sunlight outside for about 15 minutes and still felt cold. When I took my oral temperature after coming inside, I was reading 99.9. I took 400mg of Ibuprofen by 1130 and layed down to rest. Bundled in 3 layers, I felt the shivering couldn&#39;t stop. My headache got worse and my skin was tender to the touch. I was able to sleep for approximately 3 hours and I woke up drenched in sweat. I took my oral temperature again and was at 101.1. I drank some more water and tried to sleep some more. When I woke up around 4:30 pm, I felt a lot better. My temperature went down to 97.8 and I had a boost in energy and appetite. I no longer had a headache and I had only mild muscle aches. By the next morning, I felt completely normal again.

I started getting really cold, took my temperature and it was at 100.1. Got a headache, slightly nauseous, body aches got a lot worse (particularly my lower back). I was also feeling a little dizzy and having a hard time comprehending information; this was probably the fever. Around 8pm,  I took my temperature again and it had risen to 102. I took some extra strength Tylenol which started helping about 30 minutes later. I woke up 3/12/2021 still with some body aches, slight headache, and slight stomachache.

She began to feel faint and an employee of our facility caught her as she experienced a near syncopal episode. She was promptly placed in Trendelenburg position and vitals obtained. BP was 90/58 with mild tachycardia to max of 130-140 bpm. Patient was given supportive treatment and monitored. BP improved to 110/70 after 5 minutes and 120/72 after 15 minutes. Patient continued to feel very dizzy and weak, however, and became tachycardic and diaphoretic each time she attempted to move to a seated position. After 1 hour of monitoring and vitals showing continued tachycardia, decision was made to transport the patient to ER for further testing. Patient expressed agreement and understanding of plan to transport to ER via ambulance.

                                                Approximately 7 hours after receiving the single dose of the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine,  symptoms such as muscle aches, fatigue, and fever set in. Symptoms rapidly worsened over the next few hours, with the fever reaching a max temp of 103 degrees Fahrenheit. This required monitoring and the use of ice packs to keep the fever under control. Muscle aches were severe, and were particularly prominent in the lower back region and the injection site. Fever remained in the 100-103 degree range for the duration of the night and by the next day, temperature returned to around 98 degrees.

                                                The injection itself was quite painful (and I&#39;ve had many vaccine shots in my life). Felt completely fine until around 4pm when I felt a dull headache. Around 5pm, my head was throbbing so much that I couldn&#39;t leave my bed. Around 6pm, I felt muscle pains starting around my neck, slowly moving to my shoulders, chest, and upper back. Without taking any medication, I slept and woke up around 8pm. I was sweating, felt so cold but hot at the same time. The muscle pains were intense, and my head hurt so much that I took a single capsule of 200mg Advil. The pain became more manageable around 30 minutes later. Was still sweating, and muscle aches continued. I slept again at around 2am (May 26, 2021) and woke up at 10am. Head was no longer hurting, but muscle aches were still lingering. Currently, 1:04pm on March 26, 2021, I feel weak and tired with muscles pains around my upper body, but overall feeling much better than yesterday.

                                                I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine at 8:30AM on Friday, March 26. The only symptoms I experienced until that evening were mild soreness at the injection site, mild stiffness/soreness in my left arm and my neck, and mild body aches. At 6:00PM that day, I was driving and experienced sudden-onset nausea and dizziness. I experienced tunnel vision and my vision began to black out. I was able to pull off the road and began retching and dry heaving. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my lips and then in my right hand, each of which lasted for about a minute. The nausea lasted for 5-10 minutes, after which it dissipated and I started experiencing chills. After returning home, around 9:30PM I experienced a severe headache and a return of sudden-onset nausea. I also experienced tingling/numbness in my right hand again, which disappeared after about 5 minutes. I retched and dry heaved again, and I took two Advil. The nausea passed and I was able to go back to sleep. The next morning, the nausea had completely disappeared,  and the only lingering symptoms were a mild headache and mild stiffness/body aches.

                                                ?Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine?  Approximately 5 hours after recieving the vaccine I started feeling extremely tired and cold despite the climate being warmer than usual. I went to sleep and woke up shivering, i was cold but my body was burning to the touch. My body ached and I had a headache and nausea. My eyes hurt whenever I moved them. These symptoms persisted until 9:18, I took 2 tylenol pills and started feeling better. Today is my third day, my eye pain has not gone and I still feel tired but what is bothering the most is the eye pain whenever I look anywhere or move my head.

The entire night was spent tossing and turning, drenched in sweat while simultaneously feeling like I was on fire. On top of this I had a massive headache. Today is the day after and my fever has gone down throughout the day, but it is pretty bad. I still have a headache and also vomited a few times today. I have been taking acetaminophen and took some pepto bismol. I was able to start eating later in the day.

After providing the same immunization to her spouse she lost color in her face, began sweating, and became faint. She did not lose consciousness but was drowsy, diaphoretic, pale and stated she lost hearing for a couple minutes. I kept her awake and asked her questions to assess for alertness. She was aware of date, location, name, year. She was not improving after 5 minutes so paramedics were called to evaluate her. She was cared for by the paramedic team and recovered after 40 minutes. She was diagnosed with vasovagal syncope due to the vaccine. She refused transport to the ER and left of her own accord.

My muscles all felt painful and sore, had a painful headache, felt very disoriented and woozy. It was a struggle to walk or move, and couldn&#39;t talk loud or for a long time at once. Had to go home from work and spent the rest of the day sleeping. Around 4pm, 24 hours after the injection, my muscles felt less sore and was feeling better. The next morning, I was back to being completely normal.

                                                I am a 25 year old female with no underlying/otherwise known health conditions. I received the vaccine Saturday, March 27th at ~1:30pm. No initial side effects, barely any arm pain, and I felt completely normal and fine for about 8 hours post vaccination. After ~8 hours, I began to develop body aches and tiredness, and within an hour of this onset I got severe chills. A few hours later (this is the middle of the night going into Sunday March 28th) I developed a fever that lasted into the next day. I was not able to take my temperature in the middle of the night but the next morning it had come down to 99.6F (still a slight fever). I had fatigue and tiredness the entire next day. I did not take any medication/fever reducer.  To sum up, I had no side effects upon initially receiving the vaccine, side effects set in ~8 hours post-vaccination and overall lasted about 24 hours. I have had no additional side effects other than those reported and have felt well since those subsided.

I felt foggy and &#34;off&#34; at this time, like my head isn&#39;t clear. There has also been constant aching at the site of injection in my left arm.

At the top of the stairs I passed out and fell backwards. Not sure exactly how long I was out, but no more than a few minutes. When I woke up I was disoriented and nauseous but didn&#39;t have the strength to get up. I rolled into my side and vomited 3 times. My fiance helped me get up slowly. He took my temp but I did NOT have a fever. The nausea, dizziness, and lightheadedness subsided after about 10 minutes, so I decided to NOT seek medical attention. This morning I have a headache and body aches in my lower back and left arm.
