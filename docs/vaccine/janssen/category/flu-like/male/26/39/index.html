Got more blankets and tried to get some sleep, but took a while due to the migraine.

Stayed in bed until about 1:45pm Saturday. By then, the migraine was manageable and nausea was not as bad, though still had a temperature of 99.9 F. Took a shower and took 2 pills of  ibuprofen.

                                                Went most of the day with no symptoms. Performed a High Intensity Workout around 7pm for an hour, and ate shortly after. Took a hot shower and relaxed before bed time around 10pm started to have a headache. By 10:45 when I went to sleep it was an intense headache. Under the covers my body was incredibly hot, without covers I was freezing cold. I woke up around midnight in a sweat and again around 2:30am when I called in sick to work. I then sat in my bathroom for 30 minutes, threw up once, and then feeling much better (Still had an intense headache) I drank some water and fell back asleep in my room. Today is the second day, I have a small headache, have not eaten all day, and slept most of the afternoon. I highly recommend not working out the same day of getting the vaccine, I didn&#39;t think to ask about that when I received it. I doubt I would have had this problem if I rested instead.

Hearing came back after 5 minutes, but moderate body shakes began and lasted an hour. Got very cold feeling and began to feel fever like. Took acetaminophen and covered up with blankets and drank water. Took a couple hour nap and woke up sweating with terrible migraine and light body shakes. Fell asleep for a few more hours and woke up not feeling feverish, but migraine and body aches. 22 hours after onset I have a light headache and body aches and am mostly feeling recovered.

When I laid down I became very flush and sweaty.  Then at 12am experienced fever of 101, body aches, and sharp stabbing chest pain which has lasted 18 hours so far.

                                                Initial symptoms of visual impairment, later diagnosed as visual snow, occurred on Sunday 3/28 along with a headache. Assumed it was a migraine, but after it continued on Monday 3/29 I called advise nurse and scheduled exams for my eyes. The eye doctor confirmed it seems to be experiencing symptoms of visual snow. My vision is currently still looks like static. It has not gone away.  Google search showed potential side effect of astrazeca vaccine in their report so am assuming it is also a side effect of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine as this occurred as a result of receiving it.  I never had this before.

After awaking he doesn&#39;t remember the last 5 minutes. He laid down to go to sleep and was consistently hot and then cold. He does have a history of night terrors but they have remained dormant for about 2.5 years. Around 12 am he started having one of the worst night terrors I&#39;ve seen. The following morning, April 2nd 2021, he was feeling incredibly sore and the injection spot was tender. He said &#34;it feels like I got hit by a truck.&#34; Seems to be doing okay otherwise now.

                                                Patient came in for vaccine. After vaccination, I had patient sit in a chair in case of any adverse reactions. About 5 minutes after vaccination, another patient came over and said that was not feeling well. When going out to patient I noticed he was very pale and sweating.  The patient then proceeded to pass out. I was able to hold the patients head and the other customer was able to hold his shoulders to make sure he did not fall out of the chair. The patient then got very stiff and proceeded to push back in his chair, after about 10 seconds he relaxed. The patient was passed out for about 3 mins, during that time I was able to remove his mask and hold his head. After gaining consciousness, I was able to make sure he was ok. We were able to give him some water and he stated he felt better. I asked the patient to stay for another half hour to monitor. After giving the patient another bottle of water, and having him sit he was able to get up and leave.

I went back and checked on him after 5mins of waiting, then came back to the pharmacy. But heard a big bang shortly after. Some how, he had fallen out of his chair and bumped his head and neck on an end camp. He seemed a little confused, when I ran over, but was awake, a little sweaty and nauseated. EMS was called. They transported him to ER to have his head checked, since he bumped it.

Got up to use the bathroom around 5am. Upon finishing peeing while standing, I lost consciousness, falling. As a result of the fall, I fractured my cheek bone, cut open my ear, later requiring three stitches, and was concussed, resulting in a loss of memory. I was nonresponsive when my fiance found me immediately following the crash, and was rushed to the hospital  via ambulance. Upon arrival to the hospital, my fever was found to be 102 F. As a result of the fall, I have a cheek bone fracture, three stiches in my ear, and a concussion.

After reaching my home even after few hours also I didnt have any symptoms. But before I went to sleep (around 12:30 am ), i started to have mild pain near the vaccination sight. Even during my sleep i felt okay, but as soon as I woke up (around 09:00 am) i felt mild symptoms on pain, as I started attending to my regular activties right after 10:00 am, i started to feel severe chills, fever,  body pains, lazyness, moderate headache and severe pain at vaccination site. Again I had some food and slept due to severe body pains and even through the sleep also I had severe body pains, fever, nausea and lazyness. As I woke up after my evening nap of 3 hours, i woke up at 6:00 pm and felt chills, body pains., fever and nausea.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I received the Janssen vaccine in my upper-left arm at 3:00 PM on April 5, 2021, at a public health clinic (I think that&#39;s the proper term for the site) established in a mall. After about ten minutes, during the scheduled waiting period, I began to feel lightheaded; I can best compare the feeling to that of being tipsy after a glass or two of wine. I waited another twenty minutes at the site to see if the feeling worsened, and when it didn&#39;t, I left without telling anyone how I felt. During the drive home, however, I continued to feel lightheaded during the drive home and worried that it might be affecting my driving. After I got home without incident, the feeling persisted for a few hours and ceased that evening.  Since then, I have experienced nothing but what I think are standard post-vaccination symptoms (fatigue, muscle aches, slight brain fog, swollen lymph nodes?not unlike the sensations of recovering from a modest cold). I nevertheless want to report the lightheadedness because it appears (based on news reports) that it is an unusual reaction to the vaccine. I want to make sure that my experience is recorded, even though I do not believe that I require further medical attention.

Throughout the entirety of the next day nausea, headache, and weakness persisted. After 36 hours, mostly bedridden, and 12 hours of sleep the following night symptoms have dissipated as of 10 AM 4/10/21.

                                                The patient was nervous prior to vaccine and had a needle phobia. About 5 minutes post-vaccine, the patient stated he was not feeling well and feeling warm and sweaty. The pharmacy staff provided the patient with water and an ice pack. The patient stated he was feeling faint. The patient fainted for about 20 seconds and then became conscious again. The patient didn&#39;t have any injuries and didn&#39;t fall down. The patient was okay and he laid down and elevated his feet on a chair. He then stated that he has severe needle phobia and has fainted several times in the past with vaccine administration and blood draws. He had experienced this in the past. He was still slightly faint and requested that he be checked out. The EMT arrived and they took his vitals and checked him. By the time the EMT arrived, he was beginning to feel better and had sat up and drinking water. There were no further issues. The EMT stated he was good to head home. We followed up with patient and the patient was feeling good with no further issues.

                                                I received the J&amp;J vaccine at 10:00am on March 18, 2021 at the Community Center. By about 5:00pm, I started to feel minor flu-like symptoms, but as the night progressed it got significantly worse. Around 8-9pm, I was bedridden with the worst chills/shaking I&#39;ve ever experienced in my life. Around 9:30-10:00pm, I was filling water at my sink and projectile vomitted multiple times into the sink and could not make it to the bathroom. Subsequently, I ate a bagel and drank lots of water, knowing my vomitting could make me dehydrated. Throughout the night, I was awake and shaking, and drank and filled my water bottle repeatedly. At 8:00am, I was filling my water, and without my knowledge of awareness, fainted on my kitchen floor, dropping the Brita filter and likely hitting my head. My roommate heard the commotion and saw me passed out in our kitchen. He tried to wake me up and I phased in, but then subsequently phased out again 20-30 seconds later as I was trying to stand and likely hit my head again. My roommate eventually got me over to our couch and called EMTs. Upon their arrival, EMTs checked my pulse, which was fine, and saw an open laceration on the back of my head, so they took me to Hospital to access the Trauma Center. On the way, I threw up repeatedly and was very lightheaded. Upon my arrival at Hospital, I was checked for any neck bone breaks, given an IV, a CT  scan, an EKG, and staples were placed in the back of my head to heal the laceration. After my release, I was bedridden for 2-3 days and required a daily nap during work (1-2) hours for the next 1 1/2 to 2 weeks. For a while, everything was fine, but recently during the first two weeks of April, it has become apparent that my head is foggy and reacts to changes in the weather, which leads me to believe that I likely banged my head pretty good when I fainted those two times.

                                                Initial adverse reaction was a headache and impaired vision. My vision has continued to be impaired with it being similar to static and has caused headaches.   After research I saw AstraZeneca had this in their files as a possible side effect. I understand it is different but made with similar technology so it may or may not be true for J&amp;J vaccine, but this has continued for almost a month so I am concerned.

Then he felt like he fell asleep until the person checking him called at him.  He had some vision and hearing impairment at the beginning, then after 10 minutes he was better. His arm was hot, he was sweating, his skin was turning white color.  His mom came (she was shopping) and said the patient is usually an anxious person, so it was overwhelming to be at department store and getting the shot.  After another 10 minutes, he was drinking water, his senses were back, he was fine.

                                                I woke up in the middle of the night experiencing severe chills and shaking, my body was cold to the touch and I was unable to get warm. This lasted for several hours until finally fading away at around 12:30-1:00 PM on the same day (May 20th, 2021), at which point I developed a mild fever. I was unable to find any report of this side effect of severe chills/shaking on the vaccine&#39;s pamphlet that I got.

While driving home after leaving the pharmacy, I started experiencing light headed ness and dizziness.  This eventually turned into tunnel vision which I thought was going to result in me fainting.  This led me to start pulling over, but then the tunnel vision went away.  During my short 10 minute drive home, this happened to me twice.  After getting home, I had about 3 similar episodes during which similar light headedness happened.  These all felt like they were getting close to fainting, and at one point while walking up the stairs in my house I could not stand.  All of these symptoms started approximately 20 minutes after leaving the store, and then took place in a 20-30 minute timespan. Roughly 4-5 episodes in total, including the drive home and short time spent at home.  No issues after lightheadedness stopped, besides feeling tired.    I do not have a history of anxiety attacks due to needles.  Donated blood and plasma in college, and have recieved many vaccines and never had this happen.

The second day I had blurry vision and all those symptoms so I went to doctor. They said I was having a reaction and also gave me Toradol for the back pain. I started to feel better symptom wise  but the following day I started to poop blood. That only happened for one day then went away after a day. But I?ve had one or two more bloody stools since then. The ER said that it?s likely from the Toradol but to keep an eye on it. I have had 2 episodes since but it?s been random. Haven?t taken any more ibuprofen at all, was told to take omeprazole for a month and see how my body recovers

I then went to sleep and woke up with a throbbing migraine and my legs were so sore I wanted to cut them off.  I could barely walk they were so tight.  I have now been getting bruising on my legs.  I don&#39;t know if it is due to the shot though.  I shaved my legs and I usually get some bruising after that.  My arms have been slightly tense and sore as well.  I have reasons outside of the shot to believe that it may not be the vaccine, but I thought I should report it.

Decided to sweat it out. Would get very light headed upon standing and was continuously nauseous. Woke my mom up at around 4am after fighting the illness all night and she made me tea to rehydrate and eventually I was able to keep down advil and the headache subsided. Felt ALOT like the side effects I had after getting a lumbar puncture.

Within 3 days I developed chronic stomach pain and GI problems.  Bloody stool has been going on now for 3 months.  I weigh 145 lbs and have lost 40 lbs. currently at 105 lbs.  Doctors haven&#39;t been able to diagnose my situation even after several blood tests, colonoscopies and biopsy&#39;s.  I was a perfectly healthy 26 year old with no family issues of GI problems or other complications.  I now can barely stand for a few minutes at a time.  Doctors think I have either Chrons, or Ulcerative Colitis, but the biopsy&#39;s are inconclusive.

                                                Woke up at 12:00am today with headache, lots of discomfort (especially in stomach), and for the most part could only fall back asleep for short intervals while being awake most of the night.   At around 2:30am, could barely walk into the front room. Just very slowly and painfully. Ended up in such a state that I absentmindedly urinated onnthe bathroom floor while pulling pant leg up to scratch an itch while urinating in toilet. Laying on back caused butt and thighs to hurt significantly more. Same for stomach. Getting up from and laying down on my floor mattress was and still is difficult.   Later into the morning at around 6:40am, had to crawl slowly on hands and knees to get back in the front room. By around 8am, I could walk around without it being unbearable. Just slow-ish. Ate breakfast, so stomach is more uncomfortable than in pain. Can lay on it without too much problem, but butt is still hurting. Stretching legs forward caused some pain.  Possible fever.

Fell back asleep and woke up with a horrible headache and migraine (primarily behind my eyes). Entire body ached and had a fever of 100.5. This lasted the entire next day after receiving the vaccine. The second day, the headache subsided but my neck and lymph nodes were swollen and very sore.

Then later in the evening it happened again but this time it was hard to breathe because everything in my body was so tight. This lasted until I got into the shower with the temperature set as hot as I could.

From this point on however, I experienced a substantial headache, coming and going all morning. Until now (12:45 PM) when I still feel a slight headache.

About 5-10 min later my heart rate became very fast very quickly and it became more difficult to breathe. I was driving home at the time, had to pull over and wait a few minutes until the event subsided. I debated contacting medical help, but i began recovering and was able to continue driving. Since the event i have been feeling slightly fatigued and i have a slight feverish feeling, but in general have been able to rest and have not had a repeat occurrence. I received no medical attention or treatment.

                                                6-7 hours after receiving, I got a headache, and became very tired &amp; achey all over. I took ibuprofen &amp; acetaminophen and felt reasonably better for a few hours. Then later that night (12-18 hours after vaccine) I became much sicker and was unable to sleep. I had a low fever, upset stomach, severe chills (couldn&#39;t stop shaking/shivering for over an hour) body aches, and an extremely bad headache. I continued to use ibuprofen and acetaminophen but even combined they weren&#39;t nearly enough to relieve my symptoms. Late into the night around 3-4am (15-16 hours after vaccine) nausea became the worst side effect, surpassing the headache. I eventually vomited around 4am, after which point the symptoms became more bearable and I managed to sleep a couple hours. Thursday/Friday (two days after vaccine) I still felt very weak, achey, and tired and had to call out of work both days. I was never again in the severe discomfort I experienced Wednesday night/Thursday morning, but I still felt a little tired, achey, and mildly sour stomach on days 3 &amp;4 (Saturday/Sunday). Monday morning I felt similarly tired &amp; achey, but I do feel essentially back to normal Monday night.

                                                Around 6 pm the same day I received the J&amp;J shot I started to feel chilly and a little nausea. I went for a walk for about 40 mins started to feel worse. I had body aches throughout my back and chest and in both arms, was freezing. Tried to eat dinner but couldn?t, too much pain and increased nausea. Tried to lay down, but began having a fast heartbeat and fast/some difficulty breathing. The pain in my chest was the worst pain I?ve ever felt. Continued feeling horrible with a fever of 100.7, nausea, headache pains throughout chest back and arms, freezing, and my arms and legs felt like they were becoming numb. Could not stand, very dizzy, tried to sleep through it. I threw up around 11 and did so a couple more times after that. Was finally able to sleep and woke up feeling much better. Arm is still sore at the injection point.

                                                I gave the vaccine around 6:20pm after counseling on possible adverse reactions and going over the patient&#39;s questions. I then asked them to wait 15min. Within 5-10mins the patient got up and came back to our counter saying he thinks he&#39;s having a reaction. I pulled him back into our vaccination area and had him sit down and explain what he was feeling to me. He looked pale and told me he felt dizzy, sweaty, shaky, &amp; nauseous. He wanted me to grab him a bag incase he puked. I grabbed a bag as well as water and Benadryl. I asked if he was having any issues breathing or if it felt like his tongue was swollen at all. He said no issues breathing and tongue felt fine.  He started to feel better within about 10-15 minutes after onset. He did not puke and his color returned. I had him wait an additional 10-15 minutes after that to make sure we were recovered. I asked him if there was anything else going on and he mentioned that he hadn&#39;t slept well the night before and that he had barely eaten today. He also mentioned he can get anxiety. I told him all of those factors could certainly contribute to what he just experienced but that I would be reporting this on to be safe.

                                                Approximately eight hours after injection, sweeping to severe fatigue began to onset along with severe headache and moderate to severe chills, along with other &#34;flu-like&#34; symptoms, including symptoms of fever but no recorded fever.  Lasted through the night and hindered sleep without the help of OTC sleep medication.  After 8 hours of overnight sleep, woke up next day feeling better, but still had a terrible headache and a great deal of fatigue.  Considered visiting a walk-in clinic or the ER at least four times throughout this timeframe.  Symptoms lessened with time with a bad headache and lingering fatigue being the most consistent 24 to 36 hours after the initial injection time.  Now May 3 at 1:00pm, several days after, most symptoms have subsided except for some lingering fatigue which still is present.

On April 16th I still had the headaches and leg pain , but also while driving I began loosing my vision and started to pass out/faint. I Pulled over and waited at least a half hour. during that time I. noticed I couldn&#39;t type or read anything on my phone as I was trying to reach a friend to help me. eventually after time had passed I was able to drive myself to a friends where I thought the best thing would be to sleep it off. the headaches and leg pain lasted a couple more days and I thought it was going to go away, but it is now May 5th and today and last couple days the leg pain feels more like someone has been punching my left leg. five had chest pain and headaches return. I do not have medical insurance and have avoided going to the hospital or primary care because I am afraid. today the pain is so irritating and sore I wish I could escape my body.

I sat him down immediately, he was having trouble staying awake eyes glossing over, speech very slow. I turned to push the door open into the main pharmacy to call for help and have them dial 911, grabbed epinephrine and ammonia salts as well. When I turned back he had slumped in his chair. As I took the step back towards him, he spontaneously started to sit up and speak. Was diaphoretic, still slow speech eyes glossy. I supported him as best I could. His HR was 42, i lifted his legs up unto to a chair in quazi trandelenburg position. He stated that made him feel alot better. I stayed with him until EMTS arrived. He got himself onto they stretcher and they took him out of the store.

Upon walking away, he gets light-headed and starts to fall.  He half catches himself on immunization booth nearby. He sits in chair in booth. I check on him. He says he is ok. He is a little pale and sweating a little. A few minutes later he says he is fine and wants to leave. he agrees to stay longer. A little later after other store team members have checked on him, I check on him again. He says he is fine and then leaves.

By the time I went to bed,  my body was extremely sensitive. Entering my bed was painful due to the cold sheets, the cold was contrasted by the occasional heat flash. The night was full of body aches, hot and cold flashes, and loads of sweating. I woke up with a headache and body soreness. That was the worst of it. Spent the remainder of the day resting in bed.  Notes: I rarely get sick, maybe like this once every few years. I probably could have drank more water to flush out my system following the shot.

He then slumped to side and head hit side of wall since we had chair with side rails positioned against wall. He lost conscious for maybe 30 seconds and then eyes opened. I asked if he was OK and the first thing he asked for was water. He said he felt light headed and dizzy. I had my intern who was working grab him water from the deli and had him sit and rest. He started sweating and asked for paper towels. I grabbed him a couple of towels so he can wipe his face. I continued to check on him while doing my work. He seemed fine after that. After 30 minutes, I checked his blood pressure. It read 100/63.  I continued to monitor him and he left after that. He did have friend with him the entire time who helped him.

No fear of needles. I have records of getting previous flu vaccines without passing out.  I have been experiencing hot flashes, nausea and fatigue for 6 days now.

                                                After like two weeks, before going to bed, I started having SOB and then a full-on chaotic panic attack. Chest pain, stomach was visually twisted and hurt, felt like I had a knot in my throat and full on anxiety. It took about a week for it to start going away after one Urgent Care visit, two ER visits, and a PC visit who prescribed me with clonazepan and Prozac. When I took both of them two weeks later, my symptoms and pain finally got better, but I am still having SOB, a little fatigue, my joints hurt once in a while, digestive problems, weird chest feeling. At least the heart pains went away.

I talked with him and he said he was dizzy as well. He stated that it is due to anxiety. I checked his blood pressure and it was 124/94 with a pulse of 83. We gave him a cold pack to use on his wrists and neck. We watched the patient for any worsening of symptoms. After a while the patient stated he now felt  fine with no symptoms and left with no issues.

Technician called paramedics, store manager was called and when I asked him his name and if he knew where he was he said yes. We sat him up per his request. When he was well enough we sat him on a chair, I took his blood pressure and we got him water. He was on the phone with his dad who is a physician and dad said it sounded like a syncope and asked we give him gator aid. Paramedics arrived and they took his vitals and ran some tests.

Lymphnodes have been in pain and swollen since the first or second day after the shot. Headaches on and off for a month now. And my anxiety has been like I&#39;m in fight or flight mode all of my waking moments. Even when I&#39;m falling asleep. I will wake up with panic attacks. My muscles can&#39;t take talking on the phone for longer than 5 minutes before I have to switch to my other arm because the previous arm is &#34;dead&#34; in the muscles and couldn&#39;t do it any longer. Blood pressure was in the 180-190&#39;s / the high 80&#39;s and sometimes even 90 being my bottom BP number. It has since gone down because of meditation.

I was woken up at 10:30 pm feeling disoriented and hot, with a fever of 104.5 degrees F. My wife noticed slurring of words and that I seemed unstable and confused, and symptoms were severe enough we considered going to the emergency room.  I experienced ringing in my ears and a severe headache.  I took 2 extra strength Tylenol, put a cold cloth on forehead, and drank fluids to fall back asleep.  Fever dropped to around 102 but continued throughout the night.  I woke up at 6:30 am and took two more Tylenol.  The severe headache continued and I vomited twice.  I attempted to take a shower and rinse off, and continue to rest.  Fever is reduced to 99 degrees F with help of Tylenol.

                                                Broke into cold sweats when I went to the bathroom. Went back and sat in the chair and blacked out. Eyes rolled into the back of my head. Stiffened up and rolled out of the chair. Then I slowly came out of the black out.

                                                At 10 pm I started to experience some moderate body aches. By 1 am, I was in so much pain I could not sleep and started to develop a fever. I drank a ton of fluids, used OTC treatments (Ibuprofen and Motrin) but nothing alleviated the pain. By 10 am I had a sustained fever over 100 degrees. I was in so much pain I was crying in bed. By 3 pm my fever reached 102 degrees. I had to go to the emergency room for IV drip and medication because I couldn&#39;t drink enough water to stay hydrated. Once given IV, my temperature plummeted. When the medication they administered wore off, my body started experiencing mild to moderate pains again. Body aches and soreness all over- my muscles feel like they are being squeezed from the inside. I am still feeling a lot of fatigue and pain but it is random and comes and goes along with &#34;hot flashes&#34;.

Once I was alert, I felt nauseas and was heading to the restroom when I passed out again and was unconscious. I do not remember the episodes. There were no signs of passing out before I did either time.

At 6:35, he said he had left arm weakness (arm he received vaccine in), fatigue, was dizzy, and felt &#34;off&#34;.  Patient did not lose consciousness and refused an ice pack.  BP checked at 6:38pm (170/98, pulse 105).  Patient stated his blood pressure usually runs high. I offered him an ice pack a second time, but he said there was no need and he felt better.  BP checked again 6:52pm (152/101, pulse 99).  I recommended that since his blood pressure is usually this high, he should follow up with his primary doctor regarding blood pressure as he may need some medication to assist in lowering it.  He said ok.  He left the pharmacy area at 7:02pm and said he was fine to leave, he did not want to remain any longer.

                                                The patient had symptoms of light-headedness, diaphoresis, and was pale approximately 8 minutes after administration.  No signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis were identified so the patient was observed and monitored.  The patient then became unconscious for approximately 10-15 seconds with small jerking movements identified during this time. 911 was called and the patient was monitored until EMS arrived.  Epinephrine was prepared and ready during this whole time but was not administered because the patient didn&#39;t show symptoms of anaphylaxis (trouble breathing or talking, trouble swallowing, hives, flushing etc).  The  time from vaccine administration to EMS arrival was approximately 20-25 minutes.   The patient was able to talk and communicate clearly the entire time except during the brief unconscious period.

I was monitoring his temperature and he did not have a fever. I was massaging his hands and legs, this went on for 45 minutes to 1 hour. When the shaking subsided, the fever started, at this point I gave him Tylenol and continued to monitor his temperature.  He is better this morning.

Did not have an allergic reaction. Did not need to call 9-1-1. Just worked himself up so much about it. Sent him home as I didn&#39;t want him to complete his shift while vomiting. Was having chills and wasn&#39;t sure how long they were going to last. Left him to go home with girlfriend. Went out front to wait for his ride and get some fresh air. Exchanged numbers so I could keep in contact with him. Knows to contact EMS if symptoms worsen.

After a few minutes of not scratching the crooks of my arms, I had noticed that both crooks of my arms were still red. I then took off my shirt and realized that I had an extensive rash with hives all over my trunk. I also had a sudden onset of nasal congestion and sneezing during this same time period. I took Benadryl and Pepsid on that same night and then saw my primary care doctor the following morning. My primary care doctor diagnosed my rash/hives as a probable result. I was instructed to continue with the Benadryl and Pepsid and watch for any changes.

Then felt throat tingling and tightness on his drive home.  Came back to the pharmacy, drank some water, we opted to give him loratadine instead of benadryl since he had a 2&#43; hour back home.  He stayed in the pharmacy for another hour and was able to drink water and eat a snack with no issues and wanted to continue on his trek home. He called us when he arrived home and was feeling fine.

Helped to lie down on matt, with feet in chair, and cool cloth applied to neck. Blood pressure was 100/64 and pulse was 64. After about 2 minutes, he said he felt better than when he first came in. I asked him if he had ever had this happen before and he said yes when he had blood drawn a few years ago. He was helped to sit up in a chair. He no longer had any light-headedness and his color was returning to normal. His lips were now pink. He was given a granola bar and water to drink. After staying for 20 minutes longer he left. He was called the next day by me and he said he had not had any light-headedness after he left.

He then wasa responsive but sweating profusely.  We got him to the floor andput cold compresses on forehead and neck and waited for 911 to arrive.  They released him to his girlfriend to bring him home.

                                                One week after receiving the vaccine I woke up on 5/21 with a mild rash. As the day went on the rash progressed and swelling of lips and uvula occurred around 5pm. I was taken to an urgent care who transferred me to a hospital via rescue. I spent the night at the hospital receiving multiple epi pen injections, and fluids. I was discharged 5/22 with a dose of prednisone. I was fatigued all day. On 5/23 I woke up to swollen eyes and lips and covered in hives again. I went to the ER where I was given steroids and fluids again. The hives went down but did not go away.  One 5/24 I took multiple doses of Benadryl and dose of prednisone and in the evening time the hives progressed. Today 5/25 I woke up with swollen lips and checks and hives. I went to my doctors office to be evaluated.

                                                5 minutes after initial injection I became increasingly lightheaded, nauseous, dizzy, disoriented, and fatigued. 10 minutes after initial injection I experienced a short fainting event in passenger seat of vehicle. Immediately after regaining composure I began sweating profusely and became very pale/flushed color in face at which point I exited the vehicle and flagged EMS to assist me. EMS monitored blood pressure and blood saturation before releasing me on my own recognizance approximately 25 minutes later. Tingling sensation felt in left arm after fainting approximately 10 minuets after initial injection. Next 48 hours after injection I experienced severe body chills, body aches, headache, nausea, loss of appetite, and night sweats. 72 hours after injection I am close to fully recovered but still experience fatigue and night sweats.

Enough to fall asleep for a couple hours.   2 hours after I got the shot I started feeling effects. I didn?t sleep until 0400 in the morning because I was in so much pain. Today I have a headache and my body is sore but I feel a lot better.  If I didn?t live so far away from my friends or coworkers I would have gone to the hospital. I was too weak and sick to use my phone.

The patient was assessed and given water and a snack. He informed the pharmacist on duty that his neck and head were a little sore from the fall but that he was feeling better.. After speaking to EMS he stayed for about 20 minutes then left.

                                                Pretty quickly after the shot (that evening) I felt a tingling/prickling in my finger tips and I swore down in my toes. I developed a few sickness symptoms the next day but definitely felt much better about 48 hours later.   What I really want to say now is that I still feel like I notice very minor tingling in my fingers (mainly left arm) but sometimes down in legs or right forearm. Additionally, my upper left arm where the injection was sometimes feels stiff or strange. It isn&#39;t pain, but its more like a nuisance.

                                                vasovagal syncope or seizure? After receiving the drive-through vaccine, we drove into a parking space to sit and make sure I was ok. Within 5-10 minutes, I was sitting in the car and sending a text and with no warning whatsoever mid-text lost consciousness, profuse sweating, wheezing, lost color in my skin, was making unintelligible noises, and eventually woke up about a minute later but couldn&#39;t speak or comprehend those speaking to me (according to my wife who was terrified).  I was not nervous, stressed, or scared of receiving a vaccine. I regained the ability to speak about a minute later and my wife had summoned the staff on the scene who instructed me to lie back and breathe without a mask. I drank some liquids. A nurse was called over and offered to take my vital signs but I decided I felt ok enough not to. Eventually my normal skin color and came back and sweating stopped after about 5 minutes. We sat for a few extra minutes and once I felt it was past me,  my wife drove us home.

                                                At 6:00 PM 3/12 I began to feel slightly dizzy. It did not effect my ability to stand or move around very much, but my head did feel strange and if I turned to quickly I would need a second to gather myself. However, it was not severe enough to force me to sit or lay down. By 7:00-7:30 I began to feel hot and uncomfortable and I took my temperature at 7:30 and I was running a low grade fever at 99.8 degrees F. I began to feel very fatigued and was in bed by 9:00 PM. I woke up feeling fine and my temperature at 7:00 AM 3/13 is 97.8 degrees F. My only possible side effect this morning (3/12 as I write this) is that I am mildly stiff, mostly in my left arm, neck, and back (the side of the injection site). Despite the mild fever I did not feel any nausea, nor did I have difficulty breathing. Overall the side effects were mild but uncomfortable.

The fourth and fifth day my lips and face would become tingly/numb and my left arm would get weak and I would feel a little disoriented, my sleep has been pretty disturbed. It felt like I was having a stroke. I did not have a stroke,  I continue to occasionally feel the above symptoms, a little less potent than they were, they might be going away, I can&#39;t tell. I will be calling my doctor if it continues.

Slept until 11:15pm and woke up to violent shivering, pounding headache, full body aches, sore skin, achey joints, nausea, swelling tongue and throat. Took 1 dose of nyquil and then tossed and turned all night, very little sleep, symptoms persisted into the next day, but shivering stopped in the night. By morning (3-14) registered a fever of 100.3 which persisted most of the day along with remaining lessening symptoms. By evening I was still very sore, bad headache, and very lethargic/fatigued. Next morning (3-15) low temp of 97.1 degrees, headache, fatigue, lightheaded. Still feel headachy and tired.

I took tylonel during this time. I also experienced diarrhea and loss of appetite during the day; random periods of feeling nauseous. I seemed to be dehydrated but drank a normal amount of water the day before. It felt like I had the flu, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve felt this sick since I was a kid. It was terrible. I felt incredibly tired on Tuesday but couldn&#39;t fall asleep. 3/17--woke up today feeling mostly fine minus a bit of lingering soreness and feeling very tired still.

Then the fever decreased to about 100.5 for the next 24 hours.  After my fever broke, however, I developed a chest cough with some phlegm. This feels like bronchitis and my doctor has prescribed azithromycin. I also feel rolling fatigue, which comes on randomly. The cough and fatigue has persisted so far for 6 days. In addition, though I do not have a fever most of the day, on some nights my fever spikes (last night, reaching 102 for a short period of time while trying to sleep). It has been 8 days since my injection. I have very little appetite (though I can smell and taste fine).

                                                I had extreme chest pain on the 24th of March. It really hurt to breathe and it felt like I had pressure on my chest. I went to the Emergency room and they did a chest x-ray and a Covid-19 both of which were negative. I went home and I returned to the ER because the chest pain became worse. The chest X-Ray the second day showed I had pneumonia. I was told that it could have been from the Covid-19 in December or if was community acquired.  I was prescribed with antibiotics and discharged. I still feel some chest pain  after about a week and I have already finished the full course of antibiotics. I&#39;ve seen my Primary Care physician, my cardiologist and my Pulmonologist.

                                                At approximately 4 pm, I gave the patient a Janssen covid-19 vaccination. I asked the patient to sit for 15 minutes for observation. About 10 minutes later I was notified someone wasn&#39;t doing well. I went to the patient and he was hunched down and looked pale and he stated he was very dizzy. I asked him if he had trouble breathing and he stated he had not. He appeared like he was about to pass out, I was asking him questions about his state and he wasn&#39;t being coherent. I told him I was going to give an EpiPen and call 911. I gave him the EpiPen in his outer thigh. EMS came 5 minutes later.  A few hours later I got a call from a close by asking if I had given him a Benadryl because he was feeling drowsy. I asked his status and the nurse stated he was doing fine.

                                                High fever reaching 103.8° F. Between 7pm and 12am, my fever ranged from 100-103.8° F Elevated resting heart rate of 90-130 beats per minute. My normal is 62-75 bpm. While I was sleeping, my heart rate ranged from 93-113 bpm (according to Apple Watch). Extreme headache Inability to sleep Chills and shakes Extreme fatigue Light headed and unable to speak clearly  I don?t know if this was life threatening; I know it was likely my immune system responding but these side effects were extreme. I almost called an ambulance. I?ve never felt pain like that before in my head. My heart felt like it was racing all night and my brain felt like it was going to expand out of my skull. The head pain, heart rate, and rapid breathing was keeping me up.  I tried to sleep 7pm?12am which was the worst of it. By the middle of the night, it seemed that the fever subsided and my resting heart rate was more in the 90-100 range (still 15-30% high).   The next day, I have a moderate headache that feels like after pain from the night before. Fever subsided. Heart rate is slightly high at 80-100 bpm. I managed to sleep in the whole morning.  I had to take off from work today in order to rest.

To this day (one month later) by ability to recall memories and recall words remains poor. I have troubles forming sentences because words don&#39;t come to me. To this day I cannot recall anything that happened days 1-3 after the vaccine. I was able to write this report because my partner made me take notes on how I felt. Prior to the vaccine I never had an issue with memory recall. My physical reactions cleared during the second week after the vaccine. However, the mental reactions still stubbornly persist.

The severe headache continued throughout the rest of the week 5-6 days. During days 5 &amp; 6 I noticed new symptoms- a feeling pressure/constriction in my hands/wrists. In addition, I noticed (2) bloody stools over days 5 &amp; 6 - 1 each day in the morning.  Both symptoms seemed to have gone away after day 6. However, pressure/constriction in my hands/wrists and headaches has been noticeable intermitately since. No distinct or identified activities or food-related timing during or causing the onset of the pressure/constriction in my hands/wrists or headaches symptoms thus far.

Hives eventually were limited to only arms after 3 days. 7 days after experiencing on and off hives, I took an antihistamine until hives disappeared for longer than 24 hours.  Hives were not itchy, but large and warm to the touch. No single hive lasted for more than 24 hours.  They disappear and reappear randomly on my arms. Specially over veins. It has been over a month since my vaccine and I?m still experiencing these hives that appear and disappear at random. I?ve documented each hive outbreak with photos and currently undergoing blood tests trying to learn more about this issue.

                                                I received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA at roughly 2:15pm on Sunday 4/11/21. I waited at the vaccination site for 30 minutes and did not have any adverse effects. I went through the rest of my day without any adverse effects. I went to bed at 9:00pm. I woke up at 11:00pm with body aches and chills. I could not stop shivering. I then became very warm. I alternated between freezing/shivering and burning up all night. I felt very sore and my muscles hurt. It was primarily my upper body that hurt, not my lower body. My arms, torso, back, and neck hurt to move. I was very sensitive to everything I touched. It felt uncomfortable to touch the blankets in my bed or the water when I washed my hands. It did not hurt to do that, it just felt sensitive and uncomfortable. Around 5:00am I got a terrible headache. It felt like my head was made out of a lead ball. It hurt to move lift my head. My face hurt and felt like I had pressure. This lasted all day for Monday 4/12/21. After 5:00pm I slowly started to feel better. My body aches went away. I still had a headache, but it was far less severe. It is approximately 7:00am on 4/13/21 as I am filling this out. I still have a minor but persisting headache. My left arm is sore at the injection site. I am feeling much better than I was.

I move to my bed. 7:30 PM - In bed, dressed in sweatshirt, wool socks, etc., a a couple blankets wrapped around me, space heater turned to 80 degrees, shaking uncontrollably from being so cold (mostly hands and feet), mild headache begins in middle back of head.  8:00 PM - still freezing, temperature was at 98.7. most of body is aching 9:00 PM - chills and body ache starting to slow down, temperature at 100.3 9:30 PM - still have chills, space heater still on and i was still wrapped in a bunch of clothing/blankets. temp at 100.5 and i drank 6 oz water.  10 PM - chills going away, heat/blankets/clothing still on, temp at 101. body aches mostly only in left and right calf.   Rest of night until around 4 A.M. was me tossing and turning being restless. My heart rate was ~130 BPM throughout the entire night according to my smart watch. I was checking my temperature constantly with an infrared thermometer and it was between 101-102.5. I probably drank ~24 oz of water throughout the night. It felt like each time i fell asleep, i would wake up no more than 30 min later and each time i woke up it felt like i had been asleep for 5 hours. At a few moments it felt like i was hallucinating seeing little boxes around my head.. At no point  during the episode did i take any advil/tyenol/etc. Only drank water. Woke up around noon the next day, I felt extremely groggy, still had a headache and my temperature was back to ~98.  I ate for the first time that day around 1 P.M. and had a few advil which helped with my headache.

Currently (6 days after vaccine) I have feeling of pressure in head above left ear. Pressure accompanied by slight headache, dizziness, feeling flush, stomach pain, and tingling in right hand.   These symptoms haven&#39;t changed over last 4 days, and most pronounced is head pressure, dizziness, and general disorientation.   Haven&#39;t taken medication, just getting good rest and hydration, but symptoms aren&#39;t lessening.

                                                I started feeling fatigue and soreness in both of my legs and arms about a 5 after the vaccine. At day 7 I started to feel sharp, cramps, tingly sensation and numbness in different parts of my legs, arms feet and hands. I also had headaches and felt dizzy. Headaches went away by day 15, but the pain, tingly sensation and fatigue in my arms and legs still remain (tomorrow it?s going to be a month since I got my shot). It gets significantly worse when I walk and I feel very fatigued after walking for about 30 minutes.  The pin has also appeared less frequently on other parts of my body, like my heart, my neck and around my rib area. Over the last two weeks my legs have also been getting itchy.

                                                Patient received vaccine at around 11am.  After waiting around for a few minutes he stated he was light headed.  I went over to observe and gave patient some water.  He was starting to sweat and turned very pale.  1 minute later he passed out.  I brought him to the floor from his chair and he  starting shaking and &#39;seizing&#34; for about 10-15 seconds.  We used pressure on his chest to try to &#34;snap&#34; him out of it.  After about 15 seconds of &#34;seizing,not breathing normally and his left arm completely locked up&#34; he came to and did not know where he was for about 2-3 minutes.  After about that time he started to realize where he was and recognized his wife who was assisting.  EMS was called and arrived shortly,  He was lucid and knew where he was and started to feel normal again.  EMS checked his vitals and they were normal.  Patient refused to go to hospital and EMS released him to his wife.  I checked on patient 4 hours later and he had no ill effects and stated he felt just like he did before receiving the vaccination.

He was very panicked and stated he thought it was a dream.  He was extremely pale and very sweaty.  We gave him some water and an ice pack to cool down.  We checked his blood pressure.  He then lied down on the floor and we elevated his feet.  He then stated he could not move his hands and his lips were tingly.  We then gave him some liquid benadryl and continued checking his blood pressure and called EMS.  They arrived and he left with them.  I tried contacting him later without success.  Will try again tomorrow.

                                                Overall I am a very healthy guy, rarely get sick, and when I do quickly recover. I got a cold just about 2 months after receiving my COVID vaccine. After about a week of having the cold I developed bronchitis (confirmed via chest X-ray). I highly suspect that the COVID vaccine may be causing my immune system to overact to my cold causing this bronchitis. Again I have never had bronchitis in my life and I have always been healthy. Although impossible to prove this link, CDC please take this report seriously as my wife also has bronchitis right now and research what this is doing to our immune systems. Thank you.

Once patient got outside of the door to waiting area , patient began to feel dizzy and sat down in the chair.  Patient began to sweat and show signs of impaired vision (spots) and discomfort.  Pharmacist immediately ran to get the patient soda and a bag of chips to get patient&#39;s blood sugar up.  patient immediately began to perk up.  patient later stated he had not ate all day leading us to assume low blood sugar and abrupt movement was the cause of his dizziness.

                                                Pt received JJ vaccination, and subsequently moved to the patient monitoring area. Approximately 2 minutes after waiting in the monitoring area pt states he experienced flushing, dizziness and clamminess then ?passed? out for approximately 20 seconds while in a seated position. Syncope was witness by patients girlfriend. RN didn?t witness pt syncope, but noted patient laying in the seat then immediately alerted me. Pt was recovering in a seated position when I arrived, with noted pt w/ diaphoresis with no associated respiratory distress. While I was collecting pts history said he didn?t want to talk about it anymore in an attempt to calm himself down, approximately 2-3 minutes later I witnessed pt have another syncopal episode which lasted 15-20 seconds while in seated position. Pt regained consciousness and I had an employee help me move pt to the floor for recovery. Pt displayed no signs of respiratory distress, denied chest pain and headache. Pt states syncope is his typical response after vaccinations or blood draws, last occurrence was 8 months ago during a blood draw. Pt states these syncopal episodes initially started in childhood and has gotten worse as he has gotten older, pts father also experiences these episodes. Pt declined EMS several times. Pt was monitored for 41 minutes, vitals taken twice while pt was in recovery on the floor, vitals were stable. I had pt lay supine on the floor for approximately 15 mins post syncopal episode. After recovering for 15 mins I had patient sit upright on the floor, reassessed him and repeated vitals which were stable, pt reported feeling well. After approximately 10 mins pt was helped up into a seat, vitals were stable and patient reported feeling well and having no complaints. I had pt stand and repeated vitals which continued to be stable and pt reported no complaints. Pt drove to the vaccination site in a rental care which he states he will leave parked close to vaccination site and initially states he?d walk. I recommended pt and girlfriend take a free ride home which the agreed to do. I personally walked the patient up the stairs which pt was able to do with no problem and no reported complaints. Pt was given strict ER precautions and given resources for primary care also. Pt stable at the time of discharge. Pt declined follow up.  Pt stable at the time of discharge. Pt accompanied by with girlfriend, who will get pt home via ride.

                                                Went to bed after getting my shot at 11:00 PM on 3/7/2021, feeling no symptoms.  Woke up at 5:10 AM the next day on 3/8/2021 feeling tired, sore, and a little nauseous, with a headache. These symptoms are very similar to how my COVID symptoms were in early October 2020

I had a fever around 102 degrees Fahrenheit at its peak and maintaining usually around 101.4 degrees. I was nauseous and experienced emotional instability. The adverse affects lasted until the morning with some affects such as the headaches and nausea still currently lingering on to present time (10:48am).

No treatment sought at this time.

                                                Patient received vaccine and reported approximately 5 minutes later that he needed help. Within just a few seconds following him calling for help he was not able to talk and his eyes had rolled into the back of his head. His body was rigid but he did not lose consciousness. A technician called 911.  He was sweating profusely so his jacket was removed and a cold rag applied to his head. He finally came to after approximately 1-2 minutes and reported that he was feeling very dizzy. His blood pressure was 118/80 and temperature was 98.5 degrees Fahrenheit. He was examined by an EMT, and they found a very similar blood pressure.  Patient reported feeling much better and was fine to go home. Treatment occurred over a 15 minute window.

                                                CPT administered Janssen COVID-19 vaccine to the pt 4/5. While sitting in the pharmacy area for his 15 minute observation period, he fainted. He said that he was texting on his phone and the next thing he knew, he was on the ground with people around him asking if he was ok. He stated that he was very sweaty, nauseous, and a little dizzy. We called a code white, provided the pt with a cold compress and elevated his feet. Pt did not want us to call 911. Pt did not have PCP and has not been to a doctor in about 5 years. He said he was very nervous getting the shot and is afraid of needles so that may have contributed. Pt stayed in the pharmacy area for about 45 minutes until he started to feel better and his mom came to get him. I tried calling pt again at 7:10pm to check in, but there was no answer and I could not leave a voicemail due to mailbox being full.

(Patient mentioned he had a great fear of needles prior to vaccine administration) A nearby ARNP took his blood pressure and he read very low..he was advised to lay down and elevate his feet to improve his blood pressure. He felt better. 911 was called and fire department was dispatched just in case. Fire department came and assessed his vitals. Patient started feeling better and was eventually able to sit up. He sat for a few more minutes before he left the store.

About 10 hours later body began to feel warm and then within an hour began uncontrollable shivers and aching in testicles followed shortly after by a throbbing headache and pain behind eyeballs. I put on extra clothing and jumped into bed as symptoms persisted. Later in the night I began sweating profusely and removed the clothing. The headache and pain behind the eyes persisted. I also began feeling nauseous and almost vomited when I went to the bathroom. My body was so tired and achy I could barely move. I tried to wake up for work but my headache and pain behind the eyes was so bad I went back to bed for another four hours. I did not have any appetite for the rest of the day.  My headache subsided that afternoon and I went for a walk that night and my body still felt incredibly tired and achy. The pain behind my eyes persisted. The following day I felt somewhat better and could work. That night I went for a jog and my body felt extremely heavy, my joints ached, and I could not catch my breath. My symptoms continued to improve but I have had no sex drive for a week.

                                                I had received the Janessen vaccine around 3:30pm. Around 1 am I woke up to shivering and chills. My head felt extremely pressurized inside. My eyes felt like they were being pushed out of their sockets. My body hurt. It hurt to move. My neck , knees, ankles and back were in shooting dull pain. It took everything I had to stand up. I couldn&#39;t get to sleep. I had a fever. I started to shiver. My thought raced. It began to hurt to breath. My lower chest is sore on the inside where the lungs meets the rib cage.   I could not to go class or do any work. Was easily one of the worst nights of my life.

                                                I developed extreme body aches and chills along with an extreme fever, and it progressed throughout the night until I was delirious. I fainted once trying to take medication (ibeprofen) in the bathroom. I never measured the fever because I was delirious and could hardly move due to pain. I have never felt so sick in my life and I am a healthy 30 year old with no other health issues. I am feeling better this morning but have lingering symptoms of chills and aches. I am reporting this because the intensity of the reaction seemed overwhelmingly extreme and scary for someone of my health and age.

                                                After being screened to enter the healthcare facility and completing the intake screening for COVID vaccine, patient received the Janssen COVID vaccine at approximately 11:00am.  Several minutes later while sitting in the observation area, patient stated that he felt like throwing up and that he had a headache.  He said he just started feeling tired.  He denied any shortness of breath, swelling in his mouth or throat, or rashes.  He stated he had not eaten breakfast in the morning.  When his vital signs were checked, his blood pressure was 149/94 and heart rate was 90.  He was alert and oriented.  He was transported to the facility urgent care for further assessment and observation. In urgent care, he appeared to become more lethargic, although his vital signs remained stable.  911 was called.   While waiting for the ambulance, staff spoke to the patient&#39;s brother (who had been waiting outside for patient).  Patient&#39;s brother stated that patient had a fever and stomachache the night before, and that patient had a recent surgery and had not completed his post-op antibiotic course.  Patient&#39;s brother stated that he came to clinic anyways for the vaccine appointment because he wanted to get the COVID vaccine so that he could return to work (as required by his employer).   Patient was transported to  Hospital.  Per nurse report, he was released from the emergency room after a brief observation period.

In few seconds, he started convulsing. I administer Epi-pen 0.3 mg, 1 adult dose in his left thigh. His convulsion stopped at very moment, paramedics took over from there. His vitals were checked and monitored by paramedics for few minutes. He did not require hospitalization at this moment, however advise to seek medical attention if he feels something abnormal.

                                                Immediately after injection: pain and soreness around injection site.  Starting about 3-4 hours later: impaired coordination.  The next morning: severe dehydration, disorientation, loss of balance, very low energy, headache, body aches, inability to remain standing or sitting, difficulty walking, fever, feeling hot and cold, sweating and shivering intermittently and sometimes both at the same time, impaired mental focus, worsened pain and soreness around the injection site, nightmares. Slept the majority of the day, rising only to eat and drink lots of water.  Symptoms abated throughout the day. By about 7pm, I was able to sit up enough to play some video games.  The second morning: most symptoms gone or almost unnoticeable.  Hot/cold flashes, impaired coordination and low energy continue, but improving. Attempted to go out for my usual 2-mile jog after work, but only made it about one block walking before becoming both too cold and too tired to continue.  The third day, afternoon: completed my usual 2-mile route, at a walk, with frequent stops to rest.  No noticeable symptoms from the 4th day after injection, onwards.

                                                I received the vaccine on Wednesday, April 7th.  I was told I had an anaphylactic reaction at the time of injection: I started sweating upon receiving the vaccine, my blood pressure dropped, and I almost passed out. I was monitored for 30 mins before being sent home. Other than some fatigue, I was fine the rest of the day.  On Thursday, April 8th, I was tired but felt fine otherwise.  Friday and Saturday, April 9th and 10th, I felt like I was back to normal and even did some light exercise.  On Sunday morning, April 10th, the left side of my body (side of injection) went numb, I had extreme vertigo, shortness of breath, and blotches that appeared in random places. It didn&#39;t look like hives, but rather looked like strips of red. I didn&#39;t feel like I was having an allergic reaction, but something did not feel right. I consider myself a pretty healthy guy with a healthy lifestyle. I did not feel the need to go to the ER quite yet, but I did have a friend come over to monitor me.  My friend did some acupuncture which helped resolve the numbness and dizziness and some of the blotches, and also mentioned concerns regarding blood circulation and potential clotting issues she thought I was having.

                                                I woke up in a very heavy sweat and got up to use the bathroom. I felt unsteady. After washing my hands, I turned to the towel and vaguely remember falling to the floor. When I came to, I was too weak to get up. I laid there for 5 minutes before struggling to sit. After some time I was able to weakly return to bed and drank some rehydration tablets. My best guess was I had been drinking water but not replenishing my electrolytes.

                                                Seizure - I have never had a seizure before and there is no history of epilepsy in my family. I had the Janssen vaccine shot at around 5PM on Thursday and felt mostly fine on Friday. I had typical shot symptoms (tired and soreness near injection sight). On Friday night around 10:00, I was standing talking to one of my friends in the living room when I had a blackout seizure without any warning. The seizure only lasted about 30-45 seconds, and then I became conscious again. It took me about 5-10 minutes to become completely aware and able to stand up. I have never had a seizure before and have not had one since then.  Later the following week, I did have a couple of hours where I felt extremely dizzy and lightheaded, but it went away without another seizure. This is also not typical for me.

When the exhaustion would hit, starting the day after injection, I was too weak to go up and down stairs. It seemed significant and was more than normal tiredness, and I ended up needing to take a half day at work four days after vaccination. On the sixth day after vaccination, I was feeling well again and discomfort at the injection site had subsided as well.  It was the worst the day after getting vaccinated, which was to be expected. I did not expect it to last so long.

                                                During the observation period, pt was seen trying to take off his jacket, and proceeded to pass out and fall out of his chair. Pharmacist rushed to help him up and he complained of feeling very hot and sweating profusely. He did not have any swelling/itching of throat/facial area. Patient was provided cold water, and told to remain seated. Pt was asked questions such as name, what day it is, to establish if patient was alert and oriented. Patient complained of experiencing tunnel vision while passing out. He proceeded to pass out once more, while seated, this time the pharmacist was able to support him in his chair.  After the water and rest, patient said he felt much better and his girlfriend came to escort him home. He stayed for about 30 minutes before leaving and staff made sure he was feeling alright.

                                                About 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine patient approached the pharmacy and said he wasn&#39;t feeling well. I asked him if he would like some water and he accepted. He returned to the chair in front of the pharmacy and sipped on the water. He looked like he was pale and breathing more slowly. I went out front to check on him and his breathing appeared labored, he was sweating profusely and he said he felt lightheaded and his hands were tingling. I told him to relax and take some breaths. His hands were very shaky and I took him BP (94/61 and HR 54). At this point I had my technician call 911.  Between the time the paramedics arrived he went unresponsive for approx 20-30 seconds. I yelled his name and slapped his leg. No response. I checked for a pulse and if he was breathing. He did have a pulse and was breathing. After coming to the paramedics arrived and took him to the hospital for evalution.

                                                The night/next morning after receiving the vaccine I was awoken by a racing heart rate that I measured at a resting heart rate of 200 bpm. After 5 minutes of trying to assess what was happening, I recognized that my heart rate was not slowing down. I woke my wife because I was worried and had difficulty breathing. It continued to be in the 180-190&#39;s, I called an ambulance. On the way to the hospital my resting heart rate was 180. After I got to the hospital they ran blood work, a CT scan and a chest x-ray. I was in the hospital until 10 am. My heart rate steadily fell to about 110 beats per minute after 9 hours in the hospital. They released me because my tests had come back normal. Upon being released, I came home, had lots of fluids and rest. After 1 week, my heart rate went back up to 160&#39;s. My chest started to feel tight again and I had difficulty breathing again. I called my PCP emergency number and they advised me to go back to the ER at 10 am on 05/15/2021. They did another EKG, a D-Dimer and I received saline. My heart rate dropped to 120 and they released me. I was given an all clear from all tests performed. Sunday-Wed that week, I had a slightly elevated resting heart rate, have had difficulty getting a full breath, general stomach pains and I had felt fatigued. Thurs-Sat, my resting heart rate returned to normal (60 bpm) minimal difficulty breathing, but continued pressure in my abdomen and chest. Saturday I fell asleep because I was having a migraine. I woke up at 10 pm and the cycle started again. My heart rate went back up into the 160&#39;s. I called the emergency line for my PCP and was told to go back to the ER (05/22/2021). They performed a chest x-ray, an EKG and some blood work. My resting heart rate went to 90 bpm around 3 am and was sent back home. The rest of Sunday, I had difficulty getting a full breath and my resting heart was higher than usual. I had an echocardiogram on Wednesday and it came back normal. I wore a heart monitor for 24 hours, but I have not received the results yet from my doctor. I have never experienced any sort of cardiac episode in my life.

                                                I experienced normal side effects. Aches, fever, headache, chills, fever for about 5 days. They subsided, but I still don?t have an appetite, and I keep coughing up mucous, some with what looks like blood streaks, like a blood vessel, and blood spots when I blow my nose. And my lungs feel heavy. And it?s almost impossible to breathe deeply with coughing. Although I can go a few hours without coughing. The blood is very rare but it has happened several times in the past 4-5 days. It could have to do with my vaping, but it isn?t normal, only since being vaccined.

Went to work, had a 40 min workout, and had dinner with friends (had one drink and a cigarette) .  I was in bed by 9pm and with in a few min started to get chills.  By 9:30pm I was in  sweating, shaking, headache, and had extreme body aches.  I struggled to get out of bed to use the restroom, any movement was painful.  I didn&#39;t get much sleep due to the body aches.  By 8am my symptoms began to fade.  I felt fatigued and had a headache by noon.

                                                I got vaccinated on Friday. That night, I had chills and a headache, but this went away by Sunday morning.  On Monday, I woke up and I was too dizzy to walk. The initial dizziness subsided but I&#39;m still having balance issues as of Wednesday night. A doctor prescribed meclizine which didn&#39;t help.

                                                As expected from any vaccine I&#39;ve received, I have a sore arm that is lasting over 3 days (again, this is expected). What I wasn&#39;t quite expecting: -Fever at 101 for 48 hours -Extreme fatigue for 48 hours -Alternating chills and hot flashes/sweating for 48 hours -Quite strong aches and pains (hurt to lay down, sit, stand, just existing hurt) for 48 hours -Headache for 48 hours -Itchy/sore throat around the 24 hour mark, lasting to the 36 hour mark from time of injection  Treatment: I took 400 mg of Ibuprofen around the 12 hour mark from vaccination (about 5 hours after fever spiked at 101--fever rose no higher than 101). I continued 400 mg of Ibuprofen the next morning and once more that same evening (two does of 400 mg Ibuprofen). Each of those doses brought fever down to around 99 for about 4 hours, and I felt considerably better (though definitely still quite sick--just not contained-to-lying-in-bed sick). I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen around the 36 hour mark, and that was it. Fever then back to normal range (approx 98) and feeling 95%-100% recovered all day.  Obviously none of those are life-threatening, but they sure knocked me out. Definitely way worse than the &#34;mild&#34; symptoms advertised. I&#39;m definitely not complaining, as I&#39;m overjoyed to now be vaccinated, and I&#39;m so grateful for the scientific community, the CDC, and you people reading this right now for all your work in making it happen, and doing it as safely as possible. Thank you!

Upon standing up from the laying down position, I got lightheaded, started profusely sweating, became nauseous and ultimately lost consciousness. When I regained my consciousness, there was a loud ringing in my ears and my hands were numb. I took some Tylenol, laid down and it subsided shortly after. I did not experience any symptoms as severe as this at any point again.

                                                Patient called on 4/9/21 asking about whether side effects from Janssen vaccine should still be present since he had the vaccine on 4/7/21.  Patient said he had fever within 24 hours of the vaccine and was feeling miserable (severe fatigue, chills, fever, nausea, headaches).  He said he was feeling slightly better than the first 24 hours but still feeling really bad. He has been taking Advil which has help slightly.  I advised him to monitor symptoms and to call dr if symptoms get worst and to keep us posted.    I called patient today to follow up with patient and he said that he was not feeling that much better.  He did have a virtual visit with his doctor and was prescribed azithromycin, prednisone, and an inhaler.  Patient has been on medication for a couple of days.  He will continue meds and call us if things do not improve

My wife started to drive and I as I sat in the passenger seat I started getting the chills and all the muscles in my body were shaking. When we got to town I told my wife we needed to go to the ER because I was not feeling well. That is where they did some tests and hooked me up to an IV.

When I returned, I got intense chills and a fever of 103 degrees along with some flu like symptoms. I had a slight headache. Ibuprofen helped but the next day I had similar symptoms, but they went away by the end of the day. On the third day I felt a little better, so I went for a run. I had some shortness of breath and it was difficult to breathe when I was running. I normally run 4 miles daily. The shortness of breath was present for a week after that and also started to happen intermittently even at rest. One week after the shot I saw a doctor and they did some testing but did not find anything definitive. Six weeks after the shot I went to the ER and they diagnosed with Thrombocytopenia. At this point it has been seven weeks the shortness of breath has improved, and I haven&#39;t experienced it for a few days.

Sx got worse overnight, and by the next morning he noticed additional sx of tongue numbness/tingling, so went to the ER. ER diagnosed him with allergic reaction and discharged him with a short course of steroids and Rx for Banophen.   He notes that the symptoms returned again on 4/24/21, and again this morning 4/28/21. Went back to ER on 4/24, got more steroids and sx went away. This morning bought OTC Benadryl and sx went away when he took 50-100mg.

PT advised RPH that he had a problem with needles and experienced low blood pressure every time he was vaccinated or had blood drawn in the past but had done better the last time and did not want to miss out on getting the vaccine.  RPH was prepared and patient was cared for properly.  Pt arrived at 1244 hrs and was provided vaccine at 1247 hours. Patient was fine for about 1 minute and then reported he was having trouble.  Pt remained seated in booth in chair with room to get to floor if needed.  RPH remained with patient, brought his significant other into the booth to help calm the patient as he was alert and orientated and continued to improve while removed mask and fanned with papers (pt stated the fanning was helping).  Pt was improving slowly and moving/trying different positions as he felt he was improving.  At approx 1325 hrs pt knew he needed to lie down and moved himself to floor with the assistance of his significant other and associate (did not fall nor did head impact the floor at any time).  Code White was called.  PT remained alert and orientated and was talking and stated that this was really helping.  Code Team arrived and pt was continuously monitored until he gradually returned to his feet and was able to leave under his own power.  Pt refused medical attention and refused Ambulance - never lost consciousness so no EMT was called.  Pt&#39;s significant other was able to drive them home.  Event concluded at approximate 1345hrs.

                                                Shortly after the administering the vaccine the person tensed up and became unresponsive. He appeared to be having a seizure. I was able to get the patient to the floor and he became responsive.  He said he &#34;was ok&#34;.  We had contacted EMS.  We had the patient lie flat until the EMT&#39;s arrived.  He was very sweaty and tired but he insisted he was fine.  He refused to go to the ER and he was able to get a ride home.

                                                At 23:15 (7 hours after the dose) I started to get cold while under my blankets trying to sleep. My teeth began chattering as I started to shiver. I got up out of bed to put on a sweater. With each step I took towards the sweater my body started to fully shiver and contract. After about 4 or 5 steps I could no longer move and I fell over. I started having full body spasms and full contractions. I felt like I pulled every muscle in my body trying to relax and fight the contractions. It felt like I was being tasered for about 10-15 minutes. Once I had the strength to grab my sweater I slipped it on. As my body warmed up these contraction subsided.  By 01:00 (9 hours after dose) my body temperature had spiked. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer to check my temperature but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I spiked a fever. I placed a wet cloth on the back of my neck, forehead and chest to cool down.   At 06:00 (14 hours after dose) I took a cold shower to further drop my body&#39;s temperature. It felt like a full body sun burn where you just radiate heat. I was hot everywhere.  At 08:00 (16 hours after dose) I took three (3) 500mg ibuprofen to help fight a nagging headache. I did not have much appetite for food. I regularly eat breakfast in the morning (bowl of cereal).   From 09:00 to 12:00 (17-20 hours after dose) I felt groggy. Did not seem or act like myself. Was very tired from the lack of sleep the night prior. Seemed very fatigued.  Around 13:00 (21 hours after dose) I took a 45-60 minute nap. Woke up feeling much better. I would say most / if not all symptoms subsided after 22-24 hours.

The next day my eye was more irritated, and it was uncomfortable. I had a telehealth visit and they gave me antibiotic drops. I was diagnosed by an optometrist on the five days after the vaccine with the Shingles virus. The Shingles are still present on my eye after three weeks and I am taking steroids for that.

                                                I started having a headache that became stronger. On Wednesday 3/16 I also woke up shaking and with a fever, so I decided to see my doctor.  After speaking with him, he said that was a normal reaction to the vaccine and to monitor the symptoms and if they worsen or don&#39;t go away to see him again. They went away after a day or two.

After putting on a sweater and trying to stay warm I also started to get sore. Around 8-9 hours after vaccination I decided to go to sleep to hopefully sleep of the symptoms. I was extremely cold and sore, but attempted to sleep. Around 12 hours after the shot the fever broke and I was sweating. After that I slept much better and woke up the next morning feeling fine. No further issues.

                                                I began having strange heart palpitations in the late afternoon, 5 days after receiving the vaccine. On the morning of the 6th day, I had an elevated heart rate, chest tightness and shortness of breath. It was difficult to have a conversation without having to constantly stop to take a deep breath, to ?catch up.? My lungs felt like they had substantially less capacity with a deep breath than before the symptoms presented. I had extreme fatigue, joint and muscle pain. On the 7th day, I woke up with the same symptoms, and decided to go back to bed due to continues extreme fatigue. After waking up, I felt somewhat better, until later in the evening, when all the aforementioned symptoms came back. The following morning (8th day) I felt much better, and decided to go on a mountain bike ride to see how my heart and breathing felt. I noticed some decreased cardiovascular performance, but not as bad as the previous days. Later that evening, the shortness of breath and elevated heart rate came back. On the 9th day, the elevated heart rate was noticeably better, and the shortness of breath was still present, but not as bad as before. My blood pressure remained elevated and I have been unable to get it below 135/80 range. Same issues on the 10th day. Today, on the 11th day, I attempted to go run and found that my cardiovascular conditioning was the worst I have ever experienced in my life, without exaggeration. I had difficulty with a pace and duration that I would normally complete with ease before being vaccinated. I had to cut it short, as I was having difficulty breathing and my lungs were burning. I hope that these symptoms subside and are not permanent. I was hesitant to get the vaccine for a very long time, but decided to do it based of off removal of the mask mandates for vaccinated personnel. If I could go back knowing I would feel this way, I would never have allowed this vaccine to be injected in my body. I am a healthy, athletic 31 year old male, and now I feel like I am in the worst shape of my life. I feel awful.

                                                I got my Covid vaccine on Wednesday, 5/5/21. That night I experienced the typical side effects (Chills, Aches, Pains, Soreness in the injection site on my right arm). By Thursday afternoon I was feeling significantly better. However, on Friday evening I started to feel a tightness and pressure in my chest and left arm and neck. The chest pain felt like I was having a heart attack but my heart rate was mostly normal. I felt shortness of breath  where I couldn&#39;t get a good deep breath in and I was also nauseous and had no appetite. At times I felt lightheaded and weak. These symptoms continued over the next couple days. On Monday 5/10/21 I decided to got to the ER to get checkout since I was still having chest pains and tightness. They ran a series of tests and concluded that I was just experiencing typical aches and pains from the vaccine.  My symptoms continued for another full week and at times the shortness of breath and chest pains felt really severe. By the following week I was starting to feel a little better on and off. I got my appetite back and and I was able to start exercising again. After about 2 full weeks after receiving the vaccine most of chest pain and pressure &#43; shortness of breath has disappeared and I feel better.

As per patient, it was easier to sleep at the time of reporting, but still a little harder to fall asleep. Patient reported that he was having constipation and urinations issues since getting the vaccine. It was not painful to go to the bathroom but it took a while. Consumer woke up on 31-MAY-2021, and had excruciating pain in the back, flank area. It was hurting when he tried to move anyway to the left and if he used to touch it. He felt like he wants to scream. Consumer did consult with his PHP regarding the inability to fall asleep and problems with constipation. He was given some sleep medications and advised to take cranberry juice. HCP (health care professional) was not aware of the flank pain that consumer had that day. He was advised to call PHP or go to urgent care to determine cause of pain. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from headache, and nausea on MAY-2021, was recovering from inability to fall asleep, and had not recovered from constipation, flank pain, and inability to urinate.

He sat down on the floor and the pharmacist attending him became very worried about the diaphoresis and we called 911. Patient was given water and an ice pack, by the time EMS arrived he was sitting upright again and felt fine, denied care from EMS.

                                                On Saturday, I woke up to my right arm - at injection site area - was itching. I woke up to numerous nose bleeds. I&#39;m not prone to nose bleeds. Also - consistent since Saturday, Diarrhea; muscles aches; fatigue; vomiting. Problems with keeping liquid and food down now - just started a couple of days ago. Dr called me on Friday -I was doing okay; On Monday - he called again and I wasn&#39;t doing well. Have spoken to my doctor each day. And now  (since two days ago) it feels like my skin is tearing apart and burning and that the inside of my bones are on fire. At the same time, I couldn&#39;t keep food and liquid down anymore. Autonomic immune system is in fight response since Saturday. Haven&#39;t been able to get out of bed for last two days. Diarrhea has worsened. - Have been taking Zofran - nausea med for the last two days. To subdue the vomiting. Have a new medication that I am starting today to subdue the diarrhea - can&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called. Trying to make sure it doesn&#39;t go into an autonomic crisis. Only Telemed visits so far - video appts. Have had several fevers doing this time - currently at 100 but went up to 103. I have gone to low grade too and means I have not been doing well at all - on Saturday to Sunday. (Went to high grade - Mon, Tuesday, Wednesday).

Over next few weeks, began having tingles all over both legs, including a burning/throbbing sensation in my calves. I also noticed any physical exertion could lead to extreme light-headedness where I felt like I was going to pass out. This stopped within a few days. By week 3, I began having pretty significant (and constant 24x7) joint pain in both knees, making it difficult to walk. I have never had issues with my joints before and am healthy / active / young. I did not change anything about my routine or life, and my doctor agreed it was likely from the vaccine so I am reporting it here. The joints in my fingers also become painful if I spend too much time typing or on the phone. It&#39;s now 2 months of this joint pain and really hoping for some relief soon. Please contact me or my doctor if you have any thoughts or updates!

A few minutes later pt began sweating and feeling dizzy. He tried to lie down on the floor, but passed out. He hit his face and got a bloody nose, scrape on his cheek and swollen lip. He came right to and notified us of what happened. He stated he had only eaten applesauce for breakfast. We gave him some water and crackers. He started feeling better. We had him sit in the waiting room for a while, probably about 30-45 minutes. He stated that he felt fine. We offered medical assistance, calling 911, or calling to have someone pick him up, but he refused all. At that point, he said he felt much better and was ready to leave. He said he felt fine to drive home. His mom was meeting him there.

                                                The vaccine was administered to the patient at approximately 1135am. A few minutes after the vaccine was administered, the patient started feeling faint, dizzy, and sweaty (patient was sitting in a chair at the time).  He also experienced some tingling in his hands and feet (like they were falling asleep). The patient laid down on his back on floor. The patient said he did not want 911 called. The patient started feeling better after laying down. The patient&#39;s blood pressure and heart rate  were checked at 1150am (while still lying down) - blood pressure was 115/68, heart rate was 69. The patient said he had something similar happen once before when getting a Meningococcal vaccine.  When feeling well enough, we had the patient sit up on the ground. The patient sat on the ground for a few minutes to acclimate, and then stood up and sat in a chair. The patient reported he was feeling better and continued resting in the chair. The patient reaffirmed he did not want us to call 911 or a family member to come be with him. The patient left the pharmacy around 1215pm after reporting that he was feeling better.

                                                Woke up in middle of night with headache. Thought maybe tired from getting up early but have had fatigue and muscle aches (lower back, arms, ankles, head, chest). Been tired through the day...not so bad that I was unable to work. Took Tylenol and that helped lower the body aches...but only lasted 4-6 hours.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the injection, I became dizzy and lightheaded. My  eyesight became blurry and my hearing very &#34;tinny&#34;. I felt nausea and  thought I was going to throw up. I sat down in a chair and was given a granola bar and some water. After about 3 or 4 minutes the majority of these  seemed to fade, but I still felt slightly &#34;off&#34;. Approximately 9pm that evening I felt very fatigued, so I went to bed. At approximately midnight, I woke up shivering, extremely cold, and sweating. Around 2am I had a fever of 102.3. I took some Tylenol to try to bring my fever down, which seemed to help. Around 9am the next morning my fever was gone, though I still felt extremely fatigued.  Later that evening, after several naps, I started to feel a little better. Most of these adverse events were resolved by 28 hours after injection. I had arm soreness at the injection sight that felt like having been punched in the arm for about a week after the injection.

Approximately 40 minutes after having received the shot, I lost the ability swallow. A tingling sensation took the back of my throat and eventually felt as though it moved into my head. The whole experience lasted a couple of minutes. Since that time all other symptoms have been normal, sore, slight fever, etc.

I was laying in bed with a hoodie and sweat pants on and could not stop shaking from being cold. Then 30 mins later I was so hot I had to take everything off. It kept going on like that till the next morning. I just now started to feel better around 10 am the next day.

                                                April 9 Morning: woke up with a mild headache. April 9 Afternoon (12 pm): feeling fatigued and headache grew worse. Plus chills. April 9 (5pm): feeling very cold and tired (worse than noon) April 9 (11:30pm): This time was the most severe for me in respect to side effects. I believe my headache woke me up. The headache was so bad that my eyes hurt as well (swollen almost). I think my fever broke. I felt very ?heavy? all over. The main concern was that around midnight I was having sharp pains on the right side of my body, near where my Liver is located. That was one effect that I did not read about. The sharp pains happened once every few minutes. I considered going to the ER but wasn?t sure. I ended up just changing my shirt, got some water, and went back to bed.  April 10: My appetite was not normal, I ate but very little. The sharp pain on my right side went away but I had a minor headache for the rest of the day.

Then got the chills pretty bad as I laid down to go to bed. Became really sore all over.  Couldn?t stay asleep for more than an hour. Later in the night I started sweating and felt really hot. Also became quite thirsty. During the entire night I also had horrible dreams. After about 5am things started improving. Had some light sensitivity in the morning for a shot bit. By noon I was almost back to 100%

I had to get up and did not sleep again that night. I also experienced a slight difficulty in taking deep breaths. All of my muscles were sore and continue to be so 36 hours later, though that is improving. I did get normal sleep the following night.

                                                I typically faint when getting shots or blood drawn. I did faint about 10 seconds after the initial shot injection. I was conscious throughout but was not able to speak clearly or control my body even though I could hear everything going on around me. After 30 minutes, I was feeling back to normal. The remainder of the day I felt drowsy and a little out of it. At 12:15am I began to get severe chills and shakes. This lasted throughout the night but was the worst from about 12:15-1:00am. I woke up at 4am with a fever and sweating. My entire body was stiff and in pain with aches specifically in my arms and legs. Very sore pain in my left deltoid where the shot was injected and is still slightly sensitive. It felt like my veins were stiff and in pain and it hurt to move. I had what I can describe as flu like symptoms (i.e. my teeth hurt, my body ached, fever, shakes, body stiffness and overall tiredness and weakness). These all lasted until about 6:30am at the worst and were relieved over the next few hours. I started to feel back to normal around 3pm later that day. That was April 11th. Last night, April 12th, I had trouble sleeping because my left arm was in pain from my elbow to fingers. It was a lingering pain that went away by this morning and  is mostly gone now (morning April 13th).

Around 5 hours after injection I was overcome with extreme lethargy and had to sleep. 8 hours after injection I woke up very nauseous and could not stop salivating, however I never puked. I woke up again 18 hours after injection and felt nauseous and my chronic back pain had returned. I also had a weird throbbing pain in the right side of my neck and in the lower left side of my left leg. All symptoms were gone by ~36 hours after the injection.

                                                I opted for the J&amp;J variant and received it on Monday at 1:00 PM, mere hours before they pulled distribution of it on the national level.  I started feeling flu like fatigue, body aches, and a headache 8 hours post injection. I ran a 101&#43; fever Monday night and got less than 4 hours sleep due to fever and fairly intense muscle aches. On Tuesday morning the headache, fever and muscle aches persisted till the late evening accompanied by general fatigue. By 9:00 on Tuesday night I was feeling significant improvement and slept well Tuesday night with minor night sweats on and off. Wednesday morning I felt 80% back to normal. No fever, minor headache only evident when standing up quickly or sudden head movement, and continued muscles aches body wide specifically in the neck and chest as well as injection site muscle soreness. These symptoms continue to persist into Thursday at the same or perhaps slightly elevated levels. Friday 4/15 symptoms persist with generalized soreness, fatigue, headache,  injection site soreness. Not his typical self.

                                                I experienced a sudden onset of symptoms approximately 7 hours post-vaccination. Symptoms started with severe chills, elevated heart rate, fever (~102), and progressed into muscle and joint soreness, severe migraine with sensitivity to light, and strong fatigue, coupled with insomnia. The symptoms were severe enough that I considered going to the hospital, but ultimately did not. Fever, chills, and elevated heart rate subsided by the next morning (~12 hours after onset), but muscle soreness, migraine, and fatigue lasted for another 12-24 hours, along with a loss of appetite.  I am an otherwise healthy, male adult with no outstanding medical conditions whatsoever. This was one of the most severe immune responses I have ever had, including actual illnesses. I have received other vaccinations in the past and never had any response nearly as severe. I was significantly concerned for my overall health during the height of the vaccine response, and I wanted to report this to ensure that is aware of these types of responses, and can help prepare others by informing them adequately of the types of responses to expect from the vaccine. This response very much took me by surprise in terms of severity -- I had to call out of work at a critical time.

                                                This is a comprehensive neurological evaluation for a very pleasant right handed 32 year old gentleman who denies any past medical history who presents to the hospital with several day progressive visual changes and facial weakness. Patient reports he noted on Saturday that he had somewhat of a headache, he does get headaches from time to time in particular while looking at screens the television, he did have some associated blurring of his vision as well. This was not the worst headache of his life. He had no other associated symptoms. He went to bed on Saturday, he awoke on Sunday and went out to eat and noted that he couldn&#39;t form his mouth around the utensil, his face and lips and mouth felt weak. He still did have an intermittent headache and perhaps some neck pain as well at this point. His vision was still blurry. He denies any recent trauma, no car accident no whiplash no falls. He did go to an outside facility where a CT brain was performed and was normal he was told. He has noted yesterday that he could not close his eyes unless he did it manually, also he notes the way his voice sounds is different to him. He has not appreciated any weakness of his arms or legs. He is able to lift up his head off the bed without trouble. He does not think he has a hard time swallowing or breathing per se however he does describe that he is more &#34;aware&#34; of his breathing. He describes paresthesias of his face and around his mouth. No recent URI or diarrheal/GI illness, he did receive the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID -19 vaccine March 31st. Seen and evaluated in the ED with ed staff. He does report he recently ran a virtual type marathon over the course of 16 days. Clinical context and exam most consistent with that of GBS type variant (?Miller Fisher).  Treated with IVIG.  Symptoms improved after 1 dose.  4 more doses pending.

                                                Covid-19 vaccine JJ: 32 y.o. male w/ no PMH presenting 2 weeks after receiving his Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID vaccine after having severe L calf pain found to have thrombocytopenia.    From H&amp;P on 4/21, Patient reports that he had both fevers and aches after his vaccine (4/8/2021). Several days later developed low back pain radiating into his left leg which he initially attributed to sciatica. However, several days later, he went for a 6 mile hike, and felt that his left leg was hurting more. He went to PCP, where he received a blood test and was found to have a platelet count in the low 60s. This was initially thought to be a lab error, but he noticed that his left leg was swollen, somewhat red, and appeared that his blood vessels were swollen. This swelling resolves when he is lying down, and is worsened when he is standing. He received an US to r/o DVT, which was negative. However, after his repeat platelet count demonstrated thrombocytopenia, he was sent to the ED. He denies any recent leg trauma, though he has broken his leg before nearly 15 years ago.  He denies weakness or issues going to the bathroom. Denies chest pain or shortness of breath. Denies chills, fevers, but did wake up last 2 nights drenched in sweat. He also reports a petechial rash on his legs.   As of 4/22, medical team suspects Vaccine-induced thrombocytopenic purpura (VITT). VITT requires 1) thrombocytopenia, 2) documented clot, 3) positive PF4 Ab, and 4) recent AstraZeneca or J&amp;J vaccine. He meets criteria 1, 3, and 4. He has clinical signs of DVT but does not have a documented clot. Patient has L calf tenderness and prominent pooling of blood and vein engorgement of the L leg when he stands up. Possible that he had a DVT or multiple that cleared and now he has post-thrombotic syndrome. This is consistent with the pooling of blood with gravity and relief of symptoms with elevation. As he has had 2 negative US for DVT, unlikely that he has an unresolved DVT. abdominal and head CT are neg for thrombosis.

                                                Patient had standard side effects (fever, fatigue, muscle soreness) day 1 and 2 after vaccination. Starting approx. 3 days after vaccination, patient started noticing altered smell and taste, which has gotten worse in the 14 days since vaccination. Patient also has fatigue and has been experiencing weakness since vaccination. These symptoms are identical to the symptoms the patient had with COVID (starting ~3 weeks after contracting COVID and lasting over a month). The patient contracted COVID in December 2020 and had fully recovered prior to vaccination. Recrudescence of symptoms appears to be due to immunological response to the vaccine.

Immunizing technician immediately called the RPh over to assess the patient. RPh instructed technician to grab blood pressure (BP) cuff and bottled water. BP did not register on cuff, the patient&#39;s pulse was 54. After a brief unresponsive episode, the patient became responsive &amp; drank water. Then became sweaty and unresponsive 2 more times. RPh monitored for 30 minutes and will check in on 5/8/2021.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after injection I began experiencing extreme fatigue. This was soon followed by uncontrollable shaking and chills. As this progressed I began to experience extreme aching pains all over my body, a headache, and dizziness. I fell asleep somewhere around 11pm or 2 hours after on set of symptoms. I awoke multiple times in the night to body aches and a head splitting migraine. During the night the chills and shaking turned into a fever and sweating. At 6am the next day I forced myself to take some painkillers and hydrate. The body aches had started to recede at that point but the migraine was extremely painful and It was nearly impossible to open my eyes with a hypersensitivity to light. I slept on-and-off through the next morning and nearly all symptoms stopped by 1pm on May 8 or 24 hours after the injection.

Vitals were checked and blood pressure/pulse were normal. Ice was applied to patient&#39;s wrist and neck. Patient was till complaining he was not feeling well and was sweating.  Pharmacist had patient lie down on the floor. Paramedics were called to the scene. They also checked his vitals and they were good. Patient refused to go to hospital and stated that he was feeling better.   Everything happened right after the patient received the vaccine. It was not a delayed reaction.

I do not suffer from asthma prior to this vaccine. I experienced headaches, fatigue, congestion, my ears were plugged and I also developed a rash on my arms and I also noticed a lymph node in my neck that I did not have prior to the vaccine. When I went to see my doctor my symptoms were not as prominent and the lymph node in my neck is decreasing in size.

His symptoms went away on Sunday morning. Since then he has experienced nose bleeds multiple times a day since Sunday morning. This has been happening every day for approximately 5 minutes total per day (multiple instances). He stated that his past medical history only consists of poor circulation. Pt has already contacted his primary care physician.

                                                Roughly three hours after getting the shot I was very cold and developed a fever of 102.8. I vomited that night. I took an ibuprofen to help reduce the fever then slept. For the next six days I had an on again and off again low grade fever and was nauseas most of the time. Sometime during those 6 days I developed intermitted tingling in my left hand, primarily by index finger. This continues to today happening roughly once a day.  On rare occasion my right had will do the same thing but that is far less often. I never had tingling in either hand prior to my vaccine. I also developed heartburn occurring roughly 1-2 times a day. Prior to the vaccine I rarely (1-2 times a year) had heartburn and I have not changed anything about my diet or lifestyle since my vaccine. Occasionally my head feels &#34;foggy&#34; as well and this began sometime after the vaccine but I can&#39;t recall exactly when it started. It&#39;s not a headache, more of a slight lightheaded, dull feeling. I had none of these symptoms with any regularity until I was administered the vaccine.

                                                Patient began sweating profusely approximately 10 minutes after his vaccine.  He went to his parent&#39;s car and asked his father to turn on the air conditioning as he was hot.  he then passed out in the back seat of the car.  His mother came inside and asked for assistance.  I grabbed an epi-pen and ran outside to the car.  Patient was breathing and had a pulse rate of 64.  He aroused shortly after I began asking him if he could hear me and asked if he could tell me his name.  He was pale (notably his lips were quite pale) and confused.  He could not say his name but could nod appropriately to questions when asked.  We immediately called EMS for assistance.  They arrived within 4-5 minutes and transported the patient to hospital.

Shortly afterwards while waiting in pharmacy area, we were alerted that the patient was unresponsive by his wife. Immediately responded to patient. Code white called and management responded. Tried to get him to wake up, he opened his eyes but immediately closed them again. I attempted to keep him alert and eyes open. This proceeded to go on for several minutes. Ice packs were placed on neck and wrists. Feet elevated. Once patient was alert and oriented, water was provided and patient was instructed to take small sips. Patient was kept in pharmacy area for additional 15 minutes once he was back to normal. Patient stated that when he passed out, he felt tired, couldn&#39;t see or hear.

Suddenly I began to get tunnel vision and felt as if I was about to pass out. I was transported via ambulance to Medical Center where I was given IV and medication to treat vertigo and massive head pain/migraine. Since that day I have continually dealt with severe neck and head pain leading to migraines causing visual issues (auras and blind spots), vertigo, and nauseau.

                                                At around 4 am when he came to bed, he lay down and started convulsing. It was like he had an extreme chill but his body was so tensed up and he could not control his muscles or his breathing. He kept convulsing and was unable to control it for about 20 minutes. He asked if he was having a seizure but he was cognitively aware with no trouble speaking and so I told him it was not. His muscles hurt but I assume that was from the prolonged tensing of them. Later that afternoon he complained that his whole body was sore- arm, back, etc. He also has a headache and sore throat. Things to note- he has been running low on sleep (about 3-4 hours a night) for about 5 days leading up to the vaccine date.

                                                I gained about 30lbs went from 155- 185 (weight increased about 5-10lbs every 2 weeks) body muscle mass grew? shoulders, back chest, quads etc grew, do have fat but it looks like I bulked up when I haven&#39;t worked out since COVID. Prior COVID, I went to martial arts 4 times a week and went to the gym 4-5 times a week still. My awareness was not good, hand dexterity was not as high, concentrating was not easy for long, high blood pressure, pre diabetic now,  fatty liver, gallbladder stones/sludge, have high wbc count, rbc count high, high alt/ast range is 44-88-116-222, skin sensititivty, could only stay awake for 6 hours at a time.  BTold to introduce coffee to help liver/ keep taking baby aspirin/ put back on Dexilant 60mg. When working out, I go to sleep within an hour of running 1 mile,  weight lifting gets me extremely tired now, now its not as bad, can work out longer.  In may, all my allergies disappeared, now they are back but in first month I was no longer allergic to fruits. This is new and started in June, pimples on skull and ears, voice is normal now, may have grown taller, leg shins hurt when touched. Skin still very sensitive, awake longer now  but when I work out I still get tired where I have to stop, sit, or nap.

A week after chest pain started occurring.

                                                6 or 7 hours after getting the shot I started to feel a little sore and achy all over my body, it felt like I had the flu for 12 hours. The muscle achiness has persisted and has gotten worse over time. The first day it was my whole body, the next day it was less. Then my legs and arms were really tired. If I lift my arm to get a cup it feels really heavy. I do not feel tired but my legs have gotten worse, it constantly feels like they are really achy and tired. Mainly in my knees. I went to the doctor about 3-4 weeks after my vaccine, so early May and they told me to rest for 6 weeks and come back and if that persisted they recommended me to go to the orthopedic surgeon. He did an x-ray in both knees and prescribed me medication.

I drove home from work and by 6PM I had severe chills, I was shaking so bad I could barely fill a cup of water and take ibuprofen, the water was sloshing out of the cup. I had a fever of 102 and spend the rest of the evening in bed, shaking. By around 10 PM the severe chills had subsided and my fever was 101.  I did not sleep much during the night due to a headache and alternating chills/sweating. This morning it is 7 AM and my temperature is 99.5 and I am beginning to feel more normal. I took advil at first and then tylenol every 4 hours during the night.

Patient was then given fluids and lime soda that helped the patient come back to total consciousness.

Moreover, I recommended that the patient does not go snowboarding as he was thinking of heading to the mountains today.

                                                I started to feel light headed and a bit dizzy around 8:00 PM on the day of vaccination.  The symptoms progressed to feeling week and having a chill by 10:00 PM.  I woke several time during the night feeling hot and uncomfortable.  By the time I woke up at 6:30 AM the following morning those symptoms had gone.  I had a bad headache in the morning and took acetaminophen which helped alleviate the headache.  I have felt a bit weak and tired through the day.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  First day after getting the shot I got a feeling of being very tired throughout the day I did not feel like to do anything. Also my arm was very very sore. Even moving it slightly a bit would hurt. The second day is when things got way worse I could not really sleep that well throughout the night because I noticed I had  body aches in my legs and my back. Throughout that day I also felt like I had a fever in the morning I took my temperature and had a 100 fever. At night time I took my temperature and it went up to 102, with  still a bad headache, chills, and body aches throughout my legs mostly. I also felt some palpitations. When I went to bed I was sweating very prefusively all night that I had to change my shirt. On the third day I felt a lot better, still with a slight headache no fever, and still feeling like im sweating on and off.

I parked my vehicle and didn?t feel well so I switched seats with my girl friend. As soon as I got into the passenger seat I was out. She said My eyes rolled back in my head and I started shaking and eyes at this point she said where going up down and side to side . She ran for help and after about 1-2 minutes I  woke up. I thought I passed out so I instantly put my feet on the dash of my car and the pharmacist gave me water and chocolate milk.  He then checked my heart rate it seemed good  and after 20 minutes he let us go home.

                                                After administration of Janssen vaccine 0.5mL, pt reported arm was hurting and he began moving arm.  CMA noticed that continued to shake arm after 5 minutes but patient was alert and oriented x 3.  CMA thought the way he was shaking his arm seemed irregular so she advised pt he would be taken to an observation area for further observation.  Half way to the observation area, pt reported to CMA that he was seeing spots and felt like he was going to get sick.  CMA called for help.  Patient experienced a syncopal event just as he made it to the chair.  Several staff was helping to support patient.  Legs were lifted to another chair.  Patient was not responsive for a short time, very diaphoretic, breathing regular and unlabored.  Patients eyes then rolled upward toward the ceiling and patient&#39;s entire body began shaking uncontrollably while staff managed to keep patient from falling to floor from the chair.  Once patient was conscious, he was able to state his name but reported he was very confused and could not think clearly.  He was able to sit upright.  In the meantime while patient was shaking uncontrollably, staff sought urgent care provider to come and see patient.  Patient was then taken over to the urgent care side of the building to evaluate and treat patient.

On the day following the injection, I began developing a headache.  I didn&#39;t think twice about it until the headache didn&#39;t go away on the second day, the third, the fourth, but finally the fifth day it seemed to subside.  The intensity was severe and was concerning due to how long it lasted.  I had simply assumed that it was normal side effects.  Yesterday on Monday, 04/12/2021, I developed severe and sharp pains in my stomach/abdomen that actually put me in bed all day.

Headache resolved within 24 hrs after which I was able to rest and recover, while having a low grade fever and minor fever on day 2 (48hrs). Total recovery took 3 days. The reason for reporting is that this headache was unusually severe and prevented me from sleeping, delaying recovery.

I got up to go to the bathroom and upon finishing, I felt my heart rate skyrocket and felt faint. I immediately went back to the bed where I lost consciousness. My wife said my eyes were open and my body was rigid. I came too within a minute of that and was breathing heavy and sweating and very fatigued. My wife had called 911 as I was coming back to consciousness. The EMTs checked my vitals and all was normal. They asked if I wanted to go to the hospital, and I said no. My back was extremely sore all day, and I developed small red spots around my eyes. I went to my doctor later that day and told them about it. They took my blood for tests, which I have not heard back about, and they did not conclude anything, but did set me up with an appointment for an MRI of my head, given my past history.

For about 30 minutes I saw a white spot on the peripheral  view of my left eye.  By Monday, I felt dizzy and bottom right part of my chest hurt when taking deep breaths. The dizziness and chest pain lasted all week, still feel feel it today 4-18. My doctors office told me vertigo was a common side effect. On Thursday 4-15 every time I bent down and tried to get up, my right leg hurt as if I had exercised. At the moment I haven?t gone into work since Monday 4/12 since my job requires a lot of physical work.  I have mostly been home  resting  but don?t feel ready to go back to work. If someone  calls can it be a Spanish speaking person please.

                                                Within maybe 20-30 minutes of vaccination, I noticed a small dull pain in my right calf;  I disregarded and walked back to the car.  This pain has reduced over the last week, but is still vaguely present.  5-6 hours after vaccination, headache and strong sinus-headache.  Laid down to rest.  I woke up around 20-30 minutes later with full body tremors and muscle spasms.  Muscle spasms particularly violent in my back, feeling similar to if someone was involuntarily using one of those muscle-stimulator elecrode pad systems on  me;  could feel each individual muscle tensing and releasing at random.  Tremors and spasms persisted and then diminished over the next 4-5 hours.   99.7F fever was recorded.   Chills, fever, nightsweats, and repeated sleepless rest/waking every 30-40 minutes until the next day.  Headache was still strong and present at 4am,  took 600mg ibuprofen and continued hydrating.  Headache, general soreness, and fever persisted for ~3 days, but manageable with hydration and rest.  On day 3 a rash appeared on both my knees/innerthigh just above the knee.  Likely not hives, subdermal red speckles that appeared at night;  close to 4mm in diameter, skin was warm to the touch and very itchy.  Most of the rash was gone by morning, and the itching and warmth was completely gone.  I have noticed a very similar rash appear on my front left collar/shoulder area just this morning, but no itch/warmth.  Outcomes: Muscle spasms/tremors subsided within a day. Fever/headache subsided within 3 days Knee/Thigh rash gone. More similar rash just appeared on upper left shoulder/collar. Upper calf dull pain still present, but only barely  &#34;It feels a bit off&#34; would be the best description.

He received the J&amp;J covid vaccine on 4/8 and felt well afterwards. Last Friday (4/16) he began to experience constitutional symptoms (fever to 100.4, chills, night sweats feeling drenched, decreased appetite) so decided to get his labs drawn as an outpatient for further evaluation. Symptoms progressed until Tuesday, when they began to subside slightly. At that point, his labs resulted and were notable for thrombocytopenia. He got his labs redrawn the day before admission and it was noted that his thrombocytopenia was worsening, so he was directed to the ED for further evaluation.  Patient seen by hematology, started on dexamethasone 40 mg PO daily as well as IVIG treatment x2. MRV of brain without evidence of dural venous sinus thrombosis  ***PATIENT CURRENTLY HOSPITALIZED***

It has been a whole weak and nothing major changed.  Since yesterday he has what they described in the beginning, depression in the left side of his heart, shortness of breath and rapid heart beat.  He has not called his doctor or gone to the ER.  He now has BP monitor and it has been morning, while on the phone he did his BP and it was 147/102.  This is a little bit lower than it has been.  Oxygen level right now is 98, BPM 97.

Then started to feel  itchy but no rash appeared. after about 20 minutes didn&#39;t feel better so gave 25mg benadryl capsule and called 911.

On closer inspection his eyes were closed, body limp, and head back.  We tried to ask if he was ok and grabbed his arm and held him up.  We were getting ready to place him on the ground and he regained consciousness.  Patient said after vaccine he became drowsy and sweaty. Incidence lasted 2 minutes and he stayed at the pharmacy for at least 30 minutes post vaccine.

My heart was racing and tingling, it felt like chills inside of my body. I became weaker and my heart jumped to 90 bpm. I became pale, disoriented, and my jaw tightened. I had no respiratory issues but I had a little troubling swallowing. I met with a Teladoc doctor who said that if I didn&#39;t get better by 6pm, to go to the ER. At 5:20, things calmed down and the reaction stopped. I felt very tired.

His hands were flinching into fist and pt was unresponsive.  This lasted about 20-30 secs.  We called ED and got the operator on the phone.  When we started to give the operator information, pt starts waking up.  Pt&#39;s mom didn&#39;t want the ambulance to come since pt is now awake so we told the operator everything is fine now and hung up.  Pt&#39;s forehead was sweaty and facial color was very pale.  We gave pt some water to drink and asked pt to continue to sit there and relax.  Pt has no idea of what happened he said he just remember one moment talking to his mom and the next moment she was holding him up.  Pt sat there for a total of about 1 hour and he said he was fine so they left.  We informed mom and pt to please go the UC or ER for follow up but they declined.  They said they will have him rest and hopefully things will be OK soon.  I checked his Blood pressure x 2 and both times they were good at around 128/87.  Gave mom my pharmacy business card to call with any further questions or concerns

                                                Patient received dose of Janssen Covid vaccine in right deltoid. He chose the right arm because his left upper arm is fully tattoed. Patient sat for about 5 minutes and then he got up and fell forward on our counter in the waiting room. After about a minute he got up and sat on the bench for a few minutes. We discovered him after about 10 minutes lying sideways on the bench. First BP reading was 86/63mmHg and patient was clammy and sweating. His major complaint was fatigue. He took a sip of soda and ate a peanut butter cup. EMS arrived his BP had gone up to 120/68 mmHg. Oxygen levels were normal but patient refused to allow EMS to check his blood glucose.

My knees and all my joints were hurting. And that happened until the end of the night and the next day there was nothing, I felt okay. I am having a really bad cold now. It started last Tuesday. A little sneezing, runny nose and dry cough and now it&#39;s a lot of mucous and feeling tired in general. Me and my partner also got it at the same time and had the same Johnson and Johnson at the same time. I talked to Kaiser (e-visit) and they told me to start using Cold and Flu - and prescribed an antibiotic - Doxycycline Monohydrate - 100 mg for 7 days - 2 caps per day. It&#39;s the worst cold that I&#39;ve had - it&#39;s a really, really bad cold. Never had one this bad before.  I&#39;m still not 100%. I still have dry cough, mucous and a little tired.

At approximately 6:00 P.M., patient&#39;s companion alerted pharmacist that patient appeared to be unresponsive. Patient was slumped forward and momentarily unresponsive to verbal queues. Patient quickly (within seconds) became oriented and stated he felt hot and sweaty. Pharmacist called 911. Patient denied difficulty breathing and reported no swelling or difficulty swallowing. EMTs arrived within 10 minutes. EMTs determined that patient most likely experienced vasovagal syncopal episode. Patient was allowed to leave on his own accord by EMTs with instructions to seek medical attention if difficulty breathing developed. Duration of entire case was approximately 25 minutes.

                                                Around 8 hours after the vaccine, I started to feel very cold.  At around 16 hours I measured a temperature of 100.13 deg. F.  Also a slight headache, and soreness near the injection site.

Felt basically normal by the time I left the facility and my arm has not been hurting since.   Approx 8:00 PM onset of headache, progressively worsening thru ~11:00 PM and plateauing. Headache was less by ~8:00 AM, and took Ibuprophin at 9:00 AM to further alleviate.   Approx 9:30-10:00 PM onset of chills and shivering, progressively worsening thru ~11:30 PM. Chills lasted through the night, but shivering stopped around 12:00 AM after turning the heat up and putting on more clothing, beanie, and blankets.   Fatigue is ongoing (as of now, ~22.5 hours after administration), but may be a result of poor sleep due to the chills overnight.

                                                Patient received vaccine around 3PM CST and proceeded to waiting area for the recommended waiting time. Within a few minutes of receiving the vaccination, around 3:05PM CST, patient complained of feeling dizzy. Patient was carefully laid down on the floor, given a pillow to protect his head, and feet were elevated. Patient was extremely sweaty and lightheaded/dizzy. Patient maintained consciousness and expressed that he was beginning to feel a bit better once he was lying down. He was provided a cold bottle of water if needed. Patient refused dispatching an ambulance, which I believed to be an acceptable option as he was already improving and never lost consciousness. A blood pressure cuff was obtained and his blood pressure was 138/94 pulse 69 at approximately 3:15PM EST. He did not know what his BP typically is, but I felt comfortable that he wouldn&#39;t likely pass out with this BP. He wanted to set up due to feeling better, so we cautiously helped him do so. After having him remain seated on the ground out of caution, he requested to stand up. He stated he was feeling much better and expressed at that point he wanted to leave. His girlfriend was with him and would be driving him home. It seemed that his symptoms had fully resolved by the time he left the waiting area and assured me he felt okay.

I recovered well enough to drive home within 15 minutes afterwards. That night (10pm) I began shivering, which escalated to periods of convulsions, to which a mouth guard was needed to prevent chipping teeth and/or biting my tongue. There was no fever present, and to subside the uncontrollable shivering I sat in a very hot shower until motor functions gradually returned. Periods of headaches, joint pains and sweating ensued for the remainder of the night. There were no other symptoms in the following days.

                                                After vaccination, patient appeared to be slouched over in chair in observation area.  Two bystanders approached him and held him to prevent him from falling from his chair. Patient was diaphoretic and eyes half-closed. Attempt was made to arouse patient by talking to him and rubbing chest. His head and body moved erratically for approx. 3 seconds.  Patient was lowered to the floor. Nurse continued speaking to patient and rubbing his chest.  He then opened his eyes and was startled. Patient abruptly sat up and said, ?what happened and where is my phone?? The nurse reassured him he was being taken care of and she asked if he knew where he was?  Patient replied, ?I have no idea.?  A paramedic approached and asked the patient if he knew his name.  The patient correctly replied. The patient had no recollection of what had taken place, but did know where he was. Patient was then evaluated by the paramedics.  All tests performed were normal and patient refused to be transported to hospital.  Patient was driven home by his wife.  Follow up phone call to patient yesterday evening with no answer.  Follow up phone call to wife (listed as emergency contact), 4/7 at approx. 6 pm.  Per wife, patient experiencing fatigue and still very pale. She said he just wasn?t himself. Patient was concerned that they did not know what to expect a week or two from now.   I advised patient that if she had concerns, she needed to have patient evaluated in ER.

                                                BLOOD CLOTS IN LEFT LUNG; TIRED; FEVERISH; This spontaneous report received from a consumer concerned a 34 year old male. The patient&#39;s weight was 175 pounds, height was 67 inches and Body mass index (NR: not provided) 27.4. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included non smoker, no personal or family history of clotting disorders and no recent trauma or travel. The patient was active and ran for 30 mins every day. The patient received COVID-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of administration not reported, batch number: 043AZ1A or 043A21A) frequency one total, dose was not reported, administered on 05-APR-2021 at 10:15 hours in left arm for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 05-APR-2021 in the evening, the patient experienced &#34;normal side effects&#34;, specifically tiredness and fever (temperature was not taken) and he took 2 Advil and went to bed. On 06-APR-2021 in the morning, he felt back to his normal baseline. On an unspecified date of APR-2021 (08-APR-2021 or 09-APR-2021), he felt pain and tightness in his chest and difficulty breathing. He noticed that he had to work harder to do his daily run. On 13-APR-2021, when the symptoms did not improve, he went to the emergency room. The patient had blood was taken (results not reported). A computerised tomography (CT) scan showed 2 blood clots in the left lung and duplex scans of both legs did not reveal a clot. A chest x-ray was done but results not provided. The patient&#39;s COVID-19 test was negative, and he was admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous heparin. It was reported that no oxygen was given. On 14-APR-2021, he was discharged with Eliquis which he should continue for 6 months.  On 16-APR-2021, the chest pain was gone, and his breathing was better in the morning but still difficult later in the day. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from tired, and feverish, and was recovering from blood clots in left lung. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This 34 year-old overweight male (BMI 27.4) was hospitalized for 2 blood clots in his left lung 8 days after receiving vaccination with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. He had no chronic medical conditions, was a nonsmoker, no personal or family history of clotting disorders, no recent trauma or travel, and exercised every day. On the evening of his vaccination, he felt tired and fever (temperature not taken) and took 2 ibuprofen and went to bed. The following morning, he felt back to normal. Two or three days later, he felt pain/tightness in his chest and difficulty breathing; he found it more difficult to perform his daily exercise. Eight days after vaccination, when his symptoms did not improve, he went to the emergency department where a CT scan showed 2 blood clots in his left lung. Covid-19 testing and duplex scans of his legs were negative. Blood tests were performed but results were unknown. He was hospitalized for 1 night, treated with IV heparin, and discharged the following day with apixaban. As of the time of this report, the chest pain had resolved and breathing was improved in the morning but still difficult later in the day. Based on the limited information (e.g. absence of blood test results), the relationship with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine is considered indeterminant.

                                                T&#43; 4 to 6 hours: mild fever, fatigue. T&#43; 1 days: mild fever continues, hot flashes begin, mostly at night interrupting sleep. T&#43; 2 days - 7 days: fever subsides, hot flashes increase in intensity significantly, continuing to interfere with sleep. Other possible androgenic symptoms begin to arise: change in body odor, sex drive, motivations, appetite. T&#43; 7 days till current: previous symptoms of days 2-7 continue, extremely gradual onset headache begins one night. Making sure to rule out hydration and electrolyte imbalance expecting headache to be gone in the morning after sleep, I found that it was only worse and that an interpolation of the two pain points from when I went to sleep and woke up would have created a almost imperceptibly gradual but linear increase between the two points. The headache was of a type I had never had before, located in the center of my head just barely dorsal to the spinal insertion. It felt deeper than any headache I had had before which usually occur in the frontal lobe/neocortex zone. I do not regularly suffer headaches getting maybe a couple per year. Once I recognized androgenic involvement and the headache were continuing I took myself to the ER where I was evaluated and despite presenting with continuous hypertension and the symptoms mentioned above, I could not get them to perform a estrogen test and they let me leave with hypertension without any investigation. I&#39;m returning today to their urgent care facility to try again to get my estrogen levels checked. I had left a message on the phone line of VAERS prior to the original ER visit but had not heard back from anyone so I felt it was prudent to file a written report here.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  About six hours after receiving the vaccine, I felt a sudden lack of energy followed by uncontrollable shivering. I developed a low-grade fever that persisted for three days. I treated the symptoms with over-the-counter medications. I did not see a doctor. The symptoms went away on the fourth day after receiving the shot.

                                                Started experiencing extreme chest pains (stabbing feeling) between my lower right breast and upper rib cage on Saturday afternoon, especially when trying to take a big inhale. I went to the emergency room the next day after pain meds (ibprofen) did not help, and they did an EKG and X-Ray and they said it was a muscle strain. I went home and alternated between 3000 MGs of Tylenol every 24 hours, 2400 MGs of Ibuprofen, 8 hours of 4% lidocaine patch and then off for 8 hours &#43; and a heating pad when the patch was off. The pain in my chest got worse and worse on Mon and Tue (started having spasms in the chest that caused extreme sharp shooting pain down my back up into my head) so went back into the ER Tues night.

                                                After my J&amp;J vaccine, I experienced fever, chills and a left sore arm and those symptoms resolved in 24 hours. On 04-06-2021 I experienced headaches on and off and on 04-07-2021, I had light headiness, an air-filled pressure sensation to my eyes, forehead, more like a sinus headache. On 04-14-2021, I went to see my PCP due to my headaches continuing, the doctor ran complete blood panel test were performed along with a D-dimmer test to rule out blood clots and he told me to take Advil as pain medication.  My D-dimmer test was normal. I noticed when bending down my headaches became worse. On 04-20-2021, an MRI of the brain was performed. On 05-01-2021, I experienced muscle body aches, fever and continued with headaches. I went to a walk-in clinic, where a Covid-19 test was performed and it was negative. I started taking antibiotics and the fever and muscle bode aches started to go away. I still have to this day headaches and an air-filled pressure sensation around my eyes and eyebrows.  As of today, my headaches are consistent, and they come and go.

                                                Patient was advised to remain in observation area for 30 minutes due to history of breathing difficulty with sulfa antibiotics in past. Shortly after being vaccinated the patient presented to our service window stating he did not feel well and was immediately escorted by the pharmacist to our administration area to have a seat. He stated he felt light headed, flushed (though not visibly), felt like his heart was racing, and was not having diffuculty breathing but felt like he couldn&#39;t catch his breath and stated he thought he was having a panic attack. He had stated before vaccination that he had not had a vaccine since his routing childhood schedule, his whole family had already had doses, and he had been putting it off because he was nervous. He insisted he needed some fresh air several times and was escorted outside by the pharmacist (with emergency supplies and a cell phone and within shouting distance of the pharmacy) for continued obsevation and was given water when requested. After a few minutes he stated he felt much better and the symptoms had resoved. He was directly observed outside per his request for the remainder of his waiting period and had no further symptoms. He was instructed to call the pharmacy right away if he had any additional symptoms after leaving.

We laid him on the floor and he started to shiver and said he was cold. We monitored his pulse and contacted emergency services. An ambulance came at 10:45 AM and they asked which vaccine he was given and took over care of the patient. We gave the paramedic the EUA facts sheet for the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine and they took the patient.

About 8 hours after the injection, I could feel my heart rate rising. I tried to sleep and experienced disturbed sleep. At 3:00 am I woke up and felt terrible. I checked my blood pressure, and it was normal at 105/61, but my heart rate was 99. My resting heart rate is typically  about 50. My heart rate doubling provided a terrible sensation. I could barely walk and shuffled around outside to get some fresh air. 3 hours later, my heart rate started coming back down but took a day to get back to normal. Even now, I have lost my appetite, am not eating much, and I just slept 16 hours. I have never experienced any vaccine such as this.

Around 1700, fatigue returned. Took a 3 mile walk between 1700-1800. Consumed two beers @ 7% ABV between 1800-1845. Around 1830 began feeling tingling, chills and muscle and joint pain which continues. The pain is similar to DOMS that occurs after a robust workout; did not have a robust workout today. I&#39;m fully functional, able to eat and able to otherwise function, so the symptoms are manageable.

                                                Just before bed, about a week after getting the vaccine, I started to itch on my feet and arms. I fell asleep and woke up at about 3 AM with incredibly itchy skin from the tops of my feet all the way up to my shoulders. It was so itchy and uncomfortable that it woke me up. I took 2 Benadryl and put some anti-itch lotion on, and was able to fall asleep. I woke up the next morning feeling groggy, but better. The itch has not returned at all in the week since this happened.

                                                Terrible body aches starting at 8pm on April 1st.  Then had the chills.  Was able to take ibuprofen and slept for a bit.  Next morning April 2, got a migraine where it hurt to open my eyes.  Had that for about 2 hours then got better.  Also, I had trouble eating.  I would take a small bite of crackers and feel like I was going to throw up.  Took me a long time to eat a package of crackers and to drink 1 whole bottle of gatorade.  I took more ibuprofen through the day and that helped.  Around 5pm that night I was able to eat a little more and drink some with out feeling sick to my body.  Around 9pm that night headache came back and I went to bed for the night.  Today April 3 I feel a lot better.  Body still aches a bit and feels like I?ve been sick for 2 days so will probably take today and tomorrow to fully recoup.  No headache today.  Just small aches and tired.

                                                Patient felt light-headed, then became unresponsive. He moved both arms halfway up, and they both quivered simultaneously. I called for help. One nurse raised his legs &amp; another put a pulse oximeter on patient &amp; took his BP. Patient started responding to verbal cues. A nurse gave him Gatorade to start drinking. He was drenched in sweat from head to feet. The nurse continued to take his BP, which did hit 120/~70, but then dipped again. Once his BP &amp; pulse stabilized, he was able to go home. Patient ate a full meal &amp; a non-diet soda. He reported being exhausted ~4 pm. He fell asleep &amp; rose once to urinate.  Dr. at a Family Medicine practice checked his heart and lungs, and confirmed this did not appear to be an allergic reaction, but more likely was a vagovasal reaction. Patient started reacting ~10 minutes after the injection.

Slept poorly all night due to body pains. Woke to muscle aches and slight join pains, which worsened throughout the day. Low grade temperature appeared at noon the day after the shot, and stayed into the night. Headache began around 5PM and got worse. Tylenol helped at 7PM. Slept from 7:30PM to 7:30AM. Felt back to normal by morning.

                                                About 6/7 hours after the vaccination, I experienced fairly violent chills/shakes and the beginnings of a headache. I went to bed and woke some hours later with a 101-102-degree fever and muscle/joint aches (at the injection site on my left arm and throughout my body; I especially thought the joint aches in my legs and hands).  Now, about 27 hours after the vaccination, my fever has reduced to 99 degrees, my chills/shakes are gone, and my headache is mostly gone. The primary symptoms I have are the remaining sight fever, continued joint/muscle aches (mostly in my legs) and fatigue.

                                                I received vaccine about 4:00 PM. I felt fine until I went to bed about 10:30 P.M. I got extremely teeth chattering cold and could not get warm and began to have a small headache. I awoke about 2:30 A.M. and was extremely hot. I went downstairs to bathroom and the next thing I know my wife is shaking me to wake me up laying on the floor. My wife said she heard me fall and discovered me in the bathroom floor. She woke me up and I stood up and exited the bathroom and collapsed in the hallway. My wife awoke me again and I didn&#39;t know what occurred. My wife called 911 and EMS responded and assessed my condition. I explained everything that occurred and that I had my J&amp;J vaccine hours earlier.  My vitals were taken and my condition was evaluated. I had a bad headache that felt like my head was in a vise and my knees and chins hurting a bit from the fall I was fine. I just did not recall collapsing either time and I was distraught when my wife woke me both times. That&#39;s what I was informed by my wife. I don&#39;t recall anything after urinating to being woken up by my wife and I was on laying on the hallway floor and my wife was on the phone with 911.

The patient had a gatorade and rested for about an hour and his wife drove him home. I called him 2 days later to check in on his status and he said he got a good nights sleep and felt much better with just a sore arm.

                                                At roughly 8 to 10 hours after injection I started developing a minor fever, fatigue, slight loss of appetite, lack of focus, chills and aches. Signs and symptoms continued to worsen throughout the night and next morning. Unable to sleep due to an increase in chills, fever progressed to 101.3F, developed a severe headache, aches were more prominent, same with fatigue. Loss of appetite went away. Started taking cold medication in the morning which either helped reduce the signs and symptoms or I had already experienced the apex of the adverse events. Fever was reduced, same with the aches and chills. Everything is fairly minor now, but the severe headache continued to to be present untill a second round of cold medication. Still fatigued when writing this at 9:30pm at night despite sleeping the majority of the day.

The next day I had a very strong headache all day and couldn&#39;t get out of bed due to no energy, chills and body aches.  Was in bed sleeping on and off until 4:00pm, or roughly 24 hours after the shot.  Intermittent doses of Tylenol helped with symptoms to allow sleep.  After that 24 hours I felt substantially improved.

My left arm is extremely tingly, almost as if it?s asleep. As of this evening (4/18/21 around 7:30 PM), I am also experiencing this tingly sensation on the left of my face as well. It feels like pins and needles, and is very bizarre.  I?m extremely confident in saying it?s in direct correlation to the shot.  Please advise.

This is a 35-year-old male with complex past medical history including bilateral lung transplant and renal transplant performed several years ago.  He both of them and regarding his transplant management.  He is on immunosuppressive medications.  He is here today out of concern for exposure to COVID.  He was vaccinated with Johnson Johnson vaccine on  3/4.  He is here cause overnight he started developed fever headache sore throat muscle aches.  If continued through today.  He was test in the outpatient setting but the results have not yet returned.  He is here today with continued symptoms.  He is well-appearing on exam but mildly tachycardic, low-grade temperature here no significant increased work of breathing no conversational dyspnea lungs are clear heart is regular but tachycardic without murmur he has no signs or symptoms of DVT currently.  His chest x-ray shows all isolated left lower lobe infiltrate.  His labs are unremarkable with normal renal function, normal electrolytes but is rapid COVID test is positive.  Given his immunosuppressive status in infiltrate seen on x-ray initially recommended admission for observation even though he is not initially on any supplemental oxygen is work of breathing is quite comfortable.  I was able to discuss with his transplant surgeon In addition I talked to admitting physician who then discussed with pulmonology here .  In their opinion the best management for the patient would be to provide him with the monoclonal antibody treatment but this can only be performed in the outpatient setting given he has no increased work of breathing no supple ox requirement currently that he is stable for discharge.  He has a pulse monitor at home will also enroll him in a COVID home program.  Pulmonology will call him for follow-up tomorrow.  When I discussed with  they currently do not have any beds available at the hospital for transport.  The patient does not want to go to an outside facility that has a transplant team other than the risks of.  Ultimately the patient would like to go home.  I will add doxycycline for bacterial possibility of his pneumonia seen on x-ray today.  He also had very strict return precautions.  He understands likely had a possibility of worsening symptoms understands to return immediately if any new or worsening symptoms or no improvement.  Patient was given the monoclonal antibody treatment in the ER after ordered by Dr..  He will ultimately be discharged with very close follow-up.

                                                During the evening around 6pm after I started developing symptoms consistent with the flu.    Fever reached 104 around 8pm.  Uncontrollable chills also were present.  A severe headache followed.  I took fever reducing meds immediately. Confusion and trouble breathing happened during the fever and chills period.  An attempt to go to the hospital was unsuccessful because I lost consciousness while attempting to find phone/car keys.   After I woke up, I felt less confused and could catch my breath, so I decided to take more fever reducing meds and see how I felt in a few hours - this was around 11pm.  Around midnight my fever broke and the chills stopped, but the headache was at the worst it&#39;s been. The headache lasted the entire next day as well.      I wanted to go to the doctor, but was physically unable to and had no one to alert.  I do feel better today.  I have some weak headaches that come and go, along with muscle aches, but I feel that they are minor enough.

                                                The patient walked in to the pharmacy for a Janssen Covid vaccination along with family. Patient was advised post vaccination administration to sit in observation for 15 minutes but did not comply and as he was walking away from the pharmacy fainted. Parents reported he did not hit his head and pharmacy was alerted post fall of what had happened. We approached the patient as he was getting to his feet and we advised again for him to come back to pharmacy to sit in a chair for further observation. His parents told us he always has fainting issues post any vaccination or blood work (no prior issue reported to vaccinations on consent form). The patient continued to decline going back to pharmacy and as he walked fainted again, he was able to hold on to shopping cart which lessened severity of fall. Pharmacy staff advised him to remain on floor and after he regained consciousness he was able to answer accurately his name, where he was and what day of week it was. At that time a nurse not employed by Company was shopping near by and began to help care for the patient. The patient and his parents continued to decline calling an ambulance, and after several minutes sat against a wall. He was starting to sweat profusely and heart rate was rapid (approximately 145 bpm per nurse) so we had him remove his coat and provided a cool compress for his head and neck. He was breathing rapidly but was able to slow his respiration upon our direction. The patient did not seem to be improving and the nurse helping advised calling EMS which we did. The patient continued to lose consciousness for brief periods awaiting and during EMS aid. EMS ran the patients blood pressure, blood sugar nd ran an ECG prior to taking patient away to hospital (results unknown to pharmacy as we stayed in area to provide information on patient vaccination administration but had no active assistance  care at that time.

                                                The night after receiving the vaccine I started to develop a fever and headache. It lasted 3 days for the fever. On Tuesday I felt something different in my body. On Thursday I went to see an Optometrist. While there he found that there was something going on in my eyes. He noticed there was blood clot in the back of my right eye. I did go to the ER because of the blood clot. At the ER I had a CT scan and bloodwork completed. I was told that everything looked normal and I was told to go to a different hospital. I was transferred to  Medical Center. While I was there they performed an MRI, CAT scan and Lumbar function test. I was told that everything looked fine from the neurology point of view. I need to follow up with an Ophthalmologist. I have gone completely blind in my right eye and my left eye is not clear anymore. On 05/20 I had an appointment with the ophthalmologist. There was something wrong with my optic nerve as well. There was a test performed 05/21. I went back to the doctor on 05/26 he said that the reports he received are not making sense to him. My next f/u appointment with Dr.  is 06/09 because the doctor asked to have2 weeks to read through my hospital reports. I saw a different doctor instead on 05/27, Dr. , and he said that this can happen from the vaccine. He said that there is a swelling and I need to see a different doctor about my retina. I was told that I need to see another physician. I saw Dr. .  on 05/27 and he said that there are fluids there, but no one can confirm that this is because of the vaccine. He gave me the option to take prednisone 10mg and I feel that it is working, but it is very slow. It was moved to 3x per day. I can see objects now even though it&#39;s still not clear. I have a f/u with Dr. 06/03.

                                                Symptoms started ~10 minutes after injection.  I began to feel dizzy.  I felt very warm and began to sweat profusely.  My vision got cloudy.  I was given water.  The pharmacist measured my blood pressure, and I believe he said I was 70 over 50.  I began to feel like I was about to pass out, so I laid down and gradually began to improve.  I began to feel very cold instead of very warm.  About thirty minutes later, I felt well enough to leave the pharmacy.  After a couple hours, I began to experience what I think are more typical symptoms - stiffness and pain in the arm which received the shot, and chills.  The next day, I experienced sore wrists, shins, and lower back; fatigue; headache; and hot &amp; cold flashes with uncontrollable shivering or sweating at times.  These symptoms were alleviated about 42 hours after the injection, except for persisting mild pain in the arm had which received the shot.

He then had stated he was feeling dizzy and had an episode of syncope.  He remained in the chair but was not able to respond to me.  His mother was present and I called for assistance and she came into the room at which point the patient was able to respond to me verbally but he reported being confused, feeling nausea and fatigued. He was visibly sweating.  His mother reported that he had previous episodes of syncope when having blood draws or other injections.  He remained seated and I offered multiple times to contact emergency medically services but he and his mother wanted to just wait as he usually feels better after a short time.  We did give him cold water bottles which his mother used at the nape of his neck.  We also provided him with wet paper towels.

                                                On April 19th, 16 days after vaccine administered, massive headaches began that left me bed ridden for roughly 2 weeks to a month afterwards. Severe headaches lasted all day with no breaks. Only relief I would have would be from laying down with head in a certain position.   A month after initial symptoms, the pain started to subside, but very slowly, taking several more weeks to calm down and to feel reduction in pain. Pressure would also set in around brain when pain was becoming less.  Several tests had been done after symptoms began which included: Bloodwork Lipid CT Scan without contrast CT Scan with contrast MRI without contrast  On June 15th, I was notified by my Neurologist that the MRI, which had been performed on June 10th, had showed a mild stroke had recently occurred.  I am now on blood pressure medication, as well as aspirin 81, reduce the likelihood of another stroke.

Brain fog affects daily life and work. Restless legs. Difficulty sleeping. Tingling in legs and feet. Anxiety. Onset occurred the day after vaccine was administered and there has been no abatement of symptoms since onset. My doctor did extensive blood work as well as antibody testing.  Antibodies were negative as of 7/20/2021. All other tests were within range/negative, except for elevated immature granulocytes. Ability to carry on daily life and work is greatly impaired by these symptoms, especially the relentless fever and inability to sleep. Health care professionals are unable to give me any time frame within which I can expect symptoms to stop.

That evening sleep was irregular with waves of chills and excessive sweating.  The following day a headache continued until about 12pm and then the body seemed to go back to normal.  Two days after the initial vaccine there has remained consistent muscle weakness in OS (left) knee and numbness in OS leg from the knee down. There is also infrequent dizziness. Both symptoms are becoming more regular.

By March 30th my heart start beating out of my chest and I felt like I was having a heart attack.  I could barely breath.  Went to get something to eat, walked half way and felt like I would fall on the ground, and returned to my room.  Called my parents because I wasn&#39;t sure if I would wake up the next morning. My team leader gave me a ride to the emergency room. They drew my blood and it was dark and thick.  They sent me home.  Still feel fatigue.

                                                I had an intense fever within 5 minutes of the administration of the shot. I was sweating profusely, experience nausea and then fainted and had a mild seizure. After coming to consciousness, I vomited and the pharmacy staff called the paramedics. I was extremely pale and the fever persisted for several minutes while waiting for the paramedics. I recovered and felt mostly normal after being given saline solution and anti-nausea medication. Hours after being released from the hospital, I have waves of cold chills and hot flashes.

I gave him some water to drink and mountain dew, and I had him lay on his back for several minutes. The patient said he felt better and more alert after laying on the floor. After 10 minutes, I had him sit back up, he was feeling much improved. After 10 more minutes, he wanted to get a snack before he left. I requested he come back after the snack just to check in on him after he had walked around. The patient left the pharmacy feeling normal again.

He started feeling sick and got up to go to the restroom. On his way to the restroom, he passed out and fell in the hallway. We then got him to a seat and gave him some water and orange juice. The patient was adamant that we not call an ambulance for him, so we made the patient stay seating under our direct supervision. He sat in the waiting room for about an hour until someone could come to pick him up. By the time someone arrived to take him home, he seemed to be doing much better.

Myalgia in legs happened immediately. No fever at this time.  Woke in morning with no fever, but muscle aches, malaise, lethargy, parasthesia were all present. Spent entire day in bed napping occasionally.  Measured temperature in evening at 100.7F.  Painful stomach pain happened in evening. Patient never gets acid pain or similar so this was very abnormal. Antacid helped but stomach pain continued all evening at a lesser degree.  When going to bed most symptoms had subsided. Still some parasthesia and Myalgia. Woke up on 4/9 feeling much better after lots of sleep.  No fever or other symptoms on morning of 4/9.

                                                A patient received his vaccine and went over to sit in the waiting area.  A few minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient called me over to let me know he was feeling dizzy and felt like he was going to pass out.  I was able to have him lay on the floor and elevate his feet.  He was visibly sweating.  I got him an ice pack and put it on his forehead.  He never ended up losing conciousness and felt better after laying down for 5 min or so.  He eventually sat back up and stayed in the waiting area for a while longer to be monitored.  He eventually felt fine and went home.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine . I went to bed early, at 8:15pm. Within 5 minutes, I began to have uncontrollable chills. My body shivered and my teeth chattered like never before. I live in cold state and it was not a cold night, relatively speaking. I generally find cold nighttime weather easier to sleep in. I had to turn on a room heater, get fully dressed in warm clothes, and use an extra blanket and heating pad to warm up. Within 4 hours, I became warm. But, then I began to feel too warm, and my body went the opposite direction. Now, I was sweating. I took everything off.  That eventually stopped. Then I developed a head cold, at least that is how it felt. My nose became stuffy. This morning, I woke up at 5:30am and feel better.

                                                On the evening of 4/8/2021 at around 8 pm I began experiencing an upset stomach (felt like I might throw up) and then shaking in my stomach started and I got a lot of chills and a headache.  Then I spiked a very high fever and sweat like crazy.  I was shaking like crazy and had to call a doctor on call twice.  I had full body pain and was very sleepy.  The fever and chills lasted a bit over 2 days but unfortunately the pain  in my body had not gone away.  Currently (4/14/2021) I have pain in all my joints and my neck and back and I noticed a rash around my right knee. I have felt very tired. I have felt some mild shortness of breath, which may be seasonal allergies (discussed with a nurse earlier, my oxygen levels are 98 percent today, so I am breathing fine, but there is a sensation of shortness of breath) . I have consulted my primary care office about the above and they are speaking to the doctor.  I am trying to limit my exposure to any hospital setting until the 14 days (2 weeks) is up from the vaccine.  Hopefully these symptoms will go away soon and hopefully none are related to a blood clot issue.  We&#39;ll see if my doctor or you guys may recommend a future platelet test?

                                                Two days following vaccination I started having tingling in my feet.  Often it felt like pins and needles, and eventually more like a burning sensation.  My understanding is generally we would refer to this as neuropathy.  It comes and goes in my hands as well.  I&#39;ve had some significant leg pain in my hip off and on, and a couple of headaches, but the consistent for more than  two weeks has been the neuropathy issue and it is not going away.

When they went to check on him today they found him deceased in his chair.  Further investigation would be needed.

I told him that I had a flight later that night and didn?t want to have any side effects on the plane.  He assured me hardly anyone ever has bad reactions to it and was very salesy, not seeming concerned much for my health or my questions, more like he needed to meet a quota. Against my better judgment, I got the shot and was absolutely miserable on the flight and that whole night. I developed a fever, body aches, headache, chills, and fatigue around 8 hrs after receiving my shot. It was one of the worst nights of my life with a fever reaching 103.5, and that was with Tylenol in my system to try to keep the fever down.  I didn?t feel normal for 3 days.

The top half of my spine has discomfort at its best and mild/modern pain the rest of the time. It&#39;s constant. At times my spine feels cold and tingly. Then my entire core gets cold and tingly. I&#39;ve never had back pain or injured my back. This pain is directly related to the vaccine and my experience seems to be outside the norm of side effects subsiding after a couple days.

                                                For 2 days, typical arm soreness, flu-like symptoms with significant muscle pain and general weakness and malaise. However, on the 5th day, EXTREME abdominal pain, left side. Pain level up to 9. Incapacitating. Two visits to urgent care. This was in March before any info came out about adverse blood clot events for the J&amp;J vaccine, so the doctors were not really interested at the time that I had just gotten my shot. They gave me antibiotics, thinking it may be diverticulitis (diagnosis based on symptoms only - no diagnostics - it was the doctor&#39;s &#34;best guess&#34;). Pain did not subside, only got worse. 4 days later I could barely move, abdominal pain was extreme. Went back to clinic and they did a PET scan to check for diverticulitis. There was none; PET scan revealed nothing out of the ordinary. So they told me they had no idea what it was and sent me home. PET scan reading by the doctor notes specifically that blood/vascular was not able to be observed because no contrast or dyes were used. Bottom line was over 10 days of extreme abdominal pain 5 days after receiving the shot. I&#39;ve never experienced anything like that before.

                                                36 Y male patient from another country with a past medical history significant for mild HTN (on 2.5 mg amlodipine) who was in his usual state of health until approximately 4/17/21 when he developed acute onset left volar forearm tingling sensation. He had received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine on 4/2/21 in his left arm and states that he did not experience any noticeable reactions after vaccination. He also recalls having had sustained a minor superficial scrape on his left volar forearm by a trash can lid when he had taken out garbage, which occurred very shortly before the onset of this tingling sensation. The tingling sensation then progressively worsened and became more diffuse across most of his body. He then developed fevers up to 102 at home, chills, neck pain, headache, and pain in all extremities (primarily arms but also in his legs).   He initially went to the Health Care ED on 4/28/21. He was afebrile at the time and his vital signs at that time were unremarkable with the exception of elevated diastolic blood pressures (90-104 mm Hg). WBC 10.1 with normal differential, electrolytes and liver enzymes within normal limits. Influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 PCR were negative. Urinalysis showed few bacteria but no WBCs. Chest x-ray was clear. Blood cultures were drawn and patient was then discharged.   Patient returned to the ED on 4/29/21 and reported fever to 102-103 d F, chills, nausea, weakness, body aches, and bilateral foot paraesthesias. He was afebrile (98.8) and his vital signs were within normal limits. His WBC was slightly elevated to 12.2 with a normal differential. His ESR was 11, CRP 1.5, CMP within normal limits. He was noted to have urinary retention and a foley was placed and he was given tamsulosin.    Patient then returned to the ED again the following day, on 4/30/21, with worsening generalized pain and weakness and difficulty walking.   ED course: temperature 101, heart rate 100s-110s, BP 140s-160s/70s-90s, RR low 20s, SaO2 high 90s. Labs remarkable for WBC 13.1 with 82.4% N, ESR 7, CRP 5.9, lactic acid 2.6, RF 10, urinalysis unremarkable, HIV antigen/antibody negative. Several imaging studies were performed. MRI T spine showed &#34;Extensive cord signal abnormality in the cervical and thoracic cord as detailed above, with associated expansion of the cord (most pronounced in the cervical cord). Differential includes acute transverse myelitis, demyelination, infection (HIV, syphilis, other viruses)/parainfectious phenomenon, subacute combined degeneration, and inflammatory etiologies. An underlying mass or masses are not excluded but less likely given extensive multifocal patchy involvement. Recommend postcontrast imaging at this time for further workup. Consider brain MR as well to assess for systemic white matter disease.&#34;   A lumbar puncture was attempted in the ED but was unable to be performed.   Patient was given empiric IV ceftriaxone 1 g q24h and admitted to the hospitalist service. He was evaluated by neurology and was started on Solumedrol 1000 mg for acute transverse myelitis.   5/1/21 MRI brain showed &#34;Multifocal patchy white matter signal changes, predominantly in the subcortical white matter, also present in the bilateral thalami and bilateral middle cerebellar peduncle, and redemonstration of extensive cervical cord signal abnormality and expansion. No associated restricted diffusion or enhancement. Broad differential, but given pattern of involvement findings are most concerning for ADEM (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis), other considerations include other demyelinating processes, toxic-metabolic pathology, or potentially atypical viral infection.&#34; Patient was given methylprednisolone for ADEM with transverse myelitis and clinically improved. He was hospitalized from 4/30/21 until being discharged to home in a wheelchair on 5/6/21.

A headache came about 2 hrs after and a little later I developed a fever and the headache went from light to mild.  Throughout the night I could not sleep because the headache had gotten so severe and I had uncontrollable chills and shakes and a fever.  3/6 I did start around the clock Tylenol which did reduce the fever and make the headache less as intense but for about 2 days the headache so bad with pressure  associated it felt as if my eyes were going to bulge out of my head.  By day 3 I woke up feeling better but was in a fog which lasted the remainer of that day and by day 4 all symptoms had subsided

Extreme mental fog during 24-48 hours after vaccine injection.  After initial 48 hours after vaccine injection, experienced tightness in chest with a slight bias to left side.  Also still experiencing very faint feeling of headache since injection.  This seems to cause slight mental fog and has remained as of writing this 2 weeks after injection.  At 72 hours after injection, tightness or pressure moved across entire upper chest collar area, and down left arm and up left side of head behind left ear and into the back of the head, and then finally to the top of the head.  Pressure/Tightness discomfort seems to effect left hand nerves... effecting typing  on keyboard with left hand fingers.  Pressing on left and right collar bone pectoral areas exacerbates irritation.  Adverse symptoms after initial 48 hour period have remained the mostly same for almost 2 weeks period.

Around 7:45AM I started to feel slightly short of breathe, but figured it was just from the cold outside and my Asthma. The shortness of breathe feeling goes away. Later in the day sometime after 3 PM, I start to feel as if I am getting stuffy. I take a nap on the buss on my way home, and when I wake up I suddenly feel like I am freezing and have chills all throughout my body. I get home and jump in a hot shower to warm up, but it did not help. I then heat up some food to eat dinner, and I go to drink some soda, and I notice I have no taste. I figured the soda was flat, but even flat soda has some taste to it. I then drink a Cherry Gatorade, and still no taste. Now I check my temperature and it is at 101.4, and I have a slight cough.

                                                I started to feel extreme fatigue around noon the day after but what I found very concerning is I lost probably 80-90% of the strength in my arms.  I couldn&#39;t palm a ball i had for the kids which i normally can easily.  I had chills and nausea as well.    I can&#39;t really remember much from that day and it feels like a big blur.  I woke up the next day feeling very irritable with brain fog.  Today its gotten better and I am hoping tomorrow I will be back to normal.

                                                Patient came in for Janssen COVID vaccine that was scheduled electronically online.  All appropriate prescreening was done and patient had no previous allergies or issues.  Patient was instructed to sit in one of the chairs designated for post vaccine observation.  Within minutes (less than 3), patient was very dizzy, clammy (cold sweats), pale and said he did not feel right.  I assisted him to a sitting position on the floor from his chair and we were able to ease him back to a lying down position from there with his head on the floor and feet elevated above heart on a chair.  Patient said that the cold floor actually made him feel better instantly.  At 4:18pm after lying down for about 3 minutes we checked his blood pressure with him still lying down.  It was 110/88 and pulse of 104 (so slightly elevated pulse).  He said he was feeling better and we kept him lying down.  Patient&#39;s wife was also there so she was able to provide information in addition to him doing it also.  She did state that he occasionally had panic attacks and she thought this might be one, the patient was adamant that it was not.  At 4:24 pm we checked his blood pressure again and it was 100/90 and Pulse of 104.  He was feeling quite a bit better so we had him come to a sitting position on the floor and he had not eaten in a while so we got him a granola bar and water.  Pt slowly ate these and begin to feel clammy and sweaty again within 3-4 minutes. We checked his blood pressure again and it was 104/90 and pulse of 100.  He wanted to stay sitting to see if it would pass.  We did continuously observe injection site and screen for any other symptoms of an allergic reaction (nausea, cramping, swelling, and none of these were occurring). Since he was still not feeling well we gave the patient 50mg of benadryl (20 mls of 12.5mg/5ml liquid benadryl) with his approval. After about 10 minutes of sitting total he was still having cold sweats and feeling dizzy so we had him lie back on his back with his feet elevated while the benadryl kicked in.  By 4:50pm he was feeling well enough to sit back up and we got him some wraps and a coke from the cafe to eat.  Pt continued to consistently improve and was ready to leave about 5:20pm.  We advised him and his wife of signs and symptoms of allergic reaction and to have those treated to immediately at urgent care or and ER.   We also told him to follow-up with his PCP.  I had a manager help walk them to their car.  They were very kind and grateful.  I will follow-up with a call tomorrow and again on Friday to make sure he continues to do well.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received my dose at 3pm on March 12, and experienced no adverse events until about 5 or 6 hours later. Between 8pm and 9pm, I felt a bit tired, though wasn?t sure it was vaccine-related at first. However, I shortly afterwards started feeling much more tired, and experienced chills and shivering. I went to sleep. My wife later said I felt very warm, though we did not measure my temperature.  During the night, at one point, I got up to go to the bathroom, and became very dizzy and nearly fell over, though I was able to catch myself and did not experience any fall or injury.   I went back to bed. At some other point during the night, I started sweating. My wife later said I felt cold at that point.  For most of the following day, Saturday, March 13, I no longer felt dizzy nor overly hot or cold, but had a migraine and mild nausea. I did not vomit, but I also ate very little during the day. I did eat a little in the morning, and had some water throughout the day. For the most part, I laid in bed, drifting in and out of sleep.   At about 7pm on March 13, I took two Tylenol to try to fight the headache. By 8pm I felt almost completely better. I ate more bits of food, and have felt fine since then. Sunday, I woke up and felt back to normal. I ate normally as well.

I could simply not get warm or comfortable and tossed and turned for hours. Felt like I had the flu. Finally fell asleep around 2am. Woke up the next morning around 6:30am and took Tylenol but no longer had a fever or chills. I felt drained and tired throughout the whole next day but unsure if that was vaccine related or simply due to lack of sleep. Slept fine that evening and had no other effects.

HR 70, BP 110/60, RR 18  We gave him some wet paper towels for his head and asked  him to focus on his breathing. We kept him in the observation area for a total of 45 minutes.  He still wasn&#39;t feeling great when he left, but he said he wanted to go home and lie down. He only threw up the one time, but he did have some dry heaving once more after his vitals were taken.

Then progressed to severe shaking chills, fevers, headaches, tingling/electric shock feeling in back of head/neck, muscle aches, mild joint pain, eye discomfort associated with the headaches, poor appetite at first, trouble sleeping, and fatigue; all of which required doses of Tylenol and ibuprofen and cold packs. Symptoms lasted all night and fever broke overnight after finally falling asleep. The next day (3/17) took some more Tylenol and ibuprofen, but the fever and chills subsided. The other symptoms mostly resolved except was still quite tired and felt weak. Also, had cold sweats all day on 3/17. By around 3/18 most all of the symptoms resolved.  Also, had mild soreness at vaccination site throughout.  I?m a physician. If I wasn?t a physician I may have sought medical attention.

One week ago, on Friday, March 26, he received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine for Covid 19. That day he felt fine. The following day he had some muscle aches. Sunday he states he had some slight shortness of breath, only for that day. Then he had some fever and chills feeling. That resolved. The only symptoms that persisted was his muscle aching and tightness. Then yesterday, the day of his presentation to the ER, he noted some bilateral lower extremity edema which prompted his visit. He is feeling mostly fine except a bit of muscle tightness. BNP was 154. Chest x-ray showed pneumonitis. He received antibiotics. Echocardiogram was completed showing preliminary findings of small to moderate pericardial effusion and trace aortic insufficiency.  Will treat with colchicine and ibuprofen.

                                                JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE EUA  I received the vaccine on 3rd April, 2021, at approximately 9:30 am. There were no immediate side effects. Approximately 10 hours later I began to feel EXTREME cold and chills. So much so that I had to put on 3 layers of clothing, socks and cover myself with 3-4 blankets. I also experienced a fever and body soreness. My wife tended to me with two ibuprofen tablets, 200 mg each and continually to put cold presses on my forehead. I drank a lot of water but my fever continued to spike to 102.8. The symptoms continued for another 3 hours. Out of concern we called the emergency room to ask if we should be concerned about the fever. We were advised to take two Tylenol tablets. My wife gave me two Tylenol PM tablets. About 30 mins after taking the Tylenol tablets and continuing to hydrate, my cold and chills began to subside and I began to shed all of my layers. About 30 minutes after that, my fever levelled out to abougt 100.8. Then I passed out. The following morning, I woke up with cold, chills and fever gone. I had a mild headache and took 2 Extra Strength Tylenol tablets. It&#39;s been four hours since then and I feel fine, just a little weak.

                                                Starting at 11 PM (roughly 7 hours after injection), I developed severe flu-like symptoms.  Fever, nausea, chills, and headache.  I was unable to sleep for most of the night.  I had a fever of over 100 degrees.  The symptoms were the worst from 11 PM - 4 AM.  They persisted throughout the next day (thus far), but have lessened in severity.  They are still present, however, 28 hours after initial injection - although roughly 50% less severe.  Acetaminophen seems to help.

When I went out to assess patient I found him laying back in chair with his head back, shaking, eyes open, and making fists with his hands. I asked him if he wanted me to call 911. He was able to respnd through clenched teeth that he felt very strange and to call 911. He remained conscious and knew his name. We contacted 911 and I supported pt from opposite side of wife. After a few minutes he calmed down and asked for water, he appeared to be sweating around head area. He took a few sips of water until operator on phone asked us to withhold further liquid until EMTS arrived. He was completely back to normal status within 5 minutes, EMTS came and assessed pt and allowed him to leave of his own accord. After the incident her relayed that similar reactions including full fainting spells have occurred to him in the past when receiving vaccines. this was not indicated on his intake form

Once there he started to read the provided material (EUA, V-Safe) and started to feel anxious.  He said the next thing he knew he was sweating and had tunnel vision.  He wasn&#39;t 100% sure he passed out.  A fellow associate helped him to the ground and elevated his feet.  We got ice for behind his neck, and a cold cloth for his forehead.  We took his blood pressure and it started to come back up.  He waited for about 30 minutes before leaving.  His color had returned and he stated he felt fine.

                                                Sudden onset of extreme chills, shivering uncontrollably until approximately 5am. This was accompanied by a severe headache and sore muscles. By about 10am the shivering/chills had subsided enough to be able to get out of bed and get Tylenol for the headache. This helped get some sleep. At about 1pm was the first time I checked my temperature and it read 102 orally. By this point the sore muscles had mostly subsided, but the headache and fever persisted until almost 11pm on the dot. The fever dropped from 102 to normal in under an hour.

Started with shortness of breath and asthma exacerbation symptoms on 4/1/21; saw PCP, on 4/2/21 for shortness of breath and asthma/allergy-like symptoms. He also reports that since the time of his vaccine his BP has been running slightly high around 140/85 and headaches have continued off and on. He was started on Budenoside inhaler by PCP and prednisone (patient does not recall dose). Came to see me at on-site clinic on 4/13/21 for continued headaches and concerns to blood pressure elevation persistence

                                                I woke up 7 days after receiving the vaccine with shooting sharp pains across my abdominal / midsection. While attempting to go to the bathroom, I must have passed out because I woke up some time later on the floor with a busted face and nose, and a severe headache.  Initially the day after the shot, I had sharp shooting pains down my right leg. I have also had a headache on more days since getting the vaccine.  Mental fog and tiredness is also occurring a few days after the initial shot.

                                                The evening after the shot, I felt common side effects like headache, lack of energy, weakness, fever, chills, body aches, and inflammation. But my skin was also very sensitive to the touch. Upon 100% recovery from the common side effects on Monday, April 19, my skin sensitivity went away but was replaced with intense itchiness that has continued and gotten more intense since then to this day (Wed.). I am developing a few small welts on hands and feet. So far, my symptoms are very mild and not alarming, but are noticeable and bothersome. I do hope they will go away soon. I thought you should know about the skin issue since I have not seen it reported anywhere this far after the shot.

Blurring peripheral in nature. Patient denied nausea, dizziness, no  antecedent trauma. He reported no occupational exposure history nor migraine  headache hx. Location of pain was the top of the head, intensity is 6/10, he had  taken no medications to ameliorate symptoms nor had he endorsed any antecedent  drug tobacco or alcohol use. Patient noted that he received the johnson and  johnson covid 19 vaccine 4/7/21 (vaccine was not received from the specific facility). ER  physician followed up with patient day after presenting to ED today, and patient  reported he was doing well. ER presentation may represent a simple tension type  headache given his single episode, relief with NSAID and the location that the  patient described the pain.

                                                The night of the 9th, I had injection site pain. That lasted for three days, at least. Significant pain but it didn&#39;t stop  me from work. It wasn&#39;t consistent pain - I was having trouble getting my arm up. Thursday, - 18th - I suddenly felt tired and feverish. I did a PCR test on the evening of the 18th. Then there was fever between 98.9 - 100.4. I had cough and sore throat and I had runny nose. The fever kind of subsided after I took Tylenol on the 18th and then again 19th and 20th, as well. My COVID result was negative. I made an emergency report on the 19th with my doctor. I had a virtual appt with her. She was under the opinion that it was a bacterial infection or allergic reaction. When I took - Levocedrizine - my runny nose symptoms got a little better. On 19th, she prescribed me Erythromycin - I took the full course. of that and my fever left the Sunday after I started that. I finished the full course of it by Tuesday. I still had a cough but I did not have any other symptoms after the course of medication (five days- I took two the first day and then one of the next four days after that) was finished. Note: I use CPAP at night. My cough took some time to subside - it probably subsided by the 26th.

Left side of face was left numb. I quickly did a neuro check; I could move fingers, eyes, etc. I called nurse and told to go to the ER.  At the ER, Covid test; neg, CT scan, MRI, blood work; all normal. Something happened to the nerve on that side of my face, trigeminal nerve.  It took a couple days for the numbness to dissipate. But I do still have some pain on the L side of my face.  Told to follow up with PCM; scheduled for 429/2021

                                                Approximately 10 hours after the vaccine my son started to feel shaky and very cold. He laid in bed to try and keep warm and I decided to take his temperature. It was 104.3. F. He didn&#39;t feel to sick just cold and tired. He&#39;s not the complaining type at all. I took his temperature at half hour intervals and at one point it reached 106.3 F. I called the hospital ER and asked if we should bring him in. They said since he wasn&#39;t feeling too too badly to just give him Tylenol. For the next few hours until about 2:30 A.M. his fever fluctuated between 104-105.8. It broke at that point down to 99 degrees F. He woke up this morning feeling OK but just tired. I and my husband both tracked our temperatures so we would know our thermometer is accurate, and we both consistently showed 97 and 98 degrees which is our normal temperature.

                                                After receiving the J&amp;J Covid vaccine I was awake all night with fever and chills, which I understand is completely normal.  However the next day my upper lip and lower nose swole up in an allergic reaction.  I took Benadryl and went to sleep and by the time I work up it had subsided.  Two days after that incident I woke up (this morning) and my left cheek was swollen from another allergic reaction.  During this time I had not eaten or taken anything out of the ordinary.

Severity slowly lessened the next day, by evening June 2 it was at the steady state level it is still at now, 2 weeks later. It&#39;s extremely distracting and reduces my ability to focus or think clearly. I have a purely thinking job and this is an extremely disruptive and productivity reducing level of sound.  Related but not what is being reported: Fever of 103F from about 7pm (6 hours after injection) to early morning. Down to 101F by 8am. 400mg ibuprofen taken at 9pm.  I&#39;ve never had any negative reaction to any other vaccine before.

He was given Cetirizine 10mg along w/ Pepcid 10 mg , but avoided benadryl d/t h/o severe sedation and wanted to keep him alert during the observation period.   After 2 hrs of observation, he was feeling much better and all vitals were normal.  However, he still c/o some discomfort w/ his throat, so another 0.3mg of Epinephrine was injected using an auto injector.   He continued to recover and after another 2 hrs of observation, he was allowed to go home w/ his wife for close monitoring.  He was called 1 hr later and confirmed that he continue to do well.  He was advised to take 25 mg of Benadryl before going to bed.  He was seen the following day and was back to normal.

                                                After about 3 days of flu like symptoms the flue like symptoms began to decline however late in the night, roughly 2am  wednesday night/thursday morning, I woke up with a high pitched squealing in my left ear.  The pitch started at 9,000Hz.  After about 2 weeks I saw my family physician where I was prescribed corticosteroids orally.  That slightly diminished the high pitch and changed it to more of a oscillating frequency however once one the steroids were complete the pitch continued to get worse and back to original levels.  I went back again about 4 weeks later and was prescribed a second dose.  Same outcome occurred.  I then went to a ENT and was prescribed a different corticosteroid and again same outcome occurred.  The frequency is so bad I can&#39;t sleep, read, and can barely do my job.  Besides the tinnitus their is consistent pressure on my left ear and ear popping every time I swallow.  I have taken Zyrtec-D however this only mildly works for the pressure.  Although the pressure is consistently there it varies in intensity.  This has been one of the worse experiences of my life and I hope the matter is taken seriously as both physicians correlate the occurrence with the vaccine but are unsure why it&#39;s happening.

Lifted him out and placed on floor, he was unresponsive - called 911, he came to slightly after 3 minutes.  Ambulance took him to ER and we stayed all day receiving fluids and chest XR (clear).  We were discharged in the afternoon with the doctor saying he has a syncopy episode.  At 4:00 PM PT was going to the bathroom and he stated he didn&#39;t feel good.  I stood in front of him because he turned white and eye rolled up into his head and he blacked out and stopped breathing for approximately 2 minutes while I got him on floor and gave CPR.  Called 911 and he began breathing again .  Back in ambulance to hospital and we stayed in hospital for 2 days.

The aches and chills without Advil lasted for 2 nights. For a while I was fine but on 04/29/2021 I was having sharp pains in my gut that kept coming and going. I googled it and I thought it was my colitis or a blood clot. I went to the ER they did an CAT scan in my gut and they said it was definitely ulcerative colitis, which I have had for  years but without any flare ups for 21 years. They sent me to a GI doctor and they did a colonoscopy. They confirmed that it was colitis but not that severe and that I should be fine. After that I have been doing ok. I have had like two incidents since then but not as bad as the time I had to go to the ER.

                                                About 9 hours after receiving the vaccine I began developing flu-like symptoms, which quickly escalated. Within a couple of hours I developed a very high fever (which peaked at 104.1 and hovered around 102-103), body-wracking cold chills, extreme lethargy and body aches. The only thing that kept my fever down was 1,000mg of Tylenol every 6 hours, with a cold compress on my head. The symptoms were less severe but still substantial by the following day. On the second night after receiving the vaccine (Monday the 8th) I had nightsweats, but then woke up on the morning of Tuesday the 9th feeling almost completely back to normal. The only other strange thing to happen was waking up today on Thursday the 11th with a giant fever blister on my lip, which I suppose could be attributed to an immune system in temporary disarray or overdrive. I am still very grateful for the vaccine and would do it again, but it was very scary that first night on Sunday the 7th. I don&#39;t remember the last time I felt that sick.

                                                On Saturday 3/20 I experienced the usual symptoms that were noted. On Monday 3/22 I began to get very dizzy with a heart rate of 150bpm. My blood pressure went up to 210/138 which is extremely abnormal for me. I began to tremor uncontrollably. I thought it was an anxiety attack so I took my Xanax. .50mg. That did not work at all. I experienced nausea and stomach pain. I called 911 and was taken to the hospital where after 4 hours I started feeling better. Tuesday I continued to have tremors. Wednesday the rapid heart rate, stomach pain, and nausea returned. The rest of the week did not get any better. On Saturday 3/27 I slept all day long which again is not normal for me at all. At this point we are 1 full week into the vaccine administration. On Sunday 3/28 I bagan to have the same feeling as the prior Tuesday. Sweating, couldn&#39;t breath, heart rate hit 170 this time. BP was the same, tremors, stomach pain, nausea, dizzyness, and this time my Carbon Dioxide level dropped to 24. This morning 3/29 I woke up with extreme tremors. No dizzyness.

                                                I began having cold chills in the evening about 6-7 hours after I got my vaccine shot. Got a headache soon after. Woke up the next day with a migraine headache, feeling very woozy and running a fever.  Had to call off work to recover from flu-like symptoms.

Pt then laid back in the chair and became unresponsive, but still conscious. Pharmacy team, moved patient to the floor, where he immediately became responsive and color came back to skin. It is noted that the patient was sweating at the time of the event, and he stated he does not do well with shots. All of this took place within 15 minutes of receiving the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine.

The chills grew to be severe by about 8 hours post-vaccine and I had a fever of 100.5F.  Fever eventually got to 101.0 F with severe chills.  My fever and chills subsided about 18 hours post-vaccine and was replaced with moderate-to-severe headache.  I took 500 mg Tylenol and headache subsided.  I am now 24 hours post-vaccine and feel only mild lethargy but otherwise good.  A rough few hours but happy to have the vaccine!

At 1:30am, I woke up needing to urinate. I went into the bathroom and lost consciousness, finding myself with one hand in the toilet and one on the side. I felt nauseous and thought I would vomit, but didn&#39;t and believe I lost consciousness again. I was able to make it to the sink to try to wash my hands, and I fell down on my knees.

When I awoke I was still sweating and cold for the next five to ten minutes.  Paramedics checked my vital signs onsite afterwards (blood pressure, sugar levels, and pulse) and everything appeared to be normal.  I was able to drive home 30 minutes later after making sure that all side effects subsided.  I have not experienced any other side effects from the vaccine.

                                                The evening after I received my vaccine I became very cold and couldn&#39;t get warm, to the point of shivering very hard, while at the same time having a fever of 102 F (about 9:30 pm).  The house was 68 F, and I bundled up with thermal underwear, fleece pajamas, a robe, and two extra blankets, but I couldn&#39;t stop feeling cold.  My body was painfully sore the rest of the night; this may have been a reaction from shivering so hard and wearing my muscles out.  Later that night, I woke up in a sweat (maybe 11:30pm) and had to strip out of my clothes down to my underwear, and I couldn&#39;t stop feeling warm.  I slept the rest of the night on top of the covers, and woke up very frequently, probably every half hour.  Each time I woke, I drank half a glass of water (about 6 oz).  The next day my fever was gone and I felt normal temperature wise, but my muscles were all very sore.  I had flu-like symptoms for about a week, a little bit less each day.  It was probably a full week later until I felt normal.

                                                Hi I was vaccinated Thursday April 8th 2021 at approximately 9:15am. I kept a log so I could share my experience with my friends and family. After vaccination I was fine for a few hours but I randomly got a case of  watery eyes that would last about 15 minutes and then clear up. This happened 4 times over a 9 hour period. Around 9 hours after vaccination I started to feel like I had a cold and my skin all over my body ached to touch and my heart started racing. I felt sunburned and nauseous and went to bed. 13 hours exactly after vaccination I was hit hard with intense chills to the point of teeth chattering and full body shivering. 15 hours after injection I woke up intensely hot and I had a massive headache, full body pain, a tickle deep in my lungs that made me cough, nausea, and a fever of 101. I also was having extreme heart palpitations. I have a laser thermometer and I discovered my fever was 101.5 at my forehead but my neck and chest were 103. I took ibuprofen and kept patting myself with cold wet wash cloths to combat the fever. At this point I debated going to the hospital. I had intense fatigue and I was too weak to move but too sick to sleep. This level of fever and symptoms went on for about a day and a half. Since my vaccination I am still fatigued, I get winded very easily, something small like feeding my dog makes me break out in a sweat, and I need to lay down. I am still weak and fatigued but not to the same level as before and it changes every day. I have a sore throat, headaches, occasionally my body will twitch in random places, fever will pop up and go away, I cough gag and get very weak under any physical stress. I did not have injection site pain out of the ordinary until 48 hours after injection and it felt like a shotgun blast to the arm.. I did have very unusual joint pain from the start. I was injected in my upper left arm, but my lower right ankle was painful and my left wrist...    I am a 38 year old male with treated hypertension, obesity and sleep apnea. My mother who is 65 was vaccinated at the same time as myself and her symptoms were slow onset and much milder than mine but she too has headaches, upset stomach, fatigue, watery eyes, fever, chills, twitches, injection pain, etc.

I treated with OTC pain reliever OTC extra strength Tylenol 500MG x 2. Repeated this approx 6 hours later again taking 500MG x2. After 2 doses I felt good enough and discontinued taking anything beyond that.

                                                About 7 hours after the injection I woke up with intense chills.  I was awake for 6 hours in the night with intense chills, sweating, and a temperature of at least 102.  I was unable to take Tylenol until having the chills for 9 hours.  Tylenol helped.  I slept about 20 hours the first day with a fever all day.  I had a fever for about 24 hours.  The following week I was completely exhausted and slept about 12 hours a day.  I am 38 years old and this was the sickest I have been in probably 20 years.  It was bad and that&#39;s why I am reporting it.  I am very thankful to have had the vaccine though.  Thank you all for what you do!

Then, on Monday April 12, 2021, I went to the gym where I worked out. When I came home and after showering, I returned a phone call shortly after 8 P.M. While speaking on the phone, I could tell after a few minutes of talking something was off, and then all of a sudden, the words stopped coming out. After a few more seconds, I was trying to yell upstairs to my wife for help. I sounded like a goat while trying to yell that word. I then snapped out of it, and was able to speak clearly and normal again. I told my wife and called back my friend. My friend said I sounded like I was getting sick when I had the attack. The next morning I went to the hospital. I was diagnosed with a Transient Ischemic Attack &#34;TIA.&#34;

About a day or two later, I developed a chronic cough that is still currently persisting.  After seeing my doctor on Sat 4/17, I was prescribed an Albuterol inhaler for asthma, which has been dormant for years.   The coughing is continuous, and at times strong/violent.  On the morning of Tues 4/20 I had coughed up a little bit of blood after the coughing had persisted for about 5 or 10 minutes.  Asthma, chronic cough, and  coughing up blood are not typical/documented side effects of received the Covid vaccine.  My asthma has been dormant for years, and prior to this event, I have not had instances of chronic cough or coughing up blood.

The next morning, I felt very tired walking up stairs from the basement to my room on the 2nd floor..barely made it to the 2nd floor, felt like my body hitting a wall/ no energy to lift my legs up. I made to my bedroom but felt very dizzy, using my hands holding myself up on my desk and realized I might faint any seconds..my vision was bright and blurry. I slowly moved myself to a bed and laid down for a while. Later that day in the late afternoon, my muscles were sore (legs, thighs, back) I could not walk more than 10-15 steps which I needed rest. These conditions lasted me for 6 days since receiving the vaccine and felt better on the 7th day. Currently I&#39;m ok.

I retire around 12-1 a.m. and consistently awake between 4 and 6 a.m., unable to fall back asleep. This has led to serious drowsiness during the day. Prior to the vaccine, I would regularly sleep until 8 or 9 a.m.  uninterrupted.

                                                I had a severe headache starting in the evening. The pain was constant, dull, and felt like it was coming from the center of the head. I don&#39;t have a history of headaches, so this was unusual. After going to bed at 11PM, I woke up around 2AM from the intense pain. I could not sleep for a couple of hours in the night and I took Nyquil, which helped a little bit. I considered going to the emergency room, but decided to wait until morning to make the decision. I was able to go back to sleep and then slept until 11AM. I woke up feeling weak and groggy, although it may have been due to the Nyquil. The headache was improved and gradually diminished throughout the day. The next morning, it was completely gone and I felt back to normal.

                                                On 04-16-2021 I experienced I could feel tingling sensation on my let arm and face, lasting couple of hours. Earlier that night, I woke up I was cold, my temperature was 99.F.  For the rest of the week of Friday morning wok up with headaches, focused at temple, left side of my head. I still had some tingling to my left arm radiating to my left pinky finger. My tingling sensation and headaches come and go and come back again on and off.  I went to see a physician 04-23-2021 and did blood work which was negative. On 04-28-2021 I saw a neurologist on 04-28-2021. I have had this tingling sensation to my body before due to a parasite, previous history. She states that it sounded that the vaccine caused a flare up t my body and recommend treatment steroid injections to my temples and neck. She states this injections work about 70% of the time. She also prescribed muscle relaxer and take Vitamin D complex. Herdiagnosis was related to nerve damage due to the flare up.

I could not get warm.  My body would go from hot to cold and shiver/spasm in a pattern that lasted about a minute or so.  this pattern of hot cold and shiver/spasm lasted approximately an hour.    when that subsided I started to experience relatively extreme fever and flu symptoms.  I completely sweat through my pajamas.  My entire body ached and hurt like a normal fever flu but more extreme.  Around 2:30AM I took three 500mg acetaminophen, 2 mg Xanax and a 10 mg Valium.  I fell back asleep some time between 3:30 and 4:00AM.  I woke up at 8:30 with most of the symptoms having dissipated.  It&#39;s now 10AM.  I still feel groggy and a little achy in my body, but the fever seems to have subsided.  For now that is about it

                                                Patient received vaccine and immediately felt light-headed and faint. He turned white upon standing and sat back down. He continued to have labored breathing and starting sweating. We were monitoring him and he informed us that it was anxiety related. He couldn&#39;t move his hands and started blacking out. When EMT arrived he started to feel better. They were able to rule out an allergic reaction and it was most likely anxiety related. Patient refused to go to the hospital and was walked out by EMT to make sure he could drive home.

On Sat, May 1, I had an afib episode in the morning. Reset to sinus rhythm the next morning around 2:30am. I spoke with you during the episode.   3. On Mon, May 3, I had brain fog. I?m usually tired after an afib episode. But this seemed different. I?ve never experienced something like this before. But I chalked it out to the after effects of the afib and moved on. 4. On Fri, May 7, I started having the stiffness in my right calf. I checked in with you that weekend to make sure it wasn?t a clot. After we spoke I think we ruled out a clot.  5. In addition, I?ve developed some added symptoms since then: (i) Sweaty feet. (ii) Pins and needles sensation in feet.  (iii) Tightness in the arch of the right foot. (iv) Feet and hands feel sensitive to cold.  (v) Burning sensation in feet and left hand.  (vi) Mild headache mostly felt in the left temple.  (vii) A pulling feeling on the left side of the face. (viii) A feeling that if I close my eyes, I may faint.

                                                Ever since the shot, that night - severe chills, fever. A week later, I went to ER - I was still having short term memory loss, chest pain and body aches and joint pains I have been scheduled for a Rheumatologist; Neurologist.  I&#39;m still taking prednisone until I can get to the Rheumatologist. As long as I&#39;m on the prednisone, I&#39;m all right but as soon as I come off it I get symptoms back of pressure in my head, all my joints start hurting and have short term memory loss.

Patient sat in immunization booth for a total of 35 minutes and was given something to eat and drink, as he had nothing to eat yet for the day and only had caffeine and nicotine in his system.  Patient started to feel less shaky but was still light headed.  It was suggested we call the paramedics for evaluation and he refused, and then left the pharmacy 35 minutes after vaccine (against pharmacist advise).  The patient called approximately 2 hours later and said he was feeling better, no longer shaky or light headed and had a headache as the only symptom at the time.

                                                I administered a Janssen covid imz to patient at 1:07pm. Immediately following the patient proceeded to faint, his head fell back and limps went limp. I called for pharmacist  to come into the immunization room for assistance and bring an ice pack. She ran into the room to help. At this time 1:08pm the patient began to shake and had what appeared to be a seizure. I dialed 911 and pharmacist was helping patient and protected his head. After shaking for about 10 seconds, the patient stopped. He then awoke, jumped awake confused and scared. We sat patient down and monitored him. At this time the pharmacy tech called management. After patient was calm and sitting, we called his wife into the room. Management arrived in pharmacy. At 1:12pm patient felt cold and clammy.  He said he very much had to use the restroom. With assistance, he used the pharmacy bathroom. EMT arrived at 1:16pm. EMT determined low blood pressure. Patient had worked outside all morning in heat and was likely under hydrated. Over the next few minutes, EMT determined the patient&#39;s blood pressure was increasing. At 1:22pm, patient declined to go to the hospital. EMT signed off and left. Patient remained in room until about 1:40 with his wife to rest. Management got him candy and a fan to help. His wife and management then took him to their car.

                                                I work as a security officer for a multi-story office building. About a week after receiving the vaccine I began having a pain in my hip. Normally, my job requires me to walk between 2-4 miles per shift, and I?ve never had problems doing so. But since the vaccine I?ve only been able to walk for about 30 minutes before needing to sit and rest; the pain becomes unbearable. It doesn?t feel like a backache. It feels like a sharp stabbing sensation in my hip/thigh joint when I&#39;m standing or walking. OTC aspirin and IB have had no effect and the problem hasn?t subdued. A dull pain is always there, even at home and when I&#39;m sleeping, but it becomes a major issue at work because of the constant walking. I?m unsure if it?s vaccine related.

Client&#39;s vital signs taken at 1553 and were BP 148/90, P 99, O2 97% and R 16. Client was given some water and animal crackers. Client was encouraged to drink fluids and stay hydrated. Client continued to report having nausea, dizziness, and a headache. Blood pressure was reassessed at 1610 and was 178/100. PHN questioned if client had high blood pressure and client reported, &#34;It runs in my family.&#34; PHN educated client that his BP was quite elevated, and PHN explained that a diastolic BP of 100 usually occurs over time. PHN advised client to go to walk in if his symptoms do not improve, but PHN strongly recommended client follow up with his primary care provider in regards to his elevated blood pressure. Client told PHN that he would most likely go to the walk in. Client verbalized understanding. Client left clinic with his wife who was giving him a ride. On 6/18/2021 at 1014 PHN placed call to client to see how client was feeling today. Call went straight to voicemail. PHN requested call back.

                                                BEFORE GIVING THE JANSSEN COVID VACCINE (LOT # 1805025 EXP 5/25/21), THE PATIENT HAD STATED THAT THE LAST FEW TIMES HE GOT A SHOT OR HAD A BLOOD DRAW HE GOT REALLY SICK AND EVEN PASSED OUT. THE VACCINE WAS GIVEN WITHOUT INCIDENT AND PATIENT SAID HE FELT OK. HE TRADED PLACES WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AND SAT IN A CHAIR IN THE EXAM ROOM. IT WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER I HAD ALREADY GIVEN HIS GIRLFRIEND HER VACCINE THAT HE SAID THAT HE WAS FEELING FUNNY. HIS COLORING CHANGED AND HE WAS DIAPHORETIC. I GOT A PAPERTOWEL WITH COOL WATER ON IT AND PLACED ON HIS NECK AND ANOTHER ONE FOR HIS FOREHEAD. AFTER A MINUTE OR SO, HE DID PASS OUT WHILE IN THE CHAIR. HE WAS OUT FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS AND THEN CAME BACK TO AND WAS ALERT AND ORIENTED X 4 BUT STILL FELT VERY WEAK. I GAVE HIM A WATER TO SIP ON. HIS GIRLFRIEND STAYED AT HIS SIDE THE WHOLE TIME. HIS O2 WAS 100% AND HIS PULSE 53. HE SAID THAT HE HAD EATEN SHORTLY BEFORE COMING TO GET HIS VACCINE BUT THEN LATER ASKED FOR AN APPLE BECAUSE HE WAS ON A CLEANSE DIET AND REALLY HAD NOT EATTEN MUCH. THE PCT WENT TO GET HIM AN APPLE. AFTER EATING THE APPLE AND SITTING FOR AN ADDITIONAL 20 MIN HE FELT WELL ENOUGH TO LEAVE. STILL WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AND HIS GIRLFRIEND COMMITTED TO DRIVING HIM SO HE DID NOT HAVE TO. HE LEFT WITH NO ASSISTANCE.

                                                The night of 3/23/21 at 5pm I had chills in my Brady and numbness and tingling in my toes. I looked at my toes and noticed they were turning very pale.  One minute later the bottoms of my feet started turning yellow and within one more minute the bottoms of my feet souls were completely yellow. I have never had this reaction before. It was shocking and looked like I had stepped in yellow paint.

                                                Pt had history of anaphylaxis related to bee stings. We asked if he had ever had a reaction to another vaccine and he said no. Pt came up saying he wasn&#39;t feeling well during the observation period, within about 5-10 minutes after receiving the vaccination. He look very pale and clammy. I asked if he was ok and he shook his head. Tried to grab a chair for him and he started to collapse. With some help I was able to get him to the ground without injury. We called 911 and I grabbed an epipen. I tried to assess the patient, and he was unable to tell me if he was having any trouble breathing or if his lips/mouth/tongue was swelling. He was conscious but couldn&#39;t speak coherently. I administered the epipen to his right lateral thigh due to his history of anaphylaxis with bee stings. We were able to lay him down while waiting for the ambulance. His color started to return and he was able to respond to questions, but was still slightly confused. He did tell me at this point that he has had similar reactions after vaccines and blood work. The paramedics arrived and took the patients vitals and took him to the hospital.

Went away after 24 hours. The second began with profound feelings of mania 2 days later (Monday, March 8). This subsided in 24 hours. 4 days later- (Wednesday March 10) I began having difficulty standing upright.  This steadily became worse over the next several days until one week after the vaccination, where I was hugging walls and crawling on the floor to move from place to place.   This continued until Monday, March 15, when I was hospitalized.  Everything cleared up after 3 days in the hospital.

                                                10 hours after my shot I had moderate to severe chills with pains that moved around my body. Pain would go from deep pain in my leg, to hands, to feet.  Not ache like the flu, but piercing pain.  Head ache as well. This first round lasted for 1 hour and 36 minutes.  Then, a break for almost two hours. Following that break, the next 12 hours i was achy throughout my body, headache that would come and go and very fatigued.  I was only able to get out of bed for roughly 2 hours during that 12 hour stretch. Following this I ended up getting a fever later that night that lasted for about 2 hours (100.5 at the highest).    Since that night I have had pain daily throughout my body.  They are quick, sometime sharp pains in my head, and various muscles throughout my body. I have also had deep pains as well that have come and go in random muscles in my body.

                                                Within a few minutes of receiving the vaccination I lost consciousness. It was a drive-through vaccination clinic by the Health department. My vehicle rolled into a cement and metal bar/side of the building&#39;s exit at a slow speed. The EMS at the scene stated that my heartbeat was irregular, varying between bradycardia and tachycardia. When they checked my blood pressure inside the ambulance they stated it was very low. About 15-20 minutes later I tried to sit up and was still unstable and unable to keep myself upright without assistance. I was then taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital&#39;s emergency department. Nothing notable or unusual was found when I was checked out there. Within a couple hours I felt well enough to go home. Once home I had a headache, fatigue, mild dizziness, and nausea with physical activity. The following day I had a headache, muscle aches, pain at the injection site, and nausea with extended physical activity. Today I have pain in the arm where I received the vaccine and a mild headache.

The achiness is fading (in line to how I&#39;ve felt after Tetanus shots in the past).

At around 2am April 11 I went to use the bathroom and blacked out. My wife found me on the floor and was able to rouse me. Went to the ER with severe stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea, severe headache, fever, high pulse of 120-140bpm. Pulse dropped to 108bpm by the time i got to te hospital. Hospital administered Zofran for my gastro issues and ran an EKG. We waited 3&#43; hours and never saw a doctor and was never even taken back in the ER. We left due to staff and patients in the waiting room not wearing respirators or masks or even basic sanitary precautions or separation of patients with Covid symptoms from other patients.

About 20hrs after receiving the shot I started to run a low grade fever floating from 99.5-100.5F; I normally average around 97.5-98F. Thursday night/Friday morning I had the most prolonged fever break I&#39;ve ever had; my entire bed was soaked.  Fever was gone by Friday sunrise.   Saturday I experienced a sever headache, stomach ache and in the evening shortness of breath. I felt extremely light headed. All symptoms cleared by Sunday.   I just drank plenty of fluids and rested as much as possible.

                                                This was one of the worst headaches I&#39;ve ever had in my life. Migraine headaches run in my family so I&#39;m no stranger to them, which is why it is particularly surprising. Along with the headache I had severe flu symptoms - body ache from head to toe, legs toward the end. Abdominal pain toward end. I was breathing heavily throughout, except for an hour or two of bad sleep. It was almost certainly a high fever, but I didn&#39;t measure. Chills, sweating. Complete misery. The extremely painful cycle lasted about 10 hours before it started to recede. I felt better close to 100% within 48 hours. I&#39;m reporting this because I&#39;ve realized that most people have &#34;mild flu like symptoms&#34; while my symptoms were extreme. If I had any other health issues (I don&#39;t) it seems obvious that it could have created a bigger problem. I didn&#39;t go to a hospital, but I should have, in hindsight.

Some leg pain was noticed the 2nd or 3rd day. And I have experienced ear ringing randomly about a week and a half after vaccination. Those may or may not be related.  Also I feel it important to note in March of 2020 (before testing was available) I experienced a very similar set of symptoms: fever, chills, fatigue, multi-day headache, body ache, 6 weeks of slight cough, leg pain, and a day a few weeks after the coughing started where I had shortness of breath. I wasn&#39;t tested back then as it was not available. But based on the symptoms I experienced, I truly believe I had COVID-19 last year prior to vaccination.

                                                I have had headaches every day since I received the vaccination that last most of the day. There is a constant pressure in my head that moves around all areas, from the back base of the head, to the sides, temples, forehead/sinus regions. It is from waking until sleeping. Not incredibly intense, but constant. I have difficulty sleeping through the night and have not slept well since, either. I have also experience blurred vision. I have also experience bruising on various parts of my body including my arm, abdomen, and toe nails. My quality of life has suffered tremendously and I wish I hadn&#39;t gotten the vaccine.

Couldn&#39;t get up for work the next two days - extreme fatigue. It was a little better on Saturday and by Sunday it felt like I was getting my energy back. IF I hadn&#39;t been working at home, I probably would have missed my Wednesday work day that first day.  I had at  Hospital Hemorrhoid Surgery (outpatient surgery) on the 22nd of April. My recovery had been going well for the first week or so but now I am having an issue with hard stools. I am taking liquids every  and I am having a bowel movement every day and I can&#39;t get them soft - they are all hard. I am taking  two stool softeners a day. and I&#39;m taking fiber. I am being impeded my recovery of my surgery - I&#39;m a week or two behind in recovery because of this.

                                                I went to bed just fine on the night of the vaccine. Woke up two hours later with extreme shortness of breath, sweating and hot flashes. Symptoms eventually disappeared within 48 hours. But they returned on June 20th, though more mildly. Mainly whenever I puff my cigarette, I start feeling a lack of breath -- not being able to  breath deeply and fully. If I keep puffing, I eventually start having hot flashes and chest pain. It&#39;s very bizarre, because I&#39;ve been puffing 10&#43; years with no problems.
