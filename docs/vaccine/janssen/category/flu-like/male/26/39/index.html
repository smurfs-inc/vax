                                                Friday night at about 10ish I suddenly got a terrible migraine, shaking uncontrollably, and my body have stiff. I tried going to bed at 11pm, but couldn&#39;t fall asleep. I got up sometime around 2am and I still had all of these along with extreme nausea. Check my temperature, it was 101.4 F. Got more blankets and tried to get some sleep, but took a while due to the migraine.   At 7:30am, the shaking was gone and the migraine was not as bad, but I still had a temperature of 99.1 F and nausea. After calling my boss and mother, I went back to sleep. Stayed in bed until about 1:45pm Saturday. By then, the migraine was manageable and nausea was not as bad, though still had a temperature of 99.9 F. Took a shower and took 2 pills of  ibuprofen.

                                                I received the vaccine at 4:20 PM on Friday (3/12).  I had no adverse effects until after I fell asleep.  I woke up at 2:00 AM with a fever, body aches, headache, and severe nausea.  I proceeded to vomit until 6:00 AM.  The following day (3/13) included mild headache, mild body aches, and slight nausea.  By Sunday (3/14), all negative symptoms had gone away.

Took a hot shower and relaxed before bed time around 10pm started to have a headache. By 10:45 when I went to sleep it was an intense headache. Under the covers my body was incredibly hot, without covers I was freezing cold. I woke up around midnight in a sweat and again around 2:30am when I called in sick to work. I then sat in my bathroom for 30 minutes, threw up once, and then feeling much better (Still had an intense headache) I drank some water and fell back asleep in my room. Today is the second day, I have a small headache, have not eaten all day, and slept most of the afternoon. I highly recommend not working out the same day of getting the vaccine, I didn&#39;t think to ask about that when I received it. I doubt I would have had this problem if I rested instead.

Hearing came back after 5 minutes, but moderate body shakes began and lasted an hour. Got very cold feeling and began to feel fever like. Took acetaminophen and covered up with blankets and drank water. Took a couple hour nap and woke up sweating with terrible migraine and light body shakes. Fell asleep for a few more hours and woke up not feeling feverish, but migraine and body aches. 22 hours after onset I have a light headache and body aches and am mostly feeling recovered.

                                                Initial symptoms of visual impairment, later diagnosed as visual snow, occurred on Sunday 3/28 along with a headache. Assumed it was a migraine, but after it continued on Monday 3/29 I called advise nurse and scheduled exams for my eyes. The eye doctor confirmed it seems to be experiencing symptoms of visual snow. My vision is currently still looks like static. It has not gone away.  Google search showed potential side effect of astrazeca vaccine in their report so am assuming it is also a side effect of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine as this occurred as a result of receiving it.  I never had this before.

After awaking he doesn&#39;t remember the last 5 minutes. He laid down to go to sleep and was consistently hot and then cold. He does have a history of night terrors but they have remained dormant for about 2.5 years. Around 12 am he started having one of the worst night terrors I&#39;ve seen. The following morning, April 2nd 2021, he was feeling incredibly sore and the injection spot was tender. He said &#34;it feels like I got hit by a truck.&#34; Seems to be doing okay otherwise now.

                                                Patient came in for vaccine. After vaccination, I had patient sit in a chair in case of any adverse reactions. About 5 minutes after vaccination, another patient came over and said that was not feeling well. When going out to patient I noticed he was very pale and sweating.  The patient then proceeded to pass out. I was able to hold the patients head and the other customer was able to hold his shoulders to make sure he did not fall out of the chair. The patient then got very stiff and proceeded to push back in his chair, after about 10 seconds he relaxed. The patient was passed out for about 3 mins, during that time I was able to remove his mask and hold his head. After gaining consciousness, I was able to make sure he was ok. We were able to give him some water and he stated he felt better. I asked the patient to stay for another half hour to monitor. After giving the patient another bottle of water, and having him sit he was able to get up and leave.

I went back and checked on him after 5mins of waiting, then came back to the pharmacy. But heard a big bang shortly after. Some how, he had fallen out of his chair and bumped his head and neck on an end camp. He seemed a little confused, when I ran over, but was awake, a little sweaty and nauseated. EMS was called. They transported him to ER to have his head checked, since he bumped it.

Got up to use the bathroom around 5am. Upon finishing peeing while standing, I lost consciousness, falling. As a result of the fall, I fractured my cheek bone, cut open my ear, later requiring three stitches, and was concussed, resulting in a loss of memory. I was nonresponsive when my fiance found me immediately following the crash, and was rushed to the hospital  via ambulance. Upon arrival to the hospital, my fever was found to be 102 F. As a result of the fall, I have a cheek bone fracture, three stiches in my ear, and a concussion.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I received the Janssen vaccine in my upper-left arm at 3:00 PM on April 5, 2021, at a public health clinic (I think that&#39;s the proper term for the site) established in a mall. After about ten minutes, during the scheduled waiting period, I began to feel lightheaded; I can best compare the feeling to that of being tipsy after a glass or two of wine. I waited another twenty minutes at the site to see if the feeling worsened, and when it didn&#39;t, I left without telling anyone how I felt. During the drive home, however, I continued to feel lightheaded during the drive home and worried that it might be affecting my driving. After I got home without incident, the feeling persisted for a few hours and ceased that evening.  Since then, I have experienced nothing but what I think are standard post-vaccination symptoms (fatigue, muscle aches, slight brain fog, swollen lymph nodes?not unlike the sensations of recovering from a modest cold). I nevertheless want to report the lightheadedness because it appears (based on news reports) that it is an unusual reaction to the vaccine. I want to make sure that my experience is recorded, even though I do not believe that I require further medical attention.

Symptoms arose approximately 8 hours after vaccination (between midnight and 1 AM, 4/9/21) and persisted until approximately 5 AM, coinciding with sleeplessness. Throughout the entirety of the next day nausea, headache, and weakness persisted. After 36 hours, mostly bedridden, and 12 hours of sleep the following night symptoms have dissipated as of 10 AM 4/10/21.

After reaching my home even after few hours also I didnt have any symptoms. But before I went to sleep (around 12:30 am ), i started to have mild pain near the vaccination sight. Even during my sleep i felt okay, but as soon as I woke up (around 09:00 am) i felt mild symptoms on pain, as I started attending to my regular activties right after 10:00 am, i started to feel severe chills, fever,  body pains, lazyness, moderate headache and severe pain at vaccination site. Again I had some food and slept due to severe body pains and even through the sleep also I had severe body pains, fever, nausea and lazyness. As I woke up after my evening nap of 3 hours, i woke up at 6:00 pm and felt chills, body pains., fever and nausea.

About 5 minutes post-vaccine, the patient stated he was not feeling well and feeling warm and sweaty. The pharmacy staff provided the patient with water and an ice pack. The patient stated he was feeling faint. The patient fainted for about 20 seconds and then became conscious again. The patient didn&#39;t have any injuries and didn&#39;t fall down. The patient was okay and he laid down and elevated his feet on a chair. He then stated that he has severe needle phobia and has fainted several times in the past with vaccine administration and blood draws. He had experienced this in the past. He was still slightly faint and requested that he be checked out. The EMT arrived and they took his vitals and checked him. By the time the EMT arrived, he was beginning to feel better and had sat up and drinking water. There were no further issues. The EMT stated he was good to head home. We followed up with patient and the patient was feeling good with no further issues.

                                                I received the J&amp;J vaccine at 10:00am on March 18, 2021 at the Community Center. By about 5:00pm, I started to feel minor flu-like symptoms, but as the night progressed it got significantly worse. Around 8-9pm, I was bedridden with the worst chills/shaking I&#39;ve ever experienced in my life. Around 9:30-10:00pm, I was filling water at my sink and projectile vomitted multiple times into the sink and could not make it to the bathroom. Subsequently, I ate a bagel and drank lots of water, knowing my vomitting could make me dehydrated. Throughout the night, I was awake and shaking, and drank and filled my water bottle repeatedly. At 8:00am, I was filling my water, and without my knowledge of awareness, fainted on my kitchen floor, dropping the Brita filter and likely hitting my head. My roommate heard the commotion and saw me passed out in our kitchen. He tried to wake me up and I phased in, but then subsequently phased out again 20-30 seconds later as I was trying to stand and likely hit my head again. My roommate eventually got me over to our couch and called EMTs. Upon their arrival, EMTs checked my pulse, which was fine, and saw an open laceration on the back of my head, so they took me to Hospital to access the Trauma Center. On the way, I threw up repeatedly and was very lightheaded. Upon my arrival at Hospital, I was checked for any neck bone breaks, given an IV, a CT  scan, an EKG, and staples were placed in the back of my head to heal the laceration. After my release, I was bedridden for 2-3 days and required a daily nap during work (1-2) hours for the next 1 1/2 to 2 weeks. For a while, everything was fine, but recently during the first two weeks of April, it has become apparent that my head is foggy and reacts to changes in the weather, which leads me to believe that I likely banged my head pretty good when I fainted those two times.

                                                Initial adverse reaction was a headache and impaired vision. My vision has continued to be impaired with it being similar to static and has caused headaches.   After research I saw AstraZeneca had this in their files as a possible side effect. I understand it is different but made with similar technology so it may or may not be true for J&amp;J vaccine, but this has continued for almost a month so I am concerned.

I got up to get Advil and had a seizure. I have epilepsy, and had not missed a dose of my medication. My last seizure before this was 2 years ago. After recovering, taking Advil, taking a shower, and going back to sleep for about 4 more hours, I woke up feeling fine.

Fever was attenuated with extra strength Tylenol. Fever came back the following day with a max temperature of 101.5 (1pm on 3/27). Took Tylenol again and the temperature returned to normal (99.1). Temperature  rose to 100.2 the following day (2pm on 3/28) and returned to normal (98.6) after Tylenol. Throughout all of these events, there was stiffness in the upper arm where the vaccine was injected.

At around 2:30am, could barely walk into the front room. Just very slowly and painfully. Ended up in such a state that I absentmindedly urinated onnthe bathroom floor while pulling pant leg up to scratch an itch while urinating in toilet. Laying on back caused butt and thighs to hurt significantly more. Same for stomach. Getting up from and laying down on my floor mattress was and still is difficult.   Later into the morning at around 6:40am, had to crawl slowly on hands and knees to get back in the front room. By around 8am, I could walk around without it being unbearable. Just slow-ish. Ate breakfast, so stomach is more uncomfortable than in pain. Can lay on it without too much problem, but butt is still hurting. Stretching legs forward caused some pain.  Possible fever.

Fell back asleep and woke up with a horrible headache and migraine (primarily behind my eyes). Entire body ached and had a fever of 100.5. This lasted the entire next day after receiving the vaccine. The second day, the headache subsided but my neck and lymph nodes were swollen and very sore.

                                                6-7 hours after receiving, I got a headache, and became very tired &amp; achey all over. I took ibuprofen &amp; acetaminophen and felt reasonably better for a few hours. Then later that night (12-18 hours after vaccine) I became much sicker and was unable to sleep. I had a low fever, upset stomach, severe chills (couldn&#39;t stop shaking/shivering for over an hour) body aches, and an extremely bad headache. I continued to use ibuprofen and acetaminophen but even combined they weren&#39;t nearly enough to relieve my symptoms. Late into the night around 3-4am (15-16 hours after vaccine) nausea became the worst side effect, surpassing the headache. I eventually vomited around 4am, after which point the symptoms became more bearable and I managed to sleep a couple hours. Thursday/Friday (two days after vaccine) I still felt very weak, achey, and tired and had to call out of work both days. I was never again in the severe discomfort I experienced Wednesday night/Thursday morning, but I still felt a little tired, achey, and mildly sour stomach on days 3 &amp;4 (Saturday/Sunday). Monday morning I felt similarly tired &amp; achey, but I do feel essentially back to normal Monday night.

About 5-10 min later my heart rate became very fast very quickly and it became more difficult to breathe. I was driving home at the time, had to pull over and wait a few minutes until the event subsided. I debated contacting medical help, but i began recovering and was able to continue driving. Since the event i have been feeling slightly fatigued and i have a slight feverish feeling, but in general have been able to rest and have not had a repeat occurrence. I received no medical attention or treatment.

I went for a walk for about 40 mins started to feel worse. I had body aches throughout my back and chest and in both arms, was freezing. Tried to eat dinner but couldn?t, too much pain and increased nausea. Tried to lay down, but began having a fast heartbeat and fast/some difficulty breathing. The pain in my chest was the worst pain I?ve ever felt. Continued feeling horrible with a fever of 100.7, nausea, headache pains throughout chest back and arms, freezing, and my arms and legs felt like they were becoming numb. Could not stand, very dizzy, tried to sleep through it. I threw up around 11 and did so a couple more times after that. Was finally able to sleep and woke up feeling much better. Arm is still sore at the injection point.

                                                I gave the vaccine around 6:20pm after counseling on possible adverse reactions and going over the patient&#39;s questions. I then asked them to wait 15min. Within 5-10mins the patient got up and came back to our counter saying he thinks he&#39;s having a reaction. I pulled him back into our vaccination area and had him sit down and explain what he was feeling to me. He looked pale and told me he felt dizzy, sweaty, shaky, &amp; nauseous. He wanted me to grab him a bag incase he puked. I grabbed a bag as well as water and Benadryl. I asked if he was having any issues breathing or if it felt like his tongue was swollen at all. He said no issues breathing and tongue felt fine.  He started to feel better within about 10-15 minutes after onset. He did not puke and his color returned. I had him wait an additional 10-15 minutes after that to make sure we were recovered. I asked him if there was anything else going on and he mentioned that he hadn&#39;t slept well the night before and that he had barely eaten today. He also mentioned he can get anxiety. I told him all of those factors could certainly contribute to what he just experienced but that I would be reporting this on to be safe.

                                                Approximately eight hours after injection, sweeping to severe fatigue began to onset along with severe headache and moderate to severe chills, along with other &#34;flu-like&#34; symptoms, including symptoms of fever but no recorded fever.  Lasted through the night and hindered sleep without the help of OTC sleep medication.  After 8 hours of overnight sleep, woke up next day feeling better, but still had a terrible headache and a great deal of fatigue.  Considered visiting a walk-in clinic or the ER at least four times throughout this timeframe.  Symptoms lessened with time with a bad headache and lingering fatigue being the most consistent 24 to 36 hours after the initial injection time.  Now May 3 at 1:00pm, several days after, most symptoms have subsided except for some lingering fatigue which still is present.

                                                On day 1 (April 15) of noticing my body was very off after the vaccine I had Leg pain and severe headaches, I say severe because though I rarely get headaches and stay hydrated I could tell this headache really hurt and lasted the full day and several days after (something I have never had happen to me) Also on April 15, I had leg pain, If I took a step off a few inches curb or stair step I felt sharp pain shoot up my leg. On April 16th I still had the headaches and leg pain , but also while driving I began loosing my vision and started to pass out/faint. I Pulled over and waited at least a half hour. during that time I. noticed I couldn&#39;t type or read anything on my phone as I was trying to reach a friend to help me. eventually after time had passed I was able to drive myself to a friends where I thought the best thing would be to sleep it off. the headaches and leg pain lasted a couple more days and I thought it was going to go away, but it is now May 5th and today and last couple days the leg pain feels more like someone has been punching my left leg. five had chest pain and headaches return. I do not have medical insurance and have avoided going to the hospital or primary care because I am afraid. today the pain is so irritating and sore I wish I could escape my body.

I sat him down immediately, he was having trouble staying awake eyes glossing over, speech very slow. I turned to push the door open into the main pharmacy to call for help and have them dial 911, grabbed epinephrine and ammonia salts as well. When I turned back he had slumped in his chair. As I took the step back towards him, he spontaneously started to sit up and speak. Was diaphoretic, still slow speech eyes glossy. I supported him as best I could. His HR was 42, i lifted his legs up unto to a chair in quazi trandelenburg position. He stated that made him feel alot better. I stayed with him until EMTS arrived. He got himself onto they stretcher and they took him out of the store.

                                                Muscle aches in armpits began a few hours after receiving the dose.  Within 8 hours of dose, a mild fever and chills began (around 100 degrees F). I attempted to take a bath to soothe aches but it did not help, and instead tried to go to sleep at 8:30 pm. A slight red rash appeared on chest and arms around this time.  I was woken up at 10:30 pm feeling disoriented and hot, with a fever of 104.5 degrees F. My wife noticed slurring of words and that I seemed unstable and confused, and symptoms were severe enough we considered going to the emergency room.  I experienced ringing in my ears and a severe headache.  I took 2 extra strength Tylenol, put a cold cloth on forehead, and drank fluids to fall back asleep.  Fever dropped to around 102 but continued throughout the night.  I woke up at 6:30 am and took two more Tylenol.  The severe headache continued and I vomited twice.  I attempted to take a shower and rinse off, and continue to rest.  Fever is reduced to 99 degrees F with help of Tylenol.

Felt &#34;cloudy&#34; in thoughts and couldn&#39;t focus or complete any tasks.  Was not able to sleep at all that night.  Around 8 AM the following day the fever reduced to 101, but cough started and felt fatigued.  Fever dropped to 99 by the evening, but cough and fatigue persisted.  Fever completely gone on Friday 3/12/21, but cough and fatigue are still present as of 3/15/21.  Current cough is inconsistent (few times an hour) and fatigue is better than previous but still present.

I drank a ton of fluids, used OTC treatments (Ibuprofen and Motrin) but nothing alleviated the pain. By 10 am I had a sustained fever over 100 degrees. I was in so much pain I was crying in bed. By 3 pm my fever reached 102 degrees. I had to go to the emergency room for IV drip and medication because I couldn&#39;t drink enough water to stay hydrated. Once given IV, my temperature plummeted. When the medication they administered wore off, my body started experiencing mild to moderate pains again. Body aches and soreness all over- my muscles feel like they are being squeezed from the inside. I am still feeling a lot of fatigue and pain but it is random and comes and goes along with &#34;hot flashes&#34;.

BP checked at 6:38pm (170/98, pulse 105).  Patient stated his blood pressure usually runs high. I offered him an ice pack a second time, but he said there was no need and he felt better.  BP checked again 6:52pm (152/101, pulse 99).  I recommended that since his blood pressure is usually this high, he should follow up with his primary doctor regarding blood pressure as he may need some medication to assist in lowering it.  He said ok.  He left the pharmacy area at 7:02pm and said he was fine to leave, he did not want to remain any longer.

No signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis were identified so the patient was observed and monitored.  The patient then became unconscious for approximately 10-15 seconds with small jerking movements identified during this time. 911 was called and the patient was monitored until EMS arrived.  Epinephrine was prepared and ready during this whole time but was not administered because the patient didn&#39;t show symptoms of anaphylaxis (trouble breathing or talking, trouble swallowing, hives, flushing etc).  The  time from vaccine administration to EMS arrival was approximately 20-25 minutes.   The patient was able to talk and communicate clearly the entire time except during the brief unconscious period.

I was monitoring his temperature and he did not have a fever. I was massaging his hands and legs, this went on for 45 minutes to 1 hour. When the shaking subsided, the fever started, at this point I gave him Tylenol and continued to monitor his temperature.  He is better this morning.

Did not have an allergic reaction. Did not need to call 9-1-1. Just worked himself up so much about it. Sent him home as I didn&#39;t want him to complete his shift while vomiting. Was having chills and wasn&#39;t sure how long they were going to last. Left him to go home with girlfriend. Went out front to wait for his ride and get some fresh air. Exchanged numbers so I could keep in contact with him. Knows to contact EMS if symptoms worsen.

My adverse effects were the following throwing up, pain in the upper Portion of my neck and slight pain in my chest , and fever with chills  grandually getting worse throughout the day.  By 9:00pm - midnight I couldn?t even sleep or close my eyes to sleep because the pain was unbarring that I had to call my family for mental support.  I eventually fell asleep because of exhaustion, and Sunday I couldn?t even get out of bed my body was so worn out from the shot and the night. I stayed home all day and slept . I still  have pains in my neck and coughing becomes my issue.

Muscles in both arms were extremely tight and no control of my fingers as it was painful to extend them beyond a fist. Could barely walk and stand for more than 20 seconds as well.  - Took tylenol and benadryl before going to hospital but had little to no effect.  - Arrived at the hospital at 9:30 with severe pain throughout my body and the effects subsided by 12:30am.

                                                Jansen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  On 04/12/2021 at 11:30pm (5 days after I was originally vaccinated), I started to itch inside of the crooks of both of my arms were starting to itch. After a few minutes of not scratching the crooks of my arms, I had noticed that both crooks of my arms were still red. I then took off my shirt and realized that I had an extensive rash with hives all over my trunk. I also had a sudden onset of nasal congestion and sneezing during this same time period. I took Benadryl and Pepsid on that same night and then saw my primary care doctor the following morning. My primary care doctor diagnosed my rash/hives as a probable result. I was instructed to continue with the Benadryl and Pepsid and watch for any changes.

Tylenol helped but when it wore off I recorded a high 103-low 104 degree fever. Tylenol and a bath helped bring it down, rest of day just headache  and weakness, sweating. By 4pm next day started feeling a bit more normal. The night/morning of was the worst fever/sickness I can remember feeling.

Then felt throat tingling and tightness on his drive home.  Came back to the pharmacy, drank some water, we opted to give him loratadine instead of benadryl since he had a 2&#43; hour back home.  He stayed in the pharmacy for another hour and was able to drink water and eat a snack with no issues and wanted to continue on his trek home. He called us when he arrived home and was feeling fine.

I shook him and said his name while my coworker called 911.A retired nurse assisted me . As patient was coming  to he tried to stand up and appeared to be convulsing, so we sat him back in the chair. He then wasa responsive but sweating profusely.  We got him to the floor andput cold compresses on forehead and neck and waited for 911 to arrive.  They released him to his girlfriend to bring him home.

Helped to lie down on matt, with feet in chair, and cool cloth applied to neck. Blood pressure was 100/64 and pulse was 64. After about 2 minutes, he said he felt better than when he first came in. I asked him if he had ever had this happen before and he said yes when he had blood drawn a few years ago. He was helped to sit up in a chair. He no longer had any light-headedness and his color was returning to normal. His lips were now pink. He was given a granola bar and water to drink. After staying for 20 minutes longer he left. He was called the next day by me and he said he had not had any light-headedness after he left.

                                                vasovagal syncope or seizure? After receiving the drive-through vaccine, we drove into a parking space to sit and make sure I was ok. Within 5-10 minutes, I was sitting in the car and sending a text and with no warning whatsoever mid-text lost consciousness, profuse sweating, wheezing, lost color in my skin, was making unintelligible noises, and eventually woke up about a minute later but couldn&#39;t speak or comprehend those speaking to me (according to my wife who was terrified).  I was not nervous, stressed, or scared of receiving a vaccine. I regained the ability to speak about a minute later and my wife had summoned the staff on the scene who instructed me to lie back and breathe without a mask. I drank some liquids. A nurse was called over and offered to take my vital signs but I decided I felt ok enough not to. Eventually my normal skin color and came back and sweating stopped after about 5 minutes. We sat for a few extra minutes and once I felt it was past me,  my wife drove us home.

                                                At 6:00 PM 3/12 I began to feel slightly dizzy. It did not effect my ability to stand or move around very much, but my head did feel strange and if I turned to quickly I would need a second to gather myself. However, it was not severe enough to force me to sit or lay down. By 7:00-7:30 I began to feel hot and uncomfortable and I took my temperature at 7:30 and I was running a low grade fever at 99.8 degrees F. I began to feel very fatigued and was in bed by 9:00 PM. I woke up feeling fine and my temperature at 7:00 AM 3/13 is 97.8 degrees F. My only possible side effect this morning (3/12 as I write this) is that I am mildly stiff, mostly in my left arm, neck, and back (the side of the injection site). Despite the mild fever I did not feel any nausea, nor did I have difficulty breathing. Overall the side effects were mild but uncomfortable.

The fourth and fifth day my lips and face would become tingly/numb and my left arm would get weak and I would feel a little disoriented, my sleep has been pretty disturbed. It felt like I was having a stroke. I did not have a stroke,  I continue to occasionally feel the above symptoms, a little less potent than they were, they might be going away, I can&#39;t tell. I will be calling my doctor if it continues.

Slept until 11:15pm and woke up to violent shivering, pounding headache, full body aches, sore skin, achey joints, nausea, swelling tongue and throat. Took 1 dose of nyquil and then tossed and turned all night, very little sleep, symptoms persisted into the next day, but shivering stopped in the night. By morning (3-14) registered a fever of 100.3 which persisted most of the day along with remaining lessening symptoms. By evening I was still very sore, bad headache, and very lethargic/fatigued. Next morning (3-15) low temp of 97.1 degrees, headache, fatigue, lightheaded. Still feel headachy and tired.

                                                12 hours after my shot I developed a severe headache and fever of 102. This persisted for about 7 hours. Then the fever decreased to about 100.5 for the next 24 hours.  After my fever broke, however, I developed a chest cough with some phlegm. This feels like bronchitis and my doctor has prescribed azithromycin. I also feel rolling fatigue, which comes on randomly. The cough and fatigue has persisted so far for 6 days. In addition, though I do not have a fever most of the day, on some nights my fever spikes (last night, reaching 102 for a short period of time while trying to sleep). It has been 8 days since my injection. I have very little appetite (though I can smell and taste fine).

I woke up around 1am on 3/16 with fever/chills/body ache/headaches. Fever was around 103 degrees F at it&#39;s peak and stayed at or above 100 degrees from about 1am until about 5 or 6pm on 3/15. I took tylonel during this time. I also experienced diarrhea and loss of appetite during the day; random periods of feeling nauseous. I seemed to be dehydrated but drank a normal amount of water the day before. It felt like I had the flu, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve felt this sick since I was a kid. It was terrible. I felt incredibly tired on Tuesday but couldn&#39;t fall asleep. 3/17--woke up today feeling mostly fine minus a bit of lingering soreness and feeling very tired still.

                                                I had extreme chest pain on the 24th of March. It really hurt to breathe and it felt like I had pressure on my chest. I went to the Emergency room and they did a chest x-ray and a Covid-19 both of which were negative. I went home and I returned to the ER because the chest pain became worse. The chest X-Ray the second day showed I had pneumonia. I was told that it could have been from the Covid-19 in December or if was community acquired.  I was prescribed with antibiotics and discharged. I still feel some chest pain  after about a week and I have already finished the full course of antibiotics. I&#39;ve seen my Primary Care physician, my cardiologist and my Pulmonologist.

About 10 minutes later I was notified someone wasn&#39;t doing well. I went to the patient and he was hunched down and looked pale and he stated he was very dizzy. I asked him if he had trouble breathing and he stated he had not. He appeared like he was about to pass out, I was asking him questions about his state and he wasn&#39;t being coherent. I told him I was going to give an EpiPen and call 911. I gave him the EpiPen in his outer thigh. EMS came 5 minutes later.  A few hours later I got a call from a close by asking if I had given him a Benadryl because he was feeling drowsy. I asked his status and the nurse stated he was doing fine.

                                                High fever reaching 103.8° F. Between 7pm and 12am, my fever ranged from 100-103.8° F Elevated resting heart rate of 90-130 beats per minute. My normal is 62-75 bpm. While I was sleeping, my heart rate ranged from 93-113 bpm (according to Apple Watch). Extreme headache Inability to sleep Chills and shakes Extreme fatigue Light headed and unable to speak clearly  I don?t know if this was life threatening; I know it was likely my immune system responding but these side effects were extreme. I almost called an ambulance. I?ve never felt pain like that before in my head. My heart felt like it was racing all night and my brain felt like it was going to expand out of my skull. The head pain, heart rate, and rapid breathing was keeping me up.  I tried to sleep 7pm?12am which was the worst of it. By the middle of the night, it seemed that the fever subsided and my resting heart rate was more in the 90-100 range (still 15-30% high).   The next day, I have a moderate headache that feels like after pain from the night before. Fever subsided. Heart rate is slightly high at 80-100 bpm. I managed to sleep in the whole morning.  I had to take off from work today in order to rest.

To this day (one month later) by ability to recall memories and recall words remains poor. I have troubles forming sentences because words don&#39;t come to me. To this day I cannot recall anything that happened days 1-3 after the vaccine. I was able to write this report because my partner made me take notes on how I felt. Prior to the vaccine I never had an issue with memory recall. My physical reactions cleared during the second week after the vaccine. However, the mental reactions still stubbornly persist.

                                                I received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA at roughly 2:15pm on Sunday 4/11/21. I waited at the vaccination site for 30 minutes and did not have any adverse effects. I went through the rest of my day without any adverse effects. I went to bed at 9:00pm. I woke up at 11:00pm with body aches and chills. I could not stop shivering. I then became very warm. I alternated between freezing/shivering and burning up all night. I felt very sore and my muscles hurt. It was primarily my upper body that hurt, not my lower body. My arms, torso, back, and neck hurt to move. I was very sensitive to everything I touched. It felt uncomfortable to touch the blankets in my bed or the water when I washed my hands. It did not hurt to do that, it just felt sensitive and uncomfortable. Around 5:00am I got a terrible headache. It felt like my head was made out of a lead ball. It hurt to move lift my head. My face hurt and felt like I had pressure. This lasted all day for Monday 4/12/21. After 5:00pm I slowly started to feel better. My body aches went away. I still had a headache, but it was far less severe. It is approximately 7:00am on 4/13/21 as I am filling this out. I still have a minor but persisting headache. My left arm is sore at the injection site. I am feeling much better than I was.

The severe headache continued throughout the rest of the week 5-6 days. During days 5 &amp; 6 I noticed new symptoms- a feeling pressure/constriction in my hands/wrists. In addition, I noticed (2) bloody stools over days 5 &amp; 6 - 1 each day in the morning.  Both symptoms seemed to have gone away after day 6. However, pressure/constriction in my hands/wrists and headaches has been noticeable intermitately since. No distinct or identified activities or food-related timing during or causing the onset of the pressure/constriction in my hands/wrists or headaches symptoms thus far.

                                                12 hours after receiving JNJ vaccine, experienced fever, chills, headache, sore throat, body aches (these symptoms resolved after 24 hours). 24 hours after, experienced hives on both arms, upper back and hips. Hives eventually were limited to only arms after 3 days. 7 days after experiencing on and off hives, I took an antihistamine until hives disappeared for longer than 24 hours.  Hives were not itchy, but large and warm to the touch. No single hive lasted for more than 24 hours.  They disappear and reappear randomly on my arms. Specially over veins. It has been over a month since my vaccine and I?m still experiencing these hives that appear and disappear at random. I?ve documented each hive outbreak with photos and currently undergoing blood tests trying to learn more about this issue.

I move to my bed. 7:30 PM - In bed, dressed in sweatshirt, wool socks, etc., a a couple blankets wrapped around me, space heater turned to 80 degrees, shaking uncontrollably from being so cold (mostly hands and feet), mild headache begins in middle back of head.  8:00 PM - still freezing, temperature was at 98.7. most of body is aching 9:00 PM - chills and body ache starting to slow down, temperature at 100.3 9:30 PM - still have chills, space heater still on and i was still wrapped in a bunch of clothing/blankets. temp at 100.5 and i drank 6 oz water.  10 PM - chills going away, heat/blankets/clothing still on, temp at 101. body aches mostly only in left and right calf.   Rest of night until around 4 A.M. was me tossing and turning being restless. My heart rate was ~130 BPM throughout the entire night according to my smart watch. I was checking my temperature constantly with an infrared thermometer and it was between 101-102.5. I probably drank ~24 oz of water throughout the night. It felt like each time i fell asleep, i would wake up no more than 30 min later and each time i woke up it felt like i had been asleep for 5 hours. At a few moments it felt like i was hallucinating seeing little boxes around my head.. At no point  during the episode did i take any advil/tyenol/etc. Only drank water. Woke up around noon the next day, I felt extremely groggy, still had a headache and my temperature was back to ~98.  I ate for the first time that day around 1 P.M. and had a few advil which helped with my headache.

Currently (6 days after vaccine) I have feeling of pressure in head above left ear. Pressure accompanied by slight headache, dizziness, feeling flush, stomach pain, and tingling in right hand.   These symptoms haven&#39;t changed over last 4 days, and most pronounced is head pressure, dizziness, and general disorientation.   Haven&#39;t taken medication, just getting good rest and hydration, but symptoms aren&#39;t lessening.

At day 7 I started to feel sharp, cramps, tingly sensation and numbness in different parts of my legs, arms feet and hands. I also had headaches and felt dizzy. Headaches went away by day 15, but the pain, tingly sensation and fatigue in my arms and legs still remain (tomorrow it?s going to be a month since I got my shot). It gets significantly worse when I walk and I feel very fatigued after walking for about 30 minutes.  The pin has also appeared less frequently on other parts of my body, like my heart, my neck and around my rib area. Over the last two weeks my legs have also been getting itchy.

                                                Patient received vaccine at around 11am.  After waiting around for a few minutes he stated he was light headed.  I went over to observe and gave patient some water.  He was starting to sweat and turned very pale.  1 minute later he passed out.  I brought him to the floor from his chair and he  starting shaking and &#39;seizing&#34; for about 10-15 seconds.  We used pressure on his chest to try to &#34;snap&#34; him out of it.  After about 15 seconds of &#34;seizing,not breathing normally and his left arm completely locked up&#34; he came to and did not know where he was for about 2-3 minutes.  After about that time he started to realize where he was and recognized his wife who was assisting.  EMS was called and arrived shortly,  He was lucid and knew where he was and started to feel normal again.  EMS checked his vitals and they were normal.  Patient refused to go to hospital and EMS released him to his wife.  I checked on patient 4 hours later and he had no ill effects and stated he felt just like he did before receiving the vaccination.

The injection site pain and fatigue will hopefully be cured by getting a good sleep tonight; nausea was offset by Tums. The temperature flashes are still occurring 9 hours after injection and do not seem to be getting worse any more; hands and feet cannot warm up and neck and forehead are hot (no thermostat to look at temperature).

No treatment sought at this time.

                                                Patient received vaccine and reported approximately 5 minutes later that he needed help. Within just a few seconds following him calling for help he was not able to talk and his eyes had rolled into the back of his head. His body was rigid but he did not lose consciousness. A technician called 911.  He was sweating profusely so his jacket was removed and a cold rag applied to his head. He finally came to after approximately 1-2 minutes and reported that he was feeling very dizzy. His blood pressure was 118/80 and temperature was 98.5 degrees Fahrenheit. He was examined by an EMT, and they found a very similar blood pressure.  Patient reported feeling much better and was fine to go home. Treatment occurred over a 15 minute window.

I also drank a lot of water and some Powerade and orange juice. April 2:  I continued to take acetaminophen every 6 hours. Temperature stayed between 100 and 102 until noon, then between 98.9 and 99.5 until evening.

He said that he was texting on his phone and the next thing he knew, he was on the ground with people around him asking if he was ok. He stated that he was very sweaty, nauseous, and a little dizzy. We called a code white, provided the pt with a cold compress and elevated his feet. Pt did not want us to call 911. Pt did not have PCP and has not been to a doctor in about 5 years. He said he was very nervous getting the shot and is afraid of needles so that may have contributed. Pt stayed in the pharmacy area for about 45 minutes until he started to feel better and his mom came to get him. I tried calling pt again at 7:10pm to check in, but there was no answer and I could not leave a voicemail due to mailbox being full.

                                                Shortly after, I began to feel &#34;woozy&#34; and a bit &#34;out of it&#34; mentally. Mostly fatigued but didn&#39;t limit my ability to do normal activity things. Around 10:30pm that night, I got a 100.3 degree F fever, aggressive chills, and a headache. Woke up around 11:30 and the fever had broken (due to taking a Tylenol before bed).   Day after vaccine, heaviness in left arm (injection arm). General fatigue and headache. Most prevalent symptom was achy body.

                                                Joints began feeling achy and body felt tired within a few hours of vaccination. About 10 hours later body began to feel warm and then within an hour began uncontrollable shivers and aching in testicles followed shortly after by a throbbing headache and pain behind eyeballs. I put on extra clothing and jumped into bed as symptoms persisted. Later in the night I began sweating profusely and removed the clothing. The headache and pain behind the eyes persisted. I also began feeling nauseous and almost vomited when I went to the bathroom. My body was so tired and achy I could barely move. I tried to wake up for work but my headache and pain behind the eyes was so bad I went back to bed for another four hours. I did not have any appetite for the rest of the day.  My headache subsided that afternoon and I went for a walk that night and my body still felt incredibly tired and achy. The pain behind my eyes persisted. The following day I felt somewhat better and could work. That night I went for a jog and my body felt extremely heavy, my joints ached, and I could not catch my breath. My symptoms continued to improve but I have had no sex drive for a week.

My eyes felt like they were being pushed out of their sockets. My body hurt. It hurt to move. My neck , knees, ankles and back were in shooting dull pain. It took everything I had to stand up. I couldn&#39;t get to sleep. I had a fever. I started to shiver. My thought raced. It began to hurt to breath. My lower chest is sore on the inside where the lungs meets the rib cage.   I could not to go class or do any work. Was easily one of the worst nights of my life.

                                                I developed extreme body aches and chills along with an extreme fever, and it progressed throughout the night until I was delirious. I fainted once trying to take medication (ibeprofen) in the bathroom. I never measured the fever because I was delirious and could hardly move due to pain. I have never felt so sick in my life and I am a healthy 30 year old with no other health issues. I am feeling better this morning but have lingering symptoms of chills and aches. I am reporting this because the intensity of the reaction seemed overwhelmingly extreme and scary for someone of my health and age.

                                                After being screened to enter the healthcare facility and completing the intake screening for COVID vaccine, patient received the Janssen COVID vaccine at approximately 11:00am.  Several minutes later while sitting in the observation area, patient stated that he felt like throwing up and that he had a headache.  He said he just started feeling tired.  He denied any shortness of breath, swelling in his mouth or throat, or rashes.  He stated he had not eaten breakfast in the morning.  When his vital signs were checked, his blood pressure was 149/94 and heart rate was 90.  He was alert and oriented.  He was transported to the facility urgent care for further assessment and observation. In urgent care, he appeared to become more lethargic, although his vital signs remained stable.  911 was called.   While waiting for the ambulance, staff spoke to the patient&#39;s brother (who had been waiting outside for patient).  Patient&#39;s brother stated that patient had a fever and stomachache the night before, and that patient had a recent surgery and had not completed his post-op antibiotic course.  Patient&#39;s brother stated that he came to clinic anyways for the vaccine appointment because he wanted to get the COVID vaccine so that he could return to work (as required by his employer).   Patient was transported to  Hospital.  Per nurse report, he was released from the emergency room after a brief observation period.

It was strange enough that I made a note to call my doctor if it persisted, but the headache was gone the day after.

                                                I received the vaccine on Wednesday, April 7th.  I was told I had an anaphylactic reaction at the time of injection: I started sweating upon receiving the vaccine, my blood pressure dropped, and I almost passed out. I was monitored for 30 mins before being sent home. Other than some fatigue, I was fine the rest of the day.  On Thursday, April 8th, I was tired but felt fine otherwise.  Friday and Saturday, April 9th and 10th, I felt like I was back to normal and even did some light exercise.  On Sunday morning, April 10th, the left side of my body (side of injection) went numb, I had extreme vertigo, shortness of breath, and blotches that appeared in random places. It didn&#39;t look like hives, but rather looked like strips of red. I didn&#39;t feel like I was having an allergic reaction, but something did not feel right. I consider myself a pretty healthy guy with a healthy lifestyle. I did not feel the need to go to the ER quite yet, but I did have a friend come over to monitor me.  My friend did some acupuncture which helped resolve the numbness and dizziness and some of the blotches, and also mentioned concerns regarding blood circulation and potential clotting issues she thought I was having.

                                                Immediately after injection: pain and soreness around injection site.  Starting about 3-4 hours later: impaired coordination.  The next morning: severe dehydration, disorientation, loss of balance, very low energy, headache, body aches, inability to remain standing or sitting, difficulty walking, fever, feeling hot and cold, sweating and shivering intermittently and sometimes both at the same time, impaired mental focus, worsened pain and soreness around the injection site, nightmares. Slept the majority of the day, rising only to eat and drink lots of water.  Symptoms abated throughout the day. By about 7pm, I was able to sit up enough to play some video games.  The second morning: most symptoms gone or almost unnoticeable.  Hot/cold flashes, impaired coordination and low energy continue, but improving. Attempted to go out for my usual 2-mile jog after work, but only made it about one block walking before becoming both too cold and too tired to continue.  The third day, afternoon: completed my usual 2-mile route, at a walk, with frequent stops to rest.  No noticeable symptoms from the 4th day after injection, onwards.

Over the course of the day, the fever and all other symptoms gradually subsided. By the morning of the next day (4/10/2021) I was completely back to normal and feeling healthy again.

                                                I woke up in a very heavy sweat and got up to use the bathroom. I felt unsteady. After washing my hands, I turned to the towel and vaguely remember falling to the floor. When I came to, I was too weak to get up. I laid there for 5 minutes before struggling to sit. After some time I was able to weakly return to bed and drank some rehydration tablets. My best guess was I had been drinking water but not replenishing my electrolytes.

                                                Seizure - I have never had a seizure before and there is no history of epilepsy in my family. I had the Janssen vaccine shot at around 5PM on Thursday and felt mostly fine on Friday. I had typical shot symptoms (tired and soreness near injection sight). On Friday night around 10:00, I was standing talking to one of my friends in the living room when I had a blackout seizure without any warning. The seizure only lasted about 30-45 seconds, and then I became conscious again. It took me about 5-10 minutes to become completely aware and able to stand up. I have never had a seizure before and have not had one since then.  Later the following week, I did have a couple of hours where I felt extremely dizzy and lightheaded, but it went away without another seizure. This is also not typical for me.

When the exhaustion would hit, starting the day after injection, I was too weak to go up and down stairs. It seemed significant and was more than normal tiredness, and I ended up needing to take a half day at work four days after vaccination. On the sixth day after vaccination, I was feeling well again and discomfort at the injection site had subsided as well.  It was the worst the day after getting vaccinated, which was to be expected. I did not expect it to last so long.

Pharmacist rushed to help him up and he complained of feeling very hot and sweating profusely. He did not have any swelling/itching of throat/facial area. Patient was provided cold water, and told to remain seated. Pt was asked questions such as name, what day it is, to establish if patient was alert and oriented. Patient complained of experiencing tunnel vision while passing out. He proceeded to pass out once more, while seated, this time the pharmacist was able to support him in his chair.  After the water and rest, patient said he felt much better and his girlfriend came to escort him home. He stayed for about 30 minutes before leaving and staff made sure he was feeling alright.

I asked him if he would like some water and he accepted. He returned to the chair in front of the pharmacy and sipped on the water. He looked like he was pale and breathing more slowly. I went out front to check on him and his breathing appeared labored, he was sweating profusely and he said he felt lightheaded and his hands were tingling. I told him to relax and take some breaths. His hands were very shaky and I took him BP (94/61 and HR 54). At this point I had my technician call 911.  Between the time the paramedics arrived he went unresponsive for approx 20-30 seconds. I yelled his name and slapped his leg. No response. I checked for a pulse and if he was breathing. He did have a pulse and was breathing. After coming to the paramedics arrived and took him to the hospital for evalution.

I didn&#39;t get much sleep due to the body aches.  By 8am my symptoms began to fade.  I felt fatigued and had a headache by noon.

                                                As expected from any vaccine I&#39;ve received, I have a sore arm that is lasting over 3 days (again, this is expected). What I wasn&#39;t quite expecting: -Fever at 101 for 48 hours -Extreme fatigue for 48 hours -Alternating chills and hot flashes/sweating for 48 hours -Quite strong aches and pains (hurt to lay down, sit, stand, just existing hurt) for 48 hours -Headache for 48 hours -Itchy/sore throat around the 24 hour mark, lasting to the 36 hour mark from time of injection  Treatment: I took 400 mg of Ibuprofen around the 12 hour mark from vaccination (about 5 hours after fever spiked at 101--fever rose no higher than 101). I continued 400 mg of Ibuprofen the next morning and once more that same evening (two does of 400 mg Ibuprofen). Each of those doses brought fever down to around 99 for about 4 hours, and I felt considerably better (though definitely still quite sick--just not contained-to-lying-in-bed sick). I took 200 mg of Ibuprofen around the 36 hour mark, and that was it. Fever then back to normal range (approx 98) and feeling 95%-100% recovered all day.  Obviously none of those are life-threatening, but they sure knocked me out. Definitely way worse than the &#34;mild&#34; symptoms advertised. I&#39;m definitely not complaining, as I&#39;m overjoyed to now be vaccinated, and I&#39;m so grateful for the scientific community, the CDC, and you people reading this right now for all your work in making it happen, and doing it as safely as possible. Thank you!

On Monday, I woke up and I was too dizzy to walk. The initial dizziness subsided but I&#39;m still having balance issues as of Wednesday night. A doctor prescribed meclizine which didn&#39;t help.

Upon standing up from the laying down position, I got lightheaded, started profusely sweating, became nauseous and ultimately lost consciousness. When I regained my consciousness, there was a loud ringing in my ears and my hands were numb. I took some Tylenol, laid down and it subsided shortly after. I did not experience any symptoms as severe as this at any point again.

It was a horrible night of discomfort and pain.

Patient said he had fever within 24 hours of the vaccine and was feeling miserable (severe fatigue, chills, fever, nausea, headaches).  He said he was feeling slightly better than the first 24 hours but still feeling really bad. He has been taking Advil which has help slightly.  I advised him to monitor symptoms and to call dr if symptoms get worst and to keep us posted.    I called patient today to follow up with patient and he said that he was not feeling that much better.  He did have a virtual visit with his doctor and was prescribed azithromycin, prednisone, and an inhaler.  Patient has been on medication for a couple of days.  He will continue meds and call us if things do not improve

                                                9 hours after receiving the vaccine, around 5:00 PM on 3/21/2021, I experienced a fever, nausea, headache, soreness in muscles/joints, and chills.  The next morning, these symptoms had all gone away. A couple of days after the vaccination, I believe on 3/23/2021, I began experiencing unexplained back pain and shortness of breath. This pain was severe at time and I still have a dull pain in my back as of today, 4/15/2021.

                                                The afternoon after I got the shot I went for a jog. When I returned, I got intense chills and a fever of 103 degrees along with some flu like symptoms. I had a slight headache. Ibuprofen helped but the next day I had similar symptoms, but they went away by the end of the day. On the third day I felt a little better, so I went for a run. I had some shortness of breath and it was difficult to breathe when I was running. I normally run 4 miles daily. The shortness of breath was present for a week after that and also started to happen intermittently even at rest. One week after the shot I saw a doctor and they did some testing but did not find anything definitive. Six weeks after the shot I went to the ER and they diagnosed with Thrombocytopenia. At this point it has been seven weeks the shortness of breath has improved, and I haven&#39;t experienced it for a few days.

                                                Pt scheduled appointment for and received correct J&amp;J Covid Vaccine that was requested.  There were no issues with processing nor provision. PT advised RPH that he had a problem with needles and experienced low blood pressure every time he was vaccinated or had blood drawn in the past but had done better the last time and did not want to miss out on getting the vaccine.  RPH was prepared and patient was cared for properly.  Pt arrived at 1244 hrs and was provided vaccine at 1247 hours. Patient was fine for about 1 minute and then reported he was having trouble.  Pt remained seated in booth in chair with room to get to floor if needed.  RPH remained with patient, brought his significant other into the booth to help calm the patient as he was alert and orientated and continued to improve while removed mask and fanned with papers (pt stated the fanning was helping).  Pt was improving slowly and moving/trying different positions as he felt he was improving.  At approx 1325 hrs pt knew he needed to lie down and moved himself to floor with the assistance of his significant other and associate (did not fall nor did head impact the floor at any time).  Code White was called.  PT remained alert and orientated and was talking and stated that this was really helping.  Code Team arrived and pt was continuously monitored until he gradually returned to his feet and was able to leave under his own power.  Pt refused medical attention and refused Ambulance - never lost consciousness so no EMT was called.  Pt&#39;s significant other was able to drive them home.  Event concluded at approximate 1345hrs.

I was able to get the patient to the floor and he became responsive.  He said he &#34;was ok&#34;.  We had contacted EMS.  We had the patient lie flat until the EMT&#39;s arrived.  He was very sweaty and tired but he insisted he was fine.  He refused to go to the ER and he was able to get a ride home.

                                                At 23:15 (7 hours after the dose) I started to get cold while under my blankets trying to sleep. My teeth began chattering as I started to shiver. I got up out of bed to put on a sweater. With each step I took towards the sweater my body started to fully shiver and contract. After about 4 or 5 steps I could no longer move and I fell over. I started having full body spasms and full contractions. I felt like I pulled every muscle in my body trying to relax and fight the contractions. It felt like I was being tasered for about 10-15 minutes. Once I had the strength to grab my sweater I slipped it on. As my body warmed up these contraction subsided.  By 01:00 (9 hours after dose) my body temperature had spiked. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer to check my temperature but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I spiked a fever. I placed a wet cloth on the back of my neck, forehead and chest to cool down.   At 06:00 (14 hours after dose) I took a cold shower to further drop my body&#39;s temperature. It felt like a full body sun burn where you just radiate heat. I was hot everywhere.  At 08:00 (16 hours after dose) I took three (3) 500mg ibuprofen to help fight a nagging headache. I did not have much appetite for food. I regularly eat breakfast in the morning (bowl of cereal).   From 09:00 to 12:00 (17-20 hours after dose) I felt groggy. Did not seem or act like myself. Was very tired from the lack of sleep the night prior. Seemed very fatigued.  Around 13:00 (21 hours after dose) I took a 45-60 minute nap. Woke up feeling much better. I would say most / if not all symptoms subsided after 22-24 hours.

                                                Twenty-four hours after the vaccine I got fever, chills and body aches. Three days after the vaccine I had irritation in my right eye. The next day my eye was more irritated, and it was uncomfortable. I had a telehealth visit and they gave me antibiotic drops. I was diagnosed by an optometrist on the five days after the vaccine with the Shingles virus. The Shingles are still present on my eye after three weeks and I am taking steroids for that.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the injection, I became dizzy and lightheaded. My  eyesight became blurry and my hearing very &#34;tinny&#34;. I felt nausea and  thought I was going to throw up. I sat down in a chair and was given a granola bar and some water. After about 3 or 4 minutes the majority of these  seemed to fade, but I still felt slightly &#34;off&#34;. Approximately 9pm that evening I felt very fatigued, so I went to bed. At approximately midnight, I woke up shivering, extremely cold, and sweating. Around 2am I had a fever of 102.3. I took some Tylenol to try to bring my fever down, which seemed to help. Around 9am the next morning my fever was gone, though I still felt extremely fatigued.  Later that evening, after several naps, I started to feel a little better. Most of these adverse events were resolved by 28 hours after injection. I had arm soreness at the injection sight that felt like having been punched in the arm for about a week after the injection.

Took Tylenol and that helped lower the body aches...but only lasted 4-6 hours.

                                                After receiving my Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine I experienced a lack of motor function in my throat. Approximately 40 minutes after having received the shot, I lost the ability swallow. A tingling sensation took the back of my throat and eventually felt as though it moved into my head. The whole experience lasted a couple of minutes. Since that time all other symptoms have been normal, sore, slight fever, etc.

At around 8 pm I couldn&#39;t do anything but lay in bed. I had high flashs and cold flashes every 30 mins. I was laying in bed with a hoodie and sweat pants on and could not stop shaking from being cold. Then 30 mins later I was so hot I had to take everything off. It kept going on like that till the next morning. I just now started to feel better around 10 am the next day.

                                                April 9 Morning: woke up with a mild headache. April 9 Afternoon (12 pm): feeling fatigued and headache grew worse. Plus chills. April 9 (5pm): feeling very cold and tired (worse than noon) April 9 (11:30pm): This time was the most severe for me in respect to side effects. I believe my headache woke me up. The headache was so bad that my eyes hurt as well (swollen almost). I think my fever broke. I felt very ?heavy? all over. The main concern was that around midnight I was having sharp pains on the right side of my body, near where my Liver is located. That was one effect that I did not read about. The sharp pains happened once every few minutes. I considered going to the ER but wasn?t sure. I ended up just changing my shirt, got some water, and went back to bed.  April 10: My appetite was not normal, I ate but very little. The sharp pain on my right side went away but I had a minor headache for the rest of the day.

Then got the chills pretty bad as I laid down to go to bed. Became really sore all over.  Couldn?t stay asleep for more than an hour. Later in the night I started sweating and felt really hot. Also became quite thirsty. During the entire night I also had horrible dreams. After about 5am things started improving. Had some light sensitivity in the morning for a shot bit. By noon I was almost back to 100%

                                                I typically faint when getting shots or blood drawn. I did faint about 10 seconds after the initial shot injection. I was conscious throughout but was not able to speak clearly or control my body even though I could hear everything going on around me. After 30 minutes, I was feeling back to normal. The remainder of the day I felt drowsy and a little out of it. At 12:15am I began to get severe chills and shakes. This lasted throughout the night but was the worst from about 12:15-1:00am. I woke up at 4am with a fever and sweating. My entire body was stiff and in pain with aches specifically in my arms and legs. Very sore pain in my left deltoid where the shot was injected and is still slightly sensitive. It felt like my veins were stiff and in pain and it hurt to move. I had what I can describe as flu like symptoms (i.e. my teeth hurt, my body ached, fever, shakes, body stiffness and overall tiredness and weakness). These all lasted until about 6:30am at the worst and were relieved over the next few hours. I started to feel back to normal around 3pm later that day. That was April 11th. Last night, April 12th, I had trouble sleeping because my left arm was in pain from my elbow to fingers. It was a lingering pain that went away by this morning and  is mostly gone now (morning April 13th).

Around 5 hours after injection I was overcome with extreme lethargy and had to sleep. 8 hours after injection I woke up very nauseous and could not stop salivating, however I never puked. I woke up again 18 hours after injection and felt nauseous and my chronic back pain had returned. I also had a weird throbbing pain in the right side of my neck and in the lower left side of my left leg. All symptoms were gone by ~36 hours after the injection.

                                                I opted for the J&amp;J variant and received it on Monday at 1:00 PM, mere hours before they pulled distribution of it on the national level.  I started feeling flu like fatigue, body aches, and a headache 8 hours post injection. I ran a 101&#43; fever Monday night and got less than 4 hours sleep due to fever and fairly intense muscle aches. On Tuesday morning the headache, fever and muscle aches persisted till the late evening accompanied by general fatigue. By 9:00 on Tuesday night I was feeling significant improvement and slept well Tuesday night with minor night sweats on and off. Wednesday morning I felt 80% back to normal. No fever, minor headache only evident when standing up quickly or sudden head movement, and continued muscles aches body wide specifically in the neck and chest as well as injection site muscle soreness. These symptoms continue to persist into Thursday at the same or perhaps slightly elevated levels. Friday 4/15 symptoms persist with generalized soreness, fatigue, headache,  injection site soreness. Not his typical self.

                                                I experienced a sudden onset of symptoms approximately 7 hours post-vaccination. Symptoms started with severe chills, elevated heart rate, fever (~102), and progressed into muscle and joint soreness, severe migraine with sensitivity to light, and strong fatigue, coupled with insomnia. The symptoms were severe enough that I considered going to the hospital, but ultimately did not. Fever, chills, and elevated heart rate subsided by the next morning (~12 hours after onset), but muscle soreness, migraine, and fatigue lasted for another 12-24 hours, along with a loss of appetite.  I am an otherwise healthy, male adult with no outstanding medical conditions whatsoever. This was one of the most severe immune responses I have ever had, including actual illnesses. I have received other vaccinations in the past and never had any response nearly as severe. I was significantly concerned for my overall health during the height of the vaccine response, and I wanted to report this to ensure that is aware of these types of responses, and can help prepare others by informing them adequately of the types of responses to expect from the vaccine. This response very much took me by surprise in terms of severity -- I had to call out of work at a critical time.

                                                This is a comprehensive neurological evaluation for a very pleasant right handed 32 year old gentleman who denies any past medical history who presents to the hospital with several day progressive visual changes and facial weakness. Patient reports he noted on Saturday that he had somewhat of a headache, he does get headaches from time to time in particular while looking at screens the television, he did have some associated blurring of his vision as well. This was not the worst headache of his life. He had no other associated symptoms. He went to bed on Saturday, he awoke on Sunday and went out to eat and noted that he couldn&#39;t form his mouth around the utensil, his face and lips and mouth felt weak. He still did have an intermittent headache and perhaps some neck pain as well at this point. His vision was still blurry. He denies any recent trauma, no car accident no whiplash no falls. He did go to an outside facility where a CT brain was performed and was normal he was told.

                                                Covid-19 vaccine JJ: 32 y.o. male w/ no PMH presenting 2 weeks after receiving his Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID vaccine after having severe L calf pain found to have thrombocytopenia.    From H&amp;P on 4/21, Patient reports that he had both fevers and aches after his vaccine (4/8/2021). Several days later developed low back pain radiating into his left leg which he initially attributed to sciatica. However, several days later, he went for a 6 mile hike, and felt that his left leg was hurting more. He went to PCP, where he received a blood test and was found to have a platelet count in the low 60s. This was initially thought to be a lab error, but he noticed that his left leg was swollen, somewhat red, and appeared that his blood vessels were swollen. This swelling resolves when he is lying down, and is worsened when he is standing. He received an US to r/o DVT, which was negative. However, after his repeat platelet count demonstrated thrombocytopenia, he was sent to the ED. He denies any recent leg trauma, though he has broken his leg before nearly 15 years ago.  He denies weakness or issues going to the bathroom. Denies chest pain or shortness of breath. Denies chills, fevers, but did wake up last 2 nights drenched in sweat. He also reports a petechial rash on his legs.   As of 4/22, medical team suspects Vaccine-induced thrombocytopenic purpura (VITT). VITT requires 1) thrombocytopenia, 2) documented clot, 3) positive PF4 Ab, and 4) recent AstraZeneca or J&amp;J vaccine. He meets criteria 1, 3, and 4. He has clinical signs of DVT but does not have a documented clot. Patient has L calf tenderness and prominent pooling of blood and vein engorgement of the L leg when he stands up. Possible that he had a DVT or multiple that cleared and now he has post-thrombotic syndrome. This is consistent with the pooling of blood with gravity and relief of symptoms with elevation. As he has had 2 negative US for DVT, unlikely that he has an unresolved DVT. abdominal and head CT are neg for thrombosis.

Starting approx. 3 days after vaccination, patient started noticing altered smell and taste, which has gotten worse in the 14 days since vaccination. Patient also has fatigue and has been experiencing weakness since vaccination. These symptoms are identical to the symptoms the patient had with COVID (starting ~3 weeks after contracting COVID and lasting over a month). The patient contracted COVID in December 2020 and had fully recovered prior to vaccination. Recrudescence of symptoms appears to be due to immunological response to the vaccine.

                                                Approximately 8 hours after injection I began experiencing extreme fatigue. This was soon followed by uncontrollable shaking and chills. As this progressed I began to experience extreme aching pains all over my body, a headache, and dizziness. I fell asleep somewhere around 11pm or 2 hours after on set of symptoms. I awoke multiple times in the night to body aches and a head splitting migraine. During the night the chills and shaking turned into a fever and sweating. At 6am the next day I forced myself to take some painkillers and hydrate. The body aches had started to recede at that point but the migraine was extremely painful and It was nearly impossible to open my eyes with a hypersensitivity to light. I slept on-and-off through the next morning and nearly all symptoms stopped by 1pm on May 8 or 24 hours after the injection.

Vitals were checked and blood pressure/pulse were normal. Ice was applied to patient&#39;s wrist and neck. Patient was till complaining he was not feeling well and was sweating.  Pharmacist had patient lie down on the floor. Paramedics were called to the scene. They also checked his vitals and they were good. Patient refused to go to hospital and stated that he was feeling better.   Everything happened right after the patient received the vaccine. It was not a delayed reaction.

I do not suffer from asthma prior to this vaccine. I experienced headaches, fatigue, congestion, my ears were plugged and I also developed a rash on my arms and I also noticed a lymph node in my neck that I did not have prior to the vaccine. When I went to see my doctor my symptoms were not as prominent and the lymph node in my neck is decreasing in size.

I took an ibuprofen to help reduce the fever then slept. For the next six days I had an on again and off again low grade fever and was nauseas most of the time. Sometime during those 6 days I developed intermitted tingling in my left hand, primarily by index finger. This continues to today happening roughly once a day.  On rare occasion my right had will do the same thing but that is far less often. I never had tingling in either hand prior to my vaccine. I also developed heartburn occurring roughly 1-2 times a day. Prior to the vaccine I rarely (1-2 times a year) had heartburn and I have not changed anything about my diet or lifestyle since my vaccine. Occasionally my head feels &#34;foggy&#34; as well and this began sometime after the vaccine but I can&#39;t recall exactly when it started. It&#39;s not a headache, more of a slight lightheaded, dull feeling. I had none of these symptoms with any regularity until I was administered the vaccine.

                                                Patient began sweating profusely approximately 10 minutes after his vaccine.  He went to his parent&#39;s car and asked his father to turn on the air conditioning as he was hot.  he then passed out in the back seat of the car.  His mother came inside and asked for assistance.  I grabbed an epi-pen and ran outside to the car.  Patient was breathing and had a pulse rate of 64.  He aroused shortly after I began asking him if he could hear me and asked if he could tell me his name.  He was pale (notably his lips were quite pale) and confused.  He could not say his name but could nod appropriately to questions when asked.  We immediately called EMS for assistance.  They arrived within 4-5 minutes and transported the patient to hospital.

                                                I received the shot around 11AM on the 11th. By 5PM that evening I was beginning to have a headache and chills. I drove home from work and by 6PM I had severe chills, I was shaking so bad I could barely fill a cup of water and take ibuprofen, the water was sloshing out of the cup. I had a fever of 102 and spend the rest of the evening in bed, shaking. By around 10 PM the severe chills had subsided and my fever was 101.  I did not sleep much during the night due to a headache and alternating chills/sweating. This morning it is 7 AM and my temperature is 99.5 and I am beginning to feel more normal. I took advil at first and then tylenol every 4 hours during the night.

Patient was then given fluids and lime soda that helped the patient come back to total consciousness. We continued to monitor patient for an extra 30 minutes and called family to pick him to ensure that he does not drive. Moreover, I recommended that the patient does not go snowboarding as he was thinking of heading to the mountains today.

I have felt a bit weak and tired through the day.

Now I still have a minor headache and a dead arm after taking Tylenol (Rapid Release).    I also felt very weak and fatigued all night with a dry mouth and  plugged up sinus. Felt like I was going to be knocked out for 24 hours. I can hardly do these basic task on my work laptop.

This progressed and turned into body chills and extreme body aches for the next 18 hours. Fever topped out at 102F. Those were the only adverse reactions from the vaccine. 2 days after, I am feeling back to normal and ready to resume my normal activities.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  First day after getting the shot I got a feeling of being very tired throughout the day I did not feel like to do anything. Also my arm was very very sore. Even moving it slightly a bit would hurt. The second day is when things got way worse I could not really sleep that well throughout the night because I noticed I had  body aches in my legs and my back. Throughout that day I also felt like I had a fever in the morning I took my temperature and had a 100 fever. At night time I took my temperature and it went up to 102, with  still a bad headache, chills, and body aches throughout my legs mostly. I also felt some palpitations. When I went to bed I was sweating very prefusively all night that I had to change my shirt. On the third day I felt a lot better, still with a slight headache no fever, and still feeling like im sweating on and off.

                                                It was a drive thru shot facility. They gave me a shot in my left arm and asked me to pull around to park.  I parked my vehicle and didn?t feel well so I switched seats with my girl friend. As soon as I got into the passenger seat I was out. She said My eyes rolled back in my head and I started shaking and eyes at this point she said where going up down and side to side . She ran for help and after about 1-2 minutes I  woke up. I thought I passed out so I instantly put my feet on the dash of my car and the pharmacist gave me water and chocolate milk.  He then checked my heart rate it seemed good  and after 20 minutes he let us go home.

Patient was lethargic and confused when coming back. Patient then began to remember where he was and started to feel better for about 2 minutes. Patient then fainted again and was able to regain consciousness with tactile and verbal stimulation. Medics were called for the patient. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was 80/55. When medics arrived, the patient had started to feel better and refused ER treatment. Medics left patient without doing vitals or assessments. Patient stayed at the vaccine clinic for another hour and then left after feeling better.

CMA noticed that continued to shake arm after 5 minutes but patient was alert and oriented x 3.  CMA thought the way he was shaking his arm seemed irregular so she advised pt he would be taken to an observation area for further observation.  Half way to the observation area, pt reported to CMA that he was seeing spots and felt like he was going to get sick.  CMA called for help.  Patient experienced a syncopal event just as he made it to the chair.  Several staff was helping to support patient.  Legs were lifted to another chair.  Patient was not responsive for a short time, very diaphoretic, breathing regular and unlabored.  Patients eyes then rolled upward toward the ceiling and patient&#39;s entire body began shaking uncontrollably while staff managed to keep patient from falling to floor from the chair.  Once patient was conscious, he was able to state his name but reported he was very confused and could not think clearly.  He was able to sit upright.  In the meantime while patient was shaking uncontrollably, staff sought urgent care provider to come and see patient.  Patient was then taken over to the urgent care side of the building to evaluate and treat patient.

Headache resolved within 24 hrs after which I was able to rest and recover, while having a low grade fever and minor fever on day 2 (48hrs). Total recovery took 3 days. The reason for reporting is that this headache was unusually severe and prevented me from sleeping, delaying recovery.

                                                Right arm became very sore the following day and remained extremely sore for about five days after receiving the first and final dose of the J&amp;J vaccine.  On the day following the injection, I began developing a headache.  I didn&#39;t think twice about it until the headache didn&#39;t go away on the second day, the third, the fourth, but finally the fifth day it seemed to subside.  The intensity was severe and was concerning due to how long it lasted.  I had simply assumed that it was normal side effects.  Yesterday on Monday, 04/12/2021, I developed severe and sharp pains in my stomach/abdomen that actually put me in bed all day.

                                                As soon as I woke up, I read the Janssen pause news from my bed. I got up to go to the bathroom and upon finishing, I felt my heart rate skyrocket and felt faint. I immediately went back to the bed where I lost consciousness. My wife said my eyes were open and my body was rigid. I came too within a minute of that and was breathing heavy and sweating and very fatigued. My wife had called 911 as I was coming back to consciousness. The EMTs checked my vitals and all was normal. They asked if I wanted to go to the hospital, and I said no. My back was extremely sore all day, and I developed small red spots around my eyes. I went to my doctor later that day and told them about it. They took my blood for tests, which I have not heard back about, and they did not conclude anything, but did set me up with an appointment for an MRI of my head, given my past history.

For about 30 minutes I saw a white spot on the peripheral  view of my left eye.  By Monday, I felt dizzy and bottom right part of my chest hurt when taking deep breaths. The dizziness and chest pain lasted all week, still feel feel it today 4-18. My doctors office told me vertigo was a common side effect. On Thursday 4-15 every time I bent down and tried to get up, my right leg hurt as if I had exercised. At the moment I haven?t gone into work since Monday 4/12 since my job requires a lot of physical work.  I have mostly been home  resting  but don?t feel ready to go back to work. If someone  calls can it be a Spanish speaking person please.

                                                Within maybe 20-30 minutes of vaccination, I noticed a small dull pain in my right calf;  I disregarded and walked back to the car.  This pain has reduced over the last week, but is still vaguely present.  5-6 hours after vaccination, headache and strong sinus-headache.  Laid down to rest.  I woke up around 20-30 minutes later with full body tremors and muscle spasms.  Muscle spasms particularly violent in my back, feeling similar to if someone was involuntarily using one of those muscle-stimulator elecrode pad systems on  me;  could feel each individual muscle tensing and releasing at random.  Tremors and spasms persisted and then diminished over the next 4-5 hours.   99.7F fever was recorded.   Chills, fever, nightsweats, and repeated sleepless rest/waking every 30-40 minutes until the next day.  Headache was still strong and present at 4am,  took 600mg ibuprofen and continued hydrating.  Headache, general soreness, and fever persisted for ~3 days, but manageable with hydration and rest.  On day 3 a rash appeared on both my knees/innerthigh just above the knee.  Likely not hives, subdermal red speckles that appeared at night;  close to 4mm in diameter, skin was warm to the touch and very itchy.  Most of the rash was gone by morning, and the itching and warmth was completely gone.  I have noticed a very similar rash appear on my front left collar/shoulder area just this morning, but no itch/warmth.  Outcomes: Muscle spasms/tremors subsided within a day. Fever/headache subsided within 3 days Knee/Thigh rash gone. More similar rash just appeared on upper left shoulder/collar. Upper calf dull pain still present, but only barely  &#34;It feels a bit off&#34; would be the best description.

He received the J&amp;J covid vaccine on 4/8 and felt well afterwards. Last Friday (4/16) he began to experience constitutional symptoms (fever to 100.4, chills, night sweats feeling drenched, decreased appetite) so decided to get his labs drawn as an outpatient for further evaluation. Symptoms progressed until Tuesday, when they began to subside slightly. At that point, his labs resulted and were notable for thrombocytopenia. He got his labs redrawn the day before admission and it was noted that his thrombocytopenia was worsening, so he was directed to the ED for further evaluation.  Patient seen by hematology, started on dexamethasone 40 mg PO daily as well as IVIG treatment x2. MRV of brain without evidence of dural venous sinus thrombosis  ***PATIENT CURRENTLY HOSPITALIZED***

                                                Within 12 hours of receiving the vaccine, around 2-3am, I began getting chills that lasted a couple of house. I had a temperature of 99.5 but immediately came down. In the early morning (the next day since receiving the vaccine), I felt nauseous followed by a headache. I also felt dizzy, but that immediately subsided. All of the mentioned side effects have subsided. My arm has been sore since receiving the vaccine but the pain has relatively minimized over time.

Felt basically normal by the time I left the facility and my arm has not been hurting since.   Approx 8:00 PM onset of headache, progressively worsening thru ~11:00 PM and plateauing. Headache was less by ~8:00 AM, and took Ibuprophin at 9:00 AM to further alleviate.   Approx 9:30-10:00 PM onset of chills and shivering, progressively worsening thru ~11:30 PM. Chills lasted through the night, but shivering stopped around 12:00 AM after turning the heat up and putting on more clothing, beanie, and blankets.   Fatigue is ongoing (as of now, ~22.5 hours after administration), but may be a result of poor sleep due to the chills overnight.

I drank Tylenol every 6 hours and drank lots of water for around 48 hours after symptoms started. Most of the symptoms went away after the 36-48 hour mark after starting. It?s been currently almost a week after the vaccine and still feel some joint, back pain and a light headache.

                                                Patient received vaccine around 3PM CST and proceeded to waiting area for the recommended waiting time. Within a few minutes of receiving the vaccination, around 3:05PM CST, patient complained of feeling dizzy. Patient was carefully laid down on the floor, given a pillow to protect his head, and feet were elevated. Patient was extremely sweaty and lightheaded/dizzy. Patient maintained consciousness and expressed that he was beginning to feel a bit better once he was lying down. He was provided a cold bottle of water if needed. Patient refused dispatching an ambulance, which I believed to be an acceptable option as he was already improving and never lost consciousness. A blood pressure cuff was obtained and his blood pressure was 138/94 pulse 69 at approximately 3:15PM EST. He did not know what his BP typically is, but I felt comfortable that he wouldn&#39;t likely pass out with this BP. He wanted to set up due to feeling better, so we cautiously helped him do so. After having him remain seated on the ground out of caution, he requested to stand up. He stated he was feeling much better and expressed at that point he wanted to leave. His girlfriend was with him and would be driving him home. It seemed that his symptoms had fully resolved by the time he left the waiting area and assured me he felt okay.

                                                After vaccination, patient appeared to be slouched over in chair in observation area.  Two bystanders approached him and held him to prevent him from falling from his chair. Patient was diaphoretic and eyes half-closed. Attempt was made to arouse patient by talking to him and rubbing chest. His head and body moved erratically for approx. 3 seconds.  Patient was lowered to the floor. Nurse continued speaking to patient and rubbing his chest.  He then opened his eyes and was startled. Patient abruptly sat up and said, ?what happened and where is my phone?? The nurse reassured him he was being taken care of and she asked if he knew where he was?  Patient replied, ?I have no idea.?  A paramedic approached and asked the patient if he knew his name.  The patient correctly replied. The patient had no recollection of what had taken place, but did know where he was. Patient was then evaluated by the paramedics.  All tests performed were normal and patient refused to be transported to hospital.  Patient was driven home by his wife.  Follow up phone call to patient yesterday evening with no answer.  Follow up phone call to wife (listed as emergency contact), 4/7 at approx. 6 pm.  Per wife, patient experiencing fatigue and still very pale. She said he just wasn?t himself. Patient was concerned that they did not know what to expect a week or two from now.   I advised patient that if she had concerns, she needed to have patient evaluated in ER.

I recovered well enough to drive home within 15 minutes afterwards. That night (10pm) I began shivering, which escalated to periods of convulsions, to which a mouth guard was needed to prevent chipping teeth and/or biting my tongue. There was no fever present, and to subside the uncontrollable shivering I sat in a very hot shower until motor functions gradually returned. Periods of headaches, joint pains and sweating ensued for the remainder of the night. There were no other symptoms in the following days.

                                                BLOOD CLOTS IN LEFT LUNG; TIRED; FEVERISH; This spontaneous report received from a consumer concerned a 34 year old male. The patient&#39;s weight was 175 pounds, height was 67 inches and Body mass index (NR: not provided) 27.4. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included non smoker, no personal or family history of clotting disorders and no recent trauma or travel. The patient was active and ran for 30 mins every day. The patient received COVID-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of administration not reported, batch number: 043AZ1A or 043A21A) frequency one total, dose was not reported, administered on 05-APR-2021 at 10:15 hours in left arm for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 05-APR-2021 in the evening, the patient experienced &#34;normal side effects&#34;, specifically tiredness and fever (temperature was not taken) and he took 2 Advil and went to bed. On 06-APR-2021 in the morning, he felt back to his normal baseline. On an unspecified date of APR-2021 (08-APR-2021 or 09-APR-2021), he felt pain and tightness in his chest and difficulty breathing. He noticed that he had to work harder to do his daily run. On 13-APR-2021, when the symptoms did not improve, he went to the emergency room. The patient had blood was taken (results not reported). A computerised tomography (CT) scan showed 2 blood clots in the left lung and duplex scans of both legs did not reveal a clot. A chest x-ray was done but results not provided. The patient&#39;s COVID-19 test was negative, and he was admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous heparin. It was reported that no oxygen was given. On 14-APR-2021, he was discharged with Eliquis which he should continue for 6 months.  On 16-APR-2021, the chest pain was gone, and his breathing was better in the morning but still difficult later in the day. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from tired, and feverish, and was recovering from blood clots in left lung. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This 34 year-old overweight male (BMI 27.4) was hospitalized for 2 blood clots in his left lung 8 days after receiving vaccination with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. He had no chronic medical conditions, was a nonsmoker, no personal or family history of clotting disorders, no recent trauma or travel, and exercised every day. On the evening of his vaccination, he felt tired and fever (temperature not taken) and took 2 ibuprofen and went to bed. The following morning, he felt back to normal. Two or three days later, he felt pain/tightness in his chest and difficulty breathing; he found it more difficult to perform his daily exercise. Eight days after vaccination, when his symptoms did not improve, he went to the emergency department where a CT scan showed 2 blood clots in his left lung. Covid-19 testing and duplex scans of his legs were negative. Blood tests were performed but results were unknown. He was hospitalized for 1 night, treated with IV heparin, and discharged the following day with apixaban. As of the time of this report, the chest pain had resolved and breathing was improved in the morning but still difficult later in the day. Based on the limited information (e.g. absence of blood test results), the relationship with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine is considered indeterminant.

I Went to bed and woke up at 16:25. 30 min later I slept again for about 90 min. Then I woke up and walked outside for some fresh air and got this extreme ice pick pain in the left side of my head for a few seconds. Then a few seconds later again. Now it just nags a bit behind my left eye and it feels a bit off in the left side of my brain. Bright lights hurt a bit. My back pain and Sciatica is also a lot higher than normal.

T&#43; 2 days - 7 days: fever subsides, hot flashes increase in intensity significantly, continuing to interfere with sleep. Other possible androgenic symptoms begin to arise: change in body odor, sex drive, motivations, appetite. T&#43; 7 days till current: previous symptoms of days 2-7 continue, extremely gradual onset headache begins one night. Making sure to rule out hydration and electrolyte imbalance expecting headache to be gone in the morning after sleep, I found that it was only worse and that an interpolation of the two pain points from when I went to sleep and woke up would have created a almost imperceptibly gradual but linear increase between the two points. The headache was of a type I had never had before, located in the center of my head just barely dorsal to the spinal insertion. It felt deeper than any headache I had had before which usually occur in the frontal lobe/neocortex zone. I do not regularly suffer headaches getting maybe a couple per year. Once I recognized androgenic involvement and the headache were continuing I took myself to the ER where I was evaluated and despite presenting with continuous hypertension and the symptoms mentioned above, I could not get them to perform a estrogen test and they let me leave with hypertension without any investigation. I&#39;m returning today to their urgent care facility to try again to get my estrogen levels checked. I had left a message on the phone line of VAERS prior to the original ER visit but had not heard back from anyone so I felt it was prudent to file a written report here.

I went home and alternated between 3000 MGs of Tylenol every 24 hours, 2400 MGs of Ibuprofen, 8 hours of 4% lidocaine patch and then off for 8 hours &#43; and a heating pad when the patch was off. The pain in my chest got worse and worse on Mon and Tue (started having spasms in the chest that caused extreme sharp shooting pain down my back up into my head) so went back into the ER Tues night.

                                                Patient was advised to remain in observation area for 30 minutes due to history of breathing difficulty with sulfa antibiotics in past. Shortly after being vaccinated the patient presented to our service window stating he did not feel well and was immediately escorted by the pharmacist to our administration area to have a seat. He stated he felt light headed, flushed (though not visibly), felt like his heart was racing, and was not having diffuculty breathing but felt like he couldn&#39;t catch his breath and stated he thought he was having a panic attack. He had stated before vaccination that he had not had a vaccine since his routing childhood schedule, his whole family had already had doses, and he had been putting it off because he was nervous. He insisted he needed some fresh air several times and was escorted outside by the pharmacist (with emergency supplies and a cell phone and within shouting distance of the pharmacy) for continued obsevation and was given water when requested. After a few minutes he stated he felt much better and the symptoms had resoved. He was directly observed outside per his request for the remainder of his waiting period and had no further symptoms. He was instructed to call the pharmacy right away if he had any additional symptoms after leaving.

Around 1700, fatigue returned. Took a 3 mile walk between 1700-1800. Consumed two beers @ 7% ABV between 1800-1845. Around 1830 began feeling tingling, chills and muscle and joint pain which continues. The pain is similar to DOMS that occurs after a robust workout; did not have a robust workout today. I&#39;m fully functional, able to eat and able to otherwise function, so the symptoms are manageable.

                                                Just before bed, about a week after getting the vaccine, I started to itch on my feet and arms. I fell asleep and woke up at about 3 AM with incredibly itchy skin from the tops of my feet all the way up to my shoulders. It was so itchy and uncomfortable that it woke me up. I took 2 Benadryl and put some anti-itch lotion on, and was able to fall asleep. I woke up the next morning feeling groggy, but better. The itch has not returned at all in the week since this happened.

                                                Terrible body aches starting at 8pm on April 1st.  Then had the chills.  Was able to take ibuprofen and slept for a bit.  Next morning April 2, got a migraine where it hurt to open my eyes.  Had that for about 2 hours then got better.  Also, I had trouble eating.  I would take a small bite of crackers and feel like I was going to throw up.  Took me a long time to eat a package of crackers and to drink 1 whole bottle of gatorade.  I took more ibuprofen through the day and that helped.  Around 5pm that night I was able to eat a little more and drink some with out feeling sick to my body.  Around 9pm that night headache came back and I went to bed for the night.  Today April 3 I feel a lot better.  Body still aches a bit and feels like I?ve been sick for 2 days so will probably take today and tomorrow to fully recoup.  No headache today.  Just small aches and tired.

                                                About 6/7 hours after the vaccination, I experienced fairly violent chills/shakes and the beginnings of a headache. I went to bed and woke some hours later with a 101-102-degree fever and muscle/joint aches (at the injection site on my left arm and throughout my body; I especially thought the joint aches in my legs and hands).  Now, about 27 hours after the vaccination, my fever has reduced to 99 degrees, my chills/shakes are gone, and my headache is mostly gone. The primary symptoms I have are the remaining sight fever, continued joint/muscle aches (mostly in my legs) and fatigue.

                                                Patient felt light-headed, then became unresponsive. He moved both arms halfway up, and they both quivered simultaneously. I called for help. One nurse raised his legs &amp; another put a pulse oximeter on patient &amp; took his BP. Patient started responding to verbal cues. A nurse gave him Gatorade to start drinking. He was drenched in sweat from head to feet. The nurse continued to take his BP, which did hit 120/~70, but then dipped again. Once his BP &amp; pulse stabilized, he was able to go home. Patient ate a full meal &amp; a non-diet soda. He reported being exhausted ~4 pm. He fell asleep &amp; rose once to urinate.  Dr. at a Family Medicine practice checked his heart and lungs, and confirmed this did not appear to be an allergic reaction, but more likely was a vagovasal reaction. Patient started reacting ~10 minutes after the injection.

Slept poorly all night due to body pains. Woke to muscle aches and slight join pains, which worsened throughout the day. Low grade temperature appeared at noon the day after the shot, and stayed into the night. Headache began around 5PM and got worse. Tylenol helped at 7PM. Slept from 7:30PM to 7:30AM. Felt back to normal by morning.

                                                I received vaccine about 4:00 PM. I felt fine until I went to bed about 10:30 P.M. I got extremely teeth chattering cold and could not get warm and began to have a small headache. I awoke about 2:30 A.M. and was extremely hot. I went downstairs to bathroom and the next thing I know my wife is shaking me to wake me up laying on the floor. My wife said she heard me fall and discovered me in the bathroom floor. She woke me up and I stood up and exited the bathroom and collapsed in the hallway. My wife awoke me again and I didn&#39;t know what occurred. My wife called 911 and EMS responded and assessed my condition. I explained everything that occurred and that I had my J&amp;J vaccine hours earlier.  My vitals were taken and my condition was evaluated. I had a bad headache that felt like my head was in a vise and my knees and chins hurting a bit from the fall I was fine. I just did not recall collapsing either time and I was distraught when my wife woke me both times. That&#39;s what I was informed by my wife. I don&#39;t recall anything after urinating to being woken up by my wife and I was on laying on the hallway floor and my wife was on the phone with 911.

The next day I had a very strong headache all day and couldn&#39;t get out of bed due to no energy, chills and body aches.  Was in bed sleeping on and off until 4:00pm, or roughly 24 hours after the shot.  Intermittent doses of Tylenol helped with symptoms to allow sleep.  After that 24 hours I felt substantially improved.

                                                At roughly 8 to 10 hours after injection I started developing a minor fever, fatigue, slight loss of appetite, lack of focus, chills and aches. Signs and symptoms continued to worsen throughout the night and next morning. Unable to sleep due to an increase in chills, fever progressed to 101.3F, developed a severe headache, aches were more prominent, same with fatigue. Loss of appetite went away. Started taking cold medication in the morning which either helped reduce the signs and symptoms or I had already experienced the apex of the adverse events. Fever was reduced, same with the aches and chills. Everything is fairly minor now, but the severe headache continued to to be present untill a second round of cold medication. Still fatigued when writing this at 9:30pm at night despite sleeping the majority of the day.

My left arm is extremely tingly, almost as if it?s asleep. As of this evening (4/18/21 around 7:30 PM), I am also experiencing this tingly sensation on the left of my face as well. It feels like pins and needles, and is very bizarre.  I?m extremely confident in saying it?s in direct correlation to the shot.  Please advise.

This is a 35-year-old male with complex past medical history including bilateral lung transplant and renal transplant performed several years ago.  He both of them and regarding his transplant management.  He is on immunosuppressive medications.  He is here today out of concern for exposure to COVID.  He was vaccinated with Johnson Johnson vaccine on  3/4.  He is here cause overnight he started developed fever headache sore throat muscle aches.  If continued through today.  He was test in the outpatient setting but the results have not yet returned.  He is here today with continued symptoms.  He is well-appearing on exam but mildly tachycardic, low-grade temperature here no significant increased work of breathing no conversational dyspnea lungs are clear heart is regular but tachycardic without murmur he has no signs or symptoms of DVT currently.  His chest x-ray shows all isolated left lower lobe infiltrate.  His labs are unremarkable with normal renal function, normal electrolytes but is rapid COVID test is positive.  Given his immunosuppressive status in infiltrate seen on x-ray initially recommended admission for observation even though he is not initially on any supplemental oxygen is work of breathing is quite comfortable.  I was able to discuss with his transplant surgeon In addition I talked to admitting physician who then discussed with pulmonology here .  In their opinion the best management for the patient would be to provide him with the monoclonal antibody treatment but this can only be performed in the outpatient setting given he has no increased work of breathing no supple ox requirement currently that he is stable for discharge.  He has a pulse monitor at home will also enroll him in a COVID home program.  Pulmonology will call him for follow-up tomorrow.  When I discussed with  they currently do not have any beds available at the hospital for transport.  The patient does not want to go to an outside facility that has a transplant team other than the risks of.  Ultimately the patient would like to go home.  I will add doxycycline for bacterial possibility of his pneumonia seen on x-ray today.  He also had very strict return precautions.  He understands likely had a possibility of worsening symptoms understands to return immediately if any new or worsening symptoms or no improvement.  Patient was given the monoclonal antibody treatment in the ER after ordered by Dr..  He will ultimately be discharged with very close follow-up.

                                                During the evening around 6pm after I started developing symptoms consistent with the flu.    Fever reached 104 around 8pm.  Uncontrollable chills also were present.  A severe headache followed.  I took fever reducing meds immediately. Confusion and trouble breathing happened during the fever and chills period.  An attempt to go to the hospital was unsuccessful because I lost consciousness while attempting to find phone/car keys.   After I woke up, I felt less confused and could catch my breath, so I decided to take more fever reducing meds and see how I felt in a few hours - this was around 11pm.  Around midnight my fever broke and the chills stopped, but the headache was at the worst it&#39;s been. The headache lasted the entire next day as well.      I wanted to go to the doctor, but was physically unable to and had no one to alert.  I do feel better today.  I have some weak headaches that come and go, along with muscle aches, but I feel that they are minor enough.

Went to get something to eat, walked half way and felt like I would fall on the ground, and returned to my room.  Called my parents because I wasn&#39;t sure if I would wake up the next morning. My team leader gave me a ride to the emergency room. They drew my blood and it was dark and thick.  They sent me home.  Still feel fatigue.

He started feeling sick and got up to go to the restroom. On his way to the restroom, he passed out and fell in the hallway. We then got him to a seat and gave him some water and orange juice. The patient was adamant that we not call an ambulance for him, so we made the patient stay seating under our direct supervision. He sat in the waiting room for about an hour until someone could come to pick him up. By the time someone arrived to take him home, he seemed to be doing much better.

                                                A patient received his vaccine and went over to sit in the waiting area.  A few minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient called me over to let me know he was feeling dizzy and felt like he was going to pass out.  I was able to have him lay on the floor and elevate his feet.  He was visibly sweating.  I got him an ice pack and put it on his forehead.  He never ended up losing conciousness and felt better after laying down for 5 min or so.  He eventually sat back up and stayed in the waiting area for a while longer to be monitored.  He eventually felt fine and went home.

Myalgia in legs happened immediately. No fever at this time.  Woke in morning with no fever, but muscle aches, malaise, lethargy, parasthesia were all present. Spent entire day in bed napping occasionally.  Measured temperature in evening at 100.7F.  Painful stomach pain happened in evening. Patient never gets acid pain or similar so this was very abnormal. Antacid helped but stomach pain continued all evening at a lesser degree.  When going to bed most symptoms had subsided. Still some parasthesia and Myalgia. Woke up on 4/9 feeling much better after lots of sleep.  No fever or other symptoms on morning of 4/9.

Day 3 two days post vaccine (12Apr2021) - headache like symptoms seem to have settled but still felt clammy / sweaty / hot.   Day 4 (13Apr2021) Injection site in left arm is still swollen and sore.

It started in my neck, moved up through my skull, and ended above my left eye. The feeling gradually improved with time, stretching, and acetaminophen. For more than 24 hours, a mild feeling persisted. On 4/13, the left side of my neck is still stiff and my left eye has a light throbbing.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine . I went to bed early, at 8:15pm. Within 5 minutes, I began to have uncontrollable chills. My body shivered and my teeth chattered like never before. I live in cold state and it was not a cold night, relatively speaking. I generally find cold nighttime weather easier to sleep in. I had to turn on a room heater, get fully dressed in warm clothes, and use an extra blanket and heating pad to warm up. Within 4 hours, I became warm. But, then I began to feel too warm, and my body went the opposite direction. Now, I was sweating. I took everything off.  That eventually stopped. Then I developed a head cold, at least that is how it felt. My nose became stuffy. This morning, I woke up at 5:30am and feel better.

                                                On the evening of 4/8/2021 at around 8 pm I began experiencing an upset stomach (felt like I might throw up) and then shaking in my stomach started and I got a lot of chills and a headache.  Then I spiked a very high fever and sweat like crazy.  I was shaking like crazy and had to call a doctor on call twice.  I had full body pain and was very sleepy.  The fever and chills lasted a bit over 2 days but unfortunately the pain  in my body had not gone away.  Currently (4/14/2021) I have pain in all my joints and my neck and back and I noticed a rash around my right knee. I have felt very tired. I have felt some mild shortness of breath, which may be seasonal allergies (discussed with a nurse earlier, my oxygen levels are 98 percent today, so I am breathing fine, but there is a sensation of shortness of breath) . I have consulted my primary care office about the above and they are speaking to the doctor.  I am trying to limit my exposure to any hospital setting until the 14 days (2 weeks) is up from the vaccine.  Hopefully these symptoms will go away soon and hopefully none are related to a blood clot issue.  We&#39;ll see if my doctor or you guys may recommend a future platelet test?

                                                Two days following vaccination I started having tingling in my feet.  Often it felt like pins and needles, and eventually more like a burning sensation.  My understanding is generally we would refer to this as neuropathy.  It comes and goes in my hands as well.  I&#39;ve had some significant leg pain in my hip off and on, and a couple of headaches, but the consistent for more than  two weeks has been the neuropathy issue and it is not going away.

                                                A healthcare worker was setting up and approached me and asked if I wanted a free J&amp;J vaccine. I was very hesitant . I told him that I had a flight later that night and didn?t want to have any side effects on the plane.  He assured me hardly anyone ever has bad reactions to it and was very salesy, not seeming concerned much for my health or my questions, more like he needed to meet a quota. Against my better judgment, I got the shot and was absolutely miserable on the flight and that whole night. I developed a fever, body aches, headache, chills, and fatigue around 8 hrs after receiving my shot. It was one of the worst nights of my life with a fever reaching 103.5, and that was with Tylenol in my system to try to keep the fever down.  I didn?t feel normal for 3 days.

Patient called our OP line on 04/17 complaining of fever of 102 and chills. He was instructed to go to local lab and get labs done. They drew basic labs as well as blood cultures. On Sunday, the patient reported his fever was gone and he felt better. Today, he was feeling SOB and presented to his PCP. They ordered a CTA which reportedly showed bilateral PEs. They sent him to the local ED who transferred him here. Of note, his INR has been supratherapeutic for several weeks and pharmacy has been adjusting his warfarin dosing. The patient tested COVID negative prior to transfer. The vaccine lot number information is not accessible to this reporter.

The top half of my spine has discomfort at its best and mild/modern pain the rest of the time. It&#39;s constant. At times my spine feels cold and tingly. Then my entire core gets cold and tingly. I&#39;ve never had back pain or injured my back. This pain is directly related to the vaccine and my experience seems to be outside the norm of side effects subsiding after a couple days.

                                                For 2 days, typical arm soreness, flu-like symptoms with significant muscle pain and general weakness and malaise. However, on the 5th day, EXTREME abdominal pain, left side. Pain level up to 9. Incapacitating. Two visits to urgent care. This was in March before any info came out about adverse blood clot events for the J&amp;J vaccine, so the doctors were not really interested at the time that I had just gotten my shot. They gave me antibiotics, thinking it may be diverticulitis (diagnosis based on symptoms only - no diagnostics - it was the doctor&#39;s &#34;best guess&#34;). Pain did not subside, only got worse. 4 days later I could barely move, abdominal pain was extreme. Went back to clinic and they did a PET scan to check for diverticulitis. There was none; PET scan revealed nothing out of the ordinary. So they told me they had no idea what it was and sent me home. PET scan reading by the doctor notes specifically that blood/vascular was not able to be observed because no contrast or dyes were used. Bottom line was over 10 days of extreme abdominal pain 5 days after receiving the shot. I&#39;ve never experienced anything like that before.

                                                I received my vaccine this morning at 6:12AM and felt fine after. Around 7:45AM I started to feel slightly short of breathe, but figured it was just from the cold outside and my Asthma. The shortness of breathe feeling goes away. Later in the day sometime after 3 PM, I start to feel as if I am getting stuffy. I take a nap on the buss on my way home, and when I wake up I suddenly feel like I am freezing and have chills all throughout my body. I get home and jump in a hot shower to warm up, but it did not help. I then heat up some food to eat dinner, and I go to drink some soda, and I notice I have no taste. I figured the soda was flat, but even flat soda has some taste to it. I then drink a Cherry Gatorade, and still no taste. Now I check my temperature and it is at 101.4, and I have a slight cough.

                                                I started to feel extreme fatigue around noon the day after but what I found very concerning is I lost probably 80-90% of the strength in my arms.  I couldn&#39;t palm a ball i had for the kids which i normally can easily.  I had chills and nausea as well.    I can&#39;t really remember much from that day and it feels like a big blur.  I woke up the next day feeling very irritable with brain fog.  Today its gotten better and I am hoping tomorrow I will be back to normal.

                                                Patient came in for Janssen COVID vaccine that was scheduled electronically online.  All appropriate prescreening was done and patient had no previous allergies or issues.  Patient was instructed to sit in one of the chairs designated for post vaccine observation.  Within minutes (less than 3), patient was very dizzy, clammy (cold sweats), pale and said he did not feel right.  I assisted him to a sitting position on the floor from his chair and we were able to ease him back to a lying down position from there with his head on the floor and feet elevated above heart on a chair.  Patient said that the cold floor actually made him feel better instantly.  At 4:18pm after lying down for about 3 minutes we checked his blood pressure with him still lying down.  It was 110/88 and pulse of 104 (so slightly elevated pulse).  He said he was feeling better and we kept him lying down.  Patient&#39;s wife was also there so she was able to provide information in addition to him doing it also.  She did state that he occasionally had panic attacks and she thought this might be one, the patient was adamant that it was not.  At 4:24 pm we checked his blood pressure again and it was 100/90 and Pulse of 104.  He was feeling quite a bit better so we had him come to a sitting position on the floor and he had not eaten in a while so we got him a granola bar and water.  Pt slowly ate these and begin to feel clammy and sweaty again within 3-4 minutes. We checked his blood pressure again and it was 104/90 and pulse of 100.  He wanted to stay sitting to see if it would pass.  We did continuously observe injection site and screen for any other symptoms of an allergic reaction (nausea, cramping, swelling, and none of these were occurring). Since he was still not feeling well we gave the patient 50mg of benadryl (20 mls of 12.5mg/5ml liquid benadryl) with his approval. After about 10 minutes of sitting total he was still having cold sweats and feeling dizzy so we had him lie back on his back with his feet elevated while the benadryl kicked in.  By 4:50pm he was feeling well enough to sit back up and we got him some wraps and a coke from the cafe to eat.  Pt continued to consistently improve and was ready to leave about 5:20pm.  We advised him and his wife of signs and symptoms of allergic reaction and to have those treated to immediately at urgent care or and ER.   We also told him to follow-up with his PCP.  I had a manager help walk them to their car.  They were very kind and grateful.  I will follow-up with a call tomorrow and again on Friday to make sure he continues to do well.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received my dose at 3pm on March 12, and experienced no adverse events until about 5 or 6 hours later. Between 8pm and 9pm, I felt a bit tired, though wasn?t sure it was vaccine-related at first. However, I shortly afterwards started feeling much more tired, and experienced chills and shivering. I went to sleep. My wife later said I felt very warm, though we did not measure my temperature.  During the night, at one point, I got up to go to the bathroom, and became very dizzy and nearly fell over, though I was able to catch myself and did not experience any fall or injury.   I went back to bed. At some other point during the night, I started sweating. My wife later said I felt cold at that point.  For most of the following day, Saturday, March 13, I no longer felt dizzy nor overly hot or cold, but had a migraine and mild nausea. I did not vomit, but I also ate very little during the day. I did eat a little in the morning, and had some water throughout the day. For the most part, I laid in bed, drifting in and out of sleep.   At about 7pm on March 13, I took two Tylenol to try to fight the headache. By 8pm I felt almost completely better. I ate more bits of food, and have felt fine since then. Sunday, I woke up and felt back to normal. I ate normally as well.

                                                Started feeling tired and drained around 10pm the same day of receiving the vaccine and then after going to bed around 11pm I felt body aches, chills, and I assume I had a fever. I could simply not get warm or comfortable and tossed and turned for hours. Felt like I had the flu. Finally fell asleep around 2am. Woke up the next morning around 6:30am and took Tylenol but no longer had a fever or chills. I felt drained and tired throughout the whole next day but unsure if that was vaccine related or simply due to lack of sleep. Slept fine that evening and had no other effects.

Then progressed to severe shaking chills, fevers, headaches, tingling/electric shock feeling in back of head/neck, muscle aches, mild joint pain, eye discomfort associated with the headaches, poor appetite at first, trouble sleeping, and fatigue; all of which required doses of Tylenol and ibuprofen and cold packs. Symptoms lasted all night and fever broke overnight after finally falling asleep. The next day (3/17) took some more Tylenol and ibuprofen, but the fever and chills subsided. The other symptoms mostly resolved except was still quite tired and felt weak. Also, had cold sweats all day on 3/17. By around 3/18 most all of the symptoms resolved.  Also, had mild soreness at vaccination site throughout.  I?m a physician. If I wasn?t a physician I may have sought medical attention.

One week ago, on Friday, March 26, he received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine for Covid 19. That day he felt fine. The following day he had some muscle aches. Sunday he states he had some slight shortness of breath, only for that day. Then he had some fever and chills feeling. That resolved. The only symptoms that persisted was his muscle aching and tightness. Then yesterday, the day of his presentation to the ER, he noted some bilateral lower extremity edema which prompted his visit. He is feeling mostly fine except a bit of muscle tightness. BNP was 154. Chest x-ray showed pneumonitis. He received antibiotics. Echocardiogram was completed showing preliminary findings of small to moderate pericardial effusion and trace aortic insufficiency.  Will treat with colchicine and ibuprofen.

                                                JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE EUA  I received the vaccine on 3rd April, 2021, at approximately 9:30 am. There were no immediate side effects. Approximately 10 hours later I began to feel EXTREME cold and chills. So much so that I had to put on 3 layers of clothing, socks and cover myself with 3-4 blankets. I also experienced a fever and body soreness. My wife tended to me with two ibuprofen tablets, 200 mg each and continually to put cold presses on my forehead. I drank a lot of water but my fever continued to spike to 102.8. The symptoms continued for another 3 hours. Out of concern we called the emergency room to ask if we should be concerned about the fever. We were advised to take two Tylenol tablets. My wife gave me two Tylenol PM tablets. About 30 mins after taking the Tylenol tablets and continuing to hydrate, my cold and chills began to subside and I began to shed all of my layers. About 30 minutes after that, my fever levelled out to abougt 100.8. Then I passed out. The following morning, I woke up with cold, chills and fever gone. I had a mild headache and took 2 Extra Strength Tylenol tablets. It&#39;s been four hours since then and I feel fine, just a little weak.

                                                Starting at 11 PM (roughly 7 hours after injection), I developed severe flu-like symptoms.  Fever, nausea, chills, and headache.  I was unable to sleep for most of the night.  I had a fever of over 100 degrees.  The symptoms were the worst from 11 PM - 4 AM.  They persisted throughout the next day (thus far), but have lessened in severity.  They are still present, however, 28 hours after initial injection - although roughly 50% less severe.  Acetaminophen seems to help.

                                                Patient was waiting in designated waiting are following vaccine administration. About 5 minutes after vaccine I heard wife calling for help. When I went out to assess patient I found him laying back in chair with his head back, shaking, eyes open, and making fists with his hands. I asked him if he wanted me to call 911. He was able to respnd through clenched teeth that he felt very strange and to call 911. He remained conscious and knew his name. We contacted 911 and I supported pt from opposite side of wife. After a few minutes he calmed down and asked for water, he appeared to be sweating around head area. He took a few sips of water until operator on phone asked us to withhold further liquid until EMTS arrived. He was completely back to normal status within 5 minutes, EMTS came and assessed pt and allowed him to leave of his own accord. After the incident her relayed that similar reactions including full fainting spells have occurred to him in the past when receiving vaccines. this was not indicated on his intake form

                                                Patient was administered the COVID vaccine and felt fine.  He relocated to our pharmacy waiting area for observation.  Once there he started to read the provided material (EUA, V-Safe) and started to feel anxious.  He said the next thing he knew he was sweating and had tunnel vision.  He wasn&#39;t 100% sure he passed out.  A fellow associate helped him to the ground and elevated his feet.  We got ice for behind his neck, and a cold cloth for his forehead.  We took his blood pressure and it started to come back up.  He waited for about 30 minutes before leaving.  His color had returned and he stated he felt fine.

By about 10am the shivering/chills had subsided enough to be able to get out of bed and get Tylenol for the headache. This helped get some sleep. At about 1pm was the first time I checked my temperature and it read 102 orally. By this point the sore muscles had mostly subsided, but the headache and fever persisted until almost 11pm on the dot. The fever dropped from 102 to normal in under an hour.

While attempting to go to the bathroom, I must have passed out because I woke up some time later on the floor with a busted face and nose, and a severe headache.  Initially the day after the shot, I had sharp shooting pains down my right leg. I have also had a headache on more days since getting the vaccine.  Mental fog and tiredness is also occurring a few days after the initial shot.

Started with shortness of breath and asthma exacerbation symptoms on 4/1/21; saw PCP, on 4/2/21 for shortness of breath and asthma/allergy-like symptoms. He also reports that since the time of his vaccine his BP has been running slightly high around 140/85 and headaches have continued off and on. He was started on Budenoside inhaler by PCP and prednisone (patient does not recall dose). Came to see me at on-site clinic on 4/13/21 for continued headaches and concerns to blood pressure elevation persistence

                                                The evening after the shot, I felt common side effects like headache, lack of energy, weakness, fever, chills, body aches, and inflammation. But my skin was also very sensitive to the touch. Upon 100% recovery from the common side effects on Monday, April 19, my skin sensitivity went away but was replaced with intense itchiness that has continued and gotten more intense since then to this day (Wed.). I am developing a few small welts on hands and feet. So far, my symptoms are very mild and not alarming, but are noticeable and bothersome. I do hope they will go away soon. I thought you should know about the skin issue since I have not seen it reported anywhere this far after the shot.

                                                The night of the 9th, I had injection site pain. That lasted for three days, at least. Significant pain but it didn&#39;t stop  me from work. It wasn&#39;t consistent pain - I was having trouble getting my arm up. Thursday, - 18th - I suddenly felt tired and feverish. I did a PCR test on the evening of the 18th. Then there was fever between 98.9 - 100.4. I had cough and sore throat and I had runny nose. The fever kind of subsided after I took Tylenol on the 18th and then again 19th and 20th, as well. My COVID result was negative. I made an emergency report on the 19th with my doctor. I had a virtual appt with her. She was under the opinion that it was a bacterial infection or allergic reaction. When I took - Levocedrizine - my runny nose symptoms got a little better. On 19th, she prescribed me Erythromycin - I took the full course. of that and my fever left the Sunday after I started that. I finished the full course of it by Tuesday. I still had a cough but I did not have any other symptoms after the course of medication (five days- I took two the first day and then one of the next four days after that) was finished. Note: I use CPAP at night. My cough took some time to subside - it probably subsided by the 26th.

Left side of face was left numb. I quickly did a neuro check; I could move fingers, eyes, etc. I called nurse and told to go to the ER.  At the ER, Covid test; neg, CT scan, MRI, blood work; all normal. Something happened to the nerve on that side of my face, trigeminal nerve.  It took a couple days for the numbness to dissipate. But I do still have some pain on the L side of my face.  Told to follow up with PCM; scheduled for 429/2021

                                                About 9 hours after receiving the vaccine I began developing flu-like symptoms, which quickly escalated. Within a couple of hours I developed a very high fever (which peaked at 104.1 and hovered around 102-103), body-wracking cold chills, extreme lethargy and body aches. The only thing that kept my fever down was 1,000mg of Tylenol every 6 hours, with a cold compress on my head. The symptoms were less severe but still substantial by the following day. On the second night after receiving the vaccine (Monday the 8th) I had nightsweats, but then woke up on the morning of Tuesday the 9th feeling almost completely back to normal. The only other strange thing to happen was waking up today on Thursday the 11th with a giant fever blister on my lip, which I suppose could be attributed to an immune system in temporary disarray or overdrive. I am still very grateful for the vaccine and would do it again, but it was very scary that first night on Sunday the 7th. I don&#39;t remember the last time I felt that sick.

Temperature held at 101.5 until about 12:30am then fluctuated between 101 and 101.5 for a few hours. Then slowly decreased. At about 9:30am was the first time my temperature was under 100°.  It was 99.8. As my fever went down my headache increased to moderate/severe level. I took some acetaminophen at 12:00pm for my headache, my temp was 99.1°.

                                                On Saturday 3/20 I experienced the usual symptoms that were noted. On Monday 3/22 I began to get very dizzy with a heart rate of 150bpm. My blood pressure went up to 210/138 which is extremely abnormal for me. I began to tremor uncontrollably. I thought it was an anxiety attack so I took my Xanax. .50mg. That did not work at all. I experienced nausea and stomach pain. I called 911 and was taken to the hospital where after 4 hours I started feeling better. Tuesday I continued to have tremors. Wednesday the rapid heart rate, stomach pain, and nausea returned. The rest of the week did not get any better. On Saturday 3/27 I slept all day long which again is not normal for me at all. At this point we are 1 full week into the vaccine administration. On Sunday 3/28 I bagan to have the same feeling as the prior Tuesday. Sweating, couldn&#39;t breath, heart rate hit 170 this time. BP was the same, tremors, stomach pain, nausea, dizzyness, and this time my Carbon Dioxide level dropped to 24. This morning 3/29 I woke up with extreme tremors. No dizzyness.

Pt then laid back in the chair and became unresponsive, but still conscious. Pharmacy team, moved patient to the floor, where he immediately became responsive and color came back to skin. It is noted that the patient was sweating at the time of the event, and he stated he does not do well with shots. All of this took place within 15 minutes of receiving the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine.

The chills grew to be severe by about 8 hours post-vaccine and I had a fever of 100.5F.  Fever eventually got to 101.0 F with severe chills.  My fever and chills subsided about 18 hours post-vaccine and was replaced with moderate-to-severe headache.  I took 500 mg Tylenol and headache subsided.  I am now 24 hours post-vaccine and feel only mild lethargy but otherwise good.  A rough few hours but happy to have the vaccine!

                                                The evening after I received my vaccine I became very cold and couldn&#39;t get warm, to the point of shivering very hard, while at the same time having a fever of 102 F (about 9:30 pm).  The house was 68 F, and I bundled up with thermal underwear, fleece pajamas, a robe, and two extra blankets, but I couldn&#39;t stop feeling cold.  My body was painfully sore the rest of the night; this may have been a reaction from shivering so hard and wearing my muscles out.  Later that night, I woke up in a sweat (maybe 11:30pm) and had to strip out of my clothes down to my underwear, and I couldn&#39;t stop feeling warm.  I slept the rest of the night on top of the covers, and woke up very frequently, probably every half hour.  Each time I woke, I drank half a glass of water (about 6 oz).  The next day my fever was gone and I felt normal temperature wise, but my muscles were all very sore.  I had flu-like symptoms for about a week, a little bit less each day.  It was probably a full week later until I felt normal.

                                                Within approximately five minutes of injection, I experienced increased sweating, light headedness, and difficulty seeing  until I passed out unconscious for a minute or two.  When I awoke I was still sweating and cold for the next five to ten minutes.  Paramedics checked my vital signs onsite afterwards (blood pressure, sugar levels, and pulse) and everything appeared to be normal.  I was able to drive home 30 minutes later after making sure that all side effects subsided.  I have not experienced any other side effects from the vaccine.

                                                Hi I was vaccinated Thursday April 8th 2021 at approximately 9:15am. I kept a log so I could share my experience with my friends and family. After vaccination I was fine for a few hours but I randomly got a case of  watery eyes that would last about 15 minutes and then clear up. This happened 4 times over a 9 hour period. Around 9 hours after vaccination I started to feel like I had a cold and my skin all over my body ached to touch and my heart started racing. I felt sunburned and nauseous and went to bed. 13 hours exactly after vaccination I was hit hard with intense chills to the point of teeth chattering and full body shivering. 15 hours after injection I woke up intensely hot and I had a massive headache, full body pain, a tickle deep in my lungs that made me cough, nausea, and a fever of 101. I also was having extreme heart palpitations. I have a laser thermometer and I discovered my fever was 101.5 at my forehead but my neck and chest were 103. I took ibuprofen and kept patting myself with cold wet wash cloths to combat the fever. At this point I debated going to the hospital. I had intense fatigue and I was too weak to move but too sick to sleep. This level of fever and symptoms went on for about a day and a half. Since my vaccination I am still fatigued, I get winded very easily, something small like feeding my dog makes me break out in a sweat, and I need to lay down. I am still weak and fatigued but not to the same level as before and it changes every day. I have a sore throat, headaches, occasionally my body will twitch in random places, fever will pop up and go away, I cough gag and get very weak under any physical stress. I did not have injection site pain out of the ordinary until 48 hours after injection and it felt like a shotgun blast to the arm.. I did have very unusual joint pain from the start. I was injected in my upper left arm, but my lower right ankle was painful and my left wrist...    I am a 38 year old male with treated hypertension, obesity and sleep apnea. My mother who is 65 was vaccinated at the same time as myself and her symptoms were slow onset and much milder than mine but she too has headaches, upset stomach, fatigue, watery eyes, fever, chills, twitches, injection pain, etc.

                                                I experienced mainly a strong headache. I waited until approximately 24 hours after the shot to take anything for it. I treated with OTC pain reliever OTC extra strength Tylenol 500MG x 2. Repeated this approx 6 hours later again taking 500MG x2. After 2 doses I felt good enough and discontinued taking anything beyond that.

Started to feel achy and a twinge in chest around 12:30 am, went to sleep, woke up at 2 am with severe stabbing pains in chest that would come and go. Took some Advil around 3:15am and within a half hour flu like symptoms stopped but not chest pains. The chest pain were less severe. Continues to feel a  slight twinge and slight aching in chest 4 days later.

I was awake for 6 hours in the night with intense chills, sweating, and a temperature of at least 102.  I was unable to take Tylenol until having the chills for 9 hours.  Tylenol helped.  I slept about 20 hours the first day with a fever all day.  I had a fever for about 24 hours.  The following week I was completely exhausted and slept about 12 hours a day.  I am 38 years old and this was the sickest I have been in probably 20 years.  It was bad and that&#39;s why I am reporting it.  I am very thankful to have had the vaccine though.  Thank you all for what you do!

                                                On April 8, 2021, I received the J&amp;J vaccine. Initially, I only had the chills and body aches. Then, on Monday April 12, 2021, I went to the gym where I worked out. When I came home and after showering, I returned a phone call shortly after 8 P.M. While speaking on the phone, I could tell after a few minutes of talking something was off, and then all of a sudden, the words stopped coming out. After a few more seconds, I was trying to yell upstairs to my wife for help. I sounded like a goat while trying to yell that word. I then snapped out of it, and was able to speak clearly and normal again. I told my wife and called back my friend. My friend said I sounded like I was getting sick when I had the attack. The next morning I went to the hospital. I was diagnosed with a Transient Ischemic Attack &#34;TIA.&#34;

About a day or two later, I developed a chronic cough that is still currently persisting.  After seeing my doctor on Sat 4/17, I was prescribed an Albuterol inhaler for asthma, which has been dormant for years.   The coughing is continuous, and at times strong/violent.  On the morning of Tues 4/20 I had coughed up a little bit of blood after the coughing had persisted for about 5 or 10 minutes.  Asthma, chronic cough, and  coughing up blood are not typical/documented side effects of received the Covid vaccine.  My asthma has been dormant for years, and prior to this event, I have not had instances of chronic cough or coughing up blood.

The next morning, I felt very tired walking up stairs from the basement to my room on the 2nd floor..barely made it to the 2nd floor, felt like my body hitting a wall/ no energy to lift my legs up. I made to my bedroom but felt very dizzy, using my hands holding myself up on my desk and realized I might faint any seconds..my vision was bright and blurry. I slowly moved myself to a bed and laid down for a while. Later that day in the late afternoon, my muscles were sore (legs, thighs, back) I could not walk more than 10-15 steps which I needed rest. These conditions lasted me for 6 days since receiving the vaccine and felt better on the 7th day. Currently I&#39;m ok.

I retire around 12-1 a.m. and consistently awake between 4 and 6 a.m., unable to fall back asleep. This has led to serious drowsiness during the day. Prior to the vaccine, I would regularly sleep until 8 or 9 a.m.  uninterrupted.

                                                I had a severe headache starting in the evening. The pain was constant, dull, and felt like it was coming from the center of the head. I don&#39;t have a history of headaches, so this was unusual. After going to bed at 11PM, I woke up around 2AM from the intense pain. I could not sleep for a couple of hours in the night and I took Nyquil, which helped a little bit. I considered going to the emergency room, but decided to wait until morning to make the decision. I was able to go back to sleep and then slept until 11AM. I woke up feeling weak and groggy, although it may have been due to the Nyquil. The headache was improved and gradually diminished throughout the day. The next morning, it was completely gone and I felt back to normal.

                                                On 04-16-2021 I experienced I could feel tingling sensation on my let arm and face, lasting couple of hours. Earlier that night, I woke up I was cold, my temperature was 99.F.  For the rest of the week of Friday morning wok up with headaches, focused at temple, left side of my head. I still had some tingling to my left arm radiating to my left pinky finger. My tingling sensation and headaches come and go and come back again on and off.  I went to see a physician 04-23-2021 and did blood work which was negative. On 04-28-2021 I saw a neurologist on 04-28-2021. I have had this tingling sensation to my body before due to a parasite, previous history. She states that it sounded that the vaccine caused a flare up t my body and recommend treatment steroid injections to my temples and neck. She states this injections work about 70% of the time. She also prescribed muscle relaxer and take Vitamin D complex. Herdiagnosis was related to nerve damage due to the flare up.

                                                I went to bed around 10:30 and felt completely normal.  Around 1AM I woke up with the chills that lasted for about an hour or so.  I could not get warm.  My body would go from hot to cold and shiver/spasm in a pattern that lasted about a minute or so.  this pattern of hot cold and shiver/spasm lasted approximately an hour.    when that subsided I started to experience relatively extreme fever and flu symptoms.  I completely sweat through my pajamas.  My entire body ached and hurt like a normal fever flu but more extreme.  Around 2:30AM I took three 500mg acetaminophen, 2 mg Xanax and a 10 mg Valium.  I fell back asleep some time between 3:30 and 4:00AM.  I woke up at 8:30 with most of the symptoms having dissipated.  It&#39;s now 10AM.  I still feel groggy and a little achy in my body, but the fever seems to have subsided.  For now that is about it

He continued to have labored breathing and starting sweating. We were monitoring him and he informed us that it was anxiety related. He couldn&#39;t move his hands and started blacking out. When EMT arrived he started to feel better. They were able to rule out an allergic reaction and it was most likely anxiety related. Patient refused to go to the hospital and was walked out by EMT to make sure he could drive home.

On Sat, May 1, I had an afib episode in the morning. Reset to sinus rhythm the next morning around 2:30am. I spoke with you during the episode.   3. On Mon, May 3, I had brain fog. I?m usually tired after an afib episode. But this seemed different. I?ve never experienced something like this before. But I chalked it out to the after effects of the afib and moved on. 4. On Fri, May 7, I started having the stiffness in my right calf. I checked in with you that weekend to make sure it wasn?t a clot. After we spoke I think we ruled out a clot.  5. In addition, I?ve developed some added symptoms since then: (i) Sweaty feet. (ii) Pins and needles sensation in feet.  (iii) Tightness in the arch of the right foot. (iv) Feet and hands feel sensitive to cold.  (v) Burning sensation in feet and left hand.  (vi) Mild headache mostly felt in the left temple.  (vii) A pulling feeling on the left side of the face. (viii) A feeling that if I close my eyes, I may faint.

THE VACCINE WAS GIVEN WITHOUT INCIDENT AND PATIENT SAID HE FELT OK. HE TRADED PLACES WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AND SAT IN A CHAIR IN THE EXAM ROOM. IT WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER I HAD ALREADY GIVEN HIS GIRLFRIEND HER VACCINE THAT HE SAID THAT HE WAS FEELING FUNNY. HIS COLORING CHANGED AND HE WAS DIAPHORETIC. I GOT A PAPERTOWEL WITH COOL WATER ON IT AND PLACED ON HIS NECK AND ANOTHER ONE FOR HIS FOREHEAD. AFTER A MINUTE OR SO, HE DID PASS OUT WHILE IN THE CHAIR. HE WAS OUT FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS AND THEN CAME BACK TO AND WAS ALERT AND ORIENTED X 4 BUT STILL FELT VERY WEAK. I GAVE HIM A WATER TO SIP ON. HIS GIRLFRIEND STAYED AT HIS SIDE THE WHOLE TIME. HIS O2 WAS 100% AND HIS PULSE 53. HE SAID THAT HE HAD EATEN SHORTLY BEFORE COMING TO GET HIS VACCINE BUT THEN LATER ASKED FOR AN APPLE BECAUSE HE WAS ON A CLEANSE DIET AND REALLY HAD NOT EATTEN MUCH. THE PCT WENT TO GET HIM AN APPLE. AFTER EATING THE APPLE AND SITTING FOR AN ADDITIONAL 20 MIN HE FELT WELL ENOUGH TO LEAVE. STILL WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AND HIS GIRLFRIEND COMMITTED TO DRIVING HIM SO HE DID NOT HAVE TO. HE LEFT WITH NO ASSISTANCE.

I looked at my toes and noticed they were turning very pale.  One minute later the bottoms of my feet started turning yellow and within one more minute the bottoms of my feet souls were completely yellow. I have never had this reaction before. It was shocking and looked like I had stepped in yellow paint.

                                                Pt had history of anaphylaxis related to bee stings. We asked if he had ever had a reaction to another vaccine and he said no. Pt came up saying he wasn&#39;t feeling well during the observation period, within about 5-10 minutes after receiving the vaccination. He look very pale and clammy. I asked if he was ok and he shook his head. Tried to grab a chair for him and he started to collapse. With some help I was able to get him to the ground without injury. We called 911 and I grabbed an epipen. I tried to assess the patient, and he was unable to tell me if he was having any trouble breathing or if his lips/mouth/tongue was swelling. He was conscious but couldn&#39;t speak coherently. I administered the epipen to his right lateral thigh due to his history of anaphylaxis with bee stings. We were able to lay him down while waiting for the ambulance. His color started to return and he was able to respond to questions, but was still slightly confused. He did tell me at this point that he has had similar reactions after vaccines and blood work. The paramedics arrived and took the patients vitals and took him to the hospital.

                                                Within a few minutes of receiving the vaccination I lost consciousness. It was a drive-through vaccination clinic by the Health department. My vehicle rolled into a cement and metal bar/side of the building&#39;s exit at a slow speed. The EMS at the scene stated that my heartbeat was irregular, varying between bradycardia and tachycardia. When they checked my blood pressure inside the ambulance they stated it was very low. About 15-20 minutes later I tried to sit up and was still unstable and unable to keep myself upright without assistance. I was then taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital&#39;s emergency department. Nothing notable or unusual was found when I was checked out there. Within a couple hours I felt well enough to go home. Once home I had a headache, fatigue, mild dizziness, and nausea with physical activity. The following day I had a headache, muscle aches, pain at the injection site, and nausea with extended physical activity. Today I have pain in the arm where I received the vaccine and a mild headache.

At around 2am April 11 I went to use the bathroom and blacked out. My wife found me on the floor and was able to rouse me. Went to the ER with severe stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea, severe headache, fever, high pulse of 120-140bpm. Pulse dropped to 108bpm by the time i got to te hospital. Hospital administered Zofran for my gastro issues and ran an EKG. We waited 3&#43; hours and never saw a doctor and was never even taken back in the ER. We left due to staff and patients in the waiting room not wearing respirators or masks or even basic sanitary precautions or separation of patients with Covid symptoms from other patients.

                                                10 hours after my shot I had moderate to severe chills with pains that moved around my body. Pain would go from deep pain in my leg, to hands, to feet.  Not ache like the flu, but piercing pain.  Head ache as well. This first round lasted for 1 hour and 36 minutes.  Then, a break for almost two hours. Following that break, the next 12 hours i was achy throughout my body, headache that would come and go and very fatigued.  I was only able to get out of bed for roughly 2 hours during that 12 hour stretch. Following this I ended up getting a fever later that night that lasted for about 2 hours (100.5 at the highest).    Since that night I have had pain daily throughout my body.  They are quick, sometime sharp pains in my head, and various muscles throughout my body. I have also had deep pains as well that have come and go in random muscles in my body.

About 20hrs after receiving the shot I started to run a low grade fever floating from 99.5-100.5F; I normally average around 97.5-98F. Thursday night/Friday morning I had the most prolonged fever break I&#39;ve ever had; my entire bed was soaked.  Fever was gone by Friday sunrise.   Saturday I experienced a sever headache, stomach ache and in the evening shortness of breath. I felt extremely light headed. All symptoms cleared by Sunday.   I just drank plenty of fluids and rested as much as possible.

                                                This was one of the worst headaches I&#39;ve ever had in my life. Migraine headaches run in my family so I&#39;m no stranger to them, which is why it is particularly surprising. Along with the headache I had severe flu symptoms - body ache from head to toe, legs toward the end. Abdominal pain toward end. I was breathing heavily throughout, except for an hour or two of bad sleep. It was almost certainly a high fever, but I didn&#39;t measure. Chills, sweating. Complete misery. The extremely painful cycle lasted about 10 hours before it started to recede. I felt better close to 100% within 48 hours. I&#39;m reporting this because I&#39;ve realized that most people have &#34;mild flu like symptoms&#34; while my symptoms were extreme. If I had any other health issues (I don&#39;t) it seems obvious that it could have created a bigger problem. I didn&#39;t go to a hospital, but I should have, in hindsight.

                                                I got the vaccine and chills, fever, nausea, diarrhea and dizziness. I was kind of our of breath and fatigue, I wasn&#39;t able to life anything and constantly out of breathe. It was hard for me to do anything, I had to rest all the time and take off of work. I was driving to work and had to keep pulling over because I felt dizzy. I ended up going to the Dr. and had test ran and they said I was extremely dehydrated and I didn&#39;t understand because I drink a lot of water. they hooked me up an IV and gave me fluids. They said I was Healthy just extremely dehydrated it.  My injection site was kind of tender but nothing more. I&#39;m still having issues. I&#39;m just always thirsty no matter how much water I drink.

No additional adverse effects.  *It should be noted that the pharmacy where the vaccine was administered did not require any observation period, nor did they provide any info on VAERS, which is why I am reporting this three weeks after the shot.

Some leg pain was noticed the 2nd or 3rd day. And I have experienced ear ringing randomly about a week and a half after vaccination. Those may or may not be related.  Also I feel it important to note in March of 2020 (before testing was available) I experienced a very similar set of symptoms: fever, chills, fatigue, multi-day headache, body ache, 6 weeks of slight cough, leg pain, and a day a few weeks after the coughing started where I had shortness of breath. I wasn&#39;t tested back then as it was not available. But based on the symptoms I experienced, I truly believe I had COVID-19 last year prior to vaccination.
