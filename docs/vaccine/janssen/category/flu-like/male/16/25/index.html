                                                Patient received vaccine in the AM of 3/16/21.  Patient was in his usual state of health when he went to bed the evening of 3/16/21.  He ate dinner normally and his PD was started as usual.  There were no overnight complications with his PD and he got up shortly before 8 AM.  Mom reports the dialysate from his bag was clear and normal and none of his dwell was retained.  She heard a loud thud from the bathroom around 8 AM and the patient was found by his mother having generalized convulsions (bilateral upper and lower extremities) and he appeared to be foaming at the mouth.  He did not respond to her and she called 911. The seizure stopped by the time EMS arrived and his initial GCS was 12, and 15 by the time they started transport.  He had another seizure en route around 9:30 AM and was given 2.5 mg versed and required bagging. Patient was loaded with Keppra and now has been on maintenance Keppra. Patient has not suffered any additional seizures and is currently undergoing an extensive workup by inpatient neurology team. Vaccine adverse effect currently remains on the differential for inciting event leading to seizure however additional labs are pending to rule out other causes (eg. viruses causing PML).  Patient was also diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and started on antibiotics at time of admission.

He convulsed for around ten seconds after about two minutes of being unconscious. Four to five healthcare workers attended to him, asking him to &#34;stay with us.&#34; They called an ambulance, and the medics monitored him for awhile. Heart rate dropped to 34 bpm, clothing drenched with perspiration. Blood sugar was slightly low, although he had eaten a late brunch of two fried eggs, sourdough toast and fruit salad. The last thing he remembers is a cold sensation shooting down his arm and into his left hand. He tried to talk to say he wasn&#39;t feeling well, but he couldn&#39;t form the words, so he raised his arm and then fainted. He felt generally unwell the rest of the day, and today he is still not fully recovered.

                                                We gave patient the vaccine and advised him to wait for the CDC recommended 15 minutes observation time. He decided to leave after just a few minutes, despite his dad (who was with him) questioning the decision and suggesting he stay 15 minutes. I was then told by a member of management through our walkie-talkie system that they needed me at the front register immediately because someone passed out after getting a vaccine. I was there within the minute with my vaccine emergency bag. Upon arriving, the patient was already awake, talking, and sitting in a chair. He also was profusely sweating. He stated he&#39;s never experienced anything like this before. He said he normally has low blood pressure. He starting drinking some water. When I checked his blood pressure it was so low the machine gave an error message. Throughout this time, the patient progressively was feeling better and eventually wound up laughing and smiling. Him and his father said that he would be ok and that he was feeling himself. I told him to sit for a bit more before leaving and stay as long as he wants. I called him later that evening to check on him and had to leave a voicemail. His father called back 2 days later and said he&#39;s been fine.

                                                After a few hours, developed a low grade headache and some soreness at the injection site.  About two hours later I started getting extremely cold, despite the temperature in the mid-high 70s. I covered up under blankets. I began feeling very tired and a general sick feeling. After about an hour and a half of progressively worse chills and cold sweat, I began to get very very hot and removed all blankets and eventually clothes. I took my temperature, which was at 102 f. At this point I drank some water and Gatorade and waited for it to pass. I also noticed that my Apple Watch heart rate detection was saying my heart rate was in the high 90s to low 100s despite me just laying in bed. This was alarming because my typical resting heart rate is in the low 60s. About two hours later I felt well enough to at least brush my teeth, but upon standing up was greeted with an extreme feeling of weakness and dizziness and it was hard to keep myself up right. I eventually was able to fall asleep, and upon waking up, felt better, but still not great. My heart rate was more normal at this point, I no longer had chills or a fever, but still had a headache and soreness across my body, worst at the injection site.

He was cold and clammy. He never lost consciousness.  It took him a couple  minutes to &#34;come back&#34; to alertness and feel better.   Severe headache, chills starting and began asthma symptoms (wheezing) at 11;30pm the night of the injection.. 2 extra strength Tylenol did not help. He was very cold and the headache did not let up after several hours.  Eventually he had a bout of sweats and he reports he was soaked.  In the morning, at 8 am the headache was still severe...was sensitive to noise, light and touch. He was given 2 extra strength Tylenol at 8 and then 2 Advil at 10am, which finally began to reduce symptoms. He was not hungry, felt weak, and finally by late night he was feeling better.  In the morning on Saturday he awoke with a swollen left eye and blood shot in that eye.

                                                Mild fever &lt;100°, mild chills, severe exhaustion, severe body aches, fogginess. This lasted about 36 hours, with the exception of the left hand. The left hand experienced carpal tunnel and arthritis-like symptoms for 6 days longer than all other symptoms. It then went away on its own. To my knowledge, I hadn?t in any way performed stressful or repetitive behaviors leading up to the symptoms; I had been bedridden with the vaccine side-effects and was too exhausted to do much of anything.

                                                Adverse reaction started at approximately 1030pm about 8 hours after receiving the vaccine. I started to shake and took my temperature to find that I had 104.6 fever and took Tylenol 1000mg and tried to go to sleep. About 30 minutes later at 11pm I vomited so I went to talk to my parents. They took my temperature and it spiked to 106.7 knowing I had already taken Tylenol they grabbed ice packs and wrapped them in a towel and placed them under my armpits and behind my neck they also placed a damp cloth on my forehead and monitored my fever. At around 1145  my fever started to come down slowly to 104.2. Around 130am I ate a few crackers and took ibuprofen 600mg and the fever still slowly dropped at around 2am my fever was still at 102.4 at this time my  parents went to bed knowing that my body needed to continue to fight the fever. At 530am my father checked my temperature and it was normal.

The paramedics were called immediately. The seizure lasted about a minute.  The father was insistent that he get up and walk around. After 2-3 minutes he returned to his seat. Pharmacist attempted to take blood pressure reading. During blood pressure check the patient complained of fatigue and nausea and then began having another seizure. This also lasted about 1 minute.  About 2 minutes later the paramedics arrived and took patient to ER.

He was also pale and sweating.  I was making sure he had a pulse, when 911 arrived they assess him and his blood pressure was a little high.  After maybe 15 minutes he was feeling better and he told us that he was afraid of needles. Honestly we do not know if he was very anxious or if he had a reaction to the injection since he mentioned his throat was closing.

                                                Patient immediately reported the shot hurt more than usual shot and that he was feeling dizzy (he described it as &#34;the spins&#34;).  He stated getting warm to the touch and started sweating profusely. About 4-5 minutes after the shot he said he was nauseous. About a minute later he threw up.  He said that throwing up helped a little. RPh asked if he wanted some orange juice. He said he did and he took a few sips. He continued to feel warm to the touch and was sweating quite a bit. He also was quite pale.  RPh continued to monitor him, providing cool compresses to forehead and back of neck and continued to have him sip on orange juice (drank about 20 ounces aver 30 minutes).  He reported feeling better at 10:45am (about 30  minutes after shot.) RPh kept him for observation for another 15 minutes at which time he felt good enough to go home. Girlfriend drove him home. RPh called to check on patient at 6pm. Girlfriend reported he was doing ok and hadn&#39;t had any other reactions. He had just been sleeping all day.

                                                Patient reported running a fever last night after getting vaccinated yesterday afternoon. She did not have any rashes on her face till she threw up this afternoon and then she stated that she had rashes all over her face and it was itchy. I advised her to take some antihistamine and she had cetirizine 10mg at home and she took one tablet. And then I advised her to go to the ER.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Last night I was very warm, had a terrible headache, felt tired/dissociated and my entire body ached. I went to bed around midnight and woke up at 5 with terrible chills, body aches and a headache and couldn&#39;t stop shaking and couldn&#39;t fall back asleep for about an hour. I woke up around 10 drenched in sweat and had a bad headache, body aches and a 101 fever. I took ibuprofen last night, around 8 this morning at 5 and this morning at 10 and felt slight symptom relief but still have a fever.

I had him lie on the floor until he felt better. He was rubbing his head and thought he may have hit it on the floor. After 40 minutes he said that he felt ok and his head was not very sore. He declined to having us call for medical help.

                                                When trying to fall asleep night of vaccine, had chills and soreness and struggled to fall asleep. Throughout night woke up many times with same symptoms. At 6:00 AM woke up for good with a 102 fever, migraine, soreness, chills, and no energy. At 8:00 AM the fever got up to 103°F. I then took Tylenol and the fever slowly started to subside but the migraine, soreness, and lack of energy stayed. As of Tuesday, two days after the vaccine, symptoms have gone away.

He experienced vertigo as well as nausea. He tried to text and it came out as a jumble of misspelled words and letters. He called me, his mother, and he was extremely hard to understand and couldn&#39;t say a complete sentence without using words that made no sense. Him being in college I was 1.5 hours away. We were able to contact a friend of his and she was able to go to his dorm room and they called the campus on call nurse line. After speaking with her she instructed them to call 911 because she thought he could possibly be having a stroke. Patient was transported by ambulance to ER.

                                                Severe arm pain/low swelling in arm area. Nausea. Pain near liver area. General fatigue. Mental cloudiness. Random bouts of tinnitus in both ears, switching off, never both ears at once. The arm pain and swelling in shot area lasted about two days,  but the nausea, ;over pain, and fatigue continued for the better part of 4 days after the shot. The tinnitus only happened a couple times about 1-3 hours after the vaccination then ceased. I did not get this verified by a doctor, but I suspect my liver pain was related to an inflammation in the liver associated with the vaccine, as in the past, pain around my liver area has been associated with inflammation of my liver during minor flare ups.

He reported that he felt hot and sweaty and lightheaded. He appeared distressed. We called 911, then we provided a client with a cold pack. His pulse was 47 bpm and his spO2 was 97%. He continued to state that he was lightheaded so we had him lay down on the ground and take deep breaths. EMS arrived they collected his vitals which were WNL. His blood glucose was 71. He was warm and moist to the touch. EMS stayed with the client until 1350 at which point he had sat up and sat in the chair. He said he was definitely not having trouble breathing anymore and was feeling better. Provided client with a juice box and water. Client stayed onsite until 1410 at which point he said he felt comfortable leaving.  Client walked unassisted out of the clinic.

Heart rate (normally 60) spiked to 140 and could not see fit five seconds, had to call ambulance. Ambulance determined much of it was due to anxiety (multiple exams and significant work were due soon), and recommended medical supervision to ensure it did not escalate. Went to urgent care and was supervised until 1 pm, 24 hours after the vaccination, by which time symptoms had subsided

                                                Immediately after sitting down in the waiting area after receiving the shot, the pt reported feeling a strange pressure in their arm. Following this, the patient described the sensation of &#34;blanking out&#34;. The pt fell off their chair and lacked alert conconciousness for roughly five seconds. When the pt came to, they appeared confused and twitchy, with wide eyes and an overall appearance of shock. Pt remained in their state for roughly a minute, before stating that they felt completely better. The pt had developed a sweaty back but didn&#39;t state that they felt overally hot. They didn&#39;t mention being in any pain. The local injection site appeared a bit red but nothing of significant note. Pt did bump their head on the side wall behind the chair, receiving a minor bruise. Pt was given some water to drink and was monitored for 30 minutes. They pt stated they felt fine. They had no past history of fainting with vaccines, thought pt claimed to have passed out like this before but only after suffering a head injury. After their wait, the pt was allowed to leave and assured us that they felt completely fine.

We had been telling him he sounded congested and ill for several days prior, but he denied feeling ill.   Just thought he was groggy from waking up or having usual allergies.  Sunday morning he told us ?I think you were right.  I am sick.  Told us about pains.  Advised him to call advise nurse on insurance card.  He was told to rest and take otc pain reliever.   He rested but took no medication.  By the next day his arm pain was gone and chest pain reduced to only on deep inhale.

                                                High fever, extreme shaking and chills, nausea. I was pretty much immobile from 11pm-3am (until I was able to fall asleep) on the day of vaccination (3/8/21). This happened immediately after I showered with hot water. The next day  (3/9/21) until around 8pm I had a high fever, chills (not as bad but still pretty bad), headache, nausea, fatigue, and extreme muscle/joint pain particularly in my back and arms. I was unable to work, go to school, or do homework the entire day. After 8pm, I was down to a 100.4 fever and slight chills with mild nausea and fatigue. Today (3/10/21), I have mild muscle pain in my back and near the injection site. I took 400mg of ibuprofen every 6-8 hours from 3:00pm 3/8/21 (day of injection) to present with mild effects on pain and fever levels. I?m an infrequent user of ibuprofen. If I didn?t have someone with me the first night after the vaccination (3/8/21) I would have gone to the hospital.

                                                Immediately had a dull headache. About an hour and a half just didn&#39;t feel well and became very tired where he was dozing off.  About 7:00 pm started to shake.  This continued to get worse with severe jerking along with the uncontrollable shaking.  Had a rapid resting heart rate over 142 and a fever at 102.4.  Was incoherent, mumbling his words and not making any sense. Went to ER at 8:48 pm they did blood work, urine test and started an IV.  They weren&#39;t sure what was going on and first accused of doing drugs then wanted to do a spinal tap. His father stopped that and again told them it was from the covid vaccine. They finally gave him a shot of Ketorolac 30mg and LORazepan 1 mg. They sent him home and told him to take tylenol for his fever. spontaneous shaking kept on until late 3/11, along with a fever.  Friday 3/12 he is feeling better, fever has broke but not quite 100%.

Patient was fine immediately post administration in the IMZ room but witness stated he fell sideways (within a few minutes of receiving the vaccine) out of post-administration observation chair (which is in front of the pharmacy). Technician called code white and patient was immediately met with management and the pharmacy team. Patient was laying on his stomach on the floor, supporting himself upward with both hands/forearms. Patient had blood dripping from forehead and nose. Gauze was applied to laceration on forehead to help with bleeding and once patient was able to roll over on his back, an ice pack was applied to his forehead/nose area. Patient said he felt &#34;pain&#34; after the injection and then he felt light-headed. He remembered blacking out for a few seconds. Patient stated he felt &#34;ok&#34;, then later stated he felt better but just had a bad headache. Patient stated he felt &#34;it starting to hurt&#34; and that it triggered his anxiety. Dad was in the store and arrived a few minutes later; dad said son/patient has a &#34;fear of needles&#34; and &#34;he hasn&#39;t had anything to eat today in quite awhile&#34;. EMS arrived to examine patient and asked him if he needed to go to the ER; dad felt going to the ER was for the best since they had a 3 hour car ride home. Paramedics then transported patient to the ER and said he would likely need a stitch for the cut above his eyebrow.

I thought nothing of this until around 7:30 where I began to have extreme chills and a headache. Around 9:00, I tried to get some water and I was too dizzy to walk at any normal pace. I took my temperature and it read at 101.9F. I proceeded to take ibuprofen, drink lots of water (about 80 oz that night), and go to sleep as best as I could.

                                                Around approximately 9:30PM on April 10th, I started to experience chills that got progressively worse throughout the night. No amount of layers seemed to help.  Approximately 30min later I began to have a fever and a rapid heart beat started which led to chest pains . The chest pains subsided throughout the night, but the fever and chills lasted to around 11:00 AM, April 11th. I also had a bad headache from approximately  7AM to 10AM. Theses symptoms stopped around 11:00AM April 11th. Around 12 hours later I started experiencing chills and a fever again, however, these symptoms were less severe than the night before and subsided throughout the night.

This morning, Monday 4/12/2021 I woke up at 4am in a puddle of sweat, and started puking at 530am. I puked at least every hour multiple times. My whole body felt as if it was vibrating, or falling asleep (the worst feeling I&#39;ve ever had.)

                                                It is now the next day, and I feel significantly better. I have pain at the injection site, some muscle fatigue, a little bit of a depleted appetite, tiredness in my eyes and head (likely due to lack of quality sleep), and a bit of sweating, but my pain has reduced to maybe a 2/10 or 1/10 (i.e., not even uncomfortable). I did end up getting decent sleep between 2 AM and 12 PM with only a few interruptions of family members checking on me. The only notable pain that is worrying me is abnormal soreness in my right wrist that is not the result of overuse, overextension, etc., although I was able to take care of that pain with another 3 Advil pills. I am considering scheduling a doctor&#39;s appointment, as I know the J&amp;J vaccine got recalled today for blood clots. My assumption is that because I am a healthy 20-year-old, my immune system overreacted to the vaccine, but I want to check to make sure that it doesn&#39;t cause any additional health problems.

                                                The patient had a needle phobia and was very anxious prior to the vaccine. Once the patient received the vaccine, he waited in the waiting area for 15 minutes post-vaccine. About 5 minutes after the vaccine, he notified the pharmacy staff that he wasn&#39;t feeling well and he was feeling faint. The pharmacy staff provided him with a glass of water and was monitoring him. He said he  felt like he fainted and wasn&#39;t feeling well. He said he felt warm and sweaty. The pharmacy staff provided him with an ice pack. He then notified the pharmacy staff that he urinated in his chair while waiting post-vaccine. He wanted to be checked out and wanted us to call 911 . The patient began to feel better after about 20 minutes. The EMT arrived and checked the patient. Even though, the patient was feeling better, the EMT recommended the patient be checked further anyways. He was brought to the Triage center and was there for about 1 hour, according to the patient, and was feeling better. He said he felt slightly fatigued that day and the following day, but other than that he was feeling back to normal and no issues. He stated he has severe needle phobia and has experienced these fainting spells and anxiousness in the past. We followed up with the patient and he provided this information to us. He stated he was feeling good and back to normal. He had no further questions or concerns. We told him to follow up with us if questions or concerns came up.

Splotches were dark purple.  Went to clinic, they were unsure of the cause.  Waited a day and then went to another clinic where they thought it might be Coxsackievirus, except there were no sores in the mouth and the splotches were on the palms and pads of the feet.  The splotches faded over the next 2 weeks, the last place they were visible were on the upper arm,  torso and thighs.

She happened to be off today and was home with her son.  She stated that the seizure was like a Grand Mal seizure that lasted approximately 5 minutes. She stated that he has had a diabetic seizure before when his blood glucose levels were low.  She stated his blood glucose was 71.  She said this was different, he had no residual after effects. He was not incontinent of bowel or bladder and he woke up quickly afterwards.  About an hour after the seizure he ate and only complained of a headache.  She gave him ibuprofen 600 mg and he put an ice pack on his head.  She said he is better. She stated that she is a nurse and this really scared her, since it was so different than any other seizure he has ever had.  She was thankful she was home.  She call his primary healthcare provider and she did  not feel he needed to be seen.

He seemed confused and got up. As he appeared very unsteady and confused, I wrapped my arms around his torso so he would not fall. I asked him to lie down and he walked over to the chairs and sat down. I again asked that he lie down, but he stayed in the chair. He seemed lucid after a few minutes and asked for something cold water to drink. He was lucid at this point and took a small sip. He was sweating profusely and explained that he has  had this reaction before to  events and said it had happened when he witnessed a large gash on his brother&#39;s leg. I believe this was a situational reaction and not really related to the vaccination, as he had been vaccinated numerous times in the past. I had him wait 30 minutes and checked on him several times. He left on his own with a girl and another gentleman when the 30 minutes was over.

                                                About 9 hours after receiving the vaccine (around 2am) I had a fever, chills, headache, sore arm, and muscle soreness. I fell back asleep and when I woke up the fever had broken and the chills had improved but the soreness and headache remained. I took Tylenol in the afternoon and that helped the symptoms but by the time I had gone to bed the chills had returned but not a fever. When I woke up in the middle of the night (night 2) the chills had stopped and I woke up with a moderate headache and sweating profusely. After falling asleep and awaking in the morning I felt much better with the exception of a minor headache.

                                                The patient began experiencing nausea and light-headedness around 11:00 P.M. on the 6th of April. Three hours later, he reported lower back pain that steadily increased in severity over the course of several hours. Throughout that same night, severe headaches and impaired kidney capacity (i.e. constant need to urinate about every hour) kept him from sleeping longer than two or three hours. Come morning of the 7th (roughly 8:30 A.M.), he took a single capsule of ibuprofen and performed various lower back stretches in addition to walking around the house. During this time, he experienced a gradual decrease in symptoms and was able to eat a small meal. The patient returned to bed two hours after taking the medication and slept without any further interruptions.

At 3 am headache was migraine strength and was having full body aches (except for arms), extreme lower back and lower abdominal pain (he said it must be like what women experience in labor or during their menstrual cycle).   He got up and took temperature (normal) and blood ox (100 %SpO2 on two fingers).  He got a wet rag for eyes and tried to fall asleep.  He said he felt hot with cover on and cold with cover off.   At 5:50 am his father gave him two Motrin (400mg total), applesauce and a ice pack for his head and back.  I checked on him thru-out day and he seemed restless.  He woke up at 3 pm on 4/8/2021 said headache and major back pain/abdominal pains were gone. He still feels slightly achy, but fine otherwise. as of 8:24 pm.

He then had chills, fever of 101.2.  His pulse stayed at 95-100 beats per minute for 2 hours.  I spoke to a nurse friend of mine who told me to give him Tylenol and Benadryl.  His pulse went down to 80 beats per minute.  His fever went higher during the night but eventually broke.  Next morning he was still running a low grade fever and took Tylenol the rest of day.  He also had diarrhea on 2nd day and exhaustion.  3rd day feeling better but still tired.  No fever or diarrhea today.

                                                1. Vasovagal syncope almost immediately after vaccination, little to no warning of oncoming syncope 2. Extremely fast acting fever (temperature went from 98.6 to 100.5 in roughly 30 minutes) followed by nausea, pounding headache, and body aches/chills. Remedied by alternating very high doses of ibuprofen (800mg) and acetaminophen (1000mg or 1g) every two to three hours. This did not ever bring down the fever below 100 degrees. 3. Blurred vision around 29 hours after vaccine - advised to go to ER by triage nurse. ER doctor determined not to worry about, likely due to headache but not 100% sure.

Tuesday after the vaccine I got diarrhea with constipation along side the fatigue. Those symptoms lasted throughout Thursday. Friday night after the vaccine I got small haves around my head, neck, and upper back that would not away after an hour or two. That continued throughout Saturday and midday trough Sunday. Sunday I had shortness of breath after moving some water bottle cases around and lightheadedness along with the small hives at around 2pm I went to the ER to get checked out. Doctors said it was a reaction caused  by the vaccine. They gave me Benadryl for the reaction and injected me with a &#34;Steroid&#34; to the my upper buttock. I don&#39;t remember the name of what they injected with me. It is now Monday April 19th a day after the ER and I feel much better. The Benadryl made the  hives go away.

I had already instructed him to sit on the floor if he started feeling faint  as he stated previous fainting episodes as a kid. He sat on the floor, then laid on the floor. I brought him a garbage can in case he got sick, an ice pack, wet paper towels, and a bottle of water. After 5 minutes or so the color came back to his face and he started feeling much better. He then sat back in the chair, then stood up and stated he was feeling back to normal. I asked him to stay standing an extra minute just to make sure he was good, then he left with the woman who was with him during the vaccine.

                                                Patient received Janssen COVID19 vaccine (LOT#201A21A) in his left arm at approximately 14:43 on 5/25/21. During the 15 minute observation period, he expressed &#34;I don&#39;t feel well&#34; and endorsed dizziness/ lightheadedness, slight tingling feeling in fingers, and nausea. Shortly thereafter at approximately 14:50, he started to slouch and appeared faint while sitting in a chair with eyes closed. He did not fall or hit any part of his body. He was easily aroused with a touch on his arm and responded to verbal questions immediately. He denied trouble breathing, chest pain, palpitations, headache, muscle weakness, vision changes, skin reactions, swelling. He was oriented x3 and not exhibiting verbal or swallowing problems. His vitals were normal- HR 80 bpm and BP 105/80 mmHg. He was offered a receptacle to vomit in if needed; however, he did not vomit. This initial reaction was consistent with potential vasovagal reaction/ near-syncope after vaccination.   Patient was encouraged and instructed to sit on the floor to prevent injury in case of fall but he refused. Staff offered him water, a fan, and opened windows while monitoring.   Later while waiting for a ride at around 15:10, he endorsed headache (first above his eyes and then toward the back of his head) and clarified this did not feel like a typical migraine that he has had before. Then at around 15:20 he endorsed vision changes in his right eye- he could not see a portion of vision out of that eye except peripheral vision and described not being able to see writing on the right side of a whiteboard in front of him in the room. Later he described a resolution of that gap in vision but then had blurry vision out of that eye. He denied any vision changes in the left eye.   Due to alarming symptoms of vision changes and onset of headache, patient was recommended to go to ER for further observation and evaluation. He was not in urgent distress and patient did not wish for EMS to be called but agreed to go to ER when his emergency contact picked him up.    Patient&#39;s emergency contact came to pick up patient at approximately 15:40 and was recommended to take him to the ER. Patient and emergency contact were amenable to this plan. He was able to stand up and walk to the car without issues.

A few minutes later, he started feeling lightheaded and called his father. His father notified me that he was &#34;spazzing out/seizing&#34; with his head jerking backwards &#34;for a couple seconds&#34;. When I saw the patient, he was sitting and unresponsive to verbal and physical stimuli with his father patting his cheek. After a minute or so, the patient was able to respond, but his voice was faint. He reported having a &#34;severe headache&#34; and feeling &#34;sweaty&#34;. He had no fever or difficulty breathing. Father said there was no anaphylaxis, and asked for a bucket since the patient felt very nauseous. I then called 911 for emergency services. When I returned to the patient after the call, the father said he was feeling much better and that the &#34;color had returned&#34;. Patient was unwilling to stand, and remaining symptom(s) was headache. Emergency services came and checked blood pressure, which was normotensive (SBP 111). Father insisted ER visit was not necessary.

                                                Vaccine given at 3:35pm. Asked him how he was feeling at 3:40pm.

BP was 105/45 P 54. Patient admitted to a fear of needles and a history of anxiety. Also said he had not eaten today. BP measured again at 3:45pm --106/55 P 58. Gave patient a pack of peanut butter crackers and a water and rechecked BP at 4:00pm--104/57 P 65. Patient did not know the name of his regular doctor, so we called a clinic in town that he went to in May 2020 for a baseline BP reading.  NP clinic reported that his BP at last visit was 120/72. BP at 4:10pm had dropped back to 99/46 P 62. Declined EMS service, but I did make him call a family member to come get him since he had driven himself. Advised family to keep an eye on him and to take to ER if he declines. Patient stated that he felt better, but was hungry. Released to family at 4:20pm.

His brother reports that patient was sitting there and his eyes rolled back in his head and he fell off his chair and hit his head/right eye. Employee got out there and he was a bit combative and saying &#34;whats going on, whats going on&#34;. I asked him to sit down and employee called 911. We put pressure on his eye area to stop the bleeding. He was sweating, shakey, pale, and nauseous. Paramedics arrived quickly and eventually took him away on a strecher. Update: mom came back a couple of hours later to thank us and let us know that he is home and resting. He did get 3 stiches by his eye and the reason they took him via strecher was because his blood pressure was staying so low while they were here.

I went to bed early that day around 10PM. Woke up around 1:30AM on the 4th. Felt terrible and took my temperature. It read 101.5. Got up to use restroom and when washing hands, everything started to go blurry, I thought i had just become lightheaded and that it would pass so i stood there leaning against the bathroom door.I  ended up fainting and hitting my head on the cabinets. I was completely soaked in sweat.  An hour later we drove to the ER to make sure everything as okay. IV was started, some test performed, and fever was gone by 5AM. Felt completely fine after going home and resting for a few hours.

                                                The patient (self) felt a soreness around the site of the injection begin immediately and grow throughout the day. The soreness continued to at least April 12 (at the time of this report). The soreness was immediate unlike a tetanus shot but the pain the following days was 2-3 times less that of a tetanus shot. By 4pm the same day, the patient felt fatigue and tired and had difficulty staying awake. Around 6pm the patient took 200 mg of ibuprofen by mouth because of a strong headache. At 7pm the patient was experiencing the following: headache, warm head to the touch, shivering/shaking,  fatigue, mild aching. The patients pulse was consistent 100-104 bpm. The patients temperature at 8:30pm was 100.4 F. The patient then went to bed at 9pm. Patient had trouble falling asleep due to fever, shaking, aching. The patient slept intermittently until midnight. At midnight, the patient noticed the fever and shaking had ceased but the headache and aching were still strong. The aching was all over the body. The patients eyes hurt to move. The aching was constant and at times was throbbing. At 3am the patient could still not sleep well so he took 650 mg of Acetaminophen by mouth. The patient began to notice some relief approximately 30-60 min after. The patient fell asleep after the relief began and slept soundly til 9:15 am, April 11th. The patient awoke feeling much better. All side effects had stopped with the exception of a feeling of weakness and slight dizziness. The patient was able to carry on normally and took no more medications.

                                                I took a nap after around an hour of receiving my shot at around 1:40pm. Once I awoke at around 6pm, I had irritated eyes, extreme nausea, extreme dizziness, insatiably low body temperature, extreme shivers, migraine because of my head uncontrollably shaking, and dry mouth. I felt like I was in 20 degree weather and nothing I could do would heat my body up. My body grew so tired from the uncontrollable shaking that I could not get out of bed to get my phone to call 911. Every symptom I was experiencing was not mild and was to the level of extreme. This lasted until around 9am. I have been slowly recovering since then (currently almost 9pm) and feel only 70% back to normal.

                                                I first started developing chills and a mild fever about eleven or twelve hours after taking the vaccine. My entire body felt like burning and a headache came up not long after the fever.  I could barely fall asleep at night due to body ache and excessive sweating. The headache and body pain persisted till the next morning, and as of I am writing this response now, I feel extremely weak and I have no appetite at all.

                                                Around 6:15 PM the day of the vaccine, began to experience chills and a headache. I also became very dehydrated quickly and started to rest. I woke up around 8:30PM the same day with a fever of 102.7F, but no longer had chills. The headache had gotten worse and I took Ibuprofen to help the fever and headache. I feel back asleep until 11:30PM the same day when I was feeling better and had come down from my fever. I slept the rest of the night and woke up feeling dehydrated still and tired. When looking at my Apple Watch, my heart rate jumped to 90-120 BPM when the symptoms started and stayed around there until when I woke up the next day. The symptoms ran their course and I did not have any other events until April 13th, 3 days after the vaccine when I developed a dry cough.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  The vaccine was given at 10:45 AM. At 4:00 PM I began feeling nauseous. At 9:00 or 10:00 PM I began feeling both muscle and joint pain on my upper body which made it somewhat difficult to sleep. After one or two hours of sleep at 1:00 AM I woke up with a fever, headache, and worse muscle and joint pain (upper body only). When I woke up I was sweating profusely that the bed was lightly wet and extremely hot from all the heat my body was letting go. An ice pack can relieve the headache and fever. However, I was still not able to sleep. At 4:00 AM I made the decision to consume 800 mg of ibuprofen and it took 20 minutes for my headache and fever to go away. Yet, after being able to sleep for 30 minutes, I woke up again to the same headache and fever. Around 10:00 AM the symptoms were partly gone and was finally able to get sleep after a long night.

It&#39;s been going on for close to over a month and I&#39;m currently taking Acid Reflux medication, Vomiting and Nausea medication after going to the a gastroenterologist to which they didn&#39;t find anything doing an endoscopy that occurred on April 12th, 2021. Still waiting on the biopsy. With medication, current only symptom is painful stool (due to medication most likely) and after eating, burning in the throat (most likely due to acid reflux type symptoms). Only able to eat a certain amount before throwing up again.

                                                Patient was visibly nervous prior to receiving the vaccine. About 5 minutes after administration (during the 15 minute watch period), patient appeared to be slumped over in the chair. He had eyes closed and seemed to be shaking slightly. Pharmacist and tech grabbed the emergency kit and laid patient on the floor. After a few more seconds the patient woke up and was able to respond to questions. He was very pale, sweaty, reported feeling clammy and dizzy. Patient claimed he had not eaten since the morning. We gave him some water and a pb&amp;j sandwich. Patient stated he felt better and he just gets very nervous around needles. The patient sat with us for another 30 minutes until his grandmother and cousin were able to come pick him up from the pharmacy.

                                                Pt received Johnson and Johnson vaccine at about 145 pm. About 10 - 15 minutes later the pt was feeling light headed, nauseous, sweaty, and felt like he was going to faint. I attended to the patient, laid him on the ground bein case he fainted (which he did not), put his feet up, and asked him how he was feeling. The pt stated he felt better after laying down for a couple minutes and sat back up in his chair. I gave the pt the pt water and Gatorade and told the pt he would need to hang out for about 15 minutes longer. Pt stated he felt fine and 100% and requested to leave.

He blacked out for that short amount of time he said everything suddenly went black. He was able to get to the floor with assistance once he came to and he laid down, he was sweating and pale. his BP was 138-78 pulse 88 about 10 minutes after the event.  he had reported being nervous when he first arrived for his appointment. he also has severe food allergies but never had a reaction to a vaccine.

Patient asked for a glass of water. When getting the patient water my technician said she saw the patients eyes roll to the back of his head and that he was going to pass out. I went out to the patient and helped him to the ground and had him lay flat on his back with his feet elevated. After 3-4 minutes the patient was feeling better. Patient never lost consciousness.

                                                Pt passed out in chair about a minute or so after administration of vaccine. He brought along his girlfriend who was in the consultation room with him. Prior to administration, pt informed me that he was afraid of needles.  After administration, we discussed the type of needle that was used (vanish point syringe) and the mechanism of how it works. He seemd anxious so I advised that it was ok for them to sit in the room for a few minutes instead of getting up to wait in the lobby, I left the door open for them.  I walked back into the pharmacy and his girlfriend alerted me that he had passed out. He regained conscious within a few seconds. I advised he sit with his head between his legs, as he mentioned feeling light headed, feeling hot and sweaty. he threw up a little into the trash. pt sat in room for at least 30 minutes until he felt better. was given a few cups of water while sitting. did not leave until he felt comfortable and no longer light headed. pt mentioned that his last vaccine was about 2 years ago and the same response occured then.

                                                Sequence of Events re Incident  * Patient made his appointment via on- line scheduler  * Patient came in, filled out his paperwork, made no mention of previous vaccine issue on paperwork  * I performed the usual screening of patient, and when I asked him about any previous reactions to immunizations he stated that he had an ?issue with a TdaP shot 4 years ago and passed out in doctor?s office for several minutes.?  He stated the MD told him that ?he had several other issues with the shot so the MD said it was a ?bad batch??.  * I made sure that the patient was comfortable about getting the Covid shot and he agreed that he was fine to get it. At that time the patient did not seem overly nervous about receiving the shot.  * I administered the shot to the patient and he went directly to the seats next to the pharmacy. I asked him to stay there because he had a past issue with another vaccine.  * Approximately 2-3 minutes later, the patient came back, looked troubled and said he didn?t feel well and was feeling the same way as the other shot. I brought him back into the pharmacy immunization room, sat him down and put his head between his knees. I did a quick check on him to be sure he was breathing OK and that there was no apparent allergic reaction.   * After a minute I brought his head back up and put patient into regular seated position. At no point did he completely lose consciousness or faint. I asked him at that point if he wanted me to call an ambulance or a family member and he declined. He sat there in the chair for approximately 15 minutes- part of the time his head was in his hands, part of the time looking at his phone. He asked for a glass of water and I got him one (he had completely drank it by the time he left). I kept checking on him and it seemed like every time he saw me check on him he put down his phone and put his head in his hands again. He could have been embarrassed by the situation, unsure though. I tried to make him as comfortable as possible.  * After 15-20 minutes I asked him if he wanted me to call someone and he said at that point he wasn?t sure he wanted to drive home so he would call his mother to pick him up, which he did.  * I sat down with him for a couple of minutes and explained that this was called a vasovagal response and was quite common (I even empathized with him by explaining that I have the same response when I get blood drawn at the doctor?s office). He seemed to feel a little better after I explained it to him.  * His mother came in 15 minutes later and I brought her back as well. She explained the same thing happened at the MD office 4 years ago and that it was the Meningitis shot, not Tdap. I explained to them going forward that it would probably be best to get his immunizations at the doctor?s office so that he could lay down after the shot and they agreed.  * He and his mother then walked out of the immunization room and left the building. He left under his own power and without assistance from his mother. I gave him a business card and asked him to call me on Sunday to let me know that he was feeling ok.

I took Tums, Pepto, and other prescriptions to try and alleviate those pains. None of those worked so around 5:30- 6pm (4/25/2021), I went to ER. When I went in they took blood work, a urine sample, and then gave me Iv fluids, and other medications. The Dr. confirmed that I was dehydrated, and I had a normal reaction to the shot. I was in the ER for about 2-3 hours, and then they let me to go home. I went to work the next day.

Shortly after coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, and dizziness began and lasted until about 8AM. It was severe enough that I almost went to the ER. But my rescue inhaler was helping to control the coughing some. This was by far the worst ~8 hours of my life. I have never felt anything like it, and I had Covid earlier this spring and it was not nearly as bad.

                                                Starting about 12 hours after my vaccine, I started to feel fatigue and body aches.  An hour after that I experienced intense chills and a sense of dread. I put a heater on myself with two layers of thick blankets, but it didn&#39;t help. My fingers and parts of my face started to tingle and go numb and I couldn&#39;t fall asleep in spite of me doing breathing exercises and lying down. Eventually the chills turned into a fever and my body temperature suddenly shot up. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer, but it was certainly over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Despite my relief from the chills, I still couldn&#39;t sleep.  I wasn&#39;t remarkably stressed/anxious, I just couldn&#39;t get to sleep. I&#39;m not typically an insomniac, and upon speaking to others who received the same vaccine, they&#39;ve also reported intense chills and an inability to fall asleep.

The following day (Monday) I felt completely fine and had no adverse symptoms or side effects. Tuesday was fine as well until about 2pm after I ate lunch, during a meeting my arm went numb as well as my legs and I had trouble concentrating and could not hold a conversation. Went home and slept until Wednesday morning. Today, Wednesday, I am still not feeling normal and am having trouble concentrating at work, low light seems to help. No numbness today but still feel dazed and not able to focus

He had his eyes open but was unconscious for about 1 minute. Then he released his bladder and peed on himself. The pharmacist noticed and came over then he responded and was consious again. Then he began to sweat excessively all over his body. His face turned pale and the pharmacist began taking his blood pressure which dropped very low. He then began to feel nauseated. Then he started to get body chills. We monitored my husband there for another 30min and he slowly was coming back to his normal self. He had a small headache but was fine enough to leave.

                                                Fatigue around 10 hours after initial vaccination. Radiating ache and joint pain from the injection site. After 12 hours, temperature reached 99.7 F.  At 14 hours after vaccination, major aches and soreness, chills and fever rose to 101.2. By 1:00am fever had reached 103.0F (all temperatures taken with ear thermometer). I took 1000mg of Tylenol at that time, which greatly reduced the aches and pains. Woke up with a temp of 99.2, minor aches, almost all effects had subsided.

The symptoms from the vaccine were significantly worse; however, they appear to have lasted for a much shorter period.

I woke up at 4:30am the morning after receiving the vaccine needing to use the restroom, but I could barely get out of bed because of my severe body aches and lack of energy. When I did manage to get out of bed, I struggled to even stand up. I took 800mg of ibuprofen at that time (around 4:30am) for the pain, which helped. I spent more than the first half of my day in bed under layers of blankets until about 3:00pm, where I finally felt good enough to get out of bed. I didn?t feel the body aches completely go away until the morning of the 8th, 3 days after receiving the vaccine.

                                                Apart from the expected side effects (headache and chills, some soreness at injection site), I believe I&#39;m experiencing tinnitus or a similar ringing in my ears. It appears to be concentrated in my left ear, although it&#39;s hard to tell. There&#39;s a consistent high-pitched tone that won&#39;t go away. I&#39;m not entirely sure when it started (maybe 24-36 hours after receiving the vaccine), but it&#39;s gotten slightly worse since then and is more noticeable. I have not been able to go to the doctor yet.

                                                I got th eJassen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA at 10:50am. When the needle was removed, blood ran down my arm. That has never happened, but it might have been the nurse. I had nausea for a few minutes afterwards, but I think that was due to the blood. I didn&#39;t feel like eating after the shot. Hours later, around 5pm or so, I started to feel hypersensitive and weak. I also started to have a fever that went up to 102.2 farenheit before decided to take ibuprofen.  I had shakes, a heartbeat of 146, and a headache. It lasted all through the night and into the next day. Around 11:20am, whenever I moved my head, I would feel pain in my head. By the end of this day, I started to feel more like myself. By the start of the third day, all I had was pain in my left arm from the shot. It was strange that the pain got worse from Day 1 to Day 3, but that might be from how the vaccine was given and the blood that ran down my arm at that time. Another thing is my appetite has gone down a lot. I don&#39;t want to eat and when I do, I just want to stop. It&#39;s been a couple days, so I&#39;m hoping my appetite will come back.

Fever and body aches subsided in the morning, but still don&#39;t feel right and couldn&#39;t exercise.   Brain fog came on about 4:00 after 11:00 am shot. Very difficult to concentrate and do work, found myself walking into rooms and forgetting why. Brain fog is still there today while body aches have subsided, very challenging to focus or work on computer and just feel slow and dumb.

                                                About 4 minutes after administering the vaccine patient was sitting down in the waiting area and stated that he was not feeling too good. I immediately went over to him, at which point I noticed he was sweating profusely and stated he felt a little light headed. Less than 1 minute afterwards, he stopped talking and his eyes began to roll back, at which point his upper body began to slide over to once side as if he was going to fall. I immediately caught him, motioned for someone to call emergency services  and continued to call him name. He did not respond, was pale and blacked out for about 30 secs. He was still breathing thankfully. When he regain consciousness, he stated that he felt better but he felt some tingling sensation in his forearms bilaterally. Thankfully at this point emergency services were present and upon taking his vitals, realized that his HR and BP were significantly low for someone of his age.

Submitting  to VAERS following ED visit and admission.  23 y.o. male with no previous past medical history presented 6/10 with complaints of dizziness, presyncope and syncopal episodes.  Initial fainting episode was in January 2021 upon receiving sutures the laceration on his his right index finger.  At the time he reports that although he passed out he did not really lose consciousness as he was aware of his surroundings.  Things seem to go fine for a while until the day after he received his J &amp;J vaccine in April 28, 2021.  Reports having the usual post vaccine symptoms such as myalgias and malaise but the following day  while at the barbershop he reports having another syncopal episode.  He reports a prodromal phase that includes shortness of breath, numbness of the lips and a generalized warm feeling.  During this episode he denied any loss of consciousness, as he was able to unlock his phone and respond to the people around him.  He denies any myoclonic movements or jerks.  He denies any postictal symptoms.  Patient has been seen in the ED 3 times within the last week.  On 6/10/2021 while at the base clinic, he reports feeling like he was about to pass out and was brought to the emergency department for further evaluation.  He denies any nausea, vomiting, headaches.  He endorses some chest pain when he lays down flat that is relieved by leaning forward.  He denies any recent illness.  Denies any new medications or changes to his diet or hydration status.    The day prior to admission, his ED visit for weakness and presyncope occurred shortly after PT eval at the base.  He felt very lightheaded and he attributes that to not eating and drinking prior to the PT eval.     Work-up in the ED included EKG which showed ST elevation in leads V3 and V4 in a biphasic pattern.  CT chest which showed no PE or consolidation pneumonia or pleural effusion.  CMP was remarkable for potassium of 3.4 serum bicarbonate of 21.  CBC was normal.  CK was slightly elevated at 913.  Troponin was negative.  Lactic acid was 1.9.  UA with no concern for infectious process.  UDS was negative.  Due to EKG findings reported above, patient was discussed with cardiologist who recommended that patient be admitted for observation.   Upon further discussion with patient, it was clear that his chest discomfort improved when leaning forward, and his EKG was consistent with diffuse ST elevation.  With a clinical diagnosis of acute idiopathic pericarditis, patient was initiated on colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily and ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily.  He is to continue his colchicine therapy for 3 months and his ibuprofen therapy for 1 to 2 weeks with a gradual de-escalation of that ibuprofen by 200 mg/week.  He has follow-up with cardiology scheduled.  Cardiology mentioned in their notes that they would obtain an echocardiogram to rule out structural heart disease and recommended a 2-week event monitor upon discharge with a 3-week follow-up with tilt table testing and exercise stress testing.  Cardiology had high suspicion for possible vasovagal.  Echocardiogram was unremarkable without pericardial effusion.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At 11 PM the night of the vaccine (Saturday), extremely bad chills, fever and weakness set in almost immediately. I could not get my body to warm up and was borderline too weak to walk. Very bad headache and nausea set in as well.  After several hours the chills turned to intermittent sweating/cold and I could not keep a consistent body temp, nor sleep that night. The next morning  (Sunday) I had very bad aches and soreness, along with chills/fever and headaches that could be managed fine with around the clock acetaminophen. Around 8 PM that night, most of these flu like symptoms subsided. The following morning (Monday), still very exhausted despite a full 10 hours sleep. Tiredness and weakness lasted through the day. Tuesday morning until around 3 PM i still experienced drowsiness and was unable to gain strength for anything more than typical day to day tasks (could not workout). Wednesday morning, felt normal but while exercising experienced shortness of breath almost immediately as well as chest/lung pain easily. Come Thursday I feel 90% normal.

I had a fever of 101 all day long, a headache, my body was aching from head to toe, extreme lethargy, and occasional bouts of extreme nausea as well as throwing up twice. As of the following day (March 18), almost two days since receiving the shot, I feel pretty much completely normal again aside from a slight headache and some pain at the injection site still. I experienced some pretty bad side effects that only really lasted a day.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Roughly 1 hour after vaccination I started to experience nausea and fatigue. The fatigue continued for several hours until about 6-8 hours after vaccination. At that point I started to experience chills, muscle aches, and rash on my left arm (at injection site region) and over other parts of my body. Temperature at that time was still within normal range but close to 10 hours after I began to run a fever. Highest temperature at its peak was 100.3F. These symptoms continued into the night but began to considerably subside in the morning, close to 24 hours after vaccination. At this point, 26 hours after, I still feel mild muscle aches and a mild headache.

                                                At roughly 6 days after vaccination my body developed Hives head to toe. Roughly 18 or so hours after initial hive development I sought treatment for a anaphylactic reaction in my throat and face area. I received a steroid and a Pepcid to calm it down, and was given an epi pen and sent on my way. The following now two plus weeks since then I&#39;ve had episodes of dizziness, shortness of breath and headaches that seem to be constant. There has been almost no relief from these symptoms, however the rash has completely resided. I&#39;ve taken an Aspirin in the mornings to deal with the headaches but strenuous activity seems to bring these on much more prominently.

                                                Worst headache I?ve ever had (8 out of 10 pain scale), could not sleep due to the headache, very lightheaded, entire body ached (could barely move), eyes hurt, highest fever temp 102.8, nausea (at times I thought that I may have to puke). These symptoms lasted all night, but felt better in the morning. These symptoms were like COVID but x5. When I had the COVID-19 virus, my symptoms were not as bad as yesterday?s adverse effects from the vaccine. At 3 AM, I was considering going to the hospital and I have never been hospitalized before. I could barely open my eyes since the headache was so bad.

He approached the counter a few minutes later to report he wasn&#39;t feeling well.  As he was speaking with the technician he became very pale, reported lightheadedness and fainted with loss of consciousness.  The technician reported that he witnessed convulsive type tonic movements concentrated in the neck and upper-arms more than the abdomen or legs.  He also reported foaming at the mouth and following each event which repeated 3 times in less then 15 minutes,  he woke with confusion and no memory of where he was.  EMS arrived after 15 minutes and transported the patient to the ED for evaluation.    Upon follow up with the patient the next day, he reported that the ED found nothing on his medical exam and he had worked a 10 hour shift prior to receiving the vaccine and had had nothing to eat or drink.

                                                At roughly 4pm the day of vaccine I started to feel generally sore in my muscles. At around 7pm I started to become light headed, had a headache, and bad muscle pain. My fever at this point measured 102f. These negative effects increased over the next few hours until I fell on the floor and couldn&#39;t get up without help from my wife. I felt like I was going to pass out every five seconds, threw up twice, my muscles kept contracting and relaxing and were intensely painful. Around 12:30am Saturday morning we went to the emergency department. I needed a wheelchair to get around. The wait at emergency was too long, and by 3am we went back home. I was feeling slightly better, but still not great, and my fever had reduced. I rested on Saturday with less severe but still considerable symptoms, and took paracetamol. Now on Sunday I feel sick and a little sore and very tired, but mostly better.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Starting on 4/11/21 at around 12:00 pm I started to have a numbness on both sides of my face. It felt as though there were pins and needles throughout my face. I would say that it was a 4/10 in terms of intensity. At first I thought maybe it was due to drinking coffee without food or other water (I don&#39;t regularly drink coffee but I have never had these symptoms from coffee before). However, even after eating food and drinking a sugary drink around 4:00 pm, the pins and needles remained. The symptoms began to subside at 6 pm or 7 pm.  The only other normal symptoms that I had were feeling tired on 4/8/21 and 4/9/21. Also, on 4/9/21 I had very slight muscle soreness throughout my body. I have also had difficulty concentrating which may or may not be related.

                                                Patient had an initial response 2 days after the vaccine, with general malaise,  dry mouth, headache and itching hands as well as local discomfort at the injection site that seemed to resolve spontaneously. On April 3rd he had non-specific changes in his hands that he attributed to cold weather that led to discomfort when running them under warm water. By monday APril 5th he was having worsening sensitivity in his hands and feet to heat, touch and experienced numbness. he also began to have difficulty walking. He went to the ER April 6th and was discharged April 7th after undergoing MRI of the brain and spinal cord, labs and lumbar puncture, with a presumptive diagnosis of early Guillain-barre Syndrome. His symptoms continued to worse, loss of gait was more pronounced as well as loss of balance and new off sensations in his tongue. He was admitted to the hospital, continued to undergo diagnostic workout. Results from tests on APril 6th came back positive for Anti nuclear antibodies and high protein in his CSF. He was treated with 3 days of infused Immunoglobolin therapy and was discharged on April 11th with a diagnosis of likely GBS. His symptoms continue to worsen slightly, but with less day to day decline

                                                (Saturday)When I came home after I received the vaccine I didn&#39;t really have anything to do, so I decided to take a nap and rest. I think after I woke up is when I started to feel the side effects. I can&#39;t remember exactly but I started feeling cold. I didn&#39;t think too much of it I just thought it was a cold day (which was quickly turning to night). Later that night I started feelinga bit dizzy and my head was hot but I still had chills. Since I had a had a blanket with me, and I think I was starting to feel what would become muscle aches, I just didn&#39;t want to move from the couch to my room. Feeling chills the rest of the night, I realized it was bad choice, since one of my family members left a window open. The cold air of the night really exacerbated my chills. Despite the cold I was still able to sleep, but the next day (Sunday) I did have a slight cough which I think was from experiencing the cold air of the night and not a side effect from the vaccine. (Sunday) This is when I really felt all the side effects. I felt weak, chills, headache, dizziness, muscle aches,(I&#39;m not sure if I had a fever, I couldn&#39;t think clearly my head felt hot). I haven&#39;t had a hangover but I think that is what it would feel like to have one. I basically slept most of day Sunday ; This time in my room with  3 blankets (light blankets )and heat up (felt like 80°F under blankets). I was sweating under the blankets but it really helped warm me up and alleviate my chills. I woke up later that day to a call to help my sister with some work. I couldn&#39;t drive, felt weak and dehydrated(dark orange/yellow pee), but she insisted so she picked me up and scolded me for not eating anything all day(besides the side effects I mention, I think I may have also lost my appetite because I felt dizzy). I was still feeling my head aching after I woke up, still had muscle aches and a slight cough too. It was raining that day so I put on a winter coat with layers underneath to help with my chills. At her home she gave me a Gatorade (and water) which I think really helped since I was sweating a lot under the blankets when I fell asleep. She also gave me some home cooked meals she made. The combination of drinks, food, and familial concern really helped me recover. By Monday my cough was gone and the side effects had worn off to the point that I could go to work safely.   My mother &amp; father also received vaccine at the same time I got it. My father also experienced side effects but his started later with the most effects felt on Tuesday. My mother did not get any side effects.

The headache went away before the appointment (did not take any medication); however the headache returned about 10 minutes after I got vaccinated. A few hours later the headache converted to a migraine resulting in increased nausea. Overnight I developed a fever. Within 24 hours, all the symptoms were gone. At this time I have fully recovered from all side effects but am monitoring my heath to see if anything else comes up.

                                                During the observation period, the patient became lightheaded and dizzy.  He complained of sweating and cold skin.  The pharmacist immediately went to the aide of the patient.  The patient was laid on the ground and we began to get a blood pressure reading.  We also gave the patient cold pack to place on the skin.  The patient never lost consciousness and was verbal and responding to pharmacist questions the entire time.  We asked multiple times if he needed EMS and he each time told us he did not.  His status continued to improve with deep breaths and cooling the skin.  After 10-15 minutes he felt like he could sit up in the chair and did just fine and continued to recover.  We kept watch over him.

Less than 5 minutes after recieving the vaccine he stated he was not feeling well, I noticed that he had perspiration on his forehead. I gave him a small cup of water, he immediately vomited both the water and contents of his stomach. I gave him a bottle of water. He continued to sit near the pharmacy for roughly 45 minutes after which he stated he was feeling much better and left for home.

Went to bed around 10:30 and woke up about 3 hours later at 1:30. Had chills and was shaking when I got up. Could not really fall back asleep. Chills turned into a fever. That morning I started to get a headache. I sounded congested at one point, but no runny nose. I also had body and joint aches.  I took Excedrin three times that day. Once in the morning, once in the afternoon, once before bed. I used zquil to sleep a little bit in the afternoon and again at night. I woke up Sunday and felt completely fine except for my arm still being sore.

                                                About 9 hours after getting my vaccine, I started noticing my temperature rising to ~99.0. About 1 hour later (12 AM), it had risen to ~103. I also noticed my heart rate was extremely high (on average 140 bpm, the highest was 225 bpm); this was also accompanied by chest pains which seemed like they were on the right side of my heart; I also had difficulty controlling my bladder and would randomly start to urinate. I had taken two Advil then slept.  The next day (~9 am) my fever went down but 3 hours later it had gone back up to ~101, I eventually kept cooling myself (removing shirt, fan on high, etc.) and took one Advil and my temperature started to get normal.  For about two days after that, I had pain in my left shoulder - but this was where the injection took place so I wasn&#39;t too worried. Currently I am feeling fine, but the initial day getting the vaccine was quite harrowing - I was quite worried I was going to have a heart attack.

Around 9:00 a.m. or so that same morning, I went to  Emergency room because I was so sick I didn&#39;t know what to do. They said I was just having a reaction to the vaccine, and it should go away in a day or so. They gave me Ibuprofen and Tylenol and a shot of toradol. I was then discharged and went back to my living quarters. I had covid already back on January 20th 2021. But the vaccine was five times worse than the virus.

                                                First felt pressure on right side of head on Tuesday May 4th.  Took Vaccine on Sunday May 9th. Experienced fever, chills, and dizziness until Tuesday May 11th. Noticed head pressure increase and spread to left side of head and top side of head on Thursday May 13th. Noticed head pressure spread to back of head on Friday May 14th. Pressure and tenderness on all sides of head, with pulsating superficial veins make it difficult to sleep, as pain increases in conjunction with amount of time resting head on pillow. ER doc persribed fioricet on Wednesday May 19th. Felt tingling and numbness down left side of body in reaction to it on Friday, May 21st. Visited ER on May 21st, and received migraine cocktail. Helped relieve pain so that I could lay my head down to rest, but did not stop pulsating throbbing of superficial head veins. May 24th, neurologist prescribes steroids for pain and inflammation, and sleep medication so I could sleep. Sleep noticeably improved. Still testing out 50mg dose of steroids. Steroids noticeably do nothing for pulsating throbbing superficial veins.  *Note: I worry this vaccine may have exacerbated the headache I was feeling prior to my vaccination, or that the vaccination was fine, and what I am experiencing now is merely a extension of the headache I was feeling prior to vaccination.

                                                He got his vaccine, he had the fever that evening. Overnight he started vomiting some brown gunk that looked like dried up blood from 1:00-2:00 AM. He did not have much of an appetite. This continued the following night around the same time.  Then he started vomiting again the third day after the vaccine, and he vomited after work and was pretty much vomiting nonstop and started having difficulty in swallowing. Feeling fatigued. On Thursday morning at 2:00 AM he went to the ER on 4/29/21 and they prescribed him some anti-vomiting medication. That worked for about a day. On Friday he started spitting into a cup and spit about 3-5 cups of spit. On Saturday he went to the hospital on 5/1/21 and looked in his throat and said that he had some acidic burns from the vomiting and prescribed him Ondansetron 4 mg for the vomiting, which he did not take much of. They also prescribed him Diphenhydramine elixir to soothe his throat which he took every 6 hours which worked like wonders he said. He started to feel better after that point. He tested negative for COVID in the negative. He did have COVID in November of 2020, and he had vomiting at that time as well.  He was sick with COVID for about a week. He did not have much of an appetite either. He also felt very fatigued and felt better following Thanksgiving and tested negative the Monday after Thanksgiving. The fatigue symptoms lasted about 3 weeks after he tested negative, so he was sick for about a month in total.

                                                Patient received the vaccine at approximately 10am on 6/21/21. Shortly after receiving the vaccine, he complained of a headache and arm pain. Patient was told to remain seated and was monitored by pharmacist and staff. After 20 minutes, he was still not feeling well. He was moved into a different observation area. Based on symptoms it appeared he was having a a vasovagal reaction. He did not want to lie down and elevate his feet. At approximately 1/2 hour, he became nauseous and threw up. We continued to monitor him. He still had a headache and said he felt off. He had no swelling in the face and was speaking without issue. No hives were noticed. Patient said he was having a hard time breathing- I suggested he remove his mask to get more fresh air. After removing the mask, he said it felt better to breathe. In total, patient was monitored for 3 hours. He did not lose conscience, exhibit facial swelling or hives.  Patient went back to work for 1 hour then left to go home.  Prior to receiving the shot, patient showed a lot of anxiety and was hesitant to get vaccine. In the end, he decided he wanted to get it. Per medical staff at his work, he does tend to be high stressed and anxious. I followed up with patient on 6/22/21. He stated that he was feeling a lot better. He did have redness at the injection site- I explained he could ice the area. He still had a headache= I instructed him he could take a pain reliever. He mentioned he had a purple spot on his back. I asked if he had any other spots and said he would have to check. I suggested he contact his PCP and make an appointment to be seen.

Feeling of throat closing and itchiness in the cheek and jaw area of the face indicating an allergic reaction. Symptoms are still prevalent as of today 6/24/21. I have a feeling that something is stuck in my throat/throat closing after eating most foods and consuming hard alcohol and beer. Coffee doesn?t seem to be a factor, as I originally thought the reaction was acid reflux/digestion related. Sometimes the reactions are severe enough to make breathing difficult. I have no history with food allergies and no preexisting medical conditions. My father also had the same reaction following his Janssen vaccination. He reports that he no longer has this symptom.

                                                I received the Janssen vaccine on 3/19 at 8pm. 7 hours later ~3am I awoke to severe chills, climbing fever, and nausea. OTC fever reducers helped bring the fever down eventually. The entire day (3/20) my fever was on and off and nausea would also be present. Bouts  of feeling well and bouts of fever. Had a minor fever when going to sleep that day and the fever was gone when waking up on 3/21. So ~24 hours of side effects.

Took 3 Tylenol at around 3:00 AM when it became clear I was not well. Fell asleep around 5:00 AM after Tylenol kicked in and got super hot instead of super cold. Woke up around 11:00 AM with no fever, but slightly achy. Aches went away by nighttime, and felt 100% the next morning, April 3rd.

He was observed in the immunization area for approximately 5 minutes when he began to feel better and moved to observation area for 1/2 hour. Patient left stating he was feeling ok.

                                                Patient stated they didn&#39;t feel well at all and was sweating.  I told him I should give him an Epi Pen, but he preferred receiving generic Benadryl. At approximately 12:50pm he was given 50mg of diphenhydramine since he wasn&#39;t having any swelling to inhibit swallowing. He drank half the bottle of water. He stated his vision was spotty, but getting better. I told him we should give him the epi pen and call 911.  He asked us to call girlfriend to let her know he wasn&#39;t feeling well. After another few minutes he stated his vision was getting better and feeling much better. At 1:12 we took his blood pressure 102/67 pulse of 47.  He stated the pressure and pulse were normal for him since he is a runner.  (He had run a marathon the previous weekend). He was monitored for 30 minutes.  After the 30 minutes, he felt fairly normal and was going to be with someone the rest of the day working at home. He was given more benadryl and advised to seek emergency medical attention if symptoms returned and were worse. Around 7;30pm I called to check on him. He had taken another dose of benadryl 50mg.  He still felt comfortable not seeking er attention since he was going to be with friends the rest of the evening and night.

I laid him on the floor with his legs up and ice packs on his neck.  He never lost consciousness and recovered quickly.

Had insomnia all night.   6:00 am: woke up with bad headache, slight fever.   7:00 am: got out of bed and had vertigo and was running into walls trying to walk to my living room, along with the worst migraine I?ve ever had. Also had dizziness, nausea,  chills, 100&#43;degree fever, aches, skin sensitive to touch, and severe tinnitus. All of the veins were visibly popping out of my head.   As the day went on, everything got worse. Any time I moved, my head would throb so bad that I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital.   3:45 pm:  the headache started to finally go away. It would only hurt if I moved fast. At this point my fever was only slightly high, about 99 degrees. I was still unstable when I walked and dizzy. I went from being super cold, to being super hot and sweaty. And I was alternating between cold &amp; hot and sweaty for the rest of the night. Was also having some memory issues, repeating things when I was having a conversation with someone over the phone.   I was sweating all night when I was sleeping.   Saturday 4/10: 7:00am: woke up with a slight headache; still out of it and dizzy.   8:00am: after being awake for about an hour or so, I looked in the mirror and my whole face (around the lips, cheeks, and jawline, and under the eyes) was really swollen and puffy. My face was even mis-colored. Under my eyes was purple and yellow, and my cheeks were white.   Some confusion persisted throughout the day as well as dizziness.

                                                I experienced all of the listed side effects (except, I didn&#39;t have an actual fever, I felt like I had a fever, but my temperature was normal). The chills and muscle pain were extremely intense 6 hours after I received my vaccine. I could not stop shivering, or get warm enough. That would be followed by a feeling that I was too warm and I would begin sweating profusely. I also experienced a few additional side effects I could not find listed:   I felt especially sensitive to stimuli as if normal sensations were heightened (e.g. hot water in a shower felt painful, running fingers through my hair felt like I was having my hair pulled, I kept my eyes squinted because the sunlight through the windows felt too bright.)  I was extremely irritable and became extremely frustrated easily. I mean frustrated to an embarrassing degree over small things that didn&#39;t matter. It was inconsistent with my day-to-day temperament. It felt like an adrenaline rush came in response to the most minor of inconveniences.

Pt. came to profusely sweating, pale, and feeling dizzy.  We took his BP and kept monitoring it for 45 minutes after we had him lay down.  His BP continued to rise and was normal.  Pt. was nervous before vaccine administration (shaking).  After event, Pt. stated this has happened in the past with donating blood.  Pt.&#39;s girlfriend picked him up, so he did not drive home.

I immediately grabbed another chair and raised his feet above his heart level. He immediately stated that he was &#34;feeling better&#34; and his vision was improving. I then offered him a cold bottle of water. He appeared very stable within a few minutes. We did call 911 as a precaution, they arrived a while later and deemed the patient was stable and their additional services were declined by the patient. I insisted the patient stay and finish the bottle of water. All together I believe the event was about 30 - 35 minutes before leaving. I encouraged the patient to drink plenty of fluids and electrolytes and to take it easy for the rest of the day.

I received the shot Friday morning, by Friday evening the symptoms had appeared and worsened throughout the night and day on Saturday. By late evening(6-8) I began feeling much better. The symptoms included body aches, high fever, chills, nausea, hallucinations, dehydration, dizziness, loss of appetite,  exhaustion, and a restless night of sleep.

                                                After a few hours I know it is more common symptoms such as pain at the injection site, headache, fever, all over body soreness.   I also noticed short-term memory loss and mood changes from feeling of Happy and sad and angry from around 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.  and the feeling of complete uselessness and regretting getting the vaccine to the point I wanted to cry saying oh I made a mistake. Almost as if my body was trying to tell me this was a mistake.  Throughout the evening the all over muscle soreness and headache and fever seem to be getting worse I even woke up in the middle of night between 2:00 and 3:00 a.m. and took Tylenol PM to help go back to bed.   Started feeling better later in the afternoon on April 2nd. Almost if everything went away and back to normal.   I have noticed that I have been having more head pain (I normally have none) than normal since receiving the vaccine.

                                                In the span of about 40 minutes following the shot, I had severe reactions. I initially felt really warm in my arm and my heart started to race for a bit. That subsided pretty quickly. Then I got really dizzy, lightheaded and warm and sweaty while waiting the 15 minutes. Then my vision started to blur and I felt tingly in both of my hands and both of my legs. According to others with me, I also went grey. I was given a cool cloth and fanned which helped with a lot of the issues. I also had my legs elevated and was given some slightly sugary food and drink to help the vaccine disperse better. Paramadics and amabulance arrived to assess me. I was improving by the time they arrived and was deemed stable, so I did not go to the hospital for this incident

Symptoms then began to slowly subside until by around 4p.m. the next day I felt mostly normal.

About 5 hours after that I got chills that made me shake all over because I got a fever of 103. Then 2 hours later my heart started to beat very rapidly and got up to 126 beats per minute, my heart was also not only beating vast but very very hard. Then throughout the night and all of the next day, I had pain in my chest on the left side and also pain in my rib area on the left side. The pain lasted for over 24 hours and because of that I went to the emergency room. It turned out they didn&#39;t find anything life threatening at the emergency room but all the pain I had was very scary and very uncomfortable. It was a terrible experience and because of it, I am telling people not to get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.

I waited about a week and the pain seemed to be spreading into my face. I started to have a headache after that and consulted my doctor. The headache and pressure in my sinuses and cheeks has been persisting for eight weeks. It happens intermittently and some days it seems to come on later in the day. The tightness in my jaw has gone away and it is a nagging headache now. When I run it seems to be a slight tightness in my sinuses. I have been using some Allergy medication and they only hep a little.

                                                At approximately 8pm the day of the vaccination, I felt fatigued. I woke up the next morning feeling like I was definitely sick with the typical symptoms. I was resting all morning on the couch at the house I was dog sitting. At around 11:30am I took my daily Claritin and two ibuprofens. At around 12:15pm, I was getting my haircut and felt like I was going to pass out. I asked the hairstylist to grab water and something to cool me off. I didn&#39;t have much control of my body, ED was called, and paramedics showed up. About 5 minutes into the incident my arms and legs started tingling and felt like someone was trying to twist my skin. An IV was put into me and about 5 minutes later I snapped out of the episode.

He laid down on the floor until his family arrived to help him get home.

                                                Patient received the Jansen covid-19 vaccine today.   he was fine when he received the vaccine but when he was sitting in the chair in the pharmacy lobby he fainted.   I saw him fall out of chair and immediately ran out the door to assist him.  He fell out of chair face down on the floor.  When I reached him I rolled him over and spoke to him and he responded to me.  I had him remain on the floor for several minutes before I had him sit in the chair.  He bit his lip and there was a spot of blood and he hit his forehead on the floor.   We called emergency number and emergency medical team arrived shortly and took his vital signs and they were normal.   He was a little clammy and sweating a little.   I gave him a bottle of cold water to drink while he was sitting.   The emergency team checked him out and they ask him if he wanted to go to hospital and he declined going.   The emergency medical team left and I had him wait a while longer.   I had him call his mother to come and pick him up so he did not have to drive himself.  His mother arrived about 20 minutes later and I went over with her what had happened.  She took him home and I called to check on him after a few hours and he said he was doing fine.   He also stated while talking with him that he had never passed out when getting other vaccines or the flu shots previously.  He did state that he didn&#39;t like needles but was not afraid to get the vaccine.

                                                After his vaccination, patient was waiting 15 minutes in waiting room. Patient knocked on door and said he didn&#39;t feel well. I closed door and turned to grab epi-pen and diphenhydramine. When I turned back around, patient fell on the floor and was unresponsive. I asked my technician to call 911. Patient regained consciousness in about 10 seconds and I told him an ambulance was coming. I observed his breathing to be normal. He sat up against the wall in a cold sweat and told me this has happened to him one time when he donated blood. The ambulance and paramedic arrived very promptly. They took him to the ambulance.
