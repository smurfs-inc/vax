                                                Patient received vaccine in the AM of 3/16/21.  Patient was in his usual state of health when he went to bed the evening of 3/16/21.  He ate dinner normally and his PD was started as usual.  There were no overnight complications with his PD and he got up shortly before 8 AM.  Mom reports the dialysate from his bag was clear and normal and none of his dwell was retained.  She heard a loud thud from the bathroom around 8 AM and the patient was found by his mother having generalized convulsions (bilateral upper and lower extremities) and he appeared to be foaming at the mouth.  He did not respond to her and she called 911. The seizure stopped by the time EMS arrived and his initial GCS was 12, and 15 by the time they started transport.  He had another seizure en route around 9:30 AM and was given 2.5 mg versed and required bagging. Patient was loaded with Keppra and now has been on maintenance Keppra. Patient has not suffered any additional seizures and is currently undergoing an extensive workup by inpatient neurology team. Vaccine adverse effect currently remains on the differential for inciting event leading to seizure however additional labs are pending to rule out other causes (eg. viruses causing PML).  Patient was also diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia and started on antibiotics at time of admission.

He convulsed for around ten seconds after about two minutes of being unconscious. Four to five healthcare workers attended to him, asking him to &#34;stay with us.&#34; They called an ambulance, and the medics monitored him for awhile. Heart rate dropped to 34 bpm, clothing drenched with perspiration. Blood sugar was slightly low, although he had eaten a late brunch of two fried eggs, sourdough toast and fruit salad. The last thing he remembers is a cold sensation shooting down his arm and into his left hand. He tried to talk to say he wasn&#39;t feeling well, but he couldn&#39;t form the words, so he raised his arm and then fainted. He felt generally unwell the rest of the day, and today he is still not fully recovered.

                                                We gave patient the vaccine and advised him to wait for the CDC recommended 15 minutes observation time. He decided to leave after just a few minutes, despite his dad (who was with him) questioning the decision and suggesting he stay 15 minutes. I was then told by a member of management through our walkie-talkie system that they needed me at the front register immediately because someone passed out after getting a vaccine. I was there within the minute with my vaccine emergency bag. Upon arriving, the patient was already awake, talking, and sitting in a chair. He also was profusely sweating. He stated he&#39;s never experienced anything like this before. He said he normally has low blood pressure. He starting drinking some water. When I checked his blood pressure it was so low the machine gave an error message. Throughout this time, the patient progressively was feeling better and eventually wound up laughing and smiling. Him and his father said that he would be ok and that he was feeling himself. I told him to sit for a bit more before leaving and stay as long as he wants. I called him later that evening to check on him and had to leave a voicemail. His father called back 2 days later and said he&#39;s been fine.

                                                After a few hours, developed a low grade headache and some soreness at the injection site.  About two hours later I started getting extremely cold, despite the temperature in the mid-high 70s. I covered up under blankets. I began feeling very tired and a general sick feeling. After about an hour and a half of progressively worse chills and cold sweat, I began to get very very hot and removed all blankets and eventually clothes. I took my temperature, which was at 102 f. At this point I drank some water and Gatorade and waited for it to pass. I also noticed that my Apple Watch heart rate detection was saying my heart rate was in the high 90s to low 100s despite me just laying in bed. This was alarming because my typical resting heart rate is in the low 60s. About two hours later I felt well enough to at least brush my teeth, but upon standing up was greeted with an extreme feeling of weakness and dizziness and it was hard to keep myself up right. I eventually was able to fall asleep, and upon waking up, felt better, but still not great. My heart rate was more normal at this point, I no longer had chills or a fever, but still had a headache and soreness across my body, worst at the injection site.

He was cold and clammy. He never lost consciousness.  It took him a couple  minutes to &#34;come back&#34; to alertness and feel better.   Severe headache, chills starting and began asthma symptoms (wheezing) at 11;30pm the night of the injection.. 2 extra strength Tylenol did not help. He was very cold and the headache did not let up after several hours.  Eventually he had a bout of sweats and he reports he was soaked.  In the morning, at 8 am the headache was still severe...was sensitive to noise, light and touch. He was given 2 extra strength Tylenol at 8 and then 2 Advil at 10am, which finally began to reduce symptoms. He was not hungry, felt weak, and finally by late night he was feeling better.  In the morning on Saturday he awoke with a swollen left eye and blood shot in that eye.

Patient came to immediately and was conscious by the time the pharmacist reached the patient. Patient was ok other than having a sore head from when he fell. We provided the patient water and continued to monitor for an additional amount of time for a total of 30 minutes. Patient denied needing anything else such as juice. Patient was okay after and when asked if there was anyone that he could contact to drive with, he said he was okay to drive after.

                                                Patient felt light headed and dizzy and passed out briefly following administration of vaccine. Patient had history of passing out during vaccination and blood draws. Patient felt sweaty and turned white. His color returned after a minute, I talked to his mother who was there during the incident. Did not eat or drink the morning of vaccine. I checked his pulse and blood pressure and it was 129/72 and pulse of 78. We gave him some water and orange juice. He felt much better. Then his mom bought him some muffins. He sat and ate for about 30 minutes and left feeling back to normal.

To my knowledge, I hadn?t in any way performed stressful or repetitive behaviors leading up to the symptoms; I had been bedridden with the vaccine side-effects and was too exhausted to do much of anything.

                                                Patient reported running a fever last night after getting vaccinated yesterday afternoon. She did not have any rashes on her face till she threw up this afternoon and then she stated that she had rashes all over her face and it was itchy. I advised her to take some antihistamine and she had cetirizine 10mg at home and she took one tablet. And then I advised her to go to the ER.

For a point of reference, I can barely taste anything when I swish mouthwash around in my mouth.

Hurt more than the joint pain or headache I also have (but those are common side effects).

Approx 9 hours after vaccination (around 9:00 pm), he had 100.2* F fever, and took 1000 mg of acetaminophen.   Approx 3 hours later (12:30 pm), his fever was 102* F, and he took another 1000 mg of acetaminophen.   Approx 2 hours later (after 2:00 am), his fever apparently broke as he was sweating.   Approx 3 hours after that (5:30 am), his temperature was 98.4* and he was more comfortable.  24 hours after vaccination, he is afebrile but still complains of malaise.

He declined to having us call for medical help.

My technician asked if he was doing ok and he replied &#34;no.&#34; I then went out and asked what symptoms he was having. He said he was having headache, dizziness, and didn&#39;t feel well. I then stayed with him to monitor him, at which point his arms fell, I was able to lay him on the ground with an associates help without his head hitting the ground. Code white was called and store management came to the scene. Patient regained consciousness, remained on the ground for a few minutes and then said he wanted to sit up. We helped him into a chair, a few moments later, he lost consciousness again. We then laid the patient down one more time and the instore officer requested a squad.  Patient was monitored until they arrived and took over.

He experienced vertigo as well as nausea. He tried to text and it came out as a jumble of misspelled words and letters. He called me, his mother, and he was extremely hard to understand and couldn&#39;t say a complete sentence without using words that made no sense. Him being in college I was 1.5 hours away. We were able to contact a friend of his and she was able to go to his dorm room and they called the campus on call nurse line. After speaking with her she instructed them to call 911 because she thought he could possibly be having a stroke. Patient was transported by ambulance to ER.

I had a tough time moving throughout my room and could barely get up from bed. It felt similar to having a severe fever. However, these symptoms diminished throughout the night and I only felt a slight weakness going into the next day. The severity of these symptoms decreased throughout the day but remained in the background for a while.

I had a fever of 102 and was constantly switching between chills and sweating through my sheets. The room felt like it was spinning and I felt like I was going to puke. Lastly I started to get chest pain which was by far the most concerning part to me. I still have a headache and chills but the fever is gone, and I am recovering

Throughout night woke up many times with same symptoms. At 6:00 AM woke up for good with a 102 fever, migraine, soreness, chills, and no energy. At 8:00 AM the fever got up to 103°F. I then took Tylenol and the fever slowly started to subside but the migraine, soreness, and lack of energy stayed. As of Tuesday, two days after the vaccine, symptoms have gone away.

                                                Severe arm pain/low swelling in arm area. Nausea. Pain near liver area. General fatigue. Mental cloudiness. Random bouts of tinnitus in both ears, switching off, never both ears at once. The arm pain and swelling in shot area lasted about two days,  but the nausea, ;over pain, and fatigue continued for the better part of 4 days after the shot. The tinnitus only happened a couple times about 1-3 hours after the vaccination then ceased. I did not get this verified by a doctor, but I suspect my liver pain was related to an inflammation in the liver associated with the vaccine, as in the past, pain around my liver area has been associated with inflammation of my liver during minor flare ups.

He reported that he felt hot and sweaty and lightheaded. He appeared distressed. We called 911, then we provided a client with a cold pack. His pulse was 47 bpm and his spO2 was 97%. He continued to state that he was lightheaded so we had him lay down on the ground and take deep breaths. EMS arrived the collected his vitals which were WNL. His blood glucose was 71. He was warm and moist to the touch. EMS stayed with the client until 1350 at which point he had sat up and sat in the chair. He said he was definitely not having trouble breathing anymore and was feeling better. Provided client with a juice box and water. Client stayed onsite until 1410 at which point he said he felt comfortable leaving.  Client walked unassisted out of the clinic.

Heart rate (normally 60) spiked to 140 and could not see fit five seconds, had to call ambulance. Ambulance determined much of it was due to anxiety (multiple exams and significant work were due soon), and recommended medical supervision to ensure it did not escalate. Went to urgent care and was supervised until 1 pm, 24 hours after the vaccination, by which time symptoms had subsided

                                                High fever, extreme shaking and chills, nausea. I was pretty much immobile from 11pm-3am (until I was able to fall asleep) on the day of vaccination (3/8/21). This happened immediately after I showered with hot water. The next day  (3/9/21) until around 8pm I had a high fever, chills (not as bad but still pretty bad), headache, nausea, fatigue, and extreme muscle/joint pain particularly in my back and arms. I was unable to work, go to school, or do homework the entire day. After 8pm, I was down to a 100.4 fever and slight chills with mild nausea and fatigue. Today (3/10/21), I have mild muscle pain in my back and near the injection site. I took 400mg of ibuprofen every 6-8 hours from 3:00pm 3/8/21 (day of injection) to present with mild effects on pain and fever levels. I?m an infrequent user of ibuprofen. If I didn?t have someone with me the first night after the vaccination (3/8/21) I would have gone to the hospital.

                                                Immediately had a dull headache. About an hour and a half just didn&#39;t feel well and became very tired where he was dozing off.  About 7:00 pm started to shake.  This continued to get worse with severe jerking along with the uncontrollable shaking.  Had a rapid resting heart rate over 142 and a fever at 102.4.  Was incoherent, mumbling his words and not making any sense. Went to ER at 8:48 pm they did blood work, urine test and started an IV.  They weren&#39;t sure what was going on and first accused of doing drugs then wanted to do a spinal tap. His father stopped that and again told them it was from the covid vaccine. They finally gave him a shot of Ketorolac 30mg and LORazepan 1 mg. They sent him home and told him to take tylenol for his fever. spontaneous shaking kept on until late 3/11, along with a fever.  Friday 3/12 he is feeling better, fever has broke but not quite 100%.

                                                Patient was administered Janssen COVID vaccine. Patient was fine immediately post administration in the IMZ room but witness stated he fell sideways (within a few minutes of receiving the vaccine) out of post-administration observation chair (which is in front of the pharmacy). Technician called code white and patient was immediately met with management and the pharmacy team. Patient was laying on his stomach on the floor, supporting himself upward with both hands/forearms. Patient had blood dripping from forehead and nose. Gauze was applied to laceration on forehead to help with bleeding and once patient was able to roll over on his back, an ice pack was applied to his forehead/nose area. Patient said he felt &#34;pain&#34; after the injection and then he felt light-headed. He remembered blacking out for a few seconds. Patient stated he felt &#34;ok&#34;, then later stated he felt better but just had a bad headache. Patient stated he felt &#34;it starting to hurt&#34; and that it triggered his anxiety. Dad was in the store and arrived a few minutes later; dad said son/patient has a &#34;fear of needles&#34; and &#34;he hasn&#39;t had anything to eat today in quite awhile&#34;. EMS arrived to examine patient and asked him if he needed to go to the ER; dad felt going to the ER was for the best since they had a 3 hour car ride home. Paramedics then transported patient to the ER and said he would likely need a stitch for the cut above his eyebrow.

I thought nothing of this until around 7:30 where I began to have extreme chills and a headache. Around 9:00, I tried to get some water and I was too dizzy to walk at any normal pace. I took my temperature and it read at 101.9F. I proceeded to take ibuprofen, drink lots of water (about 80 oz that night), and go to sleep as best as I could.

                                                Around approximately 9:30PM on April 10th, I started to experience chills that got progressively worse throughout the night. No amount of layers seemed to help.  Approximately 30min later I began to have a fever and a rapid heart beat started which led to chest pains . The chest pains subsided throughout the night, but the fever and chills lasted to around 11:00 AM, April 11th. I also had a bad headache from approximately  7AM to 10AM. Theses symptoms stopped around 11:00AM April 11th. Around 12 hours later I started experiencing chills and a fever again, however, these symptoms were less severe than the night before and subsided throughout the night.

I had a severe migraine the night of and severe body aching to where I was just laying in bed crying. Saturday, 4/10/2021 I felt okay. Sunday 4/11/2021 I felt perfect and thought I was okay. This morning, Monday 4/12/2021 I woke up at 4am in a puddle of sweat, and started puking at 530am. I puked at least every hour multiple times. My whole body felt as if it was vibrating, or falling asleep (the worst feeling I&#39;ve ever had.)

                                                It is now the next day, and I feel significantly better. I have pain at the injection site, some muscle fatigue, a little bit of a depleted appetite, tiredness in my eyes and head (likely due to lack of quality sleep), and a bit of sweating, but my pain has reduced to maybe a 2/10 or 1/10 (i.e., not even uncomfortable). I did end up getting decent sleep between 2 AM and 12 PM with only a few interruptions of family members checking on me. The only notable pain that is worrying me is abnormal soreness in my right wrist that is not the result of overuse, overextension, etc., although I was able to take care of that pain with another 3 Advil pills. I am considering scheduling a doctor&#39;s appointment, as I know the J&amp;J vaccine got recalled today for blood clots. My assumption is that because I am a healthy 20-year-old, my immune system overreacted to the vaccine, but I want to check to make sure that it doesn&#39;t cause any additional health problems.

                                                The patient had a needle phobia and was very anxious prior to the vaccine. Once the patient received the vaccine, he waited in the waiting area for 15 minutes post-vaccine. About 5 minutes after the vaccine, he notified the pharmacy staff that he wasn&#39;t feeling well and he was feeling faint. The pharmacy staff provided him with a glass of water and was monitoring him. He said he  felt like he fainted and wasn&#39;t feeling well. He said he felt warm and sweaty. The pharmacy staff provided him with an ice pack. He then notified the pharmacy staff that he urinated in his chair while waiting post-vaccine. He wanted to be checked out and wanted us to call 911 . The patient began to feel better after about 20 minutes. The EMT arrived and checked the patient. Even though, the patient was feeling better, the EMT recommended the patient be checked further anyways. He was brought to the Triage center and was there for about 1 hour, according to the patient, and was feeling better. He said he felt slightly fatigued that day and the following day, but other than that he was feeling back to normal and no issues. He stated he has severe needle phobia and has experienced these fainting spells and anxiousness in the past. We followed up with the patient and he provided this information to us. He stated he was feeling good and back to normal. He had no further questions or concerns. We told him to follow up with us if questions or concerns came up.

Splotches were dark purple.  Went to clinic, they were unsure of the cause.  Waited a day and then went to another clinic where they thought it might be Coxsackievirus, except there were no sores in the mouth and the splotches were on the palms and pads of the feet.  The splotches faded over the next 2 weeks, the last place they were visible were on the upper arm,  torso and thighs.

She happened to be off today and was home with her son.  She stated that the seizure was like a Grand Mal seizure that lasted approximately 5 minutes. She stated that he has had a diabetic seizure before when his blood glucose levels were low.  She stated his blood glucose was 71.  She said this was different, he had no residual after effects. He was not incontinent of bowel or bladder and he woke up quickly afterwards.  About an hour after the seizure he ate and only complained of a headache.  She gave him ibuprofen 600 mg and he put an ice pack on his head.  She said he is better. She stated that she is a nurse and this really scared her, since it was so different than any other seizure he has ever had.  She was thankful she was home.  She call his primary healthcare provider and she did  not feel he needed to be seen.

                                                About 9 hours after receiving the vaccine (around 2am) I had a fever, chills, headache, sore arm, and muscle soreness. I fell back asleep and when I woke up the fever had broken and the chills had improved but the soreness and headache remained. I took Tylenol in the afternoon and that helped the symptoms but by the time I had gone to bed the chills had returned but not a fever. When I woke up in the middle of the night (night 2) the chills had stopped and I woke up with a moderate headache and sweating profusely. After falling asleep and awaking in the morning I felt much better with the exception of a minor headache.

                                                The patient began experiencing nausea and light-headedness around 11:00 P.M. on the 6th of April. Three hours later, he reported lower back pain that steadily increased in severity over the course of several hours. Throughout that same night, severe headaches and impaired kidney capacity (i.e. constant need to urinate about every hour) kept him from sleeping longer than two or three hours. Come morning of the 7th (roughly 8:30 A.M.), he took a single capsule of ibuprofen and performed various lower back stretches in addition to walking around the house. During this time, he experienced a gradual decrease in symptoms and was able to eat a small meal. The patient returned to bed two hours after taking the medication and slept without any further interruptions.

At 3 am headache was migraine strength and was having full body aches (except for arms), extreme lower back and lower abdominal pain (he said it must be like what women experience in labor or during their menstrual cycle).   He got up and took temperature (normal) and blood ox (100 %SpO2 on two fingers).  He got a wet rag for eyes and tried to fall asleep.  He said he felt hot with cover on and cold with cover off.   At 5:50 am his father gave him two Motrin (400mg total), applesauce and a ice pack for his head and back.  I checked on him thru-out day and he seemed restless.  He woke up at 3 pm on 4/8/2021 said headache and major back pain/abdominal pains were gone. He still feels slightly achy, but fine otherwise. as of 8:24 pm.

                                                1. Vasovagal syncope almost immediately after vaccination, little to no warning of oncoming syncope 2. Extremely fast acting fever (temperature went from 98.6 to 100.5 in roughly 30 minutes) followed by nausea, pounding headache, and body aches/chills. Remedied by alternating very high doses of ibuprofen (800mg) and acetaminophen (1000mg or 1g) every two to three hours. This did not ever bring down the fever below 100 degrees. 3. Blurred vision around 29 hours after vaccine - advised to go to ER by triage nurse. ER doctor determined not to worry about, likely due to headache but not 100% sure.

He then had chills, fever of 101.2.  His pulse stayed at 95-100 beats per minute for 2 hours.  I spoke to a nurse friend of mine who told me to give him Tylenol and Benadryl.  His pulse went down to 80 beats per minute.  His fever went higher during the night but eventually broke.  Next morning he was still running a low grade fever and took Tylenol the rest of day.  He also had diarrhea on 2nd day and exhaustion.  3rd day feeling better but still tired.  No fever or diarrhea today.

Tuesday after the vaccine I got diarrhea with constipation along side the fatigue. Those symptoms lasted throughout Thursday. Friday night after the vaccine I got small haves around my head, neck, and upper back that would not away after an hour or two. That continued throughout Saturday and midday trough Sunday. Sunday I had shortness of breath after moving some water bottle cases around and lightheadedness along with the small hives at around 2pm I went to the ER to get checked out. Doctors said it was a reaction caused  by the vaccine. They gave me Benadryl for the reaction and injected me with a &#34;Steroid&#34; to the my upper buttock. I don&#39;t remember the name of what they injected with me. It is now Monday April 19th a day after the ER and I feel much better. The Benadryl made the  hives go away.

I had already instructed him to sit on the floor if he started feeling faint  as he stated previous fainting episodes as a kid. He sat on the floor, then laid on the floor. I brought him a garbage can in case he got sick, an ice pack, wet paper towels, and a bottle of water. After 5 minutes or so the color came back to his face and he started feeling much better. He then sat back in the chair, then stood up and stated he was feeling back to normal. I asked him to stay standing an extra minute just to make sure he was good, then he left with the woman who was with him during the vaccine.

I went to bed early that day around 10PM. Woke up around 1:30AM on the 4th. Felt terrible and took my temperature. It read 101.5. Got up to use restroom and when washing hands, everything started to go blurry, I thought i had just become lightheaded and that it would pass so i stood there leaning against the bathroom door.I  ended up fainting and hitting my head on the cabinets. I was completely soaked in sweat.  An hour later we drove to the ER to make sure everything as okay. IV was started, some test performed, and fever was gone by 5AM. Felt completely fine after going home and resting for a few hours.

                                                12 hours after receiving vaccine I got sharp pains in back and legs. Burning sensation all over body. I was walking across my room and passed out waking up on the floor. Muscle cramps and tightness followed this.  I could not move my muscles for roughly 12 hours. After 24 hours from receiving vaccine these extreme symptoms seemed to fade and I was left with fatigue, soreness and fever as expected. This lasted for the next 3 days

                                                The patient (self) felt a soreness around the site of the injection begin immediately and grow throughout the day. The soreness continued to at least April 12 (at the time of this report). The soreness was immediate unlike a tetanus shot but the pain the following days was 2-3 times less that of a tetanus shot. By 4pm the same day, the patient felt fatigue and tired and had difficulty staying awake. Around 6pm the patient took 200 mg of ibuprofen by mouth because of a strong headache. At 7pm the patient was experiencing the following: headache, warm head to the touch, shivering/shaking,  fatigue, mild aching. The patients pulse was consistent 100-104 bpm. The patients temperature at 8:30pm was 100.4 F. The patient then went to bed at 9pm. Patient had trouble falling asleep due to fever, shaking, aching. The patient slept intermittently until midnight. At midnight, the patient noticed the fever and shaking had ceased but the headache and aching were still strong. The aching was all over the body. The patients eyes hurt to move. The aching was constant and at times was throbbing. At 3am the patient could still not sleep well so he took 650 mg of Acetaminophen by mouth. The patient began to notice some relief approximately 30-60 min after. The patient fell asleep after the relief began and slept soundly til 9:15 am, April 11th. The patient awoke feeling much better. All side effects had stopped with the exception of a feeling of weakness and slight dizziness. The patient was able to carry on normally and took no more medications.

                                                Around 6:15 PM the day of the vaccine, began to experience chills and a headache. I also became very dehydrated quickly and started to rest. I woke up around 8:30PM the same day with a fever of 102.7F, but no longer had chills. The headache had gotten worse and I took Ibuprofen to help the fever and headache. I feel back asleep until 11:30PM the same day when I was feeling better and had come down from my fever. I slept the rest of the night and woke up feeling dehydrated still and tired. When looking at my Apple Watch, my heart rate jumped to 90-120 BPM when the symptoms started and stayed around there until when I woke up the next day. The symptoms ran their course and I did not have any other events until April 13th, 3 days after the vaccine when I developed a dry cough.

My entire body felt like burning and a headache came up not long after the fever.  I could barely fall asleep at night due to body ache and excessive sweating. The headache and body pain persisted till the next morning, and as of I am writing this response now, I feel extremely weak and I have no appetite at all.

Once I awoke at around 6pm, I had irritated eyes, extreme nausea, extreme dizziness, insatiably low body temperature, extreme shivers, migraine because of my head uncontrollably shaking, and dry mouth. I felt like I was in 20 degree weather and nothing I could do would heat my body up. My body grew so tired from the uncontrollable shaking that I could not get out of bed to get my phone to call 911. Every symptom I was experiencing was not mild and was to the level of extreme. This lasted until around 9am. I have been slowly recovering since then (currently almost 9pm) and feel only 70% back to normal.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.  The vaccine was given at 10:45 AM. At 4:00 PM I began feeling nauseous. At 9:00 or 10:00 PM I began feeling both muscle and joint pain on my upper body which made it somewhat difficult to sleep. After one or two hours of sleep at 1:00 AM I woke up with a fever, headache, and worse muscle and joint pain (upper body only). When I woke up I was sweating profusely that the bed was lightly wet and extremely hot from all the heat my body was letting go. An ice pack can relieve the headache and fever. However, I was still not able to sleep. At 4:00 AM I made the decision to consume 800 mg of ibuprofen and it took 20 minutes for my headache and fever to go away. Yet, after being able to sleep for 30 minutes, I woke up again to the same headache and fever. Around 10:00 AM the symptoms were partly gone and was finally able to get sleep after a long night.

It&#39;s been going on for close to over a month and I&#39;m currently taking Acid Reflux medication, Vomiting and Nausea medication after going to the a gastroenterologist to which they didn&#39;t find anything doing an endoscopy that occurred on April 12th, 2021. Still waiting on the biopsy. With medication, current only symptom is painful stool (due to medication most likely) and after eating, burning in the throat (most likely due to acid reflux type symptoms). Only able to eat a certain amount before throwing up again.

                                                Patient was visibly nervous prior to receiving the vaccine. About 5 minutes after administration (during the 15 minute watch period), patient appeared to be slumped over in the chair. He had eyes closed and seemed to be shaking slightly. Pharmacist and tech grabbed the emergency kit and laid patient on the floor. After a few more seconds the patient woke up and was able to respond to questions. He was very pale, sweaty, reported feeling clammy and dizzy. Patient claimed he had not eaten since the morning. We gave him some water and a pb&amp;j sandwich. Patient stated he felt better and he just gets very nervous around needles. The patient sat with us for another 30 minutes until his grandmother and cousin were able to come pick him up from the pharmacy.

                                                Pt and his mother went to their car after vaccination.  After about 5 minutes, mom beeped the horn, so myself and another nurse, RN., ran to the car.  Once arriving there, pt was in the passenger seat, appearing pale, and mom said he was not feeling well.  Reclined the seat fully had had him lay back.  VSS.  Never lost consciousness.  Pt had not eaten nor drunk anything before his appt at 12:15 pm.  Gave him some water and crackers with peanut butter.  Within 5 minutes, pt&#39;s color returned and he stated he was feeling better.  Mom was going to take him to get some lunch in a drive-thru.  No further issues at this time.

About 10 - 15 minutes later the pt was feeling light headed, nauseous, sweaty, and felt like he was going to faint. I attended to the patient, laid him on the ground bein case he fainted (which he did not), put his feet up, and asked him how he was feeling. The pt stated he felt better after laying down for a couple minutes and sat back up in his chair. I gave the pt the pt water and Gatorade and told the pt he would need to hang out for about 15 minutes longer. Pt stated he felt fine and 100% and requested to leave.

Patient asked for a glass of water. When getting the patient water my technician said she saw the patients eyes roll to the back of his head and that he was going to pass out. I went out to the patient and helped him to the ground and had him lay flat on his back with his feet elevated. After 3-4 minutes the patient was feeling better. Patient never lost consciousness.

                                                Starting about 12 hours after my vaccine, I started to feel fatigue and body aches.  An hour after that I experienced intense chills and a sense of dread. I put a heater on myself with two layers of thick blankets, but it didn&#39;t help. My fingers and parts of my face started to tingle and go numb and I couldn&#39;t fall asleep in spite of me doing breathing exercises and lying down. Eventually the chills turned into a fever and my body temperature suddenly shot up. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer, but it was certainly over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Despite my relief from the chills, I still couldn&#39;t sleep.  I wasn&#39;t remarkably stressed/anxious, I just couldn&#39;t get to sleep. I&#39;m not typically an insomniac, and upon speaking to others who received the same vaccine, they&#39;ve also reported intense chills and an inability to fall asleep.

The next morning (Sunday) I woke up with a fever, chills, sweats, and fatigue that lasted until about 24 hours after I received the vaccine. The following day (Monday) I felt completely fine and had no adverse symptoms or side effects. Tuesday was fine as well until about 2pm after I ate lunch, during a meeting my arm went numb as well as my legs and I had trouble concentrating and could not hold a conversation. Went home and slept until Wednesday morning. Today, Wednesday, I am still not feeling normal and am having trouble concentrating at work, low light seems to help. No numbness today but still feel dazed and not able to focus

At 14 hours after vaccination, major aches and soreness, chills and fever rose to 101.2. By 1:00am fever had reached 103.0F (all temperatures taken with ear thermometer). I took 1000mg of Tylenol at that time, which greatly reduced the aches and pains. Woke up with a temp of 99.2, minor aches, almost all effects had subsided.

Nausea lasted approximately 30 minutes, trembling lasted about 45 minutes.  Important to note that I previously had COVID-19 60-70 days prior to vaccination. The symptoms from the vaccine were significantly worse; however, they appear to have lasted for a much shorter period.

Upon check-out he stated he was &#34;starting to feel sweaty&#34;.  He denied dizziness, difficulty breathing, chest pain or other concerns.  Systolic blood pressure was 76/40 (manual), heart rate 70.  He remained awake, alert, skin pale,  clammy,  &amp; cool.  Sweat noted on forehead, in no acute distress.  He was transferred to supine position and given cold water.  BP increased to 124/82, heart rate 88, pulse ox 98%.  He verbalized he felt much better, stated he began to have concerns about a reaction when he began to feel sweaty.  He was unsure if it was anxiety or a reaction to the vaccine as the feelings began to escalate.  He has no history of similar reactions but &#34;doesn&#39;t like shots&#34;.    He has no medical history, takes no medications/supplements and is otherwise &#34;healthy&#34;.  He ate lunch prior to appointment.

I woke up at 4:30am the morning after receiving the vaccine needing to use the restroom, but I could barely get out of bed because of my severe body aches and lack of energy. When I did manage to get out of bed, I struggled to even stand up. I took 800mg of ibuprofen at that time (around 4:30am) for the pain, which helped. I spent more than the first half of my day in bed under layers of blankets until about 3:00pm, where I finally felt good enough to get out of bed. I didn?t feel the body aches completely go away until the morning of the 8th, 3 days after receiving the vaccine.

It appears to be concentrated in my left ear, although it&#39;s hard to tell. There&#39;s a consistent high-pitched tone that won&#39;t go away. I&#39;m not entirely sure when it started (maybe 24-36 hours after receiving the vaccine), but it&#39;s gotten slightly worse since then and is more noticeable. I have not been able to go to the doctor yet.

Patient was consulted about what to expect, side effects, and asked if he had any additional questions prior to receiving vaccination.  Patient declined and said he wanted to have the vaccine administered.  Patient sat down in the designated waiting area.  Approximately 2-5 minutes later patient blacked out and his body weight caused the chair he was sitting in to flip over, thus landing on the floor.  EMS was called.  Patient came to about 30-60 seconds later.  Patient was disoriented, sweaty, pale, and shaky.  Blood pressure was taken with a result of 143/95.  EMS arrived and evaluated the patient.  Patient admitted to having nothing to eat or drink today and being very anxious previous to getting the vaccine.  There were no signs of an allergic reaction.  Patient&#39;s blood pressure was checked about 20 minutes later and was returning towards normal.  Patient declined transport to the hospital, but mother was called to come pick him up.  Patient was advised to get something to eat soon and to rest and be observed for the next 24 hours.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At 11 PM the night of the vaccine (Saturday), extremely bad chills, fever and weakness set in almost immediately. I could not get my body to warm up and was borderline too weak to walk. Very bad headache and nausea set in as well.  After several hours the chills turned to intermittent sweating/cold and I could not keep a consistent body temp, nor sleep that night. The next morning  (Sunday) I had very bad aches and soreness, along with chills/fever and headaches that could be managed fine with around the clock acetaminophen. Around 8 PM that night, most of these flu like symptoms subsided. The following morning (Monday), still very exhausted despite a full 10 hours sleep. Tiredness and weakness lasted through the day. Tuesday morning until around 3 PM i still experienced drowsiness and was unable to gain strength for anything more than typical day to day tasks (could not workout). Wednesday morning, felt normal but while exercising experienced shortness of breath almost immediately as well as chest/lung pain easily. Come Thursday I feel 90% normal.

I had a fever of 101 all day long, a headache, my body was aching from head to toe, extreme lethargy, and occasional bouts of extreme nausea as well as throwing up twice. As of the following day (March 18), almost two days since receiving the shot, I feel pretty much completely normal again aside from a slight headache and some pain at the injection site still. I experienced some pretty bad side effects that only really lasted a day.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Roughly 1 hour after vaccination I started to experience nausea and fatigue. The fatigue continued for several hours until about 6-8 hours after vaccination. At that point I started to experience chills, muscle aches, and rash on my left arm (at injection site region) and over other parts of my body. Temperature at that time was still within normal range but close to 10 hours after I began to run a fever. Highest temperature at its peak was 100.3F. These symptoms continued into the night but began to considerably subside in the morning, close to 24 hours after vaccination. At this point, 26 hours after, I still feel mild muscle aches and a mild headache.

                                                At roughly 6 days after vaccination my body developed Hives head to toe. Roughly 18 or so hours after initial hive development I sought treatment for a anaphylactic reaction in my throat and face area. I received a steroid and a Pepcid to calm it down, and was given an epi pen and sent on my way. The following now two plus weeks since then I&#39;ve had episodes of dizziness, shortness of breath and headaches that seem to be constant. There has been almost no relief from these symptoms, however the rash has completely resided. I&#39;ve taken an Aspirin in the mornings to deal with the headaches but strenuous activity seems to bring these on much more prominently.

                                                At roughly 4pm the day of vaccine I started to feel generally sore in my muscles. At around 7pm I started to become light headed, had a headache, and bad muscle pain. My fever at this point measured 102f. These negative effects increased over the next few hours until I fell on the floor and couldn&#39;t get up without help from my wife. I felt like I was going to pass out every five seconds, threw up twice, my muscles kept contracting and relaxing and were intensely painful. Around 12:30am Saturday morning we went to the emergency department. I needed a wheelchair to get around. The wait at emergency was too long, and by 3am we went back home. I was feeling slightly better, but still not great, and my fever had reduced. I rested on Saturday with less severe but still considerable symptoms, and took paracetamol. Now on Sunday I feel sick and a little sore and very tired, but mostly better.

He approached the counter a few minutes later to report he wasn&#39;t feeling well.  As he was speaking with the technician he became very pale, reported lightheadedness and fainted with loss of consciousness.  The technician reported that he witnessed convulsive type tonic movements concentrated in the neck and upper-arms more than the abdomen or legs.  He also reported foaming at the mouth and following each event which repeated 3 times in less then 15 minutes,  he woke with confusion and no memory of where he was.  EMS arrived after 15 minutes and transported the patient to the ED for evaluation.    Upon follow up with the patient the next day, he reported that the ED found nothing on his medical exam and he had worked a 10 hour shift prior to receiving the vaccine and had had nothing to eat or drink.

                                                Worst headache I?ve ever had (8 out of 10 pain scale), could not sleep due to the headache, very lightheaded, entire body ached (could barely move), eyes hurt, highest fever temp 102.8, nausea (at times I thought that I may have to puke). These symptoms lasted all night, but felt better in the morning. These symptoms were like COVID but x5. When I had the COVID-19 virus, my symptoms were not as bad as yesterday?s adverse effects from the vaccine. At 3 AM, I was considering going to the hospital and I have never been hospitalized before. I could barely open my eyes since the headache was so bad.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Starting on 4/11/21 at around 12:00 pm I started to have a numbness on both sides of my face. It felt as though there were pins and needles throughout my face. I would say that it was a 4/10 in terms of intensity. At first I thought maybe it was due to drinking coffee without food or other water (I don&#39;t regularly drink coffee but I have never had these symptoms from coffee before). However, even after eating food and drinking a sugary drink around 4:00 pm, the pins and needles remained. The symptoms began to subside at 6 pm or 7 pm.  The only other normal symptoms that I had were feeling tired on 4/8/21 and 4/9/21. Also, on 4/9/21 I had very slight muscle soreness throughout my body. I have also had difficulty concentrating which may or may not be related.

                                                (Saturday)When I came home after I received the vaccine I didn&#39;t really have anything to do, so I decided to take a nap and rest. I think after I woke up is when I started to feel the side effects. I can&#39;t remember exactly but I started feeling cold. I didn&#39;t think too much of it I just thought it was a cold day (which was quickly turning to night). Later that night I started feelinga bit dizzy and my head was hot but I still had chills. Since I had a had a blanket with me, and I think I was starting to feel what would become muscle aches, I just didn&#39;t want to move from the couch to my room. Feeling chills the rest of the night, I realized it was bad choice, since one of my family members left a window open. The cold air of the night really exacerbated my chills. Despite the cold I was still able to sleep, but the next day (Sunday) I did have a slight cough which I think was from experiencing the cold air of the night and not a side effect from the vaccine. (Sunday) This is when I really felt all the side effects. I felt weak, chills, headache, dizziness, muscle aches,(I&#39;m not sure if I had a fever, I couldn&#39;t think clearly my head felt hot). I haven&#39;t had a hangover but I think that is what it would feel like to have one. I basically slept most of day Sunday ; This time in my room with  3 blankets (light blankets )and heat up (felt like 80°F under blankets). I was sweating under the blankets but it really helped warm me up and alleviate my chills. I woke up later that day to a call to help my sister with some work. I couldn&#39;t drive, felt weak and dehydrated(dark orange/yellow pee), but she insisted so she picked me up and scolded me for not eating anything all day(besides the side effects I mention, I think I may have also lost my appetite because I felt dizzy). I was still feeling my head aching after I woke up, still had muscle aches and a slight cough too. It was raining that day so I put on a winter coat with layers underneath to help with my chills. At her home she gave me a Gatorade (and water) which I think really helped since I was sweating a lot under the blankets when I fell asleep. She also gave me some home cooked meals she made. The combination of drinks, food, and familial concern really helped me recover. By Monday my cough was gone and the side effects had worn off to the point that I could go to work safely.   My mother &amp; father also received vaccine at the same time I got it. My father also experienced side effects but his started later with the most effects felt on Tuesday. My mother did not get any side effects.

The headache went away before the appointment (did not take any medication); however the headache returned about 10 minutes after I got vaccinated. A few hours later the headache converted to a migraine resulting in increased nausea. Overnight I developed a fever. Within 24 hours, all the symptoms were gone. At this time I have fully recovered from all side effects but am monitoring my heath to see if anything else comes up.

                                                During the observation period, the patient became lightheaded and dizzy.  He complained of sweating and cold skin.  The pharmacist immediately went to the aide of the patient.  The patient was laid on the ground and we began to get a blood pressure reading.  We also gave the patient cold pack to place on the skin.  The patient never lost consciousness and was verbal and responding to pharmacist questions the entire time.  We asked multiple times if he needed EMS and he each time told us he did not.  His status continued to improve with deep breaths and cooling the skin.  After 10-15 minutes he felt like he could sit up in the chair and did just fine and continued to recover.  We kept watch over him.

Less than 5 minutes after recieving the vaccine he stated he was not feeling well, I noticed that he had perspiration on his forehead. I gave him a small cup of water, he immediately vomited both the water and contents of his stomach. I gave him a bottle of water. He continued to sit near the pharmacy for roughly 45 minutes after which he stated he was feeling much better and left for home.

Went to bed around 10:30 and woke up about 3 hours later at 1:30. Had chills and was shaking when I got up. Could not really fall back asleep. Chills turned into a fever. That morning I started to get a headache. I sounded congested at one point, but no runny nose. I also had body and joint aches.  I took Excedrin three times that day. Once in the morning, once in the afternoon, once before bed. I used zquil to sleep a little bit in the afternoon and again at night. I woke up Sunday and felt completely fine except for my arm still being sore.

OTC fever reducers helped bring the fever down eventually. The entire day (3/20) my fever was on and off and nausea would also be present. Bouts  of feeling well and bouts of fever. Had a minor fever when going to sleep that day and the fever was gone when waking up on 3/21. So ~24 hours of side effects.

Took 3 Tylenol at around 3:00 AM when it became clear I was not well. Fell asleep around 5:00 AM after Tylenol kicked in and got super hot instead of super cold. Woke up around 11:00 AM with no fever, but slightly achy. Aches went away by nighttime, and felt 100% the next morning, April 3rd.

                                                Patient stated they didn&#39;t feel well at all and was sweating.  I told him I should give him an Epi Pen, but he preferred receiving generic Benadryl. At approximately 12:50pm he was given 50mg of diphenhydramine since he wasn&#39;t having any swelling to inhibit swallowing. He drank half the bottle of water. He stated his vision was spotty, but getting better. I told him we should give him the epi pen and call 911.  He asked us to call girlfriend to let her know he wasn&#39;t feeling well. After another few minutes he stated his vision was getting better and feeling much better. At 1:12 we took his blood pressure 102/67 pulse of 47.  He stated the pressure and pulse were normal for him since he is a runner.  (He had run a marathon the previous weekend). He was monitored for 30 minutes.  After the 30 minutes, he felt fairly normal and was going to be with someone the rest of the day working at home. He was given more benadryl and advised to seek emergency medical attention if symptoms returned and were worse. Around 7;30pm I called to check on him. He had taken another dose of benadryl 50mg.  He still felt comfortable not seeking er attention since he was going to be with friends the rest of the evening and night.

                                                Thursday 4/8: 3:20pm: COVID injection given in right arm  Friday 4/9: ~1:00 am: woke up shaking with chills and severely cold; had slight headache. Had insomnia all night.   6:00 am: woke up with bad headache, slight fever.   7:00 am: got out of bed and had vertigo and was running into walls trying to walk to my living room, along with the worst migraine I?ve ever had. Also had dizziness, nausea,  chills, 100&#43;degree fever, aches, skin sensitive to touch, and severe tinnitus. All of the veins were visibly popping out of my head.   As the day went on, everything got worse. Any time I moved, my head would throb so bad that I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital.   3:45 pm:  the headache started to finally go away. It would only hurt if I moved fast. At this point my fever was only slightly high, about 99 degrees. I was still unstable when I walked and dizzy. I went from being super cold, to being super hot and sweaty. And I was alternating between cold &amp; hot and sweaty for the rest of the night. Was also having some memory issues, repeating things when I was having a conversation with someone over the phone.   I was sweating all night when I was sleeping.   Saturday 4/10: 7:00am: woke up with a slight headache; still out of it and dizzy.   8:00am: after being awake for about an hour or so, I looked in the mirror and my whole face (around the lips, cheeks, and jawline, and under the eyes) was really swollen and puffy. My face was even mis-colored. Under my eyes was purple and yellow, and my cheeks were white.   Some confusion persisted throughout the day as well as dizziness.

The chills and muscle pain were extremely intense 6 hours after I received my vaccine. I could not stop shivering, or get warm enough. That would be followed by a feeling that I was too warm and I would begin sweating profusely. I also experienced a few additional side effects I could not find listed:   I felt especially sensitive to stimuli as if normal sensations were heightened (e.g. hot water in a shower felt painful, running fingers through my hair felt like I was having my hair pulled, I kept my eyes squinted because the sunlight through the windows felt too bright.)  I was extremely irritable and became extremely frustrated easily. I mean frustrated to an embarrassing degree over small things that didn&#39;t matter. It was inconsistent with my day-to-day temperament. It felt like an adrenaline rush came in response to the most minor of inconveniences.

Pt. came to profusely sweating, pale, and feeling dizzy.  We took his BP and kept monitoring it for 45 minutes after we had him lay down.  His BP continued to rise and was normal.  Pt. was nervous before vaccine administration (shaking).  After event, Pt. stated this has happened in the past with donating blood.  Pt.&#39;s girlfriend picked him up, so he did not drive home.

I immediately grabbed another chair and raised his feet above his heart level. He immediately stated that he was &#34;feeling better&#34; and his vision was improving. I then offered him a cold bottle of water. He appeared very stable within a few minutes. We did call 911 as a precaution, they arrived a while later and deemed the patient was stable and their additional services were declined by the patient. I insisted the patient stay and finish the bottle of water. All together I believe the event was about 30 - 35 minutes before leaving. I encouraged the patient to drink plenty of fluids and electrolytes and to take it easy for the rest of the day.

About 5 hours after that I got chills that made me shake all over because I got a fever of 103. Then 2 hours later my heart started to beat very rapidly and got up to 126 beats per minute, my heart was also not only beating vast but very very hard. Then throughout the night and all of the next day, I had pain in my chest on the left side and also pain in my rib area on the left side. The pain lasted for over 24 hours and because of that I went to the emergency room. It turned out they didn&#39;t find anything life threatening at the emergency room but all the pain I had was very scary and very uncomfortable. It was a terrible experience and because of it, I am telling people not to get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.

I also noticed short-term memory loss and mood changes from feeling of Happy and sad and angry from around 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.  and the feeling of complete uselessness and regretting getting the vaccine to the point I wanted to cry saying oh I made a mistake. Almost as if my body was trying to tell me this was a mistake.  Throughout the evening the all over muscle soreness and headache and fever seem to be getting worse I even woke up in the middle of night between 2:00 and 3:00 a.m. and took Tylenol PM to help go back to bed.   Started feeling better later in the afternoon on April 2nd. Almost if everything went away and back to normal.   I have noticed that I have been having more head pain (I normally have none) than normal since receiving the vaccine.

Symptoms then began to slowly subside until by around 4p.m. the next day I felt mostly normal.

                                                In the span of about 40 minutes following the shot, I had severe reactions. I initially felt really warm in my arm and my heart started to race for a bit. That subsided pretty quickly. Then I got really dizzy, lightheaded and warm and sweaty while waiting the 15 minutes. Then my vision started to blur and I felt tingly in both of my hands and both of my legs. According to others with me, I also went grey. I was given a cool cloth and fanned which helped with a lot of the issues. I also had my legs elevated and was given some slightly sugary food and drink to help the vaccine disperse better. Paramadics and amabulance arrived to assess me. I was improving by the time they arrived and was deemed stable, so I did not go to the hospital for this incident

Was awake  immediately but said he didn&#39;t remember passing out. Knew his name, date of birth, where he was. I watched him until paramedics arrived. He said he felt fine but was sweaty.  Paramedics  stated all his vitals were normal and he said he felt ok but he said he got really hot.  Remained at the pharmacy until his friend could come and get him.
