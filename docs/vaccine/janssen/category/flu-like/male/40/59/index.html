I felt like I was stable, but felt dizziness increasing, and was lethargic through the weekend.   Then on Monday the 15th, I had a noticeable cramp in my right abdomen. At around 8pm CST I began feeling like I needed to burp and that I had GI problems.   The problems increased that night at around 10pm I had pain where the cramp started. Two hours later I started throwing up because of the pain and feeling of too much air inside of me. I could not stop vomiting after 2 hours so went to the Hospital ED at around 2:30 AM Tuesday the 16th.   I was admitted after a CT scan showed and white cell counts confirmed and infection and drastically enlarged appendix. I was diagnosed with an appendicitis and they immediately scheduled me for surgery.

Very severe just after injection. 3 days post vaccine and still feeling dizziness and headache with mild fatigue. Symptoms are similar to a hang over. The symptoms are slightly better than the day of vaccination but still exsist. Symptoms do seem to come and go and are not constant. Little relief is given by tylenol.

On-site nurses noticed I started to look pale and clammy and took me into evaluation room and checked my vitals. My vitals came back with low blood pressure and low oxygen levels. After resting and a cup of water, my vitals became all normal.

My body felt incredibly hot but I did sweat at all. If I would move the bed covers and any part of my skin below my neck felt the air I would get chills the would shake my entire body for a few seconds.  Later that morning; body aches all over, a fever reaching 101.3, fatigue. Over the counter medicines, napping, and a shower helped reduce symptoms.  All was gone by the next morning.

                                                Experienced moderate debilitating flu symptoms day after vaccination and recovered the following day.  Over one week later (3/25) developed skin sensitivity on the neck which later spread to back, torso, and legs.  Skin sensitivity persists still one week after onset, is a severe chafing feeling when skin comes into contact with clothing.  No rash or any visual signs.  Along with the skin sensitivity, mild to moderate chills from day to day as well as muscle fatigue and upper/lower back pain.  Symptoms varied in severity day to day; used ibuprofen and it seemed to offer limited, temporary relief.  Concurrent with second onset of symptoms, noticed gradual abdominal inflammation and developed sensation similar to UTI but urine dip and lab test results were all normal.  Doctor concluded immune reaction to vaccine as no other allergies or changes in routine as well as no prior medical history of any of these symptoms. Prescribed daily prednisone for three days to calm immune response; after one day symptoms were greatly improved.  Abdominal inflammation has improved and UTI sensation improved.  Still experiencing slight chills and skin sensitivity unchanged.

I couldn&#39;t sleep well because I got the chills and a fever. I went to use the bathroom around 3am. All of a sudden I got really nauseous, the room spun, everything went black and I fainted in the middle of my bathroom. My wife woke up and helped me back to bed. The next day I was very weak and tired. The chills and fever faded the next afternoon.

                                                Approximately seven minutes after the patient received the Janssen COVID vaccine, he had called out to his wife/pharmacy technician at the pharmacy stating he did not feel well.  His head had fallen back and his eyes were starting to roll back into his head. Patient had saliva starting to foam at the corner of his mouth and it appeared to be the onset of a mild seizure (per wife, patient has had seizure once before after a head injury) and he was turning very pale. Patient seemed to be unresponsive at that time - not answering to questions. At this point, one of the pharmacists ran to the clinic to get help and the other pharmacist administered an Epi-pen to patient&#39;s thigh.  Patient immediately came around after the injection, looked up and began talking. Staff called 911 and patient was monitored by pharmacy and clinic staff.  When the paramedics arrived, the patient was doing better and was able to ride home with his wife.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after the patient received his vaccination, he rested his head on the wall behind him in the chair he was being observed in and passed out and turned white. His wife began slapping his face and screaming his name and the observer called for me. I arrived within seconds and assisted his wife in moving him from the floor to the chair. Within seconds of getting his head to the ground safely, he came back to and was very sweaty, red in the face. He stayed on the ground laying down, and then sitting for approximately 25 minutes. During that time, he told us that he had previously passed out during 3 procedures done at doctors offices.  We got him an ice pack and a orange pop as he was complaining of being hot and having only eaten a granola bar all day. He was able to get up to a chair and sat there for an additional 5 minutes, before he was able to walk out on his own accord. I have spoken with the patient twice since, once last evening and once today and he reports he feels great now besides the expected body aches from the vaccination.

These symptoms I anticipated.   What I didn?t anticipate was my abdominal pain.  I still feel as of today (4/14), pain in my abdomen.  The areas of the discomfort are all over my mid-section.  I was so worried that I went to ?Urgency Care? doctor on 4/5/2021 and the nurse had me go for a ?CT Scan?.  I also went to my Primary care physician on 4/13/2021 and described my concern and abdominal pain but didn?t get a diagnosis.

                                                I had the worst headache of my life on 3/22 but assumed it was a migraine and treated it as such.  On 3/23 while playing hockey, nearly immediately after starting, the headache returned even stronger than on 3/22 and forced me to stop playing as I could not concentrate or focus.  The headache lasted for several days.  The following morning I went to my standard physician who immediately sent me to the ER because he was concerned about a potential aneurysm.  No cause was ever determined as the tests were inconclusive but it was suspected to potentially be a pinched nerve.  However, I never had any pain in my neck or elsewhere besides the headache.

He had headache &#34;almost migraine like&#34; and nausea started 03/30/2021 lasted about 24 hrs.  He states that he was just calling to report HA since he has heard the news about the Janssen vaccine.    I informed him that I would take down this information and that most likely he was having side effects to vaccine which is pretty common for those symptoms.  I also informed him of the adverse effects that would require immediate medical attention (severe HA, abd pain, leg pain and SOB).  He states that currently he feels fine and does not have any symptoms.  I informed him that would document this information for him and if he started with any other symptoms to come into clinic.

Sonner I felt a slight headache and from time to time it intensified to become unsupportable. At that time though about a lack of oxygenation, because I wore mask for the whole time I was working. About 9:am when I drove to home, I saw everything foggy in front of me.  When I get home I took  some paracetamol and another painkiller, because at that time my entire body was so warm, and the headache was very bad. I slept for 5 hours, when I woke up I went to the mechanic to fix my car.  While I got back during the time I saw the same foggy vision.

                                                Unusual exhaustion within an hour of the vaccine.  Had to go to bed and slept into the evening developing a fever of 103, severe thirst and chills. The fever lasted until 10:00 a.m. the following day, but weakness, thirst, chills and body aches continued for 3 more days intermittently. I would feel like I could finally exercise and then be too weak and tired to go back to routine. My appetite declined for 4 to 5 days as food didn&#39;t taste appealing. On Thursday, April 8, I announced to my mom in the morning that I finally felt like I was back at almost 100% and later in the afternoon felt nauseous, incredible pain in my chest and had dry heaves. I finally vomited some and was once again overcome by a fever of 101 and all I could do was sleep from severe exhaustion. I am against medication, but finally agreed to taking ibuprofen and tums. After sleeping into the next day around noon, I finally was able to eat some breakfast but the pain in my chest continued and I could rid it for another day. I intermittently had to sleep and gave up my exercise routine until my body has had time to recuperate. I have not fully recovered, but my appetite is picking up. I still require more sleep than normal.

I tried taking cold and flu medicine before bed so that I could sleep. I developed a cough and I damaged my ribs as a result of the coughing. My ribs on the right side hurt when I cough. I was prescribed a cough suppressant Benzonatate 100. I also got a steroid and the cough has gotten better after six weeks. It is still present but seems to be happening less often.

                                                Got injected, didn?t hurt much. Was told to wait 15 minutes in case of reaction. They walked away and left me sitting in a chair in a public space with everyone else who was waiting. I texted my wife to check in, when I started tearing up and crying for no real reason, then started feeling nauseous so I closed my eyes.   Suddenly I felt like I had been given a shot of adrenaline out of nowhere so I?m just trying to figure out if it?s nerves or a physiological response to something. I?m trying to control my breathing but having a hard time breathing.   Then the fever hit. The most intense flash of heat. I was hyperventilating. I couldn?t open my eyes or move or make a sound, I could just sit there struggling to breathe. My phone was in my hand and I couldn?t lift it. I just simply didn?t have the strength or energy to move.   At some point I legit thought I was about to die. I managed to angle my wrist so I could check my heart rate with my watch. It was 47bpm.   I was fading away but I made myself get control of my breathing and forced myself to take long deep slow breaths. It hurt, and I felt like passing out, but I kept doing it.   Fever turned into chills and then I soaked through my jeans and T-shirt in under a minute. I was finally thinking clearly and breathing and getting oxygen. Everyone else near me was fine.   Nobody checked on me the entire time including the 3 people who sat there and watched me suffer through this.  I told the pharmacist about my reaction and asked if it was normal and didn?t receive any indication that I should be concerned, so I went home since I felt better.   It wasn?t until my friend pointed out that this sounds like anaphylaxis that I thought I should report it. So here I am. Hopefully I?ll be okay.

My temp read 99.1. Normal is 97.4-97.7. Took Tylenol and went to bed.  Woke up  a few hours later sweating profusely.  Took temp again, was  101.6.  Was very unpleasant.  Fever broke a few hours later, though it went up and down throughout the next day, but not nearly as high. This was easily the sickest I&#39;ve been in 10-15 years.

At about 10:30pm I started feeling sick, fever of 99.6, muscle and joint pain, chills, dizziness, weakness. Left arm where I got injected also felt like it was falling asleep at some point when it shouldn&#39;t have been based on how I was positioned. I finally took an ibuprofen so I could sleep around 2:30am, and felt better a couple hours later or so. Today so far I feel fine but my resting heart rate is about 30 beats higher than normal so I&#39;m still responding to vaccine.  I think overall my symptoms aren&#39;t out of the ordinary, just way stronger than I was expecting. I felt miserable.

Then I continued sweating for a minute and then it faded away. After a couple minutes I felt fine again. I sat for another several minutes then left at 1:15 feeling ok with just a sore shoulder.

He turned pale and fell sideways off chair onto floor lowering himself with his knee. He did not bump his head, he was sweating profusely, but did not lose consciousness. I yelled to the tech to call 911. Patient was sitting on floor.  He said he did not eat much all day. He was alert and talking. He said he fainted when his wife had their baby. We gave his some orange juice. The paramedics arrived 8 minutes later and checked his vitals. In the meantime we called his wife. Paramedics checked his BP, glucose and questioned patient. Patient refuse to go with paramedics. Wife came and paramedics released him to her.

About five minutes in, another patient who received the vaccine together with patient told us the patient had fainted. Patient was slumped over to the side when I came to check on patient. I called the patient a few times and patient started to come to. I asked the patient how he was feeling and if he had any difficulty breathing to assess for anaphylactic shock. Patient was breathing normal, but was sweating and a bit confused. Patient reported feeling dizzy. I explained to patient that he fainted for a few minutes and instructed to sit as I did not feel comfortable having patient lay down in the state he was in. Patient was given water and a fan to help cool him down and legs elevated (patient reported feeling much better with the fan blowing on him). Patient sat at the pharmacy for over 30 minutes before heading to the bathroom. At this point, patient were no longer dizzy and I instructed him to get up slowly and assessed that patient was no longer dizzy before letting him go to the bathroom.

I woke up again in a few hours with worse chills, minor headache, and minor joint pain. I took over the counter medication, felt a little better and went back to sleep after a few hours. I woke up around 4am to use the bathroom and still had the worse chills, sweats, minor headache and was very dizzy. I decided to lay down on a rug rather than try to make it back to my bed and laid awake for a few hours again I woke up again in a few hours a little better and repeated everything until Sunday night when all my symptoms were very mild. I eat and drank water regularly and took over the counter acetaminophen a few times.

The fatigue is over whelming to the point it almost caused me to crash my vehicle on the way to work twice.  It has caused me to miss work because the tiredness is overwhelming.  It just doesn&#39;t seem to stop.

Monday morning at approximately 0230 i woke up to what i can only describe as lightning pains in my legs.  It was a very intense pain shooting from my upper thighs to my knees and slightly bending around to the top of my calves on the outside of the leg.  Monday all day i did not feel well.  Had a dull pain in center of chest, and my left arm from the shoulder blade to the elbow had what i can only describe as a slight warm sensation.  I was also very &#34;foggy&#34; and light headed.  On Tuesday the pain in my chest worsened.  My left arm kept going numb (and still does today 04.21.2021), my jaw hurt, i was light headed and again very foggy.  On Wednesday it was the same thing and I called the VA and they told me to come to the ER for evaluation.

After conferring with my primary care facility, it was recommended that I see an ophthalmologist. Confirmed that I had a Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) and recommended I meet with a retinal specialist.  Dr. confirmed the BRVO was caused by a blood clot and commenced treatment via eye injection.  I then met with my primary physician to discuss the situation.  He recommend further tests to determine whether I had other clotting.  In addition to blood work, he order MRIs of my brain, head and neck region and also recommended that I meet with a thrombosis specialist.  I met with a Dr. who ordered additional blood work for additional testing.  All tests performed to determine if I had additional clotting have come back negative.

I have been checking in with that website (V-safe App)  you gave me no one has contacted me. Monday (5/3/21) I missed work due to me not feeling good and still today (5/5/21) I&#39;m at work but feel like I could fall asleep, no energy, nausea still, and like I haven&#39;t slept in weeks even though I get good sleep. My breathing has gotten to the point that it hurts to take a deep breath. I believe this is all due to the shot but didn&#39;t know what you thought.&#34;

                                                I received the COVID Vaccine at 12:30 PM. My temperature had been increasing all afternoon along with my heart rate. At roughly 8:40 PM, my temperature increased dramatically to approximately 38.9C. This may have happened over a relatively short period of time, since it was 37.9 C at approximately 8:00 PM. My heart rate increased to 150 bpm and I became dizzy. After a minute, my heart rate decreased to roughly 115 bpm.  Unsure whether to call EMS or not, I called a friend, who is a Dr. at the local hospital (Dr. is a colleague we do research together.) Dr. was concerned but provided information on what to do and when to call EMS or be driven to the ER. I spent the rest of the evening with a pulse between 105 and 110 and my temperature hovered around 38.9C until at least 12:30 AM.   The next day, my heart rate had decreased to roughly 80 bpm and my temperature to approximately 37.8C. I spent most of Tuesday sleeping. Today (Wednesday May 12, 2021) my heart rate is down to roughly 76bpm. My temperature is holding around 37.2C.   I have reported this to the CDC through the COVID vaccine reporting app.   My resting pulse is usually 62 bpm with a waking pulse of 58-60. My normal temperature is 36.5-36.7C. I have a wellness exam schedule for Monday. Dr. is not my regular GP, but was available at a time when my regular doctor was not available.

By day 13 I started to get intermittent headaches that are very sharp. I am still getting them after three weeks. I have tried muscle relaxants and anti-anxiety medicine but they did not help. At night I am able to sleep but, in the morning, when I get up, I get sharp pains that are like ice picks and last for 3-5 seconds. Some of the headaches are more electric and as the day goes on it gets worse. I have tried taking Magnesium and Vitamin B-Complex and the headaches have changed to where they are starting in the afternoon instead of the morning. The headaches are a seven on a scale of 1-10. Sometimes the headaches come with a low grade fever.

The last time I experienced symptoms like this was on the first day I started chemotherapy and had an allergic reaction to one of the chemo drugs (bleomycin). I had a delayed reaction hours later and went to the ER. It was determined it was an allergy. So I took Claritin D 24 H and saw the symptoms I was experiencing last night dissipate.

He came up shortly after (less than 5 mins post imz) saying he didn&#39;t feel well, like he was going to pass out. I immediately came from the pharmacy, my tech sat a chair behind him. I called for optical to call a code white. The patient requested to sit on the ground. At this point, his wife was present. He was sweating. I gave him an ice pack, a water after it was determined he was breathing okay. He was pale, extremely lethargic and sweating. After sitting him on floor I told my tech to call 911. I took his blood pressure, it was 99/73, pulse 75. Very low for him. Hes on blood pressure medicine but been having issues controlling it. He later tells me hes terrified of needles. He also tells his wife he hadn&#39;t eaten all day. I stayed with the patient until ems left with him because when standing his heart rate dropped 20 points, after they stuck him again to check his blood sugar. They determined then he should be checked out at the hospital and they took him.

By 9 pm I was alternating between hot and cold sweats.  By 10 pm I was vomiting and defeating uncontrollably while still alternating between hot and cold sweats. I dry heaved until around 3 am and then finally passed out. My fever never exceeded right about 100 degrees. For the next 2 days I was incredibly exhausted with muscle aches and a minor headache. I didn?t return to baseline for approximately 6 days after the shot.

These subsided, and I developed a cough for the next 3 or 4 days. This developed into more of a chesty feeling and lethargic feeling. On the 8th day after my vaccine, my symptoms were similar to those in Covid positive cases; chest tightness, dry cough, and chills. I went to get tested, and was found to be Covid-19 positive. Since then, I have experienced severe headaches, continued tight chest, cough, chills, and sweats.

This happened both the first and second night.  During the day I was taking Tylenol every 6 hours for aches and pain.  Mainly my neck and back have been what hurts, although my knees, elbows, hips, etc. also were achy.  The third and fourth days I still continued to have chills, no fever throughout as far as I am aware (took my temp 2-3 times).  The fourth day I was very faint and somewhat unbalanced, felt shaky and light headed and I ended up having an anxiety attack.  I mention the last symptom as I have never had an episode like this previously in my life.  Today is day 5, still feel tired, slightly nauseous, neck and back pain, headache, difficulty focusing.

Vaccinator was notified that he has a history of vasovagal response with needles. This response presents itself as sweating (and possible fainting) and is alleviated by lying down. Client mentioned that previous nurse advised him to smell an alcohol pad to distract and prevent a vasovagal response, as this had worked previously on a glucose check. No medications were disclosed or history of anaphylaxis reported. With this background information, RN offered to have vaccine administered in reclined position, however client refused. RN conferred with co-lead about administration recommendations. Vaccinator then checked in with patient at 1423 to see if patient was okay and patient did not answer the question. RN then felt the client&#39;s hand and noticed hand was clammy. At 1425 the reclining chair was brought to the station and patient was transferred into chair, appearing diaphoretic. RN palpated pulse and noted patient was not tachycardia, but RN did note tachypnea and uneasiness. RN then provided distraction and promoted relaxation. Then at 1426 patient reported feeling okay and RN noted patient no longer felt clammy. At 1440 patient was asked if he would prefer if EMS should be called, patient declined and stated that he was able to drive home. Then at 1447 patient left the site appearing well, alert and oriented x3 leaving by self in private car.

Shortly after these symptoms I begin to have uncontrollable chills followed by a fever and Nausea. The whole time starting around 8pm I had pretty bad muscle aches as well. I took a warm shower and bundled up the whole night because I had a fever, aches, chills, and nausea. It was impossible to sleep because of this and sometimes my heart was beating fast as well. The next morning I had a headache that would not go away until I took Tylenol. The whole next day I felt exhausted as well and very weak. I began to feel better on day 3 but still feel somewhat foggy from the shot. I would not recommend this vaccine to anyone and would never get it again and hopefully the foggy sensation goes away.

Nothing major that kept me from working or sleeping. Some time after, maybe 3rd or 4th day, I noticed a shortness of breath. This I did not expect since it&#39;s not a listed side effect for the vaccine but it is one for Covid. I notice it everyday while sitting/working. It does not keep me from being active (running/yard work) but I notice I&#39;m not 100% healthy feeling. It feels like  the shortness of breath is closer to the top of the chest/throat area if that makes any sense. If I breathe deeply it feels like I may want to cough although I don&#39;t usually cough from doing so. It&#39;s mostly just a constant feeling of a very slight shortness of breath.

                                                On 4/10 I started feeling tired with muscle aches.  A few days later my skin started to hurt.  Clothing was uncomfortable when it moved across my skin. Those symptoms lasted about a week. Then as they started to lessen I had some back pain (Sciatic) and a sore throat.  Also the muscles behind my eyes were slightly painful and bright lights were uncomfortable.  Then about  4/21 most of the symptoms reduced and I was feeling close to normal.  Then on 4/22 I was brushing my teeth and noticed that I couldn?t spit water like normal.  I called my GP doc and she recommended I head to the ER.   After thinking about it I also remember on 4/21 while drinking something I had some water squirt out of my lips.  At the time I thought I was just being clumsy but in hindsight the muscle weakness in my face started on 4/20.   I checked into the ER on 4/22.  When I checked into the hospital my facial weakness was very difficult to notice.  By the evening of 4/22 it was noticeable if I tried to ?show my teeth? or make a big smile. By the morning of 4/23 it was very noticeable.  The morning of 4/24 I couldn?t move my lips, nose or eyebrows.  My tongue, jaw and throat were not impacted at all.   I was started on plasmapheresis on  4/24. I had another treatment on 4/25. I noticed facial weakness was very slightly recovering the evening of 4/25.  By 4/27 my facial weakness is still healing with noticeable improvement day to day.

                                                Had a sudden onset fever which reached 103 the evening of the injection.  There was muscle soreness, fatigue, my pulse was above 80 all night and reached 100 during the peak of the fever.  By the next morning, the fever had dropped to 100, fatigue remained and a slight headache appeared.  The headache was gone by noon, the fatigue remained all day.  The evening after the injection, a slight fever returned and then stopped.  Two days after the injection, there were no further averse reactions other than slight soreness in the injection site.  I am no longer fatigued and feel fine.  Hope this information helps.

When I try to feel for something poking the top of my head, there is nothing there and touching the area does not cause pain. But then I may look to the right and frown, and suddenly there is a sharp needle feeling in the top of my head.

Three days later around 6:25 am on April 15, 2020: I got out of bed, next moment I recall is of me on the floor. No memory of falling. I was shaking uncontrollably as if my body was getting many commands at the same time but I had no control over it. I could not call out for help. At one point I was biting my right  hand but could not make myself stop until my shaking stopped. Bite did not penetrate skin but I had visible bite mark on my hand.  I regained control suddenly and just got up slowly and shaken by the experience. Wife then drove me to the ER.  Been feeling pressure on my head.

                                                I received the shot on 4/10. First 24 hours I had a slight fever and headache. Treated with Acetaninophhen. Since that time, I had relatively mild symptoms 4/11 - 4/13. Mostly fatigue.  On 4/14, I had a sudden increase in heart rate, dizziness, tingling sensation in all arms and legs and weakness in my limbs/grip. This prompted me to visit the ER. They ran numerous blood tests amd scans on me but found no abnormalities. Various unusual symptoms have continued to persist since 4/14.  For brief moments I feel fine.  At other times I have experience fatigue, diziness/vertigo, rapid heart rate, pins and needles feeling in my left hand and left leg.  Left leg numbness/tightness and heaviness. The fingers on my left hand sometimes move involuntarily.  And my anxiety has also gone up during this time. Tonight it has migratee to my left foot, where I have numbness in several of my toes.  I&#39;m looking for advice. Should I be concerned? Should these symptoms still be occurring 11 days after receiving my shot?  It has been very distressing and there seem to be very few people who have knowledge on this subject.  My care providers keep saying to self monitor and contact them if symptoms worsen. The problem is symptoms don&#39;t necessarily worsen, they just migrate from one area of my body to another.  The numbness comes and goes in maybe 1-2 hour intervals.

At approximately 4:46pm I developed a strong pain at the injection site.  At approximately 8pm I began to run a  fever and feel extremely fatigued.  My back and all my joints started to ache, I was sweating but also freezing cold.  I had a dull, throbbing pain in my testes.  I had pain in my scalp, my eyebrows, my ear lobes, my fingernails, my toes and toenails, the soles of my feet hurt.  Least of all I also had a headache.   I took 500mg Ibuprofen for the pain.    Now, almost 48 hours later I still have a low grade fever, still have considerable pain at the injection site, still have a headache.  The remaining symptoms dissipated on 5/2/21 at about 12pm.  Took another 500mg Ibuprofen for breakfast, but otherwise have had no appetite since receiving the vaccine.

I was unable to eat  until the breathing issues subsided late afternoon Sunday since I felt as though I was choking when I  attempted to eat. The fatigue and body pain was pronounced enough for me to have to call off work  Monday, but they gradually diminished.

                                                Patient was given shot and asked to wait in pharmacy area at least 15 minutes.  Within about 5-10 minutes his girlfriend comes to the pharmacy window and tells me he&#39;s feeling bad.  By the time I get to his chair he is very lethargic and slumped over.  I sit him up in the chair and his head rolls back and his eyes have rolled back in his head.   I place him on the floor and instructed my staff to call 911.   The patient presented with sweats and was unresponsive for about 10-20 seconds.   When he came to he asked how he got on the floor.   The patient never had any trouble breathing  heart rate was steady the entire time.   When EMS arrived they checked him out and was fine.  He refused transport to the hospital.  He walked out of the store after about 30 minutes from the point of his passing out.

At that point, started getting chills, which progressed into mix of chills and hot spells, fever, headache, and frequent urination throughout the night (though was also hydrating a lot).  Had fever the next morning still and Diarrhea.  Still feel modest headache and chills the next evening (before bed where I had felt the worst overnight the first night of the vaccine) but feeling better than the first night.  Per the form I received, I was told to include Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA in this section of the form.  I am reporting this on the day after the vaccination, so don&#39;t yet know final outcome, but again, improving and don&#39;t feel like I need medical attention.

                                                I felt fine all day and went to bed at 9:30pm. I woke up to my body shaking uncontrollably and I was freezing at 10:30pm. My wife felt my skin and she said I was burning up. Unfortunately our thermometer wasn&#39;t working so I don&#39;t know my temperature, but I have never in my life shaken so badly with a fever. I couldn&#39;t control myself and I was shaking so hard that my muscles were sore from it, but I still couldn&#39;t stop. I then began vomiting every 45 minutes or so. This happened for nearly 4 hours until 2:18am. Then very suddenly everything just stopped. No more feeling cold (actually I then felt very warm and couldn&#39;t cool off. I was sweating quite a bit). No more shaking. No more vomiting. I did get a wicked headache, but I figured it was due to dehydration and took two Advil. The Advil didn&#39;t do anything and I was awake until 5:59am because my head hurt too badly to sleep. Finally I slept for about 4.5 hours. Then I just felt worn out for most of the day on the 10th, and couldn&#39;t shake the headache. Then on the evening if the 10th, I started getting a sore throat and a slightly runny nose. I went to bed that way. When I woke up on the 11th (today) I still had the sore throat and slight runny nose. The headache was gone, but I felt tightness in my chest. As I went throughout the day, I&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;m short of breath with doing most things. I have two young children, so even taking care of them I feel like at times I&#39;m struggling for breath. I&#39;m not in bad shape and am a runner, so my cardio isn&#39;t bad. So I was surprised by this.

After going to bed around 9:30 PM and therefore lying down  I suddenly started to cough. It last for about 10 minutes, I could not stop. I also started to sweat. At this time I believed I got COVID-19 at the vaccination site and moved to another room to avoid to expose furthermore my wife. I did not cough anymore since then. Today after reading the news and symptoms of blood clot in the lung, I prefer to report this incident.

Then suddenly I felt a severe headache (as if my head was shot by a gun) at the center of my forehead. This is only the first time I felt that kind of headache. However, it only lasted for about 5-10 secs for that severe pain then after that i just felt dizzy for about 20 mins. Since then, I&#39;m fine now and hoping that I will not feel that same pain again.

After sleeping, woke up (about 24 hours after receiving the vaccine) feeling nausea and my head was aching.    After several hours of feeling nausea, I began to vomit.  I had only drank liquids since dinner the night before. Several days after the vaccine, I had a headache for 24 hours, with pain focused above my right eye.

Then about 5:30pm I got super uncomfortable and then my skin got hypersensitive.   To the point I couldn&#39;t even touch it.  Then I felt like I had a fever but when I checked I did not.  Went to bed at 8pm still with the hypersensitive skin.  Could not get comfortable to sleep but when i eventually fell asleep I slept for 10 hours.  Thats about 5 more than I normally do.  The next day the hypersensitive skin was gone just felt a little wore out.

                                                At injection muscle spasmed, nurse stated never seen that before.  Within 1-2 hours had runny nose and felt stuffed up, thought it could be allergies or something and didn?t really attribute to vaccine.  4-5 hours  after injection felt something across the top of my brain ... felt as though something had been stuck in a blood vessel and became unstuck allowing blood to shoot through.  Was certainly freaked out by this, but was at an event and head of the ER department of the local hospital was also attending - so figured I had quicker access to medical care there if needed, than at home.   30-60 minutes later congestion completely cleared up.  9-12 hours after vaccination had extreme chills.  Day after vaccination had pain below the injection site... injection was 2? above pain.  Also neck pain. Day 2-8 since vaccination, on/off muscle pain or injection site pain. Today, day 9, have muscle pain in wrist of injection arm.

                                                The first couple of days had a fever, light-headed, pulsating feeling through my body, and feeling faint at times.  Symptoms go away after the third day.  Then nearly two weeks later the feeling of being light-headed, pulsation sensation throughout my body, and feeling faint at times came back.  It&#39;s been a few days of these symptoms returning and it has me concerned.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: Unknown) frequency 1 total, dose was not reported, administered to left arm on 06-APR-2021 at 12 noon for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 6-APR-2021 at 12 noon, patient got vaccinated and was fine that day . Next morning on 07-APR-2021,  patient woke up with sever cramping in same shoulder which he got the shot in, most pain was in the upper left quarter of his torso to down half way to chest up to the shoulder till the neck . By the end of the day it  spread to his whole chest and upper body. Also he had shortness of breath ,could not breath .The cramping and shortness of breath came at same time. He took Advil and went along with his day . He took 3 tablet of Advil 200mg  every 4-5 hours all day ( total of 3 dose that day) . By night time the case was progressively worse as the whole chest had a lot of pain . He thought that he had heart attack . He thought that he was about to  pass out . He could not stand on his own . So his wife took him to emergency room at mid night at 12:30 am on 08-APR-2021. He stayed there for 5 hours and they did  bunch of tests , EKG which rolled out the heart attack .They did  Chest X-ray which found things then did D-dimer which its level was very high . They found  bunch of clots in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides. They did ultra sound on the legs  which had no evidence of blood clots . They discharged him  from the emergency room as  they felt that he was ok to be out . After couple of hours after discharge , patient&#39;s health care professional wrote for him Eliquis, antibiotic and pain reliver. He was given antibiotic because he had  beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed) . It was found air sacs in lung with signs of pneumonia in both lobes . He came home and started to  monitor his blood oxygen . He stayed in the  same position till recovery . He was better each day since last week but still had sinus and cramping in the chest ( very minor but was still there). The lung capacity was very limited to take some steps. Patient stated that he needed a specialist to understand his condition. He had no medical history before that incidence . He was wondering regarding which type of blood thinner was good for this type of blood clots because he read that the regular blood thinners are not good for that type of blood clot which his HCP gave (regular blood thinner). Laboratory data included: Total lung capacity decreased (NR: not provided) lung capacity is very limited. On 08-APR-2021, Laboratory data included: Chest X-ray (NR: not provided) found things, EKG (NR: not provided) rolled out heart attack, Fibrin D dimer (NR: not provided) level was very high, and Ultrasound scan (NR: not provided) no evidence of blood clots.  Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included: apixaban, and ibuprofen. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of the severe cramping in left shoulder and upper body, chest pain (whole chest had lot of pain)/thought that he had heart attack, shortness of breath/could not breath, thought that he was about to pass out, difficulty in standing, bunch of clots in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides, beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed), cramping in chest and sinus was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments:  This 44-year-old male patient reported blood clots of both lungs 2 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  The patient denies any medical history/condition prior to vaccination.  The symptoms reported were severe cramping of arm that spread to his whole chest and upper body and shortness of breath; the patient thought he had a heart attack, about to pass out and could not stand because of the progression of pain.  EKG done at the emergency room ruled out heat attack, D-Dimer was reported to be very high, clots were found in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides, x-ray showed beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed).  The patient was prescribed with Eliquis, an unspecified antibiotic and pain reliever.  Outcome of the events were not reported.   Based on the information that is available, the event is assessed as plausible with the causal association to immunization, per WHO causality classification of adverse events following immunization based on a lack of a definitive plausible biological mechanism.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

Then, after the first week of having the vaccine, I began to have these symptoms about once a week. Last week, it was on 5/6 when I gradually become colder regardless of layers and my stomach was repelling the idea of food (no vomiting or actual nausea). I went to bed and I was better by morning.   Yesterday (5/12), I had the same thing. Chills and the inability to stay warm, loss of appetite, and a sort of sleepy vertigo.

Wife was hot while I was freezing and shivering uncontrollably, so I know something was wrong with me.  The shivering and chills lasted for a couple of hours until about 2:30-3:00am.  Then I got really hot.  Took my temperature, was at 99.1 degrees.  But room was really warm so I turned down the temperature and took off my layers of clothing.  Woke up this morning, around 7am, to a headache and aching legs.  I took 2 Excederin, but the headache is still there.  Legs are feeling better after a couple of hours.

I was awakened at 1:00 AM with severe muscle spasms in my left bicep and a fever of 102.5 I started taking tylenol to begin reducing the fever. I also lost my appetite around that time. Things were pretty much the same all day 3/14/21. I went to sleep at 10:00 PM I got up every four hours to take tylenol. I woke up at 7:00 AM 3/15/21 to prepare for work my bed sheets and shirt were soaked with sweat but my fever was gone. I ate breakfast and drank a cup of coffee. When I got to work I begin having stomach problems.  When I started working I noticed that I was having a lot of trouble concentrating. I decided to leave early to go home and rest. Things have improved since then but I do have a headache that won&#39;t go away.

They finally decided it was an allergic reaction. Gave a steroid shot and Benadryl. Sent home on steroids for 5 days. The next day had rash and itching. The next day it was worse looked like lace pattern rash over most of his body and really bad itching. Like this through the 20th then he took Claritin and put on anti -itch cream. The next  day the rash had mostly cleared but still a little itchy. Today the 22 I have had a really bad headache.

Randomly throughout the afternoon I had similar dry/itchy/tingling in my throat but not as strong as the time right after the vaccination. I didn&#39;t suspect this was directly related to the virus since I have allergies to grasses, trees, pollen, etc. and take over the counter allergy medicine as needed.  At 3:30am today (4/10/21) I woke up having to use the restroom and when standing up out of bed I was extremely dizzy. After laying down in bed the dizziness disappeared. When waking up later in the morning the dizziness/light headed feeling was still present when standing. I also have noticed random strange pinching pain in my legs that only last for 1-2 seconds and sends a quick short pain sensation throughout my body.    I have no clue if any of this is related to the vaccination received, but after noticing news articles with issues in a few folks receiving the Janssen vaccine, I decided I would pass this info along just in case.

After 40 minutes, the lightheadedness, faintish and dizziness subsided.  However, the intense heat, sweating and nausea continued.  By the evening an intense migraine started and by 4/10/21 my sister vomited and started running a fever 100.5.  Complete muscle aches, overall feeling extremely ill, totally bed ridden and a migraine that cannot be controlled at all.

                                                5 minutes after receiving the injection, my husband passed out, starting sweating profusely, and was out cold for a minute. EMS were called and he was seen in ER due to low heart rate and sweating to rule out any heart conditions. He had 2 EKGs - one in the ambulance and one in the ER. He also had to have a CT for falling and bumping his head to rule out that injury. The DX was listed as a vagal response, but we are not so sure we agree given that he is 45 years old, has no priory history or anxiety about shots.

I wasn&#39;t sure if I had a fever, but I did not feel well.  My wife was trying to warm me up and she thought I was having a seizure because she had never felt someone shiver so violently.  My eyes were watering abnormally as well.  The shivering subsided after about 30 minutes.  I was soar and weak over the couple of days, but I believe those are normal symptoms.

                                                I had mild pain radiating in my arm within 2 minutes of the vaccine.  1-2 hours later I developed unusual and intermittent pain on the volar surface of my wrist.  8 hours after the vaccine I developed chills, severe fatigue, myalgias, loss of appetite, and a fever up to 101.  I was bedridden for 36 hours and then the symptoms gradually subsided by day 3.  I then developed a sense of chest tightness intermittently for the next 4 days usually at night.  I did not have chest pain, but had tachypnea at times with a respiratory rate up to 22/min. At day 7 this resolved.

                                                after receiving vaccine, about 12 hours later i had the standard side effect of moderate fever (approx 102), chills, and was very fatigued.  The fever was gone the next day, but i took the next day off and stayed in bed.  The concerning problem was i developed tingling and numbness throughout most of my body, especially on the side where i had the shot, in my arm, neck mouth and tongue.   After about 36 hours after the shot i started to feel about 80% better, but the tingling/numbness continued and i continued to have major fatigue.  From day 3-5, i was having some trouble moving around - almost like my legs weren&#39;t wanting to respond to my brain.   Since these symptoms lasted until about day 5, i got concerned and called the doctor.   However, right before talking with the doctor in day 5 i was able to do some yoga and was feeling much better, and it all seemed to resolve.  I feel better now.

                                                On March 13, I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine at the  clinic  The pharmacist monitored me for symptoms but there were none right away. I did have a fever and some body aches in the two or three days that followed but those were short-lived.  While driving on March 16, I started experiencing some irregular breathing and periods of shortness of breath about three hours after leaving home. I stopped at the emergency room at the Health Center where Dr diagnosed me with an acute pulmonary embolism after discovering a small blood clot in one of my lungs. He prescribed me with Eliquis, which I am still taking today. Their phone number is provided if you have questions.  I haven&#39;t had too many shortness of breath episodes lately but do not know if the blood clot is still there. I am scheduled to see my hematologist on April 27 to get further updates on this. My hematologist Dr is located in clinic number provided While it has not yet been proven that the vaccine caused the blood clot in my lung, I feel the need to report this in the wake of recent news about the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. My hematologist and primary care physician are both aware that I have received the vaccine but I have not received any further communication from them.

Patient found to have a Hunt Hess 3 Fisher Grade 3 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage with hydrocephalus s/p EVD,  s/p cerebral angiogram on 4/18 negative for aneurysm/AVM. On the evening of 4/20, patient became acutely hypoxic with wheezing for which he required oxygen via 10L oxymask. During 4/21, his oxygen requirements continued to increase with increased work of breathing requiring high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) at 50L/60%  &#43; pulmonary congestion on imaging and he was treated with diuresis. On 4/22, oxygen needs increased requiring 70L/100% with worsening imaging. He was then started on steroids, antibiotics were broadened, epoprostenal started in addition to diuresis. On 4/23, patient reports improved breathing and is on non-rebreather. Antibiotics, steroids, and epoprostenal were discontinued as patient showed improvement of oxygenation without clear signs of infection. Of note,  patient reports vaping in the past 2-3 months.  Patient has also been intermittently febrile. Wife was concerned that these symptoms were possibly related to him getting the J&amp;J vaccine on 4/11.

Approximately 10 minutes after the vaccine, he reported feeling very faint and was about to pass out. He wasn&#39;t feeling well so 911 was called. He also reported feeling hot and was visibly sweating. He drank some water and sat in front of a small fan until medics arrived. They assessed him and he walked out with them for further evaluation. I called patient at 7:30 to see how he was feeling. There was no answer and his voicemail didn&#39;t allow me to leave a message.

                                                Started in the middle of night- awoke to my arm I got injected in being completely numb. Moved my arm around, got circulation and feeling back went back to sleep.  Then the next day all day my back was sore and all my joints felt sore including my ankles, wrist, neck, knuckles, elbows, knees. Just soreness - NO FLU LIKE SYMPTOMS - but sorness all over. I left message with Doc&#39;s office. Next day my joints felt better but I awoke with splitting headache. Took aspire and all improved.

At 15 minutes asked nurse if normal. Then started sweating. left hand turned purple. Dont really remember anything else. Went unconscious. Remember them yelling Code something and Cardiac arrest. Taken to ER. Think they may have said anaphalatic shock. I think they gave me epinepherine. Had paralysis in left hand when i woke up for a few minutes. Blood work and EKG were normal. Went home within a couple of hours. Light-headed two days later still. Saw doctor two days after. Blood pressure is high.  Little bit of fatigue and brain fog.

My body was cold. I had a pretty severe headache as well.  My body ached all over. Muscle and joint pain. I took Tylenol, but it didn&#39;t seem to do much. I spent all day Saturday in bed or on the couch. I ran a fever of 100.9 to 101.6 all day Saturday. My body ached making it hard to go up or down stairs. I was weak feeling and I was exhausted just going to refrigerator to get juice or water. Not much of an appetite all day. Also, arm was sore and bruised at the shot location. That was the least of my issues. Today is Sunday and I am feeling better now. I feel like the worst is absolutely behind me, but I felt so terrible yesterday, I thought I should report my issues.

He remained in the IMZ room for observation and applied a cool compress to forehead and back of neck.  Coloring came back after about 10-15 minutes and he said he felt better.  Also mentioned that this happened to him after he got a TDap vaccine about 15 years ago - he said it is a mental thing with him and does not like to get vaccines.

                                                Seizure-like episode. Patient was seated when his body went rigid and he lost postural control and started to slide sideways. His body was shaking slightly and his eyes were open but there was no cognitive awareness. This lasted no more than 90 seconds and then patient came to abruptly and reoriented himself on the chair before I had the opportunity to get him to the floor. Patient then stated that he was lightheaded, warm and sweaty. EMT had been called and upon assessment of the patient transported him to the ER.

                                                3AM woke up with high fever, headache, muscle ache from shoulders up. Treated with Tylenol to reduce fever, symptoms continued through the day. 2PM discovered large patch of hives on back from right shoulder to waist approximately 4 inches wide at the top and narrowing to 1 inch wide at the bottom. Treated with my go-to allergic reaction kit: Xyzal, Benadryl, Prednisone, and Pepcid. Hives started fading after 1 hour and were mostly gone within 3 hours, followed by 12 hours of sleep.

This continued for about 3-3.5 weeks. On the night of Apr 16, he went to bed early not feeling well. Next morning he complained of heaviness in the chest area. We immediately consulted Dr., and mentioned that he got the vaccine. Dr. advised us to immediately go to an Emergency Room. Patient was found to be having a heart attack. His right artery was 100% blocked. The 3 left arteries had no blockage at all. Angioplasty was done and he had a stent placed in right artery. The clot was removed as part of angioplasty. He now needs to be on blood thinners for life.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I did not feel well within a minute or so of receiving the shot - not an allergic reaction per se. The nurses took my blood pressure and it was 200&#43;/100&#43; and HR was 108. They continued to monitor and it slowly went down over the course of the 45 minutes I was there. Upon departure, BP reading was at about 160/90. I monitored that evening and Sunday and was normal most of the time. I did have a similar feeling Sunday afternoon and Monday afternoon, and when I checked my BP it was about 150/90 and HR was elevated (between 100-115bpm). Eventually I felt better, excluding expected side effects I&#39;ve had - fever, aches, and fatigue. As of Tuesday (today as of writing), I am feeling better than yesterday, less fatigue and no fever thus far. I am hoping no more episodes with the elevated BP and HR occur today or in the near future. I did notify my physician about this and he asked me to monitor my BP for the next week, stay hydrated, and report back if no improvement in BP readings.

                                                Immediately after patient was given vaccine, the patient passed out for 1-2 minutes, then vomited, became light-headed, and broke out into sweats. After 2 minutes the patient regained consciousness, however, the other symptoms persisted for about 10 minutes.

My blood pressure was elevated as well. And that was not going away either. I went to doctor. My headaches have decreased. But for the last two to three days I have been getting chest pains. I have called the doctor this morning and I&#39;m waiting to call me back.  It&#39;s not ongoing pain - just every now and then - I&#39;m not sure what it is.

Then that day he started getting a headache, feverish, took Tylenol and felt better.  The next day he noticed his heart rate would not go down, it will not go down below 100, will shoot up to 130.  He went to the ER and at one point went to 150.  They prescribed him some medicine to lower his blood pressure and he has been taking that and it has not been helping.  He also went to his doctor and told him that it was probably anxiety, and his heart rate will still not go down.  He has not had any other reactions other than this and he&#39;s scared.

                                                Got vaccine at 12:30am, was home asleep by 2:30. Head was insanely stuffy when I woke up around 8:30, my ears hurt on the inside and I couldn?t hear well. My lungs felt kind of funny, as if I?d taken too much asthma medication. By noon my lungs were burning with every breath, my eyes were hot and weepy, the fever and muscle/joint aches had gotten really bad, and I had pain in my neck under my jaw between chin and ears.

Fever ultimately broke and temp was normal when I woke up this morning.  Just tired and head-achy now likely from poor nights sleep.  Temps were taken with an oral, digital read thermometer.  I will follow up if fever continues.

                                                Day 1: Saturday morning March 6 at 5:00am I was shaken out of my sleep with a nasty migraine, sour stomach, intense body aches, stuffy nose, fever (102f). Classic flu like symptoms. I was extremely sick all day Saturday (level of sick: 8/10). Day 2: Sunday morning March 7 I awoke again extremely sick, just as sick as Saturday. All same symptoms (level of sick: 7/10). Sunday night I was incredibly miserable, all flu symptoms, I did not sleep Sunday night, up all night and up all day the next day Monday. Day 3: Monday I continued to be sick, all same symptoms, all day long. This time the blood shot eyes &amp; bloody nose came on, fever was steady at 101f (level of sick: 6/10). Day 4: Tuesday woke up still stick, same flu like symptoms. I feel the headache has gotten worse, in fact way worse. Fever steady at 101f all day. Overall I&#39;m not as sick except the headache and fever (level of sick: 6/10).  Day 5: Wednesday I was really hoping I&#39;d make a full recovery but still still sick, fever dropped for a few hours then came back, fever peaks and bounces around at 101f. Headache is absolutely nasty, I feel intense pain in the back of my neck and head, hard to sleep or lay down. (level of sick: 5/10). Day 6: Thursday I feel like I&#39;m just about kick this sickness, feeling way better. I dont have a fever today but I still have an incredibly nasty headache, really intense, my eyes hurt, back of my neck hurts. (level of sick: 3/10). Day 7: Friday, no flu symptoms, finally!! But the headache continues, really bad. It sort of disables my ability to function with the headache. Back of my neck and back of head hurts, inside my brain hurts. Ugh! Day 8: Saturday, no flu, no fever, although still bad headache. I&#39;ve been taking Advil all week to help reduce the headache. It helps, but after about 6 hours later the headache returns. Late in the evening Saturday my head was pounding. Day 9: Sunday headache not that bad, mild headache lingered throughout the day, tolerable. Day 10: Monday no headache!! Today was the first full day of full happiness!! *NOTE*: In July 2020 I got COVID extremely bad, spent 4 days in the ICU, couldnt breathe!! I had a fever of 103 for 6 days straight before calling 911 to come and get me. I was in bad shape, lost 30 lbs, had respiratory breathing issue for about 2 months after hospital stay. Most sick I&#39;ve ever been, total game changer, I will never be the same. To this day I feel my respiratory is at 90%, fatigue still comes around every so often. --- Thank you ---

                                                Day 1: Saturday morning March 6 at 5:00am I was shaken out of my sleep with a nasty migraine, sour stomach, intense body aches, stuffy nose, fever (102f). Classic flu like symptoms. I was extremely sick all day Saturday (level of sick: 8/10). Day 2: Sunday morning March 7 I awoke again extremely sick, just as sick as Saturday. All same symptoms (level of sick: 7/10). Sunday night I was incredibly miserable, all flu symptoms, I did not sleep Sunday night, up all night and up all day the next day Monday. Day 3: Monday I continued to be sick, all same symptoms, all day long. This time the blood shot eyes &amp; bloody nose came on, fever was steady at 101f (level of sick: 6/10). Day 4: Tuesday woke up still stick, same flu like symptoms. I feel the headache has gotten worse, in fact way worse. Fever steady at 101f all day. Overall I&#39;m not as sick except the headache and fever (level of sick: 6/10).  Day 5: Wednesday I was really hoping I&#39;d make a full recovery but still still sick, fever dropped for a few hours then came back, fever peaks and bounces around at 101f. Headache is absolutely nasty, I feel intense pain in the back of my neck and head, hard to sleep or lay down. (level of sick: 5/10). Day 6: Thursday I feel like I&#39;m just about kick this sickness, feeling way better. I dont have a fever today but I still have an incredibly nasty headache, really intense, my eyes hurt, back of my neck hurts. (level of sick: 3/10). Day 7: Friday, no flu symptoms, finally!! But the headache continues, really bad. It sort of disables my ability to function with the headache. Back of my neck and back of head hurts, inside my brain hurts. Ugh! Day 8: Saturday, no flu, no fever, although still bad headache. I&#39;ve been taking Advil all week to help reduce the headache. It helps, but after about 6 hours later the headache returns. Late in the evening Saturday my head was pounding. Day 9: Sunday headache not that bad, mild headache lingered throughout the day, tolerable. Day 10: Monday no headache!! Today was the first full day of full happiness!! *NOTE*: In July 2020 I got COVID extremely bad, spent 4 days in the ICU, couldnt breathe!! I had a fever of 103 for 6 days straight before calling 911 to come and get me. I was in bad shape, lost 30 lbs, had respiratory breathing issue for about 2 months after hospital stay. Most sick I&#39;ve ever been, total game changer, I will never be the same. To this day I feel my respiratory is at 90%, fatigue still comes around every so often.

Woke up at about 1:30AM with mild nausea. Within about 30 minutes I experienced chills.  I hydrated and tried to go back to sleep.  In the morning I had a fever of 100.3 degrees.  Took 1000 mg of Tylenol and hydrated, another 500 mg 4 hours later. Chills came on and off throughout the day.   Added layers of clothing to stop the chills. Ate breakfast and lunch. Drank G2 to hydrate. Temp bounced between 99.6 and 100.8 throughout the day.  Experienced heartburn for several hours in the afternoon. Took a  nap at 3:30 for 2 hours, ate, rehydrated and removed some layers to clothing and put on a cool towel on my forehead to try to reduce.  Took 1000 mg of Tylenol and went to  bed. Slept well. All symptoms were gone by morning.

His headache was getting worse.  All symptoms were getting better except the headache.  He thought he was feeling better but when he woke up today 4/6/2021 he was SOB and diarrhea was back. Pt has taken Pepto Bismol for his symptoms and will probably need to go to the ER since he is having trouble breathing.   He feels like he has had such a bad reaction to this since he possibly has had the covid vax in the past 90 days.

                                                Shot at 1:50pm Saturday. Woke with headache at 2:45am Sunday. By 5:00am Sunday had bad stomach pain and fever of 100.9F. Headache varied, got worse, got better, got worse, etc. Bad stomach pain lasted straight through until about 1:00am Monday. It&#39;s now 8am Monday, a little bit of stomach pain but far less than what it was.

                                                When injected after about 60 seconds semi severe achy-burning feeling  in my arm that subsided in a few minutes. After 15 minutes slight tingling/numbness on the tip of my tongue and slight tingling in the upper lips of my mouth. I was not worried. I took 1 Benadryl and 2 Ibuprofen (400 ml) at that time for symptoms. I took additional 1 Benadryl and 4  Ibuprofen about 6 hours later as a precaution.  Day 2 after about 36 hours I had slight soreness, and some sweating as I slept the 2nd night. Treated with 4 ibuprofen. Also I woke up with a feeling of uneasiness in the middle of the night on the 2nd night.  Day three, just a general feeling of tiredness. Day 4 and 5 still slight ache in the injection sight if pressure is applied. Other than that I feel normal as of day 5.

About a week later, I started coughing a lot. My head hurt,but i didn&#39;t run any fever. I thought I was having bad allergies from changing weather, but it lasted longer than usual, over a week. I was sore, tired, not really hungry. I feel better now, but I still have this lingering dry cough and it won&#39;t completely go away. I still feel sore and very tired. I get a headache every now and then. I thought it was allergies, but it falls into the time period that people are having reactions to this JJ Janssen shot. The cough is annoying. I get short breathed and winded rather easily or more easily now. I thought I&#39;d at least report it.

It was constant discomfort and irritation.  It was not painful and therefore I originally did not go to medical.  There was no discomfort in my left arm at the injection site.  The discomfort increased for the rest of the day.  A headache started in mid afternoon and kept increasing throughout the rest of day.  I have not had a headache in years.  Around 7:00 PM on Thursday, I had to sleep.  I was extremely tired.  My body had chills and I had to wear a sweatshirt and full set of clothes to bed just to stay warm.  That is very unusual.  I am usually throwing off covers every night throughout the entire year.    I did not eat dinner because there was no appetite.  I slept in bed for at least 12 hours.  Typical night sleep = 8 hours.  The next morning was no issue and therefore I did not go seek medical help because there are supposed to be side effects to vaccines.  Now, I am reporting it because headache and the stiff muscles were identified on the news.  However, it was around 24-36 hours and not the 6 days on the news.

The following Monday, I woke up with sharp pains across my chest and shortness of breath. I was admitted to the hospital Emergency Room for about 7 hours and subsequently diagnosed with pericarditis. It is unknown if the pericarditis was associated to the vaccine but thought it was a good idea to document here.

                                                The day after injection: severe flu-like symptoms (high fever, body aches all over (former injury sites), headache. Symptoms subsided after 24 hrs. The following days featured muscle cramps all over my body, brought on by exercise. Calves cramped the most with the left calf being injured from cramps. Upper shoulders and neck muscles seized. &#39;Hot spots&#39; on my torso. Skin very sensitive to touch on side and back. Sleeping a lot more than usual. Fatigue has lasted a week. A week later and muscles are feeling somewhat better. Skin still very sensitive. Still more tired than usual. Still avoiding exercise until muscles feel 100%.

I fell asleep one hour into my arrival and slept for 17 hours. Up to and including today I am having headaches, pain in my legs on left side only, nausea, lack of sleep and a continued smell similar to dried blood after a injury. I have also have and continue to have shortness of breath and chest pains resulting in two panic attacks within the last three days. This has led me to report this and I have doctor visit scheduled for 4/22. I also reported today based on internet search of reactions.

                                                I was fine following the shot.  But when I awoke the next day, I felt Dehydrated, with a headache, and feeling exhausted, much like a hangover, but I had no alcohol in several days.  I kept hydrating myself throughout the day but was not able to concentrate on work very well.  Ended up taking Ibuprophin at my Wife&#39;s (nurse&#39;s) urging, around 3:00 PM.  Headache alleviated for the most part after but still felt exhausted until I went to bed.  I awoke fine on 3/12/21.

                                                Just before going to bed I started feeling very cold, shivering, I had similar sensation in the past when fever went up extremely quick. I did not measure my body temperature because I immediately ran under the blanket. Icy-cold hands and feet, even after my body temperature seemed to stabilize. I fell asleep but not a restful sleep. I woke up after 2.5 to 3 hours with the feeling that it was morning, but in fact it was between 2am and 3 am. At that point I felt the worst part had gone, I felt weak and with muscle aches but I could drink water and go back to bed. I did not have a restful sleep all night and I woke up may times. By the morning I was tired but no fever.

Around 2:30am the following morning (April 13, 2021) I started feeling ill. I had flu-like symptoms including: body aches, chills, fatigue, etc. I did not take my temperature, however, I believe I was feverish. I took 400mg of Ibuprofen around 11:30am (24 hours after receiving the vaccine). After sleeping for 2 hours, I began feeling better.

                                                I started sweating profusely within 30 min of the shot. Was light headed and dizzy for approximately 4-5 hrs. Once the sweating stopped I felt severe pain in both knees and ankles. If felt as if you were trying to snap my knees and ankles in half. That lasted 4-5 hrs. After I slept for a few hrs over night I woke up and felt pretty good. Approximately 3-4 hrs after I woke up I felt light headed and nauseated for approximately 3-4 hrs. I felt pretty much back to normal into the third day after the shot. I was slightly light headed and fatigued for approximately 8 days after the shot. After about the 8th day I felt normal again. I said I will never get that shot again. Approximately 25 years ago I had gotten my first flew shot and I was very sick for a week. Never received another flew shot again. Besides the stress and anxiety issues I am a healthy guy. Every 2 years we get full blood work up and my blood levels have always been spot on of where they should be.

Two days later, he developed shingles.  They started as a red rash spot in the middle of his back, approximately the size of 2 quarters, 2 days after the vaccine.  On the 3rd day, the red rash was apparent along the right side of his midsection.  Blisters started to appear on day 4.

                                                I had some head pressure - dull headache each day for a couple of weeks starting about five days after vaccine; I didn&#39;t notice until the evenings when I was relaxing. From day 5 or so - for about two weeks I noticed this head pressure. My blood pressure did rise  at that time-it was elevated - within about two weeks after the shot, I couldn&#39;t control my blood pressure. I went to the doctor  - they had to raise my blood pressure medication to the max because I couldn&#39;t get my blood pressure down and I even donated blood.  Today I am at 135 over 90 which is good for me but at that time  when I noticed the rise after the vaccine - I was running 165 over 115 . I&#39;m still taking the maximum blood pressure medication that I can take currently but it is at a good level currently. I was taking 20 mg pills and after the vaccine we tried to raise it to  25 mg and then raised it up to 30 mg and then they finally said up to 40 mg a day. It&#39;s the most I can take.   I have chest pains on the right side of my chest -it will start (on a scale from 1 to 10 -  it&#39;s about a four) - it&#39;s shooting pain - in my chest for about 10 minutes and then it will move to my left side - not my pecs -  it feels like it&#39;s my  heart. It&#39;s not enough that I feel like I&#39;m having a heart attack - it happens about four days a week. It doesn&#39;t last real long - but it&#39;s intense. A &#34;4&#34; pain for me is intense. It goes on for about 5 minutes - switch sides and then another five minutes - I try to relax/watch tv during that.  I did have leg pains in the middle of all of this time - hand, inner thigh, then on my right leg - single spots of pain that moved - like ant bites - that happened in the beginning - at day five and after - the same time I was getting the head pressure. I would rub over the spot with my hands and then it would go away and go to a different spot.

By the 2nd night  I had a headache that was unbelievable.  I eventually took Tylenol 48 hrs after the shot and it barely helped the headache. I never ever get sick never have headaches. It was bad. I was also super super irritable and I am generally a happy person. I was so bothered by everyone I was sorta angry at them it was weird. By Sunday night my headache was even worse so bad in my neck on my left side that I had the shot, I could barely move my head. I took Tylenol recommended dose. I finally fell asleep on Sunday night 3 days later midnight sweaty again.   Monday morning I woke up and I never felt better. On top of the world amazing.  I felt not  just good but extra good. Ready to go for it all.  It was a very strange experience for over three days. I typically get the flu shot, I stay healthy and never had an experience like this, I don?t get sick luckily. Any I wanted to share this because it was so strange and no one warned me really. .  I have felt great since and am thankful I had the shot.

                                                Patient received Johnson&amp;Johnson COVID vaccine in the afternoon on 3/31/21. Patient reported having right arm pain, diaphoresis, chills, nausea, and muscle aches/pain in upper leg/lower back at 5:30am the following morning. Patient took 2 tablets of 500mg naproxen in the morning and in the afternoon. Symptoms did not resolve and patient had to leave work early. Upon getting home patient took 2 tablets of 650mg tylenol and symptoms resolved within 48 hours. On 4/3/21 patient reported mild to severe pain in heel of left foot. The following day the patient went to WellNow urgent care to get his heel examined. During examination provider noticed patient&#39;s lesions and patient stated more lesions have appeared since getting the vaccine.  1 on his stomach, 1 on the dorsum of his left foot, 1 on his back, 1 on his left elbow, in between his toes of his left foot, and in between the fingers of his right hand. Patient stated that these lesions cause a burning sensation and can become itchy. Patient was sent to Hopsital ED as provider at urgent care was concerned patient may have purpura. Patient was seen and discharged on 4/4/21 from the ED. The heel pain was determined to be plantar fascitis which was treated with at home exercises with a heel cup. The patient was given clotrimazole for his lesions. The patient had a follow-up visit with his primary care provider at hospital on 4/6/21 in which he explained the clotrimazole only made his lesions worse. Patient was referred to follow up with dermatology on 4/8/21. Primary care provider believes progression of the lesions since getting the vaccine leads to concern of an underlying autoimmune exacerbated by vaccine.

I just thought it would be best to report any effects to the vaccine.

Body shaking, extreme fatigue, feverish, significant aching in upper half of body including head. Tinnitus.   After cold/flu symptoms subsided, heavy fatigue and some tinnitus persisted for 20 days. This was followed by approx. five days of tapering fatigue, after which approx 95% of symptoms had subsided. Unclear 5 weeks later if symptoms are 100% subsided, as diminished activity and exercise over three week period has left an unclear sense of physical norm (I suspect the symptoms are 100% subsided and my energy will return to normal with resumption of exercise habits).

Chills, body ache and headache were so bad that I could barely walk.   4.  Fever and headache subsided after about 35 hours.

                                                About 20 hours after injection, I had mild flu-like symptoms, including headache and muscle ache, lasting about 12 hours. But about 5 days after my injection (5 days &#43; 5 hours, actually), I experienced a bewildering all-over rash that freaked me out. It started as itching around my elbows and ankles -- it felt like mosquito bites and sunburn together -- and spread to wrist and knee areas. The rash climbed by legs and arms. I applied coat after coat of Benadryl, which seemed to help. The rash would disappear and move somewhere else. I had it on my left foot, but then that resolved, only to find it on my right foot. After about 3 hours, it had spread to my stomach, the bridge of my nose, and my cheeks. It started to calm down around midnight. I woke up at 6:00 am (12 hours after onset) with extremely itchy hands. At 8:00 am (14 hours after onset), it had mostly disappeared except for patches on my back, and my wrists still itch. I&#39;m hoping it goes away later today! It was crazy!

                                                First, pain around the injection site; it appeared within a few hours after the injection, but it was bearable.  Then, after about 23 hours after the injection, bad headache (especially around the eyes - which also caused light sensitivity) and general malaise. Shortly thereafter, low-grade fever (99.5 F) and significant muscle pain, all over the body.  The most worrisome side effect was the last one, which appeared during the second night after the injection (about 32-33 hours after the injection): extremely fast heartbeat / racing heart.   I did not use any treatments for these side effects.

                                                About 10 minutes after injection, got dizzy/clammy. It took about 5-10 minutes after that with EMTs to wait until my blood pressure normalized, and then I was fine.  Walked off site.  Slowly throughout the day had an increasingly bad headache, which peaked about 10 hours after the injection. Around that same time, bad fatigue started, and then slight chills. The headache at this point was extremely severe for about 10-12 hours. After that (so 20-22 hours after initial injection) the fatigue and chills subsided, but came back occasionally. The headache was less severe at that point, but in total did not go away until an additional 15 hours had passed.   My estimate is that took about 36-40 hours to feel 100% normal again.

This lasted for several hours after... At 11:30pm, almost 7 hours after the shot, I started to feel lousy. I started to get body aches and chills. Within 30 minutes they were fairly intense body aches and chills, shaking. At 1:00am I started to feel nauseas . At 1:30 am I started dry heaving. At approximately 2:30 I threw up twice, and the dry heaving and nausea lasting until 4am , when I took an anti nausea pill. I finally fell asleep at 430am. I woke up at 8am and felt tired, and no longer nauseated.

My shoulder is still stiff on the opposite side of the injection site at this time.  My doctor told me it might be sinus pressure and he put me on some steroids - had a five day dose and I finished them.

After use of benadryl the hives became more red, less raised, and resembled a confluent measles rash. From association with hives I experienced ear pruritus, sore throat, nausea. And fatigue. Hydrocortisone creme was used on the rash.

Again temp was checked and was normal. He stated that his breathing was improving, but he was taking rest of day off.

We were both fine but he had side effects on the higher/ more severe end. Lasting about 24 hours where it then began to break into cold clammy sweats (he did use Tylenol starting about 3-4:00pm on the 25th and by the morning of the 26th he felt much better. The Vaccine did not write our lot number on our vaccine cards - I have to call and attempt to find out. I am reporting this in case it is helpful for others.  He did not have to be admitted anywhere but he would say that for those first 24 hours he was having side effects more on the severe side.

                                                I received the J&amp;J vaccine on 3/24, and by that evening I had a headache, and my tinnitus was louder than normal. I had mild barely perceptible tinnitus prior to the vaccine. I would normally never notice it during the day, but lying down and going to sleep in a quiet room I would hear it. Constant high pitch but not loud, in the background more. I always run a fan in my bedroom so that I have some white noise and don&#39;t hear it. I had the flu like headache from the vaccine for two days and then it slowly started to subside into the weekend. I was tired as well from the immune response.  Five days out, I get out of the shower in the morning, and go to put underarm deodorant on, and notice my left armpit is all bright red. I check my right armpit, just as red.. Took photos of the red armpits and shared with some family and friends, as I read on the Internet that there were all kinds of crazy side effects that were possible. The red skin like rash is one of them, although my armpits never itched or burned. I could feel that they were warmer than normal, that was it. It was the 2nd day after my red armpits that my tinnitus ratcheted up to the current level that I am really unhappy with. The red armpits went away within 48 hours, never did anything about the redness, just didn&#39;t put underarm deodorant on until it passed. Sadly, the Tinnitus has remained and it is at a level that is distracting and persistent.

The following day, (10th) flu-like symptoms. Those resolved the day after that (11th) - I was still tired but didn&#39;t have the aches and pains of the flu. Then on starting on the day after all of that (12), I had mild and intermittent pain in my right hamstring. That persisted for a couple of days - it would come and go throughout the day and even throughout the night. It resolved after about 2 1/2 days . The pain  made it uncomfortable to sit. (I had scheduled a dr appt  at noon on the 14th, but I felt fine by then - in the morning of that day when I woke up it had gone away - I&#39;d fallen asleep on the 13th.)  I cancelled my doctor appt since it had resolved.

I also had irregular heart beat for 16-18 hours. I have had neurological issues with 2 other medications in the past which calmed my concerns. I had my arms lock up on me while on Humira and I had the exact facial numbness and tingling with Enbrel. Both of those drugs work through TNF cells. I do not know the mechanism with J&amp;J vaccine but wanted you to know that.

The patient was hospitalized for shortness of breath, heart rate increased, runny nose, and chills 28 days prior to vaccination.  The patient went to the emergency room 2 days prior to vaccination because his toenails/skin on his toes were coming off, swelling in his right foot and up his leg, gangrene in his toe; he reported that there was no circulation going to his toe and was diagnosed with having a blood clot in his right leg; the patient reported he had surgery to &#34;open up&#34; the arteries in his leg. Four days after vaccination, the patient felt hot and reported reported that he may need to have his right pinky (fifth) toe amputated because it has gangrene.  The patient is taking paracetamol as treatment.  No other details was reported.  Based on the lack of temporal association, the causality is considered not related for the events blood clot in leg, shortness of breath, heart rate increased, right leg swelling, right foot swelling, chills, and runny nose.  The information available regarding event gangrent of fifth toe and feeling hot precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

Went to bed at my usual time and woke up at 2:00 am with the chills I could not get warm late that night around 5:00 am I started having joint pain and fatigue with a headache and hot skin. I had taken my temperature and it was 100.7. I tried to wait out symptoms but I seem to bee get worse throughout the morning. Around 10:00 am I was in terrible pain and my body hurt all over. I once again took my temperature and it had gone up to 101.9. I had to call of work because I was so ?out of it?.  I started taking Tylenol ever 4 hrs for my fever and I was trying to hydrate.  My temperature slowly went down but still had body pain. I then started thank ibuprofen to help. Later that night around 9:00 pm my temperature was 99. The next day I called off work for fatigue and body pain. Today my temperature is normal and I?m starting to feel like my self again

The next morning my joints ached and I had a sore throat.  I took a couple of Ibuprofen (200 mg each) and about an hour later, my aches started going away.  By 8 pm the next day, I didn&#39;t have many side effects.

About 1 hour later I started getting the cold chills, a headache and shaking.  About 1 more hour later I had a fever, achy joints and muscle aches.  The symptoms lasted through the night until about 8:30 the next morning when I started sweating.  I decided then to take aceteminiphen and Naproxen.  This helped me to feel a little better.  Side effects were resolved after 24 hours

Pt was quite anxious &amp; nervous (but already has severe anxiety). Pharmacist called patient following afternoon, the 11th and patient noted he was doing marginally better but still sounded anxious. Pharmacist called patient on Fri the 12th 5:16p and this was when the patient explained the following: Muscle stiffness on left side &amp; pain down left leg; cranial pain; shoulder stiffness; nasal congestion; some shortness of breath; soreness &amp; fatigue.  Patient called back and said he had partial shortness of breath at 7:34p on the 12th.  On Sat the 13th at 11am, pharmacist called to check on pt; found him quite agitated &amp; saying, &#34;He feels the shot was botched&#34;, noted he had called Janssen to report his issues.  At 4:30pm, pt came to pharmacy, looked fine, arm showed no redness, was more subdued in person than on the phone earlier. He said he was feeling better but was not happy with Janssen and wanted the Moderna 2 series shot because he feels Janssen&#39;s vaccine wasn&#39;t doing what it was supposed to.

                                                Chills on the same day starting approximately 9 hours after vaccine injection.  Little to no sleep that same night.  Very restless, tossing and turning, not tired - very awake (which is unusual).  Next morning, arose at 5am with moderate chills, moderate all over body aches, and moderate headache - very symptomatic of the regular flu.   Felt bad enough to call out of work.  As of this moment, roughly 33 hours later, it seems to be subsiding, but unsure if that&#39;s just the Advil. * Note:  Vaccine is &#34;Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Lot # 1805031 administered.

Body aches and headache.  It&#39;s almost 48 hours since vaccination and we both still feel tired and have mild headaches.    Was advised these are all normal side effects, but should be reported anyway.  Side note: Wife had severe dehydration 24 hours after.  I believe this was the only not listed side effect.  No treatments, just waiting it out.  Reactions seem to lesson each day.

Soon, this was accompanied by dull but severe pain in left shoulder and upper left back (top of scapula and around collar bone), extending to base of neck. This pain lasted 2 weeks, and was severe enough to prevent patient from sitting or standing for more than a few minutes at a time, especially during the first week of pain. Painkillers (Acetaminophen or NSAIDs) or muscle relaxants (cyclobenzaprine) did not help alleviate the pain. The pain started on March 17, and finally eased up on April 2 (the vaccination was on March 13). There is still some pain and stiffness in the left arm (currently in the biceps), but it is no longer severe. By the way, in addition to the above symptoms starting at 96 hours, there were the usual expected systemic symptoms immediately after the vaccination (starting at 6 hours and ending at 36 hours): light fever, mild body ache, fatigue and mild local pain at injection site.

My resting heartbeat is normally around 68 to 70. When monitoring my heartbeat through my Watch, I experience a heart rate of 100 to 120 beats per minute and I could feel it was irregular too. I had a very restless night, elected not to go to the ER and the symptoms were gone by about noon, although I did have a terrible headache all morning long.

On 4/6/21 I came home from work about 7:00 am due to an extreme headache and muscle weakness. By the afternoon my fever was up to 101. On 4/7 my fever went up to 102.7 and I was shaking uncontrollably, sweating , dizzy, headache, and had heaviness in my chest. I felt as if I were going to have a stroke. The headache was excruciating. I took acetaminophen 500 x 2 and 400 mg of ibuprofen, and Theraflu to try and alleviate the symptoms. On 4/9/21 my fever broke, but the weakness, dizziness and headaches have continued. I currently have ongoing headaches and dizziness. I have not gone to the doctor because I do not have a PCP. I am looking for one now.

I was also feeling tired and unsteady. 12 days after the shot I became very sick for 10 days with severe diarrhea, no energy,  stomach pains, weak, shaking, no more motivation.  I saw a doctor and was given antibiotics to stop the diarrhea. Now 1 month after I have no diarrhea but still get nausea and shakes . I feel very anxious and will see a therapist and prescribe medication for my anxiety that I have due to the vaccine reaction.  I took the vaccine so I can travel abroad much easier but now afraid to travel because of my symptoms.  I will get blood tested tomorrow to see if all is ok.  This vaccine is very dangerous as it has affected my DNA.

                                                Received Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine on April 1st. Had fever for one day (after 20 hours and lasted less than a day). Took Tylenol 2 doses in 6 hour interval. After a week or so, small red dots (few) under the skin appeared in my fore arms. Subsequently after another week or so, I noticed large number of red dots in my legs. Checked with my primary care physician on 4/28/21 and she ordered blood tests. Blood test report (CBC With Differential/Platelet; Comp. Metabolic Panel (14)) came back and my doctor said, no abnormalities were there. She also tested/checked my lungs, presence of fever (no fever), oxygen saturation - max present. She thought this seems like &#39;Petrichiae&#39;. She recommended I see a dermatologist. Meanwhile, today (5/2/2021), I  noticed another large cluster of red dots on my left arm.

He was transferred to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a flesh eating bacteria in the right leg where the pain was at and Sepsis.  He was taken to surgery to debride the right leg and was started on CVVHD because his new kidney was now failing, he eventually was started back on Hemodialysis and taken to surgery 2 more times where he cardiac arrested on the table in surgery and died.  A private autopsy is being performed but the preliminary results shows he had multi-system organ failure, including his liver which was NEVER a problem in the past.

                                                Patient initially presented with meningitis-like syndrome with altered mentation, fever, headache, neck stiffness and found to have multifocal brain (predominantly brainstem lesions).  He was initially started on empiric meningitis coverage (ceftriaxone, vanc, ampicillin, acyclovir) which was stopped when CSF tests/cultures returned negative and he improved. Around 10 days later he then developed Guillain-Barre syndrome with ascending weakness of legs and inflammation of cauda equina nerve roots and inflammatory involvement of spinal cord as well causing weakness, numbness, autonomic dysfunction (cardiac arrhythmias) and urinary retention. He was treated with 5 day course of IVIG and improved enough to go to acute rehab. Diagnosis was ultimately concluded as atypical Bickerstaff&#39;s encephalitis or idiopathic inflammation of the brain, spinal cord and nerve roots without no other causative event identified other than recent vaccination

He sat down on a chair about 30 minutes just to relax.  Before the shot, he was pretty nervous about getting vaccinated (needles) and his fiance told me that he hardly gets vaccinated in the past because he is afraid of needles. She was not sure if his reaction is because of his nervousness about the vaccine or if it is an allergic reaction. I told his fiance who was with him the whole time, to take him to the ER if he is having hard time breathing or if his dizziness gets prolonged.  I tried calling patient and her fiance  on 5/10/21 vaccination day, and 5/12/21 again and left message to follow up but no answer/ call back.

                                                Initial symptoms began with pain at the injection site and generalized fatigue.  This developed into soft tissue pain in proximity of the large and small joints which could be elicited further on palpation.  I had eye pain (left more severe than the right) which could be further elicited on palpation, headache, dizziness, chills, and an inability to feel warm.  There was also significant skin sensitivity over the trunk, scalp, and upper extremities and more in the left arm than the right.  The symptoms persisted over the second day albeit at less severity.  Presently on the third day, I am experiencing continued eye pain, mainly in the left eye and mild dizziness.

I gave him 2 Extra strength Acetaminophen (500 mg each).  At 7:15 pm his fever had risen to 105.8.  At that time, I gave him 2 Advil (200mg. each).  By 8:00 pm his fever started to break and was 102 degrees.  I continued to alternate Acetaminophen and Advil every few hours.  By the morning of 3/13/21 his fever was back to normal.  He was left feeling extremely tired and had a terrific headache. By Monday, March 15 he was feeling much better.

We quickly checked his temperature however it was within normal range. We applied cold packs to his wrists, forehead, and face for about 12 minutes. I checked for normal capillary refill and asked him questions to assess his mental status. About 20 minutes after starting the treatment, patient started improving. He returned almost back to normal in about 30 minutes.

Around 3:35pm, 9-1-1 was called due to worsening chest pain and scratchy throat. EMTs directed me to administer 25mg of diphenhydramine (which as give at 3:46pm) to patient. EMTs arrived shortly thereafter, noting elevated BP (~154/90). Patient left pharmacy area ~4:10pm and was brought to ER via paramedics for further evaluation.

Arm is hard to lift up at some times and weak to lift anything up sometimes. Arm feels week for about 2 to 3 days and then starts to fill better. Then after a day of the soreness or no weakness in the arm, it starts back hurting again. It now getting worse at night time and sometimes during the day. Some days it hurts so bad that I can&#39;t even move it. I don&#39;t bother to tell my wife, because it just last for about a 2 to 3 hours. I have been to my doctor yet. But if it keeps bothering me I will make an appointment to see him.  It just my arm and hand be very weak to use at sometimes every other day.

This was accompanied by a stiff neck. This pain and stiffness persists to today. Medication prescribed by my doctor lessens the discomfort but has not rid me of the issue.

                                                About 11 hours after I took the shot, I start feeling very hot and my whole body started shivering very badly from toe to head, I had extremely bad headache,  felt nauseous and my whole body was hurting. I took 2 Tylenol 650mg but it did not do anything. My temperature was high (reached 101). The whole thing lasted  few hours non stop. After that, I have light to moderate headaches almost every day (till this day)

By 8:00, I was feeling tired enough that I went to bed early.  By 9:00, I had terrible chills and body aches throughout my body.   The aches were worse in my chest / torso -- maybe from so much shaking.  I did not watch any of the men&#39;s championship game that night.  I also felt nauseous but I seemed to lack the strength to vomit.  I can not remember a time when I had so much physical pain in my life.  My hands felt numb / tingling.  I tried to drink some ginger ale but drinking was difficult.  Although I was aware that I was breathing and my heart was beating, I thought that I might die.  The terrible pain continued for a few hours.  Around 10:30 PM, the pain dissipated.  However, after about 10 minutes of relief, the pain returned, perhaps worse than before.  At around 11:30, my wife came to bed.  She suggested that I try relaxing Yoga breathing.   I did that and the pain stopped and I fell asleep.   The next day, I woke up with a typical headache and took more Tylenol.  I continued to improve the remainder of the day.

                                                Symptoms started to appear about half an hour to forty-five minutes after the vaccination:  1. The first set of symptoms were that I felt light-headed and I could feel that my neck muscles were a little bit tense when I moved my head to the sides. This first set of symptoms lasted about two to two-and-a-half hours before tapering off. 2. The second symptom which were chills started about three to three-and-a-half hours after vaccinations. The chills lasted about four hours before tapering off. 3. The last symptom was fever that started about nine to ten hours after the vaccination. The fever lasted for about twelve to fourteen hours  and tapered off the following morning.

                                                Severe headache. Full head headache, not a simple sinus headache. I felt like I was hungover. Lasted for 2 days. Tylenol, Advil both helped. Pushed fluids to make sure I was not dehydrated. Had some coffee to make sure it wasn&#39;t caffeine withdrawal. Headache became less severe over time. By the third day it was pretty much gone.  Possibly unrelated, starting 04/11/2021 through 04/15/2021 I had severe insomnia. I could not sleep longer than 1-2 hours. Very active mentally while trying to fall asleep. My brain was constantly churning over thoughts, emotions, work, not work, etc. I struggled to just calm my head and go to sleep.  The night of 04/15/2021 I slept 3.5 hours. I was very physically active on 04/16/2021 and slept 10 hours that night (last night). Active today, but back to having trouble going to sleep.

Went to urgent Care on 4/8 where treated for severe dehydration and stomach aligment.  From 4/9 - 4/14 continued to suffer from same symptoms and then began to have heart taching, feeling as if there was a bubble in my chest.  Went back to Urgent Care on 4/14 and was again treated for dehydration.  Outcome is that no one knows why I have been feeling this way except for that it is a direct result of receiving the vaccine.

Just want to know if he died from Covid or an adverse reaction from Johnson and Johnson vaccine he received in jail. No one wants to test his blood. He&#39;s at the mortuary awaiting cremation, and I thought it best if some government entity drew some blood to determine if he&#39;s a Covid or vaccine reaction fatality.  Before they cremate his body.

It has not gone away. It has grown about a centimeter more in diameter over the past 2 weeks. I noticed I have been coughing a lot and I have been having to use my inhaler and I have congestion. I don&#39;t know if its seasonal allergies or due to the shot. I have had to use my inhaler which I NEVER do. It is Ventolin.

                                                Lightheaded about 5 minutes after injection. Medical team took HR and BP and was normal Took about 20 minutes and light headedness went away  Later that night at around 12:30 am, felt very cold and shivering with severe headache Did not take temperature Had a hard time going back to sleep Got up around 1:00 am to take 800 mg of OTC Advil When walking back up stairs had severe muscle pain in arms and legs Was fine after that Seemed to get better by 2 am No issues next day  About 7-10 days later developed severe frontal headaches/sinus pressure No other symptoms Used Neti Pot with saline solution and did nothing Took OTC allergy meds and Advil and did nothing  Say my primary care Dr and he prescribed Flonase, Singular and Allegra &#43; continue Neti Pot and Advil as needed Not much improvement on this regime after 3-5 days of use  About a week later developed severe pain in bottom right jaw Took OTC Advil and again no improvement Went to Dentist and said not tooth related but probably TMJD Recommend dental appliance to help with grinding  About a few days later after this jaw pain developed, developed sharp stabbing pain in bottom of left knee cap. No recollection of any insult that would cause this  All three of these pain sites were perfectly fine prior to getting J&amp;J vaccine.  No history of pain or injury to these areas prior  All of these incidents to me seem to be inflammatory/immune in nature and could be related to J&amp;J vaccine based upon how I reacted to injection.  Curious if others are seeing the same thing and if so what should be done or how long should this last?

In addition to this he felt pain in Right Pectoral Muscle. Patient was noticed with pale and diaphoretic appearance but within few minutes felt better with increased ventilation and cold compress.

                                                Patient was scheduled for an appointment for a Johnson &amp;Johnson  covid-19 vaccine through a drive thru Thursday April 8, 2021 @12:45pm. We arrived early and he received the vaccine at 12:15pm, waited 30 minutes for reaction and he was feeling fine. Later that same evening, the patient was driving to work on the freeway when he felt a dry throat so he coughed hard, at that cough he felt a massive pain in his head, like his &#34;head was going to explode.&#34; He immediately had tunnel vision closing in on him, so he pulled over and later woke up in our parked car with flashing emergency lights on, parked on the shoulder of the freeway. Disoriented and confused why he was there, he looked at his watch and saw he lost 15 minutes when he had passed out. MY HUSBAND COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED IF HE HAD NOT PULLED HIMSELF OVER WHEN PASSING OUT. Today we reported this to our doctors office and to you!

                                                Day 15 after covid vaccine I woke up at 12:30am with extreme vertigo and nausea. It woke me up with violent spinning. I could not focus my eyes at all. I felt very ill. I almost threw up multiple times during the day and could not move my head up or down and to the left without spinning out of control. I saw the ENT later that day and he performed the Epley Maneuver on me. I followed his directions for home care but am currently still experiencing vertigo. The doctor told me it should dissipate within one week. It has not. I have never had vertigo in the past.

                                                Lost his vaccine card would not give him a new one.  He got his vaccine, had burning sensation immediately after the needle was pulled out.  About 5-10 minutes later he started sweating, and seemed to have calmed down and felt OK.  He was observed for 30 minutes there and went for observation for another 30  minutes.  He went to another doctors office and at about 15:00 started feeling light headed and weak.  He drove back home, picked up some stuff at a grocery store, and outside the grocery store in 80 degree heat he felt the need to put on a jacket as he had the chills.  he went home, went to bed feeling bad, his shoulder was still burning where he got hte vaccin.e  He had a little bit of site pain, applied topical and the pain went away.  He woke up the next morning feeling really bad, felt like a major flu, his head felt like it was going to explode, but no problem with sinuses, no cough, no sneezing.  His eyes were watering from the pain, and chills on and off.  He had to change his sheets a couple of times due to sweating.  He then developed a fever of 99 degrees at about 18:00 that night, and about 19:00 he went to 102 when he checked it.  After that it went to 103, and about 15 minutes after that it was 104, and then higher at 104.&#43;.  He took some vodka, honey and lemon juice and took an alcohol bath and the fever had not broken yet.  He called the clinic and they told him to call 9-1- 1 and to go to the ER.  He went to the ER at about 10:00, gave him fluids, did a chest x-ray and released him about midnight.  He apparently disoriented and tried to walk off and didn&#39;t remember this.  They took him back to the gate and called his son.  He went home, took another bath and woke up in sweat and was in bed for the entire weekend.  He got up Monday morning, 4/13/21 feeling a little bit better and went to see his doctor, who does not believe he was having any side effects and that the information that is being reported is true.   He is still feeling a little weak and still fatigued and on bedrest.  He was taking Advil besides his regular medicines every 6 hours with 500 mg of Tylenol for the intense pain as every joint in his body ached, and the worst headache he had ever had, as well as the high fevers.  His fever subsided on Saturday morning, and still had some sweats following that.  Did have hot/cold flashes on Saturday and Sunday.   He was given a COVID test in the ER and he was negative, but did not give him any other information regarding his lab work.

Fever kept going through the second night, developed several small itchy bumps on body, and also developed pain in lower abdomen.  On the third day went to an urgent clinic because of lower abdomen pain and felt as though my diverticulitis had started.  Was prescribed antibiotics, Flagyl and Cipro, for the diverticulitis.  Fever broke that night I believe.

                                                I started with shivers, then a few hours later I had a fever and a bad headache. I took one Tylenol but that did not help after several hours. I took another and that still didn&#39;t help. I started feeling sick to my stomach, then I vomited several times. After emptying my stomach, I started feeling better. After 24 hours after the shot, I felt fine.  Then, again, 12 days after the shot, I got another bout of similar symptoms. I had a headache, stomach ache, then vomited. After a few hours of rest, I felt fine again.

                                                I believe this vaccination adversely affected my kidneys.  the day after the injection I was drinking lots of water to help overcome the side effects (flu like symptoms) and was not using the bathroom very much and when I did, very little urine would come out.  very tired, I went to sleep around 8 PM and by 11 PM woke up because I needed to urinate.   several times that night I urinated after waking up with a very full Blatter.  this tells me that my kidneys may have been negatively affected and once the flue like systems started to subside the kidneys were returning to normal and clearing out the excess water my body had taken in during the day.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805029 expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 15-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported. On 15-MAR-2021, the patient received the vaccine, waited at facility for 15 minutes, and everything was okay.  On 17-APR-2021, the patient experienced neck ache, muscle ache and felt a sense of tiredness, headache, sleepiness, which he treated with Aleve (naproxen sodium). He also noticed his feet had a rash from his knee to feet, and according to his sister (who is a healthcare professional) it looked like small micro-embolisms (thrombocytopenia). The patient went to his physician who said the spotty red dots could be petechiae caused by thrombocytopenia.  As recommended by his primary care physician, the patient has an appointment for lab work, including platelet counts, on 20-APR-2021. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from headache, tiredness, neck ache, rash from knee to feet (red dots), muscle ache, and possible thrombocytopenia, and the outcome of sleepiness was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 53-year-old male patient was found to have petechiae-like rash on his knees to feet, that according to attending physician could be caused by thrombocytopenia, 2 days after receiving Janssen COVID-19 vaccine for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The patient underwent laboratory procedure including platelet count (results not reported).  The patient complained of neck ache, muscle ache and felt a sense of tiredness, headache, sleepiness that he treated with Aleve (naproxen sodium) on the day the petechiae-like rash appeared.  No other details reported.  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information as requested.

A couple days later I noticed a bump on my neck which I thought was an ingrown hair or bug bite. One week later I had the same low grade fever and the &#39;bump had expanded across my neck and shoulders. Made it in to the doctor a couple days later and was diagnosed with Shingles.  There were no other life stressors that could have caused it, life was good. Now, three weeks later, the pain has diminished but still present. Nerve sensitivity remains.

Felt feverish but didn&#39;t have a fever overnight. The next day the same - general aches and pains and fatigue. Early afternoon, I took Tylenol  and at night time I had  headache and I took Tylenol again that evening (about 11:00P). Next morning, just fatigue - no more aches. Site of vaccination was more sore than initially. I had a sort of sinus headache - left side of face and head. My wife noticed I had bags under my eyes - very odd bags under eyes. I took Sudafed. Inside of my left nostril was aching. Tuesday morning, the bags weren&#39;t there but I got bad acne on the same nostril - my left nostril. It was like - I was worried that the acne was cystic  (very deep - through the nose). I haven&#39;t gotten acne in a long time. I had the sinus headache and acne which lasted two to three days. I tried nasal saline - on that Wednesday and Thursday. The acne lasted into the next week - subsided beginning on the 12th or 13th. The bagginess in eyes  had been gone by end of the 5th. Headaches didn&#39;t persist after the 7th or 8th or so.  Had trouble getting a doctor appt because they didn&#39;t know what doctor to send me to.

                                                I had Covid in June - and felt the same - fever (not real high - 101), chills, nausea, no energy, headache - lasted from 7pm ish until sometime around 5am woke up sweating and only had slight headache that went away after some fluids - it was not fun at all, but didn&#39;t last too long - I didnt take any Advil until about 2 am, then could sleep. Stayed home Monday because I could, but by noon felt nearly 100%, by 6pm felt 100%.

                                                I had no noticed issues for about 18 hours after the injection Tuesday evening.  Sometime early Wednesday afternoon I began to experience body aches, a low-grade fever, and extreme tiredness.  I slept most of the rest of the day and night and felt better when I woke up Thursday morning, well enough to go about a normal day.  It is now late Thursday afternoon and I am still a little tired and mildly achy with no fever but otherwise much improved.    One other thing to report, initially there was no pain or tenderness to the injection site but that started changing about 24 hours after the injection.  Now about 46 hours after injection the site has a constant noticeable soreness even if I am not moving my arm.

                                                Had chills in middle of night. Woke up next morning with cough that developed into asthmatic episode. Couldn&#39;t get full breaths even after multiple attempts to use rescue inhaler Proair and stronger inhaler Flovent. Went to ER. Pulse Ox was 90 at admission. After course for Medrol and nebulizer, left hospital at 94.

This happened before 25 years ago and is likely unrelated to the vaccine. Expected cold/flu-like symptoms did occur on March 14 and part of March 15 but things have been fine since then. I&#39;ve followed up with my GCP and am scheduling a Neuro appointment for followup.

                                                About 18 hours after vaccination, I began to feel myalgias and burning skin while in the shower; I began to feel &#34;hot&#34; and very fatigued. Then my temperature went up to 101.9 degrees F, taken by an electronic touchless digital thermometer. Then, the L Deltoid vaccination site began to feel very sore. As the day went on, I felt increasingly fatigued and exhausted,  and had trouble concentrating.   I felt better the 2nd day after vaccination, but felt intermittent myalgias, increasing L Deltoid soreness, and hot and chilled at the end of the day.  Today, I felt better in the morning, exceptfor persistent L deltoid soreness, and fatigue. This evening, I am feeling cold, tired, and myalgias again.

I figured that the pain would go away but the pain increased and my leg started swelling and the pain increased making it very difficult for me to put my leg down on the ground and put pressure on my right leg.

                                                Arm pain and swelling began immediately. Later in the evening on same day of shot, I began to experience nausea.  Next morning pain, swelling and nausea persisted. Medium intensity body aches and headache began late morning. By mid afternoon body pain increased to the point that I was no longer able to function and needed to lie down.  Took a 4 hour nap. Side effects persisted after waking up.  At time of writing, 28hrs after vaccine, I am still feeling the side effect although less severe. Ibuprofen and Tylenol  do seem to help.

                                                Early morning woke up with bad headache, diarrhea throughout the day,  vomited early evening all on Friday April 2nd.  Started to feel better in the evening and started to drink a bit of gatorade.  However Saturday morning April 3rd woke up between 6-7am and went to the bathroom and turned around to walk back out and blacked out - most likely dehydrated.   Fortunately did not fall down as my wife caught me slumped up against the wall and got me down to the floor.  After 5-10 minutes was able to get back to bed and after another hour or so was able to start drinking fluids and keep them down through the day.   By late afternoon/early evening had a small meal and was starting to feel better - never did have a fever (checked frequently on Friday and Saturday)

About a day later, I was fine but tired. Approximately 3 weeks later on April 9th, I had sharp pain in my lower back when I breathed in and my neck lympth nodes were swollen and sore. I am fine now and the only reason I am reporting this is to document symptoms for your research efforts. Thank you.

Went to work next day still feeling rundown with muscle fatigue but chills not as bad . Went home after full work day to rest then go to bed early. Next day felt fine .  All in all I had a great experience . The people (organizers and others ) at the location that day did a fantastic job. Easy Breezy .

I developed extreme fatigue, muscle aches, skin hurt to the touch of anything including clothing, headache, and fever 101.5.  I had to go to bed and was very weak.  I took ibuprofen and Tylenol for the discomfort.  I slept 14 hours and was able to get up at 11:00 A.M. on March 13, 2021.  The soreness at the site of the injection is not problematic.  There were other odd symptoms overnight I would awake with strange nerve like sensations tingling and itching that occurred on the bottom of the left foot, upper lip, and neck.  I also had several episodes of restlessness that was so bad that I had to stand for a few minutes before being able to lay down again.  The worst is the skin hurting and headache.  I have also had a few dizzy episodes since getting out of bed this morning.  It passes if I sit down or hold onto something.  None of these symptoms are normal for me and I cannot remember having a reaction to any vaccinations that I have received in the past.  I hope this helps with your study.

At night I had a mild fever, chills, body aches (everywhere) unbearable headache (still going on 24 hours after the shot), pain at the vaccination site (left shoulder, still strong after 24 hours), pain in the lungs (I sneezed a couple of times).  I took Tylenol every 4 hours, but did not improve, only brought the fever down a bit.  Today after 24 hours, I still have headache, muscular aches, and fatigue.

                                                I shortly after the shot I having had random pains in arm, including joints [like when the pressure changes ... don&#39;t think I have arthritis]) but they only lasted a few minutes and then would go away.  About 10 hours later I started feeling sick.  One of the first things I noticed besides a headache was my heart rate jumped up to over 100 beats per minute (it is normally below 84).  I started getting chills and fever.  It was worse than any flu fever I ever had and I could not sleep.  Worst part was my heart rate would not go down, remaining above 100 but below 110-115 beats per minute.  I considered calling 911 but after looking online decided not to as long as it remained below 120 bpm.  I don&#39;t know my maximum temperature - I did not think to take it until after the peak had passed by 20 minutes or so (was 99.4 at that point - normal temperature runs 97.2 (low 96.8, high 98.2)).  Heart rate finally started to drop around 3:30 am.

                                                I gave client his vaccine. I gave one other vaccine and noticed that he was pale and putting his head down. I asked if he felt alright. He said he was dizzy. He was at this point dizzy, pale, sweating, low heart rate in the 30&#39;s. We put a cold wet rag on the back of his neck and monitored. We gave him some cold water also. Slowly over the next 5-10 minutes his stats got better, color returned, and was not sweating anymore. He did not feel dizzy anymore.  We monitored for an additional 30 minutes. Gave instructions. Sent home with spouse.

                                                Pt wanted to test BP prior to shot. Rph said pt BP was a little high so they waited and took BP again a minute or 2 later. BP had gone down some, so they agreed to proceed. After dose, pt was dizzy, sweaty, unresponsive for a short time. Once he was more responsive, we helped him sit on the floor against the wall as he was quite dizzy. We called 911 and pt refused transport to hospital, but was evaluated.

He went home and  laid down and fell asleep.  When he woke up he called his PCP because he wasn&#39;t feeling well.  His heart rate was running from 80-90 and fluctuating like he was about to have a heart attack. He was told to call back if he wasn&#39;t feeling better.  On 4/9  his heart  was running about 90-115.  On 4/10 his heart was running from 139-142.  He called his doctors office and they told him to go to the ER.  He went to hospital.   He was given heart  EKG, labs  and IV.  He was given aspirin.  His INR was at 2.  His heart rate came down to 115.   His blood was low.  His DX was Sinus Tachycardia.  He was admitted to the Heart Floor.  He was treated for 2 days and released.  They told him they thought he was reacting to taking the vaccination and to FU w/ PCP.  He said his heart rate is fluctuating  and is currently at 101.  He doesn&#39;t see a Cardiologist since he cannot have open heart surgery due to his underlying health conditions.

                                                Approximately eight hours after receiving the shot, I started getting a headache, body aches, and chills (April 3rd, 8 p.m.).  I went to bed and had severe chills and body sweats for the entire night.  The primary symptom to report is that my heart raced all night.  It felt like it was beating at about 140 to 150 Hz or higher.  When I woke up in the morning, it felt like my chest had been pounded on all night.  The pain was in my sternum area.  The headache and body aches took a little over a day to go away.  The chest pain took a couple of days to die down.  On April 12th, I walked my dogs in the morning and felt out of breath, which isn&#39;t normal for me.  In the afternoon, while working at my desk at home, I started getting more and more severe chest pain and then started getting dizzy and felt weak.  I drove myself to the local ER and they tested me for a heart attack.  All tests came back negative.  They suggested going to another facility to get checked for clots or to make an appointment with a cardiologist.  The next day, after talking to a doctor friend, he suggested going to the ER facility to get imaged for clots and to get fully checked out.  No cardiologist appointments were available till the next week.  I went to the ER facility and was there for seven hours getting tested.  They came back and said all test results were negative and that my heart looked fine.  They did not have any suggestions for what might be causing the pain in my chest.

I had to go rest in the middle of the day. Got the chills and then sweats.  This continued for 6 more days slowly getting better.  Also developed a major sinus infection that just showed shortly after the shot. Zero symptoms prior.  In fact, had not been sick at all for the last 13 months.  I mostly slept for 6 days with chills and sweats.  Did not once have a registered fever of any degree.

When I got up at 10:30 to check and see if I had a fever, I measured it at 103.5 F.  I took 2 tylenol at 10:30 and at 130 am my fever was 102.5.  I just thought this was a larger reaction than what is typical, so I thought I would report it.   Additionally, this mass vaccination site had a number of adverse reactions (within 15 minutes of injection), so I thought I should report this to someone.   Disappointingly it is near impossible to talk to anyone on the phone these days to get or give information.  I called the VAERS phone number, but was on hold for 15 minutes and gave up.

She said my face was drooping, I couldn&#39;t smile or stand.  She called Ambulance.  Ambulance arrived and decided symptoms of stroke and called for helicopter to take me to medical center.   When I arrived they did CT and I was later told it showed possible areas of no oxygen to brain.  They gave me TPA drug and almost immediately  I could see improvement - my headache cleared.  Throughout the next couple hours I regained movement on right side and all functionality returned except weakness in right arm.  I stayed in ICU for 24 hours as required after receiving TPA and while additional tests were ran then was discharged on Friday, April 16, 2021

On 4/13/21 at approximately 2PM I started suffering from very strong headaches, the pain stretched from one side of my head (temple) to the other side of the head. In the evening of  4/13/21 the pain was so great that I was literally pounding my fist on the wall and seriously considered going to the emergency room. I started taking Advil to help deal with these intense headaches. The pain peaked on 4/14/21, this was a day that I spent in bed taking medication (Advil). On 4/15/21 the pain started to subside. By 04/17 I barely registered anymore pain.

                                                The patient is a 56 y.o. male who presents to the Emergency Department with cough and SOB for 2-3 days. The patient states he was vaccinated with the johnson and johnson COVID-19 vaccine two weeks ago. He denies any vomiting diarrhea, fevers, leg swelling, or chest pain. The patient additionally denies being around any sick contacts or any recent travel.     The patient is a 56 y.o. male evaluated for cough and SOB for 2-3 days. Possibility of pneumonia. I have lower suspicion for PE, however his oxygen saturation is less than 94%, so we will obtain a D-dimer. I have lower suspicion for ACS. Will also check COVID swab to rule out COVID despite recent vaccination.

                                                After the injection on Friday 03/12 at 1:50 PM at facility, I started to get a slight temperature, Along with chills as well. This continue throughout the weekend. I remained at home and did not have any energy to go out and be around people. The next day, I also got diarrhea and was very dehydrated.  Immediately, after I left the vaccine shot location, like within 5 minutes, I started to smell fish and my mouth tasted like salt for three days. I also had excruciating headaches that did not go away with advil. So I rested a  lot and had no real big appetite what so ever!.  Today, I am concerned that on my left side below my left clavicle, I feel a big bump what appears to be possibly a lymphatic swelling of node? I am concerned because I did not have this swelling before and do not know if it&#39;s a reaction to the vaccine.  Pls contact me via phone, this is urgent.  Thanks

                                                Skull crushing headache that started about 12 hours after injection and lasted for about 18 hours. After 48 hours from injection, headache is 90% improved. Took Advil, but that did nothing for headache.  It was the worst headache that I can ever remember having.  Extreme muscle pain in various parts of the body started at same time as onset of headache. This, too, died out as the headache got better.  Slight nausea on day #2.  No fever. Was steady at 96.6 throughout these adverse reactions.

                                                First 4 hours post injection no serious side effects, slight headache was settling in.  At approx. 8PM (7 hours after shot) I had fairly a severe reaction of horror for the next 16 hours - all night long.  Heart racing/energy beyond, deep chills and severe whole body shaking to the point of my back going out (dont&#39; have a bad back), fever, migraine headache so bad (i dont get headaches) and body aches from a horror movie.   I&#39;m a jock, run daily, healthy, no smoke, drink or drugs. This lasted all night long well into the morning. At 3Am i considered going to the ER, but didnt. By 2pm the following day most of it went away. Two days later (today) i am dizzy, heart feels fast or racing, naseuous earlier , and exhausted. I can deal with it now, but it&#39;s very uncomfortable. Frankly, I regret getting the vaccine, wish i had not.   I had covid last March, it was no big deal beyond what a flu would have done...with some shortness of breath on and off for a few months. The reaction to the vaccine is viccious compared to covid itself (for me, just my experience). Hope this all stops and goes away.   Thank you for your work!

                                                Within 12 hours of getting the shot I developed severe flu symptoms with a fever of 102&#43;, chills, severe headache, sweating, hallucinating,   I recovered from that about 35 hours later but then about 2 days later I started having a lot of unusual anger, sleeplessness, racing thoughts, and ended up having a psychotic break.  I was sent to the ER where they ran multiple tests on me to determine a cause.  No alcohol, no drugs, no bipolar, no infection.  It was determined that the vaccine was the cause of this really awful event.

Duration of blackout unknown. Woke up on floor not knowing how I got there. Sat up, nausea and lightheadedness returned, then dissipated with no further blackout. Felt rush of blood from head to toe and felt okay after that. Pharmacy staff took blood pressure, readings were close to normal (slightly elevated). Paramedics were called by pharmacy, and their BP readings were also close to normal. After all that, aside from some fatigue, no other appreciable side effects over the next 48 hours. No nausea, flu-like symptoms or fever, and very little soreness at injection site.

                                                on 4/2 the day after the vaccine a large rash with hives developed around my neck   I took benadryl 50mg and it subsided .  Then on 4/4 (sunday) I went to sleep early around 8pm  Wasnt feeling well. I woke up around 2 hours later   I had a bad rash with hives in my groin, on my torso, again on my neck, scalp and palms of my hands.  My hands were covered in hives.   I took 125mg of Benadryl at 10pm and had a prednisone prescription at home similar to a medrol dose pak   So I took 6 prednisone 5mg at 10pm and 5 prednisone 5mg early the next morning around 5am 4/5. I also added more benadryl around 2am (50mg) and 6am (50mg) By the morning  tho the rash was very visible and still raised on my palms, neck and groin.  I went to the doctor and he examined me and he felt in the absence of any other factors like new deodorant, shampoo , or new laundry soap that it was likely the vaccine.   I finished a five day course of the steroid and im completely back to normal.

Slurring words, stumbling around and general unwell feeling with a fluttery feeling in chest. No previous heart issues of any kind. After it continued for an hour or so, I took him to the ER and it was discovered that he was in AFIB. 2 rounds of meds and tests, but stayed in that rhythm. They ended up doing a cardio version and it went back into normal sinus rhythm. Follow up with dr, placed on Eliquis, EKG, stress test and sleep study have found no other contributing factors atthis point.

Shortly after the vaccine he experiencing stabbing headaches that came on quickly and went away in an instant. I thought they were gone after that but he later told me the stabbing headaches continue, along with horrible pain in his legs, and ringing in his ears. He told me recently that the symptoms stopped exactly two weeks later but his legs are hurting again.

                                                Approximately 4 minutes after the injection, while sitting down, I felt light headed, sweating, weak, face turned white. I was close to passing out but didn&#39;t. I requested attention after about 10 minutes. While being treated by medics they mentioned color had returned to my face. I felt better enough so I refused to go to hospital and was driven home. Later that morning, 03/08/2021 about 10 AM, I developed a fever and body aches with sharp pains thru out my body and joints. First temperature check was 100.5. My fever, pains/weakness increased thru out that day and overnight with chills. Highest temp check was 102.8 that evening prior to bedtime. I don&#39;t know if it could have been higher at some point overnight. It felt like I had a moderate to bad case of the FLU. The next morning, 03/09/2021 the fever broke down to about 101. By 03/11/2021, aside from a little residual weakness I felt more like myself. However, as of the writing of this report my temp seems to fluctuate between normal and 99.8. Will report this to my Doctor on next visit. Worth noting that I haven&#39;t had any Flu like symptoms to that degree in many years.

Intense muscle aches were later (approx 6-8 hrs after shot) along with overall fatigue.  A medium grade headache began 8-10 hrs after shot and continued throughout night - lowering to a slight headache within 24 hrs after shot.  Headache ended 28-30 hrs after shot.  Developed a post nasal drip and mild congestion in sinuses about 1.5 days after shot (and continues).  Numbness in toes appears to have returned with some stiffness felt in my calf muscles.

Around 9:00pm started to feel chills and tired with low grade fever (100 C). Around 1:30am started feeling right side back pain in my kidney area that woke me up. By 2:15am the pain was almost unbearable, and I could no longer lay in bed. At 3:00am I took 2x 500mg Tylenol as I debated whether to call my doctor or go straight to ER. By the 3:45am pain was subsiding and was I able to get back in bed by 4am. Today no pain.

Also at the same time, I  felt like someone was stabbing around the abdomen - felt like my usual stomach chronic pain  only it was worse than my normal chronic pain. My usual &#34;normal&#34; stomach pain is intermittent  - as far as it comes at times and goes and medications always help with it but this is different. It doesn&#39;t go away and it&#39;s all the time and my regular meds don&#39;t help.  And I have had that pain ever since the vaccine and it hasn&#39;t gone away. I&#39;m trying this: Herbal supplement - I started it three days ago - it&#39;s for gas and bloating and it seems to be helping my symptoms of pain a little bit. I have also started CBD oil and I do .50 mg at bedtime under the tongue and when I wake up my symptoms are a bit better.  On April 20th, I will see an IBS doctor.

Within the first 5 minutes, the pharmacist was alerted to the patient dropping his phone and glasses to the floor and staring off into space. The pharmacist proceeded to make contact with patient by calling their name and giving them gentle taps on the shoulder and knee. The patient &#34;came to&#34; within a few minutes stating that they could hear and see but felt as though they were &#34;off in space&#34; . Once the patient &#34;came to&#34; they were coherent but perspiring a bit.  The patient was offered water and a cool damp cloth. The patient was offered EMT services which they declined. The patient was made to wait another 15 minutes in the observation area. The patient did have a spouse with them who would be driving them home. The patient was called later in the day to by the pharmacist to see how the were feeling. The patient stated they were fine and appreciated the follow-up call.

I went to see my PCP, Dr. who ordered a CT scan of my neck. The CT scan demonstrated I had an ulcer in my throat located in my larynx box. MY PCP  doctor then referred me to  an ENT doctor, Dr. The ENT doctor gave me antibiotics and a shot in my arm. My throat kept getting worse and the ENT doctor have me reflux medicine and Prednisone and Bactrum medication. Today I woke up feeling much better although the pain and swelling to my left side of my throat and ear has gone down but I still have a sore throat and ulcer and is being treated with medicine.

It got progressively worse and spread to the front of my head too. By that evening (Sunday 3/9) it was throbbing like one of the worst headaches I have had. Monday was so bad that I  called in and didn&#39;t work. Tuesday 3/9 was still bad. Finally, Tuesday night is started letting up and was able to sleep. I still have a little headache at the back of my head, 9:00am 3/10.  Also, I couldn&#39;t sleep Sunday 3/8 and Monday 3/9 night .  I had a Tylenol 3 prescription and used it.  I was taking  2 at a time and it was not helping much.  Also mixed in some ibuprofen.

You would have to contact her directly for more information. He was found dead in his room  by the manager around 5 pm on April 22nd. Manager told me his body was cold to the touch so she thought he may have passed the previus day on April 21st.  Daughter todl me earlier today that a doctor is running some tests to try to determine the cause of death. You would need to contact her for the doctors name.  My own inpression is that the emphysema was not severe enough to have d=caused his death as he could walk up to half a mile.
