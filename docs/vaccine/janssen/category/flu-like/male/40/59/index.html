                                                On March 11th at around 10pm I experienced severe shaking, fever, headache and delirium. The next day I improved but had a fever on and off of 99.1. I felt like I was stable, but felt dizziness increasing, and was lethargic through the weekend.   Then on Monday the 15th, I had a noticeable cramp in my right abdomen. At around 8pm CST I began feeling like I needed to burp and that I had GI problems.   The problems increased that night at around 10pm I had pain where the cramp started. Two hours later I started throwing up because of the pain and feeling of too much air inside of me. I could not stop vomiting after 2 hours so went to the Hospital ED at around 2:30 AM Tuesday the 16th.   I was admitted after a CT scan showed and white cell counts confirmed and infection and drastically enlarged appendix. I was diagnosed with an appendicitis and they immediately scheduled me for surgery.

                                                Dizziness and light headed, with confusion, fatiuge, with head ache. Very severe just after injection. 3 days post vaccine and still feeling dizziness and headache with mild fatigue. Symptoms are similar to a hang over. The symptoms are slightly better than the day of vaccination but still exsist. Symptoms do seem to come and go and are not constant. Little relief is given by tylenol.

On-site nurses noticed I started to look pale and clammy and took me into evaluation room and checked my vitals. My vitals came back with low blood pressure and low oxygen levels. After resting and a cup of water, my vitals became all normal.

My body felt incredibly hot but I did sweat at all. If I would move the bed covers and any part of my skin below my neck felt the air I would get chills the would shake my entire body for a few seconds.  Later that morning; body aches all over, a fever reaching 101.3, fatigue. Over the counter medicines, napping, and a shower helped reduce symptoms.  All was gone by the next morning.

                                                Experienced moderate debilitating flu symptoms day after vaccination and recovered the following day.  Over one week later (3/25) developed skin sensitivity on the neck which later spread to back, torso, and legs.  Skin sensitivity persists still one week after onset, is a severe chafing feeling when skin comes into contact with clothing.  No rash or any visual signs.  Along with the skin sensitivity, mild to moderate chills from day to day as well as muscle fatigue and upper/lower back pain.  Symptoms varied in severity day to day; used ibuprofen and it seemed to offer limited, temporary relief.  Concurrent with second onset of symptoms, noticed gradual abdominal inflammation and developed sensation similar to UTI but urine dip and lab test results were all normal.  Doctor concluded immune reaction to vaccine as no other allergies or changes in routine as well as no prior medical history of any of these symptoms. Prescribed daily prednisone for three days to calm immune response; after one day symptoms were greatly improved.  Abdominal inflammation has improved and UTI sensation improved.  Still experiencing slight chills and skin sensitivity unchanged.

I couldn&#39;t sleep well because I got the chills and a fever. I went to use the bathroom around 3am. All of a sudden I got really nauseous, the room spun, everything went black and I fainted in the middle of my bathroom. My wife woke up and helped me back to bed. The next day I was very weak and tired. The chills and fever faded the next afternoon.

                                                Approximately seven minutes after the patient received the Janssen COVID vaccine, he had called out to his wife/pharmacy technician at the pharmacy stating he did not feel well.  His head had fallen back and his eyes were starting to roll back into his head. Patient had saliva starting to foam at the corner of his mouth and it appeared to be the onset of a mild seizure (per wife, patient has had seizure once before after a head injury) and he was turning very pale. Patient seemed to be unresponsive at that time - not answering to questions. At this point, one of the pharmacists ran to the clinic to get help and the other pharmacist administered an Epi-pen to patient&#39;s thigh.  Patient immediately came around after the injection, looked up and began talking. Staff called 911 and patient was monitored by pharmacy and clinic staff.  When the paramedics arrived, the patient was doing better and was able to ride home with his wife.

I took three ibuprofen at about 4am. Now I feel fine. Maybe just a little tired. But that could be from sleeping poorly last night.

At about 10:30pm I started feeling sick, fever of 99.6, muscle and joint pain, chills, dizziness, weakness. Left arm where I got injected also felt like it was falling asleep at some point when it shouldn&#39;t have been based on how I was positioned. I finally took an ibuprofen so I could sleep around 2:30am, and felt better a couple hours later or so. Today so far I feel fine but my resting heart rate is about 30 beats higher than normal so I&#39;m still responding to vaccine.  I think overall my symptoms aren&#39;t out of the ordinary, just way stronger than I was expecting. I felt miserable.

The last time I experienced symptoms like this was on the first day I started chemotherapy and had an allergic reaction to one of the chemo drugs (bleomycin). I had a delayed reaction hours later and went to the ER. It was determined it was an allergy. So I took Claritin D 24 H and saw the symptoms I was experiencing last night dissipate.

                                                Patient received Janssen vaccine was told to sit for 15 minutes post observation. He came up shortly after (less than 5 mins post imz) saying he didn&#39;t feel well, like he was going to pass out. I immediately came from the pharmacy, my tech sat a chair behind him. I called for optical to call a code white. The patient requested to sit on the ground. At this point, his wife was present. He was sweating. I gave him an ice pack, a water after it was determined he was breathing okay. He was pale, extremely lethargic and sweating. After sitting him on floor I told my tech to call 911. I took his blood pressure, it was 99/73, pulse 75. Very low for him. Hes on blood pressure medicine but been having issues controlling it. He later tells me hes terrified of needles. He also tells his wife he hadn&#39;t eaten all day. I stayed with the patient until ems left with him because when standing his heart rate dropped 20 points, after they stuck him again to check his blood sugar. They determined then he should be checked out at the hospital and they took him.

                                                I had the vaccine at 4:00 PM. I woke up at 12:05 AM with severe chills that turned into uncontrollable shaking for the next hour and twenty minutes. The shaking stopped at that time and my temperature went from 101.1 to 102.5. My skin was warm and I began to be very clammy. Around 3:45 AM, the fever broke and I was down to 99.5. I?ve subsequently had muscle aches and the feeling of being fatigued.

By 9 pm I was alternating between hot and cold sweats.  By 10 pm I was vomiting and defeating uncontrollably while still alternating between hot and cold sweats. I dry heaved until around 3 am and then finally passed out. My fever never exceeded right about 100 degrees. For the next 2 days I was incredibly exhausted with muscle aches and a minor headache. I didn?t return to baseline for approximately 6 days after the shot.

These subsided, and I developed a cough for the next 3 or 4 days. This developed into more of a chesty feeling and lethargic feeling. On the 8th day after my vaccine, my symptoms were similar to those in Covid positive cases; chest tightness, dry cough, and chills. I went to get tested, and was found to be Covid-19 positive. Since then, I have experienced severe headaches, continued tight chest, cough, chills, and sweats.

                                                After the initial 12 hour period, I experienced night-time chills followed then by being too warm and night sweats.  This happened both the first and second night.  During the day I was taking Tylenol every 6 hours for aches and pain.  Mainly my neck and back have been what hurts, although my knees, elbows, hips, etc. also were achy.  The third and fourth days I still continued to have chills, no fever throughout as far as I am aware (took my temp 2-3 times).  The fourth day I was very faint and somewhat unbalanced, felt shaky and light headed and I ended up having an anxiety attack.  I mention the last symptom as I have never had an episode like this previously in my life.  Today is day 5, still feel tired, slightly nauseous, neck and back pain, headache, difficulty focusing.

Vaccinator was notified that he has a history of vasovagal response with needles. This response presents itself as sweating (and possible fainting) and is alleviated by lying down. Client mentioned that previous nurse advised him to smell an alcohol pad to distract and prevent a vasovagal response, as this had worked previously on a glucose check. No medications were disclosed or history of anaphylaxis reported. With this background information, RN offered to have vaccine administered in reclined position, however client refused. RN conferred with co-lead about administration recommendations. Vaccinator then checked in with patient at 1423 to see if patient was okay and patient did not answer the question. RN then felt the client&#39;s hand and noticed hand was clammy. At 1425 the reclining chair was brought to the station and patient was transferred into chair, appearing diaphoretic. RN palpated pulse and noted patient was not tachycardia, but RN did note tachypnea and uneasiness. RN then provided distraction and promoted relaxation. Then at 1426 patient reported feeling okay and RN noted patient no longer felt clammy. At 1440 patient was asked if he would prefer if EMS should be called, patient declined and stated that he was able to drive home. Then at 1447 patient left the site appearing well, alert and oriented x3 leaving by self in private car.

                                                Had a sudden onset fever which reached 103 the evening of the injection.  There was muscle soreness, fatigue, my pulse was above 80 all night and reached 100 during the peak of the fever.  By the next morning, the fever had dropped to 100, fatigue remained and a slight headache appeared.  The headache was gone by noon, the fatigue remained all day.  The evening after the injection, a slight fever returned and then stopped.  Two days after the injection, there were no further averse reactions other than slight soreness in the injection site.  I am no longer fatigued and feel fine.  Hope this information helps.

Within about 5-10 minutes his girlfriend comes to the pharmacy window and tells me he&#39;s feeling bad.  By the time I get to his chair he is very lethargic and slumped over.  I sit him up in the chair and his head rolls back and his eyes have rolled back in his head.   I place him on the floor and instructed my staff to call 911.   The patient presented with sweats and was unresponsive for about 10-20 seconds.   When he came to he asked how he got on the floor.   The patient never had any trouble breathing  heart rate was steady the entire time.   When EMS arrived they checked him out and was fine.  He refused transport to the hospital.

At that point, started getting chills, which progressed into mix of chills and hot spells, fever, headache, and frequent urination throughout the night (though was also hydrating a lot).  Had fever the next morning still and Diarrhea.  Still feel modest headache and chills the next evening (before bed where I had felt the worst overnight the first night of the vaccine) but feeling better than the first night.  Per the form I received, I was told to include Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA in this section of the form.  I am reporting this on the day after the vaccination, so don&#39;t yet know final outcome, but again, improving and don&#39;t feel like I need medical attention.

Immediately sat back down to place my head between my knees, and completely blacked out, fallout out of the chair and hitting my head and knee on the floor and  nearby fixtures. Regained consciousness on floor about 30 seconds after fainting and immediately felt much better. Pharmacy staff were on hand and promptly called 911, instructed me not to move and took my pulse and monitored me until EMS arrived within 5-10 minutes. Vital signs normal including BP 120/90, 100% o2 levels, normal blood sugar and EKG. EMS assisted in getting me back to seated position and monitored for another 10-15 minutes. Declined transport and had family member drive me home where I rested for a few hours and woke up feeling fine. Very minor bruising / bump on head with no lasting sign of concussion or other trauma. 24&#43; hours post vaccine no other notable vaccine reactions aside from sore arm / muscles on injection site.

Wife was hot while I was freezing and shivering uncontrollably, so I know something was wrong with me.  The shivering and chills lasted for a couple of hours until about 2:30-3:00am.  Then I got really hot.  Took my temperature, was at 99.1 degrees.  But room was really warm so I turned down the temperature and took off my layers of clothing.  Woke up this morning, around 7am, to a headache and aching legs.  I took 2 Excederin, but the headache is still there.  Legs are feeling better after a couple of hours.

                                                About five hours after I received the vaccine I began to run a fever that averaged 102 degrees fahrenheit. At that time I also developed chills and extreme fatigue. These symptoms persisted until I fell asleep at 10:00 PM 3/13/21.  I was awakened at 1:00 AM with severe muscle spasms in my left bicep and a fever of 102.5 I started taking tylenol to begin reducing the fever. I also lost my appetite around that time. Things were pretty much the same all day 3/14/21. I went to sleep at 10:00 PM I got up every four hours to take tylenol. I woke up at 7:00 AM 3/15/21 to prepare for work my bed sheets and shirt were soaked with sweat but my fever was gone. I ate breakfast and drank a cup of coffee. When I got to work I begin having stomach problems.  When I started working I noticed that I was having a lot of trouble concentrating. I decided to leave early to go home and rest. Things have improved since then but I do have a headache that won&#39;t go away.

                                                Really bad hurting in chest pain, swollen lips and a headache. Had to go to ER.  Forgot to mention the vaccine shot. They finally decided it was an allergic reaction. Gave a steroid shot and Benadryl. Sent home on steroids for 5 days. The next day had rash and itching. The next day it was worse looked like lace pattern rash over most of his body and really bad itching. Like this through the 20th then he took Claritin and put on anti -itch cream. The next  day the rash had mostly cleared but still a little itchy. Today the 22 I have had a really bad headache.

Within a half an hour I had a 102.5 fever. After 2 hours the chills had dissipated but my fever was at 103.5. I took acetaminophen and slept fitfully all night. The next morning at 6:00 my fever was still 102 and I felt weak. By mid morning the fever was finally gone and I was exhausted and mildly nauseous for the rest of the day.

Took 2 Advil which did not seem to help much. Could not sleep all night and held cold pack on head to try to help headache. At 4:00 am was due to take 2 more Advil, and that finally seemed to help so he finally stopped having chills and could sleep. Woke up in the morning tired, but feeling better, symptoms pretty much gone.

                                                The 46yo patient came in to get his covid vaccine.  His parents reported he has a medical condition/disability that requires him to receive services in their home.  After receiving the vaccine the patient reported feeling lightheaded, dizzy, hot, and that his blood pressure felt abnormal.  He requested an ambulance and some water.  I called 911 and provided him water, but did not administer any epinephrine or any other medications.  The paramedics arrived and talked to him for about 15 minutes.  He then left on his own accord with his parents and declined further medical attention.

At 15 minutes asked nurse if normal. Then started sweating. left hand turned purple. Dont really remember anything else. Went unconscious. Remember them yelling Code something and Cardiac arrest. Taken to ER. Think they may have said anaphalatic shock. I think they gave me epinepherine. Had paralysis in left hand when i woke up for a few minutes. Blood work and EKG were normal. Went home within a couple of hours. Light-headed two days later still. Saw doctor two days after. Blood pressure is high.  Little bit of fatigue and brain fog.

My body was cold. I had a pretty severe headache as well.  My body ached all over. Muscle and joint pain. I took Tylenol, but it didn&#39;t seem to do much. I spent all day Saturday in bed or on the couch. I ran a fever of 100.9 to 101.6 all day Saturday. My body ached making it hard to go up or down stairs. I was weak feeling and I was exhausted just going to refrigerator to get juice or water. Not much of an appetite all day. Also, arm was sore and bruised at the shot location. That was the least of my issues. Today is Sunday and I am feeling better now. I feel like the worst is absolutely behind me, but I felt so terrible yesterday, I thought I should report my issues.

He remained in the IMZ room for observation and applied a cool compress to forehead and back of neck.  Coloring came back after about 10-15 minutes and he said he felt better.  Also mentioned that this happened to him after he got a TDap vaccine about 15 years ago - he said it is a mental thing with him and does not like to get vaccines.

This continued for about 3-3.5 weeks. On the night of Apr 16, he went to bed early not feeling well. Next morning he complained of heaviness in the chest area. We immediately consulted Dr., and mentioned that he got the vaccine. Dr. advised us to immediately go to an Emergency Room. Patient was found to be having a heart attack. His right artery was 100% blocked. The 3 left arteries had no blockage at all. Angioplasty was done and he had a stent placed in right artery. The clot was removed as part of angioplasty. He now needs to be on blood thinners for life.

Fever ultimately broke and temp was normal when I woke up this morning.  Just tired and head-achy now likely from poor nights sleep.  Temps were taken with an oral, digital read thermometer.  I will follow up if fever continues.

                                                Day 1: Saturday morning March 6 at 5:00am I was shaken out of my sleep with a nasty migraine, sour stomach, intense body aches, stuffy nose, fever (102f). Classic flu like symptoms. I was extremely sick all day Saturday (level of sick: 8/10). Day 2: Sunday morning March 7 I awoke again extremely sick, just as sick as Saturday. All same symptoms (level of sick: 7/10). Sunday night I was incredibly miserable, all flu symptoms, I did not sleep Sunday night, up all night and up all day the next day Monday. Day 3: Monday I continued to be sick, all same symptoms, all day long. This time the blood shot eyes &amp; bloody nose came on, fever was steady at 101f (level of sick: 6/10). Day 4: Tuesday woke up still stick, same flu like symptoms. I feel the headache has gotten worse, in fact way worse. Fever steady at 101f all day. Overall I&#39;m not as sick except the headache and fever (level of sick: 6/10).  Day 5: Wednesday I was really hoping I&#39;d make a full recovery but still still sick, fever dropped for a few hours then came back, fever peaks and bounces around at 101f. Headache is absolutely nasty, I feel intense pain in the back of my neck and head, hard to sleep or lay down. (level of sick: 5/10). Day 6: Thursday I feel like I&#39;m just about kick this sickness, feeling way better. I dont have a fever today but I still have an incredibly nasty headache, really intense, my eyes hurt, back of my neck hurts. (level of sick: 3/10). Day 7: Friday, no flu symptoms, finally!! But the headache continues, really bad. It sort of disables my ability to function with the headache. Back of my neck and back of head hurts, inside my brain hurts. Ugh! Day 8: Saturday, no flu, no fever, although still bad headache. I&#39;ve been taking Advil all week to help reduce the headache. It helps, but after about 6 hours later the headache returns. Late in the evening Saturday my head was pounding. Day 9: Sunday headache not that bad, mild headache lingered throughout the day, tolerable. Day 10: Monday no headache!! Today was the first full day of full happiness!! *NOTE*: In July 2020 I got COVID extremely bad, spent 4 days in the ICU, couldnt breathe!! I had a fever of 103 for 6 days straight before calling 911 to come and get me. I was in bad shape, lost 30 lbs, had respiratory breathing issue for about 2 months after hospital stay. Most sick I&#39;ve ever been, total game changer, I will never be the same. To this day I feel my respiratory is at 90%, fatigue still comes around every so often. --- Thank you ---

The next morning at 4:45 am I woke with chills and moderate muscle , joint aches and random sharp muscle pains all over my hips, arms, and legs. Chills, aches, and fever continued until 8:30pm the same night. My fever would go to 102.8 as a high to 100.2 depending on how close I was to my next timeframe to take Tylenol.  I took 4 extra strength Tylenol (2000 mg) every 4 hours, give or take 30 minutes. Around 8:30 pm my fever broke and I sweated mildly Until around 10:30pm

                                                Day 1: Saturday morning March 6 at 5:00am I was shaken out of my sleep with a nasty migraine, sour stomach, intense body aches, stuffy nose, fever (102f). Classic flu like symptoms. I was extremely sick all day Saturday (level of sick: 8/10). Day 2: Sunday morning March 7 I awoke again extremely sick, just as sick as Saturday. All same symptoms (level of sick: 7/10). Sunday night I was incredibly miserable, all flu symptoms, I did not sleep Sunday night, up all night and up all day the next day Monday. Day 3: Monday I continued to be sick, all same symptoms, all day long. This time the blood shot eyes &amp; bloody nose came on, fever was steady at 101f (level of sick: 6/10). Day 4: Tuesday woke up still stick, same flu like symptoms. I feel the headache has gotten worse, in fact way worse. Fever steady at 101f all day. Overall I&#39;m not as sick except the headache and fever (level of sick: 6/10).  Day 5: Wednesday I was really hoping I&#39;d make a full recovery but still still sick, fever dropped for a few hours then came back, fever peaks and bounces around at 101f. Headache is absolutely nasty, I feel intense pain in the back of my neck and head, hard to sleep or lay down. (level of sick: 5/10). Day 6: Thursday I feel like I&#39;m just about kick this sickness, feeling way better. I dont have a fever today but I still have an incredibly nasty headache, really intense, my eyes hurt, back of my neck hurts. (level of sick: 3/10). Day 7: Friday, no flu symptoms, finally!! But the headache continues, really bad. It sort of disables my ability to function with the headache. Back of my neck and back of head hurts, inside my brain hurts. Ugh! Day 8: Saturday, no flu, no fever, although still bad headache. I&#39;ve been taking Advil all week to help reduce the headache. It helps, but after about 6 hours later the headache returns. Late in the evening Saturday my head was pounding. Day 9: Sunday headache not that bad, mild headache lingered throughout the day, tolerable. Day 10: Monday no headache!! Today was the first full day of full happiness!! *NOTE*: In July 2020 I got COVID extremely bad, spent 4 days in the ICU, couldnt breathe!! I had a fever of 103 for 6 days straight before calling 911 to come and get me. I was in bad shape, lost 30 lbs, had respiratory breathing issue for about 2 months after hospital stay. Most sick I&#39;ve ever been, total game changer, I will never be the same. To this day I feel my respiratory is at 90%, fatigue still comes around every so often.

                                                Runny nose started maybe an hour or so after injection.  Felt slight nausea around 6:30PM until I went to bed. Woke up at about 1:30AM with mild nausea. Within about 30 minutes I experienced chills.  I hydrated and tried to go back to sleep.  In the morning I had a fever of 100.3 degrees.  Took 1000 mg of Tylenol and hydrated, another 500 mg 4 hours later. Chills came on and off throughout the day.   Added layers of clothing to stop the chills. Ate breakfast and lunch. Drank G2 to hydrate. Temp bounced between 99.6 and 100.8 throughout the day.  Experienced heartburn for several hours in the afternoon. Took a  nap at 3:30 for 2 hours, ate, rehydrated and removed some layers to clothing and put on a cool towel on my forehead to try to reduce.  Took 1000 mg of Tylenol and went to  bed. Slept well. All symptoms were gone by morning.

His headache was getting worse.  All symptoms were getting better except the headache.  He thought he was feeling better but when he woke up today 4/6/2021 he was SOB and diarrhea was back. Pt has taken Pepto Bismol for his symptoms and will probably need to go to the ER since he is having trouble breathing.   He feels like he has had such a bad reaction to this since he possibly has had the covid vax in the past 90 days.

Sepsis with unknown source of infection:  This is evidenced by leukopenia, tachycardia and fever. Acute metabolic encephalopathy, likely secondary to possible sepsis versus effects of  COVID vaccine. Encephalitis and meningitis ruled out. Acute nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis: evidenced by elevated CK levels 1700 on admission, likely secondary to sepsis. Acute renal failure, hypothyroidism, transaminitis, elevated troponin likely associated with rhabdo. On sepsis protocol (vancomycin, meropenem and acyclovir)  Disc

I did not measure my body temperature because I immediately ran under the blanket. Icy-cold hands and feet, even after my body temperature seemed to stabilize. I fell asleep but not a restful sleep. I woke up after 2.5 to 3 hours with the feeling that it was morning, but in fact it was between 2am and 3 am. At that point I felt the worst part had gone, I felt weak and with muscle aches but I could drink water and go back to bed. I did not have a restful sleep all night and I woke up may times. By the morning I was tired but no fever.

                                                Dizziness start on Sunday,  3/21/2021 and has been present every day since so far. This is abnormal for me. Prior to that, I have been having some problems breathing after getting the vaccine and have been using my Ventolin  more often after the vaccine. Also noticed shortly after getting the vaccine, a feeling of liquid in my right ear.  the liquid in the ear did go away a day before the dizziness started.  Did not consider the ear or breathing issues as possible side effects  as I do have asthma and figured the ear was congestion. Not sure if the dizziness and the feeling of liquid in my right ear are related and/or related to the vaccine.

By the 2nd night  I had a headache that was unbelievable.  I eventually took Tylenol 48 hrs after the shot and it barely helped the headache. I never ever get sick never have headaches. It was bad. I was also super super irritable and I am generally a happy person. I was so bothered by everyone I was sorta angry at them it was weird. By Sunday night my headache was even worse so bad in my neck on my left side that I had the shot, I could barely move my head. I took Tylenol recommended dose. I finally fell asleep on Sunday night 3 days later midnight sweaty again.   Monday morning I woke up and I never felt better. On top of the world amazing.  I felt not  just good but extra good. Ready to go for it all.  It was a very strange experience for over three days. I typically get the flu shot, I stay healthy and never had an experience like this, I don?t get sick luckily. Any I wanted to share this because it was so strange and no one warned me really. .  I have felt great since and am thankful I had the shot.

                                                About 20 hours after injection, I had mild flu-like symptoms, including headache and muscle ache, lasting about 12 hours. But about 5 days after my injection (5 days &#43; 5 hours, actually), I experienced a bewildering all-over rash that freaked me out. It started as itching around my elbows and ankles -- it felt like mosquito bites and sunburn together -- and spread to wrist and knee areas. The rash climbed by legs and arms. I applied coat after coat of Benadryl, which seemed to help. The rash would disappear and move somewhere else. I had it on my left foot, but then that resolved, only to find it on my right foot. After about 3 hours, it had spread to my stomach, the bridge of my nose, and my cheeks. It started to calm down around midnight. I woke up at 6:00 am (12 hours after onset) with extremely itchy hands. At 8:00 am (14 hours after onset), it had mostly disappeared except for patches on my back, and my wrists still itch. I&#39;m hoping it goes away later today! It was crazy!

                                                Dizziness started around the second day after receiving the vaccine.  Today is the 4th day after and I am still having bouts of dizziness.  It&#39;s not enough that I need to sit down, although it is somewhat disorienting.

Physically felt as if temperature was elevated--but when measured, no temperature elevation was found.  Symptoms lasted entire day, were gone the following day.  Two days after vaccination (19/MAR/2021)--injection site soreness.  Note that site was not at all sore on either date of injection (17/MAR/2021), or day after.  Soreness lasted approximately two days.

                                                First, pain around the injection site; it appeared within a few hours after the injection, but it was bearable.  Then, after about 23 hours after the injection, bad headache (especially around the eyes - which also caused light sensitivity) and general malaise. Shortly thereafter, low-grade fever (99.5 F) and significant muscle pain, all over the body.  The most worrisome side effect was the last one, which appeared during the second night after the injection (about 32-33 hours after the injection): extremely fast heartbeat / racing heart.   I did not use any treatments for these side effects.

                                                About 10 minutes after injection, got dizzy/clammy. It took about 5-10 minutes after that with EMTs to wait until my blood pressure normalized, and then I was fine.  Walked off site.  Slowly throughout the day had an increasingly bad headache, which peaked about 10 hours after the injection. Around that same time, bad fatigue started, and then slight chills. The headache at this point was extremely severe for about 10-12 hours. After that (so 20-22 hours after initial injection) the fatigue and chills subsided, but came back occasionally. The headache was less severe at that point, but in total did not go away until an additional 15 hours had passed.   My estimate is that took about 36-40 hours to feel 100% normal again.

This lasted for several hours after... At 11:30pm, almost 7 hours after the shot, I started to feel lousy. I started to get body aches and chills. Within 30 minutes they were fairly intense body aches and chills, shaking. At 1:00am I started to feel nauseas . At 1:30 am I started dry heaving. At approximately 2:30 I threw up twice, and the dry heaving and nausea lasting until 4am , when I took an anti nausea pill. I finally fell asleep at 430am. I woke up at 8am and felt tired, and no longer nauseated.

My shoulder is still stiff on the opposite side of the injection site at this time.  My doctor told me it might be sinus pressure and he put me on some steroids - had a five day dose and I finished them.

After use of benadryl the hives became more red, less raised, and resembled a confluent measles rash. From association with hives I experienced ear pruritus, sore throat, nausea. And fatigue. Hydrocortisone creme was used on the rash.

                                                I received the J&amp;J vaccine on 3/24, and by that evening I had a headache, and my tinnitus was louder than normal. I had mild barely perceptible tinnitus prior to the vaccine. I would normally never notice it during the day, but lying down and going to sleep in a quiet room I would hear it. Constant high pitch but not loud, in the background more. I always run a fan in my bedroom so that I have some white noise and don&#39;t hear it. I had the flu like headache from the vaccine for two days and then it slowly started to subside into the weekend. I was tired as well from the immune response.  Five days out, I get out of the shower in the morning, and go to put underarm deodorant on, and notice my left armpit is all bright red. I check my right armpit, just as red.. Took photos of the red armpits and shared with some family and friends, as I read on the Internet that there were all kinds of crazy side effects that were possible. The red skin like rash is one of them, although my armpits never itched or burned. I could feel that they were warmer than normal, that was it. It was the 2nd day after my red armpits that my tinnitus ratcheted up to the current level that I am really unhappy with. The red armpits went away within 48 hours, never did anything about the redness, just didn&#39;t put underarm deodorant on until it passed. Sadly, the Tinnitus has remained and it is at a level that is distracting and persistent.

Went to bed at my usual time and woke up at 2:00 am with the chills I could not get warm late that night around 5:00 am I started having joint pain and fatigue with a headache and hot skin. I had taken my temperature and it was 100.7. I tried to wait out symptoms but I seem to bee get worse throughout the morning. Around 10:00 am I was in terrible pain and my body hurt all over. I once again took my temperature and it had gone up to 101.9. I had to call of work because I was so ?out of it?.  I started taking Tylenol ever 4 hrs for my fever and I was trying to hydrate.  My temperature slowly went down but still had body pain. I then started thank ibuprofen to help. Later that night around 9:00 pm my temperature was 99. The next day I called off work for fatigue and body pain. Today my temperature is normal and I?m starting to feel like my self again

                                                Patient had arm tingling shortly after injection. Pt stayed in store for about 4 hours after 2pm injection, no redness or swelling noticed. Pt was quite anxious &amp; nervous (but already has severe anxiety). Pharmacist called patient following afternoon, the 11th and patient noted he was doing marginally better but still sounded anxious. Pharmacist called patient on Fri the 12th 5:16p and this was when the patient explained the following: Muscle stiffness on left side &amp; pain down left leg; cranial pain; shoulder stiffness; nasal congestion; some shortness of breath; soreness &amp; fatigue.  Patient called back and said he had partial shortness of breath at 7:34p on the 12th.  On Sat the 13th at 11am, pharmacist called to check on pt; found him quite agitated &amp; saying, &#34;He feels the shot was botched&#34;, noted he had called Janssen to report his issues.  At 4:30pm, pt came to pharmacy, looked fine, arm showed no redness, was more subdued in person than on the phone earlier. He said he was feeling better but was not happy with Janssen and wanted the Moderna 2 series shot because he feels Janssen&#39;s vaccine wasn&#39;t doing what it was supposed to.

                                                Chills on the same day starting approximately 9 hours after vaccine injection.  Little to no sleep that same night.  Very restless, tossing and turning, not tired - very awake (which is unusual).  Next morning, arose at 5am with moderate chills, moderate all over body aches, and moderate headache - very symptomatic of the regular flu.   Felt bad enough to call out of work.  As of this moment, roughly 33 hours later, it seems to be subsiding, but unsure if that&#39;s just the Advil. * Note:  Vaccine is &#34;Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Lot # 1805031 administered.

                                                Began feeling dizzy and nauseated.   Started vomiting at approximately 5:00pm and continued until 6:30 or 7:00pm. I could not open my eyes because of the extreme dizziness. Chills Sweating I was able to sleep for a few hours and woke up at 10:00pm and the symptoms had subsided. I woke up with a headache on Sunday morning.  That went away and have not had any symptoms since

                                                Initial symptoms began with pain at the injection site and generalized fatigue.  This developed into soft tissue pain in proximity of the large and small joints which could be elicited further on palpation.  I had eye pain (left more severe than the right) which could be further elicited on palpation, headache, dizziness, chills, and an inability to feel warm.  There was also significant skin sensitivity over the trunk, scalp, and upper extremities and more in the left arm than the right.  The symptoms persisted over the second day albeit at less severity.  Presently on the third day, I am experiencing continued eye pain, mainly in the left eye and mild dizziness.

I gave him 2 Extra strength Acetaminophen (500 mg each).  At 7:15 pm his fever had risen to 105.8.  At that time, I gave him 2 Advil (200mg. each).  By 8:00 pm his fever started to break and was 102 degrees.  I continued to alternate Acetaminophen and Advil every few hours.  By the morning of 3/13/21 his fever was back to normal.  He was left feeling extremely tired and had a terrific headache. By Monday, March 15 he was feeling much better.

We quickly checked his temperature however it was within normal range. We applied cold packs to his wrists, forehead, and face for about 12 minutes. I checked for normal capillary refill and asked him questions to assess his mental status. About 20 minutes after starting the treatment, patient started improving. He returned almost back to normal in about 30 minutes.

Patient was directed to sit in waiting area for 15 minutes for monitoring; during this time, patient started to complain of the following: chest/abdominal pain, &#34;pounding in his head&#34;, felt faint, and &#34;scratchy throat&#34; that was not improving. Around 3:35pm, 9-1-1 was called due to worsening chest pain and scratchy throat. EMTs directed me to administer 25mg of diphenhydramine (which as give at 3:46pm) to patient. EMTs arrived shortly thereafter, noting elevated BP (~154/90). Patient left pharmacy area ~4:10pm and was brought to ER via paramedics for further evaluation.

It has not gone away. It has grown about a centimeter more in diameter over the past 2 weeks. I noticed I have been coughing a lot and I have been having to use my inhaler and I have congestion. I don&#39;t know if its seasonal allergies or due to the shot. I have had to use my inhaler which I NEVER do. It is Ventolin.

                                                Lightheaded about 5 minutes after injection. Medical team took HR and BP and was normal Took about 20 minutes and light headedness went away  Later that night at around 12:30 am, felt very cold and shivering with severe headache Did not take temperature Had a hard time going back to sleep Got up around 1:00 am to take 800 mg of OTC Advil When walking back up stairs had severe muscle pain in arms and legs Was fine after that Seemed to get better by 2 am No issues next day  About 7-10 days later developed severe frontal headaches/sinus pressure No other symptoms Used Neti Pot with saline solution and did nothing Took OTC allergy meds and Advil and did nothing  Say my primary care Dr and he prescribed Flonase, Singular and Allegra &#43; continue Neti Pot and Advil as needed Not much improvement on this regime after 3-5 days of use  About a week later developed severe pain in bottom right jaw Took OTC Advil and again no improvement Went to Dentist and said not tooth related but probably TMJD Recommend dental appliance to help with grinding  About a few days later after this jaw pain developed, developed sharp stabbing pain in bottom of left knee cap. No recollection of any insult that would cause this  All three of these pain sites were perfectly fine prior to getting J&amp;J vaccine.  No history of pain or injury to these areas prior  All of these incidents to me seem to be inflammatory/immune in nature and could be related to J&amp;J vaccine based upon how I reacted to injection.  Curious if others are seeing the same thing and if so what should be done or how long should this last?

                                                Patient was scheduled for an appointment for a Johnson &amp;Johnson  covid-19 vaccine through a drive thru Thursday April 8, 2021 @12:45pm. We arrived early and he received the vaccine at 12:15pm, waited 30 minutes for reaction and he was feeling fine. Later that same evening, the patient was driving to work on the freeway when he felt a dry throat so he coughed hard, at that cough he felt a massive pain in his head, like his &#34;head was going to explode.&#34; He immediately had tunnel vision closing in on him, so he pulled over and later woke up in our parked car with flashing emergency lights on, parked on the shoulder of the freeway. Disoriented and confused why he was there, he looked at his watch and saw he lost 15 minutes when he had passed out. MY HUSBAND COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED IF HE HAD NOT PULLED HIMSELF OVER WHEN PASSING OUT. Today we reported this to our doctors office and to you!

Went to bed at approx 11:00 PM wearing all my clothes and under a quilt and two wool blankets.  Chills continued, but then I also began sweating profusely.   I did not rest well and was up approx every hour drinking water and urinating.  I noticed an elevated heart rate for several hours through the night.   cont&#39;d below

Stayed home Monday because I could, but by noon felt nearly 100%, by 6pm felt 100%.

                                                I had no noticed issues for about 18 hours after the injection Tuesday evening.  Sometime early Wednesday afternoon I began to experience body aches, a low-grade fever, and extreme tiredness.  I slept most of the rest of the day and night and felt better when I woke up Thursday morning, well enough to go about a normal day.  It is now late Thursday afternoon and I am still a little tired and mildly achy with no fever but otherwise much improved.    One other thing to report, initially there was no pain or tenderness to the injection site but that started changing about 24 hours after the injection.  Now about 46 hours after injection the site has a constant noticeable soreness even if I am not moving my arm.

                                                Patient arrived for COVID vaccine prior to working shift. He stated upon questioning having an anaphylactic reaction to seafood. We requested him to stay in observation for 30 minutes after vaccine administration. He agreed and vaccine was administered. After working  approximately 3 hours later he returned to the pharmacy stating he felt out of breath. He didn&#39;t know if it was because of vaccine or CHF. Questioning him further, he said he felt a little swollen around neck. He was responsive. Administered 50mg of Benadryl. Instructed him to sit. He had a portable fan. After sitting down, he started to feel better. He remained at the pharmacy and called for transportation home, leaving approximately 1 hour later

This happened before 25 years ago and is likely unrelated to the vaccine. Expected cold/flu-like symptoms did occur on March 14 and part of March 15 but things have been fine since then. I&#39;ve followed up with my GCP and am scheduling a Neuro appointment for followup.

                                                I just thought I should report two changes I have noticed in my body since being vaccinated, the first being about a dozen small pimples on my forehead, which is weird for me, but were evident for several days that week after the vaccine; and I have been very dizzy when I get up in the  middle of the night to go to the bathroom, bumping into the wall, which is uncommon for me.  I also teach at a community college and I noticed that I get dizzy when I turn to go to the board and sometimes have had to put my hand out to steady myself against the board before writing on it.  Not major disruptions, but strange to me.  I don&#39;t take much in the way of medications, ever.  I might take an aspirin once in a while, but I don&#39;t take any regular meds or have any other health issues.  Just wanted to put this on the record.  Thank you.

By 9a.m. my blood pressure taken at home was 180/110 and started having chest pain on left side.    Went to urgent care where they felt it was a cardiac reaction to vaccine and they sent me to ER.   Underwent EKG and chest xray.   Blood pressure still at same level 180/110 and not going down, migraine still at an 8 out of 10, chest pain still present.    I was given an IV to treat for migraine pain and within a few hours all symptoms had went away.   We started with Urgent Care at about 10a.m. on 4/3/21 and then by the time all was done I was released from the ER at 6:30p.m. on 4/3/21.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination I started to experience chronic exhaustion, leg cramping and pain in my lower back right side, upper right thigh, behind my right knee and down into my right calf. I figured that the pain would go away but the pain increased and my leg started swelling and the pain increased making it very difficult for me to put my leg down on the ground and put pressure on my right leg.

Next day high temp continued topping out @ 105.7 degrees with a resting heart rate of 96 (normal is high 50&#39;s to low 60&#39;s).  General sense of malaise, no energy.  Stayed hydrated all day, took 600 mg Advil @ 7:30 a.m., followed  1,300 mg of Tylenol @ 5;30 p.m.  Hi temp continued, took add&#39;l 1,300 mg Tylenol &amp; 800 mg Advil @ 8:30 p.m. and temp finally dropped to 102 degrees.  Slept pretty soundly Saturday night and feel much better on Sunday but still not 100%.  Took temp @ 5:30 p.m. today and temp back up to 103;5 degrees.  Took 600 mg Advil &amp; 1,300 mg of Tylenol.

                                                About 9:00 PM got chills. Finally broke around midnight and after that was hot and achy. Today body aches, head ache, and eyes hurt. This is a similar reaction to what I have with the flu vaccine. I no longer get the flu vaccine because of this.

                                                Around 7:00 P.M. on March 12, 2021 approximately 9 hours after receiving the Jansen COVD-19 vaccine in my left arm. I developed extreme fatigue, muscle aches, skin hurt to the touch of anything including clothing, headache, and fever 101.5.  I had to go to bed and was very weak.  I took ibuprofen and Tylenol for the discomfort.  I slept 14 hours and was able to get up at 11:00 A.M. on March 13, 2021.  The soreness at the site of the injection is not problematic.  There were other odd symptoms overnight I would awake with strange nerve like sensations tingling and itching that occurred on the bottom of the left foot, upper lip, and neck.  I also had several episodes of restlessness that was so bad that I had to stand for a few minutes before being able to lay down again.  The worst is the skin hurting and headache.  I have also had a few dizzy episodes since getting out of bed this morning.  It passes if I sit down or hold onto something.  None of these symptoms are normal for me and I cannot remember having a reaction to any vaccinations that I have received in the past.  I hope this helps with your study.

About 10 hours later I started feeling sick.  One of the first things I noticed besides a headache was my heart rate jumped up to over 100 beats per minute (it is normally below 84).  I started getting chills and fever.  It was worse than any flu fever I ever had and I could not sleep.  Worst part was my heart rate would not go down, remaining above 100 but below 110-115 beats per minute.  I considered calling 911 but after looking online decided not to as long as it remained below 120 bpm.  I don&#39;t know my maximum temperature - I did not think to take it until after the peak had passed by 20 minutes or so (was 99.4 at that point - normal temperature runs 97.2 (low 96.8, high 98.2)).  Heart rate finally started to drop around 3:30 am.

Sat outside in 85 degrees for awhile to try to warm up. About 9pm got in the walk-in shower and sat on bench super hot water. Got out of shower at 9:40pm my skin beet red mostly my chest. Still freezing and body aches. Put on sweatpants and long sleeve t-shirt. Now have A/C off and windows open, 82 degrees outside. My temp taken before I started this form was at 98.7. I ache all over and am freezing. Not shivering though. But have goosebumps on arms under sleeves. I am very uncomfortable. It is now 10:35pm.

He said he was dizzy. He was at this point dizzy, pale, sweating, low heart rate in the 30&#39;s. We put a cold wet rag on the back of his neck and monitored. We gave him some cold water also. Slowly over the next 5-10 minutes his stats got better, color returned, and was not sweating anymore. He did not feel dizzy anymore.  We monitored for an additional 30 minutes. Gave instructions. Sent home with spouse.

BP had gone down some, so they agreed to proceed. After dose, pt was dizzy, sweaty, unresponsive for a short time. Once he was more responsive, we helped him sit on the floor against the wall as he was quite dizzy. We called 911 and pt refused transport to hospital, but was evaluated.

He went home and  laid down and fell asleep.  When he woke up he called his PCP because he wasn&#39;t feeling well.  His heart rate was running from 80-90 and fluctuating like he was about to have a heart attack. He was told to call back if he wasn&#39;t feeling better.  On 4/9  his heart  was running about 90-115.  On 4/10 his heart was running from 139-142.  He called his doctors office and they told him to go to the ER.  He went to hospital.   He was given heart  EKG, labs  and IV.  He was given aspirin.  His INR was at 2.  His heart rate came down to 115.   His blood was low.  His DX was Sinus Tachycardia.  He was admitted to the Heart Floor.  He was treated for 2 days and released.  They told him they thought he was reacting to taking the vaccination and to FU w/ PCP.  He said his heart rate is fluctuating  and is currently at 101.  He doesn&#39;t see a Cardiologist since he cannot have open heart surgery due to his underlying health conditions.

When I got up at 10:30 to check and see if I had a fever, I measured it at 103.5 F.  I took 2 tylenol at 10:30 and at 130 am my fever was 102.5.  I just thought this was a larger reaction than what is typical, so I thought I would report it.   Additionally, this mass vaccination site had a number of adverse reactions (within 15 minutes of injection), so I thought I should report this to someone.   Disappointingly it is near impossible to talk to anyone on the phone these days to get or give information.  I called the VAERS phone number, but was on hold for 15 minutes and gave up.

He was sweating  and having shortness of breath. Pt. was taken to the seat where he fainted. Pt. was laid on the floor with his legs up in a step. He gained consciousness in less than 1 min.  Pt was pale. Pt. was given an alcohol swab to smell. 911 was called. First responders took his blood pressure again and blood sugar. Uncle&#39;s pt. was called and came to the Pharmacy to pick him up to avoid pt. having to drive his car back home.

                                                After the injection on Friday 03/12 at 1:50 PM at facility, I started to get a slight temperature, Along with chills as well. This continue throughout the weekend. I remained at home and did not have any energy to go out and be around people. The next day, I also got diarrhea and was very dehydrated.  Immediately, after I left the vaccine shot location, like within 5 minutes, I started to smell fish and my mouth tasted like salt for three days. I also had excruciating headaches that did not go away with advil. So I rested a  lot and had no real big appetite what so ever!.  Today, I am concerned that on my left side below my left clavicle, I feel a big bump what appears to be possibly a lymphatic swelling of node? I am concerned because I did not have this swelling before and do not know if it&#39;s a reaction to the vaccine.  Pls contact me via phone, this is urgent.  Thanks

About 13 hours after injection, I felt like I had a full blown case of the flu...fever, chills, sweats, light heaviness, body aches and general nausea.  Sleep was irregular.  Next day, symptoms subsided, but still had body aches and fatigue, and I called in sick for work.

After 48 hours from injection, headache is 90% improved. Took Advil, but that did nothing for headache.  It was the worst headache that I can ever remember having.  Extreme muscle pain in various parts of the body started at same time as onset of headache. This, too, died out as the headache got better.  Slight nausea on day #2.  No fever. Was steady at 96.6 throughout these adverse reactions.

                                                First 4 hours post injection no serious side effects, slight headache was settling in.  At approx. 8PM (7 hours after shot) I had fairly a severe reaction of horror for the next 16 hours - all night long.  Heart racing/energy beyond, deep chills and severe whole body shaking to the point of my back going out (dont&#39; have a bad back), fever, migraine headache so bad (i dont get headaches) and body aches from a horror movie.   I&#39;m a jock, run daily, healthy, no smoke, drink or drugs. This lasted all night long well into the morning. At 3Am i considered going to the ER, but didnt. By 2pm the following day most of it went away. Two days later (today) i am dizzy, heart feels fast or racing, naseuous earlier , and exhausted. I can deal with it now, but it&#39;s very uncomfortable. Frankly, I regret getting the vaccine, wish i had not.   I had covid last March, it was no big deal beyond what a flu would have done...with some shortness of breath on and off for a few months. The reaction to the vaccine is viccious compared to covid itself (for me, just my experience). Hope this all stops and goes away.   Thank you for your work!

                                                Approximately 4 minutes after the injection, while sitting down, I felt light headed, sweating, weak, face turned white. I was close to passing out but didn&#39;t. I requested attention after about 10 minutes. While being treated by medics they mentioned color had returned to my face. I felt better enough so I refused to go to hospital and was driven home. Later that morning, 03/08/2021 about 10 AM, I developed a fever and body aches with sharp pains thru out my body and joints. First temperature check was 100.5. My fever, pains/weakness increased thru out that day and overnight with chills. Highest temp check was 102.8 that evening prior to bedtime. I don&#39;t know if it could have been higher at some point overnight. It felt like I had a moderate to bad case of the FLU. The next morning, 03/09/2021 the fever broke down to about 101. By 03/11/2021, aside from a little residual weakness I felt more like myself. However, as of the writing of this report my temp seems to fluctuate between normal and 99.8. Will report this to my Doctor on next visit. Worth noting that I haven&#39;t had any Flu like symptoms to that degree in many years.

Intense muscle aches were later (approx 6-8 hrs after shot) along with overall fatigue.  A medium grade headache began 8-10 hrs after shot and continued throughout night - lowering to a slight headache within 24 hrs after shot.  Headache ended 28-30 hrs after shot.  Developed a post nasal drip and mild congestion in sinuses about 1.5 days after shot (and continues).  Numbness in toes appears to have returned with some stiffness felt in my calf muscles.

Around 9:00pm started to feel chills and tired with low grade fever (100 C). Around 1:30am started feeling right side back pain in my kidney area that woke me up. By 2:15am the pain was almost unbearable, and I could no longer lay in bed. At 3:00am I took 2x 500mg Tylenol as I debated whether to call my doctor or go straight to ER. By the 3:45am pain was subsiding and was I able to get back in bed by 4am. Today no pain.

                                                Shortly after leaving the facility, after waiting the required 15 minutes post vaccine, I was driving back home on the freeway when I suddenly felt light-headed and as though all the energy had left my body (as though I was about to pass out). Then, without warning, I passed out, while driving on the freeway. Fortunately, I did not hit anyone, or was hit by anyone, and must have bounced off guardrails after crossing traffic twice and going off the freeway into the middle of an off ramp, where I finally came to. I did not suffer any injuries in the accident.

It got progressively worse and spread to the front of my head too. By that evening (Sunday 3/9) it was throbbing like one of the worst headaches I have had. Monday was so bad that I  called in and didn&#39;t work. Tuesday 3/9 was still bad. Finally, Tuesday night is started letting up and was able to sleep. I still have a little headache at the back of my head, 9:00am 3/10.  Also, I couldn&#39;t sleep Sunday 3/8 and Monday 3/9 night .  I had a Tylenol 3 prescription and used it.  I was taking  2 at a time and it was not helping much.  Also mixed in some ibuprofen.

Starting about 10-14 days after receiving the vaccine (IM into my deltoid), I have been experiencing a regional (almost dermatomal) distribution itchiness and hypersensitivity in my left infrascapular and upper lateral back region. It&#39;s a superficial (dermal/epidermal) discomfort, not deep. I have observed NO associated rash or hives; nothing is visually evident. I am still experiencing this at day 19 post vaccine. I&#39;ve not taken any medication, have not applied any topicals, etc.

I did my daily physical exercise routine as usual ( lift weight 80 lbs), Went to clean my face and look the mirror, and I notice I have my LEFT EYE bloody AND RED. Second day is more. I am using eye drops to remove this problem.  Never had this situation happened before and I have never had any shot for 55 years.

I recommended Patient to stop bleeding by using tissue paper. After 30 minutes spoke to Patient and I was informed that bleeding stopped. He was still having moderate flu-like symptoms at the time of phone call.
