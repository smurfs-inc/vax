                                                Patient states on Friday, 4/9, he went to the pharmacy to receive his J&amp;J Covid-19 vaccine. He states on Saturday morning, his R nostril began to bleed, and continued to bleed until Monday. He states on Wednesday, 4/7, he noticed oral sores that at first were not painful, but large. He was worried about it interfering with his shot, but because he had waited so long to get it, he decided to proceed anyway. He denies any fever or chills, no frank diarrhea, but occasional loose stools, without blood seen. He denies HA, vision changes, or focal neuro deficits. On Sunday, 4/11, the patient ended up going to ED to evaluate his epistaxis, the MD attributed it to his elevated BP, the patient reports it being 160s/90s. They gave him new BP medications, which he took, but when he saw the Dr., he instructed the patient not to keep taking his BP meds. When asking the patient if anything correlates with foods he eats, the only thing he can pinpoint it to, would be pico de gallo. He states it has irritated his mouth before. He also reports recently taking his wife&#39;s supplement (unknown name) but thinks it is for cholesterol. He took that approximately 1 week ago. No new changes in food habits, mouthwash, or toothpaste. He states once his sores began to get a little painful, he went to buy a special mouthwash for oral sores (unsure name). His only reported allergy is to Lisinopril, which his reaction was a whole body rash.    He states they did not pack his nose or do anything for his epistaxis at the ER, but eventually he let the nostril clot with blood. Now he feels fullness in the nare, but does not want to disturb the clot in fear that it will re-bleed. His wife also noticed a petechial rash that began on his BLE, he is unsure when that started.    He presented to  ED on 4/13, due to his PCP  instructing him to be evaluated when he had outpatient labs done and revealed a PLT count of 4,000. In the ED, the patient had normal vital signs.  He was transfused one unit of PLTs. He also had a negative head CT. He was also started on decadron 40mg PO daily by heme/onc. Patient tells me today his sores are less painful and feel smaller than usual. Heme/onc also ordered 2 IVIG 1,000 mg/kg/day x2 doses.

On May 4 he was really weak, moving much more slowly than normal, complaining of sinus headache above left eye, sleeping longer and more than normal, brain fog and confusion, not able to do normal activities.  This impairment has continued through May 11 with no improvement from one day to the next.  Visited his Dr to get checked on May 11 due to our concern over how long this was lasting.   He has had no fever but some chills here and there.  Dr checked everything she could think of and requested blood tests which we have not heard about yet.  Extreme fatigue was the major symptom.

                                                One month after the vaccine I started to get Hot Flashes followed by pain. The pain lasted for six hours and then went away. The pain is all over my body The process returned after a week or so and it has continued intermittently since then. The cycle is always the same. I get a hot flash and then the pain starts. As time goes on it is happening more often and the pain lasts for longer. I get really hot and sweat for about 15 minutes and then the pain starts. It builds up to being a more severe pain which has been lasting up to 24 hours. It has been getting less often and for slightly shorter periods of pain. Just in the last two weeks I started to get pain at the injection site, and it is starting to affect my whole arm around the area. It is like a muscle pain. I have consulted my doctor and She prescribed Tramadol. It seems to help but over the counter medications don&#39;t seem to work.

                                                Per Regulatory Authority it is to be reported if patient gets COVID if fully vaccinated.  Per MD note 1.  Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure:  This is in a patient with COVID pneumonia.  The patient was placed on supplemental oxygen.  The plan is for the patient to use supplemental oxygen with oxygen by nasal cannula up to 6 L and if oxygen saturation falls below 90% on 6 L oxygen by nasal cannula, he will be transitioned to high-flow oxygen.  However, if he is on maximal support with high-flow oxygen with oxygen saturation falling below 90%, the patient should be placed on BiPAP and transferred to the ICU.  The patient is a full code. 2.  COVID pneumonia:  This in a patient who apparently received his Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine 3 weeks ago.  The patient started on treatment with remdesivir.  He will get steroids.  He is prescribed Tessalon Perles and Robitussin with codeine as needed for coughing.  He may be considered for potentially other treatments in the setting of his COVID pneumonia, especially if his respiratory status deteriorates.  We will closely follow up in the COVID unit after admission. 3.  Alteration of mental status and encephalopathy:  This in a patient who is hypoglycemic.  However, part of his encephalopathy related to his COVID infection and volume depletion.  He is being volume repleted and treated for his condition.  He will have frequent neurologic checks done after admission. 4.  Generalized weakness and deconditioning:  This is in a volume depleted patient with COVID.  His COVID will be appropriately treated and he will be volume repleted.  He will need to work with physical and occupational therapy towards the end of the hospitalization. 5.  Congestive heart failure, systolic plus diastolic dysfunction:  The patient does not have any evidence of acute congestive heart failure at the moment.  However, we will take care to prevent volume overload in this patient, who requires volume repletion in the setting of his volume depletion. 6.  Volume depletion:  The patient will get another liter of IV fluids after admission at 80 mL per hour as tolerated.  The goal is to avoid excessive IV fluid administration in this patient with COVID pneumonia.

That night: halucinatory dreams, woke up  and had difficulty with orientation - room spinning, difficulty walking came back to bed, bed spinning.  Got up later room spinning vertically - took several minutes to settle down.  This problem has gotten worse as the days go by.  This morning, dizziness persists longer than before, feeling of strong nausea, near vomiting, cannot walk in a straight line.  Fear of falling.   These are symptoms of vertigo I believe.  Should I go to a doctor?  Feeling that this will get worse.  Difficulty concentrating.  Quite an unsettling and scary experience.

This started out mild and as the week went on got worse.  Symptoms were leg swelling, shortness of breath, persistent stomach pain, headache, and chestpain.

                                                Patient caregiver reports that he woke up at 2 a.m. the morning after the vaccine unable to hold his urine which is unusual for him.  He also reported extreme acid reflux symptoms whenever he attempted to drink any fluids at that time as well as nausea.  This progressed to difficulty breathing at which time the caregiver was alerted and checked his blood pressure.  This reading was 88/55 according to the caregiver and the pulse was very high as well but the actual number could not be remembered.  The difficulty breathing prompted them to alert emergency medical services where he was picked up and transported to the emergency room via ambulance shortly after for evaluation.

                                                The patient began having flu-like symptoms the following day after the vaccine.  Felt achy, fatigue and not wanting to get out of bed even on vacation.  That lasted for 2 weeks and still not great even now.  The patient&#39;s  spouse reported trouble walking, stumbling, falling and gait.  The patient developed a cough a few weeks ago and is currently being treated with antibiotics called in from the physician.  The patient has not see a physician for diagnosis.  I encouraged the patient to be evaluated as soon as possible

IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING REMOVAL OF NEEDLE AFTER INJECTION, THE PATIENT APPEARED TO FAINT FALLING FORWARD IN HIS OWN LAP. AFTER ABOUT 15 TO 30 SECONDS, HE REGAINED CONSCIOUS. WE ASSESSED THE PATIENT TO ASK IF HE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED FAINTING BEFORE  OR SPECIFICALLY DURING VACCINATION. HE HAD NO PREVIOUS EPISODES. WE QUICKLY OFFERED THE PATIENT SOME WATER AND CRACKERS WHILE HE REMAINED SEATED. THE PATIENT FELL FORWARD AGAIN AND APPEARED TO BE CONVULSING. ONCE HE STABILIZED, MY PARTNER STEPPED AWAY TO RETRIEVE WATER, AND THE PATIENT ONCE AGAIN FELL FORWARD AND BEGAN CONVULSING. ONCE HE STABILIZED, HE DRANK SOME WATER AND ATE SOME CRACKERS. HE MENTIONED THAT HE FELT EXTREMELY TIRED. WE INSISTED TO CALL THE PARAMEDICS FOR HELP,BUT HE DECLINED SAYING THAT HE WAS OK AND MAYBE THE NEEDLE TRIGGERED THE EVENT. AFTER WE OBSERVED THE PATIENT FOR 30 MINUTES AND HE ASSURED US HE WAS IN STABLE CONDITION, HE LEFT WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND. PATIENT WAS CALLED TWICE AFTER THE EVENT TO FOLLOW-UP BUT WE HAVE NOT HAD SUCCESS IN FOLLOW-UP.

Then two days later he could not move his left shoulder, and could not move his arm.  If he moves it across his chest feels like somebody is stabbing him.  His lower back is also in a lot of pain, the entire back.   It now feels like a ball rolling from left to right, and sometimes it is both, and then perhaps one or the other. It has also affected his bowel movements as well, watery bowel movements.  He now goes 3-4 times a day.  When he relieves himself the pain subsides    He still continues to have the pain.   He went to his PCP and he gave him OTC medicines that helped some but did not get rid of the pain, especially in his lower back as it felt like somebody was stabbing him, as well as his left arm.   His PCP sent him to pain management and that didn&#39;t work.  He gave him 6 shots into his back, 3 on each side which did not relieve the pain.  He went back to that doctor last week, and has a friend who is in charge of an x-ray company and got an  x-ray.  His lower back didn&#39;t show much of anything.  He went back to pain management and told him to come back and went last week and told him that it could be arthritis and gave him some exercises, stretches, and he couldn&#39;t help him.   He gave him some Tylenol with codeine for the pain, but has not taken them all.     He is improving with his symptoms very slowly and is now able to move some and do exercises which are helping him.  He was almost paralyzed before and now able to move some.  He is waiting for the effects to just leave his body.

                                                BLOOD BEHIND THE RETINA; FATIGUE/FEELING TIRED; This spontaneous report received from a consumer concerned an 86 year old male. The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included diabetes, latex tape allergy, alcohol user (once in a while), and non-smoker. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1808980 expiry: 04-AUG-2021) dose was not reported, administered on 05-APR-2021 to left arm for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  The consumer reported that after taking the vaccine, for the first week the patient had no side effect and felt fine. In APR-2021 (about 3 weeks after vaccination), the patient experienced  fatigue and feeling tired and both eyes got blurry and cloudy (left eye more severe than the right eye). Further consumer stated that, the patient went to see an eye doctor because the blurry cloudy vision persisted. The eye doctor referred him to a more specialized eye doctor who diagnosed him with blood behind the retina and gave him shots in the eye to help the blood dissipate. The patient&#39;s right eye had been cleared but the blurriness in the left eye had not been resolved. The consumer was concerned that it could had been a blood clot that traveled to the eye because the patient never had any issues like that before. And also mentioned that it could had been some age related eye issue but he was not sure. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from fatigue/feeling tired, and blood behind the retina. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: 20210626620-covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s-blood behind the retina- This event(s) is considered not related.

Rapid decline began about 2 weeks after receiving vaccine. Death would likely have occurred on  5/6/2021 or 5/7/2021 but for hospital intervention via use of a BiPAP machine. Patient had been exhibiting more mild, non-COVID respiratory distress for some time, back to at least late 2020, and likely at even lower levels for several years prior. Signs and symptoms included shallow breathing, extreme fatigue, difficulty or inability to lie down, occasional lightheadedness, etc. Oxygen saturation levels in April, as measured by a pulse oximeter, ranged from about 87%-96%. On May 6, it measured 65% just prior to ER visit.
