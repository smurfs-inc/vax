                                                Patient states on Friday, 4/9, he went to the pharmacy to receive his J&amp;J Covid-19 vaccine. He states on Saturday morning, his R nostril began to bleed, and continued to bleed until Monday. He states on Wednesday, 4/7, he noticed oral sores that at first were not painful, but large. He was worried about it interfering with his shot, but because he had waited so long to get it, he decided to proceed anyway. He denies any fever or chills, no frank diarrhea, but occasional loose stools, without blood seen. He denies HA, vision changes, or focal neuro deficits. On Sunday, 4/11, the patient ended up going to ED to evaluate his epistaxis, the MD attributed it to his elevated BP, the patient reports it being 160s/90s. They gave him new BP medications, which he took, but when he saw the Dr., he instructed the patient not to keep taking his BP meds. When asking the patient if anything correlates with foods he eats, the only thing he can pinpoint it to, would be pico de gallo. He states it has irritated his mouth before. He also reports recently taking his wife&#39;s supplement (unknown name) but thinks it is for cholesterol. He took that approximately 1 week ago. No new changes in food habits, mouthwash, or toothpaste. He states once his sores began to get a little painful, he went to buy a special mouthwash for oral sores (unsure name). His only reported allergy is to Lisinopril, which his reaction was a whole body rash.    He states they did not pack his nose or do anything for his epistaxis at the ER, but eventually he let the nostril clot with blood. Now he feels fullness in the nare, but does not want to disturb the clot in fear that it will re-bleed. His wife also noticed a petechial rash that began on his BLE, he is unsure when that started.    He presented to  ED on 4/13, due to his PCP  instructing him to be evaluated when he had outpatient labs done and revealed a PLT count of 4,000. In the ED, the patient had normal vital signs.  He was transfused one unit of PLTs. He also had a negative head CT. He was also started on decadron 40mg PO daily by heme/onc. Patient tells me today his sores are less painful and feel smaller than usual. Heme/onc also ordered 2 IVIG 1,000 mg/kg/day x2 doses.

Small right pleural  effusion is seen. Minimal discoid atelectatic changes in the left perihilar  region and left lung base. Elevated right hemidiaphragm suggests eventration.   Admitted to Hospital 4/5/21, per admission diagnosis: Acute pulmonary embolism (*) submassive likely secondary to covid 19  Per hospital course notes:Patient presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was show to have submassive PE with severe pulmonary hypertension seen on TTE. He should be on lifelong therapy given 2nd VTE and severity.  Iwould consider unprovoked (COVID in 11/20 wouldn&#39;t count I wouldn&#39;t think).  He was started on eliquis 10 mg BID x 7 days than 5 mg bid. Given his severe pulm htn on TTE, left atrial pressure normal.  We would have outpatient sleep study as well He will need VQ scan to assure no CTEPH. Will have outpatient follow up. We discontinued his aspirin on discharge as well.

On May 4 he was really weak, moving much more slowly than normal, complaining of sinus headache above left eye, sleeping longer and more than normal, brain fog and confusion, not able to do normal activities.  This impairment has continued through May 11 with no improvement from one day to the next.  Visited his Dr to get checked on May 11 due to our concern over how long this was lasting.   He has had no fever but some chills here and there.  Dr checked everything she could think of and requested blood tests which we have not heard about yet.  Extreme fatigue was the major symptom.  Today, May 12, he feels better, moving around faster and doing some normal activities but still tires easily and must rest.

That night: halucinatory dreams, woke up  and had difficulty with orientation - room spinning, difficulty walking came back to bed, bed spinning.  Got up later room spinning vertically - took several minutes to settle down.  This problem has gotten worse as the days go by.  This morning, dizziness persists longer than before, feeling of strong nausea, near vomiting, cannot walk in a straight line.  Fear of falling.   These are symptoms of vertigo I believe.  Should I go to a doctor?  Feeling that this will get worse.  Difficulty concentrating.  Quite an unsettling and scary experience.

                                                Patient caregiver reports that he woke up at 2 a.m. the morning after the vaccine unable to hold his urine which is unusual for him.  He also reported extreme acid reflux symptoms whenever he attempted to drink any fluids at that time as well as nausea.  This progressed to difficulty breathing at which time the caregiver was alerted and checked his blood pressure.  This reading was 88/55 according to the caregiver and the pulse was very high as well but the actual number could not be remembered.  The difficulty breathing prompted them to alert emergency medical services where he was picked up and transported to the emergency room via ambulance shortly after for evaluation.

IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING REMOVAL OF NEEDLE AFTER INJECTION, THE PATIENT APPEARED TO FAINT FALLING FORWARD IN HIS OWN LAP. AFTER ABOUT 15 TO 30 SECONDS, HE REGAINED CONSCIOUS. WE ASSESSED THE PATIENT TO ASK IF HE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED FAINTING BEFORE  OR SPECIFICALLY DURING VACCINATION. HE HAD NO PREVIOUS EPISODES. WE QUICKLY OFFERED THE PATIENT SOME WATER AND CRACKERS WHILE HE REMAINED SEATED. THE PATIENT FELL FORWARD AGAIN AND APPEARED TO BE CONVULSING. ONCE HE STABILIZED, MY PARTNER STEPPED AWAY TO RETRIEVE WATER, AND THE PATIENT ONCE AGAIN FELL FORWARD AND BEGAN CONVULSING. ONCE HE STABILIZED, HE DRANK SOME WATER AND ATE SOME CRACKERS. HE MENTIONED THAT HE FELT EXTREMELY TIRED. WE INSISTED TO CALL THE PARAMEDICS FOR HELP,BUT HE DECLINED SAYING THAT HE WAS OK AND MAYBE THE NEEDLE TRIGGERED THE EVENT. AFTER WE OBSERVED THE PATIENT FOR 30 MINUTES AND HE ASSURED US HE WAS IN STABLE CONDITION, HE LEFT WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND. PATIENT WAS CALLED TWICE AFTER THE EVENT TO FOLLOW-UP BUT WE HAVE NOT HAD SUCCESS IN FOLLOW-UP.
