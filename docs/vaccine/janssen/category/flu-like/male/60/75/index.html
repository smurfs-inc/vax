                                                COVID infection post vaccination  1 day following vaccination, patient experienced fatigue, myalgia and low grade fever.  RA test positive.  That evening, patient with increasing SOB and increasing oxygen requirement and was admitted for hypoxia &#43; LE swelling.  Although SNF where vaccination took place denied symptoms at time of vaccination, per H&amp;P, increasing oxygen requirements were noted 3 days prior to vaccination.   See H&amp;P below  He is currently residing in a rehab facility following a hospitalization detailed below, but essentially he noted some shortness of breath about 4-5 days ago. They checked his oxygen saturation and noted that he was hypoxic, so started him on oxygen (reportedly 4L NC?). He reports a worsened productive cough; sputum is dark but not bloody in color. He has been fatigued and chilled; he thinks he&#39;s been intermittently febrile. No nausea, vomiting, or constipation. He endorses twice daily diarrhea, but he associates this with his bowel regimen. He also has a fair amount of lower extremity swelling which is bothersome to him; he says this has been ongoing since his MVA in January.[KE.4] He was recently seen in Nephrology clinic, where he was started on lasix 40mg daily and started on a low sodium diet[KE.3]. He is unsure if the lasix is helping his swelling, but does have robust urine output after he takes it

Up to a week after vaccine, I had low grade fever and chills; night sweating and coughing seemed to be getting worse and coughing getting more frequent and worse (when it had been dry and occasional). It was ongoing for a week. I called my Doctor during that time and she prescribed me medications including an antibiotic and cold medications for the cough. The medications helped symptoms after I&#39;d been on them awhile . I no longer have the fever and I stopped the night sweating. Cough seems to be improved.

                                                I had some fatigue the first couple of days but nothing that kept me from going to work - just took it slower and easier those days. The tinnitus started on 19th - ear pain on the right ear. I woke up that morning, I had pain. When I touched it I had pain on the front of my right ear.  ( It appears to be coming from my right ear.) I took some Zyrtec D to see if that would help me and I took that for two days and that seemed to help but then the ringing started. I notice it more at night when it&#39;s quiet or when I&#39;m working myself doing my maintenance work at rental units. I thought it was clogging of ear and so I was going to go to the doctor but I did ear drops and flushed for two days. It didn&#39;t subside anything with the ringing - I might be able to hear a little better. I don&#39;t have pain anymore as to the touch but I still have the tinnitus - the ringing in the ear - that constant sound. It has been continuing it seems to not be as bad but others it is. When I go to bed or when I wake up at night the ringing there it&#39;s hard to go back to sleep. I have an appt with the Ears, nose and throat doctor. My hearing doesn&#39;t seem to be affected, but I can&#39;t say for sure if it&#39;s any different - I&#39;m left handed so I use my left ear in the phone.

                                                abdominal aches and cramps gradually increasing in severity; walking and other core body movement provided temporary cessation of increasing severe pain;  the peak of severe pain was accompanied by a bowel movement, followed within about 5 minutes by body temperature increase, sweating, and profuse salivation such that saliva was swallowed every 2-3 seconds for a few minutes.   Treatment was a focus on breathing while practicing the turtle yoga position (forehead on floor with knees folded under abdomen) and then laying flat on back with one or both knees bent.  After 10-15 minutes of this treatment the symptoms (abdominal pain, high temp, profuse salivation) subsided.

                                                On day 4 after the Vaccine was administered, I felt a burning in my throat about the size of a dime. On day 5 the burning feeling was in my entire throat.  I was treating this like a Acid Reflux problem.  On day 6 the burning was there and I was also having an issue with my sinus.  There was blockage at times and other times a lot of mucus was coming out of my nose.  I also developed a cough.  I now started treating it like a head cold.  I took day and night cold remedies.  This continued for 8 more days without relief.  On day 9 I did have a 100.5 fever that went away while I slept throw the night.  I contacted my doctor and was able to see his PA.  I was tested for COVID19 and given a prescription for Doxycycline Hyc 100mg.  My COVID19 results were &#34;None Detected&#34;.  I&#39;ve taken 4 of my prescription pills  and haven&#39;t noticed a change.  I still have an Earache, sensitive left cheek bone, mucus coming from my nose and coughing.  The amount of coughing and mucus has lessened but the earache pain has not diminished.  I also have a bad headache this morning, 16 days after my vaccine was administered.

Was able to sleep, and by morning the fever was down to 100 degrees.  I still felt very tired and headachy.  I got up and had a small dish of cereal and then slept most of the morning.  By the afternoon the fever was gone, however had a headache and fatigue.  Took a Tylenol about 4 pm (24 hours after receiving the injection).  Headache cleared by the end of the day.  Still somewhat fatigued  72 hours after receiving the injection.  Stayed hydrated through the whole period.

I tried to explain that he had not had the two full weeks since being vaccinated to have full immunity and that he could have been exposed early enough that he was still able to develop into actual illness.

No difficulty breathing/swallow, thus gave water and gatorade. He was responsive to my questions. He has history of anxiety to needles and he did not eat lunch before vaccine. He stayed seated for 1 hour to monitor. Then, walked an aisle before driving home. Asked him to eat first before driving home. Called him twice and he is home and feeling okay. Counseled to call pharmacy if any symptoms of allergic reaction to vaccine.

                                                On Monday March 8th I went to the Pharmacy to get the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine under the new 1b guidelines. I am a 62 year old white male with type 1 diabetes, insulin dependent for the past 49 years. I filled out the question form I was presented by the staff and then was given a dose of the J&amp;J vaccine. This vaccine was administered at approx. 1:30 p.m. I was asked to wait 15 minutes to see if I had and acute reaction, following none, I was told I could leave. There rest of the day I was fine. I went to bed at 11:00 p.m. and within 15 minutes I was cold, shaking and sick on my stomach. I took my temp and it was 100.2 F My O2 sat was 95% and heart rate was 120 with feelings of palpitations from time to time. I went to the bathroom and stayed there the rest of the night with frequent vomiting and loose stool. Stomach cramps all night long. Several BGL were taken and even with an insulin pump I was not able to lower my 299 level for over the next 24 hours of repeated bolus. I was finally able to stop dry heaves and fall asleep for moments at a time around 5:00 a.m. My temp finally broke around 11:00 a.m. the next day Tuesday. I had a headache this entire time. I called hospital ( Ask a Nurse ) on Tuesday morning around 8:00 a.m.and enquired about side effects for this vaccine and effects on a type 1, they basically told me to go to the ER or Clinic and be seen by a Physician. I choose not to do either, but to monitor myself and see how the rest of the day went. The first time, other than a headache and complete body soreness my vitals and BGL, were WNL,  was late Tuesday evening around 7:00 p.m. This was a horrible set of side effects. Onset was within 11 hours from injection. No warning for type 1 people to be careful for the possibilities of increased BGL. Today is Wednesday March 10th, and my vitals have remained WNL, but I still have a mild headache and body soreness, some maybe from the vaccine but I believe mostly from the throwing up. Today is March 11th, my vitals are still WNL and BGL is in target. BGL control is responsive to pump therapy now. The past 2 nights I have awoken in a cold soaking sweat that cannot be tied to a low BGL. My body is somewhat still soreness.

Legs intermittently felt numb and at time with &#34;pins and needles&#34; tingling. Knee joints felt as if in danger of flexing backwards. Arms were similarly affected but not as drastically as legs. Arms had better function and control than legs but with marked weakness.  Day 2: Some improvement. Able to go to work but still have fatigue and leg weakness persist. It takes additional mental and physical effort to walk. Walking does not feel automatic or safe like it was before. Still have high level of fatigue. Symptoms improve  some later in the afternoon.

I took my blood pressure at home and it was extremely high.  My wife called my Doctor who said go to the E.R.   Once there they took my blood pressure and it was over 200.  The ER Doctor gave me a nitroGlycerin pill to get the blood pressure down.  They did multiple test on my heart.  The pain went away once the blood pressure went down.  I spent the nite in the hospital and was released after numerous test the next day.

                                                Patient passed out after receiving janssen covid-19 vaccine. There was no injection site reaction, no wheezing, or rash/hives. Patient had vision loss, dilated pupils, sweaty, unable focus or respond to use questions being asked, and  was having trouble hearing-said he had ringing in his ears. We were able to lay him on the floor without injuries-he did not fall. I was fanning him and we were talking to him. He got a little worse but then got better. When he was better, he said that he had passed out before when having blood taken. He did not mention this to me before the vaccine was administered. I do not feel that the Janssen COVID shot was the cause, I think he just passes out from injections or needles. We did call 911 when he was getting worse. By the time they got here, he was better but they did check him.

That night, 3/27 around 9 PM I began to feel cold as if I was running a fever and started having body aches.  I did not take my temperature to see if I actually did have a fever.  The symptoms lasted most of the night.   The next day, 3/28 I had the flu-like symptoms again at night.

Narrative from family below:  &#34;Day 1 (The day he took the vaccine): My father was complaining of very heavy chest pressure (said he felt like his chest was being pushed down with force.) He felt really tired and had a nasty headache.   Day 2 He began to feel tingles in his legs and arms. Said he felt sore and had mild pain around his back, feet, legs, hands, and arms. The headache came in and out.   Day 3 He began feeling more severe pains in both legs &#43; headache. More tingling around his face, lips, and jaw.  Day 4 Severe pain continued around his entire body. Had an episode where he lost vision from 1 eye (he described it as blurry vision) felt like he was going blind from one eye.  Day 5 Could barely stand on his two feet and could no longer go to work. He stayed in bed and then hospital visits began. My mom took him to emergency for the first time.  I was able to get details of the location where he was vaccinated and onsite contact information. The info is below:

After speaking, his eyes then went closed, and he clenched his fists and he started coughing up liquid. He was not responsive. He was moved to the ground and turned on his side. He became alert about 3 minutes after becoming unresponsive. He claimed this happens to him when he is at doctor&#39;s offices or receiving vaccines/procedures. He claimed it was &#34;normal.&#34; He said he felt fine/normal, and this has happened in the past, though he did not mention this to the pharmacist prior to administration. 911 was called and examined him. He was allowed to go home on his own, did not go to the hospital.

                                                Patient received vaccine on 3/13, initially had fatigue and myalgia the day after, which resolved, but also on 3/14 began having mild intermittent coughing, nonproductive, occurring every two hours or less. Patient began having some blood in his sputum since this morning at 4AM, and that occurred twice more with intervals of a few hours, both continuously improving and less blood. No other symptoms. No history of TB, no exposure to sick contacts, no recent travel. Unlikely a pulmonary embolus given normal vital signs and no risk factors. Patient was doing outdoor work in his yard for the past few days before the symptom onset and was working on mulch and compost. Although unlikely to have fungal infection currently, may be bacterial pneumonia

                                                I was up all night with chills, fever (101&#43;) and severe headache.  The headache is what kept me from being able to sleep.  I wasn&#39;t sure if it was ok to take otc pain meds so I waited until morning (9:30 am) to call my doc. Fever had subsided, but still had intense headache.  Doc told me to take 2 extra strength Tylenol which I did. Headache was relieved within 45 minutes.  I was able to sleep.  Felt much better afterwards although still struggled with fatigue and mild headache for approx 80 hours following vaccine.

A little more than a year ago (Feb 2020) I have L4/L5 fusion surgery. The surgery was successful and for the last six month had little to no pain (no more than a 1 on the pain scale).

Today, Sunday March 7th the pain is much better (about  a 2 on the pain scale and I think will completely go away as I move around more and loosen up.

Was hospitalized on March 23  and diagnosed with interstitial lung disease and is currently on a ventilator.  The diagnosis is unknown but suspected amiodorone toxicity or Sjogrens.  Both are rare  side effects.  He is on high dose steroids and  antibiotics but  no improvement.   Has never had lung issues prior to the shot.  He has never smoked.  Onset of disease was rapid and progressed quickly.   Is it possible shot triggered the acute lung disease?

                                                I spoke to patient by phone on Saturday morning around 9:20am. He was concerned about the fatigue, nausea, headache, chills, and muscle aches he had the night before. He felt better when I spoke to him. He wanted to know when those side effects would go away finally. Since I had the Moderna vaccine I said 24 to 36 hours. But I didn&#39;t know about the J&amp;J vaccine. We disconnect the call at 9:40am Saturday morning. After the call at some point he fixed lunch or dinner and stopped eating before finishing his meal. He had left the food on the table and in the pans he fixed it in. Very unusual for him.  The patient then went to his room where is was found Monday 3/22/21 around noon in his bed laying on his chest (he hated to lie on his chest) by the police and the HR officer from his work.   The HR officer had called my other brother around 11:15am on 3/22 /21 to ask if we had heard from the patient because he had not reported to work or phoned in. He has passed sometime between noon on Saturday till Sunday evening alone at his residence. He had towels and a trash can beside his bed when he was found.  The coroner call it death by natural causes and would not do an autopsy when even asked by his PCP.

                                                Body chills. In going to bed I had heavy clothing, bathrobe  and multiple blankets to offset the chills. During the night I woke up overheated and bathed in sweat. Got up to go to the bathroom for BM but was nauseous, feeling need to vomit at the same time. After BM I stood and still felt need to  do one or the other or both when I passed out. Wife came upstairs and found me sitting up against the corner wall. She was able to shake me awake while calling 911. I was groggy but aware I was still nauseous and  stayed down next to toilet until stomach settled. I came downstairs and EMTs arrived. Took blood pressure. Result was it was low. Took EKG and that was normal. Second  blood pressure test  showed that I rebounded.  When offered I felt it unnecessary to go to hospital.

Then waves of oversensitivity with knee and foot joints hurting as if arthritis, and this lasted most of the night. I also experienced strange hallucinations in the night as if I had a high fever but I don&#39;t believe I had a fever, and I also had a migraine and neck pain. The arm where the vaccine was applied is fine and not sore at all.  I also have a slight soreness in my stomach as if I had been coughing for a while, which was not the case.  It is now 11:34 AM the following day and I believe I&#39;m getting back to my normal self but it sure was a rough night and I though you should be aware.

Had a 101.5 degree temperature all night which went down to 100 in the morning and back up to 101.2 later on the 14th.  I had nausea and extreme pain all over my body and restlessness.  it got a little better the next day but still feels like I have the flu. I had covid back in march of 2020 and was tested for the antibodies at the end of August.  There is a horrific dearth of research on people who have had covid and whether they should get the vaccines. It is disgraceful, and the next time I will listen to my gut which told me NOT to get vaccinated!

                                                Suspected pneumonitis.  Patient presented on day following vaccination as shortness of breath, nausea, and diarrhea were not abating with home management. They had started later in the day after the vaccination.  At ER admission - SpO2 = 80% room air. Nasal cannula was applied and SpO2 recovered quickly.  BNP was elevated so acute exacerbation of heart failure was suspected and treated. However, patient did not improve with diuresis.  Viral workup and bacterial cause workup negative. No acute cardiac events discovered. Patient continued to decline. Transferred to ICU on 3-19-21 to use BiPAP with 65% FiO2 and able to take breaks to 15L nasal cannula. Borderline blood pressures at this time.  Infectious disease, pulmonology, cardiology, nephrology, and critical care anesthesia services evaluated and ruled out multiple possible diagnoses and patient continued to decline.  Diagnostic bronchoscopy on 3-22-21 with BAL lead to patient ventilator dependent with profound hypotension.  Aggressive ICU management ensued.  Bronchoscopy very clean with no real secretions - in line with CT evidence of pneumonitis.  Despite aggressive care and maximized pressor support, patient expired on 3-29-21 when family chose to withdraw care as blood pressure declined again.

                                                One day after the vaccine I had extreme muscle and join pain all over body, general malaise, fever.  This lasted for about 3 days.  About 10 days post vaccine, the symptoms returned with a ferocious energy.  The pain in my muscles and joints is so severe that I can&#39;t roll over in bed, have difficulty walking, and getting on and off the toilet. It interrupts my sleep so that I play musical bed-chair-couch throughout the night.  Needless to say, it exacerbates the level of pain and fatigue I&#39;m already experiencing.  It is life debilitating as I cannot participate in my usual daily activities of walking, hiking, gardening, biking, etc.  As a result of joint and muscle stiffness, I am also now experiencing headaches. These extreme conditions have persisted from March 23- April 9...and I don&#39;t see relief in the future.

He received the J&amp;J vaccination at noon by local public health nurse on Mon 4/12/21. The patient&#39;s wife, reported to hospice team that he had been sleepy during the day and had received a dose of Ativan  earlier that morning (PRN medication at 0750). The primary hospice nurse reported wife noted he became more lethargic throughout the day after vaccination with his condition worsening at 1720; at that time his blood sugar levels were noted to be low at &#34;47&#34; but patient was alert enough to drink orange juice, eat ice cream. The patient continued to deteriorate so MD was consulted and he was transported to the ED where he later expired at 1930.

                                                I didn&#39;t have pain in the arm, after an hour I had a slight headache. The headache lasted about a day. After the 3-4 day I had serve diarrhea and stopped taking my supplements. It stopped for a couple days then came back for a day. I had no headache or pain, just 3 bad episodes of diarrhea. On March 24th I went into the Hospital with severe pain in my lower left back side. I thought I was passing a kidney side, with the pain I was having. When I got there they did a CT scan and blood work and it wasn&#39;t kidney stone but I had a blood clot on the lower left side of lung and the right side as well. They immediate put me on blood thinners. I was there for a day and a night. They released and put me on medication.  I&#39;ve had minor pain but nothing like the pain I had before. I have since followed up with a Pomologist and PCP. Pulmonologist said I had blood clots but couldn&#39;t give me a cause. My PCP said she thought I had or have Covid. I asked to have my blood drawn and she said it was too late for that because I had taken the vaccine already.

Then incredibly painful bone pain in the chest - originally thought it was a heart attack.  It is random  and acute pain in the chest / rib area. It varies in duration and length of time between attacks. The pain is so acute it is hard to manage. Also this appears to have attacked my lungs as I am very short of breath and cannot do any exertion. The body ache, incredible chest bone pain, joint pain and difficulty breathing have continued as I finish day 6 post injection.

                                                I felt fatigued for 2 days after the vaccination and then no issues until around day 16. I developed chills, fever, headache, neck aches, malaise and extreme fatigue that lasted 12 days and then resolved for the most part except still experiencing some fatigue. I was concerned because I was expecting side effect shortly after the vaccine however the symptoms were very much delayed. Although I have been very isolated before and after the vaccine I grew concerned I may have been exposed to COVID though highly unlikely and got a PCR covid test which came back negative

                                                On Thursday, March 18, I had some slight dizziness during the day. After going to bed that night I woke up and the night light in the smoke alarm on the ceiling appeared to be spinning. I sat, then stood, grabbling walls for support and attempted to reach my recliner. At that point I was severely dizzy, completely lost any sense of balance and collapsed into the chair. I could not stand or walk. After 20 minutes, I asked my wife to call an ambulance. I did not think she would be able to get me into our car. The paramedics ran an EKG and tested me for a stroke. Both were normal. I was transported to the ER. The doctor gave me Meclizine. Had a CT scan of my brain, and blood work. All results normal. Dizziness resolved. They tested my balance and then released me at 3:30 a.m. on March 19. I was tired that day, but did not need further medication. During that night, as I turned over in bed, the vertigo returned. I took a Meclizine and went to the recliner for the remainder of the night. I am feeling somewhat fuzzy today, March 20. Not sure how long this will continue, or if it is related to my Covid vaccination. However, I am reporting it in the event that others may be experiencing this problem as well.

I still have a itchy spot on my stomach.  On the morning of March 29, 2021 I could not get warm.  I covered myself with blankets and in the evening after not eating anything I went to bed.  The next day I was still cold.  I didn?t feel better until the next day.  I am still blotchy.

                                                3/22/21 Admission HPI: 71 y.o. male with a history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and COPD.  He presented to my office today acutely with a several day history of increasing shortness of breath.  He has increased his prednisone at home recently and been increasing the frequency of his DuoNebs.  Despite this, he states that his oxygen saturations have been staying in the low 80s.  He has a hard time walking due to the shortness of breath.  He states previous to about a week ago he was doing very well.  He denies any fever.  He denies any known exposure to coronavirus (COVID-19).  In the office today his oxygen saturations were 88% on 4 L. Because of his failure of outpatient therapy, he will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.  This patient has a history of severe respiratory decompensation that happens very quickly.  Therefore, it is medically urgent we get him into the hospital.     3/25/21 Admission HPI71 y.o. male with a known history of severe COPD and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  He came to my office with a several day history of increasing shortness of breath.  He had increased his oral steroids and breathing treatments at home and despite this was still having oxygen saturations in the low to mid 80s on 2-4 L of supplemental oxygen.  In my office he was extremely diminished and had basically failed outpatient therapy.  Therefore he was admitted to inpatient status for acute treatment of a severe COPD exacerbation requiring IV antibiotics and IV steroids.  He was admitted and treated with IV treatments.  He did recover nicely.  However, he was found to be extremely physically deconditioned.  Because of this he was thought to be an excellent candidate for swing bed and is being transitioned to swing bed.    4/5/21 ER Practitioner Note: Upon arrival to ED trauma room I found patient to be in cardiac arrest, CPR in progress. History is that EMS was called to the scene for a patient with chest pain.  Shortly after arrival at his home  patient developed a cardiac arrest.  They followed standard ACLS  protocol and the patient was intubated. Blood sugar normal. As CPR was given, medications were administered consisting of epinephrine and 1 mg in 2 different doses along with 1 amp of bicarb. IV access via an IO. Patient was then transported to the emergency department.  Upon arrival, CPR was continued and oxygen supplied via endotracheal tube with good tube placement verified by auscultation and good sat readings.  Monitor was placed and patient demonstrated initially a sinus rhythm but there was no pulse.  Therefore, diagnosis was PEA and no reversible causes were identified.  ACLS protocol was followed with epinephrine 1 mg IV every 5 min.  He received a total that including EMS, 5 mg of epinephrine and 1 amp of bicarb.  Monitor at this point revealed the rhythm changed to an agonal rhythm.  When CPR was given, there was good results from the CPR.  However, CPR discontinued and there is no pulse and patient had an agonal  rhythm for several minutes, pupils were fixed but not dilated year.  Lungs demonstrating clear bilateral breath sounds when he was bagged via the endotracheal tube.  No external signs of any trauma noted. The patient&#39;s sister is here and she is a registered nurse.  We had discussed management at this point with her and all were in agreement that the code be terminated.  At 1015, patient was pronounced deceased..    ACLS protocol was followed.  See nursing record for medication and vital sign details.   Code outcome: Deceased   CC time 20 minutes.

                                                Approx 10 minutes after injection, pt reported his lower checks were starting to itch and he felt a little swelling in his check bones. Pt also stated he wasn&#39;t having any trouble breaking, skin tone look normal, pt was able to communicate with no problems. He stated the symptoms he was experiencing were something he was used to. It happens to him when he eats chicken  and certain kinds of foods (especially seafood/shellfish). I offered him benadryl and an ice pack while he was here. He refused the ice pack, but did  agree to low dose of benadryl. He took one Allergy Relief 25mg softgel and then continued to set for a little over 30 minutes total before he said he was fine and left with his wife.  I contacted him around 11:50am, he was doing fine and enjoying a good lunch.

                                                My father received his shot on March 13, 2021.  He drove to move home and on March 28th started having his right arm go numb but did not tell us.  He asked to go the ER March 29th at 6:45am saying his chest hurt and was having a hard time breathing, this has happened before since having Covid in September.  I called 911 after he became dizzy and could not walk.  While at the ER suffered a massive stroke that paralyzed him from his nose down over a course of 3 days.  His brain stem was affected and he lost the ability to swallow.  After being on a ventilator for 72 hours he was removed from it and died less then 30 mins later from drowning in his own saliva on April 1, 2021.
