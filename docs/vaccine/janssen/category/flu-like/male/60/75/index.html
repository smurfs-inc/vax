They checked his oxygen saturation and noted that he was hypoxic, so started him on oxygen (reportedly 4L NC?). He reports a worsened productive cough; sputum is dark but not bloody in color. He has been fatigued and chilled; he thinks he&#39;s been intermittently febrile. No nausea, vomiting, or constipation. He endorses twice daily diarrhea, but he associates this with his bowel regimen. He also has a fair amount of lower extremity swelling which is bothersome to him; he says this has been ongoing since his MVA in January.[KE.4] He was recently seen in Nephrology clinic, where he was started on lasix 40mg daily and started on a low sodium diet[KE.3]. He is unsure if the lasix is helping his swelling, but does have robust urine output after he takes it

                                                I had some fatigue the first couple of days but nothing that kept me from going to work - just took it slower and easier those days. The tinnitus started on 19th - ear pain on the right ear. I woke up that morning, I had pain. When I touched it I had pain on the front of my right ear.  ( It appears to be coming from my right ear.) I took some Zyrtec D to see if that would help me and I took that for two days and that seemed to help but then the ringing started. I notice it more at night when it&#39;s quiet or when I&#39;m working myself doing my maintenance work at rental units. I thought it was clogging of ear and so I was going to go to the doctor but I did ear drops and flushed for two days. It didn&#39;t subside anything with the ringing - I might be able to hear a little better. I don&#39;t have pain anymore as to the touch but I still have the tinnitus - the ringing in the ear - that constant sound. It has been continuing it seems to not be as bad but others it is. When I go to bed or when I wake up at night the ringing there it&#39;s hard to go back to sleep. I have an appt with the Ears, nose and throat doctor. My hearing doesn&#39;t seem to be affected, but I can&#39;t say for sure if it&#39;s any different - I&#39;m left handed so I use my left ear in the phone.

                                                I had a residual cough when I had the vaccine. Up to a week after vaccine, I had low grade fever and chills; night sweating and coughing seemed to be getting worse and coughing getting more frequent and worse (when it had been dry and occasional). It was ongoing for a week. I called my Doctor during that time and she prescribed me medications including an antibiotic and cold medications for the cough. The medications helped symptoms after I&#39;d been on them awhile . I no longer have the fever and I stopped the night sweating. Cough seems to be improved.

                                                abdominal aches and cramps gradually increasing in severity; walking and other core body movement provided temporary cessation of increasing severe pain;  the peak of severe pain was accompanied by a bowel movement, followed within about 5 minutes by body temperature increase, sweating, and profuse salivation such that saliva was swallowed every 2-3 seconds for a few minutes.   Treatment was a focus on breathing while practicing the turtle yoga position (forehead on floor with knees folded under abdomen) and then laying flat on back with one or both knees bent.  After 10-15 minutes of this treatment the symptoms (abdominal pain, high temp, profuse salivation) subsided.

The first afternoon I felt a bit feverish with chills and took a couple Tylenol which removed the feverish feeling but not the fatigue.  The second night I had full body trembles on and off for about an hour - not strong enough to disturb my wife who was sleeping in the same bed.  I felt much better Friday morning but there is a little lingering fatigue.

Today, April 17th, I believe they did a cat scan of his lungs to check for blood clots and I am not sure of the results.

                                                10 days after the shot, my blood pressure rose to 198/112 and my pulse went to 161. and i called 911 and went to hospital.  i had a severe headache for 3 days leading up to calling 911. finally on the April 1st, i went to hospital. i had a lump on my right shoulder never there before and i felt like the lump was causing my right side of my face to be numb.  The hospital refused to believe me that i had some blood clot, they downplay the incident and instead gave me a brain CT SACN and brain  MRA which was negative, they kept me for observation overnight and let me go noon the next day.  since i have had follow ups with my regular doctor, a cardiologist and my nephrologist.  I know that reaction was due to medication, either way glad i got the shot.  BUT Since this time, I am retaining water, i know this because my rings do not fit anymore, rings i had for 20 years, never ever once had a hard time to put on or remove. I know my body, thats not the worse of it. i test my blood pressure every day at requesting of my kidney doctor,   since the incudent of my pressure 198/112 my diastolic on average is raised  20 points.  I log this daily.  here are some examples from before the medication  111/67 ,  109/63 ,   129/64 , 105/62 120/81.   now my pressure is totally different for example, 155/88  150/91  157/90 ,  134/88.  nothing else changed in my life, I am exactly the same as before only now i have covid shot..  yesterday i saw the 4th doctor since i am shot up and she gave me a new pill  olmesartan medoxomil,  only on it one day but my diastolic pressure is still much higher than before.  i dont want to die, i dont want a stroke, or a heart attach, i have a lot to live for still.  nobody is helping me, doctors are just throwing pills at me and not treating root cause which i feel strongly to beleive it is from covid shot.

That helped   36 hours later my throught 1/2 of it, got very sore, like pins sticking inti it like a tonselitious maybe. Same time my mid/right side back started to hurt. Thought it might be gastral. Continious to this day and wordened up until today. Maybe Kidneys? or?? I was thinking again was gastral, but now I know it is not. Same pain when pressure put on it by bending, sitting in my truck against seats etc... Now I am worried. NEVEER had something like this other than a Gal Blagger which was removed.

On day 5 the burning feeling was in my entire throat.  I was treating this like a Acid Reflux problem.  On day 6 the burning was there and I was also having an issue with my sinus.  There was blockage at times and other times a lot of mucus was coming out of my nose.  I also developed a cough.  I now started treating it like a head cold.  I took day and night cold remedies.  This continued for 8 more days without relief.  On day 9 I did have a 100.5 fever that went away while I slept throw the night.  I contacted my doctor and was able to see his PA.  I was tested for COVID19 and given a prescription for Doxycycline Hyc 100mg.  My COVID19 results were &#34;None Detected&#34;.  I&#39;ve taken 4 of my prescription pills  and haven&#39;t noticed a change.  I still have an Earache, sensitive left cheek bone, mucus coming from my nose and coughing.  The amount of coughing and mucus has lessened but the earache pain has not diminished.  I also have a bad headache this morning, 16 days after my vaccine was administered.

Was able to sleep, and by morning the fever was down to 100 degrees.  I still felt very tired and headachy.  I got up and had a small dish of cereal and then slept most of the morning.  By the afternoon the fever was gone, however had a headache and fatigue.  Took a Tylenol about 4 pm (24 hours after receiving the injection).  Headache cleared by the end of the day.  Still somewhat fatigued  72 hours after receiving the injection.  Stayed hydrated through the whole period.

                                                Saturday evening May 1 I met with nine friends (all vaccinated) and ate a lot of food, drank moderately, and then did not sleep well. Approximately noon the next afternoon (Sunday, May2) while driving I noticed a developing dry-cough, chest congestion, and general fatigue. While camping that night I had some chills, thought I might have a bit of a fever, and had little appetite. I arrived home Tuesday, May 4 coughing a lot and very fatigued. Wednesday morning I went in for a Covid test. My cough and fatigue continued to increase along with muscle pain and headache. Wednesday night my fever topped out near 104. It broke and I felt much better but for the next few days (until around May 11) it fluctuated between normal and around 100-102. The Covid test came back negative but I went back for another just in case. It too came back negative. My temperature has now stabilized, the cough and congestion are mostly gone. I&#39;m still a bit tired but feeling much better. It seemed like a case of Covid without the Covid. I am glad I got vaccinated but that was rough.

No difficulty breathing/swallow, thus gave water and gatorade. He was responsive to my questions. He has history of anxiety to needles and he did not eat lunch before vaccine. He stayed seated for 1 hour to monitor. Then, walked an aisle before driving home. Asked him to eat first before driving home. Called him twice and he is home and feeling okay. Counseled to call pharmacy if any symptoms of allergic reaction to vaccine.

                                                On Monday March 8th I went to the Pharmacy to get the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine under the new 1b guidelines. I am a 62 year old white male with type 1 diabetes, insulin dependent for the past 49 years. I filled out the question form I was presented by the staff and then was given a dose of the J&amp;J vaccine. This vaccine was administered at approx. 1:30 p.m. I was asked to wait 15 minutes to see if I had and acute reaction, following none, I was told I could leave. There rest of the day I was fine. I went to bed at 11:00 p.m. and within 15 minutes I was cold, shaking and sick on my stomach. I took my temp and it was 100.2 F My O2 sat was 95% and heart rate was 120 with feelings of palpitations from time to time. I went to the bathroom and stayed there the rest of the night with frequent vomiting and loose stool. Stomach cramps all night long. Several BGL were taken and even with an insulin pump I was not able to lower my 299 level for over the next 24 hours of repeated bolus. I was finally able to stop dry heaves and fall asleep for moments at a time around 5:00 a.m. My temp finally broke around 11:00 a.m. the next day Tuesday. I had a headache this entire time. I called hospital ( Ask a Nurse ) on Tuesday morning around 8:00 a.m.and enquired about side effects for this vaccine and effects on a type 1, they basically told me to go to the ER or Clinic and be seen by a Physician. I choose not to do either, but to monitor myself and see how the rest of the day went. The first time, other than a headache and complete body soreness my vitals and BGL, were WNL,  was late Tuesday evening around 7:00 p.m. This was a horrible set of side effects. Onset was within 11 hours from injection. No warning for type 1 people to be careful for the possibilities of increased BGL. Today is Wednesday March 10th, and my vitals have remained WNL, but I still have a mild headache and body soreness, some maybe from the vaccine but I believe mostly from the throwing up. Today is March 11th, my vitals are still WNL and BGL is in target. BGL control is responsive to pump therapy now. The past 2 nights I have awoken in a cold soaking sweat that cannot be tied to a low BGL. My body is somewhat still soreness.

                                                I got the shot on a Saturday. On Sunday morning i felt ill, my chest was hurting.  By 3:00 pm it started to feel worse.  I took my blood pressure at home and it was extremely high.  My wife called my Doctor who said go to the E.R.   Once there they took my blood pressure and it was over 200.  The ER Doctor gave me a nitroGlycerin pill to get the blood pressure down.  They did multiple test on my heart.  The pain went away once the blood pressure went down.  I spent the nite in the hospital and was released after numerous test the next day.

                                                About 10 minutes after getting the shot, while waiting in the Doctor&#39;s waiting room, I began to feel dizzy and began sweating.  They moved me into an exam room, and which time I passed out.  I was awoken by the doctor standing over me, rubbing my chest.  I was subsequently transferred to the ER.

I got headaches, those have also continued since the 13th.  The following week my mouth began to hurt, I started coughing more than normal. First a dry cough, now I&#39;m coughing up phlegm with specks of blood. And I can not stop itching, and I&#39;m getting tired of taking benadryl for it. I contacted my doctor, all I got was these are normal reactions to the vaccine. They last 2 to 4 weeks. I already get migraines, my gut is picky since that shot. I used to eat hot peppers, now if I use pepper on my dinner my stomach is in pain. These side effects should be gone by now. I am one pissed off person.

                                                Patient passed out after receiving janssen covid-19 vaccine. There was no injection site reaction, no wheezing, or rash/hives. Patient had vision loss, dilated pupils, sweaty, unable focus or respond to use questions being asked, and  was having trouble hearing-said he had ringing in his ears. We were able to lay him on the floor without injuries-he did not fall. I was fanning him and we were talking to him. He got a little worse but then got better. When he was better, he said that he had passed out before when having blood taken. He did not mention this to me before the vaccine was administered. I do not feel that the Janssen COVID shot was the cause, I think he just passes out from injections or needles. We did call 911 when he was getting worse. By the time they got here, he was better but they did check him.

Received J&amp;J vaccine at 3 weeks ago. His current neurological examination and clinical history is suggestive of GBS  NEUROLOGICAL EXAM:  MSE: A&#43;Ox 3 Language: no aphasia   CRANIAL NERVES:  2nd CN: bilateral pupils are equal round and reaction to light, visual field-full 3rd,4th and 6th CN: EOM-I 5th CN: no sensory deficite 7th CN: face: symmetric, not able to smile or blowing air or holding water 8th CN: hearing loss: no 9, 10th CN: no dysarthria, palate movement:normal 11th CN: no neck weakness 12th CN: tongue: middle, no atrophy   MOTOR EXAM:  Tone: normal  Strength: 4&#43;/5 at bilateral UEs, 4 Pt symptoms started very early. Narrative from family below:  &#34;Day 1 (The day he took the vaccine): My father was complaining of very heavy chest pressure (said he felt like his chest was being pushed down with force.) He felt really tired and had a nasty headache.   Day 2 He began to feel tingles in his legs and arms. Said he felt sore and had mild pain around his back, feet, legs, hands, and arms. The headache came in and out.   Day 3 He began feeling more severe pains in both legs &#43; headache. More tingling around his face, lips, and jaw.  Day 4 Severe pain continued around his entire body. Had an episode where he lost vision from 1 eye (he described it as blurry vision) felt like he was going blind from one eye.  Day 5 Could barely stand on his two feet and could no longer go to work. He stayed in bed and then hospital visits began. My mom took him to emergency for the first time.  I was able to get details of the location where he was vaccinated and onsite contact information. The info is below:

Also blurry vision and inability to read words on a page. Sensing something wrong, my sister drove me to emergency room at Hospital where I was admitted. I was later told I suffered a stroke. I was in the hospital for 5 days, receiving various tests. (Hospital has all info on record).  I am awaiting surgery to remove blockage from carotid artery. Doctor has all my information and should be reporting the event also to VAERS.

                                                I started getting a headache about an hour along with pain in the back of my neck and a mild headache after my shot (maybe an hour or so).  Around 1100 hours, about the time I got back from the Facility, I began to feel a tightness in my throat and got a little raspy.  When I drank water and ate a little, it hurt similar a hangover as if dehydrated, but went away after a minute or so. About 1400 hours began to develop chills, causing me to get into bed, and then the chills, overall muscular pains, very tired, moderate headache and some nausea ensued as well along with an initial low grade fever.    Fever went up to 102.1 degrees and had fever till about 2130 hours and broken only after I took two (1) Tylenols. Still had a very low grade fever till about 2300 hours or so (99-100), but finally went away.    I awoke next day (13 APR) about 0800 feeling a bit better, but with a moderate headache and touch of diarrhea.  Headache lasted all day.  This prompted me to contact my treatment facility and a telecall was conducted giving them my symptoms.  They recommended Rizatriptan should my headache continue and Tylenol not enough to relieve.  I cannot take any analgesics due to my liver disease and Thrombocytopenia.  Finally  my headache went away (with a slight hint it might come back), but no more fever, chills etc.    On 14 APR, no more headache but still felt a little tired.  From 15 APR through today (16 APR), no further symptoms and feel great, but prepared to report anything that may develop laer.

The following day I began seeing swelling, redness, itching and burning of extremities (mainly the hands, but also feet, ears, face).

                                                Around 11 AM on 3/6/21 I began to feel very tired and lethargic. As I had driven  back that morning, I returned home and laid down for a nap. Later in the evening, I was still very tired and lethargic. I had no pain, swelling, or redness around my vaccination site. By Sunday morning, 3/7/21 I was feeling fine and have not experienced any symptoms since.

                                                10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient claimed he was feeling light headed and needed to lay down. After speaking, his eyes then went closed, and he clenched his fists and he started coughing up liquid. He was not responsive. He was moved to the ground and turned on his side. He became alert about 3 minutes after becoming unresponsive. He claimed this happens to him when he is at doctor&#39;s offices or receiving vaccines/procedures. He claimed it was &#34;normal.&#34; He said he felt fine/normal, and this has happened in the past, though he did not mention this to the pharmacist prior to administration. 911 was called and examined him. He was allowed to go home on his own, did not go to the hospital.

Patient began having some blood in his sputum since this morning at 4AM, and that occurred twice more with intervals of a few hours, both continuously improving and less blood. No other symptoms. No history of TB, no exposure to sick contacts, no recent travel. Unlikely a pulmonary embolus given normal vital signs and no risk factors. Patient was doing outdoor work in his yard for the past few days before the symptom onset and was working on mulch and compost. Although unlikely to have fungal infection currently, may be bacterial pneumonia

                                                I was up all night with chills, fever (101&#43;) and severe headache.  The headache is what kept me from being able to sleep.  I wasn&#39;t sure if it was ok to take otc pain meds so I waited until morning (9:30 am) to call my doc. Fever had subsided, but still had intense headache.  Doc told me to take 2 extra strength Tylenol which I did. Headache was relieved within 45 minutes.  I was able to sleep.  Felt much better afterwards although still struggled with fatigue and mild headache for approx 80 hours following vaccine.

At the end of my day it would clear up, my runny nose was back again. On the next morning I also experienced sore throat and a runny nose. This lasted about one week.  I went to my PCP, and they did a COVID test and I tested positive.  I can not taste anything, my nose is not runny and I have to blow up a few times a day. I have no fever 96.7F. I also get a minor phlegm when coughing.  At this time I can say my symptoms are a bit better when taking OTC Tylenol medication though I still can not taste anything.   I am taking fluids and taking Tylenol for my Covid symptoms.

All of the symptoms lasted for the next few days until Sunday morning (4/11/2021) when I then began to fell better and able to move around.   I receive the vaccine in my right arm but my left arm was the one that hurt and had trouble moving for a couple days.

About an hour after the vaccination, I began to lose my mental function.  My brain/mind were not functioning properly - to the point that I could hardly remember my name, let alone do anything on the computer that I was attempting to do.  At about that same time, I had a feeling of near complete exhaustion come over me, to the point of thinking I might faint at any moment. I went to my bedroom and laid down.  I fell asleep shortly there after and woke up approx 2.5 hours later.  After waking, I felt normal again.  I was able to process my thoughts and did not feel faint or exhausted any more.  It has been 1 month today since having the shot.  I have not felt any additional adverse affects to this point, other than the several hours after the shot. On a side note, I had not been sick prior to the shot or in the several months leading up to the shot.  I have also not been sick since the shot.  It was only the several hours on the day of the shot.

After 10 days I experienced severe pain at the site of injection, very small red spot appeared around injection site. Pain was so severe, I took one capsule hydrocodone 5-325 TB at 2 AM. The medication did not cure the pain, and I slept less than two hours. I called my nurse practitioner&#39;s office, and they offered an appoint late in the morning. And I couldn&#39;t wait that long so I drove to urgent care. Prompt care examined and saw no swelling, ruling out possible blood clot. Prompt care did not have ultra sound. They told me to use ice, heat, and pain medication. Extreme pain continued for about three more days, pain medication did very little to help. Unable to speak directly to the Nurse Practitioner on the phone, due to my disability and alexia, communicating online is very difficult without an assistant present. The pain slowly subsided over the next week.

This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 64-year-old African American (non-Hispanic/Latino) hypertensive male patient reported &#34;heart aching&#34; 20 minutes after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The event lasted for 15-20 minutes.  Other associated symptoms developed in the succeeding 3 days: chills that lasted for hours, could not move his neck and felt it was swelling and tender, headache, sleepiness, blood shot eyes.  Nine days after vaccination, the patient reported he had a knot in the center of arch right foot.  The patient took Aspirin.  No other details was reported.  The event is confounded by the underlying hypertension.  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

A little more than a year ago (Feb 2020) I have L4/L5 fusion surgery. The surgery was successful and for the last six month had little to no pain (no more than a 1 on the pain scale). Saturday a day after the vaccination my lower back pain was significant (5 to 6 on the pain scale). I am not sure if this was just a coincidence but thought it was worth reporting. Today, Sunday March 7th the pain is much better (about  a 2 on the pain scale and I think will completely go away as I move around more and loosen up.

Was hospitalized on March 23  and diagnosed with interstitial lung disease and is currently on a ventilator.  The diagnosis is unknown but suspected amiodorone toxicity or Sjogrens.  Both are rare  side effects.  He is on high dose steroids and  antibiotics but  no improvement.   Has never had lung issues prior to the shot.  He has never smoked.  Onset of disease was rapid and progressed quickly.   Is it possible shot triggered the acute lung disease?

Extreme headache with mild fever and other flu like symptoms. The reason why I am reporting this is that in my entire live I have have been so dizzy and unbalanced. I literally could not even sit up, I was super foggy and achey.  By 3 days all the symptoms cleared.

                                                I spoke to patient by phone on Saturday morning around 9:20am. He was concerned about the fatigue, nausea, headache, chills, and muscle aches he had the night before. He felt better when I spoke to him. He wanted to know when those side effects would go away finally. Since I had the Moderna vaccine I said 24 to 36 hours. But I didn&#39;t know about the J&amp;J vaccine. We disconnect the call at 9:40am Saturday morning. After the call at some point he fixed lunch or dinner and stopped eating before finishing his meal. He had left the food on the table and in the pans he fixed it in. Very unusual for him.  The patient then went to his room where is was found Monday 3/22/21 around noon in his bed laying on his chest (he hated to lie on his chest) by the police and the HR officer from his work.   The HR officer had called my other brother around 11:15am on 3/22 /21 to ask if we had heard from the patient because he had not reported to work or phoned in. He has passed sometime between noon on Saturday till Sunday evening alone at his residence. He had towels and a trash can beside his bed when he was found.  The coroner call it death by natural causes and would not do an autopsy when even asked by his PCP.

During the night I woke up overheated and bathed in sweat. Got up to go to the bathroom for BM but was nauseous, feeling need to vomit at the same time. After BM I stood and still felt need to  do one or the other or both when I passed out. Wife came upstairs and found me sitting up against the corner wall. She was able to shake me awake while calling 911. I was groggy but aware I was still nauseous and  stayed down next to toilet until stomach settled. I came downstairs and EMTs arrived. Took blood pressure. Result was it was low. Took EKG and that was normal. Second  blood pressure test  showed that I rebounded.  When offered I felt it unnecessary to go to hospital.

Then waves of oversensitivity with knee and foot joints hurting as if arthritis, and this lasted most of the night. I also experienced strange hallucinations in the night as if I had a high fever but I don&#39;t believe I had a fever, and I also had a migraine and neck pain. The arm where the vaccine was applied is fine and not sore at all.  I also have a slight soreness in my stomach as if I had been coughing for a while, which was not the case.  It is now 11:34 AM the following day and I believe I&#39;m getting back to my normal self but it sure was a rough night and I though you should be aware.

                                                By 10:00 pm that evening I got Chills, fever, muscle aches, headache, nausea and low back pain.  Stayed home from work for 1 or 2 days.  Felt better in all ways except my low back got very, very painful.  I asked my wife to buy me a walker to take to work because I had difficulty walking the distance from the parking lot to inside my office.  Also used the walker at work.  My boss said to go home, it looks like you&#39;re in  pain.  Saw Dr. on Monday March 15 because the low back was getting worse.  He prescribed muscle relaxors and anti-inflammatory medicine.  Called the next day asked for something stronger for pain because worse.  Nurse responded to continue on existing meds.  Went to Chiropractor on both March 16 and 18 without back pain relief.  On March 19 went to urgent care, got X-ray and pain meds.  MRI done 2 days later on March 21st which revealed a spinal abcess. Admitted to Hospital, surgery done to remove spinal abcess on March 22.  Bacteremia, laminectomies in L3,4,5 S1 to relive spinal cord pressure.  Puss had the filled spinal epidural cavity, cultured out as Strep bacteria.    Remained hospitalized until April 2nd. Sent home for 1 night then returned to hospital via ambulence the next day April 3rd with 103 degree fever.  Discharged April 8th. Readmitted to hospital for 3rd time on April 17 where I remain today with Kidney and liver function problems likely reactions to meds.  Continue to have excruciating low back back which is why continues to be hospitalized at the time of this report.

Shortly after, a few seconds, the patient stated he felt flushed and head started to fall back. Staff member cradled his head and called another staff member over.  Staff member called 9-1-1.  Patient went unconscious and his eyes rolled back for approximately 30 seconds.  When aware, we (staff members) transferred patient from the chair to the floor where staff member supported his back and fanned him due to his profuse sweating.  Staff member continued talking to him when he became unconscious again, this time gasping for air and turning pale.  We kept saying his name until he came to again and was somewhat aware of his surroundings.  He fainted one last time.  After this time, he sat up on his own and seemed to be very coherent.  The EMS arrived shortly after and took over.  They said they would take him out to check him out but he seemed to be doing better.  An EMS personnel let us know the patient did tell him that he has fainted from vaccines before.  However, he did not disclose this to us on the PQCF form or when asked verbally.

Had a 101.5 degree temperature all night which went down to 100 in the morning and back up to 101.2 later on the 14th.  I had nausea and extreme pain all over my body and restlessness.  it got a little better the next day but still feels like I have the flu. I had covid back in march of 2020 and was tested for the antibodies at the end of August.  There is a horrific dearth of research on people who have had covid and whether they should get the vaccines. It is disgraceful, and the next time I will listen to my gut which told me NOT to get vaccinated!

                                                One day after the vaccine I had extreme muscle and join pain all over body, general malaise, fever.  This lasted for about 3 days.  About 10 days post vaccine, the symptoms returned with a ferocious energy.  The pain in my muscles and joints is so severe that I can&#39;t roll over in bed, have difficulty walking, and getting on and off the toilet. It interrupts my sleep so that I play musical bed-chair-couch throughout the night.  Needless to say, it exacerbates the level of pain and fatigue I&#39;m already experiencing.  It is life debilitating as I cannot participate in my usual daily activities of walking, hiking, gardening, biking, etc.  As a result of joint and muscle stiffness, I am also now experiencing headaches. These extreme conditions have persisted from March 23- April 9...and I don&#39;t see relief in the future.

The patient&#39;s wife, reported to hospice team that he had been sleepy during the day and had received a dose of Ativan  earlier that morning (PRN medication at 0750). The primary hospice nurse reported wife noted he became more lethargic throughout the day after vaccination with his condition worsening at 1720; at that time his blood sugar levels were noted to be low at &#34;47&#34; but patient was alert enough to drink orange juice, eat ice cream. The patient continued to deteriorate so MD was consulted and he was transported to the ED where he later expired at 1930.

Symptoms at presentation were:  4 week history of post vaccine fatigue, decreased stamina, exertion related tachycardia, and dyspnea on exertion.  Patient is a regular exerciser  with a high fitness level. Exam was unrevealing. Lab testing included CBC CMP thyroid profile ESR C-reactive protein Lyme titers and D-dimer.  All were normal/negative.    The reportable lab findings were:  SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG antibody titers were zero on the initial evaluation.  Six days later SARS-COV-2 IgG, IgM, and IgA titers were done at Lab.  All titers were zero.  So 4 and 5 weeks after receiving the J &amp; J vaccine, this patient had no antibody response.  He has no underlying disease process known to me to explain this finding.  My concern is possible administration of faulty J &amp; J vaccine which may have been distributed before the manufacturing error was identified.

                                                Since March 7 (the day I got the J&amp;J shot coincidentally), I have been experiencing dizziness (lightheadedness), weakness, racing heart from time to time (very badly after I did a work out on the day of the vaccination), tingling in my feet, jitters (like having too much caffeine), fatigue, and being cold (more than usual). Things have gotten progressively worse as I now cannot walk up a flight of stairs without a racing heart and heavy breathing and extreme exhaustion. (FYI, before this I was running 4-5 miles 4-5 times a week). In addition, my doctor tells me that I have no Covid-19 protection based on blood tests.

                                                I didn&#39;t have pain in the arm, after an hour I had a slight headache. The headache lasted about a day. After the 3-4 day I had serve diarrhea and stopped taking my supplements. It stopped for a couple days then came back for a day. I had no headache or pain, just 3 bad episodes of diarrhea. On March 24th I went into the Hospital with severe pain in my lower left back side. I thought I was passing a kidney side, with the pain I was having. When I got there they did a CT scan and blood work and it wasn&#39;t kidney stone but I had a blood clot on the lower left side of lung and the right side as well. They immediate put me on blood thinners. I was there for a day and a night. They released and put me on medication.  I&#39;ve had minor pain but nothing like the pain I had before. I have since followed up with a Pomologist and PCP. Pulmonologist said I had blood clots but couldn&#39;t give me a cause. My PCP said she thought I had or have Covid. I asked to have my blood drawn and she said it was too late for that because I had taken the vaccine already.

                                                The patient called the pharmacy on 4/7/2021 and said that he had vomited and had been experiencing an excruciating headache that he said was worse than any headache he had ever had and was concerned about how he was feeling since he had just had his Covid vaccine on Monday.  I told him that headaches were a very common adverse reaction and that many people had experienced headaches after vaccination.  I told him that from my experience it usually didn&#39;t last more than a day for others and I assured him that it should go away soon.  I later talked to him and found out that he had went to the Emergency room that Wednesday evening (4/7/2021) because the headache was so bad.  He was seen in the ER, observed overnight, released the next morning, and then had a follow up appointment with his primary care physician on 4/15/2021.  He also had a very high blood pressure reading he told me in the Emergency room that evening he was evaluated.

I developed chills, fever, headache, neck aches, malaise and extreme fatigue that lasted 12 days and then resolved for the most part except still experiencing some fatigue. I was concerned because I was expecting side effect shortly after the vaccine however the symptoms were very much delayed. Although I have been very isolated before and after the vaccine I grew concerned I may have been exposed to COVID though highly unlikely and got a PCR covid test which came back negative

                                                On Thursday, March 18, I had some slight dizziness during the day. After going to bed that night I woke up and the night light in the smoke alarm on the ceiling appeared to be spinning. I sat, then stood, grabbling walls for support and attempted to reach my recliner. At that point I was severely dizzy, completely lost any sense of balance and collapsed into the chair. I could not stand or walk. After 20 minutes, I asked my wife to call an ambulance. I did not think she would be able to get me into our car. The paramedics ran an EKG and tested me for a stroke. Both were normal. I was transported to the ER. The doctor gave me Meclizine. Had a CT scan of my brain, and blood work. All results normal. Dizziness resolved. They tested my balance and then released me at 3:30 a.m. on March 19. I was tired that day, but did not need further medication. During that night, as I turned over in bed, the vertigo returned. I took a Meclizine and went to the recliner for the remainder of the night. I am feeling somewhat fuzzy today, March 20. Not sure how long this will continue, or if it is related to my Covid vaccination. However, I am reporting it in the event that others may be experiencing this problem as well.

The next day I was still cold.  I didn?t feel better until the next day.  I am still blotchy.

                                                No pain at injection site nor abnormal symptoms that day (Friday) Next day (Saturday) had general body aches and light chills but no fever and slept all day on the couch On the second day (Sunday) felt ok again except did not sleep well the night before Monday felt agitated and could not sit still: I had to be &#34;doing something&#34; to feel like I wasn&#39;t going crazy, slept very poorly that night or the prior night Symptoms described above worsened each day and night up until today.  I have slept very little each night and because I have to be &#34;doing something&#34; I am worn out by late in the day. Yesterday (Tuesday 4/20/2021) I felt a little better and slept reasonably well last night.  Today I am feeling restless and agitated again but not as severe as it was earlier....

During the day, while ambulatory, vertical or sitting, my breathing is normal.  As soon as, immediately, when I get into bed for sleep, my breathing is immediately restricted so I cannot maintain lying down.  I have to sit up.  I can&#39;t sleep.  I get exhausted by 3-4-5 a.m. and finally am so distressed I sleep in a sitting up position or catch a snippet of sleep up to an hour or so.  Often wake up with panic attack of suffocating, sit up, jump out of bed, get vertical.

                                                It started with a familiar reaction and that was I had tingling and pain in my feet it started with both feet and it was significant, like when the feet goes to sleep and it is coming back and you feel the pins and needles feeling, and it was exactly what I get with CIDP. It moved from both feet up to both hands and I was not really afraid because that is what happens with CIDP when your auto immune system is stimulated. I get numbness on my feet and in my hands. I thought that the vaccine stimulated my immune system. The CIDP has been in remission and maybe the shot has stimulated my nervous system.  The other day I noticed that when taking the hot plate from the microwave it was hot but I did not feel it at all. I thought the food has not heated up, when my wife touched the plate she said it was very hot and I did not feel the plate hot at all. I also felt pain in my left foot to a point that I am not ambulatory. The pain is so extreme in my left foot if I try to stand up. I have been in my bed for the last 2 days. I am not sure if it is the CIDP or GOUT that is attacking my foot but it has been triggered by the vaccine. I also have severe pain in my left leg. I called my cardiologist and I have a phone consultation with him today to check for clot formation. The pain has subsided a bit today, but yesterday the pain in my leg was very intense. I also had pain at the injection site and felt a little feverish since yesterday around 3PM and it went to 101F and this morning I am fine again. I did not take anything for it and this morning I woke up and I felt well (in regards to the fever). I did not have fever before then.

                                                Beginning about 10 days after vaccination, the patient noticed pain in his arm and he started ?not feeling so great.? Over several days, this pain began to radiate and involve muscle and bone aches. He continued to feel ill to what he described as the worst symptoms on Monday, April 26th, which included severe pain, high blood pressure (211/113 documented by the ER), symptoms similar to cardiac event. The patient was seen by Emergency Department who did not find a diagnosis, but gave the patient medication to lower blood pressure and referred further treatment to his Primary Care Provider.  Blood pressure mediation was taken to lower his blood pressure and clonidine 0.1mg was prescribed by his PCP because of elevated BP (over 150/90). The patient was also instructed to take Advil for pain and was referred to get an X-ray  with follow up in 2 weeks on 5/13.
