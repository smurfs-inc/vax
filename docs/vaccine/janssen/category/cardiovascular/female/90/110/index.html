The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included atrial fibrillation. The patient received COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: Unknown) dose was not reported, administered on 2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. It was reported that on an unspecified date in 2021 the patient received Janssen Covid-19 Vaccine and within 6hrs she had a major atrial fibrillation episode, then several the following day. The next day, she lost her ability to swallow. Two days later she was on oxygen. Three days later she developed a blood clot in her right arm, was still on oxygen and blood pressure was falling. On an unspecified date, the patient died 4 days after receiving vaccine. The action taken with COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S was not applicable. The patient died 4 days after receiving vaccine on an unspecified date, and the outcome of atrial fibrillation, inability to swallow, blood clot in right arm and low blood pressure was not reported. This report was serious (Death, Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: 20210400509: This spontaneous report received from a vaccine facility via a company representative involved a 95-year-old female with the past medical history remarkable for atrial fibrillation who received the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine for prevention of COVID-19 infection and within 6hrs had a major atrial fibrillation episode. No concomitant medications were reported. The next day, she lost her ability to swallow. Two days later she was on oxygen. Three days later she developed a blood clot in her right arm, was still on oxygen and blood pressure was falling. On an unspecified date, the patient died 4 days after receiving vaccine. No information was provided regarding the cause of death.  Considering the patient&#39;s past medical history of atrial fibrillation, the causality for the event of atrial fibrillation, as well the consequent events is assessed not related to the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: DEATH 4 DAYS AFTER RECEIVING VACCINE

                                                Received a Janssen vaccination on 4/7/21 from a home visiting nurse from the County Health Department. On approximately 4/13/21, the family noticed slight signs of an issue, with patient slumping towards the right, and showing some signs of weakness on right side of body. Family contacted the PCP,  who advised to take her to the ED. Family was hesitant to do that because patient had been bedridden for past few years. She seemed to improve somewhat on 4/15/21. Then the morning of 4/16/21, the family found her on the floor of her bedroom. She appeared to have had a moderate to severe stroke. Right side of body paralyzed, cannot speak. Uncertain whether mental faculties further deteriorated. PCP ordered a hospice facility for care. Stroke likely caused by blood clot but unsure if related to JJ vaccine. She has not been evaluated in person by her health care providers.
