I then started to have stroke like symptoms. I looked at my friends and stated that I did not know their names. I went to a walk-in clinic and then I was hospitalized for three days. My blood pressure was extremely high. All of the tests were negative for stroke and I have worn a Holter monitor. I also had Neurology, Cardiologist consult and many different medications. I have stopped taking all of those medications. I have not had any more symptoms like that since that day and it only lasted less than 15 minutes.

                                                My mother reported feeling numbness/tingling in her left fingers/hand on the drive home approximately 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  She wanted to go straight home.  When we got home she reported that the numbness had been felt in her head and tongue and it was a very weird feeling.  She was numb on her entire left side.  It seemed to resolve after a while.  She is still very tired and has a low heart rate, but normal blood oxygenation.  There is no visible swelling or reaction at the vaccine site. She still has some slight numbness on the left side.  She may call the doctor tomorrow if there is still some concern.

She stood up got dizzy and seamed to have a seizure.  when she came to she did not know that it had happened.  about 5 hours later she stood up again got dizzy and seamed to have had another seizure.  her husband called 911.   EMTs took her vitals but did not detect anything to be wrong at the time and was advised to see PCP.    Next day 3/12/21 she went to her PCP.  She had blood work which showed high enzymes for heart failure so was sent to hospital to be admitted.  Pt had blood work, chest xray which showed blood clots in both lungs.  She was administered blood thinner.  MRI of head was clear. Echocardiogram was clear.  Pt stayed about 4 days.  Enzymes for heart failure was clearing up.  Pt was released and had a FU appt w/ PCP on 3/22/21.  Pt found out that she also had bilateral deep vein thrombosis in both legs while she was in the hospital. Pt is improving and is almost back to normal.

History of hypertension, CHF, obesity, chronic kidney disease, and back pain. Work up included multiple consults. The patient was placed on SQ heparin for VTE prophylaxis. Acute L5 fracture was found along with emphysematous changes. Neurosurgical evaluation- no surgery was necessary. During the first 24 hours (before receiving the vaccine), the patient&#39;s Hg dropped 9.3 to 6.8 and platelets dropped 130K to 61 K with no apparent bleeding source.  PRBC transfusion was given. GI consult was obtained the patient was scheduled to have EGD the following morning (day 3). Cardiology was obtained for elevated troponin and hypoxia. An echo obtained on day 2 showed moderate elevated pulmonary artery pressure, mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and normal sized right atrium and ventricle. The patient received the Janssen vaccine upon request the morning of hospital day 2 (4.1.21 at 11:02). At 11:37PM on 4/1/21 the patient received 5mg IV metoprolol for elevated HR of 132 (BP 129/67). At 0128 on 4/2/21 the patient&#39;s heart rate dropped into the 60&#39;s and then declined further requiring cardiac resuscitation. The attempt was unsuccessful and the patient expired at 01:43 on 4/2/21. An autopsy was conducted (results available on 4/13/21) showed a 4 cm clot in the patient&#39;s right atrium and a mural thrombus in her femoral artery.

The patient&#39;s height was 166 inches and weight was 138 pounds. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included white coat hypertension, asthma, severe allergy to codeine, abstain from alcohol, and non-smoker. The patient was not pregnant.  The patient received vaccination with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2. s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 1805020, and expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 02-APR-2021 09:00 in left arm as prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included estradiol.  The patient reported that about 15-20 minutes post-vaccination on 02-APR-2021 as she was waiting in waiting area of vaccination clinic, she started to get bad chest pain which was in the center of her chest. She experienced heavy pressure in her chest. No arm pain or sensation was reported other than her chest. The patient further explained that she could feel that her heart &#39;wasn&#39;t beating right&#39; and reported as &#39;heart feeling wonky&#39;. The patient felt the top of her heart beating faster than the bottom. The vaccination paramedic took her blood pressure which was 212 (patient did not have any other information on her blood pressure). The paramedics called ambulance and after a 15 minute drive patient arrived at emergency room at 9.30. The patient had an echocardiogram or &#39;an ultrasound&#39; of her heart and was told that it was not functioning properly that her ventricle was functioning at 40% of normal. The patient was put on nitroglycerin and heparin drip. Blood test was also done which showed troponin levels at 113 or 116, &#39;somewhere in there&#39;. The patient was told that &#39;some type of cardiac event had occurred&#39;.  The patient&#39;s tests were reviewed same night and patient spent the night in emergency room because there were no beds. On 03-APR-2021, the patient was transferred to a hospital where she was put on nitroglycerin and heparin drip. The patient was moved again to another hospital on night of 04-APR-2021. The patient had angiogram and CT of vein and arteries. No clot was found by that time. The patient was discharged on 06-APR-2021. The patient saw a cardiologist on 15-APR-2021 who told patient that &#39;he thought she had some kind of clot that dissolved in the hospital&#39;. Since patient has been home, she experienced pain and discomfort in arm and wrist with cellulitis in her wrist. The patient was taking cephalexin 500 mg three times a day for 10 days. The patient said it was due to angiogram she had because the angiogram team had hard time with her angiogram and had to go in twice. The patient had been taking percocet 5 mg tablet as needed for pain. The patient attempted to report these events online and left a message for someone to call her back but email did not work as she was unable to send.  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of bad chest pains, pain in center of chest, feeling of heart not beating right and blood pressure of 212, and cellulitis in her wrist was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 78-year-old white (non-Hispanic/Latino) female patient was hospitalized for chest pain, palpitations, and blood pressure of 212 within the hour of receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  Concurrent illness included white coat hypertension, asthma, severe allergy to codeine; denies smoking and have abstained from alcohol.  The patient complained of &#34;bad chest pain&#34; described as heavy pressure on the chest and that she could feel her &#34;heart was not beating right/heart feeling wonky/top of her heart beating faster than the bottom&#34;.  Blood pressure was 212 when it was checked, the patient was transported to the emergency room where echocardiogram showed that her ventricle was functioning at 40% of normal; Troponin was 113 (or 116).  The patient was started on nitroglycerin and heparin drip.  CT Angiogram of veins and arteries done 2 days after the vaccination showed no clot; by the attending cardiologist thought that some kind of clot might have been dissolved. Due to difficulty of doing the angiogram, the patient had cellulitis in her wrist with pain and discomfort in arm and wrist; the patient was taking cephalexin and percocet for the cellulitis and pain.   No other details reported.  The short latency and the advanced age confounded the event.  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

Patient states she has been on the ground in the room for 3 days, she was found covered in feces.  Alert and oriented x4 however intermittently appears confused and has varying history.  She does not know how she got on the ground, however denies fall or syncope.  No significant current complaints.  Slightly tachycardic and febrile, slightly hypertensive, exam without any significant acute findings, no obvious skin source of ulcer or infection, no focal neurological deficits, no pain.  Initiated aggressive fluid hydration and sepsis work-up.  EKG appears normal with no signs of ischemia or arrhythmia.  Labs show slightly elevated troponin, low magnesium, metabolic/lactic acidosis.  VBG relatively normal.  Urine negative for infection chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia, no clinical signs or symptoms to identify source of infection.  Nothing to suggest meningitis at this time.  CT head is negative.  Unclear source of fever however empirically treated with antibiotics and fluids.  Patient remains hemodynamically stable with no hypotension.  She did arrive slightly hypoxic and with increased respiratory rate however clear lung sounds and no indications of heart failure, COPD/asthma.  CT chest without evidence of pulmonary embolism, focal pneumonia, or fluid overload.  Respiratory status possibly related to compensation for metabolic acidosis that is likely due to lack of fluid intake due to being on the ground.  CK is normal and kidney function is normal.  Consulted medicine for admission for further evaluation and treatment.  Cardiology was also consulted for NSTEMI, agrees with current plan.   per H&amp;P 4/28/21:   Altered mental status (R41.82): Etiology is not clear. Patient states she had J&amp;J Covid vaccine about 3 weeks ago. Need to rule out cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Get a CT scan of the brain with contrast. If negative will get CT venogram or MRV and MRI of the head. Neuro checks. Request PT OT and speech therapy evaluation. Check urine drug screen. Check blood alcohol level.    Non-STEMI (non-ST elevated myocardial infarction) (I21.4): Start argatroban drip until cerebral vein sinus thrombosis is excluded then we can switch to heparin drip. Start aspirin and statin.

Follow up on blood cultures.   CT chest negative for infectious process. Check CT of the abdomen and pelvis.Start empiric antibiotics: Vancomycin and Zosyn.    Hypomagnesemia (E83.42): Administer magnesium sulfate. Repeat level in the morning.    Diabetes (E11.9): Start sliding scale insulin. Monitor fingersticks. Hypoglycemic protocol.  Check hemoglobin A1c.    Hypertension (I10): Fortunately patient is hemodynamically stable. We will cautiously start metoprolol. Adjust antihypertensives to optimal blood pressure control.

Left with no issues.  had been to see her MD that morning for routine visit and everything was fine.   04-02-2021: No issues  - felt fine.  Went shopping and out to eat.  Was a bit tired that evening.  Son left her home at 6pm and all was good. 04-03-2021: son text her in the morning and no answer.  Thought she might be in the shower and text again and no answer.  He called her and no answer, so he went over and found her non-responsive laying on her back on her bed with the same clothes she left her with the prior evening.  sheriff&#39;s office pronounced her dead on 04-03-2021 with what appeared to have been a  heart attack.

                                                Patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of hypothyroidism, hypertension, and osteoarthritis who presented from home complaining of 4 days left shoulder pain that radiates into her left pectoral area.  She states she was vaccinated with the Janssen Covid vaccine on 4/8/21 in her left shoulder and her pain started 4/23/21.  She is not sure if these were related.  It was initially intermittent, sharp, stabbing, however became fairly persistent.  She has noted her blood pressure being elevated.  On my evaluation her blood pressure is 185/64.  Patient states she was recently started on lisinopril for hypertension.  She has not taken her lisinopril yet today. Chest x-ray showed no obvious infiltrates.  Clear lung fields.  Normal cardiac dimensions. EKG shows sinus mechanism with normal axis, intervals, ST segments.  Otherwise normal EKG. D dimer was elevated, and VQ scan was negative for PE. Patient was evaluated by Cardiology who recommended outpatient stress test. Echo showed LVEF 60-65%. Trace aortic valve regurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation. Mild mitral leaflet calcification is visualized. Trace tricuspid regurgitation. The right ventricular systolic pressure is calculated at 28mmHg. Patient was found to have hyperlipidemia and was started on statin. Her pain resolved on the day of discharge. Her blood pressure was controlled with lisinopril and coreg. She is to follow up with Cardiology and her PCP.

Visited primary doctor who urged her to visit ED. On ED visit on 3/4/21, she was found to be in afib RVR (heart rate to 170s) that was refractory initially to dilt push, dilt oral, dilt gtt. On 3/7/21, stroke alert was called because of new right arm dis-coordination, and on 3/8/21, MR brain showed an acute right cerebellar artery infarct (which did not leave deficits). Prior to the vaccine, pt had absolutely no symptoms of heart failure or cardiac diagnoses. She was hospitalized from 3/4/21-3/13/21, 3/18/21-3/23/21 for afib RVR, congestive heart failure, and acute kidney injury which required dilt and diuretics. However, she was later hospitalized on 4/8/21-4/11/21 again for afib RVR, congestive heart failure and acute kidney injury. Finally after continued outpatient amiodarone, she returned to normal sinus rhythm.
