Her symptoms included dizziness, syncope, stomach ache, foaming at the mouth, vision disturbances.  911 was called and paramedics arrived..  Her vital signs were all normal.  Patient did not wish to go to hospital, and her mother took her home.  Other pertinent information is that patient has a history of seizures and had been off of her seizure medication for 4 weeks.  I believe that I understood her mother to say that her neurologist knew she was getting the vaccine today.  Patient reported no allergies to any other vaccine, medication, or other.

                                                I got the vaccine at 3:45 arm was sore but I wasn?t worried Later that night around 6 I started feeling disgusting from vaccine so I took an Advil.  Around 8-10pm my body started getting chills, I started shaking, I had a headache my muscles were sore, and I started getting a fever. Around 12am all of the previous symptoms got worse my fever was at about 101 and rising and I was extremely tired. At 1am I felt the worst I have ever felt in my entire life. I could barely walk because my muscles and joints hurt and my fever was over 102.5 and I felt like my veins were on fire. At 2 am I moved to my bathroom because the floor was cold and I didn?t want my roommate seeing me cry from how much pain I was in. I have a high pain tolerance but this was the worst pain I?ve ever been in. In the bathroom I was at the peak of the pain of the vaccine. My fever was over 103 all of my previous side effects were worse than ever I felt weak and a little dizzy. I also was having a hard time breathing, my breathing was weak and I felt like I wasn?t getting enough air. I tried looking up on my phone if I should go to the hospital but I could barely pick up my phone to type or look. I dropped my phone and fell asleep in the floor for 20 minutes before I woke up. I walked slowly over to my bed and took a Tylenol and then had a sip of water and felt like I was going to puke. I tried to use my inhaler and I couldn?t hold my breath to use it. I crawled into bed and slept until 11 the next day and was too sore to walk to class all of my joints still hurt and I had a fever of 101 and a headache . I took a Tylenol and around 6pm my fever broke and I was feeling better. The next day I was still too sore to walk to class and had a headache. Today I am still sore but better my lungs still feel a little tight, I feel unfocused , and I still feel dizzy occasionally. I have no appetite and I feel nauseous when I eat so I?ve been eating in smaller portions . Every single day since the shot I?ve felt very tired. I hope these symptoms get better and Looking back on the night of vaccine I should have gone to the hospital.

                                                Around 5:00 PM the day I got the shot I started to get a slight headache. Shortly after the headache appeared I started to get the chills, I was wrapped up in multiple blankets and started shaking uncontrollably. I then checked my temperature and at this time it was 100.3. I then ate dinner and decided to try and fall asleep. When I lied down my heart began to beat very fast. I tracked my heart rate via a watch and my resting heart rate was around 140 bpm. My fever had also increased to 102. My head ache continued to get worse and I began to have bad neck and lower back pains. I was also having muscle spasm in my calfs. The entire night I could barely sleep because of my high heart rate, body aches, shakes, and the constant change from freezing cold to hot and sweating.

Within a minute, her skin color became pinkish, and breathing was detected.  She became aware of her environment.  While we waited for the paramedics, her breathing and skin came back to normal.  She reported of no breakfast or lunch before getting the vaccine.  We gave her some chocolate and water.  Her family later reported that she passed out after a flu shot a few years back.  Her family refused to take her to hospital after the paramedic&#39;s advice.

                                                She felt totally fine after the shot and many hours after.  She felt fine to go to a horseback ride lesson at 4.  Half way through the lesson she acutely felt like she was going to faint/nauseous (she had a ton to eat that day, had a bottle of water just before lesson, etc. so she knew it wasnt those kinds of things) and then had a crushing headache with a lot of &#34;pressure behind her eyes&#34;, dizziness, and a really &#34;strange&#34; feeling like out of body, bawling crying, and started FREEZING.  I got there 15 minutes later and she was under lots of blankets, white as a sheet, freezing, said her spine was sore from the top to bottom... just tons of symptoms.  When I got her, she moved to my car and had seat heater on high and I had to put all the clothes from a suitcase I had in my car on top of her bc she was so cold and her skin was burning up.  I gave her 3 200 advil and a bottle of water.  ½ hour later i had a thermometer and even after that she still had 102.3 fever.  She was rambling some nonsense and seemed very disoriented for a while. She went straight to shower and laid on the floor of the shower for ½ hour, took cold medicine, and evnetually went to sleep.  In the night she was freezing again and the fever had spiked and she took more advil.  The next day she felt much better in the morning and fine by lunchtime.  She was VERY sick/uncomfortable with basically every symptom under the sun.

We gave her no food or drink, took her blood pressure and stayed with her. She then fainted again at which point we called for a paramedic. They evaluated her and took her blood pressure again and her blood sugar. She then recovered and walked out of the store unassisted. She did not go to the ER but chose to go to an urgent care center I believe.

She was feeling fine up until around 10:00 that night when she began to have some of the regular side effects in addition to some unusual ones that were more concerning.  She had chills was feverish and nauseous with flu like symptoms of her body aching.  However, at around 10:30 that night she reported having difficulty breathing and having chest pains with pain when she would take breaths. She noticeably was taking very small but frequent breaths due to the pain. She described a pressure on her chest as if there was a bowling ball sitting on top of her chest. She was crying from the pain and her difficulty breathing. She also reported that her throat felt like it was smaller/ constricted.    At that time, she was given Acetaminophen and later around 12:00 she was given Benadryl.  When she went to bed that night, she was in pain but she also reported that her heart was racing and her resting pulse at the time was 110 bpm. She had the flu like symptoms into Thursday evening but by Friday she looked a lot better except for her difficulty breathing with complaints of chest pain when she breaths with continued pressure on her chest.  She rested in bed for most of Friday and on Saturday she got dressed in the afternoon and took a walk around half a mile at which time she was exhausted and felt out of breath.  When she walked back from her destination about a half mile, she needed to rest in bed to recuperate.  The pain while breathing lasted into Sunday. Monday morning, she attempted to run and became winded from running a short distance of ¼ of the block and could not catch her breath having difficulty breathing and throwing up with a lot of subsequent chest pain that day. She was taken to the doctor by 10:00 that morning to run lab tests and get an examination.  She is slowly getting better and taking it easy but Tuesday she still had some pain and by Thursday she is reporting that while the chest pain is still there it is more of a discomfort that she feels when breathing as compared to pain.  She continues to report the discomfort when breathing till today 4/16/21 and is still limiting her physical activity but going about her daily routine.

I monitored her blood several times and it was normal.  Over the course of 30-40 minutes she recovered and left the pharmacy.

About eight hours after injection, a fever and fast heartbeat accompanied by chills began and persisted for about twelve hours. A few mild and extremely brief feelings of nausea were present as well. After taking Tylenol six hours in, the symptoms started improving and were gone after seven hours. Feelings of tiredness were present for about two days after the first symptoms showed up.

                                                Adminstered vaccine at 12 noon. At roughly 12:03pm the patient started experiencing signs of syncope. She had pale blue lips, ringing in ears, changes in vision/blurry vision, she felt dizzy/light headed. The symptoms began improving at roughly 12:10 and had almost completely resolved by 12:15. I kept the patient for an additional 15 minutes for monitoring. I counseled patient on what to do if they felt as though they were going to pass out. I provided a cold compress for the back of the patient&#39;s neck, and had ammonia inhalant on standby but didn&#39;t have to use to help keep patient conscious.  By 12:30 the patient was feeling completely normal again. Her mom/stepmom was with her and was able to drive her home. I asked them to reach out in case of any other symptoms developed.

She came to within a minute and was aware of her surroundings.  She stated she felt ok but her head hurt from hitting the floor.  We gave her an ice pack for her head.  After about 5 minutes  she got back in the chair and was here until EMS arrived.  While they were there questioning her she lost consciousness again two separate times and displayed potential seizure activity again. They put her on the stretcher and took her to the hospital.  She reported she has not had seizures in the past but has fainted from a vaccination in the past but was younger and received 3 immunizations.

I couldn&#39;t get a reading on the BP monitor at that time as it was too low to read and she couldn&#39;t move her limbs. While waiting  for EMS she could breathe fine, I could feel a faint pulse, but I had to keep taping her leg and talking to her to keep her awake. She was able to tell us her name and how many fingers I was holding up. I kept trying to get her to squeeze my hand, but I could only feel the tips of her fingers twitching and the whole time she was unable to move her feet/toes. I was able to look at her HR on her watch right before EMS arrived and it was at 62 and by that time her body temp seemed to be back to normal as her Mom said she felt cool and clammy. The BP reading by EMS was 100/60 and they tried to get her to stand but she couldn&#39;t and she still kept wanting to roll her head back and sleep.

                                                I began to have a high heart rate about hours after getting the shot then a fever came along and I had chills, and my lips were dry and I also had a headache. My heart rate  would barely stay below 100 BPM, even when laying down in bed. I developed a 102 F fever last night and took motrin, which helped lower it but I?ve also been having lingering throbbing headaches. My heart rate went to about 100-105 when while I took a nap but as soon as I got up and moved it jumped to 117, in the morning I went to use the bathroom and did nothing else and just that made it jump to 160. I have no trouble breathing. I was sitting in bed eating and my heart rate was around 123-130

When observing her, she appeared like she was going to fall over so I had her mom help me put her on her back. 911 was called and I took her blood pressure and it was 80/49 mmHg. She remained conscious and EMS took her to ED for observation. She was given liquids, discharged and told to come back if she had any other symptoms. Per her mother, she had not ate or drank anything prior to receiving the shot.

When I was called to help her, she had fainted.  She was able to slowly respond to us and was breathing.   We placed her on the floor laying on her side.  A cold compress was placed on the back of her neck and a pillow was placed under her head.  9-1-1 was called.  When EMS responded, she had normal blood pressure and blood sugar, but was still feeling &#34;out of it&#34;.  She was place on a stretcher and taken to the ambulance, but did not get transported.  She had a family member pick her up from the clinic.  She was able to walk from the ambulance to the car on her own.

After about 5 minutes I checked on her and she said she was feeling very dizzy.  I called management for assistance and got her ice packs for neck and forehead. I took her blood pressure and it was 150/90, HR 73. We laid her down and elevated her legs.  She said that she felt some pressure in her chest but she had pulled a muscle there the day before and wasn&#39;t sure if it was related.  She said the room was spinning as she continued to lay on the ground and it was not improving.  Her blood pressure was taken about 5 minutes later and it was 143/85 HR 73.  She said it is usually low.   She had no signs of local reaction, hives, or swelling.  She complained of nausea.  After a few more minutes she said she was not feeling any better and was having pain in her throat and difficulty breathing.  I asked her to try to take a deep breath and she was gasping for air, unable to breathe deeply.  I administered epinephrine (one dose) and called 911.  I rechecked blood pressure while waiting for paramedics and it was 125/80.  She was taken to hospital when they arrived.  Her mom arrived shortly before the ambulance and went with her.  Pt never lost consciousness.  Management followed up with patient this evening and patient is home and well, but the ER did classify the event as an allergic reaction.

I tried falling asleep but my fever got worse, chills worsened, I developed body aches, and I got a massive headache. I ended up not being able to get any sleep at all during the entire night because I was in so much pain. I felt tightness in my chest, stomach pains, super sore joints, and my body aches and headache kept getting worse and worse. When I got up to go use the bathroom I could barely walk because I felt so weak and was super dizzy. Later into the night my legs felt like pins and needles as if they were starting to go numb. I still have a fever, body aches, and a headache.

I couldn&#39;t breathe, and I started coughing every time I took a deep breath. My entire body ached and I had stabbing pains in my abdomen. This was the worst pain I had ever felt in my life.

                                                About 3-4 minutes after I vaccinated the patient, while she was in the 15 min observation seat, she lost consciousness, her fiance caught her from falling out of her chair. I ran over, and as soon as I got there she started to convulse, therefore appeared to be having a seizure. I help her fiance get her onto the ground safely and placed her on her side, then called for my tech to call 911. The seizure/convulsions only seemed to last 10-15 seconds. She then came to, and was disoriented. Then she felt nausous, and threw up a small amount. The paramedics arrived, checked her out. She said she was felt fine, and refused to go with them to the hospital.

Patient went outside and was evaluated further in the ambulance but was not willing to go to the ER.

My friend told me that my forehead was puffy (swollen). I laid down and I realized I was really really cold but skin was hot to touch. I think I had a fever.  I was shaky and shivery and trembling. I tried to take a nap. Fell asleep for an hour - don&#39;t remember that time at all - but my friend told me I went to sleep. My smart watch was telling me my heart rate was 120s and 130s while I was sleeping. I debated whether I should go to the Dr. and I called the school police and they took me to the ER   - at 03:00 am on the 8th - and they told me to rest for  day and wait it out. I still feel like I have a lot of adrenaline - my watch says that my heart rate is way to high for what I&#39;m doing. It&#39;s usually in 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s but it&#39;s in the 120&#39;s and 130&#39;s every day and I am really shaky with adrenaline. I have had a headache since Wednesday night and it hasn&#39;t gone away. If it goes past Wednesday, I will go to my primary care doctor but otherwise no treatment at this time.

                                                About 4 hours after the injection I began to feel extremely tired and took a nap for a couple of hours. When I woke up at 5 pm I noticed body aches and chills, and a migraine that would get substantially worse and became throbbing when I would sit up or stand. After taking some Tylenol (300 mg) I thought I was able to walk for small periods or time (aka walk to the bathroom) but I fainted on the way back

                                                On 4/8/2021 I developed a headache after receiving the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I took the next few days easy, and laid in bed for the majority of the weekend. On 4/10/2021 I left my residence to get dinner and noticed I was short of breath just walking from the building to my car. The shortness of breath worsened over the next few days. On 4/13/2021 I called a clinic and told them I had been short of breath and they directed me to the ER. I arrived to the ER around 2:30 in the afternoon. They ordered a chest x-ray and ran a test to determine if I could have a blood clot. The test came back with results indicating I could have a blood clot, so they did a chest CT and an MRI. The chest CT showed a blood clot in my left pulmonary artery. They prescribed a blood thinner, told me to stop taking oral birth control, and discharged me.

                                                Patient received her vaccine with 2 family members in the room who also got the vaccine. Moments after (less than 2 minutes) giving her the vaccine, I was giving another family member the injection and patient asked if she could take her mask off. I turned around and she was very pale. She took her mask off and started slumping in her seat. She was taking deep breaths and reported no difficulties breathing. She then became ill and began gagging, at which point I gave her the trash receptacle to vomit in. I had a technician grab the patient a water and packet of crackers. After half an hour of resting in the chair, monitoring her breathing, blood pressure, heart rate, and getting some food and water into her system, she appeared and reported to feel back to normal. Patient&#39;s family member mentioned she had a similar reaction a few weeks ago when getting blood drawn at her doctor&#39;s office.

I went to the walk in clinic at CVS on Saturday because I was still feeling fatigue, headache, nose bleeds (I was having them before the vaccine about a week before) and sinus congestion, they antibiotics and I was able to get started on them on the same day. I still feel the fatigue, congestion and the sinus pressure/headache. The fever and chills are gone.

                                                At 4:00pm I got lightheaded, dizzy, and achy. The lightheadedness was such that my heart was pounding, vision was lost for a second (similar to the effect when you stand up too fast), and the sound went out for a second. Around 7:00 I got chills, a 101 degree F fever, and headache. The chills, fever, and headache lasted throughout the night, but they were gone in the morning. The entire day after getting the vaccine, 4/1/2021, I had a metallic taste in my mouth. By the morning of 4/2/2021 the metallic taste was gone.

We called 9-1-1 to check vitals and they recommended going to her doctor or the hospital in case of additional swelling.  We called the doctor and they told us to try Benadryl.  This worked a little bit, but she is still in a lot of discomfort today (Saturday after Thursday shot).

                                                Patient was given the injection and then she started feeling dizzy right after administration.  She sat with her head against the wall and dropped her phone and passed out for just a moment.  She had a slight tremor/shake for a few seconds. (I did not witness, unsure exactly what happened or how long)   She came too fairly quickly after being yelled at, are you ok?  When she regained consciousness she complained of being hot all over for a bit.  We gave her ice packs to cool down.  She felt hot for maybe 10-15 minutes, but felt relief with the ice packs.  She also drank some sips of cool water which seemed to help her cool down.

                                                It started with my teeth chattering and chills, but no fever yet. All of the muscles in my body had a severe tremor, and I had trouble with simple tasks like filling my nasal rinse bottle, because the tremor was so bad. My jaw was smacking the entire time, so hard that the headboard smacked against the blinds. Then I checked my temperature and it had gone from 97.5 to about 99.5. The symptoms got worse, and added in excessive thirst, pain at the base of my head where it meets my neck, pressure under and behind the eyes, severe lower back pain, muscle pain escalating on the right side of my body only, nausea, pain across the top of my forehead, and a weird heat sensation under my fingernails? Maybe and hour or so passed, and my fever rose to above 101, and I tried to go back to sleep. By this point the tremors were over, but slight chills and every other symptoms remained. I took my temp later and it was 102.7, and I again had all symptoms except the initial tremors. I also had tachycardia (super rapid heartbeat) and got dizzy for a second and have a little trouble focusing my vision when I sat up in bed.

                                                I began feeling a migraine at 3pm. I took a nap and woke up at 6pm feeling extremely ill. My temperature was 101.5F and my entire body was in pain. I took two Tylenol as suggested. Over the course of the entire evening, I was vomiting profusely; I vomited approximately 10 times. By around 10pm my extremities became numb and I could not walk without assistance. I could not think or speak straight. I nearly fainted every time I tried to sit up. I tried to take ondansetron for vomiting but proceeded to vomit the medication as well. I wanted to go in to the ER because I felt like I was dying, but I do not feel financially comfortable doing so. All symptoms remained consistent until about 3am when I was able to sleep until 7am. I woke up with several bouts of diarrhea, intense nausea, and head to toe muscle and joint pains, as well as numbness and tingling in my arms and legs still. It is now 5pm the next day and I still can&#39;t eat or stand for too long without feeling faint. I still have diarrhea and strong migraine.

                                                I was in the passenger seat while my mom was driving me home after vaccination, and I began to feel nauseous a few minutes into the drive. About ten to fifteen minutes after we left (in total, about 25-30 minutes post-vaccination) I felt so sick (nausea, sweating, chills) that I couldn&#39;t keep my head up. I briefly fainted, but I woke up about two minutes later. My mom finished driving me home, and my condition improved with rest over the following hours.

I had migraines, fever of 101, chills, nausea, tightness of chest, abdominal pain, difficulty with my stool / bowl movements, and body aches.  I could not move, and most effects subsided after laying in bed for two/three days straight. However, continuing up to today (three weeks later) I have still had tightness of chest/throat, bowl difficulties, and abdominal pain. I also noticed that for the past 2/3 weeks I have also had blood spotting with clots alongside my abdominal pain. It has not yet subsided.

                                                Started out with a headache and dizziness within a few minutes of the vaccine, along with nausea. I stayed put laying down with a lollipop and water bottle along with ice packs on me for about an hour until I was well enough they thought for me to drive back to my dorm. Once I started driving the headache was back but I was driving so I couldn?t do much. Almost pulled over because I was getting over whelmed but ended up making it back to my dorm. Once I got back I changed and laid down in bed hoping to fell better. Things started getting worse from there. Throughout the rest of the day my head ache and dizziness got worse to the point where I was pretty unsteady on my feet. Chills and body aches also started and progressed rapidly despite no fever.  My nausea was present in waves but eventually dissipated around 8 PM.  I tried to go to bed around 11 hoping to sleep off the symptoms. I began tossing and turning. My chills were really bad and it got to the point where my skin was so sensitive that the clothes I was wearing touching and rubbing against my skin were hurting me. I was so dizzy and light headed to the point where it didn?t matter if I was laying down or sitting up, I felt the same, extremely dizzy and lightheaded as if cotton were in my brain or as if it were working too slow. It was like trying to process thoughts through molasses. Then around 1:30 I couldn?t take it anymore and thought maybe a quick shower would help me to at least feel better so I could sleep. When I got in the shower I immediately knew things were worse.  My vision started going black at the edges and black spots in the middle to the point where at certain moments I couldn?t see. I was fighting to stay on my feet and conscious and it was hurting to breathe. I knew I needed to get help so I stumbled to my dorm and collapsed when I got in the doorway to my room. My vision was spotty, my chest was hurting and I could barely breathe.  My hands and feet went numb as well, I was shivering, and my body temperature was a little down to about 98.1 degrees Fahrenheit.   I was transported to a hospital via ambulance my vitals were normal except elevated heart rate and O2 and  was admitted at 2:40 in the morning. I received a chest x ray and  my heart rate was better.  The dizziness was under control by then. I was discharged at 4:50 in the morning.

                                                Johnson and johnson covid-19 vaccine eau  March 20th - allergic reaction to covid vaccine Johnson &amp; Johnson. Allergic reaction started approximately 2 minutes after receiving shot. It started with itching and redness on my arms and upper chest. After approximately 10 minutes, I knew something was wrong and I signaled an attendant. They immediately brought me over to the EMTs on site, where they looks me over and started drawing up IV Benadryl. In the time it took for them to draw up IV Benadryl and insert the IV, the hives on my chest started to turn into burning and ice sensations intermittently. As soon as they administered the IV Benadryl, the itching redness and hives on my arms went away within a couple minutes, and I was left with only redness on my upper chest. They felt comfortable with me getting a ride to the ER from my dad and not getting emergency transport. At the ER, they gave me pepcid and prednisone. About an hour and a half later, I started developing chest tightness and hives and redness on the side of my face. They decided to administer more Benadryl and start epinephrine. I was discharged a couple hours later.  March 22nd - I went back to the hospital, with complaints of severe stomach pain. The stomach pain lasted approximately 24 hours.  March 20th to march 26th - I experienced extreme fatigue. I was exhausted to the point where on Wednesday I took a ten minute shower and by the end of it I had to lay down again because I was shaking from exhaustion.  Symptoms improved slightly until April 5th where it started taking a turn for the worse.  April 5th - I started noticing black spots in my vision that wouldn&#39;t go away. They didn&#39;t move and they stayed in one spot for hours until I fell asleep and then they&#39;d be gone the next morning. They usually started around 8:00 or 9:00 at night. Sometimes a couple hours earlier. They came every day until Friday April 9th when they did not come.   April 5th to present - I also started noticing light-headedness, motion sickness when I stood still or sat in a chair, nausea, neck pain, and periods of muscle weakness in the neck. These symptoms have not stopped.  Friday April 9th around 6:45 p.m. I started having a bad migraine, I noticed in the bathroom at work my eyes were dilating over and over and over again rapidly. The pain was very high. I ended up leaving work early and going to the emergency room. While at the emergency room they treated my migraine with a cocktail of Benadryl, toradol, and compazine. It reduced the pain at the time, however it did not take away the migraine.  Friday April 9th to present - My migraine has continued from April 9th and is still happening. I have been having severe light sensitivity, sound sensitivity, and trouble reading. The rapid dilation of my eyes stopped April 10th, however my eyes stayed dilated until April 12th.  In addition to all of my other symptoms, there are others that I am not as positive are relevant. I have asthma and it has been worse over the past couple of weeks, it it is not usually worse this time of year. I&#39;ve been also been having quite a bit more light bruising than normal over the past two weeks and over the past one and a half weeks I have noticed red spots all over my skin. I was not sure if these red spots were normal or not because I do have them on occasion however these are darker than normal.

                                                Around 9pm was very tired with small headache. Went to bed at 10pm and laid there for an hour and a half with my head pounding and burning. I?ve never been able to feel a fever on myself?it was so high. I also had major chills the whole time. I?d get up and hydrate and took 2 Advil around 12:30pm as no sign of sleep was coming. I put ice packs on my hot head for an hour with no relief. Meanwhile my heart rate was steadily above 100 for the whole night until about 4am when my fever went down and I was able to sleep till 7am. I thought I was going to die it was so hot and painful and pounding. In the morning the fever is gone and I am extremely tired. Currently not recommending people get the vaccine.

                                                Headache started around 7 pm and progressively got worse. Took two Aleve which didn?t help in mitigating pain.  Chills around the same time, eventually developing a fever around 10. Used ice packs to try and help bring the fever down. Woke up in the middle of the night sweating through my shirt. Dizziness upon standing, leg pain and chest pain.

                                                Patient briefly slumped over and appeared to pass out shortly after receiving the vaccine.  This only lasted about 30 sec to a minute before she became responsive again.  Patient reported that this has happened multiple times before when she has received vaccines and was anxious (crying) prior to receiving the vaccine.  An initial blood pressure reading was 100/64 at 12:50.   She was then able to sit up in the chair and began feeling a little better, asking for water.  A second reading five minutes later was 94/54.  The patient then chose to drink some water and eat some candy she had brought and this seemed to make her feel better.  Lightheadness/weakness was the only symptom she complained of.  By 1:03, 15 minutes after the vaccine, she reported &#34;feeing much better.&#34;  I continued to observe her, seated, for 15 more minutes and a final blood pressure reading at that time was 115/74.  Patient reported feeling normal again and went home.

At 8:00 chills started, along with a feeling of all my muscles contracting , lost the ability for fine motor control and  fell asleep at 9.pm. Woke up at 12:45am covered in sweat feeling as if I was burning with a splitting heavy headache, had fever, don?t know temperature new house so no thermometer but it sucked. dunked head in sink. Legs could barely support me so I couldn?t go down the stairs for pain medication, went back to bed. Got cold washcloth at 1:00am pain felt pretty unbearable, couldn?t make it downstairs or move at this point so I spent night in and out of sleep unable to move. Muscles still feel like rocks and my head feels like it?s stuffed with a mixture of Vaseline and nitroglycerin, every time I move it feels like my brains smashing into my skull with little explosions. Recent development within the last 5-6 hours maybe?(3:00-4:00pm) centralized over my breast bone feels incredibly painful, hurts to breath and feels like something heavy is pressing it through my chest into my spine. Not sure what to do or if this is normal but it hurts really really bad. Accurate hours because I was lucidly texting my friends to make sure I wouldn?t pass out, so I have nearly exact hours when each symptom appeared till I could no longer use my fingers.

Stayed seated until it mostly passed, then went outside for fresh air and to cool down. Put a cold rag on forehead/back of neck for half hour following symptoms. Drank water at soon as possible. For the next 36 hours after receiving the vaccine: sensitive skin, muscle weakness, tiredness, headache, body aches (including the sight of injection), chills, hot flashes. Took Advil every few hours to reduce pain, kept lights off, laid in bed to rest.

                                                I had the typical soreness about 12 hours after the injection. No worries there. The next morning, on the 10th, around 11:40 AM, I started feeling extremely dizzy. The room started spinning. I was standing at the time, and I kept standing, but other than that, I had no control. My hearing starting going fuzzy, starting with ringing in my ears until it sounded like I was underwater. My vision started blurring, as well, eventually going completely black. For a solid 5-10 seconds, I could neither hear clearly nor see at all. I was conscious, because I could think relatively clearly, and I could feel my eyes blinking and could wiggle my fingers, but that was it. Once the episode passed, I immediately sat down. About a minute later, I started having excruciating abdominal pain. The pain was wracking my whole body, causing me to go pale (as I later saw once I could hobble to the bathroom) and making me sweat. After about twenty minutes, the whole thing passed and I was left with minor dizziness and slight nausea. Now, three days later, I still have some of the dizziness, but none of the blindness, deafness, or pain has returned. All other side effects, such as soreness, have completely left.

She became very weak.  She had a horrible and very scary reaction to the vaccine. She was in the hall face down when we found her and we could not get her to wake up.  When she did come to, we could not calm her. Patient normally lives by herself and luckily was with us when this happened.  We can&#39;t imagine what would have happened if she was alone.

No cough, no SOB, c/o chest pain on inspiration intermittently, more a sharp pain near the center just above the breastbone, not a squeezing or a pressure substernal  Took some APAP and took alleve 20 min ago  I adv that the body aches, N, HA all may be consistent with ADR to the vaccine and generally should be limited to a few days, ok to take OTC pain relievers but not in excess to bottle recommendations. Keep hydrated. Consider a hot pack. Watch the chest pain if this persists or worsens,  consider HCF evaluation, though given the body pain throughout and location of the pain may be muscular.

                                                Upon receiving the vaccine, I immediately fainted (vasovagal syncope). I was unconscious for ~15-20 seconds. My apartment-mate who came with me for the shot laid me down on the floor until I could sit up again without feeling dizzy (~15 min). I also had pretty serious bruising at the injection site for ~9 days following the injection and my arm was swollen and painful (although this is a pretty normal side-effect).

                                                For thirty-six hours after the vaccine. I had body aches and chills and my eye sockets were sore and it hurt to look up. Ten days after the vaccine I was in the shower and a large blood clot came out of my nose. It was a large clot about the size of a quarter and there was no other blood with it. The clot came out of my left nostril but it was not like a nose bleed. I went to the Urgent Care but they did not do tests.

I fell back to sleep an hour later after covering myself with another blanket and throwing up. My Apple Watch shows at 4 AM my heart rate rose to 127 BPM when I was asleep. It is now 6 PM and I am feeling body aches, headache, stuffy nose, still a bit nauseous-- almost like cold symptoms.

                                                The night of my vaccine date (6 hours after) I was fatigued and started a fever with chills and acheyness which kept me in bed all night. I got up to shower and get some food as I was going upstairs I grew very faint,  my vision grew black and my hearing faded. I was able to make it to my bed then ask for some help. After taking Tylenol, my fever began to be very hot instead of chills. I was able to fall asleep until I woke back up to chills again and taking more medicine.  The next morning, I was still dizzy when I walked around but the fever was gone. I was still very fatigued which made me unable to go to class or work. Day 3 I was back to my normal self.

                                                Originally, I started with random muscle aches in my left shoulder then it went down my back (a few hours after receiving vaccine). Then slightly fogginess and at night the muscle pain became worse making it difficult to sleep and started getting cold flashes. Once asleep around 12:30 I started getting muscle aches that felt like they were burning and in random spots on body along with a headache and would get random cold and heat flashes. Kept yelling out in pain all night and increased tremors in hands. Boyfriend noticed I had a fever as well and gave me ibuprofen around 3am since pain was unbearable and was difficult to sleep. Almost took me to the hospital due to the intense pain.. In morning slightly better but still frontal lobe pain and aches throughout body with raised heart rate. Cannot do much or else aches get worse including headache.

We applied cold clothes to the neck and head and patient felt like she was going to vomit so we also gave her a bag just in case she got sick. She started looking very pale so we layed patient on floor. She started to panic that she wasn&#39;t going to go to work and eyes were rolling in the back of head. Called 911 for patient and I stayed with patient, I took her blood pressure which was normal. Patient became fully alert again and stated she was feeling a little better. The ems checked her blood pressure and blood sugar and released the patient.

However at 3 am I got up to use the restroom. I was sitting on the toilet and then next thing I remember I was on the floor with my face down. I passed out, and I am unsure how long I was out for, before I realized what happened. I have never passed out before, and do not have a history of doing so, so it is unclear why I passed out randomly.

                                                My daughter got the shot at 1 pm on the 8th of April, 2021. (My daughter &amp; I both got the shot at the same shot at the same time). By 11:00 pm my daughter started complaining with feeling dizzy. She kept saying she felt like she was going to throw up, meaning she was nauseated. She was complaining with her bones hurting. We both got these symptoms at the same time. We both stayed in and out of the shower letting the shower water just run on us. I had to give her ibuprofen because she complained of a mild headache &amp; the pain all over her body. She couldn?t sleep at all. She cried. It had her scared. I fully believe she?s having an allergic reaction to the Janssen shot. I have fully read the Janssen ?fact sheet?. My daughter was having hot flashes &amp; cold sweats. She has ongoing symptoms &amp; it?s been 2 days since receiving shot including fever. She was having what I thought heart palpitations. We both swelled up causing our bodies to feel tight. We both were healthy before receiving the shot. We?ve never had covid nor tested positive. We are currently going to receive a check up by a doctor. The side effects of this medication is dangerous &amp; doesn?t compare to flu like symptoms.

                                                History of Present Illness     This is a 22-year-old female who was previously healthy with no significant past medical history presenting to the emergency department after a syncopal event.  She was getting her COVID-19 shot today (Johnson Johnson).  After her shot she was texting on the phone with her mom, felt slightly dizzy and the next thing she remembers was lying on the ground.  Witnesses reported that she syncopized and had some convulsive like behavior afterwards.  She was not postictal or incontinent however.  She reportedly hit the front of her forehead on the left side.  She denies any chest pain, abdominal pain, hemoptysis, recent surgeries, immobilization or recent travel.  She reports that when she woke up her hands felt a little bit tingly.  When the fire department arrived they found her to be bradycardic however by the time the medics arrived her heart rate had resolved.  Her blood sugar was 110 on the scene.  Medics noted that she was orthostatic on the scene as well.   She currently is feeling well, has no complaints.  States that she has gotten dizzy before in the past with COVID vaccines.

Mother reports that she had the vaccine, had no symptoms, and then started with a fever that evening of 103.  She was having cold extremities, numbness, tingling of the arms, face, legs.  The fever dropped and went away and was having fatigue and getting winded doing regular activities.  By Monday she continued with the shortness of breath and go increasingly worse as the days went on and also the.  By Wednesday she was having chest pain, numbness and tingling of her extremities and shortness of breath.  She went to the hospital, gave her IVs, says her BP was elevated and sent her home.

She was then taken back to the hospital and said that she her BP was high and said that she had the Janssen vaccine, and said that she was hyperventilation due to anxiety.  Once they got her stable and released her again.  Mother asked the doctor if he felt that this was normal, and could see her throat contracting and that she was stable and to go home, and he said yes and that it was anxiety and that sometimes we get ourselves worked up about things and that was causing it.    The daughter has no history of anxiety, no breathing issues.   They did labs and everything was okay, her counts were somewhat off but nothing felt to be abnormal.      She then went to another Hospital as she was still not feeling well, and checked the other reports from the other hospital and they conferred with that information, gave her Valium and sent her home.    As the evening progressed on Friday 4/16/21 she started having chest pains and her girlfriends mother is a nurse and came and saw her and called the mother and told her that she did not like how she was looking, and that her SOB and weakness in her extremities and the tightness in her chest was not right and that she felt that she had a PE.    They took her to another location, she had extremely high calcium levels, and high blood pressure and her heart rate was high and she was admitted.  She has been on flushes to reduce calcium, and her blood levels are improving.  She is on Warfarin to prevent clotting.  She has had a CAT scan and other studies and all were negative.  She felt better yesterday, but she states today that she is not feeling as well, she is nauseous and gave her Zofran,  has a headache, and they gave her something a little stronger than Tylenol.  She is extremely fatigued and weak.    Mother said that she saw her on Sunday 4/18/21 and that she was not able to walk, they had to put her in a wheelchair, and her grandfather walks faster than she can.    They are presently getting her up to get her to walk and see how her strength is, 4/20/21.  They are now waiting to get her levels under control and to see if she is strong enough to go home.  Neurology released her from their standpoint as they did not see anything, but she is to FU with them afterwards and want to do EMG&#39;s as an out patient.

                                                Around 10pm on 3/26, I got a slight headache, but I am not sure if it was due to screen time or a vaccine side effect. Per the clinician that administered the shot, I took 2 tabs of Tylenol (one normal adult dose) with water and went to bed. At 1 am on 3/27, I woke up incredibly sore all over but especially in my joints. I was shivering badly and woke up in a tightly curled fetal position. I was unable to lie still or warm up. I eventually went back to sleep and woke up at 5 am, this time with extreme nausea and threw up everything I had eaten the day before. This went on for a couple of minutes. I was still shivering constantly and sore and achy everywhere. Especially in my knees, shoulders, and lower back. At 6 am, I was still awake and while I still had chills, my face felt hot and I took my temperature twice. First getting 100.74 then 100.86. Slept deeply for the rest of the night. At noon on 3/27 I woke up with no nausea,  body aches but only in my joints but with general soreness everywhere (like after a good workout) and a temp still in the 100.7 degree range. I took 2 Tylenol tabs at 2pm. At 4pm, I only had slight body aches, a headache, and a slight brain fog left and my temp was at 98.7, so no more fever. No further problems showed  up and when I woke up at 9 am on 3/28, I felt absolutely fine other than soreness at the injection site and a little chest tightness which last for about 2 days, through 3/30.

When she lost consciousness, I supported her weight and she remained in the chair for approx 15 seconds until she regained consciousness. I  had two technicians to assist in calling a code white and documenting the event. At 10:43 am, patient lost consciousness and regained 15 seconds later. Once I knew the patient was stable enough to support her own weight, i held her hands to make sure she was not going to lose consciuosness again. I administered an ice pack and a cool towel at 10:45 am. Code white was responded to by associates from AP and manager. I observed the patient for 15 minutes, and AP associate observed for another 15 minutes for a total of 30 minutes. The patient recovered fully and had a friend drive her home.

She said  she was about to pass out. She was sitting on chair with head leaning back, and resting on the wall. I raised her legs, resting on another chair. About 2 min later, she vomited. About 1 min later, she started to feel better. She asked for water, and we gave her some lukewarm water. Her face started to come back to normal, and she started to feel better and better. She sat for another 20 - 30 min, she felt better and left the pharmacy.

We gave her an ice pack and water after she came back and had her lay down for 10 more minutes.  I checked with her a few days later she said she had fever and chills 8 hours after the vaccine but felt better.

                                                At about 5 hours after receiving the vaccine at around 5 p.m., I developed a pounding headache. As the night continued, if I moved my head at all it would cause severe pain and a pounding headache. Additionally, I experienced shooting pains through my neck and back, I became extremely hot to the touch, yet I felt freezing cold and could not stop shivering. Then I developed severe aching and tingling from the top of my head to the tips of my toes, with excruciating lower back pain and I could feel my heart beating very fast. My entire body was tense and sore. These symptoms did not alleviate for 12 hours and I could not fall asleep due to the discomfort I was in. I finally was able to fall asleep at 6 a.m. after the aching/tingling/pain/hotness subsided (about 12 hours after side effects started).

                                                Approximately 4 hours after receiving the injection, I started developing a fever, within an hour it had reached 103.3 F. At this point I took 400 mg of over the counter ibuprofen which helped drop my temperature slightly to approximately 102.2 F.  This fever continued into the night. I took another dose of ibuprofen before sleeping, about 6 hours after the first dose. Along with fever I experienced strong shaking/chills, muscle and joint soreness, headache, dizziness, confusion, and chest pain/feeling of pressure on the chest. The day after vaccination I continued to have a low-grade fever of approximately 100 F which subsided by evening. All other symptoms subsided as well except for the chest pain. On the second day post-vaccination my only remaining symptom is the chest pain.

                                                I received the shot at 14:30, in which medical staff in the jail&#39;s medical center watched me for 20 minutes to ensure there were no immediate reactions. I went about my day afterward with no symptoms. At 21:30 when I went to sleep, I got some aches in my joints and took 1 dose of liquid capsule NyQuil to help with the pain and went to sleep. At 00:30, the 7th, I woke up groaning in my sleep to the extreme pain in my joints and feeling hot internally. I decided to get up and take a warm bath to ease the aches. I went and ran the bath and all of a sudden while it was running, I had a severe need to throw up, but could not naturally. Since this was concerning, I got up and walked out of the bathroom and all of a sudden in the hall I got a feeling of impending doom and that something was not right and I fainted. I laid on the floor for what I would approximate to be 5 minutes going in and out of consciousness waiting for the blood to fully return to the brain. After this, I instantly felt like I needed to survive and that I felt like I could be dying so I slowly crawled down the stairs to get to my military ID so I could call the military&#39;s nurse advice line. I had to take a break and lay on the concrete in my garage because I felt so dizzy and so hot and began to feel my vision disappear like I was going to faint again. I waited a few minutes before getting back up the stairs crawling to my phone to call. When I called them 00:58, they told me to call 911 because they believed I would be having a severe reaction, though I noted to them I did not have a rash or hives. I then called 911 at 01:08. They sent EMT&#39;s to my home which took my vitals. I had normal blood pressure, SPo2, and temp, but an elevated heart rate of just under 100 and a high respiration rate. EMT&#39;s made the decision for me to stay home since the hospital did not seem immediate in their opinion. After this I stayed on the couch for a few minutes and then felt very tired so I walked slowly to my room and fell asleep. I woke up at 06:00 for work, and arrived at 07:00. In the hour after waking up I was achy, sweating, and felt light headed. I got to work and my Sergeant told me to go home and sleep. I slept another 5 hours at 08:00 and when I woke up most of my symptoms went away other than aches and getting flush very easily for 5 days.  At this current time all I notice is some random light headedness that quickly resolves and comes a few times a day at random and without cause.

I had a fever for the entire day and was feeling dizzy and nauseous for most of that day. I haven&#39;t fainted since then but still feel a little bit dizzy every once in a while.

                                                I received my vaccine April 11th at 3 p.m and began to have a fever around 9 p.m.  My fever did not go away until the next evening. On April 12th I had a fever and woke up with red little dots around my eyes.  At night the fever went away. The following day April 13th I felt my chest tight and had shortness of breath throughout the day. I also had stomach pains at times.  April 14th and 15th (today) my chest still feels tight and I get tired very easily.  My arm is also still very sore and sensitive, I have a little bump where the vaccine was put in.

Felt like she has a fever, but none registered on the thermometer. Body aches, malaise present. No chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, or vertigo. She does have diarrhea x1 today. I am calling her often, to find out any other sx. I will take her for a covid test when I get off of work, if she still feels poorly.

                                                Immediately after receiving the shot I began to have fairly intense pain at injection site. It continued in waves. I began to walk around the store for the allotted 15 minutes. I began to feel very dizzy and faint. My ears began ringing and I didn?t feel well. I stumbled back to the pharmacy to ask for help. At this point I was also feeling like it was very hard to breathe. I explained all these symptoms to the pharmacists on duty and they told me to just sit down. After sitting down I still felt faint but suddenly felt the need to vomit. I stumbled to the bathroom where I collapsed in front of the toilet and passed out twice, striking my head and throat on the bowl. After awaking I was very disoriented and felt very hot and clammy. The pharmacist then came and found me and told me to once again sit down and continue waiting. After sitting down for about 5 more minutes I began to feel less dizzy and was having an easier time breathing. I left the store as the pharmacist was ignoring me and didn?t seem concerned about my symptoms. After arriving home I was tired and week and very very cold. I noted my body temp was lower than usual. I took a nap and then these symptoms continued for about 24 hours. I am now feeling much better.

                                                Patient came in for Janssen COVID vaccine that was scheduled electronically online.  All appropriate prescreening was done and patient had no previous allergies or issues.  Patient was instructed to sit in one of the chairs designated for post vaccine observation for 15 minutes after her vaccine.  Within a minute or so  patient felt light headed and like she might pass out. She notified the technician who was right there and he notified me.  I assisted her to a sitting position on the floor from her chair and I was able to ease her back to a lying down position from there with her head on the floor and feet elevated above heart on a chair.  Patient was able to talk the whole time.  She told us at that point when she was younger she was scared of shots and had fainted when having them, but thought she was past that and did not mention it during screening. She said she was surprised to feel this way because she was so excited about getting her COVID vaccine.  She had not eaten much today (a small snack) and had rushed here for her appointment without getting food. I checked her blood pressure while she was lying down and it was 94/63 and pulse of 75.  She said she normally had lower end of normal blood pressure.   She was pale when I started checking her, but her color began to return to normal within minutes. After 5 minutes she felt well enough to sit up and we got her a granola bar and water.  She remained this way for 5 minutes and felt good, so we moved her to sitting in a chair and got her a pepperoni and cheese snack tray from the cafe.  She ate this and waited for 10minutes and felt good. We walked her to her car and she felt fine.  I called to verify she got home fine and she did.

                                                Sunday night, my heart started pounding really hard. I went to ER - Medical Center. They did an EKG and took my vitals. I had a fever (slight) and chills and was nauseous. Put  ONDANSETRON -4 mg. The nausea didn&#39;t go away and I couldn&#39;t eat or drink without vomiting until today. I couldn&#39;t eat or drink or was very tired and groggy and miserable. Today I  had another trip to the ER Medical, I got on an antibiotic and anti-nausea medication (GETHALEXIN - 500 mg for the GI) (METOCLOPRAMIGE HCL - 5 mg-  for nausea) from the hospital and I had a shot that went into my immune system. They also found a UTI today.

                                                About 5 hours after my vaccine I had already been asleep for around 30 minutes when I was startled awake by my own rapid heartbeat, it was beating so fast and hard that I could hear it and it woke me up. I reviewed my literature about the vaccine I received at the pharmacy and saw this reaction could be due to an allergic reaction but as an uninsured person I had to just wait it out to see if it would go away. I drank a lot of water and started developing a headache but my heart rate finally slowed down enough that I was no longer alarmed, but it was still faster than usual. I went back to sleep around 2am only to awake once again around 5am because I had begun to experience the worst body aches I?ve ever felt as well as nausea and a pounding headache. I live on a semi truck with no bathroom so my fiancé had to take me to my parents house so I would have access to a bathroom. I took ibuprofen and Tylenol for my pain and took 6 showers in 24 hours just to soothe my body aches. It felt worse than any flu I?ve ever had (I received the flu vaccine back in January if that matters). I was extremely ill and had no appetite and pretty much just slept and cried for about 36 hours total, but yesterday afternoon I finally felt a little better although still experiencing a terrible headache. Today I woke up feeling completely fine. I just wanted to report my side effects.

                                                I passed out in my bathroom the morning after the vaccine shot around 5:30am. I called the doctors and they said that was unrelated to the vaccine, but I had intense dizziness and tinnitis before I passed out. I was incredibly fatigued all day long for the rest of the day and had a migraine - both to be expected. However, I am 3 weeks post-vaccine (April 3) and have been having intense muscle cramping and fatigue in my legs during exercise. I wake up with muscle soreness that goes away throughout the day and then comes back during exercise.

                                                At around 9:15 PM I started to feel nauseous and got out of bed to go to the bathroom. While using the bathroom I felt a very strong chill come over my whole body and started shivering and got directly back into bed and wrapped myself up in a thick blanket. For 45 minutes I laid wrapped up and was shivering constantly. At 10 pm I was brought extra blankets and a heating pad but moving to get situated caused dizziness. It was about 10:30 when the shivering stopped. I was able to sleep but got up to go got the bathroom around midnight and my entire body was drained of energy and I felt that I could barely stand and walk on my own. I was dizzy and my head hurt as well. I could barely hold my arms up to look at my phone briefly. Between 11 PM and 2 AM I had 5 or 6 high heart rate alerts (over 120) according to my Apple Watch but I did not wake up to them. In the morning (Sunday 4/4/21) around 9-10 am my head still hurt and my body was very achy and I felt very hungover. All day I continued to feel achy almost with a bad cold or a minor flu. Today has been better but I have still felt pretty drained. I?ve had continuous arm soreness in the arm I got the injection - but nothing too severe.   15 minutes after my vaccine on Saturday 4/3/21 I took 600 mg of ibuprofen and around midnight of that night I took 2 of pain relief PM acetaminophen (1000 mg of acetaminophen total snd 50 mg of diphenhydramine HCI total)

                                                Initial injection was recieved with arm extended out and raised in car window. Really painful injection. Several seconds after vaccine injected I felt a wave of chills on my body and immediately started profusely sweating. Seconds after that i then began to get extremely dizzy, blacking out, trying to stay conscious for a personnel to walk by and after a few moments the feeling slowly lightened up minus the excessive sweating and chills. Personnel then told me it was just anxiety and brushed it off. I have never had a reaction like this from a vaccine before so this experience was unsettling.

Was gone around 3/4pm) - headache (probably from dehydration, I was warm, but not completely a fever. Attempted to drink a lot of water, but too much made me nauseous)  - chills (sporadic, barely noticeable except it agitated the headache) - nausea (I barely ate more than a granola bar and attempted to drink water and tea, but too much made me sick, especially if it had sugar - mainly drank water. Had some soup later in the day (6pm) and most of the nausea went away)

                                                Prior to administration of Janssen Covid-19 vaccine the patient was anxious but was completely fine once the procedure commenced and concluded. After finishing explaining the possible side effects of the vaccine and handing the patient the V-Safe handout, she got up slowly and proceeded to our designated post vaccination monitoring seating arrangement. Upon concluding the vaccination process with the patient?s partner, she alerted the pharmacist that she does not feel well. To which he asked her to further elaborate on what she is experiencing. She began to say she thinks she?s going to faint as she is attempting to drink water. As she was having a drink of water she fainted. To which he responded by running over and catching her before she hit the ground, cradling her upper torso, specifically the head and laid her down on the floor with the assistance of pharmacist and her partner. In the midst of everything he instructed another pharmacy technician to call 911 for the paramedics. As she was in the process of drinking water I saw her other hand go to the region of the neck, thinking it was also an allergic reaction and administered a dose of Epi-Pen. He administered the Epi-Pen on the upper side of her thigh, directly to the skin not through clothing. There was a very brief moment where the patient began to convulse but gradually regain consciousness. The patient became lucid and was conversing with him, apologizing for the incident. He assured her there was nothing to apologize for and to which she told me she had similar incidents from vaccinations as a child. She did not mention this prior to administration of the vaccine and through conversation we believe the incident may be caused from high anxiety of needles / vaccinations. When the paramedics arrived, they assisted the patient from the floor and gave a warning that she believed she was going to faint again, and fainted in the arms of the paramedics.

                                                Trouble breathing as the shot was administered. Vision began to black out after 3 minutes. Urge to vomit, extreme nausea. Passed out, unconscious within 5 minutes of receiving the shot. Could not sit up/dizzy for 30 minutes. Nausea, weakness, dizzy, poor mental acuity/memory. Later that night, and through the night for 10 hours, severe back pain. Nausea, severe weakness, dizzy, poor mental acuity and memory, sweats and chills.  The next day (day immediately after receiving vaccine) symptoms continued but lessened by 5 pm. Each day since then, the symptoms have ALL remained in a more mild form. Today is day 6 and I still have moderate back pain and occasional sweats, weakness and fatigue.

                                                Patient was a walk-in COVID-19 applicant. She filled out her form and told me she&#39;s very scared of needles and has fainted in the past from getting a vaccine. I asked whether she was comfortable receive vaccine at pharmacy setting and she said she really wanted the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine to avoid getting two shots. She appeared calm and the administration of the vaccine went smoothly without any issues. During the 15 minute observation period, patient&#39;s mother and technicians alerted me she has fallen over. I quickly instructed by technician to call 911, while the other paged CODE WHITE and I rushed to the patient. Her father helped me lie her down on their back (supine) and I elevated the patient s feet onto the chair. I took of her mask to listen to make sure she was breathing and she quickly regained consciousness and looked right at me. I had her take some deep breaths for me to make sure airways were clear and helped her sit down in a chair. I asked her to stay an additional 15 minutes to ensureshe is feeling fine. She decline emergency personnel from coming to the store. She was fine and left the store after 15 minutes. I will follow up with her to make sure she&#39;s doing well on 05/10/21.

                                                Within seconds of receiving the vaccine I began to feel slightly dizzy. By the time I walked across the room to the observation table I was feeling lightheaded. They sat me down, gave me water and a cookie, but about 2min after the injection the dizziness was so intense that I began to black out. I was unconscious for about 1-2min, then came to but my vision was still unclear. I was taken via wheelchair to the paramedics on the opposite end of the gymnasium, and at this point I was heavily perspiring and very pale but still coherent. I felt my vision and dizziness significantly improve after being able to lay down. I was transported to the hospital for observation but had much improved by the time I arrived. An EKG, bloodwork, and cardiac tests were recommended to discern possible underlying heart related conditions, but I declined because I already had a PAT for thyroid surgery scheduled the next day that would be running those same tests. This reaction was likely due to not having eaten  for several hours prior to the vaccine. After about an hour I felt well enough to drive myself back home and dealt with mild aches and pains that evening, chills, and a low grade fever all of which resolved themselves by the next morning.

She began to feel faint and an employee of our facility caught her as she experienced a near syncopal episode. She was promptly placed in Trendelenburg position and vitals obtained. BP was 90/58 with mild tachycardia to max of 130-140 bpm. Patient was given supportive treatment and monitored. BP improved to 110/70 after 5 minutes and 120/72 after 15 minutes. Patient continued to feel very dizzy and weak, however, and became tachycardic and diaphoretic each time she attempted to move to a seated position. After 1 hour of monitoring and vitals showing continued tachycardia, decision was made to transport the patient to ER for further testing. Patient expressed agreement and understanding of plan to transport to ER via ambulance.

                                                Patient had vaccine on 3/18/21 at 1600. She presented to the ED on 3/21/21 @ 2202 for chest pain that started at ~1600. She states the chest pain is in the center of her chest, feels like pressure, non-radiating, with occasional shortness of breath. It felt similar to when she had COVID in January. She denies other symptoms including fever, URI symptoms, palpitations, pain with deep inspiration, leg swelling, recent travel, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, feeling like she was going to pass out, rash or other symptoms. It is not exertional and was better with walking. Denies heavy lifting or injury. She was hypertensive in the ED BP 151/99 but all other vitals within normal limits. EKG shows NSR without evidence of arrhythmia or ischemic changes. She did have U waves seen so labs were drawn including CBC, CMP, cardiac enzymes. Chest x-ray showed no acute cardiopulmonary process. She received 30 mg Toradol IV for pain. Labs were all within normal limits except mild hypokalemia. She felt better on reassessment and BP was still elevated but improved 137/90. She was discharged and instructed to take OTC Tylenol as on the bottle as needed for pain and given return precautions and follow up with PCP on return to stateside.

After providing the same immunization to her spouse she lost color in her face, began sweating, and became faint. She did not lose consciousness but was drowsy, diaphoretic, pale and stated she lost hearing for a couple minutes. I kept her awake and asked her questions to assess for alertness. She was aware of date, location, name, year. She was not improving after 5 minutes so paramedics were called to evaluate her. She was cared for by the paramedic team and recovered after 40 minutes. She was diagnosed with vasovagal syncope due to the vaccine. She refused transport to the ER and left of her own accord.

When I attempted to take a shower, I fainted for a few seconds and it was a struggle to move. Only felt comfortable when I was laying down. My muscles all felt painful and sore, had a painful headache, felt very disoriented and woozy. It was a struggle to walk or move, and couldn&#39;t talk loud or for a long time at once. Had to go home from work and spent the rest of the day sleeping. Around 4pm, 24 hours after the injection, my muscles felt less sore and was feeling better. The next morning, I was back to being completely normal.

                                                I walked up the stairs to go to bed at 10:45pm and started feeling very dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseous. At the top of the stairs I passed out and fell backwards. Not sure exactly how long I was out, but no more than a few minutes. When I woke up I was disoriented and nauseous but didn&#39;t have the strength to get up. I rolled into my side and vomited 3 times. My fiance helped me get up slowly. He took my temp but I did NOT have a fever. The nausea, dizziness, and lightheadedness subsided after about 10 minutes, so I decided to NOT seek medical attention. This morning I have a headache and body aches in my lower back and left arm.

When seated in a chair in the waiting area, patient stated she started to feel light headed and sweaty and has fainted before (not from a vaccine), so she sat back in the chair and then awoke on the floor.  She bumped her forehead on the floor and has an egg-sized raised bump on her forehead.  We applied ice instantly and monitored her blood pressure until she felt well enough to sit up.  She did not feel she needed an ambulance and refused going to urgent care. She is feeling fine other than the bump.  A worker took a report and I discussed with her what to watch for to monitor for concussion.  Her roommate is driving her home.  Event will also be reported today.

On Wednesday I went to the Hospital and for chest pain (when I would breathe in), shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, and a fever (on Monday). They rain many tests with chest scans and found all to be clear except I had a ?extremely elevated? white blood cell count. They said they ran blood tests and did not think I had blood clots and they did an MRI and chest x-ray and could not find anything. They sent me home to rest. The rest of the week I had trouble breathing and it slowly started getting better on Friday.

Onsite paramedics stated blood sugar, blood pressure, and pulse were within normal range after sitting on stretcher for 15 minutes. I signed a release refusing transport to hospital as i was feeling better. Throughout the first day I started feeling tired and sore but that was to be expected. Following day 4/11, extremely nauseous, headache, body aches and typical flu like symptoms, low grade fever of 100-101. At roughly 9:45 am and again at 11:25 am started throwing up bile/stomach acid.  Flu like symptoms did not subside until morning of 4/13.

When she  came to the pharmacist gave her some orange juice.  It didn&#39;t help and she  was very nauseous.  When  she got up to leave she was totally incoherent, was unable to walk on her own.  When she got home she was no better so I first called our family doctor which both said take her to the ER.  There they did many tests and they all came back fine so they sent her home.  By that evening she was able to walk on her own and talking right.  She was terribly tired and still today 4/14 she is feeling worse but still not 100%. With the pause today for this vaccine we are very worried about this.

Had J&amp;J vaccine on 4/9.    - Lab repeated and confirmed - D/w MFM and Hematologist.  In an abundance of caution, will get coags, CMP, and P/cr urine ratio to evaluate for HELLP.  Will also get HIT antibodies to evaluate for possibility of Vaccine induced thrombocytopenia(VIT). - Will plan on treating with Dexamethasone 40mg Daily x 4 days to increase platelet count.  D/w hematologist, and he will see the patient and run the test for HIT antibodies (PF-4) and initiate IVIG treatment, which would help treat the low platelets either from exacerbation of ITP or VIT. If these come back positive, will likely transfer patient to HN for admission and delivery to be followed by therapeutic anticoagulation with non-heparin based therapy, consistent with usual therapy for HIT.

                                                About 7 minutes of receiving my J&amp;J vaccine, I started to feel nauseous while sitting down and waiting for my fifteen minutes of monitoring. I experienced pain in my left arm and my heart was beating fast. My vision was in and out, started seeing black and white spots. I then got up from my chair and I went to the counter and as I was talking to the clerk telling her I did not feel good, I just went down and fainted. I had fainted and when I came back, woke up a nurse was trying t put an epi-pen on me but I told her I did not need it. They called the ambulance and they monitored me there. The EMT said to me that my blood pressure had dropped and I had had a &#34;vasovagal syncope&#34; and that my body probably went into shock. I did not go to the hospital and went home. For the rest of the day I felt ill, and out of it. I also felt pain, an aching pain to the right buttocks region. The next day I still felt not good. Also I have noticed since the J&amp;J vaccine, I had my menstrual cycle but normally my menstrual cycle lasts 5 days now this month it only lasted about 4 hours and I this concerns me.  Before this vaccine, I did not have experience these symptoms.

                                                Night of vaccine had severe body aches, back pain, leg pain severe until legs went numb, then arm pain severe until also numb, chest pains/ trouble breathing.  Following days had pains in arms and legs as if a tourniquet was left on and I cycled through severe pain and being numb. 5 days in I lost my vision (super blurry and seeing double) and lost complete control of arms and legs on top of headache and chest pains. Vision came back a couple hours later but the leg pains/ numbness continued even now. It feels as if my circulation has been cut off.

                                                I was ok after receiving the vaccine. Just a bit nausea and then everything was ok. I received the vaccine on 5th of may and i had a severe headache and fatigue on 11th may (evening) i couldnt figure out the reason. I had a Tylenol and rested for sometime. At night the headache started again severely on the right side of my head and right leg also had muscle aches and i had zero energy. On the 12th it was the sane and blood pressure was on a lower side. On the 13th it was ok in the morning but after noon i had no energy and pain in both legs. I had a blood pressure of 90/48 which was quite low, i never had such an episode of low or a high blood pressure. I had a few boiled eggs with salt and 4-6 dates and i was able to get rid of aches in my body but not fully. At night of 13th may i was able to maintain a blood pressure of 104/55.
