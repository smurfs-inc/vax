                                                patient received Janssen Covid 19 vaccine at our clinic inside store. pt was waiting in waiting area for 15 minutes and she informed us she was not feeling well and felt like passing out. She had been waiting less than 10 minutes.  I went to her and she said she was feeling very strange and was nauseous. I tried to get her up but she couldn&#39;t walk so I let her sit back down. She was not able to communicate with me but was conscious. She said her vision was distorted. her lips started to turn blue and I continued to monitor her. I called 911 and she said she was having difficulty catching her breath so I went for the epipen and gave her 0.3 mg in the outer thigh of her right leg. her color started to improve and she was able to comunicate better. I followed EMS instructions and continued to monitor her until they arrived.

                                                A few seconds after vaccine was given I had a sensation go up my left jawline that felt similar to a nerve pain.  I didn&#39;t think much of it and waited the 10 minutes after my vaccine and had no other symptoms.  I left the pharmacy and started driving home and had a sudden sensation of a heaviness in my chest and trouble taking a deep breath.  I also felt like my tongue and throat were swelling slightly.  I had a warm sensation throughout the middle of my back that felt like a heating pad was on it.  I felt light-headed and called my husband.  As I continued to drive my symptoms worsened and I called 911.  I made it home in my car and the ambulance met me there.  My husband called the pharmacy to ask them what we should do and they said that it would be ok for him to give me Benadryl.  I took 15mL of liquid Benadryl shortly before the ambulance arrived.   Within 15-20 minutes, I felt like I was able to swallow better.  In the ER, I received IV Benadryl and Famotidine.  I was also given 800mg of Ibuprofen for a bad headache I developed.  My oxygen level remained in the high 90&#39;s and my symptoms were much improved after the IV medication.  I was instructed to continue taking Benadryl capsules for the next few days along with Pepcid to keep my symptoms from flaring back up.  I noticed this morning when waking up that the left side of my face as well as my throat felt odd so I took the Pepcid and Benadryl and symptoms were relieved in 30 mins or so.

The chills subsided after about 2 hours, but then my resting heart rate went up to 110-120 bpm rather than the normal 75-85 for me. It felt like my heart was beating out of my chest even though I was laying down in bed. That lasted through the night and I felt back to normal around mid-morning.

After no side effects, I drove away.  Only to have a sudden reaction as I was driving.  I&#39;ve felt dizzy with flu vaccines before and have felt the same symptoms as with the covid vaccine when IV dye was injected for a CT scan 5 months ago.  Felt faint/ dizzy, Got severe tachycardia, thought my heart was gonna explode.  I drove back in a hurry, scared and confused. I was waiting to be seen, and no one ever came out.  Symptoms subsided on their own after 15 min, therefore I just left without notifying anyone.  2 hours after vaccine, my arm looked moderately red and swollen, with minimal pain.  7 hours after getting the vaccine I started with chills and body aches.  8 hours after getting the vaccine I felt feverish and malaise.  After taking Tylenol with feverish symptoms (didn&#39;t check temp) slept for 2 hours and felt a little better.

Administered Toradol and IV fluids, discharged me with good vitals, but still tachycardia, headache, and vomiting. The next day (3/20), I still had a bad headache and could  not keep liquids down. I vomited perhaps 12 times, then called the doctor. She sent me to Urgent Care to receive injections of Toradol and Phenergan. Within the hour, I  could drink. Then shortly after, I  could eat. I  felt better for one day. The next day (3/22), my heart started pounding, and I was unable to sleep horizontally. I  needed to sleep on 3 pillows due to chest discomfort. My chest still feels very uncomfortable. Abdominal breathing is helping to an extent. I have had to stay in bed and greatly reduce my activities since receiving the vaccine.  Today is one week, and I am still in bed.

I tried taking a warm bath, but it felt cold. Once I bundled up and got into bed, the chills wore off and transitioned almost immediately to a fever spike, which reached 103.8 at its peak at around 9-9:30p. The fever stayed at that level for about 4-5 hrs, before it started to subside, at around 3a. By 10a on April 4, my fever was down to 99.5 or so, with a headache. Today, April 2, I have no fever and only a mild headache.

                                                Around 6 hours after vaccine, I had uncontrollable chills. This led to a low grade fever. I tried to sleep it off, but woke up with my heart racing- My resting BPM was around 120. My skin was super sensitive. I started taking 2 extra strength Tylenol every 6 hours around 5pm, and that helped a little. I couldn&#39;t focus on anything- I could basically stare at the wall while my heart was hammering. I finally slept, and woke up soaked in sweat with my fever broken (my fever never got above 99) around 2am, and improved steadily after that.

Woke up a few hours later with heart palpitations with 128 bmp that kept climbing, dizziness and shortness of breath.  Went to ER and was monitored for several hours. Had an EKG, temperature check and was given Tylenol.  Headache pain increased but heart rate started to come down enough to be discharged, heart rate was down to around 80 bmp.

                                                My vaccine was administered at 12:30pm. I waited until 12:55 at CVS after the vaccine to make sure there were no reactions. I also move my arm around a lot after the injection to keep it from hurting. I drove home, at lunch and about 2:45 was hit with a very noticeable headache. I never get headaches and eat healthy and consume about a gallon of water a day. I knew it wasn&#39;t from dehydration or being hungry.  Headache was in the temple area and made my eyes hurt in the same way they would if you had cried for an extended period of time or were overtired. At 3pm a wave of exhaustion hit me. I was sitting working trying to combat the headache and felt almost wiped out. I got through the rest of my work day (4:30) and went to lay down immediately. I passed out almost instantly until 7 pm. I work up and showered, ate dinner and started to feel a little warm. It should be noted it was an unseasonably warm day and got up to 77, so it was a tiny bit warm in my home. I put on loose fitting clothes and slayed on the couch still with the bad headache and the injection site started to throb so I placed and ice pack on for 20 minutes. I could only stay awake until 8:45 and got in bed. I could not get comfortable for several hours feeling very warm. I tried a fan on high and drinking more water but i felt very warm like how you feel with the flu. I took my temp at 1130pm it was normal. I continued to toss and turn and feel very warm and slightly dizzy, in the sense that I hadn&#39;t been able to sleep and with the headache my body was just exhausted. Around 2 am i woke up for more water and got in the shower because I had sweated so much my sheets were wet and my clothes. I got out of the shower around 10 minutes later, changed and got new sheets and got back in bad. Around 330 I felt very hot again and opened the windows and got another ice pack for my arm which was throbbing again. I finally fell asleep after 3:45am. I got up for work at 6am. I felt slightly foggy, and very hot. But no fever. My temp is normally around 97.4-97.9 and it was 98.4. Still normal but I was running warmer than usual. It took a long time to get ready and despite hot water in the shower I was freezing. i got dress and debated going to work. Got in the car at 6:45 and my drive to work is 30 minutes. 1/2 way into my drive I got very sweaty again and went home to change my clothes because they were too warm. Got to work around 7:20 and still felt warm but they take our temps at the door and min was still okay, no fever. I drank a lot of water and ate, and at 8:30 am all of a sudden the exhaustion was gone and I felt normal. I got home form work at 5:30p and took a 3 hour nap and felt normal again.

                                                I suddenly became lightheaded and had extreme weakness, then collapsed, then immediately began having chest pain and pressure, shortness of breath, arm numbness, and uncontrollable shaking. All of these symptoms happened at the same time. We called the paramedics but all my vitals were totally normal. The severe symptoms passed after about three hours. I continued to have chest pain and pressure, but was able to breathe normally and had 100% oxygen saturation. I am not a smoker and don&#39;t have asthma or any breathing issues so the sudden inability to breathe coupled with the other symptoms all at once was very alarming.

I tried to drink some water and my husband and I tried to walk to the tent for observation. I fell down and fainted. I was wheeled in a wheelchair to the ER and vital sign and blood sugar and EKG were performed. I declined being admitted to the hospital for further investigation.

                                                I had shot and sat to be observed at 8:30 am.  After about three minutes I felt a wave of adrenaline type feeling wash over me and my heart raced and I felt really out of it/fearful.  I sat for a minute hoping it would pass, and it didn&#39;t so I asked for help.  EMT gave me pulse check and blood pressure, both were very very high (don&#39;t know what) and irregular so they brought ECG.  The ECG was also irregular.  I felt disoriented and had waves of heat/blood racing/pulse racing.  I was taken by ambulance to  Hospital.  Within 2.5 hours I was feeling better, not recovered but not as acute.  They did another ECG, still irregular and did some blood draws which seemed to satisfy the Dr.  that nothing was acute.  Once I had returned to a more normal level they released me.  Tonight at home I still have a bit of a racy clammy feeling but have felt more stable thus far.  It was an awful, scary feeling and it come on in just two or three minutes after shot.

                                                Had a sore arm within hour of shot (got it at 7:30pm). Felt a little yucky before going to bed. I made sure to hydrate significantly before the shot and after. I woke up at 3am with chills and had them for about an hour.  Woke up the next morning at 9am with with medium neck and head pain and feeling a little chilly and out of it. Mild ache in joints and body overall. At 10am I took one ibuprofen, but at 11am (200mg), kept pushing fluids. 11am headache got worse temp 98.7 (slightly high for me, I am usually about 97). Started having some gastrointestinal issues around noon. Felt nausea and sweaty palms loss of appetite. Had a bowel movement (normal in appearance).    That all seemed to pass and I felt better, still tired, for most of the afternoon. Arm was sore to the touch and when moving. I managed to eat a few small meals, kept up hydration, and took a nap late in the day. I woke up at 5pm with headache and body aches all over. No appetite again. Had very little to eat, kept hydrating,    At 7pm my vision got a little blurry and I had a minor vasovagal episode. Center of vision blurred, got chills and sweaty, nausea, and I had to poop  (it was less formed). I rested, cool compress, and raised my feet. It all passed in about 20 minutes. I had major loss of appetite rest of the night (couldn&#39;t eat anything), kept hydrating, and went to bed.  Slept through the night with no incidents.   Woke up at 9am second day and had a small breakfast, though my appetite is still not back. Generally feeling exhausted, but no headache or aches in the body anymore. My arm is still sore. Had some more GI distress (another less formed poop around 11am).   My appetite returned by early afternoon on the 2nd day post-vaccine. Still tired and generally feeling &#34;off,&#34; especially mentally. Had brain fog all afternoon and my ears felt plugged today. Hard to concentrate on a task.

                                                On April 8th at 4am, I woke up feeling a strong pain in my heart / esophagus region. I was alone and out of town and didn&#39;t know what to do, so I just sat in the hotel bed and waited for morning to come. I didn&#39;t know if i was having a heart attack or if it was gas from drinking soda the previous day. I went to work. At work, the left side of my tongue suddenly started swelling and a tingling and numbness set in my upper lip. I was very scared, rushed to the drugstore and bought GasX, Ricola drops (my throat was slightly sore, too) and Allegra 24 hours. I immediately took the Allegra pill but still went to the hospital. When getting to the parking of the hospital, though, the anti-allergic started kicking in and the tongue started getting back to normal, so I went back to work and didn&#39;t enter the hospital. I was ok for a while. Hours later, rashes started showing all over my body. Starting in my arms then under my breasts. On the night of the 8th, I even had fever and chills. Still, I had to go to work so it was a real nightmare. I also had diarreah. I then went to the drugstore again and also bought regular and night Advil, lots of water and electrolytes drink, Peptobismol and Benadryl (only Allegra was not enough). The following day, April 9th, the rashes started spreading all over my body, the fever was only being controlled by Advil. I flew back to Miami and was bedridden until the April the 11th. On the night of April the 11th I still woke up with very strong headache and on the 12th spent the day with a headache, but since have gotten better.

I felt clear headed but exhausted for the rest of the day.  My chest has been tight and congested since then. Hard to breath and my voice is rough and raspy. This is ongoing and I still have chest tightness and a raspy voice.  On 4/12/21 I started having horrible joint and muscle aches again throughout my body and felt so tired. Horrible headache and stomach pain, bloating and nausea.

                                                Chills/shaking began approximately 8 hours after injection.  Other symptoms of an achy upper body, temperature of 103.1, and nausea came shortly after initial symptoms (within 1 hr.).    In the middle of the night, I began heavily sweating (something I have never experienced).  I was drenched with sweat and needed to change in the middle of the night.   Absolutely no energy and a horrible headache.    24 hrs. after the injection I no longer had a high fever.  However, consistently for a week, every day, I had at least one symptom (headache, nausea, chills, or lack of energy) at some point throughout the day.  When I received the injection, I was on day 2 of my period.  It ended one day later than normal.  However, what was not normal was that on 4/3/21, I began to bleed again.  I passed 2 clots and had spotting for an additional 5 days.  This is in no way normal to my cycle.

Experienced blackout segments. Took 1 dose of 100mg Sumatriptan at about 930pm and tried to sleep w/the immense pain. Took 2nd dose at about 12am. Pain did not dissipate but fell asleep. When i woke up pain was gone but felt very sore, dizzy and disoriented. Fast forward to April 9th while laughing uncontrollably the right side of my face spasmed/cramped  closing my right eye and contracting my right cheek as if having Bell&#39;s Palsy. I have never experienced this before. Face did not continue to droop but has left a tick/twitch sensation under my right eye.

                                                I went on Sunday March, 14, 2021  to get the Johnson and Johnson shot offered through the school system.  I noticed that my blurred vision intensified.  I went to the eye doctor 3/16 and that is where they found blood clots behind my right eye close to my center.  I was referred to a Retinol specialist 3/26/21 and sent me to get  a physical to check for diabetes.  It had started to heal a little. There was not clear diagnosis on what could have been causing the the blood behind my eye.  4/2/2021 Went for physical at PCP and results of physical was good with no Diabetes.

                                                About six hours after the vaccine I had a headache. I woke up during the night with all over body aches that were very painful. I also had a headache and fever of 100-102 degrees. I was in bed for three days and I was still very fatigued for a whole week. My hands and legs were swelling off and on. I also had some shortness of breath, coughing and chest pain. I was dizzy and lightheaded. I have been very uncomfortable and unable to sleep. I still have tingling and pain in my feet. I get easily winded and I am still experiencing headaches. It has been almost three weeks. My feet and hands are still swelling and my hands are very red. I am seeing my doctor today for a breathing treatment. Everything seems to be slowly improving but the headaches are still coming and going. I have a weird feeling of bubbles all over.

The x-ray didn&#39;t show anything however my cbc was of concern and she also did a d timer.  It came back elevated,  so she sent me over for a CAT scan with contrast. It showed pneumonia in my upper and lower right lung and also my lower left lung. She sent me home to try and treat it there. Over the weekend I felt worse and my husband took me to the ER.  Upon arrival my blood pressure was 160 over 120 and heart rate was 140. They admitted me to the hospital for treatment of sepsis and pneumonia and pain management. I was there for 4 days. I was released on the 22nd of April and I am still feeling all of these effects on my body. Headache that I have not been able to get rid of even with the help of  prescription medication.

                                                The first few days, I had flu-like symptoms. After I got the vaccine - my migraines became very severe - they would last for days. They became unmanageable and I had to go to ER.  I have asthma - it&#39;s a lot harder to breathe - this is on and off. It used to be once in awhile I need my inhaler but now I need to use it more. It feels like I&#39;m catching my breath a lot more now.. My rashes went away - but I had had rashes (random places - arms/legs) that came and went for the first two weeks after the vaccine. I went to hospital ER on the 12th of April - because my migraines were so bad that my blood pressure went up to 200 something and they had to clear me to make sure I wasn&#39;t having a stroke. I have always had migraines but the only thing different that has changed the severity is the vaccine. I just finished off the steroids&#39; - Progesterone that the neurologist (at ER)(the one that called the cold stroke) prescribed to me. But that didn&#39;t really help. I&#39;m waiting for approval from insurance for another medication. Saw another neurologist - after the ER visit.

She was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Platelet count normalized 9 days after admission.  She underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement 11 days after admission and was extubated 4 days later, then transferred out of the ICU 2 days after that.  Course complicated by pulmonary embolism diagnosed 4 days after she left the ICU which is being treated with apixiban.  She has a right hemiparesis and continues to have dysphagia and dysarthria.  She is dependent on NG feeds for nutrition.  Anticipate discharge to long-term acute care within the next 2-3 days.

                                                Was diagnosed with a DVT 3.5 weeks after vaccination. Started experiencing symptoms of DVT 20 days after the vaccine. Symptoms were not atypical and were almost not checked for DVT at ER.  Started with twinges in my right leg for several days. Then pain in my back right behind my heart. Then developed sporadic chest pain and heart palpitations. I was afraid to go to the ER because of COVID because my 12-year-old daughter has a heart condition.  Then on April 30 mid-day my right thigh began to hurt like a  pulled muscle although I had not injured it or pulled it. I couldn&#39;t walk on my leg the pain was so intense. My family was very worried about a blood clot because of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. That night I had really sharp chest pains and my thigh pain was no better by the next morning. I went to the ER told them my symptoms. After the ER doctor examined me he said he was 99% sure I didn&#39;t have a blood clot because my pain was in my thigh and there was no redness or swelling. He told me my chest pain was probably due to anxiety. I asked if he would check my leg anyway. Once the ultrasound of my leg was done the DR came back and said I had a DVT. Then I had to have an MRI of my chest which he told me was a lot of radiation. I did not have a PE. They did not prescribe Heparin because they felt the DVT was from the vaccine. So I was giving Eliquis. Since then my family DR has run more tests and I do not have any genetic reason to have the DVT. I do not and have not taken birth control in the past 20 years. I am now on a blood thinner for at least 90 days if not longer and I am continuing to have twinges and chest pain twinges.

                                                Had a few cocktails and I blacked out, was highly sensitive to the alcohol. I was throwing up for two hours. I couldn?t move. I couldn?t stop the overwhelming need to vomit. I would try and lay down and was in pain. I ended up telling my partner to call an ambulance after two hours of being in such pain. We were across the street from a hospital so we drove. I was given fluid and blood work was done. I left before receiving the results. I couldn?t stand another minute lying there freezing. The machine that was monitoring me kept beeping quickly. I was able to get home and I slept for 12 hours and woke up feeling achy and was having hot flashes for a few hours.

                                                The first symptom I noticed was extreme brain fog and forgetfulness. Then, 6 days after the vaccine, I started having terrifying episodes of acute dysautonomia and panic attacks that included dissociation. These episodes persisted intermittently for 3 weeks. Between the episodes, I was extremely fatigued, brain dead, and unable to concentrate, with a fine resting tremor and constant heart palpitations. I am finally getting treatment from a chiropractic neurologist for subacute encephalitis that caused the dysautonomia and limbic system derangement. A month later, I am still restricted in my activities and have some remaining symptoms of ANS and brain dysfunction, but I am getting better.

                                                That night, starting around 11:00, I started getting chills and feeling abnormally fatigued and achy. Pretty quickly, the chills got really violent and I felt really bad; like I had the flu. I noticed I was having trouble breathing. I have had anaphylaxis in the past before this. I did have a fever, it was low. I was up most of the night - bad night sweats; hurt all over, couldn&#39;t sleep as I was really miserable. The next day, I took Tylenol - around 03:00 am, but the next day I couldn&#39;t get out of bed and I had really violent chills, fever, body aches and headache was coming and going. I was still having trouble breathing. I took one Tylenol twice that day - one in the late morning and one in the evening sometime. Two days post vaccination, I started feel less bad, I still had a bit of a headache and I still had trouble breathing - chest was really tight. I was very low energy. I finally contacted my doctor after four days with trouble breathing. He told me to take an Advil or Tylenol and thought it was allergic response to vaccine. I took an Advil. The tightness decreased a bit. Didn&#39;t go away but noticeably better. The tightness was just continuing. The next day all the news came out about J&amp;J vaccine, I called the doctor to tell him I was still having chest tightness and trouble breathing and they told me to call my PCP because they couldn&#39;t get me in. I called my PCP and she called back 2 hour later and I had just seen her the day before the vaccine and everything was very good that day she had seen me with oxygen, etc. . I went and go a pulse oximeter at Target - it came back at 100% and it would vacillate between 90-100%. My oxygen seemed fine. I thought it was a mass cell reaction to the vaccine  - that&#39;s what I felt - and I continued to take Advil every so often. It was about a week post vaccine when the tightness in my chest finally normalized. I continued to have fatigue. I felt pretty bad for two weeks post vaccine - tired, blah, and flared up with my disease and run down but no trouble breathing after about a week.

                                                I woke up with a pounding headache, body aches, and chills after getting the vaccine. I had Covid a year ago and I just felt like I was having Covid again. Having had Covid before it really scared me to have it again. My eyes were getting blurry. The other symptoms subsided but not the headaches. They gave me migraine medication, but it did not touch it at all, I almost feel like it is brain damage. After a month of this constant headache my husband and I have been having weird heart palpitations. I had an EKG and they said my heart was working ok. We were having weird things. The head aches never went away. After a month I started getting vertigo and it got worse and worse. I went into the doctor and told them about the vertigo and headache. They checked out my ears and they said there was no infection. I went to an audiologist and did a nerve testing and they said I had acute nerve damage and I had lost 44% of hearing in my ear. It just kind of happened fast. I have been going to vestibular therapy trying to get my balance back. I also had an MRI on my brain for an unrelated issue and they said there was nothing wrong in my brain that could cause this.

These 3 symptoms (chills, nausea, hot spells), along with the fatigue, were so strong that I was unable to do most of my daily activities on 4/8.   I felt only about 50% functional on 4/9 and I&#39;m mostly OK today.       *Fever: none *Heart rate:  frequently elevated about 20 beats per minute from my baseline

I had severe chills (it felt like my muscles were all contracting as I lay in the fetal position trying to stay warm). Over the course of about 12 hours (starting with the onset of the fever) I experienced nausea, vomiting, headache, cough and elevated heart rate. According to my apple watch my heart rate hit 140 at points. It was over a 100 for quite some time. My resting heart rate is usually in the 70s. The worst of my symptoms were experienced for 12-14 hours from the onset of the fever (5:30 PM 4/10/21 - 7:00AM 4/11/21.  4/11/21 7:00am - the rest of 4/11/21 i experienced fatigue, headache (though less severe) and had no appetite. I vomiting a couple more times early in the day, and had trouble keeping water down unless it was a sip at a time. Mild body aches. Fever hovered at 99-100 most of the day.  elevated resting heart rate  4/12/21 mostly symptom free but for fatigue and elevated heart rate  As of today, 4/13/21, I am still experiencing  a slightly elevated resting heart, mid 80&#39;s.

Pharmacist was asking if the patient is okay and the patient stopped responding so the pharmacist kneeled over to pick up the patients head and she looked flushed, her eyes were bulging and she began to sweat. The pharmacist asked the technician to call 911, asked the patient if she could breathe and the patient said yes but said she is not feeling well. She kneeled back over and the pharmacist was holding her hand telling her to continue breathing. The patient was very sweaty continued to breathe heavily. About two minutes passed and the patient was expressing she was feeling better and better as the pharmacist was speaking to her. The EMTs arrived 7 minutes after the call the patient had sat up already and was speaking and feeling alert.  She expressed that she felt like she was underwater and the pharmacists voice was fading during the minutes after the shot and she felt like her heart was racing. She explained that she suffers from anxiety.  The EMTs took her blood pressure when the patient was sitting and standing up, blood pressure was in normal range and also checked her blood glucose with a finger stick which was also in normal range. The patient had mentioned previously that she biked to the pharmacy. Later on the pharmacist called to check on the patient she said that she is feeling well and biked back home.

                                                Immediately after the JANSSEN vaccine I felt tenderness in my jaw that lasted for about two days. My body was sore, my Legs felt like I was having cramps ?growing pains? I also was experiencing allergy/asthma like symptoms that included difficulty breathing and shortness of breath that worsened over time I couldn&#39;t speak in full sentences or laugh I was unable to walk 10 steps without gasping for air, after a couple of days of trying to maintain and cope with my theses symptoms. I couldn?t take it anymore, as I was preparing myself to go to the emergency room. I got into the shower the steam from the shower felt like it was suffocating me and I passed out my children took me out of the bathtub and rushed me to the emergency room where I was given several tests that include x-ray, CAT scan, artery bloodwork and vein bloodwork. I was being treated for asthma and given several different breathing treatments and steroids, unable to keep my stats at a decent level and the hard rebound even after continuous treatments, I was admitted because the breathing treatments were not effective. I am still uncertain of the ?actual outcome? the Hospital doctors treated me for an asthmatic episode and gave me directions how to handle my asthma i was prescribed prednisone and referred  to my primary that would then refer me to a pulmonologist and cardiologist. At the hospital I was told that there was black spots on my lungs I was told that I was being treated for infection, but then also told it could be pneumonia no certain  answer was ever given and i was given and antibiotic and was also told that I needed to see my primary for a way to maintain my asthma. The antibiotics seem to work for a couple of days and again I&#39;m back to having difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, muscle pain soreness and mild lingering headaches.

                                                ? Acute CVA (cerebrovascular accident)  Hospital Course/test results:  Work up with MRI showed 2 small acute infarcts in R temporal lobe region, and findings which could represent subacute infarcts in L frontal lobe.  Neuro deficits now resolved.  Neurology consulting.  Suspicious for embolic phenomenon.  She does also have a IUD to treat her menorrhagia, which may predispose her to clotting.  However when we did further research Mirena IUDs were not found to raise the risk for blood clot-related heart attack and strokes but the company does recommend clinical consideration for removal in such situations. We contacted  OBGYN oncall physician and spoke to doctor today. From his recommendation is not to remove the IUD at present time because the risk is very low comparing to the higher risk of severe menorrhagia that patient had experienced in the past. Since she will have annual visit with her GYN at OBGYN, patient should have that conversation with her GYN for options.    Patient remains stable and symptoms free. Repeated brain MRI and new MRV did not reveal new findings. Her HA resolved on its own. She was initially started statin and full dose of ASA then changed to low dose ASA plus Plavix (21 days) then ASA as monotherapy after. Currently hypercoag panel is still pending. Echo showed no evidence of intracardiac shunting with fair quality and technically adequate study. Neurology recommended outpatient follow up with neurologist and 30 days heart monitor to look for Afib/flutter. Currently her headache is resolved as well R hand weakness/tingling is resolved. She is stable to go home today.    A1C is 7.3 while on Metformin (2000mg daily). She may need additional agent to get A1C &lt; 7 as outpatient.    Neuro also recommended outpatient sleep study.

                                                The first two days I had a normal reaction with fatigue and soreness.  On the second night I developed a severe sinus issue that caused my tongue to turn white/gray and be dry and sore.  Frequent diarrhea, headache, sore throat, soreness, low grade fever for half a day and a resulting acid reflux condition. (I have never had acid reflux before) I was tested for Covid and Strep, both negative. Continued lymph node sensitivity for two weeks.  3.5 weeks in, I developed muscle tension, unrelenting, from the back of my head all the way down my spine. I had continued chest pressure and some numbness on my left side in my arm, leg and later my face. No home remedies worked and rarely do I get back/neck/shoulder pain. I was not doing anything strenuous. I went to the ER where they tested me for blood clots (J&amp;J news had just come out and I have a family history) and prescribed valium for the muscle tension which has somewhat helped.   I fully recognize that this might be bad luck, a series of unfortunate events after I received my shot.  However, I have not been sick all year, I have never had acid reflux issues or pain like this in my neck/back/shoulders previously.  The fact that in the 4 weeks after the shot I have not had a single day where I felt normal is a red flag to me. I feel like it is worth reporting in case anyone else has had a similar experience.

She  underwent CTA which did not show any embolism, thrombus, dissection.  The  radiologist did note mild beading of the bilateral renal arteries, however the  radiologist at Valley View reviewed the images as well and was not as convinced.      Left renal infarct: Given suggestion of mild feeding of the bilateral  renal arteries, patient underwent CTA of the chest, head and neck which did not  show any other signs of fibromuscular dysplasia.  Echocardiogram did not have  any thrombus or decrease in function.  Patient did not have any arrhythmias on  telemetry.      Blood cultures were ordered and pending on discharge, but patient did not have  any of endocarditis      A hypercoagulable work-up including factor V Leiden, protein C, protein S,  Antithrombin, lupus anticoagulant, beta-2 microglobulin, anticardiolipin  antibodies were all sent and are pending at the time of discharge      Discussed the case with hematology at hospital: Most experts  treat with 3 months of anticoagulation other evidence is not entirely clear and  aspirin 81 mg may be a reasonable choice.  In light of the patient&#39;s lack of  insurance, decision was made to treat with 1 month of apixaban followed by 81  mg of aspirin daily indefinitely      Discharged with a short course of oxycodone 5 mg #15

It had the appearance and consistency of vegemite or molasses. Black sludge. At first it was extremely heavy with very large black clots. Then it became tiny little black clots suspended in a brown sludge. This continued for 6 days until 04/18. Then on 04/19 my menstruation turned bright red with no clots, but has not abated at all for another 4 days. I am currently today on Thurday 04/22 still bleeding almost 2 weeks after taking the J&amp;J shot. I cannot believe I am still bleeding after 10 full days!!! Never in 30 years of menstruating have I had a 10 day period. I am very scared and upset.

                                                As soon as I took the vaccine shot I had an immediate headache, after taking the vaccine I took Tylenol and slept in the rest of the day. The next day I woke up and my arm was red and swollen. I was running fever, still had the headache and now blurry vision. My entire body was hurting. My left side of my body felt numb and tingling. The next two days the pain became worse. I did not really have an appetite. When I did eat I could barely hold my food down. On Wednesday morning I could barely get out of bed, I also felt extreme pain in my lower legs, stabbing pain in stomach and right lower side. I also had ringing in my ears, more in the right ear. I then notice a bruise on my left leg, that it was not originally there, and was also tender to touch. I went to the emergency room on the same day and I was admitted. I was in there for 4 days, they tested my leg and stated it was not a blood clot, although it look and felt like one. They discharge me and advise me that it was a migraine that was causing all my pain.  This was on Sunday, I had a follow up with my PCP on the Friday, however to being in so much pain and shortness of breath, and arm pain I was advise to go to the ER on the Thursday and was admitted again. I was told in the ER I had a blood clot in my right arm and it was most likely from the IV from the previous visit. My blood pressure and heart rate was so high that they put me on medication. No matter the pain medication they gave me, it would not completely take the pain away. They discharge me again on Monday and after me begging them to get run any and all test, they said they found nothing. I&#39;m still in the same amount of pain and same symptoms, still having trouble keeping my food down. The only thing that changed is my left arm is not as sore, however I still have a huge knot and its still warm to touch. I don&#39;t know what else to do that is why im contacting the CDC for help. I&#39;m in a extreme amount of pain and pounding headaches.  Please help

Went to primary who detected a drop in oxygen levels, was then sent to ER where many tests were done.  Included chest scan, to look for clots.  None were found.   Took dramamin for vertigo which helped.  Symptoms of nausea, headache, vertigo continue to persist off and on.  On Friday 4/23 I died my hair.  Within 2 minutes an allergic reaction too place: sudden nausea, some shaking, headache.  Took benedryl which help.  At this point, I have continued bouts of nausea and no appetite.  Its been close to a month and I&#39;m really scared for my health.  I was completely healthy before.

Also, my lying down heart rate was 130, which is 50-60 bpm higher than normal  April 11: A fever between 100 and 101 all day. Took a Tylenol in evening.  April 12: Fever, headache gone. Just a little tired and fatigued. Then I seemed to have been recovered.  April 21-22: Achiness, tingling pain in arms, left back, shoulders.  Then this seemed to have abated.  April 28-29: Tingling pain in arms, hands, sometime back and feet.  I have never experienced these symptoms pre-vaccine so it makes me wonder if it is related to the vaccine

                                                I did have leg injury in April - and ever since the vaccine, I  now have an issue with swelling that won&#39;t stop - still have swelling. I was checked with blood clots - and it was elevated so they gave me an ultrasound in leg - no blood clot. Swelling on right leg was enlarged after the vaccine. Two missed menstrual cycles; now I have had the cycle but it&#39;s a longer cycle than I normally would have. It&#39;s abnormal - the length and flow is off. Spotted for a week before I started bleeding. I had slightly elevated blood pressure after the vaccine - 117/83 usual  but it was elevated 141/95 - and it&#39;s never high ever like that before. So they had thought I had a potential blood clot. Have an upcoming doctor&#39;s appt scheduled.

                                                The morning after I received the vaccine, I started having chest pressure and acid reflux. There was a hard pressure in my chest and my heart was beating weird. I started to develop a headache. I had low blood pressure a couple days later. I went to the clinic and they said I may have a blood clot. I also went to Hospital and they took some blood and did an X-ray and they told me I was fine. I was told that it may be anxiety or stress. The chest pain started to go away, but now my teeth are hurting and are sensitive. I feel that the adverse event lasted for three weeks.

It was found on my left foot plantar region (bottom of my foot). A few days after the vaccine I had swelling on the top and bottom of my left foot. I got two vascular images completed and the MRI was never sent to the vascular department. My podiatrist confirmed the blood clot on an ultrasound. I&#39;m still experiencing swelling.

Talked/deep breathed my way out of fainting. Within 10 minutes all the above symptoms started to lessen. 15 minutes after receiving the injection, the near fainting experience was over and I was comfortable leaving and driving. But the 10 minutes were terrible and I came very close to passing out. My husband experienced the exact same symptoms 2 days later. I will be reporting that immediately following this submission.

                                                THE PATIENT CAME TO THE PHARMACY TO BE VACCINATED FOR COVID-19, WITH JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON, ON FRIDAY, MAY 21, 2021 AT ROUGHLY 2PM.  I GAVE HER THE VACCINATION IN HER DELTOID MUSCLE ON HER LEFT ARM.  SHE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY COMPLAINED OF DISCOMFORT AND ASKED IF I HAD A COLD PACK.  I PROVIDED HER WITH ONE, WHICH SHE USED WHILE WAITING THE 15 MINUTE POST-VACCINATION OBSERVATION TIME.  SHE LEFT THE PHARMACY WITHOUT INCIDENT.  ONLY A COUPLE HOURS LATER, SHE CALLED THE PHARMACY TO REPORT ERYTHEMA AT AND AROUND THE INJECTION SITE.  I DID NOT KNOW AT THAT TIME WHETHER THE ERYTHEMA WAS DUE TO THE COLD PACK OR IF IT WAS A VACCINE-INDUCED RASH, SO I INSTRUCTED HER TO TAKE A DOSE OF ANTIHISTAMINE.  AS SHE HAD CETIRIZINE IN THE HOUSE, SHE TOOK THAT.  SHE WAS HOME WITH HER HUSBAND.  I RECOMMENDED HE KEEP AN EYE ON HER AND IF SHE DEVELOPED ANY ADDITIONAL SYMPTOMS OR WORSENING RASH, SHE SHOULD GO TO THE HOSPITAL FOR EVALUATION.  ADDITIONAL SYMPTOMS INCLUDED SWELLING, TROUBLE BREATHING, WHEEZING, CHEST OR THROAT TIGHTNESS, OR HIVES.  THOUGH SHE DID NOT EXPERIENCE ADDITIONAL SYMPTOMS, SHE DECIDED TO GO TO UCONN HEALTH CENTER ER IN FARMINGTON.  THEY DID BELIEVE THE RASH WAS VACCINE-INDUCED BUT DID NOT FEEL SHE REQUIRED ANY ADDITIONAL TREATMENT AND DISCHARGED HER (I.E., NO EPINEPHRINE).  THE PATIENT NOTED THAT HER BLOOD PRESSURE AT THE ER WAS HIGHER THAN &#34;HER NORMAL&#34; AT 152/95.  THE FOLLOWING TWO DAYS, THE RASH STAYED THE SAME AND WAS DESCRIBED BY THE PATIENT AS THE &#34;WORST SUNBURN SHE&#39;S EVER HAD&#34;.  SHE ALSO HAD NORMAL SIDE EFFECTS OF BODY ACHES AND CHILLS/SWEATS.  ON MONDAY, 5/24/21, SHE FOLLOWED UP WITH HER PCP.  HE AGREED WITH THE HOSPITAL THAT THE RASH WAS VACCINE-INDUCED AND TOLD HER THAT HE DIDN&#39;T WANT HER GETTING ANY COVID-19 VACCINES IN THE FUTURE.  HE DID BLOODWORK TO RULE OUT PLATELET ISSUES, WHICH, PER PATIENT, WERE NORMAL; SHE NOTED THAT HER RBC&#39;S AND HEMATOCRIT WERE SLIGHTLY ELEVATED.  HER PCP GAVE HER A MEDROL DOSEPAK FOR THE RASH. THE PATIENT IS RECOVERING.  I BELIEVE IT IS WORTH NOTING, HOWEVER, THAT THE PATIENT APPLIED THE COLD PACK DIRECTLY TO HER ARM FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME AND DID NOT PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO EITHER THE ER OR HER PCP.  SHE SENT ME A PHOTO OF HER ARM WHICH SHOWS GENERALIZED ERYTHEMA (THE SIZE OF THE COLD PACK) - THE ONLY PART THAT IS COMPLETELY NORMAL IS THE SKIN BELOW THE BAND-AID.  I BELIEVE THE PATIENT CREATED AN ICE BURN BY USING A COLD PACK TOO DIRECTLY, FOR TOO LONG, AND THAT THE UNDER BAND-AID AREA WAS NOT RED BECAUSE IT PROTECTED THE SKIN FROM COLD BURN.  I SUGGESTED TO THE PATIENT THAT SHE RUN THIS THEORY BY HER PCP, AS I BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT &#34;MISSING INFORMATION&#34;, THAT COULD POTENTIALLY CHANGE THE DIAGNOSIS AND ALTER HIS RECOMMENDATION TO AVOID FUTURE COVID VACCINATION.  WHETHER OR NOT THE PATIENT CONTACTED HIM AGAIN IS UNKNOWN.

                                                I had chest pains a few days after receiving the vaccine and  went to see my Doctor who referred to the ER to check to see if I had a blood clot.

                                                Immediate dizziness. Arm felt like dead weight. Had trouble driving to waiting area. Within 20 minutes, chest, neck, arms, and face tightened, I couldn?t move my arms, paramedics found blood pressure to be very high. Was light headed for 48 hours after. Almost fell over multiple times. Arms and legs very heavy and tired easily.  On 4/21/2021 my leg cramped up and went numb. Week later my chest constricted with same issue from injection day. Went to hospital. Blood pressure again elevated.  Concerned of a blood clot, did chest mri and ultrasound of blood vessel in leg. No blood clot found, but new lesions in chest were found and no explanation of leg issues.  As of today?s date, no one can figure out why my right leg is numb from mid thigh down, but has major pain and causing me not to be able to walk and go up stairs.  Feels like a constant charley horse in my calf with pain radiating through my knee and up my thigh. No injury was sustained. It happened all of the sudden while laying on the couch reading.  I?ve seen regular doc, pt specialist, sports med doc, headed to a spine specialist next. No explanation of strange pain and numbness.

Patient stated no issues and to proceed. When asked if there were any allergies or adverse effects from previous vaccine administrations, patient stated no issues at all. Once vaccine was administered, the patient immediately broke out in a deep sweat, and fainted. I immediately had one of my techs call 911, during this time patient started to seize/convulsions. We had patient at an angle while patient was convulsing. Once patient stopped convulsing, patient gasped for air and regained consciousness. I asked patient if she was doing ok and identified myself as the pharmacist. Patient stated that they remembered who I was but did not remember anything after the vaccine was administered. EMS was called and while they tried to set up a quick triage IV line, patient started to faint again but did not lose full consciousness. Patient was transported to ER.

                                                Had typical symptoms within 24 hrs - low grade fever (101F), body aches and arm pain.  On second day developed mild headache that went across forehead.  On 5/15/21, developed right ear pain - pressure in ear and headaches continued.  Intermittently the left ear would also have pain.  Started developing stiffness on the right side of neck that accompanied the ear pain.   Went to urgent care on 5/20/21.  Doctor said both ears were visibly full, especially the right ear.  Prescribed Azelastine nasal spray.  Called PCP in morning of 5/21/21, and was prescribed prednisone for 5 days to control inflammation.  Prednisone worked after a few days but was still run down and pain developed in my abdomen and along the right side of back/leg.  Went to ER on 5/24.21.  Doctors performed tests for blood clots.  Was told I was weak and dehydrated and given IV and pain meds. Was negative for blood clots but my IVC was dilated. Pains persisted for about 2 weeks - especially in the right abdomen.  Went to cardiologist on 6/4/21 and had a normal EKG but low BP.  Doctor believes abdominal pain is gastrointestinal and put me on proton pump inhibitor.  I am getting echocardiogram on 6/10./21 to check IVC.  Since then most pains have subsided except weak, right sided abdominal pain.  The right ear pain is back.  Starts in the morning with outer cartilage of ear getting inflamed, followed by pressure/pain in right ear, then pain in right neck.  Has been going on for a month now.  100% related to vaccine - came after vaccination and never had before.

I have stage 3 kidney disease so having high blood pressure can lead to kidney damage and/or kidney failure. At the end of April 2021, I was prescribed and reluctant to take medicine for high blood pressure, specifically Carvedilol (Coreg).  Around the same time, I began having hot flashes and premenopause symptoms.  I went to my gynecologist and my bloodwork revealed that my ovaries were barely functioning and I was in perimenoupause at the age of 42 years old!! Therefore, my doctor informed me that my chances of pregnancy and birthing a child were extremely slim.  This was devastating news.

                                                About ten minutes after leaving the vaccination site, I began feeling a strange dizziness; an internal wobbly-Jello-like sensation. I felt a pin/needle/ stabbing sensation on my left fingers, particularly on the dorsal side of the third and fourth fingers, and in the middle of the tongue. The tongue felt as if was receiving a subtle electric charge that immobilized it with every shock. It lasted about 5 minutes. My vision was blurry. After that, my mind was foggy.  At about midnight, flu-like symptoms began sudden, but they were the expected symptoms for a covid vaccine (fever, body aches, sweats, sore throat, severe headache, pain on injection site, etc.) However, the pin/needle/ stabbing sensation was felt throughout the body. It sometimes felt as if a bubble, waves, or something was moving inside of me, in different areas of the body (rib cage, legs, chest, arms, legs, face, and top of the head (like when a baby moves inside of a pregnant woman, without the visible bump). My body, head, and neck felt stiff.  Symptoms were milder after 48 hours, on and off, until 4/13/2021 when I felt a sunken feeling, like something dropped inside of me (sugar, blood pressure, blood rush, I do not know). The tense feeling of the body returned. I felt dizzy. Left arm and leg felt tingly. There were palpitations, but I think that it was due to being scared about all the other symptoms. I felt cold and was shivering. The head felt stiff again. I was very thirsty. In the following days, symptoms got milder. On 4/22/2021, at about 4pm, the sunken feeling returned, along with the dizziness, wave or bubble-like sensation through head, face, body. The wave-like sensation flashed across my face, head, and neck intermittently. It was hard to speak, pronounce words, and swallow. The tongue felt numb. It lasted about two hours. I felt exhausted, so I took a nap until 8pm. When I woke up, I felt like nothing had happened, no symptoms until 1:00 am.  At 1:00 pm, 4/23/2021, the sunken feeling, dizziness, palpitations, heavy breathing without shortness of breath, cold/shiver, blurred vision, the wave-like sensation, and pokes suddenly returned. The waves were more intense and felt like pressure on the right side of the head and left side of the chest. Went to the Emergency Room. With every wave of sensations, was accompanied by an urgency to urinate. I urinated like 3 times in a span of 30 to 45 minutes (full bladder). Findings were normal but symptoms continued through 4/24/2021, on and off. Each episode lasts anywhere from 1 to 4 hours.  Short lasting, mild symptoms returned Monday 04/26/2021, at night, until Wednesday 04/27. However, that Wednesday night, I felt a belt like, tight sensation around the left bicep and neck. It felt as if I was being grabbed by the left arm.  On 4/29/2021, around 5:00 pm, I called an ambulance because all symptoms had returned ?full force?, such as sunken feeling, blurred vision, dizziness (like passing out), intense head and left chest pressure (in waves, like having a huge fish or parasite inside the chest and head), numb mouth (like dental anesthesia), hard to speak (hard time sending the message from brain to mouth). It took great effort to speak and felt that I had to decide whether continue speaking or staying conscious. I also had blurred vision with the first sunken feeling. Symptoms continued 2 to 3 times a day. Since 4/29 a feeling of being inside of an elevator, airplane, or earthquake, and the numbness on the left side of chest and arm remain, even when no other symptoms are present. Also, both arms become numb while sleeping, every night, multiple times a night, since 4/29. Since then, I sleep on 3 pillows (two in my head, one on the shoulders to create an angle) to minimize the numbness of the arms and the head/neck pressure while sleeping.   On 5/5/21, symptoms began while car riding as a passenger and upper body felt tight. Strangely, symptoms ended when car stopped moving. Later that day, while walking through a department store, nostrils felt uneven, as if the left nostil were breathing cold air while the right was taking warm air. That night, symptoms intensified (the attack). Like all other times, urinating was too frequent while ?the attack? is present. This time, my body felt sore and tired (Flu-like). There was an intense pressure on the right side of the eye and forehead. The neck stiffness was intense.  For the past two weeks, ?attacks? have been less frequent, about 2 to 3 times a week, lasting a maximum of 2 hours. The numbness on the left side of the chest and arm continues. The feeling of something moving or pins/needles may appear sporadically throughout the day. At times, they feel like twitches. The woozy feeling of being inside of an elevator remains. Breathing still feels heavy, like trying to breathe with the face in front of a fan.  All test results from the 2 ER visits were normal, including the CT scan. A brain MRI, done on 5/5, was also normal. A 24-hour heart monitor also had normal results.

Friday the symptoms continued, particularly in the evening. I began monitoring my blood pressure Friday evening with the electronic arm cuff that we normally use. It is staying abnormally low, ranging between 105/68 - 109/70 on 4 different measures. My normal range stays between 115/78 at the lowest - 130/90 at the highest.  Today, all symptoms remain unchanged and blood pressure remains &lt;110/70

Told the nurses they took me back in a room took my vitals at that time I started to feel weak like my arms and legs were Jell-O or jelly. I also felt jittery the nurses gave me apple juice and crackers they put me in a private room they check my vitals again my heart rate was elevated and my blood pressure also went up . 02 That?s normalsats normal My feet are they just started to feel numb as well. A doctor came in and checked me out they felt like my exam was normal but they also felt like I might be having a mild reaction around 1500 I started to get itchy but no hives noted I took a Benadryl 25 mg at 1500 around 1515 my feet were still numb but I definitely felt better still kind of felt like my arms and legs were weak but not as bad so after an hour and a half I was allowed to leave and was told to rest for the rest The day and you call or go to the emergency room if I had trouble some side-effects about four hours after the shot  my lips did start tingling at home I did check my oxygen saturations and it was normal I look at my lips to make sure that they weren?t swelling the only thing I noticed was that a scar I have on my lip that usually you can?t see was more prominent and you could actually see it my lower back hurts a lot

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine, I felt pretty good. Just some soreness in arm and a minor headache an hour later. I took Tylenol and symptoms were bearable the rest of the day. By around 6 or 7p that night, I experienced full body pain and chills, similar to the flu. I also had some chest pain and tightness but attributed that to the overall body pain. I was also very winded and short of breath. I called my Primary Care Doctor to report this, and she said this was a normal reaction and it meant my immune system was working. It continued into the next day, and I took my temperature and had a 102 fever. I slept most of the day and was unable to work. I also had a severe headache. The next day, on Day 3, my flu symptoms were getting better; however, I felt dizzy and short of breath. I also fainted . This is the first time this has ever happened to me. I have never fainted in my life. My symptoms seemed to resolve after eating and drinking, so I figured it may have been dehydration. On Day 4, I was concerned because I was having shortness of breath and chest pain, along with dizziness. I could not take a deep breath without having pain. I called my Primary Care Doctor, and she told me she was concerned I might have covid and to go to the ER. I do not believe I have covid. No one in my household has these symptoms except for me. I believe it is from this vaccine. My chest pain/shortness of breath seemed to go away. for a bit so I did not go to ER. I&#39;m on Day 5 now, and the chest pain/shortness of breath has come back, so I decided  to report this because I do not listed on the list of common side effects for the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I joined a J&amp;J social media group where others are also reporting these symptoms, so I decided to report to Vaers. I also have had night sweats every day since taking the vaccine and my blood pressure is lower since taking the vaccine.

Physically moved slow, cognitively slowed down, inability to focus. Internal body-wide sensation difficult to define. All very similar to immediate effects I have from alcohol. Passed out (sleep) 9hrs later &amp; woke 100% fine at 8am.

I did go to the Dr. for a follow  up my heart was a little up and down but still within the normal wrong.  She told me to take a week off.

I woke up at about 05:00 am with a fever of 101.6. My heart rate was elevated - racing heart. I took some more Tylenol -and I tried to sleep but it was hard to. After a few hours, I felt achy and sore but better. Three days later, had a run of skipped heart beats (Thursday) and heart palpitations. I called my regular doctor on Monday and on Thursday, I called the Cardiologist. I take a beta blocker when I have bad heart palpitations and they continued to happen but were better with the beta blocker. Within a few hours, on Thursday, the symptoms resolved. I still have heart palpitations but the vaccine may have increased them.

The fever continued  through the night and broke around 3am.  The next morning I felt okay but by 10am started to run a fever again for the remainder of the day and chest pains and headache/body aches were now VERY present.  It is now 5 days after the shot and I?m just starting to feel like myself again. The headaches and overall body aches lasted for days.  I also had blurry vision on and off during this time.  My husband and I workout every day and eat very well.  We?re not overweight and don?t smoke. The injection site is still sore 5 days later.   I will complete another form for my husband but he experienced the EXACT SAME reactions....every one of them.

                                                I had a headache the next morning but no other symptoms initially.  Then, Saturday evening, just over 24 hours after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine I was sitting in landscape pavers outside in jeans and a long sleeve shirt next to the pool. My husband looked over and said what is wrong with your feet, they are blue. He said that is not good with circulation and you should probably talk to your doctor. Unfortunately I did not take a picture at the time and noted I was a little chilly but would reach out to my doctor if it continued and didn?t think anything more of it until I saw the reports Tuesday morning of them recommending to stop the J&amp;J vaccine.   I called my doctors office Tuesday morning and they asked me to come in over lunch to see the doctor. While sitting waiting to see the doctor my feel replicated the situation from Saturday  night. My toes were especially blue up through my ankle and the doctor pointed out I had red patches looking like a rash. She also noticed my right leg was worse and more swollen up to just below my knee. We did take pictures that we can share if prompted.

                                                It started as soon as I got the vaccine. I had a feeling of heat travelling down my arm followed by a pins and needles sensation. I stayed for 30 minutes and I could feel a strange feeling of pins and needles seemed to be travelling up my neck and into my face. When I saw that my arm was swollen. My arm started to itch and I was taken into the observation area and checked out. I went home and four hours later I felt like I couldn&#39;t take a deep breath and I started to get a headache, chills and fatigue. The next day my arm  and face were still little numb and I was still having a little trouble breathing. On day four I still felt like I couldn&#39;t take a deep breath and my heart rate was erratic. On the fifth day I went to an Urgent Care clinic. My blood pressure and heartrate were a little high. I went to the doctor the next day because they had found some hardening of my heart. After five weeks I still have a little feeling of pins and needles in my left arm and in the left side of my face.

Thought it would get better did not.  Went to Hospital Emergency Room on May 22, 2021.    D-dimer was elevated.  Dr was concerned about blood clots.  The hospital did a CT Scan of my chest with dye.  Did not find any evidence of clots.  I was released and told this could be a side effect of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination.  I was told to monitor if it doesn&#39;t go away or get worse follow-up on further investigation.  Was also told to report this side effect.  I still have the heaviness and pressure in my chest as well as a bit of breathing problems.

Over the next 72 hours, my headache worsened and a firefighter friend came to check my blood pressure.  It was 240/110 for the next 4 days.  I had not had blood pressure problems before.  I also developed a rash on my legs that appeared at hour 26 after the vaccine but resolved after 48 hours of the vaccine.   My heart was racing and extreme headache persisted.  My cardiologist saw me and put me on a heart monitor and had me record daily blood pressure numbers.  On day 18 after the vaccine all symptoms mysteriously resolved.  The doctor continued to monitor for 30 days total and then we decided if anything serious were to happen, it would have by then.  So monitoring discontinued.  I had not blood pressure problems before. Now its somewhat higher but within acceptable ranges (140/90 now)

                                                Sore arm immediately after receving the vaccine. On Friday 4/16, my left upper thigh had a throbbing pain, almost like a charlie horse. That continued for 2 weeks, alternating legs. It ended up becoming prominent in my left leg, so much so that I had an ultrasound on my left leg on 4/23/21. On 4/24/21 I got a sharp headache, the whole right side of my face went numb. On 4/26/21 I called my doctor to tell them what happened and they sent me to the ER.  I was in the ER for 16 hours. In the ER I had bloodwork, MRI and an ultrasound on left leg. I was discharged from the ER.  On 4/30/21 I started getting chest pain/burning sensation. I went to urgent care on 5/3/21 for it. I was given lidocaine to numb my esophagus to rule out heart related chest pain. They did an EKG of my heart as well.   I was sent home with pantoprazole. They diagnosed that it was heart burn related to the vaccine.  I went back to the urgent care 5/7/21 because the chest pain was worse. They did a chest xray, and told me to continue, pantoprazole, tylenol and mylanta and stated they did not see anything wrong with my heart.  After this I went to family doctor for a follow up closer to the end of May. The chest pain was still there and soft to the touch, along with pain (squeezing feeling) in my left arm.  Also, my armpits have been swollen. The doctors think I have Costochondritis. They tell me to take 2 tylenol every 4 hours. It does get better for about 2 weeks then 6/10/21 it comes back with the same symptoms. On 6/14/21 I go back to the doctor and was given a steroid for one week, the steroid alleviates the inflammation. When the steroid is done, the symptoms come back. The symptoms come and go, some days are better than others.

                                                At 5:30 pm, I started to have a headache, so I took some Tylenol.  I started to feel a little better.  From about 7:00 pm to about midnight, I felt awful.  I couldn&#39;t walk down a short hall without assistance.  I was so sore and achy I couldn&#39;t really sleep.  I felt insanely hot, yet had chills and I had a terrible headache.  I am type 1 diabetic, and my blood sugar spiked to over 200, where it hovered between 200 &amp; 300 most of the night, despite the fact that I used insulin to try and lower it.  From 10 pm to midnight, I felt nauseous.  Overnight was ok.  I still had some of those symptoms, but could sleep off and on.  I probably woke up every couple of hours.  I was till very sore and hot, but not as hot, and still had a headache.  Today, I took Tylenol this morning.  I still have a mild headache, sore body, tired and a little slow, but significantly better than last night.

Patient stated she started feeling nauseous and light headed so asked if she can wait outside for some fresh air. When she went outside, she sat on the edge of the stairs and fell backwards and passed out. The store manager was there to catch her before her head hit the pavement. Patient wasn&#39;t alert for about 2 minutes. Pharmacist came out and assessed the patient and she was communicative. She was in and out but was able to tell us her name, DOB and where she was. We sat her up,  gave her some water, and waited with her. She requested not to call the ambulance. I checked her pulse at 1:15pm and it was 92. I checked her pulse again at 1:30pm and it went down to 72. Patient was fully alert and speaking in full sentences by 1:35pm. She called her mom and was able to stand up without feeling dizzy. She walked to the car with assistance and was driven home by her mother.

In addition to the shaking, I ran a fever of 102 F, and my heart began racing - my husband is an RN and he checked my blood pressure which was normal and my heart rate which was 122 ( normal for me is about 72). Until about 6am my heart continued to race, and even with Advil and Tylenol my fever didn?t stop until  the next morning.    The next two days I felt pretty beat up, had a headache, and have been very tired.

STARTED TO EXPERIENCE NAUSEA, NUMBNESS AND TINGLY SENSATIONS, RASH ON ARMS, LEGS, SWELLING IN ELBOWS, KNEES, CHEST PAIN, CHILLS, SLIGHT SHORTNESS OF BREATH.  THESE SIDE EFFECTS PROGRESSED AND WERE WORSE 4 HOURS POST-VACCINATION.   THE DAY AFTER VACCINATION, AFTER REGISTERING WITH V-SAFE, A REPRESENTATIVE CALLED A.C.  AND TOLD HER TO TAKE 75 MG DIPHENHYDRAMINE.  THE REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT A.C.  WAS HAVING A MODERATE REACTION TO THE VACCINE (A.C. DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANAPHYLAXIS).  MOST OF THESE ADVERSE REACTIONS IMPROVED AFTER TAKING THE DIPHENHYDRAMINE.   TODAY, 2 DAYS POST-VACCINATION, A.C.  IS NO LONGER HAVING ANY SIDE EFFECTS AND IS RECOVERED.

Parked the car. Car was in park but still running. Attendant at the clinic instructed me to move my car forward. I put the car in Drive and as I moved forward I lost consciousness. Completely blacked out. Unconscious in the car, the car carried on moving forward and crashed in parked car. I came to once someone tried to wake me up. Presently have no smell and have been very tired with the chills. I was sweating in my sleep, shivering and woke up in a wet bed from all my sweat. The next day I am just weak.

                                                Within 5 minutes of shot I was nauseous on scale of 1-5 1 being hardly and 5 being Extremely I was 4. This remained at a 4 for over 36 hours. By 930 pm approximately 12 hours after shot I was running a Very high fever and had EXTREME chills, body aches, latharic and my arm hurt bad. There was no discoloration or swelling in the arm however. I expected these side effects but they were so much worse then expected or discribed. My husband had same effects. We are both very healthy and active young adults. This felt like a SEVERE 24 hour flu. Not, &#34;flu-like&#34;. I would be very afraid of we had ANY underlying health conditions. Also my heart had a cramping burning pain that came and went. No fluttering, it felt like the muscle was contracting around my heart or the actual heart was contracting and staying contracted for about 5 minutes at a time. This occured only to me and happened about 3-4 times withing the first 24 hours with the first experience while I was at the pharmacy being monitored for the 15 minute post shot. I have no known underlying heart issues and have never been diagnosed with any heart problems or been seen for any such issue. But it was real and it was scary.   I took 1, 500mg tylenol at 930pm the day of the shot for the fever and aches.  I took 1, 500mg tylenol at 9am the fallowing morning, as I was still experiencing aches and a low fever. It has been 48hours and I am still feeling lathargic. But more as expected.

                                                On Wednesday April 7  started to feel like she was getting a cold. Because her husband tested positive for Covid  April 6 and her daughter&#39;s were showing symptoms, she and her daughters were tested. All of their tests were positive. So her first positive test was April  7th  which was a PCR but was taking long to come back so she got a rapid test on April 9th and that was positive as well. She had cold like symptoms, a low grade fever that never went above 100.0 and cough for about 5 days.  She felt tightness in her chest but no shortness of breath and her pulse ox was 98-99. She took Tylenol every 6 hours as needed.  The cough and fever resolved after about 4 days but the nasal congestion is severe and very uncomfortable.  She also has a burning sensation of nose and no taste or smell. She is also very fatigued but able to maintain ADL&#39;s and care for her family.

                                                I felt very dizzy about  15 minutes after the vaccine.  The girl next to me that had just had it had a seizure so thought it was nerves at first. That went into pressure in my head, my tongue got numb and started to swell, started coughing up blood. I took prednisone and used my epipen. When I got home I was terrified to go to the hospital. The oral swelling subsided. The head pressure lasted at least 12 hours. My bp was real low (70/45). It did slowly come back up. Cough and chest congestion is still present. Brain fog. Fever lasted about 4 days.  This is the second report I?m putting in. I did not hear back on the last one submitted 4/8

                                                Lightheadedness and exhaustion set in 15-25 minutes post injection. Later that same evening, experienced nausea, muscle, bone, and joint aches as well as chest pain that were much reduced by the following morning. Malaise continued as did symptoms of nausea without vomiting.  24 hours post injection, experienced a low grade fever of 99.6 F (for me, this is a low grade temp). Fever broke after another 24 hours.  Experienced severe headaches in the middle of the forehead for 8-12 hours on 3/25/2021, 3/29/2021, 4/3/2021.  Experienced difficulty breathing 3/30/2021. Woke up from deep sleep feeling starved for oxygen and a sensation that a deep enough breath could not be taken--the lungs could  not expand enough. Respiratory rate seemed slightly depressed. It passed after about 30 minutes with focused effort on taking deep, regular breaths. Fell asleep again and did not consult a medical provider about it. The oxygen hunger / breathing issue did not repeat.  Medical professionals were not consulted for any of the episodes described above.

As the day went on, started feeling more soreness and headache. By 7 pm that night, I was extremely fatigued and nauseated. Pain very bad in my arm that night to where I could not sleep. Each day that has gone on, I have had worsening fatigue, headaches, and an increase in my heart rate, and a decrease in my blood pressure. I&#39;ve had an increase in brain fog and an increase in sleep issues. The pain in my arm went away after 4 or 5 days.

                                                On 04-07-2021- I experienced a lump on my neck and developed pain to both of my shoulders. I went to the ER where x-rays and lab work was done. X-rays showed that my lymphatic glands inflamed. I also experienced a cramps from my neck that radiated upwards to the base of my head. My pain was so intense that I took OTC Tylenol to help with my pain. I went again to the ER eight days later because I was having pain to my heart, chest, neck and shoulders and x-rays again demonstrated lymphatic glands inflamed and was told to take Ibuprofen for pain.   To this day I continue to have pain to my shoulders, neck and head but the pain is not as intense as before although the pain is still present daily. I can not work my full 8 hours of work due to my symptoms and can not over-exert myself in performing my daily tasks at work.

                                                I immediately felt sharp pain and burning in my arm while being injected. The burning in my arm lasted for about 20 minutes. I got a severe migraine about an hour after the vaccine that lasted for about ten hours.  I broke out in hives all over my body later that night, the same day as the vaccine. I also had intense heartburn. I never get heartburn so this is not normal for me. The following day, I was still having hives and started also having chest pains. I was consistently taking antihistamines to keep the hives under control. On Saturday morning, 2 days after the vaccine, I was still breaking out in hives. My throat also started to swell and I was having a hard time breathing. My heartburn was also getting more severe. I ended up going to urgent care. There I was prescribed 2 stronger antihistamines and prednisone to help with my reaction. I was also given an epi pen.  Later that night, I ended up going to the ER as I was having severe chest pain. I have a history of DVT so I was concerned about blood clots. I had several tests done along with a chest CT scan. Thankfully everything came back clear for blood clots and heart attack. The ER doctor could not explain why I was having chest pain and advised me to monitor it and to come back in if it got worse. The following day, I was still needing antihistamines for hives and difficulty breathing. I woke up in the middle of the night with severe stomach pain and cramping. I had intense vomiting and diarrhea. The diarrhea started to have a lot of blood in it. I went back urgent care and they sent me for a CT scan which showed I now had colitis. The bleeding lasted for about 3 days.

                                                After the 15 minute waiting period, I felt fine. I did my grocery shopping while I was at the store, went home and worked the rest of the day at my desk. We ran errands in the evening like normal. I hadn&#39;t really noticed because we were busy, but my heart rate had been steadily increasing all afternoon and into the evening. My watch tracks my pulse rate and reports on screen. After I took a shower at 9:30, I noticed that my pulse felt high. I laid down, thinking it was just from taking a hot shower and it would go back down to normal.  That&#39;s when I looked at my watch report and it looked like a stair step, with my heart rate increasing steadily every few hours, starting at 4 p.m. It was currently 110-120 (my normal RHR is 60, and drops into the 50s when I&#39;m asleep). I went to bed, hoping I was just in my own head about this and it would be fine. I woke at 2 a.m.  and my heart rate had not dropped below 100 while I was asleep and was at 130. I went to the ER at 2:00 a.m. because it was alarming. There were points where it spiked to 150 while sitting still. The ER ran an EKG, full blood and urine labs, monitored my heart rate and BP - my BP was in the normal range the whole time. The doctor who saw me in the ER was awesome. Her husband is still dealing with lingering neurological damage from having COVID last year. She informed me that I was not in a-fib or any type of cardiac distress and my labs were all normal, but was likely having an immune response to the vaccine.  They did a chest x-ray and CT to check for blood clots and both came back negative. My platelet count was well within normal range as well. I returned home about 6 a.m.  and my heart rate was still higher than normal, but had already started to work its way down. It stair-stepped down just like it went up and by 4 p.m., my RHR was back down to 70 and it was down in the 50s overnight. Aside from that, I had the typical headache, low-grade temp and overall body aches. Everything had subsided by Sunday afternoon. I did make an appointment see my PCP as instructed by the ER doctor on Tuesday, April 13. She had read all reports from the ER and was pleased with how my heart rate had come back down to normal. This was the same day that the authorities stopped use of the Jannsen shot due to the blood clot concerns. Dr ran another platelet count for my own peace of mind and it was a little higher than it was when I was in the ER, so she was confident that I was not in any danger, but did review the symptoms/warning signs of blood clots with me just in case.  I have not had any issues or symptoms since.

The morning  of 03/24/21 I woke up with full body aches, chills, and fever over 100 F. These symptoms lasted all day. Fever went up to 102 F.  Recently I have noticed a change in my menses since having the vaccine and I wonder if it is linked. I have been on birth control since last year to control heavy bleeding. It was helping very well. The period I had in April and May were like it was before I started the pill. It was heavy and I had numerous large clots. I will be scheduling an appt with my ob/gyn regarding this change.

No concomitant medications were reported.  On 20-MAY-2021 at 1:30, patient had very intense cold chills from hell and unable to focus. The next day the patient&#39;s sister had to help patient to stay upright in bed because patient kept falling over in bed and could not stay upright. The patient&#39;s sister was concerned and insisted that the patient go to the hospital to seek medical care but the patient refused. Patient then experienced periods of loss of consciousness and patient&#39;s sister was having a hard time waking patient up and then checked oxygen saturation and noted that it was low at 72%. The patient&#39;s sister subsequently managed to wake patient up and turned up patient&#39;s oxygen tank from a previous setting of 2 to a higher setting of 3. At this point the patient&#39;s sister managed to help patient sit up. The patient has been confused and dizzy and oxygen kept dropping and it will go back up then go back down. The patient then stated it was not as bad as it was, more like it was a side effect. The patient called doctor on 20-MAY-2021 at 19:30 and told what had happened and what was going on. The patient&#39;s doctor told patient she had hypoxemia and gave instructions to keep oxygen on and to see if patient was feeling better. Patient felt very confused and found hard to talk, very tired and not focused at that moment. Patient could not remember what was told 15 seconds ago. Patient had oxygen currently in the low 80s to 96 depending on the lungs. Patient started to fall and lean over. Patient&#39;s sister had a hard time waking up patient. After the episode when patient&#39;s sister could not wake patient up, patient had developed a fever of 101.9. Patient alternated Ibuprofen and Tylenol as treatment for fever. Patient was short of breath and it was twice as worse as it was. Patient also mentioned that eyelid on left eye went down. Patient could not seem to return to normal and had written notes so that could keep on track and that patient had become very forgetful and that patient&#39;s sister had moved in to help after patient received the vaccine since patient was weak. Patient stated that had severe muscle cramps in feet, toes, arms and that hands clench up like a fist for a minute due to the pain. The clenching relieved the pain but as patient unclenches the pain started again. Patient stated that was in pain and hurting, had focus fog. The HCP had told patient of side effects and that symptoms would last for about 24 hours but patient had been experiencing them for a few days. Patient was worried and fever kept coming and going. Patient took meclizine for dizziness, as since patient received the vaccine, the dizziness was much worse.  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from hypoxemia, and the outcome of muscle cramps in feet, toes and arms, cold chills, falling over, loss of consciousness, confused, dizzy, unable to focus, foggy thinking, fever, shortness of breath, pain, short-term memory loss, tired, weak, very forgetful and hard to talk was not reported.

I&#39;m in the process of trying to get diagnosis on it to find out correlation between the two to find out if it was due to the vaccine because my health started going downhill shortly after receiving my vaccination. I have been going to a couple of Cardiologists so far and am mentioning the correlation with the vaccination to see what they are saying and it is still an ongoing investigation. My heart rate increases drastically when I stand up and goes down rapidly when I sit down within 30 seconds.

On March 30 &amp; 31 I would have massive nausea.  On 4/2 after dinner I started to have chest pain.  This lasted into the night and I had cold sweats, nausea, vertigo and went to the ER.  CTScan w/contrast was done, chest Xray, EKG was adnormal.  Was admitted to the cardiac unit for observation.  Was there 24 hours.  On 4/4, I was still having the chest pain, went to another cardiologist where I had another EKG, Stress test, blood work. Everything looked good, couldn&#39;t figure out why I was having chest pain.  Echo was scheduled. The night of 4/6 the vertigo increased drastically where I couldn&#39;t close my eyes and go to sleep, went to the dr on 4/7 and that is when it was thought that it was tied to the vaccine.  Was put on meclazine for the vertigo as needed.  It was then that the anxiety and depression started.  By body broke out in Hives, was put on allergy medicine to help with those.  Unexplained bruising was occurring on my legs.  Was put on a Mediterranean diet which is supposed to help with inflammation. Stopped drinking caffeine and alcohol. The vertigo, anxiety and depression continues.  I had an MRI of my brain to see if there was anything showing. Bloodwork was done. Started to experience breast pain, went to my dr, had a mammogram and ultrasound to see if anything was there.  Lymph nodes are still swollen, have to go back in 6 weeks. Went to an ENT for the vertigo and he found some of the crystals in my ears, I&#39;ve never had that before. On 4/29 I had a hair appt where 1 minute after she put the hair dye on my hair, I experienced more vertigo.  Still experience the depression and anxiety, hoping that subsides very soon.

She stated she really didn&#39;t feel well and we prepared to move her to a lying down position.  Before lying down patient passed out.  She continued breathing with a pulse.  We called 911.  She remained out for approximately one minute, with stimulus not waking her.  While moving patient out of the chair to a lying down position she awoke on her own.  She had no previous medical conditions or routine medications, though did say she had passed out before.  EMTs arrived and questioned patient but did not do a physical assessment.  She did not want to go to the hospital.  Patient did remain in the pharmacy for 45 minutes after.  We checked HR and BP, both were within normal limits.  We drove patient home where here daughter was present.  Patient stated she was still nauseated when she got home but seemed better an hour later

                                                After one week of COVID vaccination, the patient started experiencing a sharp pain on the left side of her chest. The pain didn&#39;t go away but slowly spread to neck, back, head and lower side of her body. She didn&#39;t think of the vaccine as a potential cause of these symptoms, so started going to acupuncture and got blood and other lab tests. After taking Aspirin on 6/25/2021, she felt a little bit better. She gave  Pharmacy a call on 6/30/2021 for the first time to discuss this issue, and I recommended her to see a medical doctor to discuss symptoms and treatment.

I went to the doctor where my doctor tried looking for other things aside from the pulmonary embolism. A brain MRI was done which came back normal. A thyroid test was done which showed hypothyroidism. I went to a specialist after this where a thyroid ultrasound was done and showed a swollen thyroid.  I was diagnosed with Graves? disease. I have never had this before. I am now on methimazole 20mg/day. I had labs drawn to see if dose needs to be adjusted. I was told that it will be about 2 years before it can be determined if that medication is working. I also experience brain fog. I have lost 10 lbs in the past months due to this as well.

                                                Around 7 pm on 3/13, I developed brain fog, trouble walking, and then fever, severe muscle pain worse in legs, and chills.  Most of these symptoms seemed to improve on 3/14, but then on 3/15, I developed new onset of shortness of breath and chest discomfort.  On 3/16 around 1 pm the shortness of breath worsened and I went to the emergency room.  I felt that I couldn&#39;t take a deep breath in and I had chest discomfort on the left side of my chest worse when taking a deep breath.  My legs were hurting as well, especially my left leg.  I had sinus tachycardia (heart rate 106-120) and increased respiratory rate (rate of 20)  with O2 sats 100% on room air.   My breathing and heart rate improved somewhat with 1 liter oxygen therapy, 1 liter of IV fluids, albuterol inhaler, and decadron 6 mg orally.  It was thought that I had a delayed asthmatic/allergic reaction to the vaccine.  I do not have a history of asthma.  I was prescribed a Medrol dose pack and albuterol inhaler.  My hands and feet are very cold and tingling on 3/18.  Shortness of breath and chest pain seems to have improved but not completely gone as of the time of this submission on 3/18.

Around 3-4 hours later is when the real symptoms began. First, an extremely rapid heartbeat. My left arm began to feel numb. And I was seized by an episode of extraordinary fatigue. 6 hours after the shot, I was having muscle and joint pain to the point that I felt like I was being stabbed with knives - particularly in my tailbone, ankles, and shoulders. High fever followed, uncontrollable chills and shivering, intestinal pain, diarrhea, and intestinal cramps. The following day I had a headache and continuing extreme fatigue as well as pain in both arms.

                                                I started having an annaphylaxis reaction a short time after i left. At first it was intense all over body itching that felt like it was from the inside out. By the time i got home i was getting red blotchy patches over my face, neck, and chest. I took benedryl which did nothing to subside the reaction. When my chest started feeling tight i went to the emergency room. My lips were itching and puffy.

                                                Had chest pain on and off for 5 days (started Thursday 3/25),  which I thought was related to acid reflux. On Tuesday 3/30 when it became worse and was no longer managed with ibuprofen I went to patient 1st. I was given an ekg which was abnormal and then sent to ER. There it was determined that I had a blood clot and 100% blockage in my right coronary artery. That night I had surgery and they placed a stent.

Day after vaccine I felt mild flu symptoms all day and was struck with a severe chest pain and intense nausea in the afternoon. I went to the hospital emergency room and had multiple tests run. No cause was found for the chest pain. It began in the center of my chest and moved to the right side of my back.  I have been dizzy, nauseous and extremely fatigued as well as a headache for the last three weeks. The doctor didn&#39;t know what caused the pain. He checked me for a pulmonary embolism  because my clotting factors were slightly elevated.  They have not been rechecked,  though I requested my doctor have them and my platelets rechecked. I still do not feel well. My brain is foggy, my vision gets blurry at times, and I still have the dizziness,  fatigue and nausea. I am no longer achy and I have not had another chest pain like the one I had on the 26th.

                                                My arm was immediately sore and was sore for a week.  Within a few hours from the vaccine being administered I was tired, hands and feet very cold, chills, headache and a fever.   This lasted for 3 days.  I was and am still fatigued and it has been 2 weeks since my vaccine.  On Friday, April 9, 2021  (8 days after vaccine) I woke up with a sore throat and a swollen gland in my neck on the right side (side of my injection).  The sore throat and my swollen gland is starting to subside on Day 14.  Throughout these whole 14 days I have had hot and cold &#34;flashes&#34; and while I already have anxiety my anxiety has been much worse (feeling of a pounding heart) since the vaccine.  It is not my normal anxiety.  On Day 11, Tuesday April 13, 2021 I woke up with a black spot on the right side of my chin closer to my bottom lip.  It does not hurt, not raised and it is just a black spot.  It is still there on Day 14 and slowly starting to fade but not by much.

She contacted her doctor on 3/25 and he thought maybe she had an inner ear infection.  Symptoms continued to worsen and eventually an ambulance was called on 3/27 because patient stated she was having severe SOB and headache along with dizziness and fever.  Patient was transported to Hospital where they tested her for covid and pneumonia.  Both came back negative.  After several tests it was confirmed she had a blood clot in her lung and was also told she had clots in her leg and heart as well.  She was in the hospital for 3 days where she was given heparin and several medications for the headache.  Patient was discharged on lovenox and coumadin and eventually switched to xarelto by pcp who is managing her anticoagulation.  She still has follow up appointments with a cardiologist and neurologist.  She said she is still experiencing some dizziness and SOB but overall doing better

Continued strange feeling in chest and headache, hospital did CAT scans, EKG, bloodwork and could not find what caused all of the symptoms to occur but noted I had the vaccine just 2 weeks prior with a continued symptom leading up to the ?neurological event? and head that continues after as is still present.  Pain and numbness also continues in left arm.

                                                I will begin by noting that I am known for high pain tolerance and have been a strong, healthy, professional athlete for thirty years. The evening of the vaccination, I went to bed at 9pm feeling odd. By midnight, I became paralyzed with excruciating pain throughout my torso and arms with such an extreme fever that it felt as if my heart was going to stop. I had crushing chest pain which inhibiting my breathing ability in a way that could only be compared to being crushed under a burning truck. The paralyzation was so intense, with pre-existing pain multiplied by a thousand, that I couldn&#39;t even speak to alert my husband, who was right beside me. This continued for several hours until it subsided enough for me to pass out from exhaustion. The following day I battled residual aches throughout my torso and arms, accompanied by a mild fever. The trauma of fearing for my life that night and over the past week, exacerbated by the news of this vaccine I received being paused for issues related to my demographic, had made me too afraid to report my extreme side effects until now. With the encouragement and support of my family, I have worked up the courage to do so. It was the scariest, most intense pain and fever I have ever experienced in my life all at once and no one I have described this to has ever heard of the severity of what happened to me.

It woke me up from sleep. My blood pressure remained high and I felt pressure on my chest for three days. Five days after the shot the pressure on my chest felt worse and my blood pressure was still very high, I also have shortness of breath when I am moving around which started three days after the shot. I saw my doctor who ran some tests which were negative. I am still feeling the pressure on my chest and the shortness of breath after one week but it is a little better than it was and less often.

While I was getting her tylenol she fainted, hitting her head on the floor. When she came to, she started experiencing the chills along with an irregular body temperature. I put blankets on her, gave her water, and tended to her eye. I was able to move her from the floor to the bed within 15 minutes. She fell asleep around 2am. She has been doing better but has been experiencing off &amp; on headaches &amp; nausea. We did not go to the doctor since we do not have insurance.

I had leg  pain in both my sides.  The leg pain lasted three days. I took it easy for the next two days. I called the doctor and she advised me to go to the ER. I was given an EKG and Chest X-Ray and blood work. I still have the feeling of pressure on your chest after two and a half weeks. It is a similar feeling to when I had the Covid-19 in October of 2020. It is not any better or worse than when it started.

I was so severly sick, in bed and couldnt hardly move.  On Sat I was being transported  to the hospital when I got super nauseaed so my husband pulled over and I passed out and went unconscious and fell out the car onto the ground.  EMT was called and transported me to the hospital when a CT Scan and EKG was performed. I was given IV fluids, monitored and released after some time.  Over the next few days I felt absolutely awful.  On 4/15 I had a phone F/U visit with my PCP.  I still havent felt to myself to date and had to go back to the ER last night because I was so nauseaed and dizzy I couldnt stand or do anything and I am still having the diarreah also

                                                1 hour after the vaccine I was walking with my sister and began experiencing neurological adverse effects--I was dragging my right lag and slurring my speech. 3 hours after the vaccine my right arm and right leg began tingling, went numb, and became weak. These symptoms persisted and my doctor advised me to go to the ER for brain imaging 24 hours after the vaccine. On day 3 after the vaccine, my symptoms had diminished but not subsided and I began to have new symptoms: extreme heat and pressure starting at my right ear and spreading through my face and head. The heat has subsided but not the pressure, as I am writing this it is day 13. Tests came back normal, but weakness and pressure neurological symptoms persist.

It was a feeling of trying to see under water. My distance vision was not as effected.  It lasted a two hours and then it went away. I went to an Ophthalmologist, but it happened again two weeks later on, 4/02/2021 and my vision became blurred. This time it was blurred and almost like double vision. I was scheduled an MRI and my blood work.

Heavy clots of menstrual discharge were observed. It is not yet known whether these side effects will continue for my next menstrual cycle. Lesser effects followed two days after the vaccine with fatigue, sore arm, armpit, and glands in the injection arm. These side effects dissipated by day 3 status post vaccine administration.

I normally do not get headaches.  I have had a headache nearly every day since. I have taken tylenol and when sever a NSAID but I&#39;m not suppose to take NSAIDS due to having a lapband. I wake up with them and go to bed with a headache. a few days it seems like they have stopped but then they come back. I get fatigued easy the next day after the shot it was a struggle to do normal things i just wanted to lie down. I did not feel sick just exhausted. this comes and goes exercise really wipes me out just normal walking afterwards i will want to go to sleep . I feel like i have to keep apologizing when i cant help with things and say give me a minute.

                                                Within one minute of receiving the vaccine, I lost consciousness/ passed out. When I came to, it took me awhile to realize where I was and what had happened. I was alone in the room. I eventually realized that I was sweating profusely as of water have been poured all over me, something I have never experienced before. Then I began vomiting violently. I couldn&#39;t move because I kept almost passing out and I continued vomiting. The two vaccine workers kept wanting to call an ambulance for me but I didn&#39;t see what an ambulance could do for me and it was hard to respond to them. I could not get up or move myself or leave the store by myself. After about a half-hour I contacted my sons to come to the store and help me. When my son&#39;s arrived, approximately 15 minutes after all of my Adverse Events began, they helps me out to the car in the parking lot and I continued vomiting violently, even on the drive home. Once at home, I took anti nausea / anti vomiting meds and after an hour or two I could sit up and sip water. By that night, I had fevers and the continued throughout the night along with a migraine like headache. The next day continue taking the anti-nausea meds but I still was not able to move around or eat and I had fevers add headaches severe muscle aches and soreness throughout the day and the next night. For the next several days, I was no longer taking the anti nausea meds and I just constantly felt like I was going to pass out and vomit. It felt like all the blood had been drained from my face. It was hard for me to sit or stand or walk around. I tried to work remotely but even just sitting up in my home to a computer was very difficult. I felt dizzy and light-headed and nauseous constantly. On a Thursday, the 10th, I suddenly became very cold and chilled even though I had not had a fever that day. I laid down on my bed with a blanket to try to warm up but my teeth were violently chattering and my hands and feet were ice cold but profusely sweating like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced on my hands and feet. My arms and legs started shaking so badly it was more like Tremors bordering on convulsions. It was a very scary and I would have gone to the hospital but I could not safely drive. This lasted about an hour and after it went away, it never came back. I last had a fever on Sunday, the 13th. It was approximately 101. I have not had a fever for a headache after that day but I still felt light-headed and nauseous until June 18th. I have been feeling basically normal since the 18th. I am hopeful that I will not have any more effects but I&#39;m wondering how and where I should report any others?

My ears would start feeling full.....almost like they were swelling inside.   I went back to see my doctor and she said she thinks I have Vasculitis caused by inflammation, most likely from my vaccine since my symtoms all started within 2 weeks of my shot.  I don&#39;t tolerate steroids, so she put me on Duexis twice a day for inflammation.

The next day the chills were gone but I still had a headache which I had to take off work, it lasted a week. One week after the shot I experienced shortness of breath and my Reynaud?s symptoms were bad. My fingers and toes were blue. I had leg pain and I was concerned for a blood clot. I returned to the ER a week later because I had shortness of breath and chest pressure. I continued to have sharp chest pain for four weeks. I also saw a Pulmonary specialist six weeks after the vaccine and tests were normal. I am scheduled to see a Rheumatologist.

I do not have a CGM, I have to test manually.  Today is 3/23 and the first four days of the injection, my sugars were in the 400&#39;s.  The last three days they have been in the high 200&#39;s.  Yesterday my endocrinologist had me increase my long-acting insulin.  I have bloodwork Friday and I have an appointment with her 4/2.

She said she faints when she gets anxious (this was not disclosed before vaccine was given). She spoke with EMS who determined she did not need immediate care. She waited another roughly 30 minutes and was able to leave the pharmacy.

                                                Event took place at an off-site event, in a detention facility. Pt received Janssen COVID vaccine around 4:00 pm. Pt immediately reported nausea. Nurse accompanied pt to the restroom about 2 minutes after receiving vaccine, where she gagged into the sink and spit up a little clear fluid. Pt reported feeling hot and sat down in a chair available in the restroom. Pt and nurse joined by a second nurse. Shortly after sitting down pt complained of feeling dizzy and was moved to the floor to lay down. When laying down, pt appeared flushed under her chin and complained of chest tightness. She requested to sit up to help with breathing. Called 911 and first dose of epinephrine (0.5 mL of 1mg/1mL) administered, both at 4:10 pm. Pt reported no change in chest tightness following epi, but continued to respond to questions. She said she felt tired and wanted to go to sleep. Pt continued to report difficulty breathing, and another dose of epinephrine administered at 4:15 pm. A physician at GEO arrived and administered oxygen. He listened to pt&#39;s heart and lungs and reported that there was air movement in her lungs. Pt ceased to respond coherently to questions, slurring and moaning, but did not lose consciousness. Pt started tapping her lips and, upon questioning, said they felt numb. Third dose of epinephrine administered at 4:20 pm. Nurse continued to jostle patient and ask her questions, and patient continued to respond with short, slurred answers. EMS arrived at 4:23 pm and transported patient to the hospital.

                                                Visited ER as I thought I was having an allergic reaction. Treated with Pepcid, prescribed prednisone and streeted. Visited personal allergy physician 4/9/21. per MD Allergist/Immunologist DXd = systemic immunological vasculitis. Most probably a delayed hyper immune response to my vaccine. Legs, arms and sides covered in innumerable petechial eruptions beginning 6 days post vaccination and 3 days post vaccination side effects (chills, headache nausea) subsided. Eruptions spread consistently for 36 hours and are constant not intermittent. They are hot, painful to the touch, and do not blanch. I?m on 60mgs of prednisone for 5 days (the highest dose given outside a hospital) and then 40 for 5 days and then 20 for 4 days. If I get any mouth nose or eye or interior genital irritation I have to go to the hospital and be admitted for higher dose steroids and constant monitoring. Dr advised  this  will take weeks to resolve and the eruptions will likely fade slowly and possibly peel.

I walked down my hall and saw black dots and felt dizzy with nausea.  The next thing I knew I was on the bathroom floor and didn?t remember how I had gotten there.  It is Friday and I now am experiencing shooting pains in the side of my head.  I also have been experiencing pains in my calf muscles and some chest pains.  I am still extremely tired and having abdominal pain.  I have contacted my doctor?s office about the fainting but I am going to call Monday to get an appointment to get checked out.  I am concerned about possible blood clots.

This lasted about 4 days on the 2nd or 3rd day I had a swollen lymph node under my left armpit. It lasted just a couple of days. On 3/21/2021 I missed my period I did not get it the month of march. Now on the month of April I first started spotting on April 7th it was very light then it went heavy till this day 4/13/2021 I&#39;m still bleeding which is not normal because my period normally only lasts for 4 days. On 3/31/2021 I also had chest pain that lasted for 4 days then it started subsiding. On 3/12/2021 and on 04/11/2021 I got a weird abdominal pain that lasted for less than 5 minutes.

That mostly resolved after 2 days.  Then 1 week later on Saturday, I started having pain in my left leg where I had had RFA of the greater saphenous vein 6 months prior.  Leg swelled up got a hard knot.  I got dizzy &amp; nauseated.  The pain increased, &amp; I went to the ER on 3/21.  They diagnosed it as thrombophlebitis.  The pain &amp; inflammation  has continued  for 3 weeks now despite the use of anti-inflammatory meds &amp; support hose.  I have also had rapid weight gain of 12 lbs and edema not relieved by lasix.  Two weeks after the shot I also started having severe nose bleeds.

The strange thing was that I was having a hard time not passing out for at least 10 minutes after this shot.  I have never experienced this before.  I had no energy for the rest of the night.  By the next day I had a fever and felt like i had the flu for over 24 hours.  My husband did as well but he did not pass out.

About 15 hours post vaccine and an unrestful night, woke up around 5-6am and almost fainted or passed out.  I was very nauseaus, had a fast all over body drenching sweat, dizzy and numbing in fingers/toes (can&#39;t remember which but had tingling and was dizzy).  Rest of day was low fever, headache and tired.  Right arm was sore where couldn&#39;t lift it but that subsided after 2-3 days. Just wanted to report the fainting that almost occured the next early AM.

                                                Not too many adverse symptoms the day of and after vaccine... tired at times and sensitivity to light but continued to eat and helped w energy.   Also, warm left side of neck and slight red rash.  Not expecting to have leg pain in my calf 6 days later then moved to quad muscle and entire left leg felt achy.  CDC at this point said to check out any leg pain.  Pain was not severe but bothersome... had STAT ultra sound at ER on day 7, turned out negative for blood clots.  Returned to my physicians office day 8... still not feeling right with more of a rash on left side of neck and warm to the touch. Tired and slightly light headed and slight pain in left upper chest.  Digestion not the best starting day 5 thru 10.  Blood test returned normal for platelet levels but low eosinophils... either allergies or body is fighting the vaccine and creating antibodies (most likely).  No known allergies besides maybe skin reaction to Timothy Bluegrass.  Moderate headache day 9 and 10 which made me more fatigued (pain on both sides of head above ears and temples)... normally I do not get headaches.  Also, loss of appetite or feeling slight nauseous on day 8, 9, and 10 after the vaccine.   Now on day 11 and 12.. feeling better but still not quite right.  Lightheaded and feeling fullness in head but more energy than day 9 and 10 by far.  Never heard of people having symptoms after day 1 or 2 of the vaccine, so obviously I think this should be more documented for patients especially after blood clotting as a possibility 6 days after the vaccine.

Each time we attempted to have pt sit up, Pt would begin to have tingling in extremities and ringing in ears.  EMS called.  BP eventually raised to 127/66 with pt sitting upright but EMS preferred to transport pt to Hospital. Pt evaluated in ED and notes indicate that EKG was done and revealed normal sinus rhythm. Determined to be vasovagal reaction leading to syncope. Pt discharged to home in stable condition.

                                                I had the vaccine n Sunday, Tuesday morning I woke up with a very tight feeling across my chest/ rib cage area, particularly on my right side, underarm, under breast area. I also had some weakness in my left arm where the shot was given. The tightness in my chest was not affecting my ability to breath, I was able to go on my usual daily hour-long walk but it was concerning me enough for a call with a Dr. I had spent the day before (Monday) using a wood pellet BBQ so I though maybe the issue was related to smoke. The Dr prescribed a salbutamol inhaler which I have used before for seasonal allergies but that didn&#39;t really d anything to help with the tight feeling. The feeling of tightness remained all week (and still does to some extent 11 days later).  On the Friday I noticed a small dark spot, approx 2mm,  a bit like a blood blister on the back of my right thigh. I have had these before fairly infrequently, and I see a dermatologist once a year for a check up and they are not concerned, and they usually go away on their own. But, the combination of a new blood spot and the continued tight feeling across my chest had me concerned enough to call my regular Dr&#39;s office.  I was also feeling occasional sporadic aches in my legs in varying places. I spoke to a practice nurse who was very reassuring that she had spoken to many other patients that had also been experiencing chest tightness that had gone on for days after the Janssen vaccine, so after that I felt less concerned about the symptoms. I am still experiencing the tightness in my chest which has affected my shoulders and neck with what feels like muscle tension, and also been accompanied by some mild headaches at the sides of my head. I was pretty anxious about getting the vaccine which is not something I usually struggle with and on the Tuesday after the vaccine I felt particularly irrational and also very tired.

                                                I began to experience GI issues on an unknown date after receiving the vaccine.  I began to have indigestion, and acid reflux.  At times I was nauseous with vomit coming up into my mouth especially while sleeping.  As a result I began to take Pepcid Complete and/or tums and frequently slept sitting up.  This resolved itself on 3/30/21.  I saw my new primary care on 3/31/21 who then reported that I was experiencing high blood pressure even though I usually have good blood pressure.  I began to keep a log of my blood pressure which was consistently high.  About this time I began to experience localized pressure on my left chest which resulted my shallow breathing to try to minimize anything affecting the pressure.  I

I was sweating and vomiting.  My husband carried me to the car and brought me to the ER. At the Er I was given a patch for my back pain, medicine for the dizziness and nausea. The dizziness didn&#39;t subside. I couldn&#39;t walk. I told them I had gotten the vaccine two weeks before and they said it wasn&#39;t related. I was diagnosed with a bladder infection, high blood sugar, and vertigo. I was discharged in the evening but with no improvement.  I was not able to focus or walk for days. I saw my OBGYN, he was the only doctor I could see right away and he referred me to an ENT. The ENT can&#39;t see me until the end of June.  I wasn&#39;t able to drive for weeks. I am slowly regaining my balance but still feel waves of dizziness and my eyes can&#39;t focus well when I am reading. The back pain is gone. My OBGYN also doesn&#39;t feel the dizziness is related.

                                                3/13 vaccination. 3-4 hours later, I started having symptoms to include tickle in throat, post nasal drip. By 11:40 I had a HA, I was very tired, quite a bit of secretion. I continued taking Benadryl every 3 hours. At 2 :30 PM, heart palpitations and angina. My BP was 98/69. I took more Benadryl, drank some fluids. By 4:15, I was getting drowsy and tired, having pain in multiple joints through my body; 8/10 scale, especially in my hands in feet. I took something for pain. My arm was very sore. I had mild to moderate slight cough. By 7:40 PM I took my regular medication.  I was having a sudden intense HA and pain in joints was 9/10. I was having stiffness, chest congestion, feeling &#39;flu like&#39; symptoms, brain fog, and weird pains / electro shock pains on extremities. By 830, my symptoms increased to almost a really bad allergic reaction. I couldn&#39;t think well, dizzy, cough, chest congestion and my lungs started to hurt. By 10:30pm, I started to have a low grade fever, pain 9/10, I took Ibuprofen and Benadryl every 3 hours.  3/14 Ibuprofen, slight fever, slight HA, joints were swollen and stiff; 8/10 on pain and stiffness. I had muscle pain and brain fog, could not say words. Dull pain back of head. My kidney area, I felt like it hurt, severe anaphylactic reaction it felt like. I still had photophobia.

Monday I had low grade fever, continued medication. Symptoms continued for a few more days with palpitations, brain fog, pain in lungs and kidneys. I couldn&#39;t do anything. By the end of the week, I started to recover.  *My PCM knew before I got the vaccine they were on board and knew what was going to happen in regards to my reaction, EKG, I had epi pen, didn&#39;t pass out, I decided I was going to stay home.  *It took me a good couple weeks to recover to my baseline. But it was pretty tough.

But Then the sensation was getting more intense the night of May 26th so the morning of May 27th I went to the ER.

                                                I had a completely normal evening after receiving the vaccine. I woke up the next morning and didn&#39;t feel quite well. I started washing my hands and I woke to my husband calling an ambulance. I had passed out. I refused to go to the hospital per their request because of worries about COVID. I called my PCP and I discussed the situation with him and he told me to get rest and stay hydrated. I met him a couple days later for a virtual appointment. At this point the vaccine had been paused and I was very concerned about the potential of blood clots. I was still feeling fatigue after my episode, but I was feeling better. He told me to take a baby aspirin, once daily for a month, to help prevent any blood clots. After 5-6 weeks of receiving the vaccine, I started coughing, gagging and choking and had to get my daughter to get my husband. My husband gave me an alavert and I was able to breathe better around 10 minutes later. We think it was a severe reaction to possible pollen, or something in the air, but that has never happened before.

It happened again a couple of weeks later, and I went to the ER room. The doctors have not found out any correlating event that would make sense yet. I was told to follow up with a cardiologist, I haven&#39;t done this yet. I am not sure if this is from the shot or not.

Initial information received on 07-JUN-2021 was processed together with additional information received via 2 telephone calls to and from the patient&#39;s husband on 11-JUN-2021. The patient&#39;s height and weight were not reported. No past medical history or concurrent conditions were reported. The patient had no family history of any blood/clotting disorders and that she did not travel anywhere prior to receiving the vaccine. The patient received COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S (suspension for injection, route of administration not reported, batch number unknown), dose not reported, administered once in total on 13-MAY-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced feeling dizzy, and had no energy for anything. On 14-MAY-2021, the patient started feeling confused, her mouth started feeling like it was drawing, and her speech started slurring. On 28-MAY-2021 she went to bed and got up and she couldn&#39;t feel her left side, with paralysis. She was also drooling and her husband took her to the hospital. The patient was flown by helicopter to another hospital. During the telephone call to the reporter, he reported that his wife&#39;s laboratory results were all within normal ranges at the second hospital, including her platelet count at 189,000 (units and normal range not reported). On 29-MAY-2021, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of her brain revealed a 12 mm blood clot in the thalamus. The patient was treated with Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) and Plavix (clopidogrel bisulfate). It was reported that the clot could not be cleared before she was discharged after 4 days hospitalization on 31-MAY-2021.  As of 07-JUN-2021, the patient reported being highly agitated and could not hear out of her left ear, had no feeling or strength on her left side and was very unsteady walking. As of 11-JUN-2021, the patient&#39;s husband reported that the patient was still experiencing weakness of the left side of her body with no energy for anything (reported as being very active prior to vaccination), trouble walking, feeling dizzy sometimes, trouble hearing with her left ear, was very agitated and was frustrated that these events had happened to her. The patient was on medical leave from work at the time of reporting. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from the events.  This report was serious (life-threatening, disability or permanent damage, caused/prolonged hospitalization and other medically important condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This spontaneous report received from a patient and her husband concerned a 45-year-old woman who experienced blood clot in the thalamus 15 days after vaccine. No past medical history or concurrent conditions were reported. The patient had no family history of any blood/clotting disorders and that she did not travel anywhere prior to receiving the vaccine. On day 15, the patient went to bed and got up and she couldn&#39;t feel her left side, with paralysis. She was also drooling and her husband took her to the hospital. The patient was flown by helicopter to another hospital. During the telephone call to the reporter, he reported that his wife&#39;s laboratory results were all within normal ranges at the second hospital, including her platelet count at (189,000). On day 16, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of her brain revealed a 12 mm blood clot in the thalamus. The patient was treated with aspirin and clopidogrel. It was reported that the clot could not be cleared before she was discharged after 4 days. As of day 25, the patient reported being highly agitated and could not hear out of her left ear, had no feeling or strength on her left side and was very unsteady walking. As of day 29, the patient&#39;s husband reported that the patient was still experiencing weakness of the left side of her body with no energy for anything, trouble walking, feeling dizzy sometimes, trouble hearing with her left ear, was very agitated and was frustrated that these events had happened to her. The patient was on medical leave from work at the time of reporting. The occurrence of blood clot in the thalamus could represent background incidence of such events in the general population and the normal platelet count exclude thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. However, a relationship with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine cannot be ruled out and thus the relationship is considered indeterminate.

Previous to vaccine had heavy bleeding, but not this heavy and only one evening period period cycle of light cramping and mild body aches. I have become anemic since the vaccine.

                                                Received shot around 3:15pm. A few minutes later the area around the injection site got really hot and painful, and then I started getting really hot from the abdomen up to my chest neck and face. I called out for the nurse who came in to check on me and I almost fainted. I stayed at the facility for almost an hour until I was able to leave. I was not anxious or faint feeling before the shot so anxiety did not cause this. Once at home I was really tired. Today, July 13, I have had a fever, muscle aches, chills, headache, stomach issues, and a random numbness and tingling in my lower left leg that I?ve never had before.

                                                Around four hours later began with a head, heart beat really fast, small fever, extreme nausea and IBS-like symptoms (gas pains and diarrhea), fatigue. The later lasted for nearly a week, but the rest were gone by day 3. I did not see a dr as my fever never got very high and only occurred the first night. The nausea last maybe a day and a half. I am about two weeks out and I seem to be having a gluten skin reaction (dermatitis herpetiformis) and given most of the symptoms I listed could also be celiac symptoms, I was curious if there was gluten in the shot as it was very much like an extreme reaction to gluten that I normally get with celiac. I usually see gluten rashes a couple of weeks to a month after being exposed and I was not exposed to anything during the last few weeks that could be causing it (that I know of). The nurse who gave me the shot did not know if there was gluten in the shot. Hence, I know the first symptoms were definitely related to the shot, but not if the current rash is from the shot (because gluten, this is definitely DH and not an allergy rash). I hope this helps, if other celiacs have also had a hard time.

Fingertips still feel like electricity is running through them and fingers/hands still hurt; extremely hungry/thirsty from 03/25/2021 - 03/29/2021; fatigue, pain at base of skull under ears, tinnitus extremely loud and both ears feel like ear ache; During the night of my high fever, lower back where kidneys are started hurting very badly.  What is still left of that pain on day 5 is a pain radiating from my lower back down my right leg many times throughout the day (treating with ibuphrophen).   Pain around knees, elbows, ankles, and bottom of feet- different than joint pain.  All my POTS symptoms are in high gear (tachycardias, very low BP,  pain, dizzy, vertigo).    If the leg/lower back pain, and left arm problems continue, I will see my neurologist or immunologist.  I have reached out to both to make them aware.  My husband had the JJ shot same day, same place and had zero side affects.

                                                I was directed to my seat (if walking into the room, the first table but the 2nd seat).  The woman was learning the computer system from a gentleman, and she assured me she just didn&#39;t know the computer, but knew how to give a shot.  I pulled my arm out of my sweatshirt and pushed my short sleeve shirt up.  She did the alcohol wipe, then pinched my arm, I looked away as the shot went in.  I felt a horrible pain...not even sure how to describe it, just extreme pain and very achy and said Ow maybe 3 times (I am one that can tolerate quite a bit of pain, and I assumed it would sting, but this was different) as she was injecting me.  She apologized. The gentleman said Johnson and Johnson is a little thicker.  I said to him that I had never ever experienced this much pain with a vaccine before-never.  Again, I am talking about as it was injected. I went to sit down for the waiting area, the gentleman who was handing out cards for reviews asked me about it and I said it hurt so bad, I&#39;d never had a shot hurt that bad.  Another worker (female) overheard me and asked me if it was a burning-she had a burning with hers (think she said moderna). I said I would not necessarily say it was a burning, it was pain. As I sat there, I texted my husband and told him how bad it hurt (with the injection) and I&#39;ve never had a vaccine hurt like that.  I started to wonder if it was administered incorrectly? I looked over and the gentleman was now doing the vaccines and she was watching. My husband had Pfizer and he said that didn&#39;t hurt at all. I was feeling it up into my neck as I was sitting there. I was trying to rub my arm and neck hoping that would help as well as move my arm around. When we could leave, I asked the volunteer if she had heard of anyone else having that much pain DURING the shot.  She said she only heard of maybe one other person that said ow. I left, started to cry in the car because of the pain and experience, then spoke with my husband before I left. I came home and got some ice to put on my arm hoping that would help. I did expect pain in the arm after a shot. Within a couple of hours, I noticed pain going down my arm and into my wrist. I thought maybe I needed to be active with my arm and move it so tried that.  I started to notice more side effects of the vaccine as the evening progressed:  I had the typical side effects I figured I&#39;d have, achy, joint pain, chills, nauseous, no fever though. I was noticing pain into my neck (occasionally even into jaw), shoulder, scapula area of the back, and left side under the bottom part of my ribs.  I was feeling tightness in my chest, too, so I decided to try 2 aspirin to see if it helped with any symptoms. I did have slight dizziness, and a weird sensation in my head-like a zapping? I didn&#39;t sleep well, and had to stay completely off of my left side. Thursday, I felt better than that night, but still tired, achy, nauseous, chills, and not 100%.  My arm still was really affected...it seemed extremely fatigued as well as painful...the pain was radiating up and down and couldn&#39;t raise my arm without it hurting. Around noon I decided to take 2 aleve to see if that would help me at all. It did help with the pain and achiness, but was getting a &#34;nerve-type&#34; pain still up and down my left arm into neck/scapula area down to my wrist and hand/fingers. Still couldn&#39;t sleep on my left side. Friday, I was definitely doing better with all the other symptoms, I could abduct my arm more than 90 degrees, so I was excited about that. I did wake up with my middle/ring finger hurting (at the base of that area) and a bit numb so put my hand in and out of a fist. The pain subsided, but the numbness/tingling sensation was still there. I continued to take aleve hoping that maybe there was just inflammation around the nerve causing the issue.  Aleve did help, but it still never went away completely.  By late afternoon, I was getting concerned if I was permanently affected by this. As I was holding a bowl of food and eating, my left arm was going numb. I was even feeling it into my gluts (sciatica?). Again...all of this was after the shot and only on the side I received the shot. That evening I was able to lay on my left side, but not for long periods of time because it became uncomfortable and arm would go numb. Saturday, I still had the nerve pain and was not in a good spot.  It made me sad, angry, scared, and I didn&#39;t want to talk about it too much-just wanted my arm and all the different radiating pains I was having to be back to normal. I was feeling it up into my neck, scapula, my side(the rib area I previously mentioned), even into my gluts and down leg near ankle as well as down the arm into elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand, fingers (particularly that middle finger and thumb area).  I tried to use my arm as normally as possible thinking maybe I need to just keep it moving, but it would fatigue, especially between shoulder and neck. I tried Ibuprofen on this day.  Again, the pain relievers helped some, but didn&#39;t take it all away. Sunday I was in a horrible spot mentally and crying throughout the day because of the sensations I was feeling still: up and down the arm, shoulder, neck, scapula, side and still into ankle area. I decided I would call my doctor on Monday. Monday, I woke up and was feeling better overall, but still having the nerve sensations down my arm as well as up into shoulder, neck, scapula and my left side.  But everything was not as intense.  I spoke to my doctor who said there was a protocol, a number I needed to call.  Monday night I took ibuprofen because I started to have a horrible headache-didn&#39;t go away completely and still have this morning-not sure if it&#39;s related or just a normal headache. Still feeling tingling nerve sensations into forearm and fingers.  My shoulder/neck area feels fatigued, but so far not noticing the nerve pain yet, so that&#39;s a positive. On Monday,  it seemed to get worse as the day went on, so we will see. I definitely feel in hand/wrist/fingers as I am typing now. I know this is a lot, and I think I&#39;ve captured it.  Again, I had none of this pre-shot.  The pain during injection is what alarmed me most as I expected side effects after the shot, but not this nerve type issue.  For this to be lasting as long as it is concerns me, and the fact that it exhibits on my left side where I got the shot. I am very anxious as it hasn&#39;t gotten back to normal.

Rph applied constant pressure using cotton balls to the area for 5-7 minutes. Bleeding had stopped and a new bandaid was applied. Injection site adverse event was then resolved. Pt expected this due to her having a medical condition of anemia and taking subsequent B-12 injections. Pt was observed for 30 minutes and no bleeding re-occurred or was seen. Pt was directed to put ice and pressure on it for further home care.

                                                I received the vaccine on March 27, 2021. Seconds after the injection was completed my vision went blurry, but it only lasted a few seconds. On March 28, 2021 I felt like my body was going to explode. My blood in the back of my head was thumping. I tried to take a nap to calm my body down but my body felt comp!eye unrest and thumping. My urine made the whole inside of the toilet water look like a white thick cloud.  I have never seen my urine look like that in my life. I used my husbands blood pressure monitor and my blood pressure was 152/104!  I arrived at urgent care about 5:30 PM. They gave me a blood pressure pill. I have never had a blood pressure pill my entire life. They also took a urine sample since I told them about the my very strange looking urine. They found protein and blood in my urine. The culture days later showed no infection. I am still having issues with the high blood pressure.

Went to urgent care but it had stopped by then so they sent me home and told me if it happened again to go to ER.  I haven?t had a nosebleed in years so it was scary to get it the day after my vaccine.  The nose bleed lasted about 10 minutes and was very strong once the clot came through it slowed down and then stopped and did not return again.

                                                I received the vaccine at approximately 1:08 pm.  Once administered I was instructed to sit in the auditorium for 15 minutes for observation.  During that time I had a few heartrate increases and nausea but nothing out of the ordinary or concerning.  After the 15 minutes, I walked out to my car and thankfully my husband had driven because what happened next would have caused an accident.  Our drive home is approximately 20 minutes from where vaccine was administered.  In the car I began to feel a tingling all over my body that gradually began to feel like ?pins and needles? (like when you sit on your legs for too long and they ?fall asleep?), with the worst of the feeling being in both of my hands. I began opening and closing my fingers to try and get them to feel normal.  By the time we pulled into the driveway, my hand had locked up in a weird position and I was no longer able to communicate with them and make them move.  They were temporarily paralyzed.  My husband opened the door for me because I wasn?t capable of doing so.  Once I stepped out of the car, my body began to convulse and shake.  We stood there for a few minutes because one, I couldn?t make my body cooperate and two, we didn?t want our children seeing me that way.  My husband kept asking me if he should call an ambulance.  Of course, he should have but I think he was so scared and shocked that he just didn?t know how to react.  I had trouble forming words and sentences at that point and could not tell him to call. I felt pretty calm considering what was happening to me and I could not control myself.  My husband decided to walk away from me and coerce me to go to him.  I stood there for a few minutes trying to communicate with my legs.  Once I took my first step, my body stopped shaking and I started to regain feeling in my hands.  I went and laid down for a bit and began to feel a bit better.  Around 7pm I was feeling extremely cold.  So cold that I put on three layers of clothing and two comforters to try and warm myself.  That did not work though, as it was more of a cold from nerve endings than it was from temperature.  I went to bed around 9pm but didn?t fall asleep until around midnight.  I was feeling waves of cold down my body. Like a skin prickling when you hear a beautiful song and you get goosebumps and your hairs stand up.  I woke around 3am to an extreme headache and a fever of 102.6.  I took Tylenol and went back to bed.  When I woke in the morning, I felt better but had weird and random muscle twitching.  For the past few days I?ve been suffering with extreme fatigue which is not like me at all.  Even when I?m tired, I can still manage to function throughout the day.  Not only have I been tired, my body is weak, my muscles are weak and my joints hurt. I?m hoping this ends soon and doesn?t get any worse. It will be two weeks this Sunday.

                                                Within 2 hours of vaccine I started experiencing shortness of breath and my throat tightened up.  I tried to drive to the ER but stopped at urgent care since they were closest.  They found that along wit my breathing issues my BP was also running higher than normal.  I was given a steroid to get my breathing and BP under control.  I was released to go home, but told that if symptoms returned that I was to go to the ER immediately.  Given a 5-day prescription for Prednisone to keep future symptoms at bay.  The next few days my face and neck were very swelled, but I was able to breathe.  I was given the vaccination in my left arm, and my fingers have been swollen on my left hand.  The fingernails on my middle, ring, and pinky fingers are also very sore to the touch.

Called 911.  Blood pressure skyrocketed, as well.  Event continued for several minutes before heart rate and blood pressure  lowered but took quite some time to become normal.  I also experienced hot flashes for several days.

My husband would ask me questions and it took longer than normal to respond.  That brain fog seemed to have subsided late afternoon.  By 7pm the same day, I had chills, low grade fever and by 10pm the same day, I experienced extreme body aches, headache, and fast rate heart beat.  I took an Aleve and by 2am, I was able to sleep and my heart rate was down.  The next day, 4/12, I had a hoarse voice, body aches and a headache, no fever.  Heart rate was still pretty fast.

                                                About five minutes after receiving the vaccine I began to feel something was terribly wrong. I then blackout for several minutes. From my son&#39;s description I believe I might of had a seizure. He said my eyes were wide open, I was slumped over, and gurgling. I was completely unresponsive to him. He summoned the paramedics who loaded me in an ambulance soon after I came to. They checked my vitals. My heart rate was 47 bpm and blood pressure was 80/40. They also checked my blood sugar. It was 116. They decided I needed to go to the hospital and began giving me iv fluids in route. At the hospital an EKG was taken, which came out normal, they continued iv fluids, and did a urinalysis on me. All test indicated I was healthy. It about three hours before my blood pressure and heart rate stabilized. Just as long for me to feel like I would be ok. They discharged me at this point. Since they I have just been extra tired and have had muscle discomfort.

At night I woke up from deep sleep and started crying that my leg  was hurting badly and felt like something was stuck in my knee couldn?t  move for couple min.  5 min later I got up to take pain medicine and try to walk  and  I was able to walk after that so went to use bathroom ( to urinate) while I got up.   After that since I had pain in my leg earlier  I went to grab  pain medicine than again I started crying and saying I don?t feel good than I passed out completely and was unconscious.   My husband picked me up and brought me to bed and said I had black out and fell on my face  on floor .

                                                Received Janssen vaccine 4/6.  Started menstrual cycle 12 hours after vaccine even though had just completed last cycle 1 week prior.  Normally cycles are 28-30 days apart.  They have not been quite as regular since Covid and has had some shorter periods between normal cycles.  After the vaccine bleeding was heavier than normal with large clots but by end of last week had changed color and looked like it was ending.  Today had no discharge upon awakening but again has a small amount of bright blood.  Of course, there is concern for coagulopathy related to the vaccination.  No leg pain, no shortness of breath.  Has had HA off and on since had Covid but no worse now than in previous weeks.  Left ear pain has been painful since Covid but now has pain in both ears when that occurs.  Quit taking ibuprofen last week for discomfort and switched to Tylenol.

                                                I received the Janssen vaccine on 3/5/2021.  My first menstrual cycle after the vaccine, which started on 3/21/21, was significantly different than any other period.  I woke in the middle of the night to extreme pain in my abdomen and bled along the floor as I walked to the bathroom.  There were clots in the blood in addition to extraordinarily heavy blood flow.  The period was so significantly different from any other that I scheduled an appointment with a nurse practitioner that works with my primary care doctor.  I asked her to &#34;run&#34; all tests that were available and approved by insurance, which she did.  All came back normal.  Due to the significant difference in my period this month, the ARNP  requested an inner-uterine ultrasound which found the below:

                                                I?m writing this as a former, trained healthcare professional  (physical therapist).  30sec-after injection I raised my left (injected) arm and my deltoid/bicep had a sudden hard spasm. I told my husband (who was in the middle of getting his shot) and the administrator that  I was passing out.  I blacked out. They ran over. They said 5 minutes passed in which my eyes were wide open and dilated. I suddenly began profuse sweating  and convulsions/ severe full body shaking. They could not keep me lucid, and called 911.  Paramedics came and got a systolic BP of 36 (I?m unaware of the diastolic BP) with blood sugar at 111 ish. I could not form words and kept going in and out of consciousness. I was transported by ambulance to the ER. A few minutes into the ambulance ride I was able to form words, and vitals stared to return.  I?ve passed out a few times and this WAS NOT a normal episode of syncope.

I still have distorted hearing in my left ear and my right ear is still muffled. It happened a little under 3 weeks after the vaccine. The doctor performed a hearing test in my left ear and it showed moderate sensorineural hearing loss compared to the hearing test I had last August. 2 weeks later my right ear showed decreased hearing. I was put on 60 mg of steroids for 2 weeks and given doxycycline for 2 weeks. The dr also had me do a CT scan. I also had an elevated D-dimer test for clots.

                                                About 5 minutes after I received the shot, had a sudden burning sensation in the middle of my chest that radiated out. I thought that was it for me. Nausea, dizziness, numbness in my left cheek and arm, got a funny taste in my mouth. This got pretty intense and lasted about 10 minutes. They had me stay in observation for another 45 minutes as those symptoms came in waves but never as intense as the first time. They let me go and I went home to rest. On the way home my cheeks became flushed and it felt like my eyes and cheeks were swelling. I had a lot of other symptoms over the next several hours which I wrote down. Early Tuesday morning those symptoms went away and I was left with some flu like symptoms, dizziness and a brain fog like I have never had before.

My chin also swelled up really big and I had hard time breathing. I went to the ER due to my throat swelling up and my difficulty to breathe for three days straight and also felt a pressure sensation in my throat and chest.  At the ER they performed lab work, gave me a Toradol injection and also gave me steroids. I also took a homeopathic remedy which was given to me by a friend who is a doctor and my symptoms started to get better.   On another note, my sister also had the J&amp;J vaccine and she also had nausea symptoms but only lasted 3-4 days but I do not know if this is a genetic component.

Saw my cardiologist on 4/15/21 for severe palpitations and he ordered a halter monitor to be worn for 2 weeks. I stated  to him that I felt like I was in SVT, or something stronger than just palpitations. This continued for several hours a day from 4/11/21 to 4/24/21, when I was on the telemetry pack at work and went into an arrythmia that was later evaluated by my cardiologist as SVT and A FIB. On 4/25/21, I had mild &#34;palpitations&#34; but have not had any incidences since. I am now on metoprolol to control it and did not have a cardiac issue prior to receiving the vaccine.

                                                I had the expected chills, fever, headache, fatigue and body aches beginning about 7-8 hours after the injection. The headache, fever, chills, and aches subsided after about 36 hours. I had EXTREME fatigue for about 2 weeks, and had some increased heart rate and higher blood pressure as well.  Since the vaccine, i have had vertigo, brain fog, some light headedness and an inability to concentrate. It has affected my ability to drive and work when it is at its worst, and I have had some headaches when I am feeling particularly disoriented.  Sometimes I have trouble completing sentences and finding the right words. I have seen a cardiologist, PCP, and ObGYN and mentioned my sypmtoms to each of them.I had routine bloodwork done, and all was normal there.  It has not improved, and I have an appointment with a neurologist next week. I did not feel this way at all before the vaccine, and it is deeply concerning to me. I am worried about receiving any future vaccines and/or giving them to my children.  Please reach out with follow up information. I did not report it sooner, because I kept thinking it would end, but it has continued.  I am very frustrated and disturbed by this.  thank you.

Also on 03-28-2021, I woke up with extreme left leg pain. I had difficulty holding things with my arms and I almost collapsed to the floor due to my left leg pain and weakness. I also had heavy menstrual bleeding with giant clots for the Month of March 2021.  I can say today I have no symptoms of my left leg or headaches today.

                                                I woke up on 4th with pins and needles in my hands and I called the doctor&#39;s office. They said that I was crazy and nothing was going on with me and call back in a week even though the receptionist at the office had just said they were getting all kinds of calls about it.. For the next week, my hands and my feet were tingling intermittently. I went to the doctor on Friday, June 11th. They did a full metabolic panel - all came back fine. The next morning, June 12th, I felt my face was numb. I called doctor and she said it was anxiety. So my hands were pins and needles. The face numbness was new. I see a naturopath and I told her and she said it was call for concern and she looked at labs and told me to call doctor back and she mentioned that she had seen all kinds of people with these symptoms. My anxiety is super high. I&#39;m not usually an anxious person. I have high blood pressure. I have joint pain in my hands - if I take Naproxen. If I take Aleve the joint pain goes away. I feel like my face is dragging but when I call in the mirror it looks fine. That&#39;s the feeling of numbness says my naturopath - and that&#39;s the same with my lips. I feel like I have some brain fog and I&#39;ve been stumbling over words. That happens about once a day. I have a doctor&#39;s appt on Friday for blood pressure. I did not have blood pressure before this. Usually my blood pressure is 126/90 (when normal) and it&#39;s tracking at 143/103 and 140/100 ever since I had the vaccine.

                                                It probably is my thyroid, I have hypothyroidism, which is an autoimmune disorder, they are still trying to figure it out. My thyroid went really high. High thyroid can cause heart problems, fatigue, all that kind of things. They are trying to lower my medications. On 06/17/2021 I went to the doctor. They did blood work, CAT scan, heart normal, Covid test. I had to be hospitalized for 3 days and 2 nights at medical center because I had chest pain and shortness of breath and heart palpitations.  While at the hospital they gave me nitroglycerin for the chest pain and Zofran for the nausea.

                                                I discovered patient on the floor at approx. 3:03pm. She was lying face down on the floor next to the chair she was sitting on during her 15-minute observation post-covid19 vaccine. Unknown person turned patient over face-up, Face was clammy and warm/hot to the touch. Pulse was taken (weak). Sweating. Eyes were closed when EpiPen was injected on left thigh through pants. It was decided to inject patient as we did not know what exactly happened, why she was on the floor, and she was unconscious at the time we initially thought to give epi injection. 1 pen injected. Pharmacist called emergency services at 3:05pm. Patient eventually regained consciousness while waiting for the paramedics. She was able to talk and answer questions. She was taken outside the gym on stretcher, but her son met us at the school to pick her up. She declined going to the hospital for further treatment.

The staff noticed I was in some distress and kept asking if I was okay to which I replied I thought I&#39;d be fine once I got some fresh air.  Left the facility to drive home and didn&#39;t feel right, Within 30 minutes, developed chest pains, rash and labored breathing.  I recognize the symptoms as the same symptoms I get when I&#39;ve had morphine, which I now must list as an allergy.  This lasted 4 hours, then got better.  The next day around 1:00, I became ill again with flu-like symptoms and had to leave work.  Headache and body aches mostly.  I was ill with these symptoms for a 24 hour period.  Hopefully all symptoms have passed, except my arm which is red, swollen, itchy and feverish.

Within an hour of this onset I had a fever of 102.4 and was wearing 2 coats, had the heat blasting, and was in  many many blankets and still chilled. This went on for about 7 hours. Also during this time my heart rate was elevated to about 100 beats per minute (normal is 60-65 for me). and also the hear beat seemed &#39;loud&#39; like someone was dribbling a basketball in my head (maybe this is a sinus symptom??). After these symptoms subsided I had a splitting headache for several more hours.

About an hour and a half after vaccination I had shortness of breath and chest pain. (went to ER). Had nausea at ER was given medicine. Aprx 8pm had the feeling of something hot and cold being injected into my right wrist that went through my entire body. Called 911. Paramedic stated it was the vaccine running it course and to breath through it. Next day. Little groggy, low grade fever, slight headache and shortness of breath, Saturday morning had another episode of feeling like something was being injected into my wrist. It settled at my chest. Was very painful for about 3-5 minutes. Slept rest of day. Shortness of breath. Woke up Sunday and felt 100% fine.

I didn?t think it was a big deal, but it was unusual for me to faint.  I haven?t fainted since I moved in 1985 because of altitude.  I also had moderate body aches different from my fibromyalgia or RA symptoms.  This all happened about 25 hours after I received the Johnson Johnson vaccine.  I didn?t think to report it until I read the news.  I am fine now and don?t need any help.

                                                Around five hours after shot I felt what I would describe as brain fog and light headache, by the evening I was aching, chilling and had 101 fever. Aches in my muscles and joints as if I had Rocky mountain spotted fever again. That is what the side effects reminded me of. This went on for over 48 hours. I have never been so sick. Very nauseous by next day. Also fell to the floor from nearly passing out the following morning. Took a minute for the light headed To pass. Arm pain still today. It was very scary and seemed to be a very serious reaction. Friday after noon finally started feeling better. The other strange part of this is that my daughter and best friend and I received the shot together in the same lot number and every one of us was deathly ill with the same symptoms. I am the only one with the fainting spells. Still feel fatigued today. And shoulders and left arm injection site still sore and achy.

                                                Tachycardia.    I was injected on 4-3-21 at 2:15 pm in the left arm.  I was instructed to wait 30 minutes due to my given history of anaphylactic events.  I took one 25 mg Benadryl  and one 180 mg of Allegra one hour prior to the shot due to this history.  I was released at 2:45 pm and felt fine.  I went home and sat on the sofa to watch tv.  I sat there a couple of hours and thought I would take a nap since it was Saturday.  At 5:50 pm I felt my heart begin to race and could see the veins on the back of my hands pulsing and my jacket I still had on moving/jumping to my heart beat. I could hear and feel my heart beating too fast.  I got the pulse-ox meter that my husband has since he is an EMT and measured my resting heart rate to be 161 bpm.  It frightened me as the only other time my heart raced like that was during two other anaphylactic events.   I took 50 mg of Benadryl, got my epipens from my pocketbook and tried to breathe slowly and calmly.  After about 40 minutes my heart rate slowed to 125 bpm.  It took about two hours to reach a normal rate around 79 bpm.  I had it fluctuate all evening but not as high as 161 bpm.  I took more Benadryl as I went to bed.  The next morning my resting heart rate was between 90-115 bpm off and on through lunch time.

Symptoms improved over two-hour observation and was released. Continued 20 mg prednisone, pepcid (twice daily) and benedryl (every 6 hrs) daily for 4 days, followed by Allegra and Zyrtec once daily each until 4/13/21. Swollen throat, dry tongue, excess thirst, shakiness, weakness, ears full, headache, and increased heart rate/palpitations persist 7 days post-vaccination. Had in-person visit with primary care physician on 4/13/2021 who recommended Nasocort twice daily for two weeks for fluid behind ears and antihistamine once daily for 5 additional days, and will refer to local allergist for work-up.

Symptoms worsened as the day progressed.  I triggered a high heart rate alarm on my watch while sitting and dozing about 6:00 pm.   I ended up in bed at 6:30 that night and slept off and on with fever, chills, headache and throbbing arm pain until 7:00 am 4/9/2021.  I had to use my inhaler during the night to help breathe but do not remember the time.  The next day I was much better with the exception of tiredness, nausea and headache throughout most the day.  I have pretty much fully recovered on Saturday 4/10/2021 with only tiredness continuing to bother me as of the this report.  I am sleeping more than usual.        I did not notify the clinic of my reaction as they were closed over the weekend.

                                                Later that day of the vaccine I woke up about 11pm with a fever, all joints hurting, my eyes were hurting and flu like symptoms which continued throughout the night.  I was extremely thirsty which caused me to consume over 60 ounces of water overnight.  Woke up about 7am and went to prepare coffee and blacked out.  When I woke up I was on the floor and had a bursted nose and EMT was called.  I was transported to the ER where I was administered IV fluids, EKG and CBC were done but clear and I was diagnosed as severly dehydrated.  I was released about 5hrs later but the consistant feeling of constant thirst has remained even still today.  I have also had a lingering headache also.

                                                by 10-11 p.m. that night severe chills. did not sleep the entire night due to extreme headache, chills, fever (102&#43;), body aches.  felt truly awful.     by 6 am Saturday feeling nauseated and wound up vomiting. Saturday night/Sunday -- not 100%, no appetite, intermittent nausea, but able to work/do normal activities. Monday 4/5--nausea at an 8-9 in the morning and kept a trash can next to me during virtual hearings I had that day.   Intermittent nausea throughout the week and not much appetite but made sure I was eating/drinking despite that.   Wednesday night 4/7 -- I went to use a PT stick on my left leg b/c I had felt a little pain in my left knee and figured my quadriceps were fibrotic.  I could barely put any pressure on my left thigh. I had never experienced anything like this.  As soon as I started rolling the stick on my leg, my skin was immediately red and warm and my leg was so sore and tender I had to stop.   Saturday 4/10 -- woke up with severe headache and later that morning felt very weird in my head/heart, like heart racing and my head felt &#34;spinny.&#34;  Felt like I might pass out at one point so I had one of my kids sit on my bed with me until I felt a little better. Sunday 4/11 -- had another episode like Saturday (headache and lightheaded/spinny/pass out feeling/slow speech) and asked neighbor (an RN) to take my BP.  her at-home device said 147 over something and she suggested I go to urgent care just to double check.   About three hours later, I was seen at  urgent care.  BP was normal, heart rate normal, oxygen was 96.  4/13--followed up with primary doctor.  Send me for blood work to check platelets, etc.  Feeling pretty good today but nervous after the news and the pause.

                                                55 hrs after vaccination, I was doubled over with severe abdominal pain. Continuous waves of severe pain. Shortly after severe pain started, tremors/teeth chattering chills even under seven heavy blankets, lasted for hours. Headache (which had been there since 6 hrs after vaccination). Pain was so severe that I was getting ready to go to ER and then vomited. Felt a tad better only to vomit again three hours later, body in a pool of sweat but no fever. Aches, tingling hot prickly sensation running from toes to head, almost passed out. Diarreah every hour after second vomit, stomach pain started to subside then but never went away completely until 3 days after.

                                                Headache and general tiredness began 30-45 min after shot.  Muscle soreness (injection site, rib muscles, leg muscles, back muscles and neck muscles) began soon after.  By 6pm, muscles had become painful.  I had chills but no measurable fever.  I got in the bed but unable to sleep due to muscle pain and discomfort.  Hip joints and back began to ache.  Fever and chills worsened over the next several hours to measurable with highest at 102F.  I took 1000mg tylenol generic which did not lower fever but fever did not rise higher.  Throughout the night, I experienced calf muscle cramps and foot cramps, stomach pains, joint pains, inability to sleep, worsening injection site soreness and armpit soreness (likely lymph node soreness).  Once in middle of night I may have felt chest tightness but I even doubted that I really experienced it as I had been thinking about all the AEs I was experiencing.  Symptoms continued through night.  Next morning, developed a cough so I made appointment to get a COVID exposure test at 1pm on 13th April because I had flown in plane on 10th April.   Cough could have been due to allergy type post-nasal drip because of high pollen in area.  By late Tue evening, I felt better.  Headache had resolved and muscle symptoms improved.  Now (3:45pm on 15th April) I am still experiencing lymph node/armpit soreness and general inability to focus, think clearly.  I feel like I am in a fog.  I emailed a message to my physician and reported this through VAERS

After I come home, I can&#39;t breathe so my husband called 911. I was fainting.  I check everything. I have a problem, I can&#39;t breathe when I read or phone. Now I am better than old. I don&#39;t know what happened. I think it is the problem when I take the vaccine.

Been a 1.5years since her last asthma attack. Since a month ago is when she started to feel that she needs to catch her breath more often. Patient stated she saw her PCP on 4/19/21 and she was prescribed another inhaler (can&#39;t recall the name) and antibiotic.   CT scan was done when she was in the ER because pt had chest pain. No pulmonary embolism indicated on results but she states her scan came back with something on it but she wasnt able to explain what was on there. When she was in the ER the doctor didnt prescribe anything but when she went to see pcp her MD prescribed her an antibiotic (cant recall name, she picked up the rx but hasnt started taking it yet- wasnt home to obtain the name).   As of 4/26 her headache, leg cramps have subsided, she just feels very fatigued. She stated that every time she has a headache she takes tylenol. The last time she took tylenol was on Sunday 4/25/21.  Advised patient to start taking the antibiotic as prescribed by the pcp and to take the inhaler when she feels winded out. Also advised her that if she feels chest pain or extreme sob then to either contact her pcp again or urgent care  She has no follow up scheduled with her PCP.

                                                BLOOD CLOT IN ARM; FEELING SICK; This spontaneous report received from a patient via a company representative concerned a 47 year old female. The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported. The patient was not pregnant at the time of report The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: Unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total, administered on 05-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  On an unspecified date in APR-2021, the patient experienced burning sensation in arm, tenderness of arm, and pronounced veins on arm; also she was feeling sick. She saw the healthcare professional (HCP) after these symptoms. She was told about a blood clot (tenderness / burning sensation/ pronounced veins) in the arm. HCP recommended her taking aspirin and applying heat to the arm. Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included: acetylsalicylic acid. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from blood clot in arm, and the outcome of feeling sick was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments:  This 47-year-old female patient reported burning sensation and tenderness in arm, pronounced veins in arm, and feeling sick after an unspecified duration from receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  HCP was consulted and was &#34;told&#34; about a blood clot and prescribed aspirin with advice to apply her to the arm.  No other details reported.  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included aspirin allergy, and hypertension. On 31-MAR-2021, the patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: Unknown) dose was not reported, administered in left arm for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported. The company was unable to perform follow up for Batch/lot numbers. The concomitant medications included unspecified natural pills. On 05-APR-2021, the patient was hospitalized for venous thrombotic cavern sinus and thrombocytopenia 25,000, computerised tomogram head abnormal, fibrin d dimer increased, magnetic resonance imaging head abnormal, and developed platelet count decreased, venogram abnormal.  On 05-APR-2021, the subject experienced full blood count. The patient was hospitalized (date unspecified) for 12 days. The following laboratory data (dates unspecified) included: CT scan results not provided, Complete blood count results not reported, Fibrin D dimer was elevated (value not provided), MRI results were not reported and Venogram was abnormal. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of the cavernous sinus thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, computerised tomogram head abnormal, fibrin d dimer increased, magnetic resonance imaging head abnormal, platelet count decreased, venogram abnormal and full blood count was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Life Threatening).  This case version (1) was created on 30-APR-2021 for the purpose of quality improvement the following corrections were made. The MAC was added to the pharmacovigilance narrative.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V1: This spontaneous report received from a patient via VAERS (ID: 1238777) concerned a 47-year-old woman who experienced cavernous sinus thrombosis with thrombocytopenia 5 days after vaccine. Concurrent conditions included hypertension and concomitant medications included unspecified natural pills. Five days after vaccine, the patient was hospitalized for venous cavernous sinus thrombosis and thrombocytopenia (25,000) with an elevated D dimer (unspecified.) CT head and MRV were performed with results not provided. The patient was hospitalized for 12 days and treatment details were not provided. Based on evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS, per definition from Brighton Collaboration-BC), the low platelet count and temporal relationship to vaccination (BC Criteria level 1), the events are assessed to have a plausible relationship with vaccination. Reporter contact information was not provided which precludes meaningful additional information in this version.

                                                When I woke up, I was shaking really bad. I was freezing. I had the chills. It was 101. I kept going to the bathroom that night - 7 times. My hands went completely numb - both of them. I felt like I was going to throw up but didn&#39;t at that time. I couldn&#39;t breathe. My chest was heavy and hurting. I had tons of blankets on but couldn&#39;t get warm and was up all night sick. I felt like I couldn&#39;t walk - I had  no strength to do anything. I had to hold on to things to get to the bathroom. I did throw up the next couple of days and I couldn&#39;t eat the next couple of days. I tried to call my doctor - and they told me take Advil/Tylenol for pain. They told to me to keep drinking even though I was throwing. I was throwing up for four days. My arm was sore for a week at least. My hands are still numb. This hasn&#39;t gone away since I&#39;ve gotten the shot. My bladder - I&#39;m in more pain from it - it&#39;s worse pain than my normal - it exacerbated it. I think something from the shot did something to make my immune system not work. I had a migraine for a month - really bad headaches for a month after. I had to keep taking migraine medicine and lay down. It knocked me off my feet. I am still having the bladder issues and the numbness in my hands.  I had called the doctor a second time but they didn&#39;t know what to do and only advised ER which I didn&#39;t do.

I was sent to the ER, a CT was performed, blood work was taken, and I was sent home with a prescription for Xarelto blood thinner. I have to be on this for 3 months, and we will evaluate to make sure I&#39;m no longer at risk. My medical bills for the date of 5/3/21 were over $11,000, and my portion so far is over $3300 after insurance.

                                                After about 15 minutes I started to feel my scalp itching and tingling. The itching started to spread. Took Benadryl. Itching continued to be rather intense all night. In the morning I woke to hear my heart pounding and pulsing in my ears and head - what I am told are heart palpitations. The itching subsided after two days. Flu like symptoms started the next night after the shot and subsided after a day. Extreme fatigue began immediately and continues today. Heart palpitations continued for weeks. I sought out my doctors office after a week. During this time I also experienced alarming chest pains and pain while breathing. This confused gor about 3-4 weeks. My doctors office seemed to not know to report this or seek advice so I lingered while tests were being run. I normally had a low heart per my Watch and during this time my heart rate was double my normal resting rate. The chest pains, breathing pains and heart palpitations have improved, but the extreme fatigue continues to impact my ability to keep my normal routine and I?m having to reduce my work hours and take days off just to rest.

When I got out of bed I was lightheaded and passed out in the bathroom as I was getting Tylenol.  I took 2 Tylenol and had diarrhea about 10 mins later.  I went to get some gatorade and passed out again in the hallway on the way to the kitchen.  About an hour after taking Tylenol symptoms began to improve but became nauseous and couldn&#39;t get back to sleep.  As of 2pm Sunday current symptoms are extreme nausea and extreme exhaustion.

I slept well and woke up completely fine the next day.

                                                I was held for approx 30 minutes. Drove out and when driving home started to get short of breath, so turned towards the hospital rather than home and called them. My significant other also had his shot, so we switched spots driving at that time. I called the hospital on my way when I started to feel my throat start to close at exactly 1829 on my phone (6:29 pm.). Appointment was at 6pm for shot. Hospital was 13 minutes away. Half way there my tongue started to swell and my lips slightly with tingle. My breathing was more labored to keep up effort as I could not expand my lungs to capacity. I was always able to breath and speak, my voice did become more raspy.    Upon ER, Blood Pressure was very Hypertensive around 140s/120s with my respiratory effort to get in. Pulse was stable around 70-80. O2 was 97-99.  I was able to lay down and relax my breathing which relaxed my blood pressure to 140s/ 80s. I was given IV Benadryl, IV Dexadron, PO Pepcid with a liter of fluid. Monitor up until after 8pm when I was released with still mild tonge swelling but breathing ok. Continue Benadryl at home with my Epi pen for bees stings available.    Did go to work today 07/08/2021. Was wheezy, SOB, no throat swelling, tongue swelling at base. Kept up with Benadryl. Made it 1/2 day and went home. Walking and movement makes increase lung workload. My staff concerned with effort and flush skin while getting supplies. But flush and redness does subside some with rest. When talking need to take a break to breath. But can today notice when Benadryl kicks in. No history of Asthma ever or breathing issues ever. Very active on my farm and at work.

                                                Within one minute after the vaccine was administered I felt unable to breathe and was very light headed. I took 25 mg. of Bendryl which helped with the breathing. I felt very faint and experienced episodes of high blood pressure which lead to  uncontrollable shaking. I broke out in hives accross my arms and chest.  I laid with my feet elevated for one hour at which time symptoms subsided and I was able to leave the pharmacy. I had no further allergy type symptoms after leaving the site.

I went to bed around 7pm and was awoken by a rapid/ strong heart beat.  I went to the ER where I was evaluated, hydrated and then released.  The attributed the heart rate to the vaccine.  Sometime over the course of the overnight, my heart rate returned to normal.

I was standing in my kitchen and all of the sudden I became dizzy, my heart rate shot up, I became very nauseous and my  entire body became sweaty and hot and every muscle in my body hurt. My husband also received the J&amp;J shot at the same time and day and at 11:45 pm (15 min after I got sick) he was abruptly woken up out of a dead sleep to find himself running to the bathroom with severe nausea and vomiting. He was very pale and very very dizzy, his heart rate was elevated and this lasted for about 24 hours for him. We are about 10 days out from getting the vaccine and I still have muscle pain in my legs.  All other symptoms lasted about 24 hours.

At the hospital in the ER they had to stop my heart something called Cardiac Aversion I believe. My pulse was 190 and  with rapidly fluctuations they told me I have a heart condition called  STV they believe I was born with the condition but most of the time it stays dormant sometimes for your whole life. Mine became active that night and there is really no good reason why the only thing I had done different was getting that Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine

                                                I am not sure if my event was caused by the vaccine I received on  April 8, but I have a very strong feeling it is, as never in my life have I experienced anything like it.  My day began normally, and I just had returned home from an appointment.  I had some lunch, and a few minutes later as I was standing in my kitchen,  I began sweating terribly,  heart was racing, and I felt like I was going to pass out.  I  managed to make it to a large living room chair, and once I say down and put my head back, I passed out.   My daughter witnessed everything and said when I passed out, my arms were trembling and my eyes rolled back.  This lasted for about 30 seconds.  She was unable to arouse me for a bit, but when I came to my speech was slurred.   I did not know what had happened.  My daughter called 911.  By the time medics arrived, I was feeling much better and aware of everything happening.  The checked for signs of stroke, vital signs, blood sugar, and everything was normal.   I was transported to the ER, and my work up there was normal, including EKG and blood work.  The physician that I saw diagnosed me with  vasovagal syncope and did not feel the event was related to the vaccine.  I  completely recovered, and like I said  I?m not sure if it was related to the vaccine I received or not.  I just feel that it may be worth noting since I?ve never had an experience like this and  I?m pretty healthy with really no medical history.

If I had been home, I absolutely would have been laying down. My heart was also racing. I then felt cold all over. My experience lasted about 10 mins and probably 7 mins into it, I did start to feel better. The experience was quite scary. I thought I could have ended up in the hospital.

                                                Received shot in upper right arm and it was painful.  My arm grew more painful throughout the day.  I became very tired as the day went on.  Went to bed for the evening, Monday 4/26/2021 and woke up at 1:50am on Tuesday morning, 4/27/2021 in full body sweats, dripping with sweat.  So weak I couldn&#39;t get up or lift my head.  My husband took my temperature which was 103.  Massive headaches, full body aches and pains, chills which made my body shake uncontrollably.   My whole body hurt.  Could not get up to use the restroom, tried and fainted back into the bed.  Heart felt like it was beating out of my chest.  My husband wanted to call 911 but I didn&#39;t want to.  Felt like I had COVID again.

I am currently taking Eliquis and various additional testing has been done to see why this has occurred but are pending the results. I still have edema and the minor cramping in my leg and foot also.

                                                Two days after the injection, I started having leg cramps and dull pain in my lower legs.  On monday the 19th, I went to the acute care because I was having more leg pain. Dr ordered D dimer test that came back elevated. I was asked to go to the hospital for a doppler test of legs that showed no clots in legs.

I was an able to work because of the open blisters., I looked like Donald Duck.

                                                On 4/5, I started with upper stomach pain and then two days later I had a fever and a very rapid pulse. I went the walk-in clinic on 4/7 and they performed COVID (negative), an EKG and CT Scan of abdomen (both were normal). The fever went away, the stomach pain eased but I still had SOB, fatigue and rapid pulse. Three days later, the symptoms remained, so I saw a gastro doctor and he said it could be COVID or blood clots, then sent me to hospital on Monday, 4/12 and 4/13. They did 2 more EKGs, COVID tests and bloodwork. I still had SOB and pain in my upper stomach towards my chest. On 4/14, I woke up with a massive headache and saw the news about the vaccine, so I went back to the ER to get checked for blood clots. They did an EKG, CT Scan of the abdomen and head, along with more bloodwork. Everything was normal, but my bloodwork showed an elevation of something that indicated that I have an infection, but they weren&#39;t sure what. They sent me home with no diagnosis. Over the next two days, I rested and I gradually started to get my strength back. I went back to work that Friday for the first time since 4/7.

                                                Starting 5/14 evening, I started having tingling and pins and needles in my extremities, and that same evening, I started having shortness of breath/difficulty breathing.  I was wide awake and had a very difficult time sleeping.  I woke up numerous times hot and flushed and at 1am, I could barely breathe because my heart was beating extremely fast.  I was very scared.  I couldn&#39;t even slow my breath with meditation or breathing.  I somehow finally fell back asleep after about 2 hours, even though my heart continued to beat very fast.  I woke up the next morning naturally exhausted.  I have since experienced occasional tachycardia and frequent bouts of tingling and pins and needles particularly in my extremities.  Yesterday, 6/2, I woke up with extreme pins and needles in my extremities to the point of pain and discomfort, particularly my hands/fingers but throughout my body, and they kept up all day long and well into the night, worsening into the night.  I woke up today with less pins and needles, but there are still felt in my upper limbs, particularly my left arm/hands.

It spread to my esophageal tube (extremely tender), a couple hours later my throat became strep-like sore, could not take a full breath, and throat swelling impacted my ability to talk clearly.  About 12 hours later, I had facial swelling.  One full day later, a chain-like rash appeared on my arms, chest, thighs, and feet.  Each subsequent day is spread to a new body part (but never occurred on my face),  I had to take Benadryl EVERY 4-5 hours to keep everything at bay.  Three days into the event my neck and torso skin were extremely painful to touch.  Most days since, I am exhausted and get winded easily.  Today is 30MAR21 and it&#39;s happening again as it began on 21MAR21.  I took two Benadryl in the hopes I will not have to go to ER again.

                                                Patient claimed of heart palpitation 24 minutes after receiving the vaccine. When checking her blood pressure it was 170/105 with HR 129. 10 minutes later, it was 139/92 HR 110 respiratory rate 22. However, she said she feeling worse and requested for 911 to be call as she felt like the palpations were radiating from her heart to her throat. We eventually found out that she had a history of panic attacks but it did not feel like what she felt before. Paramedics took over and resolved the issue in the pharmacy. Customer left on her own without paramedics as her blood pressure eventually stabilized and decreased.

I was taken by ambulance and they monitored me and gave me Tylenol. I was discharged after four hours. The fever was down, and my blood pressure was normal. I had been having a headache and chill the evening of the vaccination.  I still had a headache for three days.

                                                Within 30-60 seconds of receiving the vaccine my heart started racing. No other symptoms. I alerted the nurse - she took my blood pressure and it was very high (XXX/110). EMTs were called in case I was having an allergic reaction, but I did not have any other symptoms of allergies, just a very high BP and heart rate. At this point I&#39;m sure anxiety drove my BP higher, on top of the reaction, since I was concerned I was going to go into anaphylaxis, but the original racing heart started within one minute of the injection while I was beginning my 15 minute wait time near the injection station. I worked on regulating my breathing and with the EMTs monitoring, my BP down to a manageable but still elevated rate after about 20 minutes. I did not go to the hospital. Once I was resting at home it took about 4 hours before I felt my heart rate was at a normal level and the feeling of racing was gone.  I did not have any other adverse reactions until 4/7/2021 which is the first day that the injection site (upper L arm) started aching.

Wednesday, Thursday and Friday - I had headaches and I had extra fatigue (I already do have fatigue because I have insomnia). My arm soreness was on the other arm not on the one that I had an injection. Friday and up until yesterday, I had nausea. Saturday, I had headache and being tired. Sunday, I had chest pain (woke up with it) like a burning in my chest. My left arm, I felt a tingling down my arm to my legs - it almost felt like a blood clot was there in my arm. I had to put heat on and then ice. I couldn&#39;t extend arm because it hurt. Midnight on Monday, the burning and the chest pain was too much and I was getting worried. The only thing I have is asthma, otherwise I&#39;m healthy. I went to ER - they gave a Cocktail of Lidocaine; Malex and something else to see if it would help with the burning in my chest.  Monday, I took Tylenol. Tuesday, the chest pains were more intense.  03:00 on Wednesday am - I went back to ER. They brought me to a full chest x-ray - front, side and back and a CAT SCAN and gave me another Cocktail and also put something in my IV. This time,  they sent me home with four different medicines. The meds are: Generic of Nexium; Aspirin low dose of 81 mg - bayers children - one a day; Generic version of Bentil Triacetin   - I take this when I want to be still; Generic version of Valium - they gave me four of these - and I have one left that I will take tonight so I can sleep. I am taking Vit D. I haven&#39;t taken Tylenol since getting on these. I try to stay hydrated.  I still have a really really funny feeling inside me. Last night, I was very restless and couldn&#39;t sleep. It makes me on borderline and dizzy and my heart starts palpitating. It&#39;s a scary feeling in my chest.

I reported the blurred vision to the Pharmacist and she said they have not heard reports forth this symptom.  Based upon events following the injection relative to my blood pressure; it is likely that my blood pressure became elevated following the injection, resulting in blurred vision.  My blurred vision   resolved several minutes later.  However, my heart rate increased later that evening to the point I slept upright in my recliner that evening.  During sleep, I awoke from my sleep gasping because my heart felt like it was beating too slowly.  It has not been several weeks since receiving the injection, and during this time period, my Blood Pressure (BP) has been fluctuating from &#34;very high&#34; to normal.  Yesterday, I presented to the ER due to High Blood Pressure (145/100), by the recommendation of a NP.   I have NEVER had any history of high BP prior to the injection.

Fever followed and reached 101.2. Intense headache next with nausea, Around 11pm I began wheezing. Just before this I noticed my heart had begun racing. I drank a lot of water during this time, drank soda to settle my stomach and ate 2 crackers. It seemed as though the crackers gave me heartburn. By 6am the following morning fever had come down to a temp (99.2). My headache was just mild and body aches seemed mild. and Some shooting pains remained. On 4/10 around 3pm I felt as though body aches and my headache were worsening. My pulse sped up and my temp began to rise. My temp had risen to 99.8 and my head was becoming much worse so at 5pm I took 3 extra strength Tylenol. This helped a lot.

Helped, but didn&#39;t make it go away.  Took the edge off.   Continued with Tylenol as often as I could the next day because headache was still strong.  Within 24 hours, I felt much better...mainly just tired.   Have had a slight headache off and on since then.  A little tightness in chest when breathing, but all mild.

She was given water, juice, and snacks. She felt dizzy and a bit nauseated at times. She admitted to not having eaten anything prior to the vaccine. At 1500, an hour after she received the vaccine she felt like her heart was racing and she reported that the whole right side of her body felt cold. People with her that knew her well stated that she &#34;was not herself&#34;. She also reported at this time that she felt like her heart was racing. This nurse recommended, by phone (patient had left the clinic site by this time) that the patient&#39;s mother take her in to urgent care or the ED, just to be sure everything was okay. Upon follow up, the patient did not go in but called the ED triage nurse. She was told this was likely a normal response to the vaccine. Patient went home to rest and her mother stayed with her overnight. Today client is back at work- tired and sore but nothing more reported.

                                                I have a history of untreated fibroids that were diagnosed in December 2019.  Because the coronavirus pandemic began in February 2020, elective surgeries were not allowed in my state.  My bleeding and blood clots were caused by the fibroids during menstruation.  On March 20, 2021, I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson 1-shot COVID vaccine.  By March 26th, the blood clots that were coming out of my body were enormous.  They had NEVER been that large.  Being concerned, I immediately saw my doctor as soon as my period ended.  Today, I learned the J&amp;J vaccine has been paused due to blood clots.   I believe that my blood clots became so large because I was given this particular vaccine.

My chest pain was sharp, stabbing pain that comes and goes, intermittently. I am on day 24 with chest pain. I was referred to the heart doctor, they did an EKG which was normal. MY PCP did a tri-triponent blood test was normal, an also ordered a D-dimmer and it was elevated, i was sent to ER to check for pulmonary embolism which was clear. Another EKG was done and it was normal. My electrolytes were normal. I had stress test this morning 04-14-2021. My PCP ordered platelets due to my left leg pain and heavy feeling and burning feeling that comes and goes. My platelets were normal. My WBC is very low and  I have an echocardiogram scheduled on Monday. The ER doctor said that the vaccine caused the inflammation on my body and my chest, having an auto-immune reaction.  I still have chest pain.

                                                About eight hours after I was vaccinated, I began to experience fatigue and full body ache. I went to bed around 6:30 pm, and I was violently trembling with chills for hours. The body aches became as bad as I have ever experienced, and, although I was lying still in bed,  my heart rate was alarmingly high for most of the night --around midnight my heart rate was 120 bpm. My usual resting heart rate is in the 60s. It continued to be very high, and it got as high as 130 bpm between 1 a.m. and 6 a.m. Meanwhile, I felt like I had a fever (although I couldn&#39;t find a thermometer). I drank a lot of water during the night hoping it would help my heart rate go down. I put a cold cloth on my forehead, and I took four Advil around 4 a.m.  My body aches and elevated heart (90-110 bpm) rate continued throughout the next day. My heart rate finally came down during the following night, and fatigue and body aches dissipated over the following day.

                                                Background: With Chrohn&#39;s and with the Erythromycin - I had some fatigue; stomach upset; and joint pain. I didn&#39;t go into it with no symptoms. These that I am reporting would be increased. I could feel injection go into the arm. By the morning of the 15th, I think, increase joint pain and fatigue from my baseline. My knees; feet hands - achy in the joints themselves. Fatigue: wishing I could have a nap throughout the day. These lasted for about a week. I had stomach upset that I believe may have been from the Erythromycin - but that didn&#39;t change that stomach upset - still had it... it may have gotten a little worse (the nausea. By morning of the 23rd, I took 2 mg Ondansetron for that nausea. That helped a lot with the nausea. Around 2 am on the 24th, I woke up from a very bad nightmare and I woke up with a pounding heartrate. My chest was really thumping. I got up to the bathroom. My heart kept pounding harder and faster and didn&#39;t come down. My watch said tit started going up to:  122 to 144  to 154 and it kept gradually going up. I was petting the dog and sitting in the recliner. I phone my Dr&#39;s on-call number and spoke to him on the phone. I called 9-1-1 by his advice. Paramedics came - Heartrate stayed up.  I was still able to walk around the house. I followed up to their truck and they checked me over. By that time as they were taking my vitals my heart rate started to calm down.  (It was elevated about 15 minutes about all together) My blood pressure - 160 over 110 when the paramedics checked me but that was coming down as they had me at the truck and the heart rate went down to 80-90 and was continuing to go down. It hasn&#39;t come back.  They listened to my heart. Never had that happen to me before like that. Didn&#39;t have to go to ER. I do have the apple records of my heart rate, etc. if needed. The joint pain and fatigue faded back to my baseline.

Light nose bleeds - mostly when blowing nose - chunks - persists. Also, have been menopausal but am now having a cycle - thin and light bleeding.

                                                About 3 hours after receiving the , vaccine on April 5 at 3:15 pm, I had uncontrollable shivers and chills, shaking violently through my whole entire body.  I was freezing cold to the bone.   I felt nauseous and threw up my entire dinner.  That didn&#39;t make the nausea go away - I continued to throw up that evening 5 or 6 more times.  The nausea continued the next day making me throw up 3 more times.  And yet the nausea persisted for a whole entire week.  I had a horrible headache that night that has stuck with me these last ten days.  My muscles ached and shot strange pangs through my body.  I was exhausted.  I could not stay awake.  I was so weak and tired.  I had no energy and just laid in bed for a solid four days. My throat hurt, my neck hurt, my head hurt, my arm where the shot went in hurt so bad.  Very strangely, my stomach was constantly bloated and hurt inside like a bad stomach ache - even if I hadn&#39;t eaten anything it still bloated and hurt.  The painful stomach lasted seven or eight days.  I had diarrhea for those seven /eight days.  I was completely dehydrated.  The diarrhea lasted way too long - it was difficult to return to work.  The second day after the shot I woke up to my left eye red, like some blood vessels had burst.  It took four or five days for my eye to go back to normal.   my heart has a stabbing feeling randomly all the time now and it is hard to breathe.  I wheeze and cough all the time.  It is very uncomfortable.  This heart issue has persisted the entire time since getting the vaccine.

Following the headache I experienced bruising on my thighs, tightness in my left arm, bruising oat the injection site for at least one month and a weighted feeling on my chest along with tightness and shortness of breath. Subsequently, I experienced blurred vision and loss of sight one month following injection. The loss of sight lasted close to 10 minutes.

                                                On March 21, 2021 at around 5:30 I had fever, headache, nausea, fatigue, dizziness. The next day, March 22, I had heart palpitations, dizziness and still fever.  On March 24, 2021 at approximately 8:00 pm, my right leg became heavy and felt numb. On March 25 I woke up to my mouth locked with Bell&#39;s Palsy like drooping on the right side of my face.  My mouth remained unable to open fully for the next day and the numbness and pain in my leg increased.  On March 26 I went to the ER because I was afraid I was having a stroke. They gave me tests and said I did not have a stroke. They gave me steroids and they helped with my jaw but the pain in my leg increased. The pain in leg continued with more pain in my knee. I followed up with my family doctor and they sent me to have an ultrasound of my leg to check for a blood clot on April 9th No blood clot was found. Pain continued and increased so the doctor sent me for an MRI on April 14. MRI showed moderate effusions to the knee joint and I have an appointment with a orthopedic doctor on Tuesday April 20th. I continue to have stabbing pain in my knee and swelling and discomfort.

                                                Immediate muscle tension in left arm  following vaccine shot in left arm.  The soreness persisted for several days. Painful to lift left arm higher than my shoulder.  The morning of day 3, I woke up to feel a pronounced skin irritation under my left armpit.  Later that day, I noticed a small welt on my left arm and the irritation had grown to include my upper left arm front and back. Over the next few days, the number of welts increased and the pain was increasing from the skin irritation. The tension in my shoulder started to give way to feeling tightness in my left chest.   I reported the symptoms. I tried to report to the Health Department, but they wouldn&#39;t take a report stating that the symptoms I was reporting did not match &#34;known symptoms&#34;.  On 4/13/21, I went to the Urgent Care to have the rash examined. The doctor tentatively diagnosed as Shingles. However, because of the chest pain, he referred to the Emergency Room for blood tests to rule out a possible Pulmonary Embolism.  The blood tests came back normal. I was prescribed 12 Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen for the pain and discharged.  On 4/15/21 I returned to Urgent Care because the welts were continuing to spread and the pain was increasing. Including sharp pains associated with the shingles. At this visit I was prescribed 21 tablets of Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen and 21 tablets of ValACYclovir.

At 6am I got up and was very dizzy. I had a bath to reduce the pain.  Dried off and blacked out. I awoke a few minutes later on the floor with a concussion which I am still not recovered from.  I do not know if there will be permanent damage.

                                                The adverse reactions of light headedness, throat irritation, heaviness in my chest and difficulty inhaling began about 20 min after my injection, It lasted 5 minutes. About 30 min afterwards the 2nd wave of reaction came on, with the same symptoms but was even harder to inhale and lasted twice as long. I took a combination of benadryl, motrin and pepcid which alleviated the worst of the symptoms after about an hour. To this day, I still cannot take a deep breath in.  About 72 hours after the vaccine I began to have diarrhea (and still have it 20 days later), lethargy, nausea and shortness of breath. The next day I had a little more energy, but still had continued shortness of breath. My vision had become less clear and my thought process a bit fuzzy. This is still happening today. Seven days after the vaccine,  I suddenly became extremely light headed just simply walking. To the extent that I needed to sit or lay down before I began to pass out. After the light headedness came on heavily, I also noticed a very heavy weight on my upper chest and found it quite difficult to inhale. These moments would come and go throughout the day. Regardless of whether I was just sitting and relaxing or walking around. These symptoms would last anywhere from a couple minutes to a couple of hours. I found it very hard to catch my breath and could feel my heart flushing often. Additionally I would wake in the middle of the night feeling that I needed to gasp for air. I sought medical assistance from a clinic, an ER and even my allergist and I am scheduled to see my family physician later this week.   I am not an anxious person, but have experienced many episodes in the last 20 days that have truly made me feel that I was going to die (no exaggeration!) due to the inability to breathe or that I may have been having a heart attack. I began to have chest pain that would travel from the center of my chest to my left shoulder. The pain also would move to my right lung area. During this I also had heaviness in my chest and felt I could not breathe in or out easily. I am still very light headed and have difficulty walking very far without taking a break because I feel I cannot catch my breath. I still have all of the same symptoms that I experienced 20 minutes after my vaccine. These symptoms have varied in intensity. I have often commented to my family that I feel the symptoms of the chest heaviness and heart flushing seem to come in waves. I am a health conscious person and have never had poor health in my life. The events in the last few weeks have definitely taught me how terrible life must be for those who chronically suffer from heart or lung issues. I am still currently battling these symptoms, however, the last few days seem the symptoms have often been less severe.

The fever and flu symptoms went away after 24 hours but the stabbing chest pain lasted for 37 days. The pain was in the center of my chest in different places and it felt like tightening and clenching. The D-Dimer  was elevated and other tests were normal. My Platelets were tested later and were normal. Doctors indicated it was an inflammatory immune response. I went to a Cardiologist for a Stress test which showed ST depression. The chest pain stopped after 37 days. I did have shortness of breath which came and went over the course of four weeks. I am normally in good shape and I run, dance and work out two to four times a week. I have been unable to work out since this began. I also had lightheadedness, chest pain and palpitations seemed to go together. I still have lower back pain and Tinnitus which started two and a half weeks after the shot. It has been five weeks.

                                                Shortly after getting the shot she reported feeling &#34;off&#34; as she was driving she started feeling short of breath and her heart was racing. When she got home around 5 PM she was still feeling short of breath and reported that her heart was racing. She was unable to speak clearly, but was stating that it was due to be being short of breath.  She also reported feeling lethargic and fell asleep until the next morning. She slept until approximately 12 pm the next day. When she woke up she reported feeling right sided cheek tingling. At that time she thought she had just slept wrong. When she attempted to walk down stairs she was limping and reported just feeling very weak on her left side. On Wednesday she slept in late again complaining of lethargy. When she awoke that Wednesday (3/10) her speech was markedly slurred. She was also saying things that didn&#39;t make sense. She was dragging her left leg when she tried to walk. We immediately took her to the ER and she was worked up for stroke. When she was triaged in the ER we mentioned that she had just had her COVID vaccine and voiced concerned that maybe she had a reaction to her COVID vaccine. She was admitted to hospital on 3/10 for a possible stroke.  Her MRI was done later on 3/11, Her MRI showed that she has strokes on both sides of her brain in the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes. The doctor referred to her stroke as being caused by a &#34;showering of clots&#34;. The doctor said this usually only happens to someone with cardiac issues. My mom has no cardiac history. Her doctor ordered an 2D Echo of her heart and no abnormalities were found (3/12).   She is still disabled from her stroke. She was hospitalized from 3/10 - 3/16. She was the discharged to other care facility from 3/16-3/26. She is currently needing outpatient rehab in a day neuro program. She attends this at outpatient facility. She has to walk with a cane due to persistent left leg weakness. Her speech has a slight slur, and she suffers from short term memory loss. She intermittently has trouble with her equilibrium and reports feeling dizzy. She sometimes has a hard time swallowing or says that it doesn&#39;t feel right when  she swallows. She also trouble with word retrieval. She has left-sided neglect which correlates  left eye visual deficits. She currently requires care from a general physician, neurologist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, neuro ophthalmologist and neuo psychologist. She was started on a new medication regime 325 mg aspirin daily, plavix for 21 days (now completed), metformin, amlodipine, coreg and losartan.

                                                The adverse reactions of light headedness, throat irritation, heaviness in my chest and difficulty inhaling began about 20 min after my injection, It lasted 5 minutes. About 30 min afterwards the 2nd wave of reaction came on, with the same symptoms but was even harder to inhale and lasted twice as long. I took a combination of benadryl, motrin and pepcid which alleviated the worst of the symptoms after about an hour. To this day, I still cannot take a deep breath in.  About 72 hours after the vaccine I began to have diarrhea (and still have it 20 days later), lethargy, nausea and shortness of breath. The next day I had a little more energy, but still had continued shortness of breath. My vision had become less clear and my thought process a bit fuzzy. This is still happening today. Seven days after the vaccine,  I suddenly became extremely light headed just simply walking. To the extent that I needed to sit or lay down before I began to pass out. After the light headedness came on heavily, I also noticed a very heavy weight on my upper chest and found it quite difficult to inhale. These moments would come and go throughout the day. Regardless of whether I was just sitting and relaxing or walking around. These symptoms would last anywhere from a couple minutes to a couple of hours. I found it very hard to catch my breath and could feel my heart flushing often. Additionally I would wake in the middle of the night feeling that I needed to gasp for air. I sought medical assistance from a clinic, an ER and even my allergist and I am scheduled to see my family physician later this week.   I am not an anxious person, but have experienced many episodes in the last 20 days that have truly made me feel that I was going to die (no exaggeration!) due to the inability to breathe or that I may have been having a heart attack. I began to have chest pain that would travel from the center of my chest to my left shoulder. The pain also would move to my right lung area. During this I also had heaviness in my chest and felt I could not breathe in or out easily. I am still very light headed and have difficulty walking very far without taking a break because I feel I cannot catch my breath. I still have all of the same symptoms that I experienced 20 minutes after my vaccine. These symptoms have varied in intensity. I have often commented to my family that I feel the symptoms of the chest heaviness and heart flushing seem to come in waves. I am a health conscious person and have never had poor health in my life. The events in the last few weeks have definitely taught me how terrible life must be for those who chronically suffer from heart or lung issues. I am still currently battling these symptoms, however, the last few days seem the symptoms have often been less severe.

                                                Pt was given Janssen shot at 9:40am. Within 3-4 minutes, pt complained that she felt tingly, lightheaded, faint, and had issues breathing. She was instructed to sit in a chair along with her husband by her side. In the meantime, RPH called for help in the store. Store PIC came over and called 911. After the PIC was on the phone with 911 for 2-3 minutes, the pt complained of trouble breathing and faintness. She was then administered an epi-pen. She started to feel a little better, less faint and could breathe a little easier (maybe 10% improvement) but not great. After 5 minutes, the paramedics had not shown up yet so she was given another dose of epipen because she started to have more faintness, lightheadedness, sweatyness, tingly and SOB. 3-5 minutes after 2nd dose of epi was given, paramedics then arrived to the scene. They took her BP and it was ~ 76/40. They took her away in the aid car.

Stopped the Aspirin.  Then learned of the link of J&amp;J Vaccines to blood clots.  Called my primary physician (5/6/21) who suggested testing to r/o DVT.   (5/7) Venous ultrasound confirmed a DVT/ blood clot in (R) lower leg.  Was then sent directly to ER for further exam and initiation of anti-coagulation therapy.  Started on Eliquis starter pack:  Initially 10mg BID,  then 5mg BID.

I woke up at 3am Friday morning with body aches and still had the headache. I took more Tylenol. By 9am Friday morning I had severe adverse reactions. I still had a severe headache and body aches with muscle soreness and extreme fatigue. I also experienced chills, light sensitivity and brain fog. Around 4:30 pm I developed chest pains that lasted about one hour. My headache, body aches and fatigue have not subsided as of today. I have had a televisit with my physicians office on may 10 where bloodwork. Some of my headaches rk was requested. The results showed elevated kidney function due to the amount of Advil I had taken to control the headache and muscle soreness. The recommended Tylenol did not alleviate my headache or muscle soreness so I have not taken either medicine.  Some of my headaches have been accompanied with nausea and light sensitivity. I went for a physical exam on 5/18/21 and more bloodwork was requested. It has been 6 weeks and these adverse effects have not subsided.

By 5pm, I couldn&#39;t even focus, my legs were so swollen, my &#39;head was ready to explode&#39; and I  &#39;didn&#39;t feel right. I went to urgent care; 160/98 BP and referred to the ER. I went to the ER, BP was still elevated, legs still swollen. Checked my heart, ultra sound on my legs and x-ray. I was kind of &#39;out of it&#39;. They did everything to check for blood clots and heart; everything came back clear. They gave me some medicine for my head thru IV. I still left with HA but didn&#39;t feel as bad. That helped my BP went down. I was at the ER 2-3 hours, drinking lots of water. The next day the swelling started to go down on the legs and migraine was subsided. By Sat., I felt fine.

I did not feel well at all for about a week after my vaccine, everyday around 4pm I would get really bad headaches for about 3-4 weeks. I was nauseated and sweating.

Called my PCP they advised me to just watch my blood pressure, progressively it got lower and went away.

On 5/24/21, she did not report feeling sick or having a headache and threw up around 11 am.  Throwing up was the only way I knew to ask her how she was feeling.  She said, I think I threw up because my head hurt.  I asked her where it hurt and she said, in the back.  I took her to the ED and she had a brain bleed and 5 blood clots in the major veins and sinuses of the left hemisphere of her brain.  Her medical team said this is a very rare part of the brain to have blood clots.  I would like further investigation into whether this was related to the vaccine.

                                                The next day after my left arm got really swole and it begin to tingle.  I reached out to my PCP who advised I see a Specialist and gave an Anti-inflammatory but it did nothing.  A couple week later around 2:30am I woke up out of my sleep with severe shakes in my chest area, my arms and hands go so clammy and I felt so anxious I couldnt sit still and was pasing back and forward.  I had the sense of feeling choked.  The shakes were so bad causing me to get up and walk around.  At 4am I went for a walk in the neighborhood because I still could not stop shaking and remain still.  I was so adjitated around 6am I got up and began to drive to the beach then all of the sudden after about 20 minutes I had to pull over because my arms from elbow down went numb and I couldn&#39;t drive.  I was still so jittery and shaky but was able to make it to the ER where I was monitor for about 5 hrs. CBC and Urinalysis were done but everything seemed normal.  For about 10 days I had that shaky feeling, tightness in my chest area and just felt really crappy.  My PCP perscribed a few different Anti-anxiety meds but I had  an allergic reaction to those so I could not take any of those either. I have an appointment with the Neurologist  7/26.

                                                Patient received a COVID vaccine immediately after which she stated she passes out sometimes with shot. Immediately thereafter she became pale, her head fell backwards in the chair , eyes rolled back, her hands curled under, her body became ridged and she started shaking. She was unresponsive and was laid on the ground. in the process of turning her on her side she became conscious again but did not know where she was or why she was on the floor. She was sweating  and was still quite pale. She said she felt sick while she was laying on the floor at which point she sat up and we moved her to a chair. Upon sitting in the chair she was still feeling sick and was pale and sweating. she began to throw up a few times and I took her blood pressure after. 116/70 Pulse was 60. She did not want an ambulance. After about 10 minutes of sitting her color was back to normal she was no longer sweating and was alert and conversing normally. Pt was advised to head to urgent care or contact her doctor if she experienced any further symptoms as she may have experienced a seizure. She has no prior history of seizure and has only ever passed out from previous shots.

Stayed in bed, the first day and all day the second day, by the third day finally got up and went to work, still tired, weak etc. but thought it would go away, it was just a side effect from the injection which I was told would happen.  At work walked about 200 yards and literally couldn&#39;t breathe, heart beating very fast and at that point knew something was terribly wrong and went to the doctors.

Patient regained consciousness while I was on the phone with 911.  Patient immediately said that she was OK.  She said she felt like she was going to black out so decided to lay on the ground to prevent any injury.  She mentioned at that time that she had a history of blacking out.  Patient was assessed for breathing, color changes, injury as per 911 instructions while awaiting paramedics.  Paramedics assessed patient and concluded that patient had normal vital signs and no other issues of concern and was allowed to go home.  Patient did not receive any treatment

                                                About 5 or 6 hours after the shot , I developed body aches and chills and had a fever of 101. This lasted through the night, along with a sharp pain in my chest that developed in the night and radiated from front to back, which made it difficult to sleep. During the night, I took some rolaids and moved the couch to sleep more upright, because I think the pain may have been heartburn or some other GI thing (I rarely get this feeling, but I have had it before, and my last meal of the day was several hours before i went to bed and before my symptoms started). By morning the next day (Sunday), my whole left arm was achy, down to my hand and fingers, and my right arm also but not as severe. My left armpit felt tender (and still does today, but not as bad).  By mid-day, I started to feel better, the fever was gone, and by late afternoon, the body aches were gone. My left arm and hand was still tender, but not as bad. By Sunday night i would say I was back to about 80%, and by Monday morning, 95%, and by late Monday morning, back to normal, other than the slight tenderness I still feel (today being Tuesday) in my left armpit.

                                                A few minutes after I received the shot I experienced an extreme intense feeling of warmth rush through my body.   My heart rate increased,  I had a sudden headache towards the back of my head and I became lightheaded.   The pharmacist gave me water and within 3-5 minutes, the reaction subsided and I felt better.  I felt fine the rest of the day after this brief reaction.

                                                I had the shot on weds afternoon. On Thursday I felt ill with flu-like symptoms, mainly body aches and headache. These symptoms were gone by Friday and I felt great. I woke up Saturday morning at 4:30am and needed to use the bathroom/, which is about 10 steps from my bed. As I entered the bathroom I completely blacked out, causing me to fall and break my ribs. This has never happened to me, and there was nothing else wrong with me (I spent 2 days in the hospital checking heart, brain, inner ear, etc). In addition to the 4:30am blackout, it also happened again several hours later at 11am, saturday morning. This time I again got so dizzy I couldn&#39;t stay on my feet, and while my husband was right there lowering me to the floor I was in a daze, a cold sweat, and absolutely no control over it.

She is uncertain how long she was out for, but notes it felt like a long time. Then someone came and helped her up from the toilet and took her back to the couch. She&#39;s been feeling still a little lightheaded with &#34;heavy muscles&#34; and headaches.

                                                At 12 hours through 16 hours after administration of the vaccine I experienced rigorous shivers, feeling freezing cold to the bone for hours and couldn&#39;t get warm (even with piles of blankets), periodic heart pain and some chest pressure, periodic knife like stabbing pain in my right knee, mild nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, severe weakness, sometimes a cough.  At 16 hours I got up to get water and had to hold onto things to keep my balance. After drinking a couple of cups of water, I turned away from the bathroom sink and lost consciousness, fainting and falling onto my bathroom floor. The jolt of the fall woke me up and it took a lot of strength to get up. The symptoms were vicious. When I fainted, the brunt of my weight must of been on my upper left rib cage. My ribs were so sore for a week. It was difficult to walk, breath, blow my nose, or cough.  My health provider recommended a Tylenol regime for pain control so that I could take deep breaths and prevent pneumonia. I had a low grade fever of 99 degrees F for one to two days following the vaccine. During the week that followed I felt periodically very ill, had a constant headache for a day or two, and had extremely foggy thinking and sometimes confusion.  I was very fatigued all week long. I lost my appetite and have still not gained my typical appetite back. Day 8 to 9 is when I was finally feeling closer to normal. Today I feel I may be back to 100%, but my rib cage is still healing, either from a contusion, fracture, or break (likely a contusion).

                                                An immediate burning sensation at the vaccination site as the vaccine was being injected. The burning sensation spread from the injection site upward to my  neck all the way to my right ear. The burning sensation then started from my injection site down to my elbow. The burning sensation stopped after a few minutes, then I felt silently nauseous and lightheaded.   After waiting 15 minutes I felt fine enough to go home. However, the pain and stiffness in my neck was ongoing throughout the following day and night and was only slightly relieved with 500mg doses of Tylenol every 4-5 hours.  On a couple of occasions the day of and the day following the vaccination I did feel fleeting chest pain, but not enough pain or intensity to warrant a trip to the doctor. This morning (4-11/21) the aching sensation in my neck and arm (primarily neck) have lessened, but still present.

                                                10 days after the vaccine I developed dizziness, tachycardia, dry mouth,chest pressure, shortness of breath and felt like I was going to pass out, and I had a feeling of extreme doom. I was transported to a clinic. There I had a heart rate of 140 with irregular beats. Continued feeling of doom. An EKG showed ST depression. Symptoms improved with nitroglycerin. The clinic didn&#39;t have the technology to provide care so I was emergently transported again. At that hospital my D-dimer was positive and that lead to a CT Angiogram. This showed a pulmonary embolism. Doppler studies of both legs were negative. I was placed on Heparin for several hours and then switched to Eliquis. About 6 hours after being on Eliquis I had the exact same original symptoms and again nitro was given which helped the symptoms. I was placed back on Heparin for a longer period of time. Once I was anticoagulated I was then switch to Eliquis 10mg BID for 7 days then 5mg BID for 6-9 months. I had a CT Angiogram of the head and neck which was normal. At this time I still have dizziness with standing and intermittently with sitting, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath.

                                                Vasovagal syncope.  Had vaccine on the 17th on the 25th in the early morning hours I got out of my bed, passed out or had a seizure in my kitchen.  Went to doctor 4 days later because I was in pain mainly in feet, was told I broke my foot.  I asked if vaccine could have caused it and was blown off by 3 different healthcare providers, I thought by law they were supposed t report adverse effects like this.

They got me in on March 25 (Thursday). Dr inspected and told me it&#39;s thrombus that caused huge pain. They did the surgery right away, removed thrombus. I never had blood clots problem and I was healthy, which my blood test result can prove. Thrombus generated 12 days after my J&amp;J vaccine shot, I am reporting this side effect. You may find all my medical record from Doctor&#39;s office.

                                                The night after the night of my vaccine I had a tightening of my whole left side, from my eye, down my neck, into my shoulder and chest and down left arm.  Then I started to get shooting pain all around my shoulder blades.  I brushed it off thinking that most people had complaints of feeling pain or sick the few days after their vaccines and then they said it went away.  Mine never went away.  After about 5 days it really started to worry me.  The pain was very intense- unbearable even- and i couldnt move my left arm or lie back in any way without incredible pain.  I called urgent care and they told me I could come in if the pain was bad but that maybe I wanted to see my regular physician to see what was going on.  I made an appointment with my doctor but it wasn?t until the end of the next week.  After 8 days, I couldn?t take it anymore.  I went to urgent care- they did an EKG and a chest xray and said all was normal.  They gave me an anti-inflammatory (naproxen) and a muscle relaxer. They took blood and the only thing they noted to me was that I should have my doctor check my platelette count.  They told me they thought it must be muscular.  I went home.  Neither of those medications seemed to help.  The pain was less in the day when I was moving around, but towards the end of the day it was getting so bad (still is) that I can?t sleep or get comfortable.  My doctor did blood work and couldn?t seem to find the source of what was going on with me either.  She prescribed me a new anti-inflammatory (meloxicam), a new muscle relaxer (cyclobenzaprine) and a pain killer (hydrocodone acetamin).  Sometimes those medications help- they knock me out- but when I wake up I feel the same.  I can?t take them in the day because they make me too loopy and tired.  I don?t know what is wrong. I can?t seem to get answers and  nobody can figure it out.  It is definitely my left side. I feel it in ky head, my chest, my shoulder and down my left arm and it has been almost 5 weeks.  It seems to be getting worse not better.  Looking for help or direction please

On April 13, 2021 I contacted my PCP nurse triage; at which time I was instructed to dial 911 or go to the ER due to listed symptoms; thereafter my husband transported me to ER. I was examined by an ER physician who ordered an ultrasound of both legs; results were no concerns. I was instructed to take OTC Advil/Tylenol for pain along with an OTC acid reducer for chest pain and to follow up with my PCP as needed.

                                                felt fine after the shot at 4:45pm.  the next morning around 10:30am I began experiencing black-out episodes when I would move my head to look over my shoulder, look to either side of the room.  When I got up from sitting to walk to the bathroom, my legs were wobbly as if I was going to fall.  I also developed a severe headache that lasted 3 days.  The black-outs ended after 12 hours.  Then Tuesday-Friday I had the &#34;expected&#34; feel like the flu hit me.

By 11:00 PM pt. felt faint and nauseated and left leg was swollen and discolored. Rescue squad was called and took pt. to Hosp where she was told it was sciaticia. After showing the medical professionals her leg and insisting upon an ultrasound of her leg she was told the &#34;machine&#34; was not available and she would be called the next day to be scheduled. Per pt&#39;s daughter, she was never called and daughter called hospital to have U/S scheduled. Pt. went back to hospital on 4/14 at 3:15 PM for U/S and she was diagnosed with multi DVT&#39;s in left leg which at that time had swelling all the way down to her foot. Pt. was put on Coumadin.

                                                A couple of days after vaccine, I experienced more blood in my nose that was fresh and kind of clump-like as the day progressed. But I called the Dr and the doctor doesn&#39;t think it is sinus related. I switched nasal sprays - got off the Zyrtec and Flonase - and I got on Nasacort and I was better with the nasal issue when I did that. Then in the past, I have had discomfort on the left side of my ribs - on and  off - but the last week to week and a half it has been pretty consistent. For the rib issue, I&#39;m taking a med for that  - Naproxen. That med may have helped a little but I do still feel like I have something that is not right on that side of my body. It did not alleviate it completely.  April 7, I have had a bad leg cramp when I woke up and each morning since it felt like I was going to cramp up and they felt painful when I was sitting for a long period of time or when I was laying down getting ready to fall asleep. For the leg cramps, I am taking leg exercising and trying to get more Potassium in my diet. I saw a dr yesterday and he doesn&#39;t think they are related to the vaccine.

                                                After I drove up and got my shot, the people had me drive to the next parking lot and park.  We had to park every other space.  By the time I got parked, I started to feel dizzy.  I was afraid to tell anyone because I didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital.  At first, I felt extremely dizzy so that I would not have driven if I had been allowed.  Then, My heart then started to race for about 5 minutes before it started to calm down.  The person who gave me my shot wrote on my paper on my dashboard that I had to sit for 20 minutes after my shot.   I sat there for the whole 20 minutes and by the time I left, I felt much better, but it scared me it a bit.  I was told to beep my horn if I had a reaction, but I was afraid too.  I sat in my truck and waited to see if it got better or worse.  It did get better.  I was told by friends that I should report it so I am. I have been fine this week since that happened after the vaccination, without any dizziness or heart racing.  But, I am having pain in my left leg and I&#39;m a little worried about that because people are reporting blood clots.  I think I have a vein that is bad in that leg, although I have never been diagnosed with it.   That area has caused me pain in the past but I am so used to it that I normally just ignore it.  There&#39;s just a spot on my left thigh that hurts where I think the veins are bad.  Since the vaccination, I have had more pain in that area.  I don&#39;t know if I need to be concerned with that.  I have been trying to wait that out too.

SHE TOOK TYLENOL FOR HER SYMPTOMS. OVER THE NEXT 2 DAYS THESE SYMPTOMS IMPROVED BUT SHE DEVELOPED A RASH WITH BUMPS ON HER TONGUE, DIZZINESS, AND SLOW COGNITION WHICH LASTED ABOUT 2 DAYS. SHE WAS FINE FOR 24-48 HOURS WHEN ALL THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED SYMPTOMS RETURNED BUT EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED AND SHE HAD EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA WITH INCREASED PAIN AT THE INJECTION SITE.  AT SOME POINT DURING ALL THIS SHE VISITED HER MAIN PHARMACY AND AS SHE WAS TELLING THE PHARMACIST ABOUT HER SYMPTOMS SHE FAINTED AND WOKE TO EMS AND WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL.  THE ER DID NOT FIND ANY REASON FOR HER FAINTING. SHE WAS HYDRATED AND THINKS IT WAS ANXIETY BROUGHT ON BY HER EXPERIENCE.  SHE CALLED ME TODAY 4/15/21 TO TELL ME ABOUT HER SYMPTOMS AND EXPERIENCE. SHE STATED THAT SHE HAD A NEW SYMPTOM OF A SHARP PAIN IN HER BACK SO I STRONGLY SUGGESTED SHE GO BACK TO ER TO CONTINUE TESTING IN CASE THE PAIN WAS SOMEHOW RELATED TO THE VACCINE INCIDENT. SHE SAID SHE WOULD GO TO URGENT CARE IF SHE FELT THE PAIN WAS BAD ENOUGH.

I didn&#39;t know what it was as I hadn&#39;t considered it to be PMS. The next day, day 14 post vaccine, I got my period and ended up in bed with lower back pain, heavier than previous bleeding and headaches. Today, is day five of the menstrual bleeding. While the bleeding is lessening, the cramps and headaches are not. This is not typical for me based on my recollection of PMS/MS. I am concerned that the cramping and headaches have not subsided and I am concerned as to why I am having a period after 13 consecutive months of nothing.

The people who administered the vaccine made me stay at the site for about an hour and a half to make sure that the reaction did not get worse. AE #2) 10 days after receiving the vaccination, the lower part of my left leg began to swell significantly. I went to the emergency room on 4/13/2021. When I was there, they did tests and confirmed that I have a blood clot behind my knee. To treat the blood clot, the emergency room doctor gave me lovenox 110mg and warfarin 5mg. Since then, I have followed up with my primary doctor who has me taking warfarin 10mg ( 1x daily) and lovenox (as needed).

Also started feeling some tightness in the left eye today. Have a Dr appointment but on May 17th and going to urgent care today. Advised to go to HCF instead of urgent just to ensure they can get imaging, US and appropriate testing&#39;s to r/o all cause of complications.  4/20-f/u pc to caller; couldn&#39;t sleep last night; used a heating pad on her leg but didn&#39;t work; states both legs hurt; feel tight; 4/10 pain; worried when also saw spots on her left leg and became concerned because saw news of clots; the episode started with tightness of her right leg which progressed to most of leg as well as left leg. Has not gotten worse today and denies any concominant effects. Normally healthy. Did not go to the hospital because says she wouldn&#39;t be able to afford it. Has appointment with primary care in 2 weeks.   rec&#39;d that since she is still ok today then it&#39;s likely ok to skip the ER and go see MD as planned; warned to go to the ER right away or dial 911 if any of the following effects: sudden shortness of breath, severe headache, vision changes, loss of motor or/sensory function, chest pain. Call us back if having any effects at all besides the ones already noted so we may help determine if needs ER care.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included overweight, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 207A21A expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 06-APR-2021 to left arm for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 07-APR-2021, the patient experienced a mild fever. On 08-APR-2021, the patient was achy and had a mild headache. The headache continued for several day and became pretty bad for about two days. On an unspecified date in Apr-2021 the patient was treated with Tylenol for headache. On 12-APR-2021, the patient experienced leg cramps in her right leg. On 15-APR-2021, the patient had an ultrasound and a blood clot was found in her right leg. The patient started on Apixaban (Eliquis). The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from headache on an unknown date in APR-2021, and the outcome of blood clot, ache, leg cramps and fever was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 50-year-old female was found to have blood clot in her right leg 9 days after receiving Janssen COVID-19 vaccine for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. There was reported mild fever, headache, and &#34;aches&#34; 1 to 2 days after vaccination that was treated with Tylenol.  The symptom reported was leg cramps on right leg 5 days after vaccination, and ultrasound showed blood clot in her right leg 3 days after the symptom of cramps was noted.  No other laboratory/diagnostic test reported.  The patient was treated with apixaban.  The outcome of blood clot in leg was not reported.  Based on the information that is available, the event is assessed as plausible with the causal association to immunization, per causality classification of adverse events following immunization based on a lack of a definitive plausible biological mechanism.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included osteoarthritis, gluten intolarance, and diflucan allergy. The patient was previously treated with fluconazole.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 1805029, expiry: UNKNOWN) with unspecified dose on left arm, on 27-MAR-2021 11:00 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included amino acids NOS, biotin, cannabidiol, collagen, ethinylestradiol/norethisterone acetate, and hyaluronic acid.  On 07-APR-2021, the patient experienced dizziness with standing and intermittently with sitting, tachycardia, dry mouth, chest pressure, shortness of breath, and feeling of extreme doom. On an unspecified date, the patient was transported to the clinic. In the clinic the patient had heart rate of about 140 with irregular beats. The patient had undergone Electrocardiography test which showed ST Depression. The patient&#39;s symptoms were improved by taking nitroglycerin. As the clinic did not have the technology to provide care so the patient was emergently transported to the hospital. In the hospital the patient&#39;s D-dimer level was positive. Later the patient undergone Computerized Angiogram for lungs which showed pulmonary embolism. The patient undergone Dopplers studies of both legs which showed as negative. The patient had received Heparin treatment for several hours and then later switched to Eliquis. After 6 hours being on Eliquis treatment the patient had same original symptoms and for that again nitroglycerin was administered. The patient was placed back on heparin for a longer period of time. Later on the patient got switched to Eliquis 10 mg twice daily for 7 days and further to 5 mg twice daily for 6 to 9 months. The patient had undergone Angiogram of head and neck which was normal. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from tachycardia, feeling of doom/ feeling of passed out and dry mouth on APR-2021, had not recovered from fatigue, dizziness with standing and intermittently with sitting and pulmonary embolism.

When I got parked, within minutes, I got extremely dizzy and then my heart started to race.  I didn&#39;t report it to the military men there because I didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital because I have no health insurance.  I reported this in a previous form but you said I had missing information and gave me no way to update the lot number of the vaccine in your missing information email.  Also, I tried to give blood last night and I was denied due to low hemoglobin.  I have never been told that I had low hemoglobin in my life.  I&#34;m a healthy 173 pound, 5&#39;3&#39;&#39; woman who tracks her diet via my fitness pal.  I walk 3-5 miles a day and yesterday I consumed 113 grams of protien 116 percent of the daily recommended iron intake.

                                                Within 5 minutes from receiving my J&amp;J vaccine, I went to sit down and I started feeling very hot in my body. My heart started to race, had chest discomfort and had trouble breathing, my trachea closed up, had blurry vision and pain in my chest. I felt like I could not breathe and when the nurse came over to ask me I could not speak to her, I went into a shock and I was placed on the floor and I could not hear anything nor could open my eyes, from my hips down to my feet I could not feel anything, my legs went completely numb and I had a syncope. What I was told from the nurse that I was given an Epi-pen to help with my reaction. When I came back my body was having convulsions, felt my head spinning, had pain in my chest that so very intense and the nurse got me up and took me to a nearby ambulance and the EMT staff placed like a heart monitor because my heart was racing super fast. I also felt heaviness in my chest and inside the ambulance I was given two injections on my left arm and when I slowly started coming back, I was already at the hospital. I was at the hospital from 2pm to 4:30pm more less being monitored.  At the hospital x-ray of the chest was performed as well as lab work and I was discharged home. When I got home, I still did not feel good, I felt heaviness to my chest, still have trouble breathing and get chills during the night. I also could not stand up and have a nerve sensation to my body and the chest pain to my left side is still very present. I have blurry vision, dizziness, headaches, and my heart-beat continues to race very fast.  I get headaches, have abdominal pain and I peed blood few times then that&#39;s when I was able to pee, my abdominal pain was painful like having a baby. On Friday 04-08-2021, I again went to the hospital because I had fallen to the floor on my kitchen floor and my daughter took me to the hospital. I let the nurse staff know that I still have continued chest pain and pressure, difficulty breathing and headaches, dizziness and they monitored and gave me three pills as medication. I was discharged home about 5pm with a referral to see a neurologist due to my chest pain, blurry vision, dizziness and fever which I had these past three weeks. I do not know why I felt all these symptoms after my J&amp;J vaccine.

                                                Presented 5/13 to Hospital.  Presented to Hospital on 5/13 with one week of symptoms including cough, dyspnea, diarrhea. COVID-19 testing was positive on 5/8.   Treatments prior to arrival included remdesivir and dexamethasone, started 5/13.  She was also placed on pulse dose steroids 1000 mg/day methylprednisolone given her history of ground glass lung opacities in 2018.  Progressed to high-flow nasal cannula, then BiPAP on 5/14, and was intubated on 5/17.   Paralysis and proning initiated.  Transferred to another hospital for possible VV ecmo candidacy. Patient with severe acute respiratory failure d/t covid who has failed treatment with the ventilator despite paralysis and proning.   CTS asked to place patient on VV ECMO.    5/20/21 1135am  initiated ECMO Patient is a 50yr old female with past medical history of hypertension, asthma, OSA and obesity BMI 41.5 who presented to hospital on 5/13 with progressive cough and shortness of breath for about a week.  Of note, patient also has a history of respiratory failure presenting with ground glass opacities on CT scan in 2018 with unclear etiology despite bronchoscopy and serologic studies which resolved with high dose corticosteroids.  Patient recently tested positive for COVID on 5/8 and received johnson and johnson vaccine in April. Patient was admitted on 5/13 and treated with decadron, remdesivir and tocilizumab.  Course complicated by progressive respiratory failure requiring HFNC followed by Bipap and ultimately intubation on 5/17.  Due to elevated d-dimer, lower extremity dopplers were obtained which were negative, however a heparin gtt was initiated. Course further complicated by cold left lower extremity; arterial duplex demonstrated distal popliteal artery thormbus extending into the peroneal, anterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. therefore heparin was switched to argatroban and a HIT panel was sent.  On 5/19 patient continued to decline despite paralytic and pronning.  Patient transferred to ICU for further level of care and VV ECMO evaluation. On arrival patient was started on veletri; however due to continued respiratory decline a shock call was placed for VV ECMO and patient cannulated for VV @ 1200. Cannulation was difficult and patient was felt to have an IVC thrombus as clot was seen going into the ECMO circuit during cannulation. Post cannulation she developed worsening septic shock and DIC. She received 2uprbc, 1unit cryo, 1 platelet, 2 FFP, 5 liters crystalloid and 1L albumin. Blood cultures positive for GPC in clusters. Escalating vasopressors (Epi/NE/vaso) and ongoing hypoxia family opted to change code status to DNR. Patient then continue to have worsening hemodynamic instability and went into PEA and ultimately asystole. She was pronounced deceased at 1815. Family was en route already due to her instability thus will be notified of her passing once they arrive. Dr. was notified of patients death.

The RN called 911 and patient was taken to the hospital ER. She was discharged after 3-4 hours, some shortness of breath persisted. On April 9, 2021 she experienced increase shortness of breath mid-day and went to the emergency room and was there for 6-7 hours and discharged without diagnosis. On April 13, 2021 in the evening, she had multiple symptoms including shortness of breath, headache, abdominal pain and leg pain. She was watching TV where there were talking about cerebral venous sinus thrombosis associated with the J&amp;J vaccine and cautioned anyone with headache to see MD but she could not get an appointment at her regular clinic. Her husband then took her to the ER again and head CT was negative. She is still not feeling 100% with some shortness of breath on exertion.

The patient said she had no symptoms and no complaints of any fever, tingling, or chills. As a precaution, the patient received a dose of diphenhydramine to counter the potential reaction. After advising the patient to seek medical attention, the patient mentions she spray lavender on her hands and that could have been it. Janssen was contacted and notified. They stated that that symptom was not a symptom found in their drug trials but that they would note it and to advise the patient to seek medical care, which was my recommendation as well.

Emergency Department Attending Attestation Note   See resident/PA/student note for further details of HPI, history, exam, ED course, and diagnoses.   Briefly, this is a 51 y.o. female with PMH reviewed in chart and w/ patient notable for insulin dependent diabetes, depression, prothrombin mutation, migraine, p/w concern for allergic reaction.  Emesis or change in Covid vaccine today.  10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, patient reports feeling thick in her tongue with tingling in her lips.  Patient was given Zertec.  The minutes later, her lips began to swell up and was also noted to have new erythematous rash between her eyes and forehead.  Patient was given 50 mg of Benadryl.  Patient felt like she could not swallow with worsening lip swelling.  She was given EpiPen and 911 was called. No stridors.  No wheezing.  Reports continued tingling and the numbness in her mouth but no lip swelling or tongue swelling.  Denies any difficulty swallowing at this time.  No wheezing.  No abdominal pain or nausea.  No rash at this time.   Of note, patient also notes left-sided facial, arm, and leg numbness starting about 10 minutes prior to arrival to the emergency department.  She reports that she has had recurrent numbness on the left side in the past, which was thought to be due to migraine versus TIA.  She has had extensive work-up and multiple hospitalization for this symptom.  She reports that she is allergic to iodine and gadolinium containing contrast.  Denies any headache at this time though she had a mild headache after receiving the vaccine.  Denies any blurry vision.  Denies any weakness in her bilateral upper and lower extremities.  Assessment and Plan:    Vital signs notable for O2 sat of 96 to 98% on room air without tachypnea.  Patient is mildly hypertensive.  Patient is well-appearing speaking full sentences without any dysarthria.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Extraocular movement intact.  She notes diminished sensation to her left face, left upper extremity, and left lower extremity.  Tongue is midline.  Hearing is intact bilaterally.  No facial droop.  She has 5 out of 5 strength in bilateral upper and lower extremities.  No pronator drift.  Normal gait.  No tongue swelling or lip swelling.  No stridors.  No uvula swelling.  No pharyngeal or erythema.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezing or rhonchi.  Cardiac exam without murmurs rubs or gallops.  Regular rhythm.  No abdominal distention or tenderness on palpation.  No CVA tenderness.   51-year-old female who is presenting to the emergency department with improving lip swelling and numbness in her mouth, raising a concern for anaphylaxis related to her Covid vaccine.  Reassuringly, status post EpiPen, her symptoms are improving.  However, she has new onset left-sided numbness, with without any headache.  She reports that she has had this numbness in the past the last time she had the numbness on the left side was approximately 10 years ago.  Her neurologic exam is only notable for diffuse numbness on her left side including her face.  Differential diagnosis include migraine headache and TIA.  Stroke is possible though less likely given the patient has had the same symptoms in the past with negative work-up.  Will defer code stroke at this time but will emergently consult neurology.  Will get labs including BMP and CBC.  We will continue to monitor her from the anaphylaxis perspective.  We will also give her a dose of steroid.  Prednisone 60 mg by mouth given 12:29 PM  NEUROLOGY CONSULT NOTE  Assessment: Formulation- Diagnosis is guarded. Localization structurally would suggest subcortical (thalamic) or small brain-stem in a sensory territory on the right. Etiologies could be stroke given her vascular risk factors but seems unlikely given there is stereotypy of earlier symptomatology. Demyelinating would be another possibility as well, but again, the stereotype. Seizure unlikely because of the timing of rush from toes to body was minutes and duration of some occasions being days. Complicated migraine possible, has some risk factors, but should be treated as dx of exclusion. She does make complaint of headache, which could support. Some FND elaboration on her anxiety-ridden allergic reaction is also possible, but no objective non-structural signs to support.

                                                Following the vaccine injection which was provided by the personnel, I have developed minor fainting spells and angina for the past 10 plus days. A large dried blood clot was noted on the first day of my period which occurred on March 16th. I continue to pass large blood clots while I was having my period. I also want to point out that a personnel who gave me an injection was incorrectly injected the vaccine outside of the area of the preferred injection zone. I have reported this event to the supervisor who was on site. I have not yet contacted my health care provider at this time but plan to contact her tomorrow as these symptoms have been persisting.

                                                She developed a large pulmonary embolus, and she died on 3/17 at Hospital. She developed symptoms of SOB on 3/11, and was admitted to the hospital. She was initially stable and not requiring oxygen and was sent home on anticoagulation. However she returned the same day with worsening symptoms, troponin now elevated, and ECHO showing signs of right heart strain. Embolus on imaging had increased in just over days from previous CT scan. She became pulseless and died despite resuscitative efforts. It is my opinion (Dr.) that she died of a pulmonary embolus, and an autopsy is pending.

I had a follow up appointment on March 26; he said that he had seen patients who experienced the same, and it was due to the vaccine. Unlike them, my pain remained. He thinks that the vaccine triggered something else in me. After his appointment, I saw my orthopedist who prescribed meds to help with leg pain. If pain is not better in a month, then he will order a MRI. I saw my rheumatologist Monday, April 5. She is going to work with my orthopedists to treat me. Currently, I am doing the exercises that were prescribed for me to do at home, and I am on pain meds.

The chest pains are the main thing I want to report. It lasted through the next day. I thought it was just me but my daughter&#39;s friend said the her friends mother also experience really bad chest pains the next day after her covid vaccine. Also, my husband just received a different covid vaccine and experienced chest pains. I thought it was worth reporting.  Several weeks later I received my second dose of Shingles vaccine and also experienced chest pains the next day. This didn&#39;t happen with the first dose. I thought maybe they have similar ingredients?

They ran blood work and did a CT Scan and chest x-ay.  I told the ER that I had the covid vaccination the Tuesday prior but they said I would have already had symptoms.  They didn&#39;t ask which vaccination.  They said they thought I had vertigo and gave me Antivert.   They said I should follow up with an ENT, Cardiologist and Gastroenterologist.  When I went for the follow-u p with a Cardiologist, they scheduled a stress test (May 21st) and an Echocardiogram ( May 11th).  The Gastro doctor wants a endoscopic and colonoscopy but wont schedule until I have clearance from the Cardiologist.

                                                About 10 to minutes after vaccine I had a strange wave warm sensation running through my body and tingling. I got this sensation about 4 times that day. Twice at vaccine facility and 2 more times at home that same day. Then in the past couple of weeks I?ve had numbness in the right side of my face, arm/hand and leg/foot. Sharp pains in my head, PVC, eye pressure, vision issues, shortness of breath, electric shock sensations through my body, head tingling. Not sure the cause of these symptoms but the only different/new thing was the vaccine.

Within first 3-4 hours had bad rash on arms, legs, face, neck and chest, fast heartrate, breathing and out of it sensation. I felt like I was having a partial analpylaxis reaction - like throat 1/2 closed but that I would be ok. I took Benadryl and used a Ventolin inhaler. Rash was better by 2nd day.  On 2nd and 3rd day I was having massive headache (felt like pressure from inside all over out to all cranial sutures), severe neck stiffness on rt side, lumbar vertebrate pain, iliosacral and hip pain, felt painful radiating spasms down my left and right legs, also jaw and teeth pain. Taking Naproxen and now ASA.  Very shakey and jittery. Occasionally have lower arm pain and numbness on left side. Also have injection site symptoms but minor compared to above. It&#39;s been 1 week and allergic part of rxn is over but concerned with possible neuro and bloodclot possibilties..  On day 2 or 3 I also had problems with my brain with reading comprahension.

It repeated every few minutes or so, for hours. Upon sleep and a muscle relaxant, it did not re-occur. However approximately 4 days later, (today) I experienced very similar &#34;spasms&#34; in my left rib cage area, just below my breast. They feel like a muscle spasm, lasting only seconds, but repeat within minutes for hours.

                                                Bad headache developed on April 8th at 11 AM.  By 2:30,  needed to sleep.  Unconscious for 3 and 1/2 days.   I have no recollection of any of this time.  I?m only listening to what have  told by the medical field and my family.   My husband started calling MEDICAL CENTER Friday morning and A called the helicopter by Friday afternoon at three.   They were ruling out a stroke.  By the time they landed the helicopter they knew it was not a stroke and started doing testing like CAT scans , lumbar punctures.  From what I?ve been told they ran four antibiotics IVs.  I remember waking up Sunday morning and someone was sitting in the chair next to me and all I kept saying was that I was hungry.  The lady started crying and said that I had been unconscious.  She tried to tell me who I was and that I was something called married and that I had children.  She tried to explain what had happened but I wasn?t able to comprehend.  I didn?t know what it meant that I lived on a farm or that I had animals.  Or that we had a vet practice.   I remember medical people asking me who I was and what the date was and if I remember how I got there and all I could do was smile.   It?s like the words just would not come.  And they diagnosed it as an cephalitis over the next couple days.  Where the brain swells up and you have memory loss and I had a high fever.  I had a lot of nausea after they put me on oral anabiotic?s.  I kept hearing from nurse reports that I had almost died.  These were hard things to here.  I?m forever thankful for all the people that have gone before me for doing the drug trials.    I am a energetic lady and I?m slowly getting back to myself.  I feel very thankful for the great care at the medical center.  I appreciate everything that you do every day.   I would not recommend getting vaccinated with this drug.  I am one of the healthiest people that I know. No I can?t believe this is happened to me.  I take good care and eat healthy and have no bad habits. I meditate and pray and have a joy filled life.

By 4/15/19, they dropped some more and seem to have leveled out (4/19/21), but still testing weekly. ANA blood work positive, but no other symptoms to fit most common autoimmune diseases. Saw rheumatologist today for more blood work.

                                                Immediately after injection. I felt a heat go from my head to toes and down my arms into my hands. My lower legs, feet, hands, left arm and chest begin to tingle. After sitting a few minutes it did not get worse. The tingling is not constant now, but I am still having it. Seems like I have it in the left arm more often than anywhere else.  Within 20 minutes of the shot I began having gastrointestinal issues., that progressed.  It built into strong chest pressure, acid reflux and indigestion. I got into the Dr on March 25. He prescribed Nexium. I am now having significant hair loss and have started having heart palpitations. I am waiting on his response as to what tests are needed to proceed.

After about an hour, it completely subsided and I didn&#39;t feel dizziness anymore. I did not receive any treatment for this.  Also, on the fourth day after vaccination (April 13), I felt pressure/tightness in my chest. Because the blood clot cases had been publicized, I called my doctor, who advised me to go to the emergency room of our local hospital. They gave me an EKG, which looked fine, and said they thought the tightness might be related to my asthma (although that is not a symptom I have ever felt with my asthma before, which usually manifests as slight wheezing). The chest tightness lasted about two days and then went away completely without treatment.

                                                Reported adverse effects to J&amp;J after a horrible day/night from severe allergic reaction. We were 5 hrs from home, on a weekend, could not get vaccines in our county. Drove to  County. After the 15 min when walking out of the building noticed strong metallic taste in mouth (no fillings), thought odd. Then while driving noticed red blemishes/rash on neck, swelling of my tongue. Once arrived at hotel (too far to drive back home and not feeling well), noticed red rash on front of neck, ear lobes bright red, hot to the touch and swollen. Vertigo and low fever came on along with elevated heart rate. These lasted all Saturday into Sunday. Didn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t sleep Saturday night, Sunday morning rash on face with heart rate BPM elevated all day with fever and bad vertigo. All these symptoms continued all week with exception to the rash and swollen tongue those subsided late Sunday. The vertigo, fevers, skin sensitivity and complete fatigue along with bump at injection site persisted even to today.

                                                Saturday, April 3, my heart rate went up and I didn&#39;t feel well. My blood pressure was a little high. I did not go into the doctor at that time. My heartrate went basically normal that night. But it was doing things like that for a few days off and on after that. Two weeks ago this Thursday, (8th) I did go to ER - my back was starting to hurt and my blood pressure was high. I was prescribed a medication for heart palpitations - Propranolol. I&#39;ve taken it a couple of weeks. The heart palpitations have not gone away. I&#39;m having them quite a bit. I have to hit the button on the Zio Patch every time I have symptoms and I&#39;ve had quite a few.  Note: Shingrix vaccine on April 11th, injection on my left arm; and that was dose 1 or 2 - Lot # 444M2.

                                                By 6pm I noticed something wasn?t right. I could t get warm, even when sitting in the sunshine. By 9pm the chills had turned to fever. My temperature at 9pm was 101.2F.  I also had a headache and started to feel a bit shaky.  By 10pm I had body aches and was in bed with 3 blankets on me and still could not get warm. My temp was 102.7 at 10pm. I tried to sleep. At midnight I awoke to a fever of 104.8 and could only cry. The worst body aches, headache, racing heart and dizziness, nausea and vomiting (after additional aspirin were taken to relieve the fever). I was very weak in an alarmingly rapid period. I stayed in this condition until approximately 6:30am on 4/26. At 7am my temp was 102.5 and I found it hard to make it back and forth to the bathroom, due to dizziness and weakness. By noon, the temp was back up to 103.1 and I could barely cry, as I suspected I was then  close to dehydration. I focused on hydration and slept as much as possible. The fever slowly came down to its current 100.4 at 11pm on 4/27.  This has been an alarming reaction to a vaccine. I have had serum sickness previously, so maybe that is a factor that should also be considered. I hope this is helpful.

                                                Patient has had chronic intermittent pain on her left lower leg for the past 5 years. However, she has noticed more pain on the left lower leg since having the COVID-19 Janssen vaccine on 3/19/2021. She is a chronic smoker. Thus, a left lower extremity arterial doppler was done on 5/20/2021 which incidentally revealed a DVT in the gastronemius vein of the left lower extremity. A subsequent bilateral US venous doppler of both lower extremities was done which revealed no DVT. Therefore, a repeat venous doppler of the left lower extremity was ordered for today, 5/21/2021, and remains pending at this time. Of note, patient was started on eliquis on 5/20/2021 (10 mg BID for the first 7 days with subsequent decrease to 5 mg BID thereafter). She will be referred to a hematologist for continued management.

                                                Dizziness and shortness of breath. Unable to catch breath easily. Went to  the first Saturday after my Vaccine shot. occasion I was treated for labyrnthitis at visit on 4/17/2021  which attributed to the dizziness. Dizziness lasted 3 weeks but increasingly got better over time. I still felt a tightening in my chest after this visit and breathing felt a bit labored. It felt better when standing upright but was difficult laying down especially on my sides. I went back to on 4/20/2021 for a follow up. Lungs looked clear from X-Rays. Was treated for Asthma like symptoms but have never been treated for Asthma previously. Symptoms have improved. I am able to sleep on my side now but will still have times where I can&#39;t seem to breathe evenly when I lay down.

                                                Both sides of my neck were very swollen. There was extreme pain on my right arm. The pain was severe and numbness in my finger. I went to the ER and they said I have radial thrombus, a clot in the radial artery.  Before the shot, my heart was checked multiple times and I was fine. After the shot, my coronary arteries are now very small. There are now luminal changes inside my coronary arteries which are still now very small. I now have been diagnosed with CAD. I had a heart cath on March 29. My arm is still in a lot of pain. My neck is still swollen.

                                                I was still having chest pain and breathing problems prior to getting it, so they wanted me to get the vaccine because if I got COVID, it would kill me. Over the weeks, my breathing worsened and I had terrible chest pains. They did another CT Scan to make sure I didn&#39;t have another embolism. The symptoms of my other conditions flared as well. I got the vaccine 3 or 4 days before the news was released about the blood clots. I&#39;m still experiencing breathing issues, chest pains and dizziness. I&#39;m now on additional meds for my lupus: Cymbalta and Lyrica. They&#39;re trying to help with the chest pain and polymyalgia. I was also given a Lidoderm patch to help with my chest pain. It just seems like everything got worse afterwards. I&#39;m not sure if my lungs will ever function at 100% due to everything going on.

                                                I experienced worsening breathing, very painful, feel I cannot catch my breath. I have hoarseness in my voice. I have had terrible chest pain that when I take in a deep breath, I have to hold my chest. I feel my symptoms are getting worse since receiving the J&amp;J vaccine. I have had prior CT and MRI scans since November 2020. Everyone was worried sick about me since I live alone and a month ago, I thought I was having another pulmonary embolism. They again did lab work, CT scan, MRI scan and a D-dimer. My quality of life had drastically changed since receiving the J&amp;J vaccine. I cannot go outside or work in my yard. I was given a Pro-air inhaler by my doctor and was told to use it when I am having trouble breathing, that I need to use it consistently. I gasp for air which worries me because I did not have to do this before. I also feel lightheaded and dizzy at times when getting up from a seated position. My lupus also has horrendously worsened with the vaccine. I also never picked up a cigarette to smoke in my life. My quality of life has been turned upside down since getting the J&amp;J vaccine all my symptoms flared up.

                                                About six or seven hours after the shot I started to feel bad, first some in my chest, then a scratchy throat with swollen glands, then mild body aches.   The next day the sore throat was gone, and body aches got worse. All my joints ache. I felt chilled in spite of outdoor temperature of 79, and a hot bath, blankets and sitting in front of a fire. It was 74 inside the house. I started to get a bit of a headache but it never developed into a full headache. At about 6pm (day 2) I started to get  hot. Anything touching my skin bothered me.   At about 7pm (day 2) I took two Tylenol and the symptoms improved by about  8:30pm.

I was experiencing headaches all day. The following morning on Sunday I woke up and passed out, I guess my blood pressure dropped and I don?t know why and this is never happened.  Had no appetite since Friday and maybe that?s why but my BP is 120/60 as of 10:08am AFTER I passed out at around 8:30am. I?m now feeling better all of a sudden, can drink coffee and hopefully I?ll get a shower....... oh and my joints are sore, I think whatever could go wrong , did!

                                                On the day of vaccination I was treated at the site for a reaction which started 40 minutes after the shot. I was hypertensive and Tachycardia and I had chest tightness . I was monitored for 90 minutes and I had taken some Prednisone and they gave me Allegra. I left there and six hours later I felt worse. I had been having intermittent chest pain. My chest pain got worse and my heart rate was elevated so I went the ED. I was given Benadryl and Pepcid. I was discharged after two hours but I still had some chest pain. I took another dose of Steroids after four days I felt better.  I have a scheduled Stress Test at Hospital for follow up. I still have some burning chest pain on occasion.

She drank some water and then we took her blood pressure. she started to feel better and then felt a tighness in her neck. I retook her blood pressure and it was elevated. She then began having the chills, upon the last reading of blood pressure we call emergency services because it was elevated again. The last time we took her bp before emergency services came the reading was better. Ems checked her vitals and after a while let her decide whether or not she needed to go the hospital. She chose to leave and her son drove her home.

Within an hour the pain started radiating throughout my whole body.  The intensity of the pain in all of my muscles and joints was very sharp and intense, like when you throw your back out.  I also ran a low fever, and my pulse became very low.  I  had extreme fatigue and headache for two days.  Arm was sore for a week.

I received shot, and within a minute or two- my lips and tongue started to tingle, swell and go numb.  My throat started to swell too.  Had a hard time starting to breathe and took my xopenex inhaler.  I had taken a benadryl beforehand, and ended up taking two more as EMT came over to  help me there at the site.  She kept an eye on me.  My A Fib was speeding up and getting irregular too.  After about half an hour, it stopped getting worse and seemed to level off.  They offered to take me to ER, and had me promise to call 911 if it got bad again.  Still felt bad the rest of the day.  Felt a little better later the next day, and a little better (today is day 3), but still not 100%.  I did contact my doctor to check in

The next day, I developed chest pain, racing heart, shortness of breath, and insomnia. I continue to have chest pain. On 04/08/2021, without injury or anything that I did, my right middle finger swelled and turned purple and it&#39;s still purple. The ER doctor said it was a hematoma.

I felt my heart feel like it was occasionally fluttering (overall felt this about 4 times).  Restlessness through the night.  I took two Tylenol at 10pm, one Tylenol at 4 am and one Tylenol at 6am.  The Tylenol helped but I could tell when it was leaving my system Friday, the following day: fever of 101.6, acute nausea.  Took Tylenol every 4 hours which did help. Saturday, felt much better but had sweating most of the day.  The sweating subsided at night Sunday morning, still sweating.  I also had weird vivid dreams since taking the vaccine.  Could be unrelated but I usually don&#39;t have dreams like that

I became so dizzy, lightheaded that 2 people had to hold me up and escorted me (as I slouched) to a tented cot in the area. I felt I drifted back and forth into a black out state for about 20 minutes.

Unable to fall back to sleep I continued to lie in down. Around 8 hours later, it had slowed down a lot. This is when I checked my pulse with our machine  and it registered at 126 while resting. It was already much slower than during the night which I would guess the range to be 150-160.  In hindsight, I probably should have gone to the emergency but I was very tired and running a low grade temperature.

I was transported by ambulance to the hospital. A CT and MRI was done, no signs of blood clots or stroke.  I am still experiencing numbness and tingling in the right arm. Follow up appointments with the eye doctor indicate additional vision loss in the right eye with pressure behind the eye. I have a follow up appointment today with the neurologist for a brain scan and tomorrow for an eeg. My PCP, eye doctor, and neurologist believe it may be a blood flow issue. I have not had this type of event before.

Chest tightness started on 3-27-2021 and still on going today.    I didn&#39;t think anything of the chest pain or the headache because I suffer with migraine headaches and occasional shortness of breath due to (CHF)

                                                Lady had vaccine, was told it was Janssen but lot # is Moderna.  She got the vaccine, the night of the vaccine around 5:30 she got a raging headache (she does get reactions to most vaccines).  She took Tylenol and her arm did hurt.  The next day she was still really hurting, her headache was really, really bad, and it stayed until Sunday.  Then on Sunday she was ok.  On Monday when she went to work and her right arm went limp, and while she was walking her right leg gave way and almost fell, grabbed hold and steadied herself.  The raging headache/migraine came back and she started getting nauseous, her lower back hurt, her upper neck area hurt like somebody was pounding her neck.  Then she got diarrhea and really really tired on Monday and Tuesday and also had loss of appetite.  Then yesterday 4/13/201 she just had the headache and a sound in her ear, went to UC and got drops for it.  Her temperature was 96.5, and her normal is 98.7, and was told that she was really cold.  Her PB was really high and the doctor took it again but it was not as high, attributed it to anxiety.  Last night the lower abdomen pain started, feeling like she was getting her period which she has not had in over a year.  She saw a little blood on her panty liner, and was thinking she was going to have a period, but the pain is excruciating in her lower abdomen.   She has also taken Tylenol off and on for her symptoms, and feels like she is cramping.     She is having hot/cold flashes as well, and has not had these issues from menopause.

Patient is an avid runner who runs three to four times week. Today (4/15/21), patient developed tachycardia in the high 180s ten minutes into her run. She then stopped running and started walking on flat surface for 30 minutes in hopes to slow down her heart rate. However, after 30 minutes of walking her heart rate remained in the 185 to 205 beats per minutes. The tachycardia lasted for one hour since she stopped running. She then came to the ED for check ups.

The patient recovered from syncope/lost consciousness, and was recovering from light headed, vomiting/persistent emesis, and anaphylactic reaction, stopped breathing. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused/ Prolonged, and Life Threatening).; Sender&#39;s Comments: v0 A 52-year-old female patient with the past medical history remarkable for anaphylaxis to peanuts experienced anaphylactic reaction the same day the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Ad26.COV2 was administered. The patient began to feel light-headed and lost consciousness, an epi-pen was administered. The next day the patient stopped breathing and was treated in the local ER (emergency room). Later she had persistent emesis. Given the close temporal relationship and history of anaphylaxis to peanuts the events are considered related.

Became dizzy and nauseous and had difficultly breathing.  Went to pass out due to blood pressure drop.  Had to breath in alcohol wipes and then both arms went into pain as if falling asleep only 100 times worse.  Could not moves my arms - hands were cramping.  Took 1 hour to get back to some normal to drive home. The next day/Tues my sinuses where still a little swollen along with a little bit of arm pain, nausea and fatigue.   Wed - Fri sinuses continued to be swollen then on Fri - Sun had coughing.  Following Mon was weaker and feeling low immune.  Tues ended up at doctor&#39;s office having gone into a sinus infection.  Was also experiencing shallow breathing in neck and chest.  Started Augmentin 875mg 2 x a day Tues - Fri.  Then Fri night went into a severe inflammation in my chest, throat and esophagus with difficulty to catch my breath and couldn&#39;t eat.  Sat reached out to document through EMR and was prescribed a Steroid (6 days) which I started on Sun morning.  Was very weak and took that whole week with full does of steroid to get back to normal breathing.  Finished Antibiotics (12 days worth) 2 days after completing the steroid which was now Sunday.  Then still had some sinus recovery where ear was beeping in and out for 2 more days.  By Wed of the 4th week things were returning to normal.  Total time to recover was exactly 4 weeks.

                                                This is my second report (same vaccine Johnson and Johnson on March 23 lot #1805031) because my symptoms are still present; my first report was on 04/07/2021. I currently have depression, tinnitus, fatigue, brain fog, sometimes I feel shaky on the inside, swaying at times, and dizziness/vertigo. I sent follow-up information for my first VAERS report via mail and a pdf document to VAERS webpage; I attempted to fax several times but it came back unsuccessful; I left a message for a representative to return my call and nobody called back. I want to make sure you get this information, hence this second report.  Additional Follow-up Information: Hospital Emergency Room visit on April 8, 2021: purple finger, racing heart, chest pain. EKG, body scan for blood clots, and blood panel.  Doctor video visit on April 16, 2021: chest pain, feeling horrible, shortness of breath, metallic taste in the mouth, tinnitus, insomnia, anxiety, and depression.  Doctor office visit on April 29, 2021: headache, dizziness, fatigue, brain fog, stress, depression, thirsty, pressure at temples and back of head and forehead, rocking, anxiety.

                                                The second night after the shot I was awakened out of a sound sleep at 3AM  with a pain across the entire top of my upper chest (at the top of the breast region) it was a though someone had turned a 2x4 on its side and was standing on it.  I was clammy and had some hives on my back and hips. I sat on the side of the bed I stretched my arms did some yoga type moves trying to see if being less active the day after the shot maybe had my back a little tight causing the pain.  I chewed two tums thinking that might help to get rid of the pain even though I knew it was worse than heartburn. After 15 mins at 3:15 I woke my husband to let him know it was not going away and that I was not sure what was going on but just in case I did not want to be ridiculous and sit there and have a heart attack. I&#39;m not one to run to the doctor, I&#39;m very healthy but thought to myself this may be more serious.  My husband ask about calling for help and I said lets just see what happens and just know if I need help then you at least know my symptoms now . I woke the next morning and felt much better and made a joke about all the crazy people being right stating &#34;they are trying to kill us&#34;  Later in the week on Thursday playing tennis I felt me left arm going numb, I shrugged it off to hitting the ball hard and it never crossed my mind about anything else. Two weeks to the day on Sunday Morning I woke with a migraine that made me feel I was going to throw up.   The news just came out about J&amp; J and the few family members that knew about my adverse reaction urged me to report and go to the Dr.   I&#39;m currently dealing with a bruise (I usually don&#39;t bruise badly) on my left front chin- I could have hit it on something who knows but it has been there now over a week.

                                                I started feeling pain in my arm and shoulder, but I didn&#39;t pay much attention to it. The next day, the area above my breast was hurting and tight. My husband took me to a healthcare facility and they took xrays and blood. They wanted to admit me, but I didn&#39;t want to stay. They gave me Tramadol for pain and told me to relax when I got home and to see my PCP. I was eventually able to get in about a week later and he did an ultrasound of my heart, an EKG and last week I took a stress test--which was abnormal and I have to go get my results today. I feel a lot better, but I still have pain in my chest area occasionally.

                                                Soreness in my left arm at the injection site area. I treated with ibuprofen. It was fine the next day - used a lot of motion to help. I rubbed it and I guess I wasn&#39;t suppose to. I had no other issues until my typical seasonal allergies but a week an a half later - Saturday, I noticed I was having symptoms and was notified by a family member, that family member on Tuesday after I started having symptoms that they had a positive test. So I got tested at a Rapid Test site. I had productive cough and sinus congestion and some chest pain and shortness of breath. That went on for about a week and a half. I contacted my physician after the positive COVID test and because I have asthma related to the Hiatal hernia - and I increased to maximum dosage on Advair. That worked. Mucinex with Sudafed to dry that out. And started to use Cool Mist Humidifier and had that in my room constantly and I did self isolate to my bedroom during that time.  Vicks vapor rub on my chest. I wasn&#39;t running a fever - it varied slightly but it never went over 99. My highest temperature I think was 98. I monitored my O2 with finger monitor - as I had shortness of breath doing stairs. Lowest around 88 but then it would return to 96 or 97 in about 15 minutes.  Follow up with doctor (primary care doctor) - telemed appt.

I finally got the water and 800mg of ibuprofen went back to bed and slept until 11am, got up no headache but since then I have been experiencing hot flashes daily the rest of March and into April a few in May. I realize that I am of the age to experience hot flashes heading into menopause but this was to coincidental and I had never had hot flashes before.

                                                I started with getting red, hard knots in my leg. They were hard, hard knots. Almost felt like  blood clot. My blood pressure rose extremely high like never before. Then I got edema. I went to the vein doctor. I saw the nurse assistant and they said it wasn&#39;t a blood clot. Finally, I got to see him at another visit and he thought it was bug bites. But it sounded odd like that I would have these red splotches up and down my legs and they were hard and he put me on Prednisone. The symptoms disappeared completely. About 4 -6 days after the medication was over, all the symptoms re-appeared. At some point, I went to the ER - because I was worried about blood clots. They gave me Cephlex - as they thought it was bug bites  - so I was on that for 6 or 7 days. And the symptoms got better with this medication - made it better but not disappear like Prednisone did. Then after that, it was horrible again - the symptoms. I have an appt tomorrow to get checked again. I have never have had this stuff before in my life. My blood pressure is elevated but not so high as it was in the beginning. My legs are in pain - I can&#39;t even touch them. My skin so red  - it looks like it&#39;s on fire. I went to Orthopedic doctor thinking it was related to a previous injury or sprain. But they said it wasn&#39;t related to that at all .The skin so tight gets so tight and sore that I can barely walk. The skin is broken like it&#39;s thin and very fragile. My left leg is  significantly worse than the right leg in the calf area (it&#39;s two times the size as the right calf).  Still have edema I can&#39;t hardly wear shoes. At the end of the day, it&#39;s worse, but still in the morning now they are still swollen.

Rph caught her as she started to lean forward and she almost fell but I was able to get her to turn sideways and instead lay down on bench rather than fall forward.  So she basically fainted for a minute and then laid for awhile while 911 was called. Ambulance arrived and patient remained conscious.

The EMT&#39;s were called, my blood pressure was really low, but as I sat up for a while it got better and I was able to go home. The next day my arm was really sore, I took too ibuprofen twice that day which helped. The next morning I woke up with hives all over my upper body that&#39;s itchy.

I still feel like more core is on fire, but it has subsided and is less concerning as it was on Friday, 3/26/2021, and Saturday, 3/27/2021  My eyes became sensitive to light on Friday, 3/26/2021 night and my eyes are still sensitive especially to artificial lighting. Natural light hurts as well but is more tolerable.  My heart rate definitely increased Friday, 3/26/2021 through Saturday, 3/27/2021 however I did not experience the other symptoms on the critical list (such as inability to breathe) therefore did not go to the hospital.  I suffered from muscle weakness on Friday, 3/262021, and Saturday, 3/27/2021. The muscle weakness was only in my legs.

She said she is not feeling well, and her eye was rolling (as if when she tried to look up and couldn&#39;t get their eye to remain open) a for about few seconds and then she her eye was open back to normal.  She was sweating on both hands and face were cold to the touch.  I got the manager from the store to help me lie patient flat on the floor&#39;s surface gently to prevent her from falling off the chair.    Based on this our adverse event protocol, patient exhibited similar symptoms to Syncope (paleness, sweating, coldness of extremities), so I patient is lying flat on the floor, feet elevated, and cold compression was apply on her arms and face.  Unfortunately, patient conditions was not improving as it seem but she was alert and able to breath (fast pace) the whole entire time the incident occurred where she answer all questions when we myself, then the paramedics asked her questions.  Paramedic arrived at scene within 10 minutes after individual got off the phone with 911.  They took her away around 9 am and said patient probably experience anxiety attack.

                                                Roughly 25-30 minutes following receiving the shot, I became extremely dizzy and weak.  A few minutes later I felt difficulty breathing and realized that my throat was swelling.  My heart began to race, but I cannot say if that was a result of the other symptoms I was experiencing.   The dizziness and weakness lasted for about 2 hours. The difficulty breathing and swollen throat eased after about 7 hours.  Just as I thought that I was feeling better, a fever set in around 11pm along with the chills, joint aches and pains, and general malaise. These flu-like symptoms lasted for roughly 36 hours.

                                                after receiving shot, I waited 30 min, because I had bells palsy in the past  (about 16 years ago) it was an extra pre caution, approximately an hour later I felt slight dizziness which was not a concern for me  and passed quickly.  approx 2 or so hours later i got a bad stomach cramp similar to a bad menstral cramp however I am menopausal so this was unusual.  I believe it happened 2 or 3 times, that afternoon and maybe once the following day but never again.  The next day after my vaccine 04/04 I experienced a very low fever, came and went most bothersome was the chill and tiredness i felt by evening,  by 04/05 every symptom was gone just a bit of sore arm.  I was away on vacation when I heard the news about the pause and was concerned because I had stomach cramps .  These cramps were just after the shot and came and went quickly so maybe not much of an issue.  Upon return from my vacation last night, I blew my nose and there was blood in my right nostril.  it was not a flowing blood and I think it may have just been caused by the dry air in the airplane?  it was approximately 5.5 hr flight.  Maybe not related but thought I would mention it.

She did not feel well, drank one beer, and ate a packet of tuna. She continued to not feel well and felt the food did not go down correctly, so she reached into her throat and noticed blood. She called her doctor and the doctor recommended monitoring for increased bleeding. Later that night, she reports not feeling well again, made herself throw up, and noticed the vomit was all blood. The patient then called 9-1-1, and presents to the hospital. During the hospital visit she noticed that she saw &#39;blood clots about the size of a quarter&#39; when she went to the bathroom. Patient reports the hospital gave her 4 pints of blood, 4 bags of &#39;yellow stuff&#39; (patient assumes its plasma), protonix, antibiotics, and NS. Patient was in the ICU and reports being in the hospital for about 5 days total, whenever the doctor recommended being put on hospice. The patient did want to be put on hospice and wants to be treated, so she contacted her heart doctor and is waiting on an appointment with him on the 28th of April. Patient reports that doctor told her that she &#39;needs a new heart&#39;, but that she is not a good candidate, and that the Dr. told her this just a day or two ago. Patient reports that she did not know it was a tear in her throat (esophagus) until they &#34;stuck a scope down there&#34;.

                                                Patient presented to Emergency Department on 4/17/21 with a severe headache that started 5-7 days prior. CBC and Chem-8 were normal with platelets of 314.  Findings from CT head venogram showed irregularities of the left transverse sinus with possible sinus thrombosis. Patient was admitted for further work-up and treatment. Patient was followed by Neurology. On 4/18 MRI revealed no cavernoma seen and no stroke or hemorrhage. Per Neurology, the areas of filling defects seen on CTV are still present which could be nonocclusive thrombus vs stenosis with prominent arachnoid granulations, but given history and risk factors, would treat as cerebral sinus venous thrombosis. Patient was treated with heparin then transitioned to apixaban, which she was discharged on. Patient was instructed to follow up with neurology in 3 months for a repeat CTV. Patient was discharged 4/19/21.

The patient had no known allergies.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 1805029, and expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 16-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included Centrum Multi-Gummies for Women.  On an unspecified date in MAR-2021 the patient began to experience slowly progressive shortness of breath; on 01-APR-2021 she had left upper quadrant pain. On 03-APR-2021 the patient presented to the emergency room.  Laboratory data included: Pulmonary Angiogram/CT Chest - abnormal and computerised tomogram abdomen/pelvis at 09:37, showed segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the lower lobes of both lungs. Small volume perisplenic hemorrhage and small volume pneumoperitoneum in the pelvis or findings concerning for spontaneous splenic rupture and moderately enlarged spleen. Additional CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast at 23:05 showed: Small to moderate amount of hemoperitoneum, slightly increased since the earlier study. There is definitely new blood adjacent to the liver. The hemorrhage adjacent to the spleen appears similar to the earlier study. Due to the timing of the scans with relation to the contrast injection, the physician could not confirm a splenic laceration, although it was suspected to be the source of hemorrhage. Small amount of mesenteric blood was slightly increased. Continuous heparin infusion was started for bilateral pulmonary embolism. On 04-APR-2021, an inferior vena cava filter was placed and patient was vaccinated with Acthib (HIB Vaccine), Bexsero (meningococcal vaccine) and Prevnar (pneumococcal vaccine) in anticipation of splenectomy. On 07-APR-2021, a laparoscopic splenectomy was performed. The spleen was evaluated by pathology which reported that organizing blood clot on surface was consistent with rupture. No evidence of malignancy was reported.  The patient was also treated with anticoagulant therapy (dates unspecified). The patient remained inpatient while recovering from surgery.  On 12-APR-2021, the patient was transitioned to rivaroxaban for therapeutic anticoagulation. Patient remained hospitalized as of 12-APR-2021.  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from pulmonary embolism, haemoperitoneum, mesenteric haemorrhage, splenic haemorrhage, splenic rupture, splenic thrombosis, splenomegaly, dyspnoea, abdominal pain upper, and left upper quadrant/abdominal pain. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, Disability Or Permanent Damage).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 53-year-old female patient of unspecified ethnicity was found to  have pulmonary embolism and spontaneous splenic rupture 18 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  No concurrent illness and medical history reported. Emergency room consult for slowly progressive shortness of breath and left upper quadrant pain that starts on an unspecified date after vaccination.   Pulmonary Angiogram/CT Chest showed segmental and subsegmental pulmonary emboli in the lower lobes of both lungs; small volume perisplenic hemorrhage and small volume pneumoperitoneum in the pelvis; moderately enlarged spleen with findings concerning for spontaneous splenic rupture.  CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast showed small to moderate amount of hemoperitoneum, slightly increased since the earlier study; definite new blood adjacent to the liver.  Continuous heparin infusion was started; vaccinated with Acthib (HIB Vaccine), Bexsero (meningococcal vaccine) and Prevnar (pneumococcal vaccine).  Laparoscopic splenectomy was done 22 days after vaccination; pathology report is consistent with splenic rupture with no evidence of malignancy.  The patient was shifted to rivaroxaban.  No other details reported. The information available regarding splenic rupture precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  Based on the information that is available, the event pulmonary embolism is assessed as plausible with the causal association to immunization, per WHO causality classification of adverse events following immunization based on a lack of a definitive plausible biological mechanism; considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, the potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.

Then the vein just below my wrist swelled up and turned blue. The next morning when I woke, the vein was no longer swollen, but the area below my wrist had a large bruise, which lasted several days.   I contacted my physician that day (3/18) who said just to monitor/observe and come in if continuing issues (which there were not).

I had all over body aches for two days but my hands still ache after tree weeks. I woke up in the morning an noticed a big bulging blue vein in my right eyelid right above the outer part of my eye. One week later my thumb started to throb and then a big bulging blue vein in my left thumb. It felt like it had been injured but it looked better within hours. I called my doctor and he advised that I go to the ER. I also had trouble with my head throbbing for a week after the shot.  My eye was painful and lasted a little over a week and my eyes were a little blurry. Both problems have resolved but I still have an ache in my hands after three and a half weeks. It is a deep bone ache which makes it difficult to work with my hands.

It was muscular - it moved up from my chest to shoulder the next day and then went away after about a week. I was icing it and massaging it and taking muscle relaxers.  I had a routine visit with cardiologist yesterday. My blood pressure has been elevated lately and so they have added another blood pressure medicine for me to start - I just picked it up and will start tomorrow - Losartan  - 25 mg (and I am already on Metoprolol) and I&#39;m taking an antibiotic for a procedure I had done on Friday

                                                I had a severe case of Covid-19 in December of 2020 and was hospitalized for twenty days. The day after the vaccine I got swelling in my left leg which was severe and painful. Testing revealed that there were blood clots in my legs. I have been having problems with bold clots since having Covid-19. My blood Sugar was over 500 the day after the shot and my blood pressure was very high. My blood sugar has been under control for a long time, and it is never this high. I also started to get headaches daily which I am still getting but they are not as often. I now only get headaches two to three times a week especially toward the end of the work week. Before the vaccine I was getting the occasional headache, but they were controlled with Excedrin. The new headaches are only controlled with prescription medication. The swelling in my left leg is still happening on occasion. I had been experiencing Long Covid-19 symptoms before the vaccine but they were much improved and the vaccine seemed to cause all of the symptoms to regress.

I was given new blood pressure medicine when I visited my doctor. The headaches continued intermittently for two weeks and then they came back. Three weeks after the vaccine I had muscle contractions with the headaches from the base of my neck up to my head. I was also getting cramps in my legs. I went to the ER and they said I was extremely dehydrated, so they gave me an IV. I was given a muscle relaxant. The muscle contractions subsided in two days. I developed a big red spot which my doctor identified as a  Hematoma a week later where the IV was inserted. About two days later I developed a big red blotch on my stomach which looked like the spot on my arm.  My doctor said she thought it was a yeast infection on my stomach. I have also been having weird stomach pains in the last couple of days which started as spasms before but now it feels like my stomach is on fire. The headaches cleared up  after four weeks but they are better now.  ER

She presented to the ER today, June 12 2021, and was found to have a right calf DVT as well as multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli.  Her ER visit today also shows newly diagnosed metastatic lesions in the liver and a colonic mass.  It is not clear if any of the thromboembolic disease is secondary to the Covid vaccine at all, or all related to the new metastatic disease.  Decision was made to report this event due to her reported timing of symptoms and patient request to report as well.  She is being transferred to Medical Center for hospitalization and treatment.

                                                On April 20th I got an extreme headache that would not go away. I went to the ER and got migraine medicines, but it still did not help. I went to my family doctor no less than 6 times over the next 2 weeks. After a couple days I started having eye disturbances. Not double vision, but halos and problems focusing. My head still hurt. On  May 3rd I went back to the ER because my left arm was numb. I thought maybe it was a heart attack. Still had the eye disturbances and headache also. They did a CT with contrast at the hospital and confirmed that I had had a stroke. On May 10th I saw a neurologist that ordered an indepth MRI and he found a brain aneurysm.

Patient states that she almost died in the hospital.  Upon questioning, the only difference in diet or medication was that the patient reported receiving the J&amp;J covid vaccine a few days prior to being hospitalized.  Patient reports that she has a history of a blood disorder and transfusions.  Patient reports that nobody asked her about this prior to being given the vaccine.  Patient also reports upon questioning that nobody in the hospital asked her if she received a covid vaccine.

Pain and tingling in my arms. In addition a few weeks into it pain in my inner thighs and strange bruising patterns down my thighs, and tingling legs. severe  bladder pain, and constant feeling  that I need to go to bathroom (bladder infection was ruled out). Pain is usually much worse at night. Sleep has become very difficult. Throat issues to a degree that I constantly have to clear my throat before I&#39;m able to talk  Massages, acupuncture helps, also tried PT for jaw area. IV immunity drips (does not help) Saw 2 general practitioners, one osteopath, one gynecologist, and dentist.  There are days which are better and then days where I can&#39;t work and need to cancel my patients.

                                                I woke up the day after my vaccine feeling slightly nauseous and with chills, which I expected. However, by 8:00 am I had a headache equal to the worst migraine I&#39;ve ever had. I laid in bed all day trying not to move as any movement caused intense nausea. At times, I felt that my heart was fluttering or irregular.  I vomited 3 times, but despite having eaten dinner the night before, I seemed to have nothing to throw up. I vomited clear liquid, if anything at all, which had a strong metallic taste. The vomiting was very intense, leaving me sweating and exhausted.  I fell asleep around 8:00 pm, and when my husband woke me at 9:15 to check on me, I could tell that the sharpness and intensity of the headache was gone. I still had a headache, but it was a normal headache. Today, the 10th, I woke up feeling mostly normal, just weak.

                                                Fever, muscle aches, extreme back pain, nausea.  Fever lasted one day;  muscle aches &amp; back pain lasted 3 days.  Nausea lasted 3 days, but indigestion lasted 5 days.  On day two I went for a short walk and it felt like there was a brick on my chest...I could breathe ok, but heavy feeling in my back and chest.   I walked on day 3 with no issues.  I also developed 4-5  hives on my stomach on day three which were gone on day 4. I took tylenol for the fever and aches after talking with the nurse at my doctors office. After speaking with a few female friends who had the same vaccine, they experienced similar side effects, however their husbands who received the same shot had no issues.  I am wondering if the shot is affecting women differently.

                                                Left upper arm, shoulder and neck became very achy. I began to experience chills without a fever around 8:00 pm. Around 11:00pm, I began to feel nauseous. I wasn&#39;t able to sleep, my heart was racing. By 3:30 am I had vomited at least 5 times. Throughout the day on Monday, I was still very cold, nauseous (without vomiting) and somewhat lightheaded. It is now Tuesday and my stomach is still upset. I have not contacted my physician at this time. I have been treating myself with ginger ale, Pepto Bismol, saltines and rest. I&#39;m not 100%, but feeling much better.

After instructing pt to sit in the post vaccine chair for 15 minutes I noticed visible distress at around 12:50pm. I rushed to her aid and asked her how she was feeling and she reported feeling dizzy. I then helped her out of her chair onto the floor to ensure she would not fall and hit her head - told her to lay supine. I then asked my technician to give me the bp monitor. I then checked her bp and it was below 80/60. I informed her this could be contributing to her dizziness and then asked for consent to help raise her bp. She consented and then I told her I would be lifting her legs in the air to raise her BP. I held her legs in the air for 10 minutes or so and then reassessed her BP and it was 110/48. She started to feel better but reported feeling as if ants were all over her left arm which is where I gave her the vaccine. I assessed once again for angioedema, anaphylaxis, hives, redness, swelling, but didnt see anything. Since the pt was dizzy I did not offer her benadryl liquid but instead offered clairitin. The pt was merely having a panic attack post immunization and said she could swallow tablets and was feeling better. I gave her one clairitn tablet otc. She wanted to sit up so I assisted her to a sitting position while she was on the floor. She sat there for additional ten minutes then moved into a chair and was brought food by her husband because he said she did not have breakfast and thought that could be why she was dizzy. She was not a diabetic so I was not concerned about her BG. She said that this never happened in the past when I reviewed her PCQF form prior to giving her the vaccine. She has had zero history of syncope so this was rare for her. After an additional 10 minutes she had a bp reading of 98/60 and left the store feeling much better

Woke at 12:20 am with high temperature, severe shakes, extreme weakness and inability to walk without assistance due to shaking and weakness. Had extreme body aches and full blown migraine. Was too weak to call for help. Had Advil in nightstand and took several to help. Called doctor in the morning and was advised to rotate Advil and Tylenol. Was too weak to get out of bed all next day (Friday) and half of Saturday. Also experienced tightness in chest to where I had to start taking Albuterol (haven&#39;t taken that in years). Bad side effects and extreme weakness and total loss of energy lasted 3 days.  Persistent headache and tightness in chest lasted up to 7 days.. Horrible experience. I felt like I was poisoned.

Felt fine until Wednesday then broke out in hives and later that day fainted. Still to this day I am breaking out almost every day and I think it is tied to heat. Met with doctor today and she put me on steroid to try to calm down the break outs and then re-evaluate.

I was having some blood when blowing my nose  and remember seeing some small, hard balls which I now realize were clots. I did not go to the doctor because my back was very bad and  I was in a lot of pain and  I had an upcoming appointment with my doctor. I believe that the symptoms resolved after 2 or 3 days and I did not even mention it to my doctor when I saw him.  I felt  a lot of pain in my leg, but this is probably due to my ongoing  sciatica/radiculopathy /bursitis problems that I experience.

I proceeded to have blood and blood clots come out my urethra very urgently. I had abdominal pain and pressure. I proceeded to need to urinate blood and blood clots for approximately 4 hours urgently. I could not go far from the bathroom without having to return quickly to the toilet. I wet myself several times. The clots stopped coming around 1:30 PM. I proceeded to have to have no control over urination urge and could not leave the bathroom. Around approximately 2:00 PM I could leave the bathroom without fear of wetting myself. I continued to have a small amount of a mix of blood and normal urine passing for another hour or so. I have a picture of the blood and clots that came out of my urethra. I continue to have dull pain and pressure in my abdomen.

I went to get cool wet papertowels and upon returning she was unresponsive. I immediately had staff call for an ambulance. Patient came to before needing to administer the epipen or diphenhydramine. Patient denied throat swelling or pain and was alert x3. EMS checked her out and determined it was just a fainting episode, which the patient admitted to having frequently in the healthcare setting. Patient was able to walk out of the pharmacy and is feeling fine now.

I checked her about 5 mins later, sitting still but her eyes were closed and her phone was on the floor.  I went out and asked her how are you feeling?   she said, she is a bit dizzy and I always have a very low BP.  i do have sometime get dizzy... I asked her whether she wanted to lay on the floor.  She said yes.   She was alert and answered all my questions; she did not want any Eip Pen or Meds.  Her BP at the time was 80-50.  Then, She said I am feeling better now and wanted to get up.  I told her we should have the EMT and have a doctor to check her out.  So, EMT came and carried her out.  About 1 hour later, she called me and she was released from EMT and going home.

She continued to breath and was not cyanotic. After 3-5 minutes she regained consciousness. She reported that she had experienced this before with injections. I had her remain in the pharmacy for an additional 30 minutes and checked her blood pressure twice. The second BP check was at 2:05pm and her BP was 108/68. The patient left the pharmacy at 2:05pm.

                                                My sister experienced 18 days later a stroke after receiving her J&amp;J vaccine.  She was at the hospital for two weeks and was then discharged on 06-13-2021 to go home.  At the hospital they performed extensive lab work and medical imaging and nuclear medicine study as well. Then on 06-13-2021 she went back to the hospital due to thrombosis in her right leg. My sister is at home now and is receiving physical therapy at this time. My sister can not walk at this time and is taking medications. The doctors at the hospital stated she is doing very well from the stroke and the hemorrhage has stopped and is almost 100% and at this time her right leg is still in pain due to the thrombosis and is bed ridden.

                                                On May 13th, I felt my feet go numb and I could not stand. I sat down to immediately find a heat go through my bod - heat to head. I then felt my heart racing. Took my pulse and it was 134. (I have had no heart issues at all previously - normal resting heart rate in the 60s). Three more times this happened, with heat going from feet to head (numbness in feet).  Each heart rate was progressively lower with each incidence.  Then it stopped. This was in the afternoon and by evening felt ok.   The 14th, the same thing happened but only 3 times and with hr incidents starting at 123.  Then fine again.  The morning of the 15th started again, so I went to urgent care appointment in the afternoon. By this time, my heart rate was up and down..  They ran an EKG and it was fine, just showing rapid heart rate. But I was sent to the ER for further tests.  At  ER another EKG, chest x-ray and blood work.  Only item of significance was an elevated TSH.  At this point, my heart rate was going up and down (I had a finger monitor so I could watch it).  I&#39;ll note at this point, the heart rate was random but I was able to walk. Over the next week or so, hr got worse and positional. When I stood up, it would sky rocket to the 140s.  I became shaky, developed brain fog, nausea, feeling like I was going to fall over and felt only well laying down or sitting.  I visited my primary who initially thought anxiety but as symptoms were getting worse (I could no longer do anything: walk farther than from the living room to the kitchen, do simple tasks while standing or sitting - hr would increase while doing activities even while sitting, and no longer drive).My doctor decided it was more than anxiety when I was continuing to have symptoms that looked like POTS. I have been to the cardiologist - she  did a 24 holter and EKG - no significance, but decided my heart was not the primary cause of the positional heart rate increase.  I am due for an echocardiogram this week - just to make sure but she did not think that was the issue. An MRI this week, recommended by my neurologist. and have done preliminary blood work/urinalysis for possible endocrine issues - all that have come back normal so far (but seeing an endocrinologist next month anyway).  I currently am seeing functional neurologist who has diagnosed me with dysautonomia  (so far of unknown reasons) - he is helping me with the heart rate issue (POTS) and other symptoms that have developed over the weeks like electrical zaps throughout my body - some sort of neruopathy. I was in great health until this shot.  I had not even had a cold since January of 2020.  I may have hypothyroidism but it has been managed with some ups and downs in TSH for the last 20 years with no other issues.   Some of my doctors do not correlate the shot to my problem but some have.  There does not seem to be any other explanation.

By around 8:45 had a temp of 99.2 aching, chills, and very hot feverish, and then began experiencing fast heart rate and feeling like I was going to pass out or vomit, wave of nausea and broke out in a cold sweat, chest tightness.  I had taken two 500 mg acetaminophen tablets from 8:45 to 9:30 p.m.  My heart rate would not slow down so 911 was called and I was taken the ER.  I was given IV fluids and Toradol.  Blood work was done and EKG showing sinus tachycardia.  After receiving the IV fluids and Toradol, felt better and was released.

                                                I had awful nausea, loud ringing in the ears, I fainted.  The medics provided help, gave me oxygen.  I started having convulsions.   After some time I felt like the lower part of my face went numb and it took tremendous effort to move my lips to talk.  At that point, the medical called the ambulance and sent me to ER, where I was under supervision for some time. I was very weak and nauseated. After I was released, I was very weak could not keep the vertical position.  The next day I was very nauseated, with awful tinnitus, lightheadedness, and weakness. Staying vertical for more than 15 minutes brought fainting symptoms.  I was not able to get out of the house to work.  The next day the fainting symptoms disappeared, everything else continued. Too weak to go to work.  I started moving about only on the 4th day after the shot.  During this event, I did not have any fever or muscle ache, no virus0tyle symptoms.

                                                Upon injection, medication burned going into arm and lasted about 2 minutes.  I immediately started feeling odd over my entire body, I felt and looked flush,  felt clammy, muscle tightness,  started shaking, felt very nauseated, blood pressure went up and experienced slight swelling in hands.  This lasted 30-45 minutes.  My blood pressure, oxygen saturation level were being monitored.  I left office at around 12:00 pm feeling better.  I felt off the entire day.  At 6:00pm I started with chills, muscles aches and pains.  At 7:30pm I took a shower and went to bed very fatigued, muscles pain and cramping and chills. I took my daily meds of 125mg of Diamox, and 100 mg of Azathioprine.  At 11:30pm I woke up with a 104 fever, sweating, and a lot of muscle cramping in legs and feet.  My head felt like it was going to explode.  My cerebral fluid pressure was up and felt in head and down spin.  I did not rest well and found it difficult to get comfortable all night.  I took an 200 mg of ibuprofen at 12:00am and started to feel some relief.

                                                Three waves of discomfort... felt like ice water was poured inside of my body.  Extreme  weaknesses of arms/legs.  Visual issues.  First wave within 60 seconds of shot (ended up on floor - embarrassing!).  Second, and most severe, wave about 10 minutes later while sitting in chair.  Apparently, I passed out with my eyes open.  Hubby got nurse.  They said I was unresponsive.  Nurse checked blood pressure and heart rate after second wave - both normal.  Third wave, much less severe, hit after 10 more minutes.  Ice water/weakness feeling in arms and legs and not so much in chest area.  Nurse speculated it could be low blood sugar (based on medications).  Have never had low blood sugar event previously AND had eaten about an hour prior to vaccination.  However, drank 4 ounces of orange juice, just in case.  Went home about 20 minutes later... no other significant side effects.  No swelling/redness at injection site.  No other illnesses, etc.

I slept all afternoon; felt tired. When I got ready to go the bed, my heart felt like it was racing some. Around 2:00 am my heart was really pounding - my watch was going off and telling me that it was at 130 to 150. The highest was 152. I called my doctor&#39;s after hours phone number. I took my blood pressure - it wasn&#39;t that elevated but it was the racing heartbeat. About 03:30, I went back to sleep. It was about 100 for about next  12-18 hours. It seems to be back to normal now.

I visited Dr. and he has ordered tests to check on my heart. I told him I was concerned about the &#34;pause&#34; and the reason for pause because I feel pretty miserable, and he added a CT test that will be done in two to three weeks. I do not know if he will report my symptoms as possibly vaccine related.

But around 6pm,  I was sitting outside on a cool night with a jacket and scarf on and I suddenly very very hot and  had to take off my layers. I felt nauseous. I got up to go inside because I thought I would throw up and then fainted.  I came to a second later (some friends where with me) and felt extremely nauseous. My friends brought me a bucket and I got sick. I felt immediately better. But later that night I had a headache, and chills. I didn&#39;t get sick again, but I left as if I had the flu.  I felt better in the morning.

At that point, my bad symptoms started. I was up all night.  1. I had nausea and I threw up. I had body aches and no energy to move. 3. About an hour later, my heart started &#34;racing&#34; really bad. I felt like I was running a marathon, and I couldn&#39;t keep up with the pace. I could hardly catch up my breath.  4. Then, my right arm started tingling and feel heavy. I couldn&#39;t feel any of my &#34;fingers&#34; on my right hand.  5. My body kept going from extremely hot to extremely cold. I felt like my blood pressure was up and down. I had more nausea. I could barely move. 6. I threw up again and, eventualy, I slept.

After 4 days of that I got a really super heavy period with cramping and blood clots in my menustral flow.  It was a horrible period, while the one after the surgery in Feb was very light.  Dizzy and fatique  10 days after shot on the April 8 I took a fall from a chair outside, and from Thrusday to the Saturday  10th I ended up in the Emergency room with a concussion and head symptoms including dizziness and nose bleeds.  This was from a simple fall, and i suspect the covid shot might have caused complications after the fall with additional swelling and brusing.

She then presented to the hospital 4/16/21 and was found to have a deep vein thrombosis in her left brachial vein as well as a thrombosis in her right internal jugular vein. She is currently being further worked up and will be admitted to the hospital for anticoagulation.

This was followed by dysarthria and facial droop. The symptoms persisted until the following day at which point she went to urgent care and then here to our ER. We did a head CT which showed she has and acute/subacute stroke in the right posterior MCA territory. I am the Hospitalist physician that admitted her yesterday. I have and MRI of the brain as well as an MRA and MRV ordered though not performed yet. Her symptoms are improving.

                                                BLOOD CLOT IN LEFT THIGH; SWELLING; FATIGUE; This spontaneous report received from a consumer concerned a 55 year old female. Initial information received on 13-APR-2021, processed along with information received via telephone communication on 15-APR-2021 The patient&#39;s weight was 100 pounds, and height was 152.4 centimeters. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included progressive multiple sclerosis, swelling of the left leg and foot, and non smoker, and other pre-existing medical conditions included the patient had no known drug allergies. the patient was not a pregnant at the time of reporting. The patient had no family history of thrombosis, no prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1808609, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 total, administered on 22-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included baclofen, escitalopram oxalate, and risedronate sodium (received 2 doses and stopped after the event).  The patient&#39;s husband reported that in MAR-2021, the patient had symptoms of fatigue.  On 23-MAR-2021, the patient had swelling and fatigue.  Her fatigue was resolved on 24-MAR-2021 and swelling was resolving.  On 05-APR-2021, the patient developed left thigh swelling. On 06-APR-2021, the patient&#39;s swelling was not going down and she visited her primary care physician. The physician could not determine the cause of swelling (left thigh very noticeable clot swollen around where clot was located) and the physician suspected clot and performed an AD dimer (fibrin degradation) test to look for potential blood clotting. The patient also had a venous duplex ultrasound that showed left leg clot.  At 19:00 on the same day, the patient&#39;s physician advised to visit emergency room and determined there was a clot on left thigh and she was prescribed Eliquis Starter Pack (apixaban) for 3 months treatment and recommended another scan in several months. On 06-APR-2021, the patient&#39;s vitals were reported as blood pressure 124/70 mmHg, heart rate 88 bpm and oxygen saturation of 99%. Laboratory data included prothrombin time (PT) 13.4 sec , International normalized ratio (INR) 1.2 and  activated partial thromboplastin time  (APTT) 34.8 sec. (Normal range not reported for all) d-dimer and platelet count results were not available and Covid-19 test was not performed. Body max index was 19.5 kg/m2. On an unspecified date the patient was feeling better but had not recovered from the event. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from fatigue on 24-MAR-2021, had not recovered from blood clot in left thigh, and recovering from swelling. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This case concerns a 55-year- old female subject, immobile due to progressive multiple sclerosis who developed a left thigh swelling 12 days after Janssen COVID-19 vaccine was administered intramuscularly for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included body max index of 19.5 kg/m2, progressive multiple sclerosis and swelling of the left leg and foot. She is a non-smoker, no known drug allergies, no family history of thrombosis, or prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Symptoms started with swelling of the left thigh and fatigue. The fatigue resolved the next day. The patient&#39;s swelling in the left thigh was not going down and she visited her primary care physician who checked her D-dimer dimer (level not known to patient) and scheduled a venous duplex ultrasound that showed a clot in the left thigh.  Her vital signs were blood pressure of  124/70 mmHg, heart rate 88 bpm and oxygen saturation of 99%. and she was prescribed Eliquis Starter Pack (apixaban) for 3 months treatment and recommended another scan in several months. Laboratory data included PT 13.4 sec, INR 1.2 and APTT 34.8 sec. D-dimer and platelet count results were not available and Covid-19 test was not performed. The patient is feeling better but had not recovered from blood clot in the left thigh, and is recovering from the swelling. Given underlying progressive multiple sclerosis with immobility and preexisting swelling of the left leg and foot on the same lower extremity, the clotting of the left thigh is considered not related to Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. Additional information has been requested.

                                                6 days after shot I got a debilitating headache (the worst headache of my life 10/10 pain).  I went to the ER and they proceeded to do a CT scan and blood work.  Nothing abnormal was found.   The next day I went to Hospital ER due to the head pain, shortness of breath, chest pain and high blood pressure.  They put me on steriods and pain meds and I was referred to a Cardiologist and neurologist.  4 days later I was in the ER again for head pain, my BP was 220/125 due to pain when entering the hospital.  After about 2 weeks, I saw  a neurologist.  He prescribed various pain meds including anti- seizure meds and shots.  The cardiologist feels that it is not a heart issue.   I remain having  daily headaches 6 weeks later but the intensity is lower (5/10).  My BP is now back at a normal level.  I am awaiting 2 more tests.  MRV and spinal puncture test.

                                                4/5/2021--Received Janssen vaccine.  Felt very hot during the day.   4/6/2021--Woke up with very bad headache and rash on the injected arm plus on my stomach.  Went for a walk and felt pain in my left calf and achilles tendon.  Went to work.  4/7/2021--Started my work day as a Personal Trainer/Fitness Instructor at 6am as usual.  Taught cycling classes and trained a few clients.  Went for walk.  Still had a headache.  When I got in my car to head home, my vision was super blurry and I felt very dizzy.  I ate an orange and peanuts and hydrated more.  I was not even sure I could drive home.  I got home told my family how I was feeling.  My husband noticed my eyes were very red and swollen.  I took a shower, drank a smoothie and ate a salad.  Used my aunt&#39;s BP cuff to check my BP and it was 148/99.  I have NEVER had HBP.    4/8/21--Woke up feeling disoriented as if the left side of my face, body were off--neurological stuff.  I went to reach for grapes in the refrigerator and could not grab them.  I felt like I have never felt before and ask my husband to drive me to the ER.  While at the waiting room at the ER, I felt chest tightness and pain and nauseous.  My BP was 153/111.  Again, I have never been diagnosed or been treated for hypertension.  They did EKG, lab tests, chest X-ray.  Once my BP came down, they sent me home.   This is before all the JJ Janssen vaccine &#34;news&#34; came out and the reasons it was paused.  I developed a very bad cough about two hours after I got home from the ER.  4/9/11--Made appointment with a brand new primary care doctor.  Saw her on Monday 4/12/2021 as recommended by ER.  I had never met her before.  She prescribed a very low dose of BP medication, which I did not take because the number one side-effect is dry-cough.  I was already coughing a lot, later on with blood.  4/11/2021--Still feeling pretty bad, I woke up to the news of the Janssen vaccine being paused.  Frankly, I felt relieved that I was not going crazy.  This truly has been one of the hardest things I have ever gone (and still am) going through.  I became concerned about the pain in the left calf and heel could be a clot.   Called primary care doctor.  Had ultrasound of legs and chest x-ray the following day   4/12/2021--Had persistent cough with blood.  Went to ER at 9pm.  Had EKG, blood work, CT without contrast of chest, covid test--negative.  Got home around 2am.  4/19/21--Followed up with primary care doctor who after explaining to her I am extremely fatigued, still blurry vision, dizzy, cough better but not gone, chest discomfort on the left side, she referred me to an ophtamologist and cardiologist.  My insurance and this poorly established referral system is very difficult to navigate.  Up to now I am still waiting for the referral and pre-aurhtorization to the opthtamologist.  (4/23/2021).  I want to say, I am pretty healthy. I have worked in fitness and wellness for over 30 years. I have never drank alcohol, smoked or done any drugs.  Prior to this no physician has told me I have HBP or any issues for which I have to be medicated.  I take zero medications.  Even when I had the bad headache from the vaccine I took nothing.  I have not worked in two weeks and had not driven until last saturday.  If I don&#39;t work, I don&#39;t get paid.   I pay for almost $600/month for my insurance in the marketplace.  This has been another stressor of this storm.  Getting providers to really listen and insurance companies to take situations like this seriously.   I could not drive at night.  This has been rough and I look forward to being myself soon.  This reaction felt like a heart attack/stroke with extreme fatigue, acid reflux, cough with some blood, muscular pain.  The rash and headaches were the least of my concerns.  I am not yet recovered from all of this.  I sure hope there is no permanent damage and that this too shall pass.  It is important to note that I have tried reporting this event several times to the VAERS website online.  I completed the 4-5 pages multiple times and it would not let me submit.  I also called the VAERS 1-800 number to report and they told me to go back to the online form.  I left several messages when I could not get it done online and to this date no one has called me back.  I called to report my adverse reaction and they told me they do not take that info.  I also called the health dept.  After several phone calls to them a nurse called me back but did not take a formal report.  When someone is feeling pretty sick, this is a lot to ask of.  I persisted because I feel this is important to be reported.

                                                immediate symptoms - bowel movements are very different and continue to this day. Like babies poop. Specific date of occurrence 3/24/2021 - 2 pm: was standing in my home office feeling just fine and then my heart started racing and I was immediately nauseous to the point I had to lay on the floor on my back and tell myself to breathe.  I felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest, so I got up and grabbed my wrist blood pressure monitor and went and lay back on the floor telling myself to breathe. I took the first reading and it said 200/52/57  so I too it again 199 / 50 / 58.  I started to panic and remembered I had bought some cans of oxygen for my father and had one in the bathroom. I went and breathed on that for about 2 minutes. My reading then went back down to a more normal range. Since that time my head doesn&#39;t feel the same and it scared me enough to tell my husband and mom, yet they both told me not to stress about it. I have only experienced ongoing bowel movements and the weird head feeling since that time but did contact my Dr. for an appointment. I want be certain I didn&#39;t have a stroke or something peculiar.   I had noticed my heart rate increasing but wasn&#39;t sure if I was imagining it, so I restarted taking my blood pressure numbers on 3/22. My blood pressure that morning at 6 am was 113/59/72.

                                                No immediate reaction day of vaccination. By evening had an increase in mast cell symptoms including, dizziness, nausea, severe headache, stomach pain, mild chest pain, fluish feeling, very fatigued.  Also severe left leg pain in calf (not a normal mast cell symptom for me). Symptoms still very prevalent by April 13, leg pain was worse, now in both legs. Saw primary physician Dr. He saw no swelling in legs and no treatment done at this time. April 18th headaches and leg pain was so severe went to ER. They ran a D Dimer test to test for blood clots and it was normal. Spoke with my mast cell specialist, Dr. by phone on April 19th and he prescribed 40 mg Prednisone daily for 5 days. Started prednisone on April 24th. When treatment course was finished my mast cell symptoms came back even worse than before, Had throat swelling, in addition to above symptoms. Went to Urgent Care on May 2nd, and they prescribed 60 mg Prednisone for 5 days. After this course of treatment, same thing happened,symptoms returned. Dr. suggested I follow up with my primary physician to make sure there wasn&#39;t something else going on besides mast cell symptoms. Dr. ran blood tests on May 14th,  including another D Dimer which was negative. Since tests were normal Dr. prescribed a long term taper of Prednisone which I am currently on as of June 9, 2021. Saw Dr on June 1st for follow up. Continuing prednisone taper for an additional 3 weeks. Symptoms as of June 9, 2021-still very sick. I still can&#39;t eat foods I was eating prior to vaccination, worsening of mast cell symptoms and leg pain is now mild and intermittent which is better. Still have headaches but they are not as severe as they were.

                                                The next day after vaccine, about 4:00pm - pain hit me and it was so severe I started to throw up from the pain. Short term memory/brain fog has been an issue. I&#39;ve had massive migraines. Complete body aches - even my bones hurt. The worse one was on  both of my arms  - above the wrist - and it was horrible (mostly on the right). One big blur of pain - I&#39;m in a lot of pain all the time. I have a constant headache. I keep losing consciousness and that started after the vaccine. It use to hit every three hours. Now it&#39;s more than that.  I have been two ERs in the couple of weeks. I&#39;ve been to the doctor, too. I am referred to a neurologist - can&#39;t get me in until middle of July. I pass out and when I wake up from it I am in excruciating pain - my whole body hurts. I can only take Tylenol because I&#39;m on Warfarin. I use Tylenol as needed and ice pack and heating pad for the pain. I started to almost lose consciousness when I have been completing this but I&#39;m okay - it is like a blanking out of the moment.

Heart palpitations mostly when lying down.  Felt like it was skipping a beat.  That was intermittent and last less than a minute at a time.  Has calmed significantly.   3.  I had routine bloodwork done 11 days after vaccine and my cholesterol had jumped from in the 130-140 range to 193.  Retested in June and it is back down to 156.  Went to doctor on April 23, 2021 as routine not a result of any symptoms.  Went to Cardiologist on June 8 because I was concerned about the palpitations (did not feel life threatening but wanted it checked out) and the increase in the cholesterol

                                                HORRIBLE experience!!!  Felt faint the second the shot went into my arm, and for about 20 minutes afterwards.  (I practice meditation, and I can assure you this was NOT a panic attack or based on nervousness).  Felt heat in my neck and ears, and immediate arm pain.  After 30 minutes, drove home, and felt &#34;spacey&#34; the entire ride home.  Ate some breakfast to see if that would help.  Within 3 hours, I was getting a high fever, muscle aches (EVERYTHING hurt...including the tops of my hands...absoltuely miserable!!), fatigue, dizziness.  THE WORST SIDE EFFECT WAS HEART PALPITATIONS.  MY HEART WAS BEATING OUT OF MY CHEST (ELEVATED BETWEEN 90-120 BPM) FOR A STRAIGHT 36-HOURS!!!!!  HOW COULD THIS BE NORMAL?????  I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE.  I WORK OUT EVERY DAY...SO MY HEART RATE IS NORMALLY MUCH LOWER...SO THIS WAS EXTREME FOR ME.  It took FOUR DAYS for all of my symptoms to subside.  FOUR DAYS!!!!!  This vaccine is NOT safe, despite what you are telling the general public.  I am an extremely healthy person...I eat healthy (no processed foods), do not drink or do drugs, meditate daily...this was an extreme reaction.  Then, about 5 days later, news broke that the CDC was halting distribution of J&#43;J due to blood clots.  For two weeks, I developed severe anxiety, thinking that I would be a blood clot victim.  Next to my breast cancer experience, this was the WORST health experience I&#39;ve had in my entire lifetime.  I WOULD NEVER GET ANOTHER VACCINE AGAIN!!!

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included ethyl alcohol abuse, and concurrent conditions included hypertension. The patient had no known drug allergies. The patient had no known other illness at the time of vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient had not taken any prescriptions, over the counter medications, dietary supplements or herbal remedies at the time of vaccination. The patient had no adverse event following any previous vaccine. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, and batch number: 206A21A expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 total  administered on 21-APR-2021 on left arm for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 08-MAY-2021, the patient&#39;s laboratory data included CT (computed tomography) angiography of chest showed severe burden of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) with severe right heart strain, small early infarct posteromedial left lower lobe (LLL), hepatic steatosis and interventional radiology (IR) thrombectomy procedure showed large bilateral pulmonary emboli. On 09-MAY-2021 (approximately 3 weeks after vaccination), the patient was presented to the emergency room due to progressively worsening shortness of breath. The patient also had pain and swelling in the left calf and leg. On the same day, the patient experienced brain injury, brain oedema, acute kidney injury, hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, mental impairment, pain in extremity, peripheral swelling and had lung assist device therapy. The patient was hospitalized on an unspecified date. On 10-MAY-2021, the patient&#39;s ultrasound venous Doppler showed complete thrombosis left femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, peroneal and anterior tibial veins, partial thrombosis of left common femoral vein. The patient underwent urgent thrombectomy, however, on 11-MAY-2021 (the next morning), she became more hypoxic and hypotensive and was intubated and was urgently placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The patient developed multi-organ failure and was started on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for oliguric renal failure. On 13-MAY-2021, CT computerised tomogram (CT) scan of the patient&#39;s head showed diffuse cerebral edema, which was most likely a result of hypoxic encephalopathy. With no improvement in her mental status over the course of the next few days, the patient was taken off life support and died on 15-MAY-2021 due to unknown cause. The patient was in hospital for 7 days. It was unknown if autopsy was performed. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient died of death, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, brain injury, brain oedema, acute kidney injury, mental impairment, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, hypoxia, dyspnoea, pain in extremity, peripheral swelling, hepatic steatosis, hypotension, right ventricular dysfunction, continuous haemodiafiltration, endotracheal intubation, thrombectomy, lung assist device therapy, withdrawal of life support, angiogram pulmonary abnormal, computerised tomogram head abnormal and ultrasound doppler abnormal on 15-MAY-2021. This report was serious (Death, and Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged). This case, involving the same patient is linked to 20210542597.  Additional information was received from patient on 01-JUN-2021. The following information was updated and incorporated in to the case narrative: Patient demographics (race, ethnic origin), added patient history, added ethyl alcohol abuse in disease tab, added batch number, added facility type and other identification numbers updated.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V1: This spontaneous report received from a health care professional via Regulatory Authority VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System), concerns a 55 year old female patient, who was noted to experience acute pulmonary embolism (PE), with severe right heart strain, 18 days after receiving the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. The patient sought consult at the emergency room due to worsening of the shortness of breath. The patient also had pain and swelling in the left calf and leg. Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) of chest showed acute pulmonary embolism (PE) with severe right heart strain, small early infarct posteromedial left lower lobe (LLL), hepatic steatosis. Venous doppler showed complete thrombosis left femoral, popliteal, posterior tibial, peroneal and anterior tibial veins, partial thrombosis of left common femoral vein. The patient underwent urgent thrombectomy. However, she became more hypoxic and hypotensive, was intubated and was urgently placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Later, she developed multi-organ failure and was started on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for renal failure. Nineteen (19) days after receiving the vaccine, Computerised tomogram (CT) scan of the patient&#39;s head showed diffuse cerebral edema, which was most likely a result of hypoxic encephalopathy. With no improvement in her mental status, life support was said to be taken off which resulted to death. It was unknown if autopsy was performed. Patient&#39;s height and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included ethyl alcohol abuse and concurrent conditions included hypertension. The patient had no known drug allergies.  The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Information is limited in this case. However, a relationship with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine cannot be ruled out and the relationship is considered indeterminate. Additional information has been requested.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: UNKNOWN CAUSE OF DEATH

Then my blood pressure went up and my heart started beating faster. I had tightness in my chest and I got a tickle like feeling at the top of my chest. I got nauseous. BP was elevated (140/85) normal 107/65.  I stayed for an hour. I was very very sleepy the whole time.  3/5/21 I still have the tickle and tightness and pressure on my chest and I am having vertigo attacks. I got a headache and pain and stiffness in my neck where I have had nerve pain injections and ablations.

                                                The patient was screened and was found to have multiple medical allergies but no allergies to any of the components to the Janssen vaccine.  As a precaution, the nurses advised a 30 minute observation.  She received the vaccine without complication and then was being observed and they called me over and the paramedics were also with the patient.  About 17 minutes into observation, the patient started developing chest pressure (4/10), lightheadedness, and nausea.  No shortness of breath, stridor, diaphoresis, back pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, neurologic changes, and any signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis.  She was very anxious.  Further history revealed that the patient had been discharged from the hospital 6 week prior.  She initially went in for an abdominal laproscopic surgery and woke up to having 32 staples closing an abdominal incision.  They had to change from a laproscopic approach to an open abdomen approach due to complications.  She ended up with sepsis and a colostomy and was hospitalized for 2 weeks getting antibiotics.  She lives by herself and was overwhelmed before coming into the clinic for her vaccine.   The paramedics did a 12-lead ECG that showed sinus rhythm.  Vital signs and blood glucose were within normal limits.  The paramedics recommended that she go to the hospital to be checked out but she was very resistant and was tearful because she was traumatized from her previous hospitalization.  After some time, the paramedics convinced her to go to the hospital.  The paramedics hung around the emergency department and then came back once they found out that she was fine.

Day three - Tired after walking the dog, napped and then tightness/ache in chest/lung area which continued throughout the night. I could not lie on my side or it would trigger the ache in my chest. I could breathe deeply but that also triggered the tightness. Day four (Monday) - Chest ache continued. Contacted doctor&#39;s office. Took a Tylenol that seemed to help a little and watching my blood pressure.

                                                8 hours after injection started having severe lower back and leg pain. Then came the horrible headache causing nausea and dizziness which ultimately resulted in causing me to pass out while attempting to get to the couch. Once I came to the body trembles  started accompanied by being freezing cold. The headache and diarrhea lasted into the next day with symptoms not lessening until day 3. Still have to take Tylenol every 4 hours to keep headache manageable.  I did not seek medical treatment but would strongly warn those getting this shot of the possible  loss of consciousness. It came on very fast, 8 hours after the injection,  and could be deadly if someone was driving or not near soft surroundings.

Then last night I slept 9 straight hours but woke up  sweating a couple times in night and in morning woke up sweating but my aches and headache seemed better than the day before so I went downstairs to make tea.  After pouring a glass of orange juice and having a couple sips I started to feel strange --dizzy and oversome with a strange feeling that was not quite like the feeling before fainting -- my back had a weird pain and i was a little nauseous as well. ..it was more overwhelming -- more loss of control like a huge wave of dizziness and ringing.  I made my way to a couch to try to regain balance -- but was still very dizzy-- something happened to make me try to get up and go upstairs so I remember walking 12 feet or so then told myself to sit down.  Before that happened I must have blacked out.  I faintly remember moving myself across the floor but then must have blacked out again.  I woke up at the base of the stairwell and then was able to walk upstairs.    I had collapsed the first time onto a hard floor as my orange juice glass had spilled all over and when I got upstairs my sweatshirt was covered in juice.  I don&#39;t remember any of that.  Once upstairs I drank water and have been fine since then.  I had eaten dinner the night before but maybe it was the sweating in the night that dehydrated me and i cramped up and had a strange pain in my back---i don&#39;t know.  I am a very healthy 56 yr old woman 5&#39;3&#34; 105 lbs so maybe the Johnson and JOhnson one dose was a lot for my body or maybe my body was just doing what it&#39;s supposed to do to react to vaccine.... i also may have had asymptomatic covid in the last year so my body was overreacting.   This happened 7 hours ago and I seem fine aside from slight headache and continued weakness from vaccine but I thought I should report the incident in case there might be something more or in case others had similiar responses.

                                                Became Lightheaded within 5 min of injection, progressed to severe dizziness, black spots in my eyes, could hardly lift my arms,  progressed further to nausea, was given zofran on tongue by EMS, progressed to severe vomiting.  EMS took blood pressure it was 93/50 hear rate was very low. Called ambulance and advised I go to hospital immediately.  Blood pressured jumped to 150 then dropped again.  Once in ambulance they put IV in and gave Zofran through IV, I don&#39;t know if they put anything else in there.  Blood pressure stabilized around 110 which is normal for me, I normally have low blood pressure and heart rate.  Nausea and dizziness dissipated by the time I got to hospital.  They put EKG on also while I was in ambulance and said I was having PVC&#39;s advised dr to do another EKG once I got to hospital.  Felt better by about 5:00 PM.  Overnight I had slight fever and body aches, took Advil and symptoms subsided.  Slight soreness in arm and armpit, but not major.  Have been feeling fine now other than being traumatized by the whole event.

I am suffering from a sleep disorder. I felt exhausted, bigger and longer headaches, joint pain, muscle pain. My Blood pressure went up. I visited my family doctor today.

I had a severe reaction - chest pain and back pain for the entire day.  I alerted Drs., but I&#39;m sure it should be reported.  I took my ZyrtecD prior to vaccine, which I&#39;m sure helped in some manner.  I was better on Friday with lingering back pain.  Today I am down with bad headache and stomach pain, but I am aware there is a current stomach bug.

I felt a weird sensation near my heart that was only momentarily - like a bubble or something about 1/4 inch in length move through a vein near my heart - I think I felt it again near my stomach a few days later - weird.  and then my face felt like I was losing sensation - like it was tingling .  that lasted a little longer, like a sagging.  I thought maybe I put on weight.  i was concerned and went to pharmacy to get my blood pressure taken - which I have never done in my life.  I am 56!  They no longer do that bc of COVID - so I asked a nurse friend to take it. She measured 124 over 60 something.  that is high for me.  I am typically 106/62.  I checked my records.  I started running then - in case I have put on weight.  I am 155 (high).  But now I started getting a constant headache about a week ago.  I am in a new job - so have thought it was due to stress or I reactivated a concussion  headache.   i started taking  Ecotrim 2 everyday now.  I am NOT an aspirin taker and I do not get headaches.  I try not to take ibuprofen for the headache.  I am not sleeping.  I have slept well ALL my life up to now.  I go to bed late now like 11;30 and I don&#39;t sleep.  I have a lot on my mind.  so it could be that.  Under a lot of stress.  this just started the last week.  A very new pattern.  I started a new job 3/15/21.  I was drinking coffee for the first 2 -3 weeks and now am not drinking it.  I don&#39;t drink much alcohol but I have had 1 glass of wine on the weekend or beer.   I run about 3 miles 2-3 times a week.

Day 4, I inexplicably dozed off for a split second while driving.

If I did anything (shower or carry a simple laundry basket) my arms would hurt so bad, I was out of breath and my heart was pounding so hard.  By the week of March 29th - I was laying down in the middle of the day, no energy at all.  Called the doctor and because of the shortness of breath &amp; Body aches, they would only schedule a video visit for Monday, April 5th.  After talking to me, they schedule to see me that day at 11:45 AM.  I had weak muscle response in my arms, pale, and out of breath.  They did blood work.  Two hours after getting home; they called and said I needed to get to the emergency room.  My red blood cell count was dangerously low, and they ordered a blood transfusion.  I sent 6 days in the hospital.

T his is not just a few spots but heavy and noticeable by others.   Then Saturday night 04/17/2021 I dozed off on the sofa but woke to an incredible headache with jaw and neck pain.  I had dysphagia.  Earlier in the week I had two bad headaches but dismissed them as work.

                                                At approximately 2AM on Thursday, a severe headache (I would term a migraine based on prior experience) woke me. I had no apparent fever, but my body was stiff and I felt my heart rate was elevated. I drank some water, in case it was dehydration-related, but was unable to fall back asleep. I also experienced some nausea at breakfast but ate toast and had some (caffeinated) tea about 6 AM. Around 7 AM I took two (2) ibuprofen, which dulled the headache slightly. However it persisted into early/late afternoon hours on Thursday. (My customary activities were curtailed somewhat.) Since I have had migraines in the past, I treated this as I treated those: hydrating, taking pain medication as required, remaining quiet, reducing exposure to light and sound, etc. I continued taking two (2) ibuprofen periodically as I felt the need through bedtime Thursday night.  Friday I had periodic headaches (again, attributed them to rebound migraines or just headaches), felt tired, and been a bit &#39;out of it&#39;. But my systems did not prevent me from functioning. I did repeat the two (2) ibuprofen on Friday night at bedtime.

It lasted 36 hours and then I felt my Vestibular Migraines. I was dizzier than usual. Under my left armpit was very painful reaching toward my left breast. The area of the shot was not painful. I also had dizziness chest pains under my right clavicle immediately after I got the shot. The chest pain went away for three days and then it came back.  It was like an extreme muscle ache. It was a dull and intermittent pain. I was referred to a Respiratory clinic and I still had a low grade fever.  My left arm was stiff two weeks before the shot and  three days after the shot my  left shoulder was frozen. I had an appointment with my Orthopedist and she confirmed an encapsulated shoulder problem.  At present after three weeks my shoulder is still frozen and my armpit is still a little painful. The chest pains are less frequent.

                                                Two weeks after receiving the vaccine my legs started swelling. I went to my PCP and he measured my legs and sent me to hospital because he said that it looked like I had blood clots. While in the ER, they started performing tests, and they found a DVT in the left leg and to PE&#39;s, one on each lung. I was under observation because I was given Lovonex to thin my blood. While in the hospital the swelling started to go down and that is when I was discharged. I am now seeing a vein specialist and a pulmonary doctor. I was given Eloquis 5mg 2x per day. I am still having pain and swelling in both legs, but the leg with the DVT is worse. It is very hard to walk around because my left leg will swell a lot.

About six weeks ago my blood pressure was a little elevated and I had chest discomfort. I took the medication OTC - Prevised - 14 day regiment - which I was told to do for when my blood pressure acts up and it seems to have helped. I am feeling a little better so I&#39;m hoping it was just my Reflux that was acting up.

I had a bad headache, ringing in my ears so I went to the ER. They put me on the Amlodipine medication. My BP was still going up. My headache and ringing on my ears would not go away. I called my cardiologist to increase the Metoprolol medication. Then he added Spironolactone daily for me to take and my blood pressure came down to 120/70. I was then referred to a kidney and hypertension doctor and he has decreased the Amlodipine and so far, my BP is still stable.

June 7th - severe leg cramping - both calves in the back for about five days. June 21, 02:00 am, I woke up and it felt like something was sitting on my chest and I couldn&#39;t get a regular breath or deep breath. I sought medical treatment at 07:00 - my partner took me to ER - got there at 07:30.  They gave me tests to check for blood clots and heart attack. Kept me for a few hours to re-do the Troponin test to check for blood clots a second time. 6/22 and 6/23 - continued to have shortness of breath. 6/23 - saw doctor for follow up and he ran a COVID test - negative result. I&#39;m continuing to have intermittent shortness of breath and unless it gets worse I&#39;m just managing it. My doctor said to wait it out. No treatment. I am not able to do the long hikes that I like. But I&#39;m managing fine and can do daily things I need to do.

I also had a cough. I laid around for 2 days, I was aching, after those 2 days I was okay. But everything started happening again in April. I have medications for my cough. My body is stiff, and it&#39;s a little hard for me to walk. I have headaches, and I can barely eat. I have problems sleeping now. I also have a pain in my leg, and numbness in my right hand. Irritated eyes, and chest pains/ tightness, and these symptoms have been coming and going since April. I&#39;ve tried to take tylenol for my pains. Patient stated that has not seen a doctor for reaction.

After 4 hours the fever subsided as quickly as it came on and my heart returned to normal functioning. When the fever subsided I was left with a severe headache for approximately 6 hours. Once the headache subsided I felt lethargic and foggy headed. On the second night (3/14/2021) the fever returned but was only 100.4 degrees. I took an Aleve before going to bed and when I woke up this morning I felt back to normal.

                                                At about 23 minutes broke out in a cold sweat. At 26 minutes, became hoarse (always my first symptom of anaphylaxis). Progressed to coughing and feeling a lump in my throat and then tightness in my chest. My blood pressure elevated to 152/100. At that point I self administered epi pen and paramedics called 911. This provided relief but after about 5 to 10 minutes the tightness in my chest and the feeling I couldn?t get a deep breath began to return and the paramedics administered two puffs of an albuteral inhaler and transported me to the hospital. At the ER, they did an EKG, started an IV and administered fluids, prednisone and Benadryl. I was discharged about 90 -120 minutes later with a prescription for 3 days of prednisone (50mg) and instructions to continue to take 25 mg oral Benadryl every 4 hours.  The next morning my face and chest were red and looked like I was sunburned. My face was also swollen.

                                                Received injection on Sunday. Monday was nauseated and had chest pressure.  Nausea and CP came in waves and occurred about 10 times. Then stopped.   Felt &#34;off&#34; for 4 days.  Felt fine on Friday and through Wed 3/23/21 until 9:10 PM.  Developed visual changes in left peripheral bilat.  Appeared like waves in an arc.  Then began to not be able to breathe.  I had to tell myself to breathe.  Called squad, arrived 9:45pm.  BP 170/110, HR 118. By 10pm, the visual changes disappeared BUT developed chest pressure in same area as the MOnday after the vaccine.  Then became extremely nauseated, almost vomiting.  Nause came in waves for next 6 hours until it calmed down.  Then returned Wed am for several hours, again in waves along with hollow chest feeling and pain. Continued with headache off and on with brain fog the remainder of Wednseday 3/23/21.  Discussed with hospitalist at Hospital and was told to report it to the CDC as likely an adverse effect to the vaccine.  Was still in the 14 day window.     Thank you,  RN, PhD, MSN, MS, BSN

My husband suggested I take Theraflu Nighttime for the pain and to sleep, which I took. Around 4:42 AM, I woke up to use the restroom. I was drenched so I guess I sweated out a fever. Went back to bed. My husband woke me up and suggested I drink some water. I went to the restroom, still feeling out of it, then made my way to a chair where I sat and down and collapsed. According to my husband he tried several times to revive me and finally I began gasp for air. The paramedics arrived and I was taken to Medical Center.

After about 5-6 minutes in the car, I started to feel bad, and I felt I should pull over.  I was on the road and traffic was super busy. I did pass out in front of a store on the road while driving my car. I came too and saw a restaurant. I pulled into their parking lot and texted my husband to come and get me. When he got there, I could barely stand. I layed down in the back of his truck because I could not sit up. My arm went number but I could wiggle my fingers.  We did drive to the hospital because I was so weak. but after the 15 minute drive to get to the hospital, I was able to sit up and walk again. I did not want to pay the $500 deductible so I my husband drove me home where I am sitting on the couch resting now.  My husband is a Chiropractor, so he has a lot of medical background.

Patients breathing was fine, but she was extremely lethargic/limp. Was coherent but slow to answer questions, excessively sweating and pale, small amount of vomit. At one point, patient said that she did not know where she was. Said that her fingers felt numb and tingly (could not pick up water or orange juice...we had to put water and juice to her lips to drink). She said that she needed to lay down. Per patient she had oatmeal with very little sugar for breakfast and coffee. Believe the reaction was a vasovagal response.

My heart rate was 95-100 beats a minute laying in bed. When I went to the restroom my heart went up to 112 beats per minute. I took a baby aspirin, ate some chicken soup, and went back to bed around 6:30am. I slept soundly for 5 hours. My husband looked at my heart rate on his phone (connected to his smart watch) while I was sleeping. He says the rate was usually around 60 beats a minute while I was asleep. My heart rate has seemed normal since then.

                                                My issues initially started about an hour after the vaccine.  I became very subdued, no appetite and &#34;foggy&#34; for a lack of better words.  I attributed this to what others stated were &#34;typical reactions&#34; and did not make a fuss over it.   The following day I was VERY tired and stayed in bed and then about half way thru day 3, I became alert and resumed normal activity.  At day 13 I began to have upper thigh pain in my left leg and began to feel winded as I was would walk up steps and do housework which had not happened previously ever..  On 4/14/21 I requested an appointment with my primary care doctor, however he was booked for 2 weeks and I was referred to an associated PA  where I received a virtual consult.  He told me that I was &#34;over the age&#34; of the women that were having reactions ,even though I had requested a Doppler.  He only ran bloodwork, and in fact never even called me back on the bloodwork, and just posted it in the online profile.  My ankles are VERY swollen and have bluish pitting and my feet do have considerable pain.  I do have right side abdominal pain everyday since the 13th of April.  I now need to find a doctor that will run diagnostics and respect my concerns

I was taken to the ER and kept there approx. 5 hours.  I was extremely weak, could not lift my head and had trouble forming thoughts and words.  They gave me medication via IV&#39;s and observed me.  I started to feel better after about 4 hours after the vaccine, but have had more headaches than usual after receiving it.  I still have some issues with being upset and anxious about the reaction and if it will have long term adverse effects on me.  I will never get another vaccine of any type again.

The next day I had stinging pain in my right side and the bottom of the right foot.  My heart raced and skipped beats and felt like it was flopping.  The oxygen deprived feeling  continued for 5 days. The hammer like pains subsided. I continued to feel nauseous and exhausted for 2 weeks after vaccination. The third week I was just very tired. It was such an terrible experience, I didn?t think I would live through it.

And then a few days later, my oxygen started dropping down to the 70s and my body temp dropped to 95.1- I was passing out at home, although I didnt realize that is what was happening, I would just wake up and an hour would have passed and I didnt even realized I was out, and this kept happening especially during the time that my temperature kept dropping below 95. I rushed to the emergancy room which after I had been there a long time- they found that I had a  *************** *********BLOOD CLOT- MASSIVE********************** A SADDLE BLOOD CLOT ************** IN  LUNGS They immediately admitted me, and immediately started me on Lovonox and Coumidin I am currently on oygen and I will have to take Coumidin for the rest of my life. Due to the size of the clot (5-6 inches) they were concerned about my heart, the clot caused a strained on the right side of my heart, so they put my on a different beta blocker Coreg to slow my heart rate down, I will also have to take this medication for the rest of my life

That evening I was watching television, covered with a blanket, and my nose got very cold and tingly. I felt like I was breathing cold air. That did resolve later that evening. The next day I was really fatigued and felt dizzy. I felt this way all day. Later that day I started itching. My head, legs and arms were itching. At 11PM that night I called the Hospital and spoke with a nurse to see what I could take for the itching. I was told that since it was after 24 hours from the injection, I was able to take Benadryl. I had to take it every day for the week. I continued to have fatigue and dizziness for 2 days after receiving the vaccine. My psoriasis was healing and had almost gone away, but 2 days after the injection I had a flare. I stayed in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis stayed in a flare until around 05/12/2021. I had to receive several steroid injections and B12 injections to calm everything down.

                                                Arm pain the first week. Then on the eighth day, I had twitching (whole body) like I was having a seizure but it wasn&#39;t. It only happens when I lay down. Then I had a headache, maybe a little that first week after, but when the twitching the headache got worse. When the twitching was severe it was every couple of minutes. The headache could be associated with other problems. I wasn&#39;t sleeping. The headache gets worse at night time. If I lay on the left side where the headache is on it gets way worse. Then my hip hurts if I lay on other side because I had hip replacement. My blood pressure got so high, went up to 212/110. I went by ambulance to ER. At one point, 240 over 110 (the ambulance guy told me it got up that high). But then at hospital it was back down to 212/110. I had been taking my blood pressure was not going down and that&#39;s why I called. I got to the hospital and they took all types of tests and blood and x-ray of my chest. Then they gave me one shot in the IV of Ativan. That helped a lot. It stopped the twitching for 24 hours. But now the twitching is back but it&#39;s less often. The next day after the hospital I slept all day and didn&#39;t twitch. Just last night I couldn&#39;t sleep at all. Not just the twitching but I was just restless. I have a headache today, too, and have been in bed all day. I&#39;m trying to stay calm because I don&#39;t want the blood pressure to go up. No new meds after the hospital. I still feel pretty bad and will see my doctor on Monday follow up. I&#39;m nervous to take blood pressure reading, trying not to take it.

                                                For background - I have ITP -and have to get my blood drawn usually weekly and platelets were down the middle of March - saw an oncologist - take me off blood thinners and increase the Prolacta.  Sometimes platelets go up and down for no reason. I went in to get a steroid injection in knee for knee pain on May 18th. I had one three months earlier in my other knee with no problems at all. Before I got the injection, my blood pressure was really high - they told me to watch it. Which is very abnormal for me - usually it&#39;s low and very stable. First time in the history of my life that my blood pressure was ever like that. When they gave me the steroid injection - I got a pounding headache the next couple of days. It was the worst pain I&#39;d ever had. It was a headache I have never had before. That Sunday, I went in to the Urgent Care because I couldn&#39;t take the pain anymore. The doctor sent me home to wait for bloodwork results. Got results on Monday, 24th.  My platelet count was through the roof - 700,000 PLUS. I would have had blood clots if I wouldn&#39;t have been on Blood thinners. I would have had a blood clot on the brain. They have never been that high. This was with no medication change - just had had the vaccine and the injection. I called my oncologist on the 24th after that and they had me go to go to ER. They took me off Prolacta and put me on blood thinners. They were having me get my bloodwork at least twice a week and it took about three weeks for platelets to go back down. Now they are low. The headache has stopped. Have spoken just on the phone with my primary care doctor. I feel like this had to do with the combination of the vaccine and the steroid injection.

                                                Before receiving her first dose of the one-dose series, pt stated that she always &#34;faints or passes out&#34; with IM injections/vaccines - in an attempt to prepare for this, another pharmacist assisted during the time of vaccination, and the patient did well. We sat with the patient for about 5 minutes and asked that she stay seated for the remainder of her &#34;15 minute wait period.&#34; She was accompanied by her husband. Roughly 10 minutes after administration, one of our technicians alerted the pharmacists that the patient had experienced vasovagal syncope, so we rushed to the patient, called 911, and remained with her until she woke up (which was within less than 1 minute after the event) and was in the care of other healthcare personnel.

By 6:30 pm I was achy all over and my legs were aching a lot. When I went to bed around 8:00, I hurt all over (achy and flu-like feeling, but no fever). I dozed off and on and about midnight when I woke up, I had a very rapid heartbeat. This went on all night and into the morning. It was hard to get any sleep at all. When I&#39;d get up to go to the bathroom, I was slightly dizzy and unsteady on my feet. After I got up at 6:30 am, the highest my heartrate got was 113, then it finally began going down. I was still hurting all over, felt extremely tired, and now had fever - 99.8. The fever lasted off and on all day and into the next night. I was also very nauseated all day and I felt extremely bloated. I also had a bad headache. When I woke up on Friday, my fever and the headache was gone, but I felt extremely tired and weak and still nauseated. I slept most of the day and I still ached all over, but not as much. My lymph nodes were also swollen. On Friday afternoon, I walked up to the mailbox and I was winded and unsteady. On Saturday, I felt a little better, but was still extremely tired. By Saturday night, all the aches, pains and headache were back and I didn&#39;t sleep well at all. I rested most of Sunday and felt a little better Sunday evening. The aches and pains were going away, but I was still very tired and exhausted. I felt the same way when I woke up on Monday morning. It seemed like the vaccination made the aches and pains I normally had with Fibromyalgia about three times as bad as usual. And I was still very bloated feeling all over. By Monday afternoon the nausea finally went away. By Monday afternoon I was feeling a little better, but still tired. On Tuesday I felt better still and I noticed that I wasn&#39;t bloated as much. It seemed like I was getting back to normal.

                                                My left arm started to sting immediately after getting the shot, then the stinging subsided.  My left arm started to hurt later in the day and I had pain all the way down my left arm and left side of my chest. This pain throughout my left side was not helped by Ibuprofen and  made sleep very hard.  I had intermittent sharp pain in my neck, shoulder, and left arm for days.  The injection site turned red, hot, and a raised area the size of a silver dollar appeared  and was med-red in color for about 8 days.  The color is better/ almost normal as of today, but still a hard lump under the skin and a bit itchy.  This has caused pain throughout my back and shoulders since I got the shot....but it has not been activity limiting.  I had a slight bit of nausea for a couple of days as well.  My husband had his shot just after mine and experienced  Chills , headache, and nausea at about 9:00 P.M.  His chills subsided at about 3:00 A.M.  He continued with the headache for another day/ fatigue for 2 days/ and nausea for about 5 days.  He has also had tingling in his left arm (about 7 days)  and a funny tingling on his tongue for about a week.

                                                Prior to receiving her COVID-19 vaccine, the patient was already having symptoms from anxiety/nervousness about the vaccine. Patient was given her injection and within 1-2 minutes, she began feeling dizzy and lightheaded. The vaccine administrator came to me (pharmacist on duty) to notify me that she was not feeling well. I went to go check on her and she stated that she felt as though she was going to faint. I advised her to stay seated, asked if she would like an ice pack and water, and stepped out to get those for her while remaining vigilant (because I wanted to be in the same room as her for observation/safety). I brought her the ice pack, she held it on her chest and head and said it felt nice. After about a minute I stepped out again to ask a technician to get a water for her. When I came back, the patient was still seated but had a blank stare and her mouth was slightly open. I repeated her name out loud and nudged her shoulder several times, however the patient was unresponsive completely. I immediately looked for the red emergency kit in the consultation room but did not see one (I later found out that there was an EpiPen on the table in the room, but I did not see it at the time due to the urgency of the situation). I rushed back into the pharmacy, told the technicians to call 911, and took an EpiPen off the shelf in the pharmacy. I ran back into the room and the patient&#39;s face was very red, her eyes were bulging slightly, and it looked like she was trying to reach her hand up or move it, but was unable to. I injected her with the EpiPen immediately, and within roughly 5 seconds she came back to consciousness and looked at me and said &#34;I&#39;m sorry&#34;. EMS arrived extremely fast and was there a few minutes after using the EpiPen. She was then taken by ambulance to the hospital. Patient had a friend, with her at the store who was scheduled to receive the vaccine as well, but after the incident she decided otherwise. Later that evening I gave patient&#39;s friend a phone call to check and see how patient was doing, and to also let her know that patient&#39;s vaccination card was at the pharmacy if she wanted to pick it up. That evening around 6:30-7pm, patient&#39;s husband came to the pharmacy to get her card, he updated us that she was being discharged from the hospital and that she was okay.

                                                I had body chills starting within 7 hours of the vaccine.  I developed a headache, nausea, slightly dizziness about 14 hours after the vaccine.  About 15 hours after the vaccine, I still had the headache, nausea,  dizzy,  and additional slight diarrhea, dry heaves, rapid heartbeat, and feeling very tired  and weak but went from chills to hot and sweating.   This lasted for about an hour and then it was back to body chills, headache, nausea, body fatigue for the next 24 hours.   My arm and injection site did not hurt, only if I would rub across that area of my arm.   I have still experienced the fatigue 60 hours after the vaccine.  Nausea has still come on different time during this time too.

                                                Sharp pain in the posterior left upper back (under the shoulder blade) which started around 10 pm with great intensity lasted through the intense general body aches around Thursday night but still persists today but with less intensity.  It feels like discomfort in my upper left chest which radiates to the front chest at times.  Some shortness of breath but not severe, noticeable but not terribly uncomfortable. This continues to the present.

                                                On 23 March 2021 I received the Janssen Covid-19 Vaccine LOT #1805025. I contacted Johnson &amp; Johnson via phone to report that I was experiencing an intense, deep pain in my upper left thigh and a headache about two hours after receiving the Janssen vaccine. Case #ICSR Information : 20210346108 JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE SECURE! The pain in my thigh worsened whenever I stood or sat still. I inquired if thrombosis is a side effect or something that I need to be concerned about. The woman on the phone said she looked up thrombosis, but did not see it listed. I asked if I should start taking aspirin. The woman on the phone said that she could not give me medical advice. I was so concerned that I took a full aspirin about every four hours for twelve hours on that day and a full aspirin for about three days thereafter and two baby aspirin ever since. The pain in my thigh diminished by 26 March 2021, but ended a few days later. The headache occurred intermittently. I have had some chest discomfort since then, but it hasn&#39;t risen to the level of angina. I am still concerned about thrombosis because of the intensity of the pain.

Sore arm, bruised. Monday evening 04/12/21 felt sick, nauseous. Unusual for me. Continuing to feel sick each day since then and called in sick to work today. When I move around I feel worse. My chest feels like I am on the verge of getting really sick. I can breathe but just do not feel good. Feel worse when having a conversation with people. Feel better resting. I have no fever. My blood pressure and heart rate are normal. This is the sickest I have felt since before the pandemic. I called a nurses hotline yesterday and was told to call 911 is I had chest discomfort. I do not feel sick enough to call 911 and could drive myself if I need to go to the hospital. Best way to describe my symptoms is feel like I am on the verge of getting a bad chest cold. Had a headache last night and did not take anything. Woke up in the middle of the night with a very painful headache and took 2 Tylenol which made the headache subside. I have been feeling worse each day since Monday. Today is Thursday. Am wondering if I have COVID-19 and have called a clinic to schedule a COVID test that will be paid for by my work. Am waiting for a return call. All I know is that I feel sick and was not feeling this way before having the vaccine.

He checked pt&#39;s pulse and reported it to be weak and thready. He reported her O2 sat was 83%, but her hands were ice cold. Pt was still answering out questions at this point with no breathing difficulties. PA reported O2 sat back up to 93%. Pt&#39;s BP 122/62, HR 100 and RR 20.  EMS paramedics arrived in 5 mins. Pt A&amp;O x3 with paramedics and refused transport to local hospital ER for further evaluation and treatment. Paramedics confirmed pt was AMA. Our nurse dialed pt&#39;s husband on her cell phone.

I continued to check on pt until her husband arrived. Pt remained A&amp;O x3 with NAD.

On 03-APR-2021, she was going up one flight of stairs, and felt severely short of breath and had dry cough. On 4-APR-2021, she experienced pain between shoulder blades in back. Oxygen saturation at home was 93-94% on RA while resting. On 4-APR-2021, she went to emergency room at a computerized tomogram (CT) of chest with contrast around at 6:30 PM showed massive pulmonary embolism. The right chamber the heart was enlarged due to the blockage from the embolism. Blood levels for &#34;stress on heart&#34; came back high. The patient went to cath lab for pulmonary angiogram on 4-APR-2021 and had EKOS catheter direct thrombolysis. She was started on heparin and transitioned to Xarelto (rivaroxaban) on 5-APR-2021.  She was on blood thinners and the left lung was cleaned up and removed. The clot was still on the right lung, unable may or may not be cleared. The patient was discharged on 06-APR-2021. The patient was hospitalized for 2 days. On 04-APR-2021, Platelet count was 181 (normal range 140-440), on 5-APR-2021, Platelet count was 160 (normal range 140-440), on 6-APR-2021 Platelet count was 154 (normal range 140-440). At the time of this massive PE event, the patient was not on any anticoagulation and since the event, had been restarted on Xarelto, and she was told she needs to continue for life. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from pulmonary embolism, and the outcome of feeling achy, chills, fever and slight cough was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Life Threatening).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: A 57-year-old woman with a history of Factor V Leiden deficiency (off anticoagulation for several months) and previous DVT 10 years ago was hospitalized for pulmonary embolism four days after vaccine. The same day after vaccine, the patient reported chills and a 102 F fever. Two days after vaccine she experienced shortness of the breath and four days after vaccine, the shortness of breath became worsened with pain in the back between the shoulder blades. The patient went to the hospital and was diagnosed with massive pulmonary embolism with enlargement of the right side of the heart. She underwent direct catheter thrombolysis in the cath lab and was started on Xarelto. The patient was hospitalized for 2 days and is doing well. Although there is a close temporal relationship, the history of Factor V Leiden with previous DVT provides plausible alternate explanation for the event.

That evening around 4:00 pm it was still seeping so I went back to the ER. They didn?t want to do anything with it because they had it almost stopped. It stopped the next day. Packing stayed in all weekend until Monday morning when I returned to the ER to have it removed as per instruction. I followed up with Dr.  that Thursday and he cauterized two spots in my nostril.

I woke up with a swollen juggler vein that ended up being a blood clot, 10 days later my arm was swollen up twice the size of my leg, the juggler was still swollen. I call the urgent care nurse they said to go to ER. I went to hospital got a CAT scan and ultrasound, I was given a shot of warfarin that was supposed to last for 12 hours. I went home and the next morning instead of going to the hospital, I went to hospital and they found 2 blood clots in brain, arm and leg and neck. I have had no history of blood clots and this all happened after the J&amp;J vaccine. They did a procedure where they tried to put a balloon to relieve the pressure. The blood clots in the brain cannot be removed because of their location and it would be dangerous to remove and I am on blood thinners for the rest of my life. Multiple blood clots in body brain, arm and shoulder.

                                                I previously reported that 8 hours post vaccination I had severe teeth-chattering chills, severe muscles spasms throughout my body and aching of every joint.  That stopped after 5 hours at which time I felt like I was on fire from the inside.  Several hours that later and I developed a headache, nausea and diarrhea.  I took my temperature upon arising and it was 100.3.  I was fatigued.  The headache then diminished by 24 hours post vaccination.  I continued with abdominal upset, bloating, loose bowels, fatigue and fluctuating fever for 9 more days.  On day 17 post vaccination, I had a medical appointment at which time my BP was taken.  Because I always had good BP, I do not monitor it between medical visits.  It was 178/96.  I had never had high BP.  I always ran 120/80 or below.  I bought a BP cuff and checked it again later that day after resting.  The BP increased that evening to 188/101.  I made an appointment with my PCP the next day.  At that time, my BP was 188/110.

                                                April  14, my sister was transported to hospital feeling faint and numbness in her left leg. As a result, she was admitted and treated for: ? blood pressure readings as low as 82/43, 76/50 while standing ? blood clots on her heart that traveled to her brain that were causing multiple mini strokes ? 95% blockage in her right heart vessel which required a stent  ? 50% and 60% blockage in other chambers that will require attention She was given heparin and then switched to a different blood thinner to dissolve the clots.  she was discharged on April 23rd with instructions to followup with her cardiologist and neurologist.

CT-PE showing submassive saddle pulmonary embolism with several large emboli in bilateral upper and lower pulmonary arteries.  Transferred from outside hospital to another Hospital.  Started on IV Heparin  infusion with transition to Enoxaparin.  Had significant drop in platelet count and developed peripheral thrombi in all extremities.  Concerned for HIT at that time, and review of CDC recommendations for COVID vaccine-associated thrombi, patient transitioned to Fondaparinux and remains on at present.

Initial information was received on 27-APR-2021, with additional information obtained via telephone follow up from the physician on 29-APR-2021. The patient&#39;s specific height and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included fatty liver, and the patient was overweight.  Family history was significant for a deep venous thrombosis treated with anticoagulants in the patient&#39;s mother, and a history of unspecified blood clots in her maternal grandmother. The patient was on no medications, including no estrogen containing pharmaceutical products or supplements. She has never been exposed to heparin. The patient had no history of COVID-19 infection. The patient received COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S (suspension for injection, route of administration not reported, batch number not reported) on 12-APR-2021. The batch number has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported. On 18-APR-2021, 6 days after receiving vaccine, the patient developed a headache. On 23-APR-2021, 11 days after receiving vaccine, the patient presented to the hospital with complaints of headache and abdominal pain. COVID test in the emergency room was negative. On 23-APR-2021, imaging of the head and abdomen revealed:  left sigmoid sinus vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, splenic vein thrombosis, superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, left internal jugular vein thrombosis.  The patient also had thrombocytopenia, with platelet count on presentation 22,000 (units not provided).  D-dimer was elevated at &gt;12.8 (units not provided), Fibrinogen was low at 103 (units not provided), HIT antibody test by ELISA was positive, and physicians made the diagnosis of Vaccine-induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT). The patient was hospitalized in the intensive care unit. Treatment medications included argatroban, steroids and IVIG.  Following treatment, the platelet count remained low, with a nadir of 17,000. On 27-Apr-2021, she underwent thrombectomy and thrombolysis of the intra-abdominal clots. This was performed due to the potential for portal hypertension in the future, given the extent of the thromboses. Repeat CT venogram of the head on an unknown date, revealed resolution of the sigmoid sinus vein thrombosis; the internal jugular thrombosis persisted. The patient has steadily improved since the thrombectomy. Abdominal pain and headache are improving.  Platelet count has steadily risen, to 138,000 on 29- Apr-2021. Her transaminases were slightly elevated on admission and have not worsened, and she appears to have no organ dysfunction. A dialysis catheter had been placed in the event she would require plasmapheresis, but this was never used.  Additional laboratory data included: IgG and IgM antibodies against the SARS-COVID-2 nucleocapsid protein positive; Protein C deficiency negative; Protein S deficiency negative; Homocysteine level (NR: not provided) negative.  Serotonin release assay, anticardiolipin panel and Factor V Leiden tests were pending. The plan was to transition the patient to an oral anticoagulant and remove the dialysis catheter on 30-APR-2021, with a possible discharge on 01-MAY-2021. The patient had not recovered from left sigmoid sinus vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, splenic vein thrombosis, superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, and left internal jugular vein thrombosis, and was recovering from left sigmoid sinus vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, headache and abdominal pain.  This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Life Threatening).  Additional information was received from physician on 29-APR-2021. The following information was updated and incorporated into the case narrative: patient history, disease course, events, outcome, lab data, concomitant drugs.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This spontaneous report concerns a 58-year-old female patient who experienced left sigmoid sinus vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, splenic vein thrombosis, superior mesenteric vein thrombosis, left internal jugular vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, headache and abdominal pain, 11 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S.  The patient is overweight and there is a family history of clots in her mother and maternal grandmother. Imaging of the head and abdomen revealed multiple sites of thrombus formation, platelet count was 22,000, D-dimer was elevated at &gt;12.8 (units not provided), Fibrinogen was low at 103 (units not provided),  and HIT antibody test by ELISA was positive. Physicians made the diagnosis of  Vaccine-induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT).  The patient was treated with argatroban, IVIG, and steroids.  Platelet counts remained low and she underwent thrombectomy of the intra-abdominal thrombi.  Following thrombectomy the platelet counts rose and abdominal pain began to improve.  Lab data included a positive test for IgG and IgM antibodies against the SARS-COVID-2 nucleocapsid protein.   Based on the evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS, per definition from Brighton Collaboration), the low platelet count and temporal relationship to vaccination, we consider the events to have a plausible relationship with vaccination.

                                                At 12:30PM, I started getting a migraine, nauseated, and fatigued.  By 1:15PM, I was having a  hypertensive crisis.  I went to my doctor&#39;s office with a  blood pressure of 191/109.  I was administered an EKG, which came out abnormal.  I was prescribed new blood pressure medication and sent home.  My blood pressure continued to spike out of control, and I had chest pains, shortness of breath and nausea.  I went back to my doctor on the 15th and had another abnormal EKG.  She sent referred me to a cardiologist, who I saw on the 16th.  She prescribed new blood pressure medication.  I made an appointment for additional testing, but ended up hospitalized on the 23rd when my symptoms worsened.

                                                I experienced the following day, I started getting very bad chest tightening and felt like spasms. I was not sure if I was having a heart attack, like a gripping pain in my chest, lasted for 1-2 hours. In the meantime, I did go to the ER because I thought I was having a heart attack.  EKG and x-ray of the chest was performed, lab work was also performed. My BP went way up as well and I felt very nervous. I also saw a cardiologist for the chest tightening sensation.  I think that the J&amp;J vaccine I received was related to my symptoms.  I can say today I sometime experience chest tightness but very lightly and at this time I have no symptoms.   I do not have my lot# at this time to provide.

Still occasionally have some pressure on intermittant days and with less severity than original pains. I have not yet sought out medical opinion to determine if I have incurred any heart damage.

                                                On 04/21/2021, 12 days after I received the vaccine, I woke up with my entire left side feeling numb and I had a headache. I felt like I had pressure on my chest and I was really lightheaded. I got up for a little while and I felt like I was going to faint. I felt like I needed to eat something and I was very weak. I drank some juice and ate an orange. I was having a hard time swallowing and at times slurred my words. I realized that something serious was going on because I had pain like when I went through chemo. The base of my spine has been hurting every day since I received the vaccine and I have had headaches since as well. I was having heart palpitations and felt super weak. I didn&#39;t go to work for 2 days. That was 04/21 and 04/22. On 04/23 I had to do a zoom conference for work, for an hour, and my eyes starting hurting really bad like my eyes had been open for 24 hours. The light from the computer screen was really affecting me. At 5pm I did a tele-video appointment with the NP. She told me that she wanted me to go urgent care because it was the closest urgent care to me. After going to Urgent Care on 04/24, the doctor wanted me to go to the Hospital by ambulance. At the hospital the performed an EKG, CTA and MRA and they said that everything looked fine. They couldn&#39;t validate that my pain was from Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I was release at 10:30pm PT, I called Dr., my Oncology surgeon, and he referred me to Neurology doctor. I got an appointment with Dr., 04/27, and she ordered a CTA and an MRA. I had the scans completed on 04/28, with and without contrast. The radiologist found something. I was sent back home, but I was told that right vertebral artery was completely excluded. In January of 2020, there was a CTA performed, and I didn&#39;t have any numbness and my vertebral artery still have a steady flow even though there was a tear. It also showed that I had more stenosis in my carotid artery. I have now been referred to a new Neurosurgeon. Dr. never saw me because they couldn&#39;t view my records. The doctor told me to take Crestor and 81 mg aspirin. I did not feel that those medications helped at all. If anything, I felt worse. on 05/15, I was in the passenger seat of my grandson&#39;s car and I ended up throwing up and there was blood coming out with the vomit. He took me the Hospital. I had a video appointment on 05/11, with an NP, and she told me to up my aspirin to 325mg and continue to take Crestor. She referred me to The Stroke Neurology Group and she referred me to get a CTA. She also referred me to a GI doctor. On 05/15, against medical advice, and was taken by ambulance to another hospital. I stayed there until 3AM 05/16. They performed an MRA, a CT, Stroke Angiogram, they MRI with and without contrast, a chest x-ray and a lot of blood work. They also performed are lactate test and at first it came back as 2.5, which made them think I had an infection, but they re-tested and it came back as 1.5 which they said to be normal. The results from the hospitals. On 05/19 I went to see a Cardiologist, and she took me off of Crestor and put on pravastatin. She order an echocardiogram and a treadmill test and an EKG. I did see a GI doctor and they told me that the aspirin that I was told to take is what was making me throw up blood. I do have a neurology appointment on 06/11 and I have an appointment with the neurosurgeon on 06/16. My last heart test came back normal.

This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This spontaneous report received from a patient concerned a 58-year-old female who experienced stroke-like symptoms and occluded vertebral artery 15 days after vaccine. Past medical history included vertebral dissection of right vertebral artery in 2000, hiatal hernia, chemotherapy, radiation, vertebral tear, 5 years of cancer drugs and stroke-like symptoms, and concurrent conditions included 2 times breast cancer survivor. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid, and pravastatin. On day 12 after vaccine, the patient woke up with left side stroke-like symptoms. The patient went to emergency room on day 15 and discharged on same day. On day 19, the patient had computed tomography scan and showed occluded right Vertebral artery. The patient had a computed tomography scan one year ago and there was no occlusion. She was discharged and evaluated by stroke neurologist. There is no report of thrombocytopenia to suggest thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome. Given the pre-existing history of vertebral artery dissection, there is a plausible alternative explanation for the event.

                                                Over the course of 10 days following the injection I had fever spikes (up to 102), fatigue, loss of appetite, muscle soreness and joint stiffness (more than normal), chills, sweating, heaviness in chest, diarrhea, I vomitted the day after, but that was just for a period of 4 hours. On the 4th day I woke up with stiffness in my left arm and underarm, and swollen glands. I went to the urgent care on the following morning, but the stiffness and swelling had started to retreat and has since disappeared. Soreness at the injection site for about two weeks after vaccine. It is still a bit tender to the touch, but does not bother me unless rubbed hard. There was also redness and tenderness and some itching at the injection site. I felt poorly enough (the fatigue, mostly), that I was not able to work for 10 days. At about the two week mark I finally had the feeling that I felt good!  I occasionally feel fatigued, but have been able to resume normal activities.

After 45 minutes it began to level down and they sent me home but even before getting to the parking lot I started shaking and I was out of breath. They gave me epinephrine and they called 911. They took me to the hospital, and they told me I have an arrhythmia. They did an EKG. They let me go my home. Since that day my blood pressure has been high and my doctor put me on blood pressure medication. The day before having the vaccine I had a physical done and my blood pressure has been always on the low side but now it is still high. Now I am being treated for new symptoms, which are chest pressure accompanied with shortness of breath and dizziness. The dizziness its scary because sometimes I drive and I feel like a drunk person driving which is not right and not safe.

                                                Patient received Janssen COVID19 vaccine (LOT#1802068) at approximately 12:00 pm on 3/16/21. During the 15 minute observation period, she expressed &#34;I don&#39;t feel good&#34; and endorsed nausea. Shortly thereafter at approximately 12:10 pm, she started to slouch and nearly fainted while sitting in a chair. She did not fall or hit any part of her body. She was easily aroused with a touch on her arm and responded to verbal questions within seconds (less than a minute). She denied trouble breathing or chest pain. She then reported nausea again and was offered a receptacle to vomit in if needed; however, she did not vomit. Patient was encouraged and instructed to sit on the floor to prevent injury in case of fall but she refused stating that she didn&#39;t think she would be able to get back up given her preexisting knee problems. Pharmacy staff offered her water, a fan, and opened windows. Her jacket was removed in order to monitor blood pressure/ pulse, which was not abnormal. Patient did not have any trouble breathing, rash, swelling, abdominal cramps, or mental status changes. She was contacted via phone a few hours later for follow up on the incident, at which time she denied any issues and reported feeling well.

I got up and walked back over to my waiting chair and my Husband got up and received his vaccine.    Besides the pain in my left arm,  I started feeling weird tingling sensations and spaced out.  When my Husband sat back down next to me,  my stomach had a burning sensation and I felt slightly nauseated.  Then I felt like I was about to faint.  My Husband and the Staff kept me from falling, The Staff brought ice packs to put on my neck.  They said I turned white and profusely sweat.   I don&#39;t remember all of it, my Husband filled in the blanks.  I started feeling better and we left @4:30.

I got the vaccine at 9am.  around 4pm that afternoon i started feeling sick.  by 7:30pm I was in bed thinking I was going die!   By midnight, I got up and tried to walk to the stairs but i was to weak to walk.  I could not sleep.  I was up for 36 hours!  I was nauseous, dizzy, weak, exhausted.  Every inch of my body had pain!!!  I was tingling all over.  I  had the chills until midnight.  My heart would race and then stop... then race again... I was having difficulty breathing!  I tried standing up but I couldn&#39;t.  I would have driven myself to the emergency room but I couldn&#39;t walk.  by noon the next day, my heart regulated, I was able to breath easier.  I was still exhausted and full of pain and tingling.  Today, I still have some pain, but no tingling.

                                                Fever - 100.4; body aches; mild headache and fatigue. And then about midweek, I was starting to walk downstairs at work and I had to grab onto rails so I wouldn&#39;t fall - had become so dizzy. I tried to get into my regular doctor -  he was full until April 5. I went into walk-in clinic - I  had to grab onto a board there (dizzy) and they told me to get to ER. My heart was rapid heart beat by time I got to ER. They had to give me wheelchair so I wouldn&#39;t fall over to go into the ER room. Horrible bruising on wrist - because the first IV didn&#39;t take. They gave me a bag of fluids - and gave me Meclizine to help dizziness subside and two Tylenols for headache. I&#39;m taking 3  (per day)- 25 mg chewable HCI Meclizine. If symptoms aren&#39;t as bad I just take a half of one. Still needing the medication because I still have the pressure in the ear comes up and I need to take the Meclizine and Benadryl to get the pressure to go down.

                                                Vaccine administered @ Noon, slight headache right after. Chills began at 10:30 p.m. and non-stop shaking. Able to dose. Awoke at 2:00 a.m. 4/6 with a very rapid heartbeat, feverish and terrible headache. Removed covers and tried to find my thermometer. Almost called 911, but decided to wait to see if it got better. Once covers removed, I cooled down enough to try and find my thermometer again - heart rate still very elevated. Found it and temperature showed to be 101 (not sure of accuracy though).  Took (2) extra-strength Tylenol and drank 16oz of water. At 3:00 a.m. still had very bad headache, but heart slowed down. My arm was a little sore for only 24-hrs, but not any more than when I receive a flu shot.

                                                About 6 hours after receiving the vaccine I started getting a headache and felt chills. I was on my way to a hotel before leaving for a flight the next morning and was driving. When I stopped driving and attempted to exit my car, I experienced dizziness and stroke like symptoms. My legs would not hold me up and I felt as if I would pass out in the road. I held on to the car for several minutes until the feeling abated somewhat. Then I made my way unsteadily into the  hotel building and had to sit down for several minutes. My heart was beating rapidly and I felt strange so I took one of my nitroglycerin and also took an extra 12.5 mg Coreg.  After being taken to my room, I laid on the bed and continued to feel  weak, lightheaded and became very nauseous. I got out my pulse oximeter and my pulse was 95.  I took another Coreg and it seemed to slow it down for a little while but again it started racing and I continued to be nauseous and broke out in sweats and my pulse got back up to 100. I took another nitroglycerin and a baby aspirin in case I was having a heart attack. Then I took another Coreg. My pulse rate finally slowed down. I slept intermittently until going to the airport at 5 a.m.  I still felt weak and nauseous and very tired.

                                                Returned home around 4:30 PM from vaccine and felt a bit tired &amp; not hungry for dinner. Iced my arm and took 2 Tylenol as my head began hurting.  I went to bed at 9:00 PM and woke up around 1:00 AM with an excruciating headache and felt nauseous I took 2 more Tylenol, but could not fall back asleep. I felt very nauseous and was unable to go back to sleep. Oddly, I was sitting up wide awake and for a period of about 30 minutes, I began seeing brightly colored images that looked like they were floating in front of me. It was extremely odd as my eyes were open and I was awake. I finally fell back asleep around 5:30 AM and had horrifying vivid nightmares. When I woke up around 8:00 AM my headache was still there and I felt somewhat nauseous but not as bad as during the night.  My headache continued through the day on Saturday and I continued to take Tylenol about every 6 hours. I attempted to go to bed around 9 PM when I experienced horrible chest pain that radiated through my chest and into the left side of my throat. This was frightening because the pain did not let up for 7 to 8 hours, even after taking a Tagamet. I&#39;ve never suffered from heartburn previously other than when I was 8 months pregnant with twins. I was lucky to have any medication at home and that was only because my husband suffered from heartburn frequently. I finally fell asleep around 6:00 am for just a few hours and woke up feeling tired, but no headache or chest pain. Other than feeling tired, the symptoms appeared to all be gone. On a positive note, my arm never became sore!

I could hear it so loudly . 2weeks of brain fog ? could not stay on task (due to dehydration?)  I still can?t drink enough water and Gatorade to satisfy my thirst. Extreme Weakness, Nausea , especially when I would try to eat .  Increased thirst/ urination .  My ankles and feet swelled .  My friend who is a pharmacist instructed me to take a Tylenol but I couldn?t even get out of bed to get one to take.  ? any movement made my head swim and I felt like I would throw up.  I slept most of that day and also the next day

                                                At 23 hours post Johnson and Johnson vaccination, I began to have a 10/10 headache (which was the worst headache of my life), nausea and severe aura. I then became extremely confused and was taken to the emergency department by my husband. The following was reported to me the next day when I awoke in the ICU at Hospital: within an hour of arriving at the ED, I exhibited a progressive hyperactive delirium, agitation, slurred speech (word salad), combativeness, confabulation, word finding difficulties and an inability to follow commands. The neurologist in the ED said that she was seeing this adverse vaccination side effect in other patients at the 24-hour period. I received Haldol, Zyprexa, and Ativan to control the delirium and received a head CT angiogram in the ED, which was normal. I was transferred by ambulance to the main hospital due to acute metabolic encephalopathy/altered mental status. I was admitted to the neurological unit whereby I became critically hypotensive (60s over 30s) and was transferred to the ICU due to persistent hypotension unresponsive to IV normal saline. I was then transferred and admitted to the ICU and was given continued IV fluid resuscitation and Levophed vasopressor. I was eventually weaned from vasopressors and was discharged back home in three days exhausted, bruised, fatigued and with continuous clouded mentation. I have been told by all of the doctors that this was a vaccination side-effect, which caused cerebritis. I was subsequently treated as an outpatient at Hospital for intractable aura with IV Valporic Acid, Magnesium, and Lasix infusion on April 1, 2021.

                                                Eight days after receiving the vaccine, my wife developed shortness of breath, headache, fatigue, and unusual vision problems. She was taken to the emergency room on 4/15 where she underwent a battery of tests (see details below). She was admitted to the hospital (where she currently is) and was diagnosed with blood clots in the lungs and two strokes in the area of the brain that affects vision. She then underwent ultrasound tests of her legs and carotid artery, which were negative for signs of blood clots. Although my wife&#39;s symptoms are different than the symptoms of others that led to the vaccine pause, her doctors strongly encouraged us to report it to the VAERS. My wife had no underlying or pre existing conditions that would lead to blood clots in her lungs, and stroke. After extensive testing there is no evidence that the blood clots in her lungs as well as the clot/clots that went to her brain initiated in her legs. They believe that some sort of &#34;event&#34; would have had to happen to cause these blood clots, and the only unusual thing in the time frame of this condition is the vaccine. As I mentioned earlier, my wife is still hospitalized.

                                                I got the JNJ vaccine on Wed 4/7/21 (a wk before FDA paused that covid vaccine).  Initial response was Extreme Fatigue, but starting 11:45 pm on 4/18/21, I suffered headache, chest pain, short of breath. I could not sleep at all till 4/19/21 PM after asking my kids to pray for me. In case it&#39;s just heartburn, I took TUMS at 8:15 pm  on 4/19/21 . Headache, short of breath comes and goes, but the chest pain persists, and I develop a hot flash.  I never took birth control pills, but my OB/GYN prescribed daily Estrogen (to prevent osteoporosis) and every 3 month, Progesterone for 10 days (to prevent breast cancer). Estrogen &amp; Progesterone happen to be the birth control pills&#39; composition.  On 4/17/21, I finished my 10 days Progesterone regime. I discontinued the Estrogen supplement on 4/19/21 or 4/20/21, now (4/23/21 1:20 am) no more chest pain, but still feel fatigue, feverish with a hazy/foggy head (not really a headache).   I have a suggestion for JNJ, FDA, CDC on JNJ vaccine warning label.   If indeed those 6 women are all on birth control pills which are composed of synthetic estrogen and progesterone, then the warning label should also warn people who take these hormone supplements, instead of just an age range.

I called my urologist and was seen on 04-14-2021. My blood platelets were extremely low. I was then referred to see a hematologist who sent me to the hospital. I was admitted at Hospital where they performed lab work, MRI&#39;s and CT scans. I stayed two days at the hospital. The hematologist who saw me said I have thrombocytopenia. Other tests were also performed and they checked me for stroke and I did not have a stroke. I am concerned due to my thrombocytopenia, if I get cut, I will bleed a lot and this is interfering with my job and to carry out my daily functions.   I am still not recovered and my platelets are low. I still have to follow-up with my PCP and my hematologist has to check my bone marrow as the next step of treatment.

                                                Immediately that evening, I started to get headachy and nauseous. My arm in the injection site was very sore. The next morning, the other arm was sore. It was difficult for me to raise my arms above my head without feeling extremely weak. I couldn&#39;t lift anything above my head for the fear I would drop them. Knee replacement surgery on both knees about 4 years ago - I felt pain in my knees; all my joints; all of my teeth; my vision was blurry. My head hurt so badly. Tylenol dulled the headache and joint pain but it didn&#39;t help it to go away. My chest also hurt quite a bit. I felt extremely lethargic.  I didn&#39;t feel like getting out of bed. I could only get the  meals  made (I&#39;m a caregiver for my mom and mother-in-law) and then get back into bed. I usually walk five miles a day. I&#39;m still not there yet ( to walk that much) but I&#39;m getting better. The nausea lasted until the 17th. The headache just left finally on April 23. The body aches, teeth ache and joints subsided around the 17th also. The blurry vision - I still have a a little bit of that but it&#39;s starting to improve. The weakness in the arm - that is starting to improve - I do still feel kind of weak when I raise my arms above my head. The fatigue I still have but I&#39;m feeling a bit of improvement.  I have to keep checking my bed to see if I accidentally put the massage setting on (and I hadn&#39;t) because my body was shaking  in entire  body- That started on the second day after the vaccine and stopped about the 19th. I called to the advice nurse to register my health complaint and she had me come in for a full workup. And she asked me to go to ER. They kept me in the ER overnight.

I was diagnosed with severe sepsis and colitis.  Although I was diagnosed with sepsis, I never had a fever and all blood cultures came back negative.  Before I was released, I went into uncontrolled atrial fibrillation.  I never had any history of colitis or atrial fibrillation prior to this.  No one can explain why there was no fever or pathogen detected.

Upon review, the following information was amended: events biopsy soft tissue and brain scan abnormal was updated from non-serious to serious as this was on the earlier VAERS report.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V2: Additional information received regarding updates in seriousness of events, labeling, course of events, case identifier; and additional evets of hemorrhagic stroke and &#34;continued to  bleed&#34; did not alter prior assessment.    This fatal spontaneous report (VAERS ID 1244328) concerned a 59- year- old female who experienced vomiting, headache and seizures and was hospitalized for brain compression, brain stem hemorrhage, brain stem syndrome, cerebral hemorrhage, hemorrhagic stroke, hemiplegia, possible cerebral venous sinus thrombosis 16 days after Janssen COVID-19 vaccine was administered for prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient was pre-diabetic with no known allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. Biopsy soft tissue was done (results not reported) and brain scan showed multi-focal brain bleeds and increased compression of brain; the patient underwent neurosurgery.  The platelet count  was decreased (result not reported) and received platelet transfusion. Follow-up scan next day showed increased/continued bleeding and brain stem injury and a day later she died from possible cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. It was unknown if an autopsy was performed. Although the  subject&#39;s pre-diabetic status may have contributed, based on evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS, per definition from Brighton Collaboration - BC) and considering the low platelet count and temporal relationship to vaccination (BC Criteria level 5), the events are assessed to have a plausible relationship with vaccination.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: POSSIBLE CEREBRAL VENOUS SINUS THROMBOSIS

                                                I came home from work on the 14th and I was freezing cold. I laid on my bed and bundled up in 5 0r 6 blankets even though it was 110 degrees outside. I got up and took a couple of Tylenol and went to sleep. Got up the next day and went to work and worked through my day and took my grandchildren somewhere and I got home and I was freezing and miserable. I took a couple Tylenol. On Wednesday, my husband said &#34;This isn&#39;t normal&#34; and he took me  to Urgent Care - and they tested for COVID it came back positive for COVID. Gave me a cough medicine prescription - but it was starting to upset my stomach. Had my husband to give me bananas and applesauce and when I eat that then I take the medication so it won&#39;t upset my stomach. And I can&#39;t breathe, I cough and have fevers and pain. I am pretty sure right now I have blood clots in my legs. I get up every once in a while to get something to eat and I&#39;m really light headed and dizzy. Have to hold on to walls - don&#39;t feel stable in walking. And then I lay down in bed again.  I did get my doctor to call in a large dose of Zofran. I&#39;ve got Zofran now and two different cough medicines.  Other than the cough medicine (which makes me dizzy when I call back) - it does prevent me from coughing.  Symptoms ongoing. I&#39;ve tried to  force myself to get up more today and move around more to do a few things. I have had to take my work in small portions to fold three or four pieces of clothing and then rest a while. I don&#39;t have the energy to hardly do anything. I&#39;m nervous to going back to work. I&#39;m in the process of  recovery.

                                                I started feeling dizziness and thought I would give it a week or so, since I thought it was just a side affect that would go away. It feels like I am intoxicated, but not having fun (how the dizziness feels). Heart palpitations, thumping on my heart. I had a phone conference with my doctor yesterday and then went to ER, tested heart, sodium was a bit low. I got a CAT scan on brain and they found no abnormalities in my brain. My blood work looks good. Thyroid was checked but have not gotten the results back for that. I had numbness and tingling in my feet as well. No treatment. I am still experiencing the thumping heartbeat last night and the night before I had chest pain on my left side and cramping in the chest. I added electrolytes to my drinks, trying to get my sodium back up again. I am still experiencing the dizziness and the numbness and tingling in my feet, as well. The dizziness is interrupting my daily activities such as cooking and cleaning the house.

Then around 04-22-2021 I started getting pretty sick constantly. I went  for lab work where it demonstrated I had low platelet count, low lymphocytes, low WBC, and low protein.  I am still trying to recover today, I have a low grade fever, continue with a cough and my chest feels heavy.

                                                I had itchy, scratchy throat on the 12th in afternoon. Sunday, I woke up fully congested. I went to the pharmacy to get decongestant and I ended up going into the clinic, 13th, to get checked. There, they looked in my nose and she said it was stuffy and goopy. She wasn&#39;t convinced it was an infection so told me to wait until. On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, I worked all day and was exhausted when I went home and on Wed, 16th, I started taking the antibiotic, I just felt bad and felt really stuffy. Got a low-grade fever, was taking Tylenol. I felt went really bad and I went as a walk-in to my primary care doctor. She said to let whatever it was to take its course. I had a little bout of nausea that would come here and there (she said that was from the drip in the back of my throat). Thursday night, I got dehydrated because I wasn&#39;t drinking enough or eating enough, nothing sounded good, though. I had a really bad headache and I passed out, woke up very quickly though. I woke up and felt nauseated. Husband took me to ER. They did an EKG and other testing including COVID test, positive result. Zinc; vitamin D, I started taking it every day instead of three days a week and added vitamin C and the elderberry gummies with immune support. I drank 7-8 bottles of water with electrolytes in it a day. I was in bed for three days without getting up. I got a pulse oximeter (as instructed by nurse at ER), never got below 90. The virus never went into my chest of my lungs and I never had to use my inhaler one time. I have about 90% of taste back now; I have some of my smell back. I didn&#39;t go back to work until 29th of June and I was just working short days as I was still very, very tired. About 3PM the tiredness would hit. Into this week, I&#39;m not as tired anymore. I don&#39;t have 100% of energy back for exercising back.
