I continued to monitor her, and offered to call an ambulance again,  She did not complain of any difficulty breathing or chest tightness/pain. I continued to monitor her for twenty minutes, and then she said that she wanted to go home.  I offered to call an ambulance again, but she assured me that she felt better and wanted to go home.

                                                7 hours from vaccine, my heart started palpitating and I started feeling sick. I got in my car to go home from a friends house and started severe chills and called Doctor for fear of heart attack. They told me to go to ER. I continued driving home. Chills got worse. I got in shower with heater on and chills persisted. Drank coconut water and heart palpitations resided.  Got in bed and fever spiked to 102 and every bone was inflamed in pain. Nyquil did nothing. After a few hours of severe and unbearable pain I called ER. Headed over to ER at 3:00 a.m. and sat in parking lot. Fever broke at 3:00 a.m. which was hour 14 after vaccine. Other than severe nausea, pain calmed down. Drove home with Tylenol. Took 1,000 mg and finally rested at 4:00 a.m. Woke up at 8:00 a.m. with nausea but pain gone. 24 hours from vaccine, most of the reaction gone. 48 hours out body normal but pain in injection site.

                                                A few hours after the Thursday afternoon injection, my temp shot up and stayed right around 102, my heart rate was 135- just sitting, and my oxygen level was 93%. I shook uncontrollably the first 10-12 hours, and had chills. Tinnitus. Nothing inproved until the middle of Friday night- I sweated through sheets. Still had fever, high heart rate, and up and down oxygen for 18-20 days. My heart rate (I&#39;m on 2 anti-arrhythmia drugs so my rate is rarely above 65) was still high but better by day 22. Fever is also better but not gone. Exhausted.

                                                Felt hot within a few minutes after the vaccine, then passed out. The NP on site said she was unable to find a pulse so did 10 chest compressions before I woke up. Called the rescue squad who did an EKG on route to Hospital and once I was in the ER another EKG was performed along with blood work and chest X-ray. Entry was noted as allergic reaction but diagnosis was noted as Vasovagal Syncope, Adult. EKG?s performed along with labs were normal. I have pulled muscles, tendons and ligaments from the chest compressions which were questionable but since that day have experienced tingling in upper body and arms and have felt bad. Went back to my Primary Care Doctor for follow up on March 29 for another EKG. Have had panic attacks from the situation and per Doctor will take 2 months for my chest, muscles, tendons and ligaments to heal. Hard to determine if the way I have felt is from the vaccine or what transacted when I fainted. Today which is April 9, I still feel weak, normally I am very energetic. Just wanted to report as when I saw the news that others had some situations thought best to let you know.

                                                Was doing CDC TEXT tracing first week after injection, but new reactions started after tracking completed. Had mild reactions originally. Pain in arm, and fever next day that rose to 100.9. No chills, no major problems, no rash. A couple nose bleeds on second day which were not typical for me. Returned to work on third day. Now on day 10 I&#39;m convinced I&#39;m having a delayed reaction. Still mild but present. Low temp 99.5, headache, fatigue, feeling of not being normal. Not allowed to work today. Reason for report of such mild symptoms is my surprise of this delayed reaction 10 days later. There is a bruise on my injection arm now, opposite side of arm, that also is puzzling, but not really worrisome. Know to monitor for platelet issues.

                                                Extreme chills where my body would not stop shaking, sweats, muscle aches, nausea, bad headache, tired. Took 2 Tylenol every 4-6 hours to help the headache. It lasted until Sunday morning. My nose felt stuffy when I woke up Sunday morning at which time there was blood in my nose. The rest of the day it was clear but a small amount appeared Monday morning as well. Both sides of my temples are sore to the touch as if they were bruised. Other than that and being weak the other symptoms are gone.

The patient also had a more pronounced stroke system. We read today that people with the systems of low platelets and stoke system need to report. I have called everyone and have had no help. I believe it has to be the health department.

It felt as if there was an elephant sitting on my chest.  No real pain. No panting. Just a real heavy chest.  It is not heartburn or upset stomach - I know how that feels.   It was uncomfortable and notice I got a look of distress in my face. That&#39;s when I laid down on the couch with feet up and put my hands above my head towards the floor. After about 1.5 hours, the feeling went away.  Haven&#39;t had anything else since then.

                                                Developed heart palpitations approximately 10 hours after receiving vaccine. Also insomnia  making it impossible to sleep.  Palpitations seemed to get better by 11 am the next morning but my heart rate was still elevated ( pulse 106-112).  Shortly after that ( around 11:45 am) I became extremely light headed and dizzy and felt like I was going to pass out. I also started to feel nauseous and sweaty.   I rested lying down for two hours before hearing back from my doctor&#39;s office.  I was able to control the lightheadedness and dizziness by lying down. The feeling of passing out / nearly fainting went away.  I continued to feel nauseous and my  heartrate was still elected. I started to get a headache as well.  On the advise of a nurse at my doctor&#39;s office,  my husband took me to the ER.  My EKG was normal . My heartrate was elevated.  Due to the overcrowding at the ER that day I was made to wait at least an hour and half for further evaluation.  I continued to feel light headed and slightly dizzy. My nausea and headache got much worse .  I was finally taken back to a treatment room and received IV fluids, Zofran and Tylenol.  My heartrate went back to normal and my headache and nausea improved with treatment and I was discharged around 7pm.  I continued to feel very tired and slightly lightheaded that evening. The next morning  I was much more nauseous again and still very weak feeling and slightly lightheaded. I have  continued to feel weak, very fatigued , unwell and nauseous on and off until today, April 14, which is 6 days after I was vaccinated.

                                                Rapid heartbeat 24 hours severe stomach pain two weeks muscle and joint pain two weeks extreme high blood pressure two weeks. Extreme fatigue two weeks.  The vaccine triggered an auto immune response.  It triggered a flareup in my body and I was very ill for several weeks.  Because of my severe stomach pain and blood pressure soaring my doctor ordered a CAT scan and blood work up.   I am now three weeks post vaccine and my body seems to be calming down my blood pressure has returned to normal and the stomach pain has stopped.  The extreme fatigue muscle and joint pain is still present but much better.

I woke up and was able to spit some of it out. It was clear and also tinged with blood. It stopped once I stood up. I immediately thought my brain was leaking.  I told my daughter about this the next day.  My balance was off and I had a weird flapping in my head for the next few days.  As well as a headache.  A few days after I heard about the blood clots. I am not 100% sure if it was from the shot but it was literally hours from when I received it. It was very scary.

I sat up again, stayed for 30 sec, went to the bathroom and when I came back, I experienced severe dizziness. For the next 4 hours, I couldn&#39;t move my head and would get a zing right up the back of my neck. When I tried to sit up again, I got really sick to my stomach. After 8 hours, I started feeling better and was able to sleep on either side, but not on my back. When I was on my back everything would start spinning again. By the afternoon of the next day, I was feeling better, but was afraid to move my head too much because I didn&#39;t want everything to start up again, so I went to the doctor. My BP was high, so he had me lay on the table. He turned my head and set it off again, so I was miserable again for the next 10 hours. After that, I felt better and was able to get up and function.

Breathing was also more difficult than normal.  These symptoms lasted all day and were very concerning, but they seemed to have subsided by the next day (Monday May 17th), so I did not seek medical attention.  On Monday May 17th, I had a headache from the time I awoke and for hours thereafter. But that went away shortly after I took an aspirin.  This is my third reaction event to this vaccine. The first was a headache 3 days after the vaccine. The second was severe vomiting 3.5 weeks after the vaccine. This increased heart rate, chest pressure, difficulty breathing, and headache is the third event.

She felt faint as she walked away and wanted to sit down. After a minute or two she fainted while sitting in the chair.  Her husband who had been with her the whole time was able to arouse her after about 20 seconds.  She felt as though she needed to vomit but was did not.  After a few minutes the patient laid down on the floor.  Had a fan positioned at them and had the lights off in our pharmacy&#39;s counseling room.  After about 30 minutes she was feeling a little better and sat up on the floor and was able to drink a little ice water.  After a few more minutes she progressed to sitting up in a chair.  At no time did she have any rash, hives, or breathing issues. she said she felt very nervous.  About an hour after the immunization the patient felt like things were better and was able to stand up and walk out on her own.  she held on to her husband&#39;s arm as a back up in case she felt faint again.

Morning they were gone. Slightly after that, I had some fatigue but nothing major. I was pretty normal. Then I noticed a few weeks later some swelling under my arms - lymph nodes swollen. I was very aware that they were touching. That seemed to last for a couple of months. I have just become aware the last few weeks that those symptoms with the swollen lymph nodes are gone. About 6 weeks to two months ago - I have been getting pounding heart and a bit of difficulty breathing. May be related stress. It comes and goes and then about a month ago I started a stress reduction supplement protocol and started doing meditation but they were still there and so I went to the doctor. She did an EKG  and general physical and she didn&#39;t find anything that showed up abnormal with heart. The  heart pounding and the breathing issues I&#39;m still noticing.

                                                2 weeks after getting the vaccine I experienced a horrible headache that lasted 2 weeks. None of my migraine meds worked on this headache. It was constant, for 2 weeks. It then started letting up, but I woke up with half my face being numb. It starts at my lips and moves up my face to my lower eye lid. My upper teeth are also numb on that side. The left side, When that happened I went to the ER as advised by my doctor (4-12-21). My blood pressure was very high so they treated me for that and did a CAT scan of my head and found nothing.  I was sent home. Saw my Neurologist the next day 4-13-21, She ordered an MRI which was done on 4-17-21. Nothing significant was found.   I also saw my Primary care doctor that same week.  He did bloodwork to rule out auto immune diseases.  Bloodwork was good. I also went to see my dentist that week to rule out dental problems. He did an xray and did not think it was dental related. The numbness is still there.  It has not gone away

                                                I felt no immediate side effects of the shot, but 2 hours later, while sitting calmly, my heart rate suddenly elevated and I began to feel light headed. My home blood pressure monitoring kit provided a reading of 149/99 and a resting heart rate of 108. Normally, my blood pressure is very well maintained with my meds and hovers in the 118/75 range. My resting heart rate is usually below 70. I was going to dial 911 but within 5 minutes, my heart rate began to slow down and I felt better. When I rechecked my numbers at 8 pm, BP was down to 118/80 and resting heart rate was 70.

Twenty minutes after shot, felt skin flush pass over me and was directed to private area where paramedic took blood pressure and checked for hives. No hives but bumpy skin. Blood pressure spiked to 186/75. No history of such high blood pressure. Waited a while and blood pressure went down, flush and skin bumps subsided, and I went home. Blood pressure erratic in evening but never as high. Next day pulse higher than normal. Took homeopathic remedy. Pulse slowed down a bit. Better by next day.

My life partner started calling my name and check my pulse (which he said was strong) ; then I came to but was really dizzy; I was nauseous and vomited for a few minutes; extremely hot/sweating; and after I stopped vomiting, then had a bowel movement (He had to aid me in getting to the bathroom).   About 20 - 25 minutes later I felt much better; everything calmed down.  I was ultimately able to fall back to sleep.

                                                By 6pm, I started feeling feverish, with chills, nausea, chest pains and abdominal pain. I also experienced headaches and my fever got up to 102.5. I went to the ER and they gave me fluids. I was told it was a reaction to the vaccine, but my paperwork said upper respiratory infection. My cough started out dry, I had SOB, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea and joint pain. My PCP put me on a steroid and an antibiotic Keflex (500mg, 3 times a day). I get lightheaded just walking around the house. I&#39;m still experiencing SOB, fatigue and the cough. Today is the first day that I could get up an move around. I&#39;m fine when I first wake up, but I eventually feel depleted.

I started having shortness of breath and chest tightness. I acknowledge that the shortness of breath could have been due to panic, but the allergic reaction came first and was most definitely real. I also have muscle twitching on my left hand, which started after the shot. I&#39;ve had it now for 28 hours. I got the shot on my left arm.

                                                Beginning approximately 10 PM (about 8 hours post-injection), I started to have chills (feet were freezing) and was exhausted. Went to bed, and slept most of the night, only waking once to urinate and to drink a small amount (approx 2 oz) of Coca Cola -- I was very nauseous and thought it would help settle my stomach. During the night I sweated profusely. At 8 AM,  I woke again and went to urinate. At that time I felt very nauseous, dizzy, and light headed. When I walked about 2 -3 feet to my bedroom, I collapsed on the floor - unconscious. My partner called EMS, they arrived minutes later. By then I was conscious. They transported me to Medical Center Emergency Room, where I remained for several hours. They indicated that my SYNCOPE was a result of dehydration. TODAY, 4/13, news of BLOOD CLOTS has compelled me to report my adverse reaction.

Her mental status continued to decline over 2 week period, at which time she was brought to the hospital on April 13th. At that time, it was determined the patient had suffered an age-indeterminant ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion. No neurosurgical interventions were done at this time as patients symptoms have appeared to improve after observation.

                                                Whether the adverse events were caused by the vaccine is to be determined.  We are available to discuss more details if this information can be used to help others from experiencing these reactions.  The morning after getting the vaccine, patient discovered that she could not swallow.  As her condition worsened, she was taken to the emergency room.  Over the past month, patient went to the emergency room 4 times.  The last time resulted in extended hospitalization that continues to this day.  In addition to the swallowing problem, two other major adverse events need to highlighted.  First, on 27 March, while in the hospital, vaginal bleeding started.  On 29 March, her doctor, performed a hysteriscopy/DNC finding &#34;  &#34;an unexplained blood clot (hematoma).&#34;  The second major event was when patient demonstrated significant confusion and lack of memory.  On 7 April, she was diagnosed with Metabolic Encephalopathy.  Neurologists at the hospital suspected that her MS was reacting to her UTI and once the infection is eliminated her memory should come back.  But as of 10 April, she was still having issues including hallucinations.  Although she is eating some as of 13 April, she is still very weak and will likely by moved from the Hospital to a rehab facility.  She still does not remember much of the last 37 days.

Stayed off my feet. Right foot became very cold. 3/30/21 Saw my primary care physician at med center. She sent me for an ultrasound at medical arts. From there I was sent to the emergency room at hospital. I asked the attending physician assistant about a correlation between the blood clot and the Covid vaccine because I had read about it being a concern in other countries. He stated that was a bunch of baloney. Was told to have a repeat ultrasound in a few days and was prescribed a 30 day starter pack of Xarelto and released.  3/30 repeat penis ultrasound of right leg showed the same results. 4/1 appointment with hematologist. Prescribe Xarelto for three months and ordered a repeat ultrasound in three months and bloodwork at that time.

                                                Progress Notes - Clinical MD at 4/15/2021  1:30 PM     HPI:  61 year old female with IBS presents with concerns about adverse reactions to vaccine which she got on 3/19/21.   Patient reports that she felt lightheaded after the vaccine when she was leaving. She got home and felt better but then that night woke up in a delirium which passed by the morning. She had some weakness in her extremities, brain fog, cold feeling, funny GI feeling and fatigue for 3 days and then was fine.   Two weeks ago she started to feel that the circulation in her lower legs was cut off with sensation of blood pooling in her legs with associated numbness and tingling. She describes it as what you feel when a tourniquet is applied to your arm.  No visible lower extremity swelling, redness and no pain.    One week ago she felt like her right hand was not working well and then left hand too. She then felt pooling in her arms like the sensation in her legs.No swelling, redness or pain.   She reports she did a hand stand and afterward felt pooling sensation in her lower abdomen which has since resolved but continues to have a prickling sensation that comes and goes.   Last night while lying on her back she felt the pooling sensation in her chest and this morning throbbing in head and chest and neck. That is when she decided to come in and be seen.    Patient denies severe headache, backache, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, bruises, unusual bleeding or rashes.   Patient has not had a physical exam with blood work since 11/9/17.

                                                My sister, received the J &amp; J vaccine on March 5th.  I now know that she was not feeling well for a few days afterwards.  She then felt better until day nine after the vaccine.  On the evening of the ninth day,  she began having abdominal pain, vomiting &amp; diarrhea, headache. This was Sunday evening.  Unfortunately I wasn?t aware of how she was feeling and she didn?t go to the emergency rm. until Tuesday morning.  Tests determined her platelet level was low and abdominal CT showed bleeding from her adrenal glands.  She was given platelets, pain meds and admitted into the hospital.  Later that night staff felt she wasn?t responsive and a head CT was performed.  It was determined she had a brain hemorrhage and emergency surgery was performed. It is my understanding that there was brain damage at that point.  During the early morning hours of the 10th day, post surgery, a repeat CT scan was done showing more hemorrhaging and blood clots. She also developed a  DVT and PE and was kept on a respirator until the 13th day post vaccine to allow family to say their goodbyes.  On the morning of the 13th day patient was removed from life support and she passed.

Began at around 10am. Felt like I was dying. Placed on Stroke Unit. Scans and tests all negative for stroke and Drs. thought could be panic attack or TIA. Since then my lingering effects point to TIA, Seemed to clear up around 2pm with gradual improvement through the day. Still experiencing some side effects including tinnitus, memory and word retrieval issues, fatigue, anxiety.  DO NOT HAVE PANIC ATTACKS. The only time I have had a panic attack was at 26 after the death of my mother.

Got it stopped. Next day felt a bit off but okay.  At 9 pm 3-28-2021 had a huge bloody nose, just came out of nowhere.  Looked inside was coming from not the nose walls but from way up inside sinus cavity?  Tried to get it stopped, nothing worked, and 2 times it came out my mouth. Called our local Emergency room, went in.  Blood pressure was at one time 220/110. They gave me 2 sprays of Affrin to reduce blood vessels, and tried to insert a nose plug (cotton gauze) to stop it, wouldn&#39;t fit, too small of nasal passage.   Administered 2 pills,  then drugs through IV then another pill form over 4 hours later blood pressure was still high some numbers while there were 204/94, 188/93 then when released and bleeding stopped 188/86.  Next day 3-26-2021 immediately after taking my regular meds bleeding started again!!! So tried to get appointment with my doctor, they were full advised me to go /back to ER. Went about 1:00pm my BP was 181/73 Dr ran tests: EKG normal, Blood tests, good, and chest e-x-ray good. She also tried 2 diff types of meds, oral and iv, then I asked for losartan.  and left.

Left ring finger went numb, white and cold, with bruise appearing on the middle digit. Other finger tips turned pink. Skin turned red onhands with tingling sentation. Right hand blood vessels came to the surface and began to swell at intersections. Skin on rt. hand looked whiter and dry. The sudden onset sent me to the emergency room, the condition began to fade in 3 hours, not completely. The same reaction occured the next day at 12 noon. I took a hot shower and the condition improved followed by extreme tiredness. *At the time of vaccination, &amp; on both of these events I had a stiff neck/red skin.

                                                That night, no chills or fever but uncontrollable shaking - 10 pm - 4 am in morning. Starting at 10, as well, body aches - run over by a truck type. My chest was burning like it was on fire - lungs felt like they were on  fire. I woke up the next morning, with a little bit of body aches - I slept the entire next day pretty much (the 7th). On the 7th, I noticed that my heart was beating - fluttering- skipping- beating. My left left also swelled up and was red. I had  PVCs with pulmonary embolism on that left leg  in1996 - when I was doing the chemo. My left leg ached, burned and got red on the 7th. I was going to see the PCP the following week and I was still having issues with the heart but the leg was getting better. It can still swell, burn and get red quite a bit of night because I stand on my legs all day - but the amount of pain and swelling did go down over that week while I was waiting to see the doctor. I had an ultrasound on my leg. And a heart halter to monitor my heart for 24 hours. I do have PVCs.  Stress from vaccine caused Herpes Outbreak - that was on the left inner thigh right next to genitals - bumps within four days of vaccine.  Created more pain. Took Benadryl for pain - helps with the nerve pain - two days with. I took 3000 mg a day of Tylenol for three days after the vaccine.  Have not recovered from the calf and heart symptoms.

She sent me for a doppler on my legs where a blood clot was found  behind my right knee.  I started taking Xarelto that night - 15mg twice daily for 21 days.  The pain increased considerable and by 4/20/2021 I could hardly walk.  I went back to the doctor that day and she ordered a second doppler study.  The blood clot was stable but there was no change.  Continued on the Xarelto.  Third visit to the doctor on 5/5/2021.  Some lessening of the pain by then.  Doctor changed the Xarelto dosage to 20 mg. one a day for the next two months.  Then we&#39;ll schedule another doctor visit and probably another Doppler Study.

My face was drooping, I couldn&#39;t say my A,B,C&#39;s, and by the time I got to the ER they got me on an IV. I couldn&#39;t talk, think, and had the metal taste for a few hours.

BP went down to  178/98, taste started to go down, I was drinking fluids, I was able to talk a little bit. I felt like in a &#39;bubble&#39;, I couldn&#39;t think.

Her blood pressure was 174/86 and her pulse was fluctuating in the mid-high 80s. I administered 1 tablet of diphenhydramine (25mg) and 1 dose of the 0.3mg epi-pen. After about 7-10 minutes, she said her symptoms started to level out and were no longer getting worse. Her lip swelling started going down by the time EMS arrived. I continuously checked her blood pressure, heart rate, and heart rhythm while waiting for EMS to arrive and take over her care. They took her to the closest emergency room for continued monitoring.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included hypertension, hypothyroidism, and intermittent pancytopenia, and concurrent conditions included metronidazole allergy, hashimoto&#39;s disease, and microscopic colitis. The patient was previously treated with metronidazole.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 1805018, and expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 09-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included amlodipine, levothyroxine, losartan, rosuvastatin calcium, and ubidecarenone.  On 09-Mar-2021, the patient got the vaccine and after few days she had aches and pains (very mild reaction) and went to bed early. The patient thought she was fine. On 18-Mar-2021, 04:00, she woke up with an excruciating headache above her left eye in her eyebrow. The patient wondered if it was an aneurysm and took 2 tablets of extra strength Tylenol and it helped. The patient stated that after every 5-6 hours, excruciating headache came back. The patient had the same headache for over a week. The patient got tested for Covid-19 and it was negative. The patient thought she had sinus problems but had no other symptoms. On 30-Mar-2021, the patient woke up with headache. Her eye was killing her, was sore and swollen, and felt like it was going to burst and her left eye was swollen shut in a couple of hours. The patient narrated it was excruciatingly painful. The patient&#39;s husband drove her to urgent care, where ophthalmology tested the pressure: right eye was normal (she thinks it was 18- normal) and the left eye was 51 (normal is 14-19), units unspecified (intraocular pressure decreased). The eye doctor started prednisone and the patient had a CT scan and lab work done. MRI was also ordered but they were unable to do it right away. On unspecified date in Dec/2020 the platelets were 349 in December and came down to 64, which was very low (low threshold was 150) (thrombocytopenia). The CT scan was performed, they thought she had a cavernous carotid fistula and she was scheduled for an angiogram for a further diagnosis on 01-Apr-2021. The angiogram determined she did not have fistula. The patient was admitted to the hospital after the angiogram and on 02-April-2021, MRI was done. All throughout the process, the ophthalmologist, radiologist and internist all thought it was related to the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. The prednisone started working and the pressure started dropping in her eye. The patient states that doctors think an artery burst behind her eye. After discharge, the patient was taking prednisone which was helping. On the 13th, she was watching television and saw that the vaccine was being put on hold due to the women with clots whose progression matched hers exactly (severe headaches, low platelets, and required attention). She was on prednisone for a month. Laboratory data (dates unspecified) included: COVID-19 virus test negative (NR: not provided) negative, CT scan (NR: not provided) Not reported, and Platelet count (NR: not provided) 64 (units unspecified). Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included: prednisone, and paracetamol. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from thrombocytopenia, intraocular pressure decreased, ocular discomfort, periorbital swelling, and eye pain, excruciating headache on 02-APR-2021, and aches and pains on 12-MAR-2021, and the outcome of artery burst behind her eye was not reported.

                                                8 hours after getting the vaccine I started feeling very cold. It came on me all of a sudden.  Shaking, shivering, teeth chattering ensued along with generally feeling very unwell.  (Similar to how I felt years ago after having surgery)  This progressed during the night to fever, chills, extreme body aches, stabbing pains in the head, heart racing, dizziness and nausea.  After 12 hours I started to feeling improvement.  At the 16 hour mark I am really tired and nauseous but feel like I&#39;m coming back.  Probably the worst I&#39;ve ever felt.  We considered going to the ER in the night.

I woke up and I was talking gibberish. I was aware that nothing I said was making sense. I went to bed and slept almost 24 hours. I woke up feeling wiped out but I wasn&#39;t confused and I was talking normal again. Right arm hurt and is numb. ( right side of my body typically is kind of numb but the right arm seemed more so numb after the vaccine)

                                                The actual injection itself was so painful that I almost passed out. It hurts so badly while the needle was in my arm and when she took it out it was worse. I was in such pain that I began to sweat profusely and apparently I turned white and began dry heaving. This was all within a minute or so.  I really thought I was going to pass out. A woman with a tag that said pharmacist came rushing over. She got a reclining chair with wheels, they help me into it and then took me to a recovery room. After a few more minutes of sweating and dry heaving I began feeling better.  The pharmacist got me some paper towels so I could dry myself off as I was drenched in sweat. I asked her for a bottle of water. I waited the 15 minutes and came home.  They never checked my vital signs. Once I got home, I laid down and slept for 15 hours. I was fine the next day and my arm was never sore.  Could  the shot have hit a nerve? I?ve never felt such acute pain.

As she was walking up to the post vaccination waiting area after receiving the vaccine, she suffered what appeared to be an anxiety attack and fainted. She awoke quickly and was monitored by pharmacy staff. She maintained good blood pressure and was fine afterwards.

                                                A few minutes after the vaccine my heart began palpatating and I began sweating profusely.  My vitals were checked, I was given water and moved to a cooler area of the facility.  HR was still elevated but I wasnt feeling as flushed.  By 4pm that evening I began having having chills and a fever of 100-100.4 which lasted about 4hrs.  Later that evening my HR elevated to 125 with the feeling of feeling I was having a heart attack.  By that Wed. my HR was still at 125 in motion and about 75 still so I went to visit my PCP on Thurs and when I arrived the HR was 77 but during the visit it elevated to 125 and blood work was done resulting in my tyroid level elevated and since getting the vaccine my HR had been up and down.  When in motion its elevated and when sitting its around 75.

I thought it was my N95 mask so decided to head to the car after my 15 minute wait period was completed.  After sitting down in the car I started the following symptoms:  shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, swelling of face, dizziness, weakness.  I sit in the car for approximately 15 minutes then headed home.  I had a driver (thank goodness).  I continued to have symptoms and what felt like elevated blood pressure (I did not have access to a pressure cuff).  After resting at my driver&#39;s house for about 5 hours I felt better and headed home.  The next morning the symptoms were less but still present.  In addition I had a slight rash on my stomach that wrapped around my back.  After approximately 48 hours all of the symptoms subsided.  My blood pressure had returned to normal also.  All swelling went down.

                                                One week after my vaccination, I had what I thought was an asthma attack. I used my inhaler and it eased the symptoms for a short while, but I had to use it again a short time later as my breathing was a bit labored. My chest tightened up and it was hard to take deep breaths. From that date on, I have had tightness in the lungs and it hurts to breath deeply. It is getting so I am tired now after having this issue for the past 10 days or more. It seems to come and go and is not constant, but it does happen every day since March 10, 2021.

I took 2.5mg of Ambian thinking that if I could just fall asleep, I would sleep it off. After an hour of non-stop symptoms, I fell asleep for about an hour only to wake up  with the severe neck and back pain and headache still present. The body shaking had subsided.   The next day, I was tired but fine.

                                                Upon waking 2 days after receiving vaccine, I suffered from excruciating headache that was incapacitating.  It did not resolve with aspirin, which prompted me to check my blood pressure.  My BP was extremely elevated at 145/85.  I then took 1 dose of common &#34;water pill&#34; 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide.  This did not bring down BP or resolve headache, 2 hours later I took 20 mg of Valsartan.  This also did not resolve headache or lower BP, so I took another 20 mg of Valsartan, followed by another 25 mg of water pill.  My BP stabilized later that evening and headache resolved by 8 p.m.  This same event occurred 2 more times, the last day being 4/10/21.  On that date I was completely incapacitated by excruciating headache.  I took 40 mg of Valsartan but headache did not resolve until late that evening.

I alerted the person at the vaccination site saying something was not right and then they called the paramedics who took my vitals and said my heart rate and blood pressure was extremely high. They gave me a shot of Benadryl and oxygen because I was feeling shortness of breath. They kept me until about 11:35 in observation when I felt myself again. The headache, nausea and body aches stayed for about 2 weeks but all other symptoms subsided.

Then began to get headache with slight fever and the headache got progressively worse, with nausea and rapid heart rate. The headache was so bad I could not sleep at all - the worst headache I have ever had. I took one extra-strength Tylenol at about 10 or 11 am the next day, March 12, which took the edge off the headache. The headache diminished till it was gone by about 8 or 9 pm. The rapid heart rate, along with tiredness, low energy, and feeling jittery continued for several days, then stopped.

By the fourth day after the vaccine her right leg was completely swollen, twice as big as its normal size, the pain was unbearable and she experienced fatigue and shortness of breath. I took her to the ER  on 04/14/2021

Began having a dry cough, went to nurse to as if normal, she said no, she started monitoring me. Still had cough, then became light headed and nausea. She gave me 25 mg of  Benadryl,  coughing continued, breathing became rapid, then I was given  shot of epi,  I became dizzy again and couldn?t complete a sentence. Words were slurred, heart beat racing. EMT?s were called. Received another shot of  Benadryl. It did not counteract anything. Received another shot of epi. Had uncontrollable shakes and hard to breathe or speak.  Was difficult to get BP reading due to shaking. Finally got reading of 196/99. EMT listened to heart and lungs. Said all was good. Taken to ER for monitoring of heart, Lungs and BP. Was there for approximately 2 hours u til shakes and BP were good.

                                                I called a message that patient had experienced a stroke recently and had also rececived the Jansson vaccine. I called patient, who had reported that it happened on 4/2. She had woke up and couldn&#39;t put her robe on. Her left arm was not working right. She also noted  that she had drooled. She kept thinking that she was find and got ready and went to work. During work she was typing and found that her left hand was not working still, but still went throughout her day and typed with her right hand. Later that evening when she got home, her husband took her to the ER. There, she reports that her blood pressure was through the roof. She had a CT scan and MRI and labs done and was diagnosed with a TIA. She was started on Plavix, baby aspirin, and was started on a statin drug (couldn&#39;t remember the name as that information was at home and she was at work at time of call). She is on a heart monitor for 4 weeks and has follow ups with her outside PCP and cardiologist. Today she states that she is feeling back to normal and has regained function on her left side. She reports that she had a headache at time that had lasted for a while. She also reports that she feels like she was having issues weeks before because her brain felt foggy and just was not thinking right.

                                                I received the Janssen COVAX on Monday morning, 5 Apr 2021.  A week later, on Monday evening, 12 Apr 2021, I experienced extremely painful leg cramps and broke out in a sweat. I felt extremely nauseous, and weak, this was followed by a sever pain in my head that was so extreme that I passed out. After coming to, the pain in my head finally began to subside, along with the leg cramps. My husband indicated that I was unconscious for just under a minute.  For the next two days, I had bouts of nausea, headaches, sweats, and was extremely tired.  On Wednesday, 14 Apr, after learning of the issues related to the Janssen vaccine, and the symptoms described being what I experienced, I contacted the advice (cont&#39;d)..Additional information for Item 18: Line and was told to go to Emergency Room at the hospital, which I did.  I do not feel that they addressed my concerns or the symptoms that I was experiencing, and at no time did they try to determine if it was due to the vaccine.  The discharge papers did not even address the &#34;event&#34; and the &#34;symptoms&#34; that I described.  They did not take any information down related to the vaccine, lot number, etc., that I had received.  They seemed to go through a set routine:  blood pressure, blood work, temperature, EKG, and CAT scan.    21. (continued)...Visited Emergency Room, however, was requested by ER to go to Primary Care as follow-up, however, as a  Employee we cannot be seen by Primary Care on THIS site.  Instead , we have to go on the local clinic to receive care.  The issue is that this was a vaccine that I was scheduled by my leadership to receive, with no choice in choosing which vaccine I could receive, and without follow-up care for adverse reactions. The hospital did not indicate to me that I should report this incident, however, I am concerned as a result of the &#34;event&#34; that I experienced, that it should be reported.  Furthermore,we should have a choice as to which vaccine we want to receive, just as everyone does.  Your form does not allow for input addresses  Also, your form does not allow for a phone number.

                                                2 hours after receiving the vaccine, I grew exhausted and had to sleep into late evening and was chilled,  had a fever of 101 and developed severe pain and inflammation on the top of my collar bone that was feverish and migrated toward my shoulder region on the same side as my vaccine. Ibuprofen would not help with the pain but helped with the fever. My mind told me that I had things to tend to the next day, but still was forced to sleep off and on for 2 more days. After a week and a half, not only did I have thirst, but also food didn&#39;t taste right and was metallic.  This lasted for 2 days and finally my taste was restored. The exhaustion lasted off and on for 2 weeks and I just listened to my body. The pain and inflammation on my collar bone has subsided 4 days ago but still have pain in my shoulder when I sleep.  On April 5 around 8:30 a.m. a nasty virus hit me out of the blue. I grew week and tired and had to go to bed. I slept all day until around 9:00 p.m. and woke to uncontrollable diarrhea and fainting spell while in the bathroom. I had abominable pain and nausea that last for a half hour and then I returned to bed. The next 2 days, I was week and exhausted but continued with my regular routine.  My equilibrium is still affected from time to time.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included depression, and penicillin allergy. The patient had no current illness. The patient had no heart problems, no pulmonary problem and diabetes. The patient experienced drug allergy when treated with paracetamol.

Concomitant medications included levomilnacipran hydrochloride for depression, and quetiapine fumarate for depression.  On an unspecified date in APR/2021, little more than a week after single-dose coronavirus vaccine at hospital facility the patient felt general malaise and minor pain in her right side. The patient had shortness of breath, and she looked anxious and her heart rate was very fast. The vital signs were not stable. The physician suspected that patient had developed pulmonary embolism blood clots in her lungs. When combined with her vitals, the doctor knew it was an emergency. The patient also began to feel mildly ill. She was experienced general malaise, soreness on her right side, and while she was not struggling to breathe, it hurt when she took a deep breath, her right-hand side, like under her ribs, she felt some pain. It was not a bad pain, not enough to take anything for it but just noticed it. The symptoms seemed minor, and at the time. It was reported that by 21-APR-2021, she still was not feeling well and decided to make an appointment at the urgent care center. The patient visited emergency room or department/urgent care facility for treatment of the events. The patient soon learned she had developed blood clots (pulmonary embolism) in both lungs due to the vaccine, a doctor at the hospital told her. One of her lungs also had collapsed. She had developed blood clots in both lungs due to the vaccine, she was there for 10 hours (undergoing tests). The patient underwent a computerized tomography scan and an X-ray. They did everything and got the results of the CAT scan, with pulmonary embolism in both lungs. They immediately gave her some blood thinner and was as hospitalized (date unspecified). It was reported that she would spend five days in the hospital.  According to the doctors this was from the vaccine. The patient was also experiencing the pain on the right-hand side and also started getting myalgia, muscle aches just in different parts of her body. The patient&#39;s legs also felt weird. So they rushed her down and gave a sonogram in her legs to check for deep vein thrombosis. The pain on her right side grew worse for a day or two, and she was treated with morphine. The doctors surmised the patient had fluid in the bottom of her lung, which her body eventually absorbed. The patient was still on a blood thinner and continued to recover. Laboratory data included: Heart rate (NR: not provided) very fast, and Sonogram (NR: not provided) Not provided.

I saw Dr. about my allergies and allergic reaction.

Fell hard and knocked shower out of track.  Woke up throwing up massively.  My husband ran in and helped me.  I threw up a lot and had chills.  After cleaning up, went to bed and piled on blankets.  Woke up again sometime in the 11 to midnight range and threw up once more.  Still chilled.  About 3 a.m. I woke up and removed all the blankets as I felt okay again.   I never found a place to report this in my daily reports as within 24 hours I felt normal again.  I am 100% positive this was a reaction to the vaccine.  I did not need to seek medical treatment as it passed within 6 hours or so.

                                                My heart started feeling funny. I walk a lot and we usually walk four miles 4 or 5 days a week. I told her my chest felt funny. It didn&#39;t funny. It felt like heart was pounding. I waited about a month before I went to doctor - never had it in my life this kind of thing. It beats out of whack ( my heart) - I feel it mostly at rest. If I lie down I can hear heart beating in my ear. It is still occurring. The next step would maybe be to take beta blockers but haven&#39;t tried that yet. My doctor can hear it. It&#39;s constant - it is always is doing it. When I stop and slow down, I hear that it&#39;s beating irregular.

                                                In the evening I started to feel aches in my eyes and joints.  I was having trouble falling asleep.  I woke up every 2 hours. My heart bpm went up to 102 in the middle of the night.  I know this because my fit bit was vibrating and encouraging me to keep exercising and I was just laying in bed trying to sleep.  I finally got up around 2:30 in the morning and took 1 Aleve. I also took my temperature with a forehead type and it was 98.5, so no high fever.  I took another Aleve around 7:00 in the morning.  Now I am feeling fine.  It&#39;s now 8:22 a.m. and I am working from home.  I just wanted to report that the aches in joints and 102 bpm and unable to fall asleep were my side effects.  I feel fine now.  I will continue to take Aleve as needed.   I have never been tested for Covid.  I have never had any symptoms to warrant testing for covid.  Since March 13, 2020 I have been fortunate to work for a company that has us all working from home.  We are still working from home.  i am 63 years old.  I shop around 6 a.m. in the morning for groceries to avoid people. I do not go out.  I have been very careful.

About 8 hours after injection, muscle ached and so was chilled but felt ok otherwise.  FitBit alerted me that I was earning points for being in my ?active zone? even though I was just watching tv - resting heart rate is 66   (actively exercising, heart rate  is usually less than 120) but it was 136&#43;.  HR stayed elevated ( Verified HR with pulse oximeter) while I was not  doing anything. Took temperature (forehead thermometer) and it was 103F.  Took Tylenol. Heart rate slowly went down after Tylenol kicked in and fever came down to 101.  Heart rate stayed a little higher than normal and fever lasted 24 hours. By 48 hours, all was well.

No COVID test was administered. When she felt better, she was released. A few days later, she discovered her tongue was sore and red. She called her primary care physician (PCP). PCP said the red and sore tongue was probably related to allergies. Two weeks later, her tongue was not sore, but still red. They advised her to get a second opinion with another HCP. She was going to visit her allergy specialist.. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable.

She reported onset of headache and fatigue day of vaccine. She reported later feeling short of breath and having a  decreased tolerance of activity.  She stated she had an elevated heartrate and &#34;neurological symptoms&#34;, but did not specify. She reports still feeling off at this time 4/13 and having appointments scheduled with a Vascular surgeon and neurologist in the near future. I am doing the reporting as the vaccine was given by Public Health staff, but this is the first notification we have received of the her potential adverse reaction.

On the 12th had severe chest pains which I chalked up to a very bad case of heart burn.  On March 24th, while driving I had two major (what I thought at the time) was panic attacks...body started shaking, heart was beating like crazy, couldn&#39;t catch my breath, felt like I was going to pass out or die.  Had to pull over twice to calm myself down.  (From what I read this could be a sign of a blood clot but I am not a doctor.)  Had minor heart burn until April 5th....which ironically was the end of my 28 days until the vaccine fully kicked in.  Just reporting what happen.  I feel fine now.

Went to urgent care on unspecified date. NP examined me and discovered a lump in my arm. Both the lump and the vaccination site hurt when she pressed on them. She prescribed presdone and gave me a work order for a vascular ultrasound to be performed on my left arm. I went on unspecified date for the scan. It was discovered that a DVT blood clot had formed in my brachial vein in the left arm. I was then prescribed eliquis, 20 mg a day for 7 days and told not to take the predesone. NP called my pcp, his office immediately called me and asked me to come in as they are concerned about the high dosage of the eliquis.

Two weeks after the shot I was very pale, and my stomach was very upset. I had a headache and abdominal pain. I felt very ill so I didn&#39;t eat or drink much that day.  The smell of food made me throw up and felt really bad for 24 hours. I did not eat much for three days and it helped my nausea and I recovered after four days I still had the unusual feeling all over my body. I got some IV therapy twice and it helped. It did start to fade over time and I finally started to feel normal after a month. I am fully recovered now.

                                                Patient went to ER 4/4/21 with severe headache, inability to stay awake. CT scan of the head revealed multiple areas of SAH (unexplained no head injury) and a very large ruptured MCA aneurysm. Patient was COMPLETELY asymptomatic prior to vaccination. The aneurysm was repaired with success but the cerebral hemorrhages kept appearing - unexplained. Cerebral edema became so severe (midline shift up to 9-10mm) neurosurgery ended up performing a burr hole craniotomy to relieve pressure as well as placement of a ventriculostomy. This patient later ended up with severe vasospasms which results in an ischemic stroke of the L frontal lobe. Patient later died in a rehabilitation facility, all of this secondary to the Janssen vaccine. This vaccine should not be administered until further studied. This was a healthy 63 year old woman. Vitals always WNL labs WNL very active, BMI WNL. Absolutely NO comorbidities. A lifelong nurse who raised 2 nurses of her own.  These events took place for over a month. The trauma not only the patient has experienced but her family is unforgivable.

                                                The injection did hurt quite a bit more than other injections I have had in the past but it began to feel better and I sat in a chair and was on my phone to send a message, spoke to a stranger who was looking for where to go, and was ok until the feeling of fainting began 10 minutes after the shot. I put my head between my knees but it did not help so I called for help and eventually was helped onto the floor to lie down which began to help. I had vision trouble and hearing trouble and could not speak. I was told my neck became bright red as my face grew white and my hands twitched and my eyes rolled around. I found out later that I had also peed my pants. I have fainted only once before in 1989, and found this reaction pretty frightening although I do not believe it happened as a result of anxiety or fear, the adverse effect itself was frightening and unexpected- not listed on any paperwork I received and was not aware it could occur.

                                                25 March 2021  Woke up with severe pain, left chest, breathing was fine, however, it was very painful to breath, laugh, cough or sneeze and walking. It was painful to roll out of bed each morning at least for a week or so. I live with the pain/discomfort for a few days, thinking it would get better.   30 March 2021  I called my PCP, who had no appointments, I ask the appointment person to have someone from her office call me. They call back later in the day and said that the dr was fully booked and ask if I was willing to see someone else, answer was yes.  see continuation page

I determined that when I get into bed there is no reason for my blood pressure to be this high and 10 years ago I had another reaction to allergies meds. so I stopped taking it on 5/03, I still have upset stomach but I think it something that I ate. Since I stopped taking the meds my blood pressure has been yester, yesterday it was 144/71. In general I feel good.

                                                I had no regular symptoms, but a few days later I sat down in my chair and it felt like someone shot me in the stomach, I took oxycodone, it kept getting worse and I dealt with it for a week. I started getting pain in my kidney and went to the ER because of the pain and the pain level on a scale of 1-10 was a 8-9 at all times.  I couldn&#39;t&#39; breathe and was rushed to the hospital. I have portal vein thrombosis and have three blood clots in my stomach.  I tried to figure out what to do to relieve the pain, I couldn&#39;t eat or during and was on IV&#39;s. I was in so much pain to even eat a cracker, they kept me at the hospital.  While in the hospital they did a CAT scan to see if it was diverticulitis and found out that I had 3 blood clots, they also did the dye or contrast. I spent days in the hospital and was transferred to the hospitals skilled nursing facility so that they can watch me because of the clots. I was told that the blood clots could burst in the vein.

Stopped Fergon on June 4th per doctor&#39;s recommendation. My symptoms have gone away since I&#39;ve taking that iron. I will get blood drawn again August 2021.

                                                About 5 days after the shot, I was still having a lot of fatigue, but I developed severe headaches, like someone was sticking a knife in my head, and I was having bouts of light headedness.  I am a person who never has headaches.   Because the issue of the blood clots came about with the J&amp;J, I ended up, because of the severe headeaches  had to have a brain MRI to rule out the blood clots.  I did not have any.  But the headaches were very much a problem and the light headedness.  I had to leave area for the summer, and now came to another area.  I still was not feeling right.  The bad headaches subsided, but I was till getting the lightheadedness with a slight headache after almost every day.  II also had a full blood panel done on April 8.  It is showing my thyroid is low and now have to be on Thyroid medication.  I just had full blood work done in March, and all my blood work was normal.  I also have noticed that my arthritis in my hands is exacerbated.  And sometimes my feet go numb when I am riding my horse.  And in the morning, my arms and legs ache.  My  BP was a little elevated as well. I never have had high blood pressure.     I am 63 years old and have always had great health.   Since I had the covid shot,  I have had nothing but problems.   If I had to do it over again, I WOULD NOT have gotten the shot.  I only got it because my daughter was having a baby and insisted even though I had the virus back in October.

                                                It began with being light-headed and difficulty walking on March 25th. On April 14 I had my first &#34;seizure like&#34; event as I was going to teach school. I had Upper arm tremors and difficulty speaking and walking. Sent by ambulance to the emergency room. Released later that day and given meds for UTI which was later deemed a misdiagnosis by Dr.  Didn&#39;t go to work as I continued to  have difficulty walking and had headaches and overall weakness. Saw Dr. on April 20th.  Had to use wheelchair to attend the office visit and was given blood tests to see what was causing my condition. Had high blood pressure.  She also advised me to see a neurologist and heart doctor. ON April 20th had to go back to ER as I had the smae seizure like event!On April 22nd I visited Dr. office (heart doctor). Blood pressure was off on this day as well and I stayed at clinic until it was better. Was given a heart monitor to wear for 24 hours. Heart was fine after wearing the monitor. Visited Neurologist and was given EEG and CT CTA tests. All came back fine.

Symptoms became severe within 30 minutes thereafter, at which time I experienced difficulty standing. After five hours with no improvement, I used my home blood pressure monitor to check my BP and HR; BP was high for me, 120/90 sustained, and HR varied between 135 and 150, with 143 being the most consistent value after multiple readings. I seemed to be experiencing a &#34;severe allergic reaction&#34; per the instructions I was given and called 9-1-1. I was transported to Hospital, treated in ER, and then admitted to the intermediate care unit. I was discharged to home on 3-12-21.

                                                Within a few hours of receiving the vaccine, I started feeling nauseated. Since the day I took the vaccine, my appetite has been nonexistent. A day later, I felt very tired and confused. I received the vaccine on Monday and I woke up in a panic on Wednesday morning. My heart was racing, palms were sweaty, I felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe and it seemed like I was having a panic attack when I woke up. From that point forward, I fell into a deep depression. At first I didn&#39;t connect it with the vaccine, but I kept feeling nauseated and then wondered if it was connected. The depression became unbearable and I felt suicidal by the next week. I finally contacted my doctor&#39;s office and had a telemed visit where I explained that I had the J&amp;J vaccine the week before and these symptoms presented themselves afterward. The doctor put me on Zoloft and I HAVE been treated for depression in years past with that; however, I had not taken depression medication for about 8-10 years until this. Likewise, because my doctor put me on an anti-depressant, she also wanted me to see a counselor--which I have done. The medication is helping somewhat but I still don&#39;t have an appetite. I don&#39;t know if the vaccine had anything to do with the depression, but I wanted to report it just in case others have had similar symptoms.

Patient waited in waiting area and complained to her husband about feeling dizzy and might faint. Pharmacists went to aid the patient and lay her down gently, monitored her blood pressure which was high at the time, once patient sat up her BP decreased, it fluctuated the whole time, EMT was called and once they arrived and monitored her, they said the cause of her fainting was due to her blood pressure. Patient was alert and responsive the whole time. Patient was unsure if she took her BP medicine this morning.

Feeling as though I was being stabbed dead center of my chest and it came out my back.  I had trouble breathing or felt like it hurt more when I tried to take a deep breath. This was very severe for about 2 hours then eased off  and was off and on for about two days. My arm did not get sore until the third day after my vaccination and remains sore still. I?ve experienced a headache in severity ranging from a nuisance to temple throbbing since the day after vaccination.  I have taken my naproxen for the chest pain and headache.  I ran a temp of 99-100 occasionally but never for a long period of time.  I?m still experiencing some chest pain  occasionally but nothing as severe as  the first two days.

At the ER I was given IV fluids, chest xray, EKG and blood was drawn and I was released after a few hours of monitoring

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included high blood pressure and diabetes.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805029 expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 17-MAR-2021 at left arm for prophylactic vaccination.  No concomitant medications were reported.  On 17-MAR-2021, the patient had experienced headache after vaccination. On 27-MAR-2021, the patient began to experience intermittent pain on right leg. On 30-MAR-2021, she experienced headache again and was still having leg pain; she visited the Emergency Room (ER) and was admitted on 30-MAR-2021. On 02-APR-2021, the patient experienced clots on right leg. On APR-2021, a catheter was placed in catheterization procedure and her right leg vein was unclogged of a clot. A second clot did not require removal because the vein had already unclogged itself after medication. The patient was administered unspecified anticoagulants. She was discharged on 5-APR-2021 and was prescribed ticagrelor which was then changed to clopidogrel. On 18-APR-2021, the patient experienced a headache again and feeling of pressure on legs and hands. Patient was advised to visit ER. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from clots on right leg and intermittent pain on right leg on 02-APR-2021, recovered with sequelae from headache on 19-MAR-2021, and had not recovered from pressure on both legs and pressure on hands. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This 64 year-old Hispanic or Latino female with history of high blood pressure and diabetes was hospitalized for clots in her right leg 13 days after receiving the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. Concomitant medications were not reported. On the day of her vaccination, she experienced a headache. Ten days later, she began to experience intermittent leg pain. Three days later (ie, 13 days post vaccination), she went to the emergency room (ER) and was admitted to the hospital. During the hospitalization, a clot was removed via catheterization and she was administered unspecified anticoagulants. A second clot resolved on its own without surgical intervention. After 6 days in the hospital, she was discharged with ticagrelor which was later changed to clopidogrel. She recovered from the clots. Thirteen days after discharge, she began to experience headache and &#34;pressure&#34; in both legs and hands. She was advised to go to the ER; no further information was provided. Based on the limited information, the relationship of the serious events with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine is considered indeterminant. Additional information is being sought.

She stated that her sister received the J and J vaccine on 3/12/21 (confirmed in State vaccine system) at the hospital where she receives her oncology care.  She reported the following:  &#34;She had a massive stroke on MARCH 27TH, 2021 leaving her paralyzed on the right side with the inability to speak, swallow, or see. She was initially diagnosed with Ovarian cancer approximately three and one half years ago. She was chosen for a study with Pharmaceuticals and her diagnosis was changed to a vary rare form of cancer called clear cell carcinoma which originates in the gynecological area. She did have a previous stroke approximately three years ago, (just after original diagnosis) but she was on a different course of treatment at that time...Oncologists have explained that this most recent stroke event would not be considered a side effect of her current treatment routine. She wanted to bring it to the attention of the health department in case it needs to be looked at more closely by the J&amp;J research/scientific team. She passed away on 4/5/21. Her current treatment consisted of palliative chemo only. &#34;  Decedent was a resident but was vaccinated in another state. After the CVA she was brought to the hospital and subsequently transferred to the Medical Center where she died on 4/5/2021. Sister is willing to speak with any investigators if deemed necessary.

                                                Two days after my vaccine, on March 23 at approximately 2 AM, I had to call 911 because my heartbeat was rapid and irregular and had never happened before.   I was concerned it was a result of the vaccine because it was two days after the vaccine. An emergency vehicle came took me to the hospital and they said I had atrial  fibrillation and they had to reset my heart by jumping  it.  Very frightening.

The packing was removed on 4/23 with no more bleeding so far. I&#39;ve NEVER had nose bleeds! I was diagnosed with storage pool disease in 1992 which was reconfirmed in 2004. I had excessive bleeding during child birth in the late 80&#39;s.  I bruise easily and need medication or platelets with major surgery or trauma. No issues with dental or minor procedures. I had a TeleMed visit with Hematology today and well be having labs drawn early next week.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included Crohn&#39;s disease. The patient was previously treated with infliximab for Crohn&#39;s disease. The patient experienced drug allergy when treated with infliximab (Remicade). The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 042A21A, expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 31-MAR-2021 to left arm for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included vitamins nos, azathioprine, dicycloverine, and mesalazine for drug used for unknown indication.  On 22-APR-2021 by evening, the patient experienced right-sided mid-back pain and shortness of breath and was presented to ED (emergency department) on 23-APR-2021. The patient&#39;s pain was sharp and worsened with coughing and deep inspiration; she felt that she was taking shallow breaths. Upon ED (emergency department) presentation, there was no shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, fevers, dysuria, or abdominal pain. The patient had reproducible pain on her right mid-back area. There was some mild diffuse tenderness in her abdomen, but it was reported that she always had a tender abdomen due to Crohn&#39;s disease. The patient had no peritoneal signs and had no recent travel history. On 23-APR-2021, the CTA (Computed tomography angiography) of chest was done with and without contrast and found out central and peripheral pulmonary emboli in the right lower lobe. The patient had no CT (computerized tomography) evidence of right heart strain. The patient&#39;s ground glass opacities within the right lower lobe was somewhat band like in appearance and concerned for early pulmonary infarcts. It was reported that this might also relate to sub segmental atelectasis or less likely an inflammatory/infectious process. The patient had also small right pleural effusion; no acute inflammatory process in the abdomen or pelvis. On 23-APR-2021, the patient&#39;s platelet count was 252 k/mcL and was tested negative for covid test. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism; she consulted hematology/oncology specialist and recommended with initiation of argatroban for treatment of pulmonary embolism. The patient was admitted to inpatient on 23-APR-2021. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of pulmonary embolism/right sided mid back pain was not reported.

                                                Patient reported that she had a history of fainting after receiving other vaccines, so she had her friend drive her and got the vaccine administered in her car. A few minutes after getting the vaccine, the patient appeared to have a vasovagal episode where she stared off into the distance and stopped responding to questions for about 30 seconds to 1 minute before coming to. She reported having some tingling in her fingers and feeling a little weak afterwards. Provided the patient with a wet cloth for her forehead and some candy. Patient was a little shaken up but seemed to be back to normal in a few minutes. Contacted EMS just to be sure, and they checked her pulse and blood pressure, which were a little elevated but within normal limits. Patient said she was feeling better and did not need to go with them to the hospital. After waiting a few more minutes, she reported that she was feeling mostly back to normal and her friend drove them back home.

                                                I started to get Migraines the day of the shot. I was nauseous and I did have seizure which only happens twice a year. My seizures are not always triggered by migraine. I have a history of hives and I get reactions to bites. I decided to get the Johnson &amp; Johnson because it seemed to be a better option. Ten days after the vaccine I had a Migraine that was so bad I had to go to the doctor. When I got there my blood pressure was high. I was given some migraine medicine, but it did not help. The migraine was there for four weeks after the shot. I still got a numbing headache after the shot until five weeks after the shot.

The morning after the vaccine I felt lightheaded and weird. I had heart palpitations and I was queasy. I started to walk back to my bedroom. The next thing I knew I woke up on the floor after passing out. After that I felt like my body was crumpled and I was disoriented. I could barely walk but I made it to the couch, and I had bumps in the front and back of my head near my ear. I was in a lot of pain and I think I was in shock. My foot was painful, and I saw a foot doctor. I had a doctor?s appointment and they did an EKG and they sent me to a Neurologist. It has been seven weeks I still have dizziness and nausea and it is hard to focus. I also have pain in my knee and my right arm.

                                                I had about 20 min of being fuzzy headed. I couldn&#39;t remember the names of people I&#39;ve known all of my life, including my best friend and boss. I couldn&#39;t think of a town I had vacationed to. My daughter could tell by looking at me that something was wrong. My nephew took me to the ER. They CT Scan, EKG, COVID test, blood work and took my vitals. My BP was 196/84. They gave me IV meds to decrease my BP. They needed to do an MRI, so I was sent by ambulance. They didn&#39;t find anything new and my BP had gone down by that time. I was sent home around 4:30am. I was told to follow up with cardiologist and neurologist. I see the cardiologist on 6/14, but I can&#39;t get in with the neurologist until August. I was also instructed to rest and I&#39;m still pretty fatigued, so that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing.

She had a dentist APT on Thursday and they took her BP and it was very elevated, which she normally has a low BP.  Said it was 210/109 and thought it was the machine and retook it and it was again elevated at 206/104 (approximate #&#39;s).  She has subsequently taken it at home and it was still elevated yesterday was 142/80, then again on left arm was 146/89.  The most recent one this morning was 139/90.  She is a retired nurse, and knew to take it on the  opposite arm.  The dentist informed her to monitor her blood pressure.  She still has joint achiness from the vaccine and fatigue, not quite the pep that she had prior.    She took a diuretic last night and rechecked her BP this morning so her readings are after the diuretic.

                                                On the same day I got the vaccine and the next day, I had fever, body aches, and malaise; I was in bed for 2 days. I had a lack of energy that was worse than it had been before the vaccine. On or about 4/14/2021, I woke up at about 2:00AM with chest pain, pain in the left shoulder and in the left side of the neck. The symptoms subsided after some time. I had low oxygen saturation levels; I knew this, because I used a pulse oximeter that had been used by my late husband. The low oxygen saturation levels have been ongoing ever since, and I have had periods of rapid heart rate and oxygen levels that are even lower than the low levels I have experienced since the vaccine. I have also had periods of chest pains at times, so my PCP referred me to both a pulmonologist and a cardiologist.

Was still at Clinic so I went to Urgent care. I used my albuterol inhaler, chest tightness resolved. Treated in UC with solumedrol, famoditine, 1 liter NaCl. My allergist had me on 2 Zytec, and 2 famoditine the day of shot. Went to urgent care 7/5 for neuropathy. Saw neurologist on 7/8/21. Today is 12 days after the vaccination. My peripheral neuropathy is so bad I can&#39;t work. I have constant pain in my shoulder girdle, lower back thighs, calves, feet, hands, and visceral. My PCP won&#39;t give my any pain meds, my pain is 8/10.

About 10 hours  after, I started having an incredibly fast heartbeat that lasted for about 10 hours. I tried some breathing exercises to bring it down, but that did not work.  I did not seek medical care as it went back to normal throughout the morning of the following day.  But kind of scary.  Also had a low temperature of 98 on the scanner thermometer.  Normal is 96 something.

Then the patient became hypotensive 90/45, dizzy, and felt like she was going to pass out. She was laid in the supine position, given a cool cloth for her forehead and monitored for approx. 45 minutes. Her blood pressure remained 90/60, 96/56 at discharge. Her heart rate ranged from 55-65, regular. Her son came to take her home as we did not feel comfortable with the patient driving. The patient was continuously monitored by the NPs and APCT. She ambulated without difficulty and was discharged home. She was given information for V-safe to report her reaction and advised to follow up in the ER for any SOB, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, syncope, CP, etc.

                                                Since receiving the Johnson and Johnson Covid vaccine, my blood  pressure continued to go up each consecutive day. On Saturday, March 20, 2021 my blood pressure was 195/95. Obviously my husband took me to ER where I was given a prescription to hopefully lower my blood pressure. The medicine that I was give is Amlodipine. My blood pressure typically runs 120&#39;s over low 70&#39;s. I know this issue is not listed on your list of side effects. My husband has also experienced the same issue, just not to the extreme that it affected me. His has been up around 20 points.

His BP continued to rise a little each day and thought our machine was off,  Then I took mine about 3 days later and my BP was 158/83- higher than I ever remember it.  Usually it is about 118 over seventy something.    It was back to about 108 over seventy something 5 days after the vaccine.  I wasn&#39;t going to report it, but thought someone might want to know.

She saw PCP and had blood pressure medications adjusted to control hypertension, however, nosebleeds have persisted.  I have given her my personal cell phone number to call me immediately  and to go to Emergency Room if bleeding worsens or other problems arise such as sudden, severe headache.  (Patient states that blood flow contained clots for the first day or two, but has been flowing without clots each day at least and sometimes twice per day.  She is able to stop blood flow within 5 minutes by packing nostril each time.)  I have instructed patient to make appointment with ENT (Ear, Nose, Throat) Dr.

                                                The patient was given Janssen vaccine @ 11:38am. She stated she had anaphylaxis reaction before after colonoscopy was not sure exactly what from. Made sure this vaccine didn&#39;t have PEG in it. Asked her to stay for 30 minutes after vaccine so I could monitor her. Around 12:10pm she said her mouth felt like anaphylaxis may happen. Asked her if she felt like she could swallow she said yes gave her (2) 25mg diphenhydramine. Had her sit and took her blood pressure which was BP 202/101 hr 70 I asked her if maybe she was anxious she said no she was very calm. Around 12:20pm she said felt throat was closing like before told partner to call 911. Got out Epi pen 0.3mg but she had her own administered 1 dose in right thigh. Shortly after EMS arrived and took over. The whole time she was awake and alert and responsive. Spoke to her around 4pm she was just leaving ER and said she was doing better.

                                                Right away, they were watching me because I felt like my throat was tightening up a little bit. My blood pressure sky rocketed. Then I was okay after awhile. They pharmacist said to take some Benadryl when I got home if I needed it. He knew I had taken Claritin D earlier. I was okay though. But the next morning, I was so exhausted I could barely get out of bed. The next day, I was still really tired. On Sunday morning, 10th, it hit me - I woke up at 04:00 in am. Nauseous; light-headed; gastro-intestinal issues; extremely ill. I called my brother in and was afraid to be by myself. I could barely move around to even get water or go to bathroom.  I got through it somehow that day and on Monday I was just maybe a little but that isn&#39;t saying much - still severe. By Tuesday, I called the pharmacy - I was so light-headed I thought I was going to pass out and they told me to go to ER and someone took me and doctor said he was seeing a lot of this.  Gave me IV fluids. It was difficult to stay hydrated - they gave me paperwork on what to drink to stay hydrated - Pedialyte - anything that had water in it. I drank Essentia Water, too. I couldn&#39;t stay hydrated and I was so light-headed  (kept feeling like I was going to pass out) that I could have gone to ER again two days later. Doctor said take it easy - he said my body was busy making antibodies. That light-headedness for about a week - but I couldn&#39;t drive for two weeks because of it - was still so dehydrated. I had a strange sensation - like I was outside my body - I couldn&#39;t think straight. I was feeling pain in my back by my kidneys and went to my doctor.

                                                I had a number of strokes between April and May. As many as 9 of them. Memorial Day, 31st, I went to the hospital ER at 9:00PM. I had a PFO, which is something like Patent Forman Ovale, heart condition, hole in atrium of heart that causes the blood to go from heart to brain. Blood clots to the brain, venous blood gets into the arterial blood. The clots could have formed everywhere but they go straight up the brain. They went through an artery and put a mesh screen over my heart opening and eventually it will help that. It was done through an artery, 15 minute process. I left the hospital the following Saturday. This week (two days ago) I have really bad tinnitus starting in both ears. My hearing is quite disrupted. I don&#39;t know how serious it is right now. I am being treated with an anti-cholesterol drug (Lipitor) and aspirin. I still have a little bit of cognitive impairment and physical fatigue. My coordination is messed up. Physical therapy starts the 15th and Speech therapy on the 23rd. I had just gotten a job two weeks before the strokes.

Between 4/10 and 4/12, my fever reached 101.1. I had a dull headache and I had bone pain and joint pain; I felt like a walking skeleton. I felt like I could feel every joint connected to every bone. I was extremely sleepy and had no appetite. I was in a neurological fog. The days just went by, and I basically don&#39;t remember anything. I went to a cardiologist on 5/2/2021 and had a halter monitor put on; the results indicated an electrophysiological myopathy, second and third degree heart blockage, supraventricular tachycardia. The etiology to all of these is unknown. There was no afibrillation. I wore the monitor for 13 days.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Approximately six hours after administration of the vaccine, patient experienced sever chills and dizziness. Unable to stop shaking, patient took temperature which registered at 95.4F and then 95.1F at 15 minutes. Patient donned flannel pants, thermal shirt, and oversized hooded sweatshirt and got in bed under flannel sheets, two doubled-over blankets, a bedspread, and quilt. A down-filled king-size pillow was placed on top of patient&#39;s torso and a space heater was turned on to highest setting. Patient reports heart seemed to be racing, but did not take BP. Unable to quell the chills, the patient continued to shake, developing very stiff shoulders, neck and back as a result. This continued until approximately 2 am. The next morning, patient&#39;s temperature was registering at 99.4F and pulse was 96, but patient did not report chills. General muscle aches and mild headache were noted. At time of this report, patient&#39;s temperature and pulse are normal (97.6F and 76 pulse).

Later at night I had a low grade fever with achiness and headache. The flu like symptoms resolved by morning but I continue to have vertigo and intermittent nausea and my BP was still high in the morning around 9 am but came down by 12:45 to my normal range.  Paramedics at the site did a BP, pulse ox, blood sugar, ECG . Everything was normal except my BP which was 180/90.  This morning it was 167/98 and 168/97.  No treatment.  Saw my doctor&#39;s partner at 1:00 today and BP was back to my normal range but I still have mild vertigo and intermittent nausea.  Doc gave me some exercises to do for the vertigo and did not seem to think that it was related to the shot, but since the paramedics said they had seen a LOT of the same reaction yesterday to the J&amp;J shot and two sites in other cities shut down for the same reactions, nobody will convince me that it was anything but the shot. I expected the flu like side effects but never dreamed it would cause my  BP to spike and the vertigo.

I hardly slept. (all these not worrisome to me) I&#39;m so glad my vaccine provider warned me that with underlying conditions, the vaccine could make them flare up. Which they did. In the morning I had widespread pain all over. Severe headache, and shortness of breath. Because I already have near emphysema hypoxemia oxygen levels, I checked my Oximeter and my blood oxygen was in the dangerously low 70&#39;s.  It stayed there until I put my oxygen concentrator on. Monitoring oxygen levels all day, I was able to keep it in the 80&#39;s to 90&#39;s, which helped.  40 hrs after injection , symptoms already fading away. All my adverse events were related to underlying conditions responding to the inflammation of the immune response. I feel  protected, glad I had the oxygen handy,  and I feel great about the  J &amp; J vaccine!

                                                HPI Details: a 66-year-old female presenting today for evaluation of high blood pressure.  Patient notes that she went to the dentist on March 24 and was having a root canal revised.  She was told that she had very elevated blood pressure at that time, 173/81.  When they rechecked her blood pressure it had gone up even higher.  She was not feeling necessarily bad at that time but did start noticed that she was having some pounding headaches and felt like her heart was pounding out of her chest.  She has not really changed activity or diet.  She is not on any new supplements or over-the-counter meds that would cause this.  The only thing different was that she did receive the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine just prior to onset of this.  Patient was concerned about her blood pressure running so high, and she is a physician so she did prescribe herself some atenolol.  She took a couple of doses of this on March 29 when she received her blood pressure cuff in the mail from online store and was checking her blood pressure and found that her numbers were running quite high, such as 207/107.  She contacted our office.  I did go ahead and start her on lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily.  This did not make a significant improvement in her blood pressure.  We did go ahead and get lab work done.  CBC was unremarkable.  CMP notable for potassium 3.3 and alk phos minimally elevated at 129.  TSH was within normal limits.  Patient does bring in a log of her blood pressures with her today.  Again these are not really improving significantly with the lisinopril 10 mg daily.

                                                My mom had called saying she&#39;s feeling nausea, dizziness, drowsiness and vomiting. We called the emergency services when they arrived she had collapsed. They broke the window and took her to the hospital, upon arrival we were informed that she has got a hemorrhage possible clotting due to high blood pressure. I now know the term is Cerebral Hemorrhage, she has been in ICU on a ventilation machine while they tried to drain the blood and clots. She&#39;s currently out of ICU however still complains about headache and back pain. We are informed that she has now developed some blood pressure and diabetes however it could be cleared in the short term. She&#39;s at the hospital and unknown how long she would have to stay there.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s pre-existing medical conditions included the patient has chronic conditions like Patient Medical History of Hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, type II diabetes,  coronary artery disease with recent segment elevation myocardial infarction left anterior descending s/p Percutaneous coronary intervention, low ejection fraction 30% from 60% s/p single chamber 6/202. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 1805018, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 06-MAR-2021 10:29 for prophylactic vaccination.  No concomitant medications were reported. On 22-MAR-2021, the patient experienced swelling of legs, venous stasis ulcers, and thrombocytopenia. The patient on unspecified date was shifted in emergency room and later she was hospitalized. Number of days in hospital the patient was admitted was unknown. Laboratory data (dates unspecified) included: Blood pressure (NR: not provided) Moderate to severe pulmonary HTN, and Echocardiogram (NR: not provided) worsening EF- 15% from 30%m Moderate MR. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from swelling of legs, venous stasis ulcers, and thrombocytopenia. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: A 66 year old female, unspecified ethnicity, was diagnosed with venous stasis ulcers and thrombocytopenia 16 days after receiving the covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s. The patient went to the emergency room for the leg swelling (start date unknown) that was progressing over 2 days. Medical history includes hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and type II diabetes. Patient also has coronary artery disease with recent segment elevation myocardial infarction left anterior descending (STEMI LAD) s/p Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, low Ejection Fraction 30% (from 60%), s/p Single Chamber ICD. Concomitant medications not reported. Smoking history not provided. Echocardiogram revealed worsening EF - 15% from 30%, Moderate MR, Moderate to Severe Pulmonary Hypertension. Thrombocytopenia was reported without a reported platelet count. The patient was subsequently admitted to the hospital for unspecified number of days and was reported to have recovered from all events. Given the patient&#39;s extensive medical history, there is a plausible alternate explanation for swelling of legs and venous stasis ulcers, and there is limited information to make a meaningful assessment of the report of thrombocytopenia. Additional information is requested.

                                                On May 27th, I had an episode of double vision and light headedness and my blood pressure was up. Not quite confusion but just strange. They thought it might be a mini stroke - so I had an MRI or MRA - showed vascular changes but showed no acute stroke and carotids were okay. Also  did an EKG with some changes and a repeat  EKG - and that one seemed like a normal EKG.  I  had an echocardiogram - on Tuesday; Coronary CT on Wednesday and radiologist called my primary care doctor  and said there was a &#34;broken glass&#34; opaqueness (opacity) of left upper lobe. This Wednesday with the chest x-ray, I&#39;m concerned - I have been short of breath and tired lately - just not feeling good. On May 28th,  I started Lisinopril for blood pressure and also started aspirin.  My blood pressure is still fluctuating.  I&#39;m waiting for a lung CT to be scheduled - Pulmonary function study to be schedule and that&#39;s a couple of weeks out.  I haven&#39;t had another episode of double vision.  Fatigue and short of breath and I have had some diarrhea. I had had some weird GI stuff all winter long but it restarted (diarrhea) 2 weeks ago. I hadn&#39;t had it for four months or so.

                                                Instant headache and pain shooting down arm and side while being injected, sick feeling and light headed right as I was leaving the facility.  Within 4 hours I was struggling to do anything.  I was tired and felt and nauseated, light headed and felt like i was hit by a truck.  The bottoms of my feet hurt and I had stabbing pains so bad in my knee joints I could barely walk without assistance.  I felt very ill for about a week after the shot but the headaches continued constantly for over a month but aren&#39;t daily anymore even though I still have them, and the fatigue was getting worse and still is a problem to this day. Once I was feeling a bit better my right knee started to give out and my left knee was cracking. Since I got that vaccine on 3/6/21 I have had back to back problems.  Below is a quick list of these things that have occurred by dates: 3/30/21 - Constant headaches since the vaccine and ear pain and throat issues.  4/16/21 - Right knee giving out on me that started shortly after vaccine and gotten worse.  X-ray and physical therapy ordered.  4/22/21 - Shortness of breath, back pain, constant fatigue.  Blood work that showed elevated D-dimer then chest x-ray and ct-scan ordered. 4/26/21 - Ultrasound for nodule found on ct-scan. 5/4/21 - Biopsy done of mediastinal mass. 5/11/21 - Physical done for surgery. 5/24/21 - Surgery to remove mediastinal mass, right side of thyroid, two parathyroids and lymph nodes. 6/1/21 - Follow-up for surgery.  When I asked why this happened, the doctor said we may never know but the biopsy of the right thyroid nodule result showed thyroiditis, Autoimmune/Hashimoto&#39;s, and  that my immune system attacked my thyroid.  The doctor said she tested me for that in 9/20 and it was negative. 6/2/21 - Left knee pain.  About 4 days after my surgery on 5/24 i turned towards the door and heard a loud pop in my left knee.  It had been crackling since the vaccine but wasn&#39;t giving out like the right one. I couldn&#39;t walk on it at all and was using crutches.   6/9/21 - Mri on left knee showed medial and lateral meniscus tears.  Referred to Ortho Dr. 6/28/21 - Test thyroid levels post op.  TSH levels high.  Referral to Endocrinologist. 6/30/21 - Left knee treatment, cortisone shot in knee for now to help with pain and inflammation so I can function and physical therapy.  Since then my 4th toe on my right foot has been numb for almost two weeks.  I am scheduled for numerous future physical therapy appointments and doctors appointments.    Then to make matters worse I just heard 2 days ago that J&amp;J is having more issues and mentioned autoimmune and wondered could that be what caused all of this?   I regret getting that stupid J&amp;J vaccine.  I expected it to he the Pfizer because that is what was there 2 days before I got my shot.  I told the person I didn&#39;t want it and she got someone in charge to talk me into it.  I should have walked out of there and I am mad at myself for caving to this woman.  If J&amp;J says we need a booster I will refuse to take it.  I don&#39;t know if the vaccine was what triggered all of this but I find it quite odd that all of this started almost immediately after I got that vaccine.  Not only to me but also to my sister who got it at the same time.  She fell within 30 minutes of getting that vaccine and 3 more times that day, and has had and is still having numerous problems that mimic mine, such as issues with her feet and legs.  She struggles to walk and is having issues with her thyroid among other things that she wasn&#39;t having a problem with prior to the vaccine. This is just the short version of all I have been through.  Any questions feel free to contact me.

She then was given water.  She then became unresponsive, eyes closed, snoring with head slumped down while sitting.  After we realized patient could not be awoken, property manager called 911.  While ambulance was on thier way, patient &#34;woke up&#34; but was drowsy and could barely communicate.  No epinephrine or diphenhydramine was administered.  BP was 130/100.  After EMS arrived, patient&#39;s partner came in from the car and reported this has happened multiple times at doctor appointments/procedures.  Patient was unconscious for around 5minutes.  Patient reported she went to the ED but was discharged after a short visit.

Body aches lasted three weeks. Fever lasted about 4 days. No appetite, diarrhea. Sill lack of appetite and run down and nothing tastes good. The fatigue is lingering. The breathing and low oxygen levels are still causing problems since the first dose.

                                                15-20 minutes after the injection, I started feeling a tightness in back of my throat; I broke out in cold sweat. I started getting dizzy and very whoozy. I felt my vision starting to close in. I thought I was going to pass out. I got the attention of the person across me to get an attendant and they brought me a chair with wheels. Two people got me up (and I&#39;m not a big person) - they were worried I was going down and I was taken to exam room. They said I was white as a sheet. She checked my eyes and throat a few times and checked my blood pressure. It was lower than normal but she didn&#39;t seem really concerned about it - 104 over 60 something which is low for me. She gave me water to sip. She gave me very cold compresses to put on my forehead. They watched me pretty good. She had the epi-pen ready. She watched me and I sat in there and nurse came in a quite a few times to check me for about an hour. About an hour later the tightness went away and I started feeling myself again. We went home. I went to sleep. I woke up at night to go to bathroom and I was still a little woozy but I didn&#39;t fall. Next day, I just didn&#39;t feel well. My left arm was starting to hurt - was no swelling; it was a little red at injection site. It hurt just a little. I was woozy. My eyes couldn&#39;t focus as well. I felt out of it. I drank a lot of water and took a nap.  Yesterday, I felt pretty decent but still woozy somewhat. I tried to run errands with my husband  - just wasn&#39;t quite right. Today, much better but I&#39;m not quite myself yet. Just a little wooziness - weird feeling. Yesterday, I did feel a soreness in the back of my right calf muscle. It wasn&#39;t warm to the touch or swollen. I don&#39;t have it anymore, it went away.  It could have been a muscle thing from the first day of the vaccine when I got home and I got up and almost fell down. I do still have some achiness in joints. Especially in my knees - which isn&#39;t normal because they are replaced.

My chest felt a little funny. about 9am my face was really red, I got my BP checked 188/85 Oxygen was good and Dr said  to take benadryl and took two right away and I took 2 more after 6 hours, symptoms subsided that evening. My BP stayed high and I felt not good, I had pressure in my chest and some pressure on the left and right side of my breast,  BP was 177 at 4pm. I went home to bed I woke up with pressure again in my chest. I went to the Dr and he said come back in two weeks and see how you are, I went in this last monday and he put me on medication for high blood pressure

                                                Prior to vaccination, the patient stated that she was nervous, but seemed relieved and okay directly following the vaccination.  Following vaccination, patient became restless during the 15 minute post-vaccination window about 2-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  She initially presented with uncontrollable shaking/bouncing legs, palpitation, sweating, and shortness of breath (though this was very brief.   Patient remained coherent and oriented to time/person/place.   The shaking and palpitations subsided after a couple minutes and resumed towards the end of the 15 minute waiting period, accompanied by nausea.  25 minutes post-vaccination she appeared to have stabilized, and we assisted the patient to her room nearby at her request to allow her to lie down while being monitored.  After returning to her room, she very quickly ran to her sink due to her nausea, then after a minute of attempting to vomit, she collapsed and appeared to have briefly lost consciousness.  EMS was called and the patient was rolled onto her side to prevent choking in the event of emesis.  Patient remained responsive, but was weak and clammy with a weak pulse and breathing.  After the firefighters came, a search of the apartment found the previously listed medications.  Additionally, the patient experienced a seizure-like episode lasting 15 seconds in duration.  Once the EMT came, they assessed her and monitored her in the ambulance; they reported that her condition appeared stable, her vitals were strong, and transported her to Hospital for observation/testing.

My heart rate stayed at 109 or more until 10 PM the next night when its slowly went down to a normal heart rate.  At 3 am  (12 hours after the shot) i had  a blinding debilitating headache that lasted until 9pm the next night.   It also affected my vision.   The headache was so bad i could not concentrate on the simplest task.  I  was unsure of what i could take for the headache.   So, I did not take anything.    When i woke up i was very tired and this lasted until the following day.  6am i had a fever of 102.3 this went down to 100.4 at 9:15 pm that night.  I also had chills for several hours. 9:20 AM  the nausea started followed by vomiting and dizziness.   This only lasted for a few hours.    I  experienced very vivid dreams the night of the shot.    I only drank some coconut water all day and could not eat any food.  The next day Saturday March 27 i felt better but the fatigue did not go away until late in the evening.   Sleeping seemed to help but i could only sleep for 2- 3 hours at the most.

She felt well enough to leave the pharmacy on her own after 25-30 minutes.  The  patient had a prior history of anxiety prior to receiving vaccinations and was very nervous about getting the vaccination prior to administration.  The patients daughter was with her and felt that her symptoms were due to anxiety about  getting vaccinated, but later called the pharmacy asking to report the adverse events as being related to receiving the vaccine.  It is not known weather or not the symptoms are directly related to the vaccine.

Dizzyness, with vision looking 2D and flat by 15 minutes. Told Pharmacist, of spaciness who said stay as long as I wanted. Left at 30 minute point, still spacy and nauseous. Spaciness ended by an hour with nausea off and on. Chest pain - began around 7pm, continued to expand in area of chest, sharp stabbing pain later, pain from just above left elbow to hand and tingling of fingers, pain lower left leg and tingling of left foot. Irregular heart rate at different times. Checked into emergency room at 11:00. IV inserted, placed on continual heart and oxygen monitors, EKGs, chest X-rays (2), blood tests (3). Admitted to hospital sometime during the night. Given IV medications to counteract IV contrast allergy. These medications caused full body shakes, eyesight auras and extreme nausea with gagging. Heart CT taken with IV contrast. Discharged around 3:00 PM.

Patient was found to have a right parietal multifocal parenchymal hemorrhage measuring 19x36x37mm and small right temporal lobe SAH. Subsequent CTA showed thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus and the right frontoparietal cortical veins as well has nonocclusive thrombus of right transverse and sigmoid sinus. The patient was also noted to have focal seizure of mouth and tongue and was loaded with phosphenytoin. After discussing case with neurology, nuero IR, NSGY and family it was decided to transfer the patient to sunrise for close monitoring and consideration of cerebral venous sinus thrombectomy if she worsens. I had a long discussion with multiple sisters about the risks of anticoagulation with argatroban given the IPH but the necessity given the cerebral venous thrombosis. I also discussed that argatroban is not readily reversible and that heparin is contraindicated if there is concern about vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia due to possible PF4 ab related to HIT. The patients VITT modified 4T score is 4 and she is intermediate risk for this being VITT. #Right parietal IPH, right temporal SAH and Superior saggital sinus thrombosis with nonocclusive thrombus of right transverse and sigmoid sinus -concern for vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia given johnson and johnson vaccine 2 days prior -modified VITT 4T score of 4- intermediate -send fibrinogen, d dimer, consider IVIG 1gm/kg per day for two days if high dimer, low fibrinogen and falling platelets -will start argatroban, avoid heparin until HIT ab (PF4) is resulted, if HIT positive avoid heparin -neuro IR consulted for possible IR intervention if worsens -transfer accepted by sunrise ICU, appreciate transfer for IR evaluation -continue phosphenytoin -SBP goal &lt;150 with nicardipine and esmolol gtts -monitor daily fibrinogen, dimer, coags #AKI- monitoring uop and cr, consider renal US if worsens #DM- ISS #HTN- nicardipine and esmolol gtts for SBP &lt;150, target 140 Patient seen, examined, labs and imaging reviewed, agree with resident note

                                                From the April 4, 5, 6 I felt very dizzy and out of it. When I got home on the 4th of April I had a metallic taste in my mouth and I started to feel pain in my chest. On my right side, center of my chest and the left side of my chest is where I felt pain. It was the worst pain I felt in my life, I took Tylenol. I called my doctor the next day 4/5/21 and she told me take off for 2 days per protocol for J&amp;J vaccines.  I did have a fever on 4/5/21On the 7th of April I had to stop working because my headaches were so bad. The doctor ordered new nebulizer kits for me, I was just using those. My doctor told me not take anything else except for Tylenol. I was having trouble breathing so I went to ER on the 20th of April, they ran tests (xray, blood). Since the ER visit, I have not been able to work full time. I have been feeling very unwell, breathing issues and a bad cough. I have been sick again since 6/2/21,  I was given antibiotics and I have also been prescribed prednisone. The prednisone has made a huge difference, I was able to start working more. Once off the prednisone, I started to feel bad again. Since getting my COVID 19 vaccine, I have not been able to work a full work week.

They sent me home and told me to check up with my doctor. Did some more blood work later and a thyroid checkup and everything came back fine.

Patient was not able to speak English so her fried translated to her. She was able to talk and responding to her friend&#39;s questions. I gave her Benadryl liquid to see if it resolves. After 5 minutes or so she complained of having chest tightness and having hard time breathing. I immediately gave her EpiPen 0.3mg injection in left thigh.  After few minutes patient said he is feeling better with chest tightness but still having feeling of throat closing. at this time, I had one of my tech call 911 and provided another EpiPen injection (about 5 minutes after the first one).  Police showed up in approximately 5 minutes.  EMT showed up 10 minutes after them.  Patient was conscious the entire time.

On 09-JUN-2021 (one week later), the patient returned for a second ultrasound to make sure the clot did not get any bigger and no improvement was noted. The patient was prescribed oral Aspirin 325 mg, 1 tablet, twice a day (BID) by the doctor. On 29-JUN-2021, the patient stated that she felt better. However, on the same day, a third ultrasound was performed by the ultrasound technician who noticed no improvement. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from superficial blood clot in right leg, upper thigh and varicose veins.

She walked over to the chair, sat down, within 5 minutes her husband alerted us that she had fainted and if the pharmacy staff could help her. Staff then proceeded to lay her down on the ground where a cooler was placed under her feet to keep them elevated, a cushion was placed under her head for comfort, and she was given a bottle of water when she became alert. She then rested for a few more minutes before getting up in her chair again. She then got in the chair after 10 minutes, waited another 20 minutes and then felt safe enough to go home afterwards.

                                                Patient is a 69-year-old female with past medical history of coronary artery disease status post double bypass on May 2015, hypertension, hyperlipidemia came to emergency room with chief complaint of chest pain going on since Wednesday.  She says that initially the pain started after she ate her food and she has history of gallbladder polyp and hence she thought it might be her gallbladder and indigestion and took Tums.  Pain was associated with nausea at that time.  Her pain recurred next day after eating and she took nitroglycerin after which she felt better.  But today she tried to hurt just toast and nectarine for breakfast after that she had pain again in the middle of the chest and this is when she got worried and she came to the emergency room.  She denied any shortness of breath or vomiting or diaphoresis associated with the pain.  She says that her previous heart attack, she did not have any symptoms.  In the emergency room, her troponin was elevated and given EKG findings of subtle ST changes, code heart was called and cardiology evaluated the patient and canceled code heart as her EKG was pretty stable.  She received a dose of aspirin and Brilinta in emergency room and was started on heparin drip. NSTEMI. Cardiac Catheterization performed.

                                                2 different events: 1) 20-30 minutes after the shot, I felt dizzy and disoriented, similar to car-sickness, but I wasn&#39;t in a moving vehicle; It appeared that the center of the field of vision for my left eye had become blurred. Subsequently, I had a bad headache and body aches, which lasted most of that day and the next day. My vision is still blurred. A visit to my optician on 13 April 2021 confirmed an epi-retinal membrane, which was not present at my previous eye exam.  2) about two weeks after the shot, I experienced severe pain and raised blood vessels in different areas of both my fore arms, hands and fingers, and my lower left leg and left foot. These lasted a few minutes and then subsided. They were severe enough to wake me up multiple times every night. I finally went to my doctor&#39;s office on April 26, saw the nurse practitioner who actually watched one of these episodes. She consulted Dr., they were only concerned about my left leg being a potential blood clot; said the other areas were unlikely to cause significant problems, sent me for an ultrasound examination of my left leg on April 27th, which showed no blood clot. The intermittent raised veins and pain continued for another week or so then subsided.

                                                69 YO female received one dose of J&amp;J vaccination on 3/12/21.  4/8: Patient complaint of epigastric abdominal pain almost nightly since March 12 (coincided with her COVID vaccination) described as 10/10, crampy and without radiation. CT abdominal and pelvis with contrast showed infiltrating mass in the left hepatic lobe concerning for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma with reactive adenopathy. Additionally, left mid ovarian vein thrombus found. No thrombus in the renal veins or IVC. 4/28: Venous duplex demonstrated bilateral leg acute DVT. Eliquis was started. 5/7: Pt underwent laparoscopic biopsy/paracentesis. Eliquis was held 2 days prior to laparoscope...5/11: Pt presented to hospital with complaints of generalized weakness, fatigue and leg pain. CTPA showed bilateral PE. Pt received heparin drip and was switched back to Eliquis on discharge. Echocardiogram on 5/12 noted mobile round mass in RV junction, right atrial mass; presumed to be a thrombus. Pt additionally with elevated troponin, determined to likely demand ischemia related to PE; EKG without any acute changes. Discharged on 5/24. 5/27: Patient started on chemotherapy with gemcitabine/cisplatin for metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.  6/4: Presented to the ED again due to worsening dyspnea and home pulse ox readings in the 70s. CT chest showed moderate burden of bilateral obstructive pulmonary emboli with no overt RV strain. EKOS and clot retrieval was contraindicated d/t thrombocytopenia. Was noted to have demand ischemia, and transitioned from eliquis to heparin gtt. Vascular was consulted for eval of her ischemic right foot, and deemed that it needed amputation, but would be a high risk surgery.  6/8: Patient was transferred to this reporting institution for second opinion requested by the family. Upon arrival, patient was found to be obtunded and hypotensive requiring heated high flow nasal cannula and vasopressor with norepinephrine. Code status was deemed DNRCCA/Do not intubate per family. Bedside ultrasound was concerning for an LV mass. Cardiology and Vascular surgery were consulted and recommended that the foot be amputated as well, but requested further workup with ECHO and CTA chest/abdomen/pelvis to further evaluate the LV mass. During admission workup, she was incidentally found to be COVID PCR positive. She was started on DEXA-ARDS prednisone dosing, remdesivir, and placed in enhanced droplet isolation.  Her hospital course was complicated by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to pulmonary emboli, COVID-19 infection, and underlying malignancy requiring heated high flow nasal cannula. Empiric cefepime was started to treat any underlying superimposed pneumonia. Due to extensive clot burden with limb ischemia, as well as &#43; COVID, she was systemically anticoagulated with a heparin drip despite her thrombocytopenia. She was intermittently given platelet transfusions in order to keep platelet count &gt;30. TTE was obtained on 6/11 which showed large masses in right ventricle and right atrium, vegetations on mitral valve, aortic valve, and tricuspid valve, and probable mass in IVC. She also developed AKI with oliguria related to shock and critical illness. Medical oncology was consulted and she unfortunately was not a candidate for further chemotherapy at the time due to critical illness, as well as ischemic limb. (If further treatment was pursued, she would need a left leg amputation, then would require 4-6 weeks of recovery before additional chemotherapy could be given.) She slowly became more encephalopathic and had increased oxygen requirements, requiring continuous heated high flow nasal cannula. Goals of care were discussed with her family. Given her advanced cancer, it was decided to transition to comfort-focused care. Her code status was changed to DNRCC. Symptoms were controlled with IV pain and anxiety medication. She expired on 6/13/2021 at 0225.

Because of the headache, I had the pharmacist take my BP. Upper palate was scratchy and irritated. Took 25 milligram tablet of Benedryl. Throat getting tighter but no shortness of breath. At 4:00 BP was 164/104, pulse still 100. At 4:00 took another 25 mg of Benedryl. BP remained high. Stayed for an hour. Turned down epi-pen because her breathing was fine. 5:15 BP still 164/104. Left site and started feeling itchy-- eyelids, lip, scalp. 7:00 BP had come down. 148/94, pulse 88; headache persisted. Took 650 mg of aspirin. 9:00 headache had lessened and BP was 138/80, pulse was 84. By 10:00, moderate headache. Slept. Woke up at 12:00 am with muscle pain in right leg. 3:30 am woke with bad headache, chilled, slight fever (99.6), rash on right trunk and upper abdomen.

The patient&#39;s height and weight were not reported. The patient was not pregnant at the time of event reporting.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 1802070, expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, administered on right deltoid muscle on 09-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 10-MAR-2021, the patient had a planned surgery (decompression fusion).  On 13-MAR-2021, the patient had a horrible pain and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed that she had large spinal hematoma. On 15-MAR-2021, hematoma was drained &#34;(3 units of blood)&#34;. At the time of this report, the patient still had a little bump and her platelets dropped from 14 to 7. The patient was discharged on 21-MAR-2021; treatment details were not provided. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient was recovering from large spinal hematoma, and the outcome of platelets dropped from 14 to 7 was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0 This report concerns a 70-year-old female patient who had a spinal hematoma, 3 days after a planned surgery and 4 days after receiving Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.  One day after vaccination, the patient had the planned decompression fusion. Three days after surgery (4 days after vaccination), the patient had a severe pain and MRI revealed a large spinal hematoma. Two days after, hematoma was drained (&#34;3 units of blood&#34;).  Patient&#39;s platelet counts dropped from &#34;14 to 7&#34; (unit not specified). The patient was discharged from the hospital six days later.  Although spinal surgery is the risk factor for hematoma, based on the close temporal relationship, the causality for the events is considered plausible for vaccine. Additional information has been requested.

In the emergency room labs remarkable for platelet count 92, INR 1.0, glucose 170, GFR 70.7, AST  48, alkaline phosphatase 167, troponin I 0.039.  COVID-19 and other viral serologies not detected.   CT of the brain showed a small subacute infarct in the right body of the corpus callosum. MRI  advised by radiology. Patient received aspirin, amlodipine 10 mg, enalapril 1.25 mg IV then 0.625  mg IV for uncontrolled hypertension.  MRI of brain reveals small subacute infarct involving the body of the  corpus callosum, and punctuate acute infarct to the posterior left frontal lobe.  Angiogram of brain was performed revealing focal severe stenosis of the mid basilar artery, moderate to severe stenosis of the short segments of both intracranial internal carotid  arteries and moderate to severe short-segment stenosis of the intracranial left vertebral artery, felt to be chronic and unrelated to current symptoms. She was started on dual antiplatelet therapy: clopidogrel  75 mg PO DAILY and   aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (Dr/Ec)  81 mg PO DAILY.  It should be noted that lab work reveals Thrombocytopenia chronically from 2011 forward.

On 04/06 She passed out while sitting in her chair, woke up and began throwing up. Had extreme short term memory loss and low blood pressure. On 04/08 while at her primary care Dr, he suggested a hospital visit with suspicion of possible stroke.  Was admitted  and released the following day. Dr advised possible mini strokes but could also be dehydration.  CBC with differential showed other results than dehydration.   Starting around 04/20 she started having chest pains and thought it was heart burn, after medication and another visit to her pcp she was admitted to the hospital again on 04/23.  Her troponin levels indicated a possible heart attack.  She had a heart catherization and was found to have a healthy heart.  Again, her blood pressure has been decreased since, her hgb and hct has also been low with a history of it being high.  A high WBC since all of this has started among other unexplained blood results.

                                                I had an event where my blood pressure was very high and the left side of my body became tingly and weak.  I went to the doctor and stayed two nights for observation.  They ran many diagnostic tests but nothing was diagnosed.  I continued to have the tingling and weakness and began to feel it could be a pinched nerve in my back/shoulder.  I went to a chiropractor and was treated twice for adjustments to my back, neck area and the tingling, weakness has not occurred again.  I am monitoring my blood pressure at home and have a doctor check up scheduled for the end of this month.  Confident it was not a medical event due to the Covid vaccine but still following up.

Symptoms of headache with visual disturbances and abdominal pain began less than 2 weeks later. She presented to the ED about 4 to 5 weeks after the vaccine with chest pain, abdominal pain, and hemoptysis.    Work up identified right sided central and bilateral segmental pulmonary emboli, with splanchnic circulation thrombosis of the upper segment of the superior mesenteric vein, splenic vein, main portal vein, and intrahepatic portal veins, as well as dural sinus thrombosis.  The patient was thrombocytopenic with elevated heparin pf4 antibody. She was initially started on heparin, but transitioned to argatroban and IVIG, with resultant increase in platelet counts over the course of her stay. She was also started on Diamox 250 BID for increased IOP.  The patient was hypoxic on room air, requiring up to 4L of oxygen during her stay, but was down to 1L at the time of discharge. She was discharged on rivaroxaban for continued anticoagulation.

Within a week after vaccine, experienced swollen ankles, muscle at joints pain, heart muscle pain. I already had Covid in Feb 2020, after the normal 2-3-week cold/sinus /coughing in bed watching tv, and was totally fine after. I only got the JnJ shot to go to an event in June requiring it, but wish I hadn&#39;t! My natural immunity was probably compromised by the vaccine. Being on Humira for previous 10 years (another mRNA-style maintenance drug), probably complicated/worsened my current post-vaccine symptoms. Humira website says the combo isn&#39;t tested yet.

                                                about two hours after injection,  I experienced headache,  then mild dizziness,  then extreme dizziness,  then sudden overwhelming fatigue,  then swollen eyes and eyelids,  then chills and elevated heart rate,  with pounding.    I had to cancel the class I was supposed to teach,  because I would not have been safe to drive to campus.  I slept from approximately 2:30 pm on March 8 until 8:30 am today,  March 9,   all symptoms continuing,  with bathroom breaks, a couple of short reports to family members who were watching out for me,  and one  2-hour window during which I ate a small meal,  went back to bed,  and read part of a book.    During bathroom breaks I took more antronex,  some milk thistle,  and some glutathione,  which seemed to at least temporarily reduce dizziness and eye/eyelid swelling.  At one point I took some hawthorne tincture because I was concerned about the heart pounding.    Today I woke up feeling symptom-free,  but by 2 pm I was compelled by sudden fatigue to take a two-hour nap.   After that I felt better,  and I think I am now fine,  at 7:45 pm on 3/9/21.    I am happy to have gotten the Janssen vaccine,  because it is one and done!

A second cool pack was administered until she next reported feeling cold and chilly, with shakiness.  She mentioned that her abdomen also felt cold, which was strange.  EMS arrived and transported patient approximately 30 minutes post administration.

The patient also showed her hives to her physician and she was told to keep putting Benadryl on it. The patient had a follow up with her physician on 03-MAY-2021 for her arm checkup. On an unknown date in APR-2021 (reported as first night), she could see penguins walking around, marching up the stairs on first night (Hallucinations) and then no more penguins after the first night. On the same first night, the patient experienced nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. On an unknown date, the patient experienced wheezing and she thinks that her wheezing was not related to the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. According to patient her wheezing is related to her asthma. The patient did not have any trouble sleeping since she was taking the Benadryl. The patient stated that she could move her arm up and down, but she was scared to do so. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from hallucinations, bladder infection/abdominal pain to groin, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea, and the outcome of almost passed out, hives on neck, couldn&#39;t touch the arm, blood clot inside the bump (injection site), wheezing, could hardly walk, injector pulled the needle back and put it in again and redness is still as big as a baseball was not reported. The reporter considered the causality between Covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s and wheezing, and bladder infection as not related. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: 20210452551-covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s- blood clot inside the bump (injection site), hallucinations. This event(s) is considered unassessable. The event(s) has a compatible/suggestive temporal relationship, is unlabeled, and has unknown scientific plausibility.

Carotid ultrasound showed thrombosis of the right common and internal carotid arteries and right carotid siphon. She was found down, last seen normal 2 days prior to admission. She was not a candidate for tPA given the delayed presentation and unlikely to benefit from  thrombus extraction. She was treated with aspirin and atorvastatin and treated for rhabdomyolysis. Patient is currently still admitted to the hospital but transitioning to comfort focused care.

                                                Patient called Thursday around 2 pm and asked if it was normal to hurt all over.  I told her muscle pain could be an adverse effect.  The patient then said she felt that her blood pressure was up and felt as though a mack truck was on her chest.  I instructed her to go to the ER.

                                                Around 5:30 pm on Friday night, I started feeling really cold; couldn&#39;t get warm for 2 hours. Then I started getting a fast heart rate; checked this around 7 pm; BP was 181/80 and heart rate was 135.  I was starting to feel warm along with being cold.  I had a gradually increasing temperature; checked it around 8:30 pm; was 102.1; took 2 tylenol and temperature slowly started going down.  My heart would not slow down; I sat in my recliner and kept deep breathing and had calming herbal tea; was afraid to go to the ER due to Covid.  After more than 4 hours with a racing heart, I felt exhausted and laid down around 12:30 a.m. and fell asleep.  I woke around 3 am with nausea and soaking wet pajamas from sweating.  I fell asleep again and woke around 7 am; I felt very tired, woozy and my heart hurt.  I felt a bit more normal after a few days.  I still feel a bit dizzy and light headed.  I was concerned when I later heard some J&amp;J vaccines were contaminated; on 4/2/21, I called the pharmacy because the number they wrote on my card, 1805D18 wasn&#39;t clear; they told me this # was incorrect and should be 037A21B and couldn&#39;t explain why this was so. They were going to check into  this and call me; I called them again on 4/5/21 and was told the correct # was 043A21A and that the vaccine was from the Netherlands.  They couldn&#39;t offer any more information or explain why the initial # was incorrect. I find this concerning and have been unable to find an answer.

Massive headache by Monday and ringing in ears.  Took Naproxin and Mucinex Monday morning before going to work.  At the end of the day I took Naproxin and Mucinex in order to sleep.  By Tuesday I had chest congestion which has gotten only worse along with needle-like pain in the chest upon coughing. I spit up yellow phlegm, tiredness behind eyes returned, sneezing, choking on phlegm, and constant runny nose and ringing in ears.  This has made working difficult, but not impossible.  Please ignore if these are normal reactions.  I&#39;m just not sure.

Initial information was processed along with additional information received on 04-JUL-2021, 08-JUL-2021 and 09-JUL-2021. The patient&#39;s weight was 64.86 kilograms, and height was 165 centimeters. No past medical history or concurrent conditions were reported. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1802072 and expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total administered to upper left arm on 11-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported. On 16-MAR-2021, (5 days after vaccination) the patient had a strong reaction to the vaccine and experienced headaches, dizziness, nausea, and weakness which persisted for several weeks. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced high blood pressure and started using losartan, and metoprolol from 30-MAR-2021 as treatment. On 22-JUN-2021, the patient&#39;s physician got tested her for the spike protein immunoglobulin G (IgG Antibody) test and its results came negative (confirmed immunological vaccine failure). The patient wanted to know whether it was okay to get another vaccine as a booster dose to boost her immunity because she felt if she did not do that, she would be at risk of catching a virus. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from dizziness, headaches, nausea, and weakness, had not recovered from blood pressure high, and the outcome of confirmed immunological vaccine failure was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition). This report was associated with a product quality complaint: 90000185416. The suspected product quality complaint has been confirmed to be not voided (meet pqc criteria) based on the PQC evaluation/investigation performed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0 - 20210710887-COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S -Confirmed Immunological Failure. This event(s) is considered not related. The event(s) has a compatible/suggestive temporal relationship, is unlabeled, and has unknown scientific plausibility. There are other factors more likely to be associated with the event(s) than the drug. Specifically: SPECIAL SITUATIONS

                                                BLOODY NOSE; BELL&#39;S PALSY; This spontaneous report received from a patient concerned a 73 year old female patient. The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included carotid surgery on 12-MAR-2021.  The patient received vaccination with JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE (covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s) (suspension for injection, route of admin intramuscular, batch number: 042A21A, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered to left arm on 02-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulfate for blood thinner. The patient reported no other symptoms or side effects after the vaccine.  Around 07-APR-2021, patient started getting Bell&#39;s palsy and went to the Emergency Room (ER) because she thought she was having a stroke. The patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy. The patient followed up with primary care provided on 12-APR-2021. Patient&#39;s Bell&#39;s palsy was not recovered completely but was almost gone. The patient had bloody nose on 13-APR-2021 and went to urgent care. The patient was told not to worry about it and &#39;it will probably never happen again&#39;.  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from bleeding from nose, and was recovering from bell&#39;s palsy. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This 73-year-old female patient experienced medically important Bell&#39;s palsy 5 days after receiving JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE (covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s) intramuscularly to left arm for prophylactic vaccination. The patient&#39;s had carotid surgery 21 days prior to the vaccination. Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulphate. The patient reported no other symptoms after the vaccination. She started to get Bell&#39;s palsy symptoms 5 days post vaccination and visited emergency room. She was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy. Details of symptoms, diagnosis, treatment were not reported. She followed up with primary care provider 10 days post vaccination and was seen with Bell&#39;s palsy &#34;almost gone&#34;. She was recovering from Bell&#39;s palsy. The patient experienced non-serious bloody nose the next day and had recovered.  Although information is limited, as there is no confirmatory epidemiologic/biologic evidence that vaccinations cause/contribute to the development of Bell&#39;s palsy, and the most common causes include viral infection and diabetes, the event is assessed to have an indeterminate causal association to immunization, per WHO causality classification for adverse events following immunization. Company causality for Bell&#39;s Palsy is considered not related to JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE.  Additional information has been requested for further assessment.

I hit the deck causing contusions to my knees and upper back.  I regained consciousness after _about 10 seconds, was helped up another flight of stairs by a friend and neighbor where I - again -  blacked out falling to the hallway floor.  I regained consciousness in another 10 seconds.

Upon evaluation the patient had persisting tachypnea and orthopnea, She was referred for a stat echocardiography and found to have significant pericardial effusion with tamponade. From the echocardiography department, she was referred urgently to the emergency department and taken urgently to the cardiac catherterization suite where she underwent fluoroscopy-guided pericardiocentesis with drainage of about 360mL of bloody effusion, Pericardial drain was left in place. In total it apperas that approximately 400mL of fluid was removed over the course of the patients hospitalization from the pericardial catheter. The catheter was removed on the afternoon of 05/12/2021 without difficulty. On the date of discharge it was noted that she had mild increase of dyspnea, a chest x-ray was obtained which revealed a right pleural effusion and a questionable infiltrate in the left base. The patient did not endorse any symptoms of cough and she had no wheezing and clinically did not have evidence of infectious pneumonitis at the time of discharge.

The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 043A21A expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 total, administered to the left arm on 05-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported. On an unspecified day, the patient had a horrible headache for 4 weeks and went into the hospital and did bloodwork. She stated that her platelet count went down to 69,000 and liver enzymes were high. She also had a head computerized tomography (CT) scan done as well as went to the eye doctor. Two weeks later the patient went and had another platelet count done and it went up to low normal. She wondered if a month after the vaccine, it was possible to have the side effects. She also stated that she had severe nausea along with the headaches. She also had joint aches as well as body aches. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient was recovering from low platelet count, and the outcome of liver enzymes high, horrible headache, severe nausea, joint aches and body aches was not reported.

What happened next, I had gone to ENT for my ear (5th) and he put me on heavy dose of Prednisone (6th). Following Tuesday, I was on Prednisone for ear. I was already really achy by then. On the third day after the Prednisone I fatigue, headaches and neck pain but I didn&#39;t have any other pain. I still couldn&#39;t hear though.  I was on this for almost 4 weeks and from them I started like I was having a hot flash and then I would get cold; sore throat; headaches heavy bones and achy muscles; earaches; fatigue; dizziness like you wouldn&#39;t believe. They were cyclical - I&#39;d have them for a couple days and then for about a half a day I&#39;d be a bit better and then it would start up again. The fatigues and dizziness didn&#39;t change when the other symptoms seemed to be a bit better. My hearing didn&#39;t start to clear until I went to see the 2nd ENT which was a couple of weeks down the road. I do not have the stamina I had before the vaccine - I&#39;m not sleeping well at night and I&#39;m always short of breath at any exertion. It is improving but it&#39;s slow. Again, the symptoms I experienced during cyclical times: Cold symptoms, runny nose, sore mouth, ringing in my ears was horrible; dizziness and short of breath - cyclical for three weeks. The Prednisone took away all my cramps and pain in my joints that I had before the vaccine. Currently: My heart feels like it&#39;s going 100 miles an hour at night in bed - chest discomfort at night. Legs blue in the shower. The week of the 28th, I was done with the Prednisone and then all the pain came back and more. I can&#39;t take an inflammatory - the pain is still there and my usual cramps came back.

I don&#39;t know when the SOB started but it continued through the month of March. I thought it was an exacerbation of my chronic issues, by Sunday 4/4/20221  I coughed up blood, and on Monday I went to the hospital and had a CT scan and was told I had a pulmonary embolism and a clot in my leg. Now I&#39;m on an injectable blood thinner for the rest of my life and I was told it would take 3-4 months to resolve the blood clots.

                                                No Immediate effect. Not sure if events are related ! On March 24th 2021, patient received the one Janssen # 1805022 Covid vaccine, at home, from a at Home doctor.  1) On May 12th 2021, patient, at home on the vent, began getting tired, she threw up, could barely walk and eventually became totally lethargic. Her oxygen was low and the on hand nurse used the Ambu bag to get her oxygen up to 100, while I called the ENT?s. The ENT?s checked her vitals, and did an EKG. We spoke to the doctor, and although by that time she was acting somewhat ?normal?, the decision was made to take her to hospital. Her oxygen was stabilized and her CO2 at the hospital was 80. She remained in the hospital for four days.  2) On Sunday, July 4th, patient was at home on the ventilator.   Approximately 1:30 pm she seemed to become somewhat tired and she dropped her coffee cup.A little later, while eating, she threw up, spilling food and drink on her top. She seemed more tired and needed help changing her top. She sat in her recliner for a while and then she had to go to the bathroom. I took her there in a wheelchair. By the time she was ready to leave the bathroom, she was comatose and I had to lift her, she was dead weight, and place her in the wheelchair.  I rolled her to the recliner and lifted her into it.  She was then completely unconscious, with a continuously running nose and bubbles and fluid coming from her mouth ! Note: This was exactly same experience we had with her on May  12th 2021, when she was taken to hospital.   I increased her breath rate on the Vent from 16 to 20, hoping that would expel CO2. I also increased the oxygen setting on the floor concentrator to 9, her pulse oxy was stable at 90. With the help of my daughter in law and grandson, we repositioned her on the recliner to a more comfortable and accessible position, connected the AMBU bag to the oxygen and slowly applied oxygen through her trach connection.  We had also called the emergency, requesting assistance. By slowly squeezing the AMBU bag, I got her oxygen up to 100 ! Note: This Is exactly what we did on May 12 th.  The ENT?s arrived shortly and within a few minutes after they arrived, patient started to come out of her comatose condition. The ENT?s checked her vitals,(somewhat normal) did an EKG, and checked her CO2 (45).We spoke to the doctor, and by that time she was acting ?normal? ! The decision was made to keep her at home instead of going to the hospital and an at-home X-ray was ordered in case she aspirated and conducted the following day. This x-ray Did Not show any aspiration !
