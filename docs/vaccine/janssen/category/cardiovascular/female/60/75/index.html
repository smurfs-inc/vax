                                                7 hours from vaccine, my heart started palpitating and I started feeling sick. I got in my car to go home from a friends house and started severe chills and called Doctor for fear of heart attack. They told me to go to ER. I continued driving home. Chills got worse. I got in shower with heater on and chills persisted. Drank coconut water and heart palpitations resided.  Got in bed and fever spiked to 102 and every bone was inflamed in pain. Nyquil did nothing. After a few hours of severe and unbearable pain I called ER. Headed over to ER at 3:00 a.m. and sat in parking lot. Fever broke at 3:00 a.m. which was hour 14 after vaccine. Other than severe nausea, pain calmed down. Drove home with Tylenol. Took 1,000 mg and finally rested at 4:00 a.m. Woke up at 8:00 a.m. with nausea but pain gone. 24 hours from vaccine, most of the reaction gone. 48 hours out body normal but pain in injection site.

I shook uncontrollably the first 10-12 hours, and had chills. Tinnitus. Nothing inproved until the middle of Friday night- I sweated through sheets. Still had fever, high heart rate, and up and down oxygen for 18-20 days. My heart rate (I&#39;m on 2 anti-arrhythmia drugs so my rate is rarely above 65) was still high but better by day 22. Fever is also better but not gone. Exhausted.

                                                Felt hot within a few minutes after the vaccine, then passed out. The NP on site said she was unable to find a pulse so did 10 chest compressions before I woke up. Called the rescue squad who did an EKG on route to Hospital and once I was in the ER another EKG was performed along with blood work and chest X-ray. Entry was noted as allergic reaction but diagnosis was noted as Vasovagal Syncope, Adult. EKG?s performed along with labs were normal. I have pulled muscles, tendons and ligaments from the chest compressions which were questionable but since that day have experienced tingling in upper body and arms and have felt bad. Went back to my Primary Care Doctor for follow up on March 29 for another EKG. Have had panic attacks from the situation and per Doctor will take 2 months for my chest, muscles, tendons and ligaments to heal. Hard to determine if the way I have felt is from the vaccine or what transacted when I fainted. Today which is April 9, I still feel weak, normally I am very energetic. Just wanted to report as when I saw the news that others had some situations thought best to let you know.

                                                Was doing CDC TEXT tracing first week after injection, but new reactions started after tracking completed. Had mild reactions originally. Pain in arm, and fever next day that rose to 100.9. No chills, no major problems, no rash. A couple nose bleeds on second day which were not typical for me. Returned to work on third day. Now on day 10 I&#39;m convinced I&#39;m having a delayed reaction. Still mild but present. Low temp 99.5, headache, fatigue, feeling of not being normal. Not allowed to work today. Reason for report of such mild symptoms is my surprise of this delayed reaction 10 days later. There is a bruise on my injection arm now, opposite side of arm, that also is puzzling, but not really worrisome. Know to monitor for platelet issues.

Took 2 Tylenol every 4-6 hours to help the headache. It lasted until Sunday morning. My nose felt stuffy when I woke up Sunday morning at which time there was blood in my nose. The rest of the day it was clear but a small amount appeared Monday morning as well. Both sides of my temples are sore to the touch as if they were bruised. Other than that and being weak the other symptoms are gone.

                                                Developed heart palpitations approximately 10 hours after receiving vaccine. Also insomnia  making it impossible to sleep.  Palpitations seemed to get better by 11 am the next morning but my heart rate was still elevated ( pulse 106-112).  Shortly after that ( around 11:45 am) I became extremely light headed and dizzy and felt like I was going to pass out. I also started to feel nauseous and sweaty.   I rested lying down for two hours before hearing back from my doctor&#39;s office.  I was able to control the lightheadedness and dizziness by lying down. The feeling of passing out / nearly fainting went away.  I continued to feel nauseous and my  heartrate was still elected. I started to get a headache as well.  On the advise of a nurse at my doctor&#39;s office,  my husband took me to the ER.  My EKG was normal . My heartrate was elevated.  Due to the overcrowding at the ER that day I was made to wait at least an hour and half for further evaluation.  I continued to feel light headed and slightly dizzy. My nausea and headache got much worse .  I was finally taken back to a treatment room and received IV fluids, Zofran and Tylenol.  My heartrate went back to normal and my headache and nausea improved with treatment and I was discharged around 7pm.  I continued to feel very tired and slightly lightheaded that evening. The next morning  I was much more nauseous again and still very weak feeling and slightly lightheaded. I have  continued to feel weak, very fatigued , unwell and nauseous on and off until today, April 14, which is 6 days after I was vaccinated.

                                                Felt fine for hours while sitting at computer and then I got a feeling that I had never had before in my life. It felt as if there was an elephant sitting on my chest.  No real pain. No panting. Just a real heavy chest.  It is not heartburn or upset stomach - I know how that feels.   It was uncomfortable and notice I got a look of distress in my face. That&#39;s when I laid down on the couch with feet up and put my hands above my head towards the floor. After about 1.5 hours, the feeling went away.  Haven&#39;t had anything else since then.

Extreme fatigue two weeks.  The vaccine triggered an auto immune response.  It triggered a flareup in my body and I was very ill for several weeks.  Because of my severe stomach pain and blood pressure soaring my doctor ordered a CAT scan and blood work up.   I am now three weeks post vaccine and my body seems to be calming down my blood pressure has returned to normal and the stomach pain has stopped.  The extreme fatigue muscle and joint pain is still present but much better.

I woke up and was able to spit some of it out. It was clear and also tinged with blood. It stopped once I stood up. I immediately thought my brain was leaking.  I told my daughter about this the next day.  My balance was off and I had a weird flapping in my head for the next few days.  As well as a headache.  A few days after I heard about the blood clots. I am not 100% sure if it was from the shot but it was literally hours from when I received it. It was very scary.

My home blood pressure monitoring kit provided a reading of 149/99 and a resting heart rate of 108. Normally, my blood pressure is very well maintained with my meds and hovers in the 118/75 range. My resting heart rate is usually below 70. I was going to dial 911 but within 5 minutes, my heart rate began to slow down and I felt better. When I rechecked my numbers at 8 pm, BP was down to 118/80 and resting heart rate was 70.

Twenty minutes after shot, felt skin flush pass over me and was directed to private area where paramedic took blood pressure and checked for hives. No hives but bumpy skin. Blood pressure spiked to 186/75. No history of such high blood pressure. Waited a while and blood pressure went down, flush and skin bumps subsided, and I went home. Blood pressure erratic in evening but never as high. Next day pulse higher than normal. Took homeopathic remedy. Pulse slowed down a bit. Better by next day.

My life partner started calling my name and check my pulse (which he said was strong) ; then I came to but was really dizzy; I was nauseous and vomited for a few minutes; extremely hot/sweating; and after I stopped vomiting, then had a bowel movement (He had to aid me in getting to the bathroom).   About 20 - 25 minutes later I felt much better; everything calmed down.  I was ultimately able to fall back to sleep.

I went to the ER and they gave me fluids. I was told it was a reaction to the vaccine, but my paperwork said upper respiratory infection. My cough started out dry, I had SOB, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea and joint pain. My PCP put me on a steroid and an antibiotic Keflex (500mg, 3 times a day). I get lightheaded just walking around the house. I&#39;m still experiencing SOB, fatigue and the cough. Today is the first day that I could get up an move around. I&#39;m fine when I first wake up, but I eventually feel depleted.

                                                Beginning approximately 10 PM (about 8 hours post-injection), I started to have chills (feet were freezing) and was exhausted. Went to bed, and slept most of the night, only waking once to urinate and to drink a small amount (approx 2 oz) of Coca Cola -- I was very nauseous and thought it would help settle my stomach. During the night I sweated profusely. At 8 AM,  I woke again and went to urinate. At that time I felt very nauseous, dizzy, and light headed. When I walked about 2 -3 feet to my bedroom, I collapsed on the floor - unconscious. My partner called EMS, they arrived minutes later. By then I was conscious. They transported me to Medical Center Emergency Room, where I remained for several hours. They indicated that my SYNCOPE was a result of dehydration. TODAY, 4/13, news of BLOOD CLOTS has compelled me to report my adverse reaction.

Stayed off my feet. Right foot became very cold. 3/30/21 Saw my primary care physician at med center. She sent me for an ultrasound at medical arts. From there I was sent to the emergency room at hospital. I asked the attending physician assistant about a correlation between the blood clot and the Covid vaccine because I had read about it being a concern in other countries. He stated that was a bunch of baloney. Was told to have a repeat ultrasound in a few days and was prescribed a 30 day starter pack of Xarelto and released.  3/30 repeat penis ultrasound of right leg showed the same results. 4/1 appointment with hematologist. Prescribe Xarelto for three months and ordered a repeat ultrasound in three months and bloodwork at that time.

                                                Whether the adverse events were caused by the vaccine is to be determined.  We are available to discuss more details if this information can be used to help others from experiencing these reactions.  The morning after getting the vaccine, patient discovered that she could not swallow.  As her condition worsened, she was taken to the emergency room.  Over the past month, patient went to the emergency room 4 times.  The last time resulted in extended hospitalization that continues to this day.  In addition to the swallowing problem, two other major adverse events need to highlighted.  First, on 27 March, while in the hospital, vaginal bleeding started.  On 29 March, her doctor, performed a hysteriscopy/DNC finding &#34;  &#34;an unexplained blood clot (hematoma).&#34;  The second major event was when patient demonstrated significant confusion and lack of memory.  On 7 April, she was diagnosed with Metabolic Encephalopathy.  Neurologists at the hospital suspected that her MS was reacting to her UTI and once the infection is eliminated her memory should come back.  But as of 10 April, she was still having issues including hallucinations.  Although she is eating some as of 13 April, she is still very weak and will likely by moved from the Hospital to a rehab facility.  She still does not remember much of the last 37 days.

Stayed awake for a 1/2 - pain in teeth, jaw and head got got better.  Went back to bed for 4 hours.  When work up later in the afternoon - felt okay.

                                                Progress Notes - Clinical MD at 4/15/2021  1:30 PM     HPI:  61 year old female with IBS presents with concerns about adverse reactions to vaccine which she got on 3/19/21.   Patient reports that she felt lightheaded after the vaccine when she was leaving. She got home and felt better but then that night woke up in a delirium which passed by the morning. She had some weakness in her extremities, brain fog, cold feeling, funny GI feeling and fatigue for 3 days and then was fine.   Two weeks ago she started to feel that the circulation in her lower legs was cut off with sensation of blood pooling in her legs with associated numbness and tingling. She describes it as what you feel when a tourniquet is applied to your arm.  No visible lower extremity swelling, redness and no pain.    One week ago she felt like her right hand was not working well and then left hand too. She then felt pooling in her arms like the sensation in her legs.No swelling, redness or pain.   She reports she did a hand stand and afterward felt pooling sensation in her lower abdomen which has since resolved but continues to have a prickling sensation that comes and goes.   Last night while lying on her back she felt the pooling sensation in her chest and this morning throbbing in head and chest and neck. That is when she decided to come in and be seen.    Patient denies severe headache, backache, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, bruises, unusual bleeding or rashes.   Patient has not had a physical exam with blood work since 11/9/17.

                                                My sister, received the J &amp; J vaccine on March 5th.  I now know that she was not feeling well for a few days afterwards.  She then felt better until day nine after the vaccine.  On the evening of the ninth day,  she began having abdominal pain, vomiting &amp; diarrhea, headache. This was Sunday evening.  Unfortunately I wasn?t aware of how she was feeling and she didn?t go to the emergency rm. until Tuesday morning.  Tests determined her platelet level was low and abdominal CT showed bleeding from her adrenal glands.  She was given platelets, pain meds and admitted into the hospital.  Later that night staff felt she wasn?t responsive and a head CT was performed.  It was determined she had a brain hemorrhage and emergency surgery was performed. It is my understanding that there was brain damage at that point.  During the early morning hours of the 10th day, post surgery, a repeat CT scan was done showing more hemorrhaging and blood clots. She also developed a  DVT and PE and was kept on a respirator until the 13th day post vaccine to allow family to say their goodbyes.  On the morning of the 13th day patient was removed from life support and she passed.

Began at around 10am. Felt like I was dying. Placed on Stroke Unit. Scans and tests all negative for stroke and Drs. thought could be panic attack or TIA. Since then my lingering effects point to TIA, Seemed to clear up around 2pm with gradual improvement through the day. Still experiencing some side effects including tinnitus, memory and word retrieval issues, fatigue, anxiety.  DO NOT HAVE PANIC ATTACKS. The only time I have had a panic attack was at 26 after the death of my mother.

                                                Not sure exactly when water retention began, but exactly 2 weeks after vaccine 03-27-2021 during middle of night, I woke to a bloody nose.  Got it stopped. Next day felt a bit off but okay.  At 9 pm 3-28-2021 had a huge bloody nose, just came out of nowhere.  Looked inside was coming from not the nose walls but from way up inside sinus cavity?  Tried to get it stopped, nothing worked, and 2 times it came out my mouth. Called our local Emergency room, went in.  Blood pressure was at one time 220/110. They gave me 2 sprays of Affrin to reduce blood vessels, and tried to insert a nose plug (cotton gauze) to stop it, wouldn&#39;t fit, too small of nasal passage.   Administered 2 pills,  then drugs through IV then another pill form over 4 hours later blood pressure was still high some numbers while there were 204/94, 188/93 then when released and bleeding stopped 188/86.  Next day 3-26-2021 immediately after taking my regular meds bleeding started again!!! So tried to get appointment with my doctor, they were full advised me to go /back to ER. Went about 1:00pm my BP was 181/73 Dr ran tests: EKG normal, Blood tests, good, and chest e-x-ray good. She also tried 2 diff types of meds, oral and iv, then I asked for losartan.  and left.

                                                8 hours after getting the vaccine I started feeling very cold. It came on me all of a sudden.  Shaking, shivering, teeth chattering ensued along with generally feeling very unwell.  (Similar to how I felt years ago after having surgery)  This progressed during the night to fever, chills, extreme body aches, stabbing pains in the head, heart racing, dizziness and nausea.  After 12 hours I started to feeling improvement.  At the 16 hour mark I am really tired and nauseous but feel like I&#39;m coming back.  Probably the worst I&#39;ve ever felt.  We considered going to the ER in the night.

I woke up and I was talking gibberish. I was aware that nothing I said was making sense. I went to bed and slept almost 24 hours. I woke up feeling wiped out but I wasn&#39;t confused and I was talking normal again. Right arm hurt and is numb. ( right side of my body typically is kind of numb but the right arm seemed more so numb after the vaccine)

                                                The actual injection itself was so painful that I almost passed out. It hurts so badly while the needle was in my arm and when she took it out it was worse. I was in such pain that I began to sweat profusely and apparently I turned white and began dry heaving. This was all within a minute or so.  I really thought I was going to pass out. A woman with a tag that said pharmacist came rushing over. She got a reclining chair with wheels, they help me into it and then took me to a recovery room. After a few more minutes of sweating and dry heaving I began feeling better.  The pharmacist got me some paper towels so I could dry myself off as I was drenched in sweat. I asked her for a bottle of water. I waited the 15 minutes and came home.  They never checked my vital signs. Once I got home, I laid down and slept for 15 hours. I was fine the next day and my arm was never sore.  Could  the shot have hit a nerve? I?ve never felt such acute pain.

As she was walking up to the post vaccination waiting area after receiving the vaccine, she suffered what appeared to be an anxiety attack and fainted. She awoke quickly and was monitored by pharmacy staff. She maintained good blood pressure and was fine afterwards.

                                                A few minutes after the vaccine my heart began palpatating and I began sweating profusely.  My vitals were checked, I was given water and moved to a cooler area of the facility.  HR was still elevated but I wasnt feeling as flushed.  By 4pm that evening I began having having chills and a fever of 100-100.4 which lasted about 4hrs.  Later that evening my HR elevated to 125 with the feeling of feeling I was having a heart attack.  By that Wed. my HR was still at 125 in motion and about 75 still so I went to visit my PCP on Thurs and when I arrived the HR was 77 but during the visit it elevated to 125 and blood work was done resulting in my tyroid level elevated and since getting the vaccine my HR had been up and down.  When in motion its elevated and when sitting its around 75.

I thought it was my N95 mask so decided to head to the car after my 15 minute wait period was completed.  After sitting down in the car I started the following symptoms:  shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, swelling of face, dizziness, weakness.  I sit in the car for approximately 15 minutes then headed home.  I had a driver (thank goodness).  I continued to have symptoms and what felt like elevated blood pressure (I did not have access to a pressure cuff).  After resting at my driver&#39;s house for about 5 hours I felt better and headed home.  The next morning the symptoms were less but still present.  In addition I had a slight rash on my stomach that wrapped around my back.  After approximately 48 hours all of the symptoms subsided.  My blood pressure had returned to normal also.  All swelling went down.

                                                One week after my vaccination, I had what I thought was an asthma attack. I used my inhaler and it eased the symptoms for a short while, but I had to use it again a short time later as my breathing was a bit labored. My chest tightened up and it was hard to take deep breaths. From that date on, I have had tightness in the lungs and it hurts to breath deeply. It is getting so I am tired now after having this issue for the past 10 days or more. It seems to come and go and is not constant, but it does happen every day since March 10, 2021.

I took 2.5mg of Ambian thinking that if I could just fall asleep, I would sleep it off. After an hour of non-stop symptoms, I fell asleep for about an hour only to wake up  with the severe neck and back pain and headache still present. The body shaking had subsided.   The next day, I was tired but fine.

Then began to get headache with slight fever and the headache got progressively worse, with nausea and rapid heart rate. The headache was so bad I could not sleep at all - the worst headache I have ever had. I took one extra-strength Tylenol at about 10 or 11 am the next day, March 12, which took the edge off the headache. The headache diminished till it was gone by about 8 or 9 pm. The rapid heart rate, along with tiredness, low energy, and feeling jittery continued for several days, then stopped.

I alerted the person at the vaccination site saying something was not right and then they called the paramedics who took my vitals and said my heart rate and blood pressure was extremely high. They gave me a shot of Benadryl and oxygen because I was feeling shortness of breath. They kept me until about 11:35 in observation when I felt myself again. The headache, nausea and body aches stayed for about 2 weeks but all other symptoms subsided.

                                                Upon waking 2 days after receiving vaccine, I suffered from excruciating headache that was incapacitating.  It did not resolve with aspirin, which prompted me to check my blood pressure.  My BP was extremely elevated at 145/85.  I then took 1 dose of common &#34;water pill&#34; 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide.  This did not bring down BP or resolve headache, 2 hours later I took 20 mg of Valsartan.  This also did not resolve headache or lower BP, so I took another 20 mg of Valsartan, followed by another 25 mg of water pill.  My BP stabilized later that evening and headache resolved by 8 p.m.  This same event occurred 2 more times, the last day being 4/10/21.  On that date I was completely incapacitated by excruciating headache.  I took 40 mg of Valsartan but headache did not resolve until late that evening.

                                                10 minutes after shot i started to feel tingling and numbness in my chest which traveled to my neck and into face. Began having a dry cough, went to nurse to as if normal, she said no, she started monitoring me. Still had cough, then became light headed and nausea. She gave me 25 mg of  Benadryl,  coughing continued, breathing became rapid, then I was given  shot of epi,  I became dizzy again and couldn?t complete a sentence. Words were slurred, heart beat racing. EMT?s were called. Received another shot of  Benadryl. It did not counteract anything. Received another shot of epi. Had uncontrollable shakes and hard to breathe or speak.  Was difficult to get BP reading due to shaking. Finally got reading of 196/99. EMT listened to heart and lungs. Said all was good. Taken to ER for monitoring of heart, Lungs and BP. Was there for approximately 2 hours u til shakes and BP were good.

                                                I called a message that patient had experienced a stroke recently and had also rececived the Jansson vaccine. I called patient, who had reported that it happened on 4/2. She had woke up and couldn&#39;t put her robe on. Her left arm was not working right. She also noted  that she had drooled. She kept thinking that she was find and got ready and went to work. During work she was typing and found that her left hand was not working still, but still went throughout her day and typed with her right hand. Later that evening when she got home, her husband took her to the ER. There, she reports that her blood pressure was through the roof. She had a CT scan and MRI and labs done and was diagnosed with a TIA. She was started on Plavix, baby aspirin, and was started on a statin drug (couldn&#39;t remember the name as that information was at home and she was at work at time of call). She is on a heart monitor for 4 weeks and has follow ups with her outside PCP and cardiologist. Today she states that she is feeling back to normal and has regained function on her left side. She reports that she had a headache at time that had lasted for a while. She also reports that she feels like she was having issues weeks before because her brain felt foggy and just was not thinking right.

                                                I received the Janssen COVAX on Monday morning, 5 Apr 2021.  A week later, on Monday evening, 12 Apr 2021, I experienced extremely painful leg cramps and broke out in a sweat. I felt extremely nauseous, and weak, this was followed by a sever pain in my head that was so extreme that I passed out. After coming to, the pain in my head finally began to subside, along with the leg cramps. My husband indicated that I was unconscious for just under a minute.  For the next two days, I had bouts of nausea, headaches, sweats, and was extremely tired.  On Wednesday, 14 Apr, after learning of the issues related to the Janssen vaccine, and the symptoms described being what I experienced, I contacted the advice (cont&#39;d)..Additional information for Item 18: Line and was told to go to Emergency Room at the hospital, which I did.  I do not feel that they addressed my concerns or the symptoms that I was experiencing, and at no time did they try to determine if it was due to the vaccine.  The discharge papers did not even address the &#34;event&#34; and the &#34;symptoms&#34; that I described.  They did not take any information down related to the vaccine, lot number, etc., that I had received.  They seemed to go through a set routine:  blood pressure, blood work, temperature, EKG, and CAT scan.    21. (continued)...Visited Emergency Room, however, was requested by ER to go to Primary Care as follow-up, however, as a  Employee we cannot be seen by Primary Care on THIS site.  Instead , we have to go on the local clinic to receive care.  The issue is that this was a vaccine that I was scheduled by my leadership to receive, with no choice in choosing which vaccine I could receive, and without follow-up care for adverse reactions. The hospital did not indicate to me that I should report this incident, however, I am concerned as a result of the &#34;event&#34; that I experienced, that it should be reported.  Furthermore,we should have a choice as to which vaccine we want to receive, just as everyone does.  Your form does not allow for input addresses  Also, your form does not allow for a phone number.

                                                2 hours after receiving the vaccine, I grew exhausted and had to sleep into late evening and was chilled,  had a fever of 101 and developed severe pain and inflammation on the top of my collar bone that was feverish and migrated toward my shoulder region on the same side as my vaccine. Ibuprofen would not help with the pain but helped with the fever. My mind told me that I had things to tend to the next day, but still was forced to sleep off and on for 2 more days. After a week and a half, not only did I have thirst, but also food didn&#39;t taste right and was metallic.  This lasted for 2 days and finally my taste was restored. The exhaustion lasted off and on for 2 weeks and I just listened to my body. The pain and inflammation on my collar bone has subsided 4 days ago but still have pain in my shoulder when I sleep.  On April 5 around 8:30 a.m. a nasty virus hit me out of the blue. I grew week and tired and had to go to bed. I slept all day until around 9:00 p.m. and woke to uncontrollable diarrhea and fainting spell while in the bathroom. I had abominable pain and nausea that last for a half hour and then I returned to bed. The next 2 days, I was week and exhausted but continued with my regular routine.  My equilibrium is still affected from time to time.

                                                In the evening I started to feel aches in my eyes and joints.  I was having trouble falling asleep.  I woke up every 2 hours. My heart bpm went up to 102 in the middle of the night.  I know this because my fit bit was vibrating and encouraging me to keep exercising and I was just laying in bed trying to sleep.  I finally got up around 2:30 in the morning and took 1 Aleve. I also took my temperature with a forehead type and it was 98.5, so no high fever.  I took another Aleve around 7:00 in the morning.  Now I am feeling fine.  It&#39;s now 8:22 a.m. and I am working from home.  I just wanted to report that the aches in joints and 102 bpm and unable to fall asleep were my side effects.  I feel fine now.  I will continue to take Aleve as needed.   I have never been tested for Covid.  I have never had any symptoms to warrant testing for covid.  Since March 13, 2020 I have been fortunate to work for a company that has us all working from home.  We are still working from home.  i am 63 years old.  I shop around 6 a.m. in the morning for groceries to avoid people. I do not go out.  I have been very careful.

About 8 hours after injection, muscle ached and so was chilled but felt ok otherwise.  FitBit alerted me that I was earning points for being in my ?active zone? even though I was just watching tv - resting heart rate is 66   (actively exercising, heart rate  is usually less than 120) but it was 136&#43;.  HR stayed elevated ( Verified HR with pulse oximeter) while I was not  doing anything. Took temperature (forehead thermometer) and it was 103F.  Took Tylenol. Heart rate slowly went down after Tylenol kicked in and fever came down to 101.  Heart rate stayed a little higher than normal and fever lasted 24 hours. By 48 hours, all was well.

                                                Patient called clinic 4/13 to report having been seen by PCP and in ER twice since vaccination. She reported onset of headache and fatigue day of vaccine. She reported later feeling short of breath and having a  decreased tolerance of activity.  She stated she had an elevated heartrate and &#34;neurological symptoms&#34;, but did not specify. She reports still feeling off at this time 4/13 and having appointments scheduled with a Vascular surgeon and neurologist in the near future. I am doing the reporting as the vaccine was given by Public Health staff, but this is the first notification we have received of the her potential adverse reaction.

On the 12th had severe chest pains which I chalked up to a very bad case of heart burn.  On March 24th, while driving I had two major (what I thought at the time) was panic attacks...body started shaking, heart was beating like crazy, couldn&#39;t catch my breath, felt like I was going to pass out or die.  Had to pull over twice to calm myself down.  (From what I read this could be a sign of a blood clot but I am not a doctor.)  Had minor heart burn until April 5th....which ironically was the end of my 28 days until the vaccine fully kicked in.  Just reporting what happen.  I feel fine now.

                                                Throbbing pain at injection site and entire arm. Unable to move up without assistance. Pain grew more and more intense. Went to urgent care on unspecified date. NP examined me and discovered a lump in my arm. Both the lump and the vaccination site hurt when she pressed on them. She prescribed presdone and gave me a work order for a vascular ultrasound to be performed on my left arm. I went on unspecified date for the scan. It was discovered that a DVT blood clot had formed in my brachial vein in the left arm. I was then prescribed eliquis, 20 mg a day for 7 days and told not to take the predesone. NP called my pcp, his office immediately called me and asked me to come in as they are concerned about the high dosage of the eliquis.

Symptoms became severe within 30 minutes thereafter, at which time I experienced difficulty standing. After five hours with no improvement, I used my home blood pressure monitor to check my BP and HR; BP was high for me, 120/90 sustained, and HR varied between 135 and 150, with 143 being the most consistent value after multiple readings. I seemed to be experiencing a &#34;severe allergic reaction&#34; per the instructions I was given and called 9-1-1.

                                                Within a few hours of receiving the vaccine, I started feeling nauseated. Since the day I took the vaccine, my appetite has been nonexistent. A day later, I felt very tired and confused. I received the vaccine on Monday and I woke up in a panic on Wednesday morning. My heart was racing, palms were sweaty, I felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe and it seemed like I was having a panic attack when I woke up. From that point forward, I fell into a deep depression. At first I didn&#39;t connect it with the vaccine, but I kept feeling nauseated and then wondered if it was connected. The depression became unbearable and I felt suicidal by the next week. I finally contacted my doctor&#39;s office and had a telemed visit where I explained that I had the J&amp;J vaccine the week before and these symptoms presented themselves afterward. The doctor put me on Zoloft and I HAVE been treated for depression in years past with that; however, I had not taken depression medication for about 8-10 years until this. Likewise, because my doctor put me on an anti-depressant, she also wanted me to see a counselor--which I have done. The medication is helping somewhat but I still don&#39;t have an appetite. I don&#39;t know if the vaccine had anything to do with the depression, but I wanted to report it just in case others have had similar symptoms.

Patient waited in waiting area and complained to her husband about feeling dizzy and might faint. Pharmacists went to aid the patient and lay her down gently, monitored her blood pressure which was high at the time, once patient sat up her BP decreased, it fluctuated the whole time, EMT was called and once they arrived and monitored her, they said the cause of her fainting was due to her blood pressure. Patient was alert and responsive the whole time. Patient was unsure if she took her BP medicine this morning.

Feeling as though I was being stabbed dead center of my chest and it came out my back.  I had trouble breathing or felt like it hurt more when I tried to take a deep breath. This was very severe for about 2 hours then eased off  and was off and on for about two days. My arm did not get sore until the third day after my vaccination and remains sore still. I?ve experienced a headache in severity ranging from a nuisance to temple throbbing since the day after vaccination.  I have taken my naproxen for the chest pain and headache.  I ran a temp of 99-100 occasionally but never for a long period of time.  I?m still experiencing some chest pain  occasionally but nothing as severe as  the first two days.

Three days later (ie, 13 days post vaccination), she went to the emergency room (ER) and was admitted to the hospital. During the hospitalization, a clot was removed via catheterization and she was administered unspecified anticoagulants. A second clot resolved on its own without surgical intervention. After 6 days in the hospital, she was discharged with ticagrelor which was later changed to clopidogrel. She recovered from the clots. Thirteen days after discharge, she began to experience headache and &#34;pressure&#34; in both legs and hands. She was advised to go to the ER; no further information was provided. Based on the limited information, the relationship of the serious events with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine is considered indeterminant. Additional information is being sought.

                                                Department of Health received a call from her sister, in response to a call/letter/text sent out to all recipients of the Janssen vaccine. She stated that her sister received the J and J vaccine on 3/12/21 (confirmed in State vaccine system) at the hospital where she receives her oncology care.  She reported the following:  &#34;She had a massive stroke on MARCH 27TH, 2021 leaving her paralyzed on the right side with the inability to speak, swallow, or see. She was initially diagnosed with Ovarian cancer approximately three and one half years ago. She was chosen for a study with Pharmaceuticals and her diagnosis was changed to a vary rare form of cancer called clear cell carcinoma which originates in the gynecological area. She did have a previous stroke approximately three years ago, (just after original diagnosis) but she was on a different course of treatment at that time...Oncologists have explained that this most recent stroke event would not be considered a side effect of her current treatment routine. She wanted to bring it to the attention of the health department in case it needs to be looked at more closely by the J&amp;J research/scientific team. She passed away on 4/5/21. Her current treatment consisted of palliative chemo only. &#34;  Decedent was a resident but was vaccinated in another state. After the CVA she was brought to the hospital and subsequently transferred to the Medical Center where she died on 4/5/2021. Sister is willing to speak with any investigators if deemed necessary.

                                                Patient received Janseen COVID vaccine. The first 1/2 of the vaccine was given easily IM to the left deltoid and then the patient complained of severe arm pain, tensed her muscles, and the last 0.25ml was difficult to inject. Then the patient became hypotensive 90/45, dizzy, and felt like she was going to pass out. She was laid in the supine position, given a cool cloth for her forehead and monitored for approx. 45 minutes. Her blood pressure remained 90/60, 96/56 at discharge. Her heart rate ranged from 55-65, regular. Her son came to take her home as we did not feel comfortable with the patient driving. The patient was continuously monitored by the NPs and APCT. She ambulated without difficulty and was discharged home. She was given information for V-safe to report her reaction and advised to follow up in the ER for any SOB, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, syncope, CP, etc.

On Saturday, March 20, 2021 my blood pressure was 195/95. Obviously my husband took me to ER where I was given a prescription to hopefully lower my blood pressure. The medicine that I was give is Amlodipine. My blood pressure typically runs 120&#39;s over low 70&#39;s. I know this issue is not listed on your list of side effects. My husband has also experienced the same issue, just not to the extreme that it affected me. His has been up around 20 points.

His BP continued to rise a little each day and thought our machine was off,  Then I took mine about 3 days later and my BP was 158/83- higher than I ever remember it.  Usually it is about 118 over seventy something.    It was back to about 108 over seventy something 5 days after the vaccine.  I wasn&#39;t going to report it, but thought someone might want to know.

She saw PCP and had blood pressure medications adjusted to control hypertension, however, nosebleeds have persisted.  I have given her my personal cell phone number to call me immediately  and to go to Emergency Room if bleeding worsens or other problems arise such as sudden, severe headache.  (Patient states that blood flow contained clots for the first day or two, but has been flowing without clots each day at least and sometimes twice per day.  She is able to stop blood flow within 5 minutes by packing nostril each time.)  I have instructed patient to make appointment with ENT (Ear, Nose, Throat) Dr.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Approximately six hours after administration of the vaccine, patient experienced sever chills and dizziness. Unable to stop shaking, patient took temperature which registered at 95.4F and then 95.1F at 15 minutes. Patient donned flannel pants, thermal shirt, and oversized hooded sweatshirt and got in bed under flannel sheets, two doubled-over blankets, a bedspread, and quilt. A down-filled king-size pillow was placed on top of patient&#39;s torso and a space heater was turned on to highest setting. Patient reports heart seemed to be racing, but did not take BP. Unable to quell the chills, the patient continued to shake, developing very stiff shoulders, neck and back as a result. This continued until approximately 2 am. The next morning, patient&#39;s temperature was registering at 99.4F and pulse was 96, but patient did not report chills. General muscle aches and mild headache were noted. At time of this report, patient&#39;s temperature and pulse are normal (97.6F and 76 pulse).

I hardly slept. (all these not worrisome to me) I&#39;m so glad my vaccine provider warned me that with underlying conditions, the vaccine could make them flare up. Which they did. In the morning I had widespread pain all over. Severe headache, and shortness of breath. Because I already have near emphysema hypoxemia oxygen levels, I checked my Oximeter and my blood oxygen was in the dangerously low 70&#39;s.  It stayed there until I put my oxygen concentrator on. Monitoring oxygen levels all day, I was able to keep it in the 80&#39;s to 90&#39;s, which helped.  40 hrs after injection , symptoms already fading away. All my adverse events were related to underlying conditions responding to the inflammation of the immune response. I feel  protected, glad I had the oxygen handy,  and I feel great about the  J &amp; J vaccine!

Later at night I had a low grade fever with achiness and headache. The flu like symptoms resolved by morning but I continue to have vertigo and intermittent nausea and my BP was still high in the morning around 9 am but came down by 12:45 to my normal range.  Paramedics at the site did a BP, pulse ox, blood sugar, ECG . Everything was normal except my BP which was 180/90.  This morning it was 167/98 and 168/97.  No treatment.  Saw my doctor&#39;s partner at 1:00 today and BP was back to my normal range but I still have mild vertigo and intermittent nausea.  Doc gave me some exercises to do for the vertigo and did not seem to think that it was related to the shot, but since the paramedics said they had seen a LOT of the same reaction yesterday to the J&amp;J shot and two sites in other cities shut down for the same reactions, nobody will convince me that it was anything but the shot. I expected the flu like side effects but never dreamed it would cause my  BP to spike and the vertigo.

                                                HPI Details: a 66-year-old female presenting today for evaluation of high blood pressure.  Patient notes that she went to the dentist on March 24 and was having a root canal revised.  She was told that she had very elevated blood pressure at that time, 173/81.  When they rechecked her blood pressure it had gone up even higher.  She was not feeling necessarily bad at that time but did start noticed that she was having some pounding headaches and felt like her heart was pounding out of her chest.  She has not really changed activity or diet.  She is not on any new supplements or over-the-counter meds that would cause this.  The only thing different was that she did receive the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine just prior to onset of this.  Patient was concerned about her blood pressure running so high, and she is a physician so she did prescribe herself some atenolol.  She took a couple of doses of this on March 29 when she received her blood pressure cuff in the mail from online store and was checking her blood pressure and found that her numbers were running quite high, such as 207/107.  She contacted our office.  I did go ahead and start her on lisinopril 10 mg p.o. daily.  This did not make a significant improvement in her blood pressure.  We did go ahead and get lab work done.  CBC was unremarkable.  CMP notable for potassium 3.3 and alk phos minimally elevated at 129.  TSH was within normal limits.  Patient does bring in a log of her blood pressures with her today.  Again these are not really improving significantly with the lisinopril 10 mg daily.

We called the emergency services when they arrived she had collapsed. They broke the window and took her to the hospital, upon arrival we were informed that she has got a hemorrhage possible clotting due to high blood pressure. I now know the term is Cerebral Hemorrhage, she has been in ICU on a ventilation machine while they tried to drain the blood and clots. She&#39;s currently out of ICU however still complains about headache and back pain. We are informed that she has now developed some blood pressure and diabetes however it could be cleared in the short term. She&#39;s at the hospital and unknown how long she would have to stay there.

This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: A 66 year old female, unspecified ethnicity, was diagnosed with venous stasis ulcers and thrombocytopenia 16 days after receiving the covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s. The patient went to the emergency room for the leg swelling (start date unknown) that was progressing over 2 days. Medical history includes hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and type II diabetes. Patient also has coronary artery disease with recent segment elevation myocardial infarction left anterior descending (STEMI LAD) s/p Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, low Ejection Fraction 30% (from 60%), s/p Single Chamber ICD. Concomitant medications not reported. Smoking history not provided. Echocardiogram revealed worsening EF - 15% from 30%, Moderate MR, Moderate to Severe Pulmonary Hypertension. Thrombocytopenia was reported without a reported platelet count. The patient was subsequently admitted to the hospital for unspecified number of days and was reported to have recovered from all events. Given the patient&#39;s extensive medical history, there is a plausible alternate explanation for swelling of legs and venous stasis ulcers, and there is limited information to make a meaningful assessment of the report of thrombocytopenia. Additional information is requested.

Body aches lasted three weeks. Fever lasted about 4 days. No appetite, diarrhea. Sill lack of appetite and run down and nothing tastes good. The fatigue is lingering. The breathing and low oxygen levels are still causing problems since the first dose.

                                                15-20 minutes after the injection, I started feeling a tightness in back of my throat; I broke out in cold sweat. I started getting dizzy and very whoozy. I felt my vision starting to close in. I thought I was going to pass out. I got the attention of the person across me to get an attendant and they brought me a chair with wheels. Two people got me up (and I&#39;m not a big person) - they were worried I was going down and I was taken to exam room. They said I was white as a sheet. She checked my eyes and throat a few times and checked my blood pressure. It was lower than normal but she didn&#39;t seem really concerned about it - 104 over 60 something which is low for me. She gave me water to sip. She gave me very cold compresses to put on my forehead. They watched me pretty good. She had the epi-pen ready. She watched me and I sat in there and nurse came in a quite a few times to check me for about an hour. About an hour later the tightness went away and I started feeling myself again. We went home. I went to sleep. I woke up at night to go to bathroom and I was still a little woozy but I didn&#39;t fall. Next day, I just didn&#39;t feel well. My left arm was starting to hurt - was no swelling; it was a little red at injection site. It hurt just a little. I was woozy. My eyes couldn&#39;t focus as well. I felt out of it. I drank a lot of water and took a nap.  Yesterday, I felt pretty decent but still woozy somewhat. I tried to run errands with my husband  - just wasn&#39;t quite right. Today, much better but I&#39;m not quite myself yet. Just a little wooziness - weird feeling. Yesterday, I did feel a soreness in the back of my right calf muscle. It wasn&#39;t warm to the touch or swollen. I don&#39;t have it anymore, it went away.  It could have been a muscle thing from the first day of the vaccine when I got home and I got up and almost fell down. I do still have some achiness in joints. Especially in my knees - which isn&#39;t normal because they are replaced.

She initially presented with uncontrollable shaking/bouncing legs, palpitation, sweating, and shortness of breath (though this was very brief.   Patient remained coherent and oriented to time/person/place.   The shaking and palpitations subsided after a couple minutes and resumed towards the end of the 15 minute waiting period, accompanied by nausea.  25 minutes post-vaccination she appeared to have stabilized, and we assisted the patient to her room nearby at her request to allow her to lie down while being monitored.  After returning to her room, she very quickly ran to her sink due to her nausea, then after a minute of attempting to vomit, she collapsed and appeared to have briefly lost consciousness.  EMS was called and the patient was rolled onto her side to prevent choking in the event of emesis.  Patient remained responsive, but was weak and clammy with a weak pulse and breathing.  After the firefighters came, a search of the apartment found the previously listed medications.  Additionally, the patient experienced a seizure-like episode lasting 15 seconds in duration.  Once the EMT came, they assessed her and monitored her in the ambulance; they reported that her condition appeared stable, her vitals were strong, and transported her to Hospital for observation/testing.

My heart rate stayed at 109 or more until 10 PM the next night when its slowly went down to a normal heart rate.  At 3 am  (12 hours after the shot) i had  a blinding debilitating headache that lasted until 9pm the next night.   It also affected my vision.   The headache was so bad i could not concentrate on the simplest task.  I  was unsure of what i could take for the headache.   So, I did not take anything.    When i woke up i was very tired and this lasted until the following day.  6am i had a fever of 102.3 this went down to 100.4 at 9:15 pm that night.  I also had chills for several hours. 9:20 AM  the nausea started followed by vomiting and dizziness.   This only lasted for a few hours.    I  experienced very vivid dreams the night of the shot.    I only drank some coconut water all day and could not eat any food.  The next day Saturday March 27 i felt better but the fatigue did not go away until late in the evening.   Sleeping seemed to help but i could only sleep for 2- 3 hours at the most.

She felt well enough to leave the pharmacy on her own after 25-30 minutes.  The  patient had a prior history of anxiety prior to receiving vaccinations and was very nervous about getting the vaccination prior to administration.  The patients daughter was with her and felt that her symptoms were due to anxiety about  getting vaccinated, but later called the pharmacy asking to report the adverse events as being related to receiving the vaccine.  It is not known weather or not the symptoms are directly related to the vaccine.

                                                Patient reports that the morning following vaccination, she awoke with chest pain and palpitations. She took a nitroglycerin and a baby aspirin, upon which the pain subsided. She was fine for the remainder of the day. The next morning she had chest pains again to a much lesser degree; they resolved in the same manner after treatment. She has been in contact with her cardiologist for a follow-up, unsure if related to vaccination or a flare up of her pre-existing condition.

                                                Five minutes after getting injection, I noticed a tightening and tingling in my throat, mouth, trachea; sharp sudden onset headache; racing pulse 100 beats per minute; blood pressure 154/100. Because of the headache, I had the pharmacist take my BP. Upper palate was scratchy and irritated. Took 25 milligram tablet of Benedryl. Throat getting tighter but no shortness of breath. At 4:00 BP was 164/104, pulse still 100. At 4:00 took another 25 mg of Benedryl. BP remained high. Stayed for an hour. Turned down epi-pen because her breathing was fine. 5:15 BP still 164/104. Left site and started feeling itchy-- eyelids, lip, scalp. 7:00 BP had come down. 148/94, pulse 88; headache persisted. Took 650 mg of aspirin. 9:00 headache had lessened and BP was 138/80, pulse was 84. By 10:00, moderate headache. Slept. Woke up at 12:00 am with muscle pain in right leg. 3:30 am woke with bad headache, chilled, slight fever (99.6), rash on right trunk and upper abdomen. Took two more aspirin for headache. 8:00 am 130/76, normal temp, hives.

The patient&#39;s height and weight were not reported. The patient was not pregnant at the time of event reporting.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 1802070, expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, administered on right deltoid muscle on 09-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 10-MAR-2021, the patient had a planned surgery (decompression fusion).  On 13-MAR-2021, the patient had a horrible pain and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed that she had large spinal hematoma. On 15-MAR-2021, hematoma was drained &#34;(3 units of blood)&#34;. At the time of this report, the patient still had a little bump and her platelets dropped from 14 to 7. The patient was discharged on 21-MAR-2021; treatment details were not provided. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient was recovering from large spinal hematoma, and the outcome of platelets dropped from 14 to 7 was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0 This report concerns a 70-year-old female patient who had a spinal hematoma, 3 days after a planned surgery and 4 days after receiving Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.  One day after vaccination, the patient had the planned decompression fusion. Three days after surgery (4 days after vaccination), the patient had a severe pain and MRI revealed a large spinal hematoma. Two days after, hematoma was drained (&#34;3 units of blood&#34;).  Patient&#39;s platelet counts dropped from &#34;14 to 7&#34; (unit not specified). The patient was discharged from the hospital six days later.  Although spinal surgery is the risk factor for hematoma, based on the close temporal relationship, the causality for the events is considered plausible for vaccine. Additional information has been requested.

                                                about two hours after injection,  I experienced headache,  then mild dizziness,  then extreme dizziness,  then sudden overwhelming fatigue,  then swollen eyes and eyelids,  then chills and elevated heart rate,  with pounding.    I had to cancel the class I was supposed to teach,  because I would not have been safe to drive to campus.  I slept from approximately 2:30 pm on March 8 until 8:30 am today,  March 9,   all symptoms continuing,  with bathroom breaks, a couple of short reports to family members who were watching out for me,  and one  2-hour window during which I ate a small meal,  went back to bed,  and read part of a book.    During bathroom breaks I took more antronex,  some milk thistle,  and some glutathione,  which seemed to at least temporarily reduce dizziness and eye/eyelid swelling.  At one point I took some hawthorne tincture because I was concerned about the heart pounding.    Today I woke up feeling symptom-free,  but by 2 pm I was compelled by sudden fatigue to take a two-hour nap.   After that I felt better,  and I think I am now fine,  at 7:45 pm on 3/9/21.    I am happy to have gotten the Janssen vaccine,  because it is one and done!

On March 30 I was admitted to the hospital with excessive blood clots in my right leg and right lung.  My Pulmonary Dr felt I should report this to you.  I did have blood clots last year and recently ( February 8th) had back surgery both circumstances could of contributed to the issue.

My heart would not slow down; I sat in my recliner and kept deep breathing and had calming herbal tea; was afraid to go to the ER due to Covid.  After more than 4 hours with a racing heart, I felt exhausted and laid down around 12:30 a.m. and fell asleep.  I woke around 3 am with nausea and soaking wet pajamas from sweating.  I fell asleep again and woke around 7 am; I felt very tired, woozy and my heart hurt.  I felt a bit more normal after a few days.  I still feel a bit dizzy and light headed.  I was concerned when I later heard some J&amp;J vaccines were contaminated; on 4/2/21, I called the pharmacy because the number they wrote on my card, 1805D18 wasn&#39;t clear; they told me this # was incorrect and should be 037A21B and couldn&#39;t explain why this was so. They were going to check into  this and call me; I called them again on 4/5/21 and was told the correct # was 043A21A and that the vaccine was from the Netherlands.  They couldn&#39;t offer any more information or explain why the initial # was incorrect. I find this concerning and have been unable to find an answer.

Massive headache by Monday and ringing in ears.  Took Naproxin and Mucinex Monday morning before going to work.  At the end of the day I took Naproxin and Mucinex in order to sleep.  By Tuesday I had chest congestion which has gotten only worse along with needle-like pain in the chest upon coughing. I spit up yellow phlegm, tiredness behind eyes returned, sneezing, choking on phlegm, and constant runny nose and ringing in ears.  This has made working difficult, but not impossible.  Please ignore if these are normal reactions.  I&#39;m just not sure.

                                                BLOODY NOSE; BELL&#39;S PALSY; This spontaneous report received from a patient concerned a 73 year old female patient. The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included carotid surgery on 12-MAR-2021.  The patient received vaccination with JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE (covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s) (suspension for injection, route of admin intramuscular, batch number: 042A21A, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered to left arm on 02-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulfate for blood thinner. The patient reported no other symptoms or side effects after the vaccine.  Around 07-APR-2021, patient started getting Bell&#39;s palsy and went to the Emergency Room (ER) because she thought she was having a stroke. The patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy. The patient followed up with primary care provided on 12-APR-2021. Patient&#39;s Bell&#39;s palsy was not recovered completely but was almost gone. The patient had bloody nose on 13-APR-2021 and went to urgent care. The patient was told not to worry about it and &#39;it will probably never happen again&#39;.  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from bleeding from nose, and was recovering from bell&#39;s palsy. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This 73-year-old female patient experienced medically important Bell&#39;s palsy 5 days after receiving JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE (covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s) intramuscularly to left arm for prophylactic vaccination. The patient&#39;s had carotid surgery 21 days prior to the vaccination. Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulphate. The patient reported no other symptoms after the vaccination. She started to get Bell&#39;s palsy symptoms 5 days post vaccination and visited emergency room. She was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy. Details of symptoms, diagnosis, treatment were not reported. She followed up with primary care provider 10 days post vaccination and was seen with Bell&#39;s palsy &#34;almost gone&#34;. She was recovering from Bell&#39;s palsy. The patient experienced non-serious bloody nose the next day and had recovered.  Although information is limited, as there is no confirmatory epidemiologic/biologic evidence that vaccinations cause/contribute to the development of Bell&#39;s palsy, and the most common causes include viral infection and diabetes, the event is assessed to have an indeterminate causal association to immunization, per WHO causality classification for adverse events following immunization. Company causality for Bell&#39;s Palsy is considered not related to JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE.  Additional information has been requested for further assessment.

She underwent thrombectomy and angioplasty on 4/21 with no evidence of CAD elsewhere. She developed hypoxic respiratory failure evening of 4/21 and was found to have bilateral pulmonary embolus with saddle type emboli and distal emboli throughout both lungs. She underwent IR guided thrombectomy on4/22 and had a cardiac arrest intra-operatively. Given timing of onset and recent J&amp;J COVID vaccination, the patient was treated with IVIG, steroids, and placed argatroban. She continued to have multiorgan failure requiring mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis. On 4/26, CT head was positive for small area of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Patient was transitioned to comfort care measures and palliatively extubated on 4/26.

Now I&#39;m on an injectable blood thinner for the rest of my life and I was told it would take 3-4 months to resolve the blood clots.
