                                                12 hours after receiving the vaccine, I woke up in the middle of the night with severe chills, fever-like symptoms, a headache, and aches all over my body. I also was experiencing a heavy chest and shortness of breath. All but one of the adverse events went away after 24-36 hours - the shortness of breath and shallow breathing have persisted up through today. I am very aware of my breathing and how my chest feels tight, like I&#39;m not getting enough air.

                                                Patient was administered vaccine and told to wait the 15 minute monitoring period. After about 4 minutes, I heard her say &#34;I&#39;m not feeling right.&#34; I went to where she was sitting and asked &#34;are you ok?&#34; and had her take some slow, deep breaths. I then saw her eyes roll back and she lost consciousness. Thankfully, I was there and grabbed her as she toppled from the chair. I told the staff to call 911 and supported her neck and body in the chair. I could tell she was breathing and she was sweating profusely. I held her and spoke to her, and after about 15 seconds, she began to come out of it. After about a minute she was alert and orientated again.  I had her slowly sip a little water. The EMTs arrived in about 5 minutes and the assessed her vitals. She indicated that this was the first time anything like this had happened to her. They advised that since she had fainted, she should go to the hospital for observation, but she declined, stated that she felt fine at that point. Since she was driving, I insisted that she remain another one-half hour before leaving. During that time she drank more water and alternately sat and walked around the pharmacy. She did indicate that she had drank a protein shake that morning, but not eaten. I advised her to in the future, tell her doctor and/or any immunizer about the event. She left, stating that she was feeling fine, and I called her several hours later to make sure that she had indeed gotten home ok. She again said that she felt fine.

I then began to feel nauseous again and get extreme chills. I vomited multiple times, and was curled up in a fetal position crying from the nausea, headache, and a feeling of pressure in my chest. I ended up going to bed to sleep it off, waking up in a pool of sweat. I felt better the next day.

                                                I had a reaction within 25 mins of J&amp;J vaccine injection- my heart rate quickly went from 100 to 160 which is very abnormal for me and both of my hands were tingling (as were my feet). I felt a little dizzy and it was getting harder to breathe. It lasted for maybe 5- 10 mins and I had to try and do deep breathing techniques which helped a little. It has been almost 5 hours since my vaccine injection and I feel fine.

Felt lightheaded, dizzy, and hot. I began to black out, so I sat down, which helped for a few moments to subside lightheadedness. I was still feeling hot, so I walked a few feet to my back door and sat down on the steps outside to cool off. Within minutes, my vision blurred completely, I saw stars, and completely blacked out. My mother, who was nearby, heard me fall on the steps. She said my eyes rolled back, my body was completely limp, I was not breathing but rather making gurgling noises from my throat. She propped my head up, which allowed me to breathe properly, and I came to.   If my mother had not been nearby, I am convinced I would be dead right now. I saw the light, saw the other side, saw my relatives. I have had a near death experience once before, and this was exactly like that.

                                                I had the common symptoms within 24hrs of receiving the vaccine, including headache, body aches, body chills, fever, and tiredness, which lasted approximately 24hrs. I had taken both Adderall and Allegra that day. 4 days after receiving the vaccine, I took Adderall and Allegra and had an adverse reaction (I hadn&#39;t taken Adderall the prior 3 days). I experienced palpitations and vertigo/dizziness plus slight nausea. The next day, I took a much lower dose of Adderall and decided to continue taking approximately 1/3rd of my typical dose after an E-visit with my primary care Dr. During the week of 4/5, I was able to increase the dose by a little bit without any adverse reactions. Starting on 4/11, I was able to take 2/3rds of the typical dose without adverse reaction. However, I am still experiencing vertigo/dizziness, which may or may not be sinus-related due to seasonal allergies.

I am young still, used to walk a lot and also did hiking. I never had troubles with my leg joint until recently.

Tylenol was unhelpful but I had also taken my anxiety medication and 25mg of Benedryl, so the fact that it lasted roughly 4 hours is an estimation because i did eventually fall asleep.   Chest pain on 04/10/2021, ongoing but only sometimes excruciatingly painful. Had costochondritis about a year ago, it eventually went away. This pain is the same as that. I was told that people who get costochondritis are likely to get it again, so may be unrelated to the vaccine, but thought i would list it anyways.   General unwell feeling lasted until 04/13/2021  Unrelenting nausea lasted until 04/13/2021  Diarrhea started today 04/14/2021

The fever and chills lasted through the next day - body ache and soreness throughout both of those days. For those two days I did not work. (Ended the 8th when it was time for me to go to bed.) I did have heart palpitations the night of the 9th that I did go get ER  -they gave me a dose of Ativan and they sent me home. That took care of the heart palpitation symptoms.  I followed up with my provider the following week.

                                                At 3 am the night of the vaccine, I woke up with flu like symptoms, including a headache and shortness of breath. Two days later, I had a severe manic episode that lasted for three days (bipolar was well managed with medication at this point and I had not had a manic episode in months). Along with the manic episode, I developed chest pressure and shortness of breath, along with dizziness and a pounding sensation in my chest.  Any physical activity or even a sip of coffee sets my heart off. I am still experiencing these symptoms to this day and caused me to lose my job because I am not able to perform the required tasks. I had a premature atrial contraction prior to the COVID vaccine, but it had cleared up and I had been off of the medication for months with no problems.  I have been to the doctor&#39;s office (primary care physician-4/15/21 and 4/20/21) twice, the emergency room once (4/26/21), urgent care (4/14/21), and now am seeing a cardiologist for this condition (first visit 4/29/21).

The pharmacist/doctors at CVS gave me some water and told me to elevate ny legs. After 10 minutes they checked my termperature and blood pressure. I stabized somewhat and when home. I was sure it it was my nerves but something did feel right. I had a slight burning in my chest and felt queezy on/off throughout the day. Chills and hot flashes followed. I was anxious and paranoid about the possibility something serious coukd be wrong with me. I felt shooting pains in my lower left abdomen that nught and the next day. The following day I still felt very weak. My arm hurt. My muscles felt like jello and I?m unhappy. I wish I never got the shot and I?m worried about my body?s reaction to it.

                                                Around 4 pm I had flu like symptoms. Headache, back pain, fatigue, chills, sweats.  Around 5:30 I started feeling light-headed. I got out of bed and fainted on the floor. Laid there for a few moments. Got water. Laid back into bed and my body completely locked up. It felt like there were pins and needles coursing through my entire body. I couldn?t bend or move my legs. My wrists were bent down and my fingers all locked together. I could not move them at all. I was screaming out in pain. It was the worst pain I?ve ever felt. My roommate called 911. Paramedics arrived and took my temperature and blood pressure. They tried calming me down. eventually I did. And my fingers and legs unlocked but I continued having a severe headache, back pain, muscle aches and nausea. I woke up every hour of the night and threw up several times.  It?s been 24 hours after the shot and I am still having headaches fatigue and muscle spasms.

After about 5-10 minutes the patient stated she was very nauseous. I went to grab a trash can for her and within the 20 seconds or so it took to grab she had what seemed like a single muscle spasm or convulsion then she slid out of her chair onto the floor. She was breathing and coherent right away however she did not remember getting on the floor. Called 911 and EMS came out and took her vitals. She stated she felt fine afterward and did not go with them.

                                                At 10pm on 5/18/2021 I started having side effects, 9 hours after vaccination. My face and ears were hot and my body was cold, I felt very fatigued. I took Tylenol before bed and woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat. I woke up officially at 8am and felt my face and eyes were swollen, I also had chest tightness. I looked in the mirror and it looks like I was punched in the face. My left eye (the side I was vaccinated) is significantly more swollen than my right side. Since 8am, the swelling and puffiness hasn?t gone down in my face, however, the chest tightness went away. I took Benadryl. It is now almost 4pm on 5/19/2021 and I still have the same amount of swelling and puffiness in my face. It?s extreme enough that I can?t go out in public like this or else someone will think I got beat up. There isn?t any bruising, rather, under each eye there are very prominent dark circles with almost a reddish tint. It seems like this possibly could be an allergic reaction but after reading online it seems like allergic reactions would have happened right after vaccine. I noticed this side effect 19 hours after vaccination when I woke up on 5/19/2021. If it?s not better when I wake up tomorrow on 05/20/2021 I will goto urgent care.

                                                Likely pericarditis: I felt a stabbing pain in the area of my heart.  It felt like a papercut somewhat left of my ribcage directly on my heart--whenever I touched the area or moved in certain ways, there was the sharp pain.  This lasted for about 2.5 weeks and began likely the on April 17 (the date is a bit unclear, but it was within a week of my injection).  I was unsure whether this could be a symptom at the time, and I shied away from reporting, but recently saw that this is a rare but known symptom for individuals in my age range.

Got ultrasound on leg leg- nothing came back. My legs constantly hurting. Mainly behind my knees, side of my knee, and front of knee . My calves and ankles are also hurting. I feel pain, weaknesses, and throbbing. They are very tired. I visit a sports medicine doctor tomorrow.   Also visiting a cardiologist tomorrow. I?ve been having chest pains (which are normal for me prior to vaccine). However, now my heart is feeling like I?m having palpitations. It starts beating faster then normal. I can feel my heart beating now, which I?ve never been able to notice prior. I?m having to catch my breath often, and have to take really deep breaths.  This is the first time I?ve ever experienced these heart issues.  Visits since vaccine- 2 visits to PCP, 2 visits to urgent care, ultra sound, upcoming sports medicine visit, upcoming cardiologist visit

                                                Patient walked into the pharmacy trying to get vaccinated for Covid. Before anything patient was concerned about her previous Covid positive case (not a severe reaction, was eventually tested negative in April) and also her family history of asthma (Patient herself never had an episode so far). I told the patient it would be okay to get vaccinated, per CDC guideline.  As patient filled out the consent form, I checked the screening questionnaire, which she answered &#34;no&#34; to everything except &#34;don&#39;t know&#34; to asthma related questions.  As everything was set I brought patient into the consultation room, explained what vaccine she is receiving, how long it takes for the vaccine to be fully incorporated into her defense system (2-3 weeks), and what kind of side effects she can expect (muscle pain, elevation in body temperature, redness around injection site). I took extra moments to explain risk vs benefits for blood clotting issue.  At this point patient was ready to get vaccinated. I wore gloves, asked patient to roll her sleeves up so I can proceed to wipe the right upper arm area with alcohol and give her an injection. she followed promptly so far to this point.  As soon as patient received the vaccination, her body started to slide down the chair. Patient reported to feel dizzy and also reported that she had some &#34;dreams.&#34; Fortunately while everything was happening patient&#39;s head did not hit anything and patient was in sitting position the whole time of the event. I asked patient if patient was feeling okay three to four times but I did not get any straight answer from the patient. I asked for help, and pharmacy technicians and store manager offered help.  Patient wanted us to call her husband and 911, which we proceeded. In the mean time I also reached out to my district manager to report what was going on. Store manager offered a room temperature water to keep her fluid balanced, as she was sweating heavily.  Once 911 got to the site, they measured her BP and HR, and it was a bit low. 911 offered a choice to take patient to ER, which PT and her husband first decided to use their own car, and later decided against going to ER. Husband reported that patient is feeling much better, drank a few ounces of fluid and taken a banana.

I then made an appointment with my PCP for the following day. They did a EKG and I was diagnosed with Mobitz type 2, but he referred me to a Cardiologist. Cardiologist Dr had me do a stress test and wear a holter monitor for 2 weeks, that confirmed my original diagnosis of Mobitz type 2 block, which ended in me having to get a pacemaker on 6/14.

I ended up in the emergency room and being admitted to the hospital twice over the next week and a half. I have been trialing medications, wearing compression socks, and drinking a lot of water and eating a lot of salt. My symptoms have improved a little but my doctors believe I will be managing this for life (or at least a while).   Prior to this episode, I got the Janssen vaccine which caused me to have tachycardia for about 12 hours within the first 24 hours. I felt fine for a week but the second week I felt very fatigued and couldn&#39;t do much other than sit on the couch for the week.

But I&#39;m type 1 diabetic and my blood sugars have been at dangerously high levels for 3-4 days now. They still haven&#39;t gone down. I&#39;ve been taking two times as much long acting insulin as I usually take, tripling the amount of fast acting insulin I usually take, and am only eating protein and vegetables (no carbs) to try to keep my sugars in normal range, and even then they are stubbornly sticking around 250  to 400. I want doctors and patients to be aware of this side effect because it was really scary for me and it still hasn&#39;t resolved itself.

Sunday was dizziness, aches, nausea and cramping in left leg. Monday was nausea, aches, tingling in hands and feet, headache, brain fog. Tuesday I woke up with major imbalance and needed to use walls to walk without falling over. Dizziness subsided after some time to only rapid movements. I had a warm burning sensation in left leg with tingling hands and feet. Moderate headache. Reports came out of stopping the Janssen vaccine so I contacted my doctor with my symptoms and they ordered blood tests for clots.

                                                Patient received Janssen COVID19 vaccine at 10:15am. Upon receiving vaccine she sat down on chair to wait for 15 minutes post-vaccination. Just minutes after sitting down patient lost consciousness, fell from chair, hit her head on the floor, seize for a short moment, only to momentarily regain consciousness,  and faint for a second time.  EMS were called and patient was transported to Emergency Department for testing and observation. Patient believes she fainted the first time due to not having eaten much by that point in the day and due to anxiety about receiving the vaccine, and she was told she fainted a second time due to hypotension. She states she has a history of previously fainting during other medical procedures, though no similar previous reactions she can recall after vaccines.

                                                On 03/18/2021 at 03:30AM I had a lot of arm pain from my shoulder to my elbow in my left arm. This lasted until 03/31/2021.  On 03/18/2021 I woke up with a headache that would not go away. Next, at about 03:15PM I was not able to walk for about 10 minutes. Then, at about 05:00PM I started menstruating. At 07:00PM I had severe pain in my pelvic area for an hour and a half. At approximately 08:30PM I passed a softball sized blood clot vaginally.  I bled heavily through the night.  On 03/19/2021 I still had a headache and no energy at all. I continued to bleed heavily all day as well. 03/20/2021 was the exact same as the days prior. 03/21/2021 I was still bleeding heavily throughout the day with no energy. I still had the headache as well. I started feeling dizzy while walking on this day.  03/22/2021 I went to work like normal. I was cold all day. I was still bleeding, headache and dizziness. It was hard to stand for 30 minutes. While climbing the stairs I got very light headed and dizzy. I could not go up the stairs at a normal pace. 03/23/2021 I had the same symptoms all day but I was getting short of breath walking short distances. I still had very little energy and a headache. I also lost all color in my face and hands. I was still cold all day. I noticed some slight swelling in my ankles.  03/24/2021 The symptoms were getting more intense. I was still cold.  I finally took some aspirin for the headache because it was very severe. The medication didn&#39;t help with it. This routine went on for the next week and the symptoms intensified with each day. Throughout this time I was still passing clots that ranged in size from golf/ping pong ball to baseballs. They were very painful when they passed.  The days from 03/25/2021 to 04/01/2021 were all the same as far as how I felt.  On 04/02/2021 I woke up with the same symptoms but now I could not stay awake for anything. I slept on and off all day. I only ate one meal a day because I was so tired and I had no appetite. The headache was getting worse as the days went on. The bleeding was still happening. It was not as heavy as the weeks before, but enough to be painful still. I also started having abdominal pain.  On 04/03/2021 I was seeing stars when I moved too quickly. My heart rate was elevated with shortness of breath along with the rest of the previous symptoms. My headache however was very intense.  04/04/2021 I still couldn&#39;t stay awake on top of all the other symptoms. The dizziness and stars were more frequent. I couldn&#39;t move my head without seeing stars.  04/05/2021 I couldn&#39;t get warm and I still felt the same way. I called and made a doctor?s appointment for Wednesday the 7th. I had all the same symptoms still and they were getting worse. I had to move in slow motion so I could try to function.  04/06/2021 I woke up drained of all my energy and color. I couldn&#39;t shower because of the pain in my body. I couldn&#39;t stand because I felt like I was going to fall down. I could barely stand up straight let alone walk very far. I was shaking from being so cold. I had all the same symptoms from the days prior. I was in severe pain. I couldn&#39;t sit because of the pain in my abdomen I couldn&#39;t stand because of the weakness in my legs. I could barely see anything because of the stars I was seeing. At this point I had no color and I was barely conscious. That is when my family took me to the emergency room.

(The day before I had presented the common symptoms such as fever, chills, arm pain, muscle pain) however this symptom was off the list, at 11:30 in the morning I had to go to an emergency clinic, they checked me with blood test, urine tests, medical exam, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray. The doctor told me that everything was fine that I could leave. I had to pay a high bill at the hospital. The following 7 days the sensation was disappearing very slowly. However from day 8 it started again, until now on day 13, I still having sensation of shortness of breath when doing physical exercise, it is something that lasts and does not disappear.

                                                a 27 y.o. female with a history of Covid infection December 26, 2020, positive covid test December 29, 2020. She had approximately 2 weeks of symptoms including generalized body ache and generalized weakness.  Fatigue and some headache.  Had some persistence of symptoms after that time.  Had some benefit from ibuprofen.   Was seen at emergency room on January 27, 2021 stating that she felt that all her symptoms of Covid had resolved except for some chest pain which awoke her on January 27.  She presented to the emergency room.  Had sinus tachycardia at 113 but otherwise unremarkable physical exam, laboratory studies with white blood count elevated 16,004-20, hemoglobin 13.7 g hematocrit 41.8%, MCV 87.1, RDW 12.7%, platelet count 329,000, segs 72.8%, lymphs 20.6%, monocytes 4%, eosinophils 1%, basophil 0.6%.  BUN 10.1, creatinine 0.8, AST 24, ALT elevated 56, alkaline phosphatase 68, total protein 7.6, total bilirubin 0.3, albumin 3.6, globulin by subtraction 4.0, troponin less than 0.02, D-dimer quantitative 0.22, urine pregnancy test normal.  Chest x-ray normal.  Chest pain appears to be musculoskeletal and was reproduced by palpation of her chest wall.  No evidence of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.  D-dimer was normal.  Heart rate returned to normal after some intravenous fluids.  Patient discharged on Zithromax 500 mg day 1 and then to 50 mg days 2 through 5.  Also continued on ibuprofen.   Received Johnson and Johnson vaccine April 5, 2021.  Over the next week patient started having increasing soreness.  Her joints hurt more than usual and her headache was worse.  She had a sensation that her legs were &#34;numb and tingly&#34; starting at her buttocks and extending down her leg.   Because of reported incidence of cerebral sinus thrombosis or cerebral vein thrombosis patient appropriately presented for screening in the emergency room and was sent for appropriate imaging.   April 16, 2021 CT scan of head with and without contrast no acute intracranial hemorrhage, no mass-effect or midline shift.  On contrast-enhanced images there appears to be a lobular nonocclusive filling defect in the far lateral right transverse sinus.  Lobular occlusive filling defect is also likely present in the mid to central right transverse sinus.  Short segment filling defect in the medial left transverse sinus.  Remainder of sinuses and internal cerebral veins are patent.  Focal lobular filling defect within the confluence of the right and transverse sinus most likely related to arachnoid granulation.  No edema hemorrhage of the cerebellum or cerebrum.  No other significant findings.   April 16, 2021 confirmatory MRI angiogram of head without contrast with no restricted diffusion to suggest acute or subacute infarct.  Contrast void in the middle to central right transverse sinus consistent with occlusive thrombus.  Nonocclusive thrombus in the far lateral right transverse thrombus.  Narrowing of the medial left transverse sinus without complete occlusion.   April 16, 2021 2345 hrs. inital hematology consultation.  D-dimer and fibrinogen levels have been requested stat and are still pending.  If fibrinogen level is low will replace with cryoprecipitate.  If D-dimer is elevated barely confirms diagnosis of possible vaccine related thrombosis.  The fact the patient is not thrombocytopenic at this time is encouraging, however despite the lack of thrombocytopenia she still has clearly documented symptomatic nonocclusive and occlusive thrombus in her cerebral sinus.   From UPtoDate.com Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, also referred to as the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine) ? On April 13, 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended pausing administration of AD26.COV2.S  to further investigate rare cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and thrombocytopenia [33]. As of that date, six cases had been reported, all in females aged 18 to 48 years with onset 6 to 13 days after vaccination; during this period, 6.8 million doses were administered (with 1.5 million doses in females of that age range) [121-123]. Since some vaccine recipients have not been followed for longer than the time frame over which these symptoms develop, the incidence may change with additional follow-up. Initial symptoms included headache, backache, chills, and fatigue, and progressed to focal neurologic deficits. Intracerebral hemorrhage and thromboses at other sites were also seen in some patients. All of the five patients who were tested for the anti-PF4 HIT antibody tested positive. Another case, in a young male who was a vaccine recipient in one of the pre-emergency use authorization efficacy trials, had been previously reported. These cases appear similar to those reported following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222, another adenovirus-vector vaccine. Although rare, the observed number of events exceeded the expected rate among females &lt;50 years old. Given the extreme rarity of these events, the FDA and CDC acknowledge that they recommended the pause out of an abundance of caution and to ensure awareness of these rare events.    ?Evaluation and management of possible thrombotic complications ? Recipients should be aware of the possible association and seek immediate care for signs and symptoms suggestive of thrombocytopenia (eg, new petechiae or bruising) or thrombotic complications (including shortness of breath, chest pain, lower extremity edema, persistent severe abdominal pain, unabating severe headache, severe backache, new focal neurologic symptoms, and seizures) [117]. In such cases, some experts suggest evaluation with complete blood count and differential (including the platelet count), quantitative D-dimer, HIT testing, and imaging of any suspected site of thrombosis [113,114,125]. Onset 4 to 20 days after vaccination, platelet count &lt;150,000/microL, elevated D-dimer, and a positive anti-PF4 antibody (HIT antibody) suggest the diagnosis. Treatment with a non-heparin/non-warfarin anticoagulant (eg, argatroban or direct oral anticoagulant) and intravenous immune globulin has been suggested. The CDC recommends not using heparin in individuals with thromboses following receipt of Ad26.COV2.S unless HIT testing is negative [126]. (See &#34;Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&#34; and &#34;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&#34;, section on &#39;Terminology and HIT variants&#39; and &#34;Management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&#34;, section on &#39;Role of IVIG&#39;.)   As stated above all the 6 cases were &#34;all in females aged 18 to 48 years with onset 6 to 13 days after vaccination&#34; this would certainly fit the timeframe that we are seeing in this case.  Recommendations from national guidelines would be to start treatment with dexamethasone immediately while awaiting intravenous gammaglobulin.  To pursue intravenous gammaglobulin treatment at 1 g/kg over 1 to 2 days.  It is recommended to avoid heparin and instead use direct factor X inhibitor such as Eliquis, which this patient is already been started on.     There is unfortunately considerable risk that even though patient&#39;s symptoms appear mild at this time, that she may deteriorate in the very near future and I would recommend treating her aggressively at this time with dexamethasone and intravenous gammaglobulin while we are awaiting further testing.  Patient clearly has had unusual thrombosis, especially in a 27-year-old.     With the fact that she had headache dating back to January, it is impossible to determine the acute versus chronic nature of her venous sinus thrombosis. Covid infection does cause increase in coagulation as well.  However, given the small risk of tragic outcome with cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis in the setting of Covid vaccinations, we will proceed aggressively with treatment starting tonight with intravenous gammaglobulin and intravenous dexamethasone.     Will require rapid fasting glucoses to evaluate possible hyperglycemia from high-dose dexamethasone.  Will consider stopping dexamethasone at 48 hours.  Current recommendation for gammaglobulin would be single 1 g/kg or 500 mg/kg over 2 days.  No recommendations for treatment beyond this point.  Current recommendations for gammaglobulin dosing would recommend using an adjusted dose for patients with greater than 125% of their ideal body weight.  This patient at 122 kg on a 5 foot 2 inch frame does qualify for adjusted dose and her orders reflect that.   I appreciate the opportunity see this patient this evening and consultation requested by Dr.  We will follow patient in hospital.  Hopefully she will have gradual improvement and avoid any serious or tragic complications of her cerebral sinus thrombosis.     We will have pharmacy report possible adverse reaction to Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine to the FDA as required by law.   April 17, 2021 follow up. No new events.  Laboratory studies remained excellent.  White blood count is further elevated, however, this may be secondary to high-dose dexamethasone with a white blood count of 16,060.  Hemoglobin 14.0 g hematocrit 42.8%, MCV 86.8, RDW 12.9%.  Platelet count is actually increased slightly at 374 as of 9:10 AM this morning.  Differential shows left shift as expected with dexamethasone.  Results from yesterday showed fibrinogen normal at 369 (180?415) pro time normal at 10.4 seconds with INR of 0.97, PTT 26.7.  D-dimer 0.23 (0.19?0.50).  With platelet count, fibrinogen and D-dimer normal I am inclined to believe that this is not an acute post vaccination HIT-like phenomena.  If it were I would still expect to see some degree of thrombocytopenia elevated D-dimer and perhaps low fibrinogen.  The other explanations for her cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are either idiopathic spontaneous and merely coincidentally associated at the exact same time as her Covid infection or more likely, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis secondary to hypercoagulable state secondary to her Covid infection from December 2020.  Unfortunatly there is no way to accurately date the acuity of the venous thrombosis in her cerebral sinus.  HIT Testing is still pending and most likely will not be available for 3-4 more days despite being ordered stat.  Have called the laboratory and asked them to check with our outside reference lab what the expected return time is on this test. (LabCorp says &#34;Tuesday April 20, 2021).  Patient refused intravenous gammaglobulin infusion which has been ordered last night.  Patient has been receiving dexamethasone which was a bridge until intravenous gammaglobulin could be administered.  Current guidance from the expert hematology panel (EHP) on Covid vaccine induced thrombosis dated April 7, 2021 from the  public health would state that a patient who has a reduced platelet count without thrombosis with a D-dimer normal and normal fibrinogen or thrombosis with a normal platelet count and D-dimer normal and normal fibrinogen are &#34;unlikely cases&#34;.  They recommend for probable cases who have D-dimers that are elevated to send HIT assay and then give immediate intravenous gammaglobulin while awaiting results.  They recommend fibrinogen supplementation, if needed.  They recommend a direct acting antithrombin agents such as the Eliquis this patient is receiving.  They recommend steroids particularly if there is a delay in getting intravenous gammaglobulin delivered.  With the fact that we now have 24 hours in the hospital with no evidence of thrombocytopenia, no evidence of increased fibrinolytic activity or active thrombosis, and no evidence of hypofibrinogenemia, I would argue that her presentation is subacute.  In this setting, I do not feel intravenous gammaglobulin would be necessary and does involve a small risk as well as considerable cost.  Dexamethasone also involves small risk and negligible cost. I have discontinued both of these medications.  My overall impression would be that this was not related to her Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination which was recent, but rather her more distant Covid infection.  It is impossible to definitively answer the question however.  The next question is duration of anticoagulation.  Risk of recurrent cerebral sinus venous thrombosis is relatively small but the morbidity can be high.  Studies have been performed showing medications in the same class as Eliquis have been associated with a decrease in incidence of the recurrence.  Most hematologist recommend 3 months of anticoagulation for provoked venous thrombosis including cerebral sinus venous thrombosis.  I feel this patient&#39;s thrombosis is &#34;provoked&#34;, with her association at the same time of her Covid infection (and possibly vaccination).  I would recommend Eliquis (apixaban) 5 mg twice daily or Xarelto (rivaroxaban) 20 mg daily with food. I would feel comfortable in discharging patient for outpatient follow up IF Dr and other speciality services agree. Plan 3 months of full dose anticoagulation with direct factor X inhibitor.   Circulation 2010 Jun 29;121(25):2740-6 &#34;Long-term evaluation of the risk of recurrence after cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis&#34;, Background: The clinical course of cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis (CSVT) is largely unknown because prospective studies with a long follow-up and with the goal to assess thrombosis recurrence rate and predisposing factors for recurrence are lacking. Methods and results: One hundred forty-five patients with a first CSVT were followed up for a median of 6 years after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment. End points were recurrent CSVT or other clinical manifestations of venous thromboembolism. CSVT recurred in 5 patients (3%) and other manifestations of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism) were seen in 10 additional patients (7%), for a recurrence rate of 2.03 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 1.16 to 3.14) for all manifestations of venous thromboembolism and 0.53 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 1.10) for CSVT. Nearly half of the recurrences occurred within the first year after discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy. Risk factors for recurrent venous thrombosis were male sex (adjusted hazard ratio, 9.66; 95% confidence interval, 2.86 to 32.7) and, for thromboses other than CSVT, severe thrombophilia resulting from antithrombin, protein C, protein S deficiency, anti-phospholipid antibodies, or combined abnormalities (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.34 to 16.5). Conclusions: The risk of recurrent CSVT is low and is higher in the first year after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment and among men. Mild thrombophilia abnormalities are not associated with recurrent CSVT, but severe thrombophilia entails an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism.   April 19, 2021 Follow up, no change in condition. Discussed case with Dr, will order Factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, anti phospholipid and anti cardiolipin antibodies, if she will allow draw. Expect Heparin Induced Thrombosis testing result tomorrow, but with no thrombocytopenia after given heparin, expect will be normal. Will await result. If discharged, would recommend 3 months direct thrombin inhibitor (Eliquis/Xarelto/Pradaxa) at full anticoagulation dose. Then stop, no taper. Overall still feel &#34;provoked&#34; thrombosis due to December Covid, unrelated to J&amp;J Covid vaccine, but can not definitively prove that..

Further history obtained included decreased exercise tolerance since four weeks prior to presentation (noticeable during runs). She was found to have an abnormal EKG at an urgent care and was sent to an outside hospital emergency department. She ultimately was found to have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (56%), Stage C, Class III,  and myocarditis. The highest suspicion for the etiology of her myocarditis is viral vs. autoimmune (given response to steroids) vs. genetically-mediated myocarditis. She was discharged on aspirin, a prednisone taper, colchicine, metoprolol, and Entresto with cardiology follow-up. Patient discharged with 4 week monitor to monitor for arrhythmia as per EP service. Infiltrative cardiomyopathy evaluation pending as well- plan for SPEP/UPEP, serum/urine protein electrophoresis, immunofixation, and alpha-galactosidase (not sent due to specific tube not available).

They kept me at the hospital for 2-3 days. I also had migraines and taking anti convulsion medication. They performed MRI, EEG&#39;s, CT scans and all my exams came back within normal limits.

She received her first COVID vaccine 8 hours prior. No cough. She felt well before the shot. No bleeding or leaking fluid. Her COVID test was negative. She was tachycardic to the 140&#39;s and the baby was tachycardiac to the 180&#39;s starting at presentation. She was treated with oral tylenol and IV fluids. After about 90 minutes of monitoring a prolonged fetal heart rate deceleration was noted to the 60&#39;s for 6 minutes. This recovered with repositioning. After another hour a reactive tracing was noted with a normal heartrate for baby. In induction of labor was started.

                                                After receiving the shot, I was required to sit down for 15 minutes. About 5 minutes in, I started to become dizzy, my vision started blacking out, my hearing was muffled, I became clammy, sweaty, and experienced mental disorientation. It became harder for me to breathe, but I never struggled to take a breath. I drank some water and waited for the symptoms to subside. I remained seated and these symptoms went away within 5 minutes. After feeling better for about 5 minutes, I felt cold and was shivering. The woman sitting next to me was completely fine after her shot. I&#39;ve since felt a slight burning sensation on my skin in areas that I have scratched lightly. I&#39;m also experiencing strange feelings throughout my body- specifically my head, leg, and hand. It feels like I can feel something in each area for a bit and then it subsides after several minutes.

PT with her mother, became light-headed and dizzy while walking from vaccination site back to vehicle for 15 minute wait. PT became unresponsive with mother and fainted.  Parking staff alerted rapid response team, PT regained responsiveness and was given chair to sit on, water to drink.  Rapid response team arrived to a responsive, A&amp;Ox4, pale female who was still feeling weak and light-headed.  PT was transferred to a cot (in the shade) where she was placed in supine position with legs elevated on a chair.  Pt was given water and hard candy to suck on while vitals were taken,,  Airway, breathing and circulation were all WNL.     PT states she presently has a strep infection (throat area)  and has been afebrile, and is to begin oral antibiotics once she picks RX up from pharmacy.     PT began feeling significantly better over 10-15 minutes of laying down in the shade.    EMS LAFD was called and transfer of care to EMS Station 93 for further work-up was instituted.  PT felt much better and was able to stand and ambulate from cot to EMS vehicle without issue.    PT chose to go home with her mother instead of being transported by EMS to medical facility.

After 5 minutes of waiting the patient slumped over and passed out onto the floor.  Her color was very pale and her eyes were rolling in the back of her head.  She regained consciousness but her color was still poor and we called and ambulance because she was still feeling faint.  The  EMT&#39;s immediately took her blood pressure and it was extremely low.  She acknowledged that she did not eat or drink anything at all that morning.  The EMT&#39;s recommended she go to the hospital but she refused.  After 30 minutes with emergency personnel she felt better and well enough to leave with her family member who was with her.

The shaking (extremely bad, could not control my own muscles at all and I had to lay on my arms so they wouldn&#39;t flail out) and racing heart lasted about five hours. The headache and all over muscle pain finally eased up last night. Breathing aches and I am still experiencing muscle weakness.

                                                The week prior to delivery (3/22), I started feeling shortness of breath and a headache. I thought it was just normal pregnancy symptoms. That Friday (3/26), I noticed swelling in my ankles. I am a teacher so I asked my school nurse to check my blood pressure; it was high (for me) around 144/88. She said I should call my OB and let them know. I did, and they said to rest for the weekend and they&#39;d see me on Tuesday for my 29 week appointment.   We had a weekend trip planned. We took our son there. The next night, I didn&#39;t feel right. My belly felt hard to me and I wasn&#39;t feeling my daughter move as much, but soon after, I went to sleep. Our two year old son woke us up crying around midnight, and I noticed that I started bleeding when I went to the bathroom. My husband drove me straight to the emergency room. I was diagnosed with sudden and severe preeclampsia. My fibrinogen levels were 100% indicative of a placental abruption. They called the transport team in from hospital so they could transfer my daughter immediately after birth. At 5:57 am on 3/28, my daughter was born via emergency c-section. She is currently fighting everyday at the NICU in the hospital.  On Friday, 4/2 I was readmitted for severe preeclampsia to hospital. My blood pressure was 190/115. I had to receive another round of magnesium sulfate. I was released from the hospital on Sunday, 4/4.

I started feeling nauseous about an hour later. Then at about 9:00 pm, I started to feel really sick. I felt very tired and my whole body hurt. I had a low body temperature, 95 degrees. Chills, fever, shaking, nausea. Very SEVERE symptoms. Felt very disoriented. I thought I was going to pass out and faint. Vision blurry and seen white.  Pounding headache. Ears ringing. I could hardly walk that night, I was crawling on the floor. I felt out of breath. My heart was beating very fast. My left side of my chest hurt by my ribs. When I did wake up from sleep, I woke up with blood in my mouth and dried blood on my lips.

                                                The day I received the shot, I started to feel severe fatigue, headache, light-headed, and started running a fever about 6 hours after the shot was administered.  The next day (4/6) was worse. Severe fatigue, muscle aches, headache, loss of appetite, fever (101.5 was the highest I notice but seemed to be around 101.1-101.3 all day), and general flu like symptoms. However, I also started experiencing abnormal menstrual bleeding. I am on the Depo shot and have been for some time. Due to this, I do not usually experience any menstrual bleeding so I found this to be a little odd. It was not heavy but it was noticeable and contained quite a few clots.   Day 3 (4/7) was about the same except my fever came down and ranged from 99.8-101.1. Abnormal menstrual bleeding continued. New side effect this day included diarrhea.   Day 4 (4/8) I started to see improvement. No fever (that I could tell). Remaining side effects included mild headache, fatigue, diarrhea, and abnormal menstrual bleeding.   Day 5 (4/9), I had one of the worst nose bleeds I&#39;ve ever had in my life. I apologize for the graphic description but it lasted about 20 minutes and my bathroom looked like a crime scene after. Blood was pouring out of my left nostril and I threw two large clots that were about the size of slug (or slightly larger than a fun size snickers... I wish I had a better way to describe it). I&#39;ve had some bad nose bleeds, particularly when I was on Accutane, and this was worse! The rest of the day I felt like I was improving. Energy levels were better. No fever. Menstrual bleeding stopped. Only lingering side effect was mild headache and mild diarrhea.   Since then I&#39;ve continued to feel better and the diarrhea seems like it&#39;s improving.  Mild headache persists. Only new  item is an annoying twitch in my left eye that started on Monday (4/12).

I was wearing a fitbit and then noticed my heart Rate went up to the 90s and fluctuated between 90-110 bpm all night into the next morning.  I woke up every 2 hours  to a new symptom on top of what I was feeling already. It started with chills, then sweating, nausea and  a headache. I had a fever of 99.5 at the highest. And then the last time I woke up at 5 my heart hurt so bad, my whole chest muscle hurt with a sharp pain and It hurt to breath.  The next day I had a little headache and my body hurt, and I had cramping in my legs for a few days, but I also started my menstrual cycle on the 13th.  The leg cramping continued for a few days but only when I sat on my legs for too long.

                                                I have severe, random, and unprovoked bruising covering both legs. I have abdominal pain that has persistent since being vaccinated. I?m dizzy. I?m bleeding in my urine, stool, and vaginally. Period came early (unrelated to previous vaginal bleeding) and is not clotting. Just significant amounts of red blood, soaking through one ultra absorbency tampon an hour. I have a headache. Went to the ER and my platelets were (345) and my blood sugar low. My bp was 145/90 which is high for me, from the bleeding.  They said I have a ?higher chance of being bitten by a shark? than having a side effect. They diagnosed me with a single contusion and sent me home. Have been feeling worse since leaving the hospital.

                                                On 7/2/2021, 28y.o. female patient presented to the pharmacy with her husband to receive their COVID-19 vaccines. Patient was checked in, screened and requested Janssen vaccine.  RPh stepped outside to speak with patient about the potential side effect risks with Janssen due to her age group but told patient ultimate decision of which vaccine to receive was her choice.  Patient stated she wanted to stick with Janssen and RPh then proceeded to review the questionnaire with patient that she had filled out online.  Patient answered no to all questions including the question about ever having a reaction, fainting or feeling dizzy after a vaccine. She was counseled by the pharmacist of potential side effects and how to treat at home or seek medical attention , v-safe program reporting, vaccine card, waiting 15 mins in pharmacy area to be monitored, etc. Her vaccine was administered at approximately 10:12 by rx tech and a wait time of 10:27 given to pt.    Work continued in the pharmacy and the patient and her husband were in the waiting area chairs in front of the pharmacy talking (per him, they were joking about side effects when she started to slump over and he thought she was playing around until she started falling backwards and he tried to catch her by her shirt). At approximately, 10:19, the pharmacist and techs heard a loud noise as patient experienced syncope falling backwards hitting the back of her head on the cement floor and the chair fell out from under her and crashing against the floor. Husband was by her side as RPh ran out to assist asking techs to close the pharmacy down for the medical emergency and to call 911 ASAP, call in around 10:19. Code white was called as well.    Assessment following Adv Events protocol: Patient was breathing and awake with dazed/glazed eyes as pharmacist started trying to ask questions to assess her conscious level.  After about 30-45 seconds pt came back around and answered name and DOB for pharmacist who was talking back and forth with 911 operator.  Patient answered that she felt hot, dizzy and anxious to rph who immediately had cold compresses (cool, wet paper towels) for patient&#39;s face and neck. Patient also stated that she had not had anything to eat since 7/1 PM as they had planned to grab breakfast after their vaccines.  Store managers arrived as well.  Local firefighters from the station just down the street were in the store doing their daily meal shopping and heard the call come across to EMS so they came back to the pharmacy to help.  They already had equipment in hand and recorded vitals while RPh was still attending to pt and 911 operator. at 10:24; bp:124/92, pulse 70, O2 sat: 98.  Patient stated she felt well enough to try to sit up in the chair again and get off the hard floor and was assisted up by firemen and husband.  One of the firemen and RPh assessed the back of the patient&#39;s head and no blood or knot was located, patient able to ambulate head and neck and no blood was found on the floor.  Patient still able to answer questions, knew where she was, what she had done except in the moment of fainting and knew who her husband was.  Patient refused to be transported to the hospital and EMS was cancelled by firemen to 911.  Firemen left scene.   Rph, rx tech and Assest Protection completed initial questioning for VAERS/SCRT, Incident and EOC contacted while patient and husband still present.  Patient asked for some water and was provided her wishes.  Rph continued to ask patient questions about how she was feeling as reports were being gathered. Patient stated she thought not eating and her anxiety got to her causing her to faint and still reported no previous issues with receiving vaccines.    Also counseled on signs/symptoms of a concussion, soreness to be expected over the next few days and to seek help immediately if any conditions worsened.  Patient was given RPh&#39;s card and told that she would be followed up with Friday PM at COB and Monday, but if anything changed between then to call RPh at the number on the business card.  Upon finishing reporting and standing, patient stated back of right knee was hurting from tangle with chair upon fall; otherwise felt fine just a little tired and laughing.  A wheelchair or electric cart was offered to patient upon leaving but she asked to walk out assisted by husband and was released.    Reporting: Pt meds tri-sprintec and lexapro 20mg, no allergies, only medical condition is anxiety, no PCP

                                                Patient was given 1 dose of the Jansen Covid Vaccine in the left deltoid by the administering intern. Within 30 seconds  the patient became light headed, dizzy and upon standing up,  then fainted. Intern notified the pharmacist on duty immediately. The RPh attempted to communicate with the patient of which she was unresponsive. RPh then informed technician to call 911. Patient was red in the face, arms and very hot upon touch. Patients eyes were open but was not lucid of responsive to questions. RPh then administered 1 dose of an Epi-pen. Patient immediately became responsive upon first Epi-Pen administration and was able to sit-up and communicate with pharmacy staff. Patient declined 911 services upon being informed of 911 being called. Patient was able to sit-up and talk stated that she was fine. Patient called her mother to come and get her from the pharmacy after resting for roughly 20min in the immunization room. Pharmacist on duty followed-up with patient about 4 hours later to check-in with how patient was doing. Patient stated she was a little jittery from the epi-pen but otherwise feeling fine. Due to the holiday, RPh told patient she would follow up with the patient and the patients primary care the following day (07/06/21), along with informing patient to also follow up with her Primary Care.

I thought it would end, but the chest pain and palpitations continued daily for the next 2 to 3 months. Afterwards, they would happen on occasion and still do to this date. In the first 2 to 3 months after receiving the vaccine, I would get so winded after walking from the train station or up stairs that I would have to stop. Many times throughout the day I had to stop what I was doing and not only rest but sleep. I was exhausted and felt overwhelming pressure around my heart and increased heart rate daily.

                                                Prior to shot, pt expressed anxiety about getting shots.  I used calming conversation during prep to calm her.  She received shot in the left deltoid muscle.  The patient continued to act anxious and cradled her head in her hands.  I asked, &#34;Are you ok?&#34;  My colleague offered water.  Shortly thereafter, the pt leaned to the side and fell off her chair, unconscious.  I was unable to catch her, and she fell and slumped against a partition.  I was able to rush over and prevent her from slumping to the concrete floor.  A colleague ran back to call 911. Pt had a pulse and was breathing.  About 30 seconds later the pt became conscious.  She did not want 911 to be called.  She simply wanted to rest in the shot booth with her friend.  We provided materials to lie down on.  Pt walked out with her friend about 20 minutes later.

                                                Abdominal pain began 7/29 and treatment for BV began 7/12. Thyroid panel on 7/9 showed high out of range T3 with TSH and T4 in healthy range. On 7/13 symptoms of heart palpitations, muscle weakness, vision distortion, and elevated blood pressure began suddenly during work. I have history of stroke caused by thyroid storms. Immediately took atenolol, a beta blocker, and called my endocrinologist to prescribe it for the next 30 days. Switched from armour thyroid back to levothyroxine. Atenolol has caused other side effects, heart palpitations are mild and not gone, menstrual cycle is highly irregular. Waiting 6 weeks from the change to levothyroxine for next thyroid panel, continuing atenolol until thyroid levels are in range.

Tingling fingers on hand from vaccination arm (left), swelling from vaccination injection site, headache, and neck pain all developed on 3/10/2021.  Headache and neck pain could be due to head trauma from vasovagal syncope. Tingling fingers were not observed on 3/11/2021.    *I have had vasovagal syncope in the past, but never with vaccines. It always occurs when I see my own blood.

                                                Around 8 hours after the shot I started to experience fatigue, body aches, uncontrollable body shakes, blueish lips and sweating (which to me indicated I had a fever). After taking some Advil my lips returned to normal and the body shakes stopped although it was hard to regulate my body temperature. I was sweating but felt cold. The worst of the symptoms seemed to last around 13 hours after they had started (so about 7pm on 3/25 to about 8am on 3/26). It&#39;s now been around 30 hours and I&#39;m feeling better but still fatigued and have soreness in my left arm where I received the injection.

All other symptoms gone 4/8 - Inflammation of welt partially faded but red irritation spread out like it was dispersing.

The fever got worse overnight and I woke up repeatedly with a higher than normal heart rate and a severe migraine that lasted throughout the next day. I took Tylenol (two doses, 12 hours apart) to some relief.

                                                Headache (turned into a migraine), extremely drained of energy, lack of appetite, and felt off all day (4/9/21). The next morning (4/10/21) felt the same as the day before, however, had several episodes where I would get really light headed, dizzy, and nauseous. Went to Home Depot at 2:15pm (4/10) and while there my vision blurred and started to fade, I had ringing in my ears and couldn?t hear out of the right and barely was able to hear out of the left. I got very nauseous and I couldn?t breath. I managed to sit on something and put my head between my legs that helped. Fortunately my step- dad was with me and helped me outside while I could barely see and hear and he stated I was very pale. I was having a hard time talking or being conherent. Once outside the symptoms slowly cleared over about the next 6-7 hours. At 4:45pm my mom decided to take me to the doctor but the walk in had just closed and I went to the ER. They stated I had elevated d-dime and did a chest CT scan  to check for blood clots around 7:30pm (I believe not sure exact time) doctor stated they came back clear but when asked if he suspected that the episode and symptoms were due to a dissipated blood clot he would not directly answer it. I overheard him dictating his notes and he started he beloved as such. I have never experienced anything like this before. I still felt drained, headache (migraine), occasionally dizzy, and lack of appetite (4/11/21, 4/12/21) and still currently feel the same drained, migraine, lack of appetite, and occasionally dizzy.

                                                Initial injection site felt a lot of pressure and at first there were mild symptoms of ringing in the ears and mind fogginess. Within 5 minutes after receiving injection I got up and walked less than 10 feet when I began experiencing extreme dizziness, ringing in the ears, lightheadedness, felt warm, and began to feel chills/tingling throughout my whole body but especially in my head.  I ended up passing out and was unable to sit up in a chair without assistance. For about 10 minutes I was profusely sweating all over my entire body, had continued chills/tingling, difficulty breathing and was semi coherent. The nurse at the pharmacy had me sniff ammonia salt and gave me water to help. I waited for 20 more minutes before finally feeling able to get up and walk around the store. Body chills and cold sweats continued for a while but no further symptoms at this time (2hrs after vaccination).

EMS came and took her blood pressure again and it was 110/80. She went to the hospital for further observation and they did an EKG and said everything was normal, and now she is feeling okay.

The patient immediately complained of feeling dizzy within seconds of completing the vaccination.  She slumped in her chair and was nonresponsive to me for about 45 seconds.  Color was very ashen. We treated patient by leaning her in the triangle position and she continued to talk to me at that point.  At 10 minutes patient felt fine and was drinking water.  She was observed for about 45 minutes total and felt fine when she left the pharmacy.  She kept stating she hates shots and was really worked up about getting the vaccine.

                                                In ED on 3/11 0246 with the following Chief complaint - I got the johnson and johnson covid vaccine 3/10 at 4pm and now I can&#39;t stop throwing up&#34;  c/o emesis, fever, body aches.  HR 140s. pt is A/O x3. &#43; nasuea, chills fever 101.2. denies throat swelling or SOB. pt presents with swelling at vaccine site and rash to both shoulder blades She does feel lightheaded and dizzy.  Denies any recent illnesses.  Denies any prior intolerance to vaccines. Fever 101.7F Patient has low-grade fever but nontoxic-appearing.   Blood work shows mild leukocytosis with left shift likely reactive otherwise within normal limits.   After 3 L of IV fluids she remains persistently tachycardic in the high 130s to 140s. Additional information for Item 18:  She states she was feeling fine prior to her vaccine, denies any recent illness, sick contacts, recent travel, CP, SOB, abd pain, dysuria. After eating and drinking patient states she feels a little nauseous and having some indigestion so was given some more Zofran and Maalox.   She continues to be presenting tachycardic in the 130s.   Given the rest of the reassuring ED work-up I think this is likely autoimmune response to the vaccine however given her current heart rate I cannot discharge her safely.   Will admit her to medicine team for observation.   SIRS, likely 2/2 vaccine - hold off on antibiotics for now without clear source of infection, procalcitonin negative - tylenol prn for fever   Principal Problem:   SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) Active Problems:   Tachycardia   Asthma  3/12 discharge summary She was given 3L IVF bolus in the ED -- still tachycardic in the 110s, fever has improved.  There was concern for adverse reaction to vaccine and she was given prednisone 60 mg x 1 in the ED.  Her symptoms have improved and she is able to tolerate PO without vomiting.  Of note, she says her entire family had a respiratory viral illness approx 1 year ago which her PCP suspected was COVID 19, but were unable to be tested at the time.     Fever has resolved, has been afebrile x24 hours, leukocytosis has resolved   tachycardia has improved although still HR in the 110&#39;s with ambulation, ordered an echo however patient did not want to stay wanted to follow-up with PCP and have this done there.   Vital signs have been stable, patient states back to her baseline and feeling great.  Would like to go home.

Within 5 minutes of receiving the shot I began to feel light-headed, lost consciousness and fell onto the floor and hit my head (according to a witness). I came to and there were staff members/medical personnel present and talking to me. I spoke with them and was immediately brought  to the emergency room for further examination. An EKG was administered and a urine sample was taken. Results were normal. I was given acetaminophen and ibuprofen and discharged.   Since being vaccinated on 06/28/2021 to today, 07/01/2021 I have experienced the following symptoms: muscle aches/soreness, headache, joint pain, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea

By morning the symptoms were gone except a felt very week and still had a mild headache. The headache got bad again by 10:00AM. And grew worse and worse until it was excruciating. I took 800mg of Advil, a muscle relaxant, and 2 hours later a Norco. Nothing reduced the pain. I stayed up and cried all night. I asked a relative to take me to the ER, but they were unwilling. In the early hours of the morning, it started to reduce. The next day I was weak, and I had a mild headache for the next 2 days.

                                                Before the shot the patient was very nervous.  5 Minutes later she lost consciousness in her chair but quickly recovered, with dizziness, tunnel vision, sweating, shivering, nausea, weakness. She got better with resting her head down by her knees, had some water, then stood up to go to the bathroom due to nausea, but didn&#39;t make it and vomited 2 times. After resting on the floor with pharmacist supervision for about 20  minutes she began to feel better. I called her boyfriend who came to pick her up. She did not want the ambulance.

A few minutes later she fainted and fell out of the chair onto the floor. We helped her up to a sitting position and gave her a bottle of water and an ice pack.  The right side of her forehead appeared red from apparent hit on the floor when she fainted.  We had her wait on the floor for about 30 minutes to ensure she remained conscious.  Patient reported an ache on her forehead at site of hit.  She was also sweating and reported feeling hot. Patient had a partner with her who agreed to escort her to an urgent care clinic in the same building as the pharmacy. Store manager in charge took the patient to the urgent care clinic by wheelchair to be examined.

                                                Approximately 10 hours after injection I became tachycardic--on average experienced a heart rate of 100-120 bpm (resting hearting rate is 65-70 bpm) which continued for 6 hours.  This occurred at the same time as fever (highest 99.4 degrees F) and muscular aches in back and legs. After consulting with doctor, I took a combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen and  half a dose of  metoprolol to lower fever and heart rate.

Concerned my bone was hit with a too long vaccine needle. Had chills/fever evening of 4/4/2021 into morning of 4/6/2021?had to take off work. Have had neurological symptoms ongoing with ?brain fogginess? since 4/5/2021. On 4/6/2021, began to see flashes/spots of light in vision of left eye, which worsened through today. Took off afternoon from work and went to an eye clinic to have eye dilated and looked at, but the spots in vision continue through reporting time (4/7/2021, 5pm CT).

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I began to feel nauseous, almost like being car sick while looking at my phone. I also began to feel tightness in my chest. After my 15 minutes were up I asked the administrator of my shot if it was normal that I felt dizzy/chest tightness. They said it was probably fine and just to monitor my  symptoms. I went and sat in my car a few min and I began to feel very strange, it seemed very bright out, I felt weak, and my eyes felt very heavy. I wanted to get home so I started driving but on the highway, my heart beat was very fast and I began to feel like I couldn&#39;t swallow. At one point felt as though I might be about to choke so I pulled over because I thought I was going to have to dial 911 as my throat was feeling like it was closing up. I tried swallowing a few times with great effort and after a few minutes the sensation started to lessen. My throat hadn&#39;t closed up completely, however it did feel like it had swelled up.

Her face turned white, and I could tell she was feeling faint.  We assisted her to a safe place to lie down.  A physician on duty at the clinic attached to the pharmacy examined her. We sat in the room with her for several more minutes.  She started feeling better after about 10 minutes and was able to stand with no problem.  We had her call her spouse to pick her up.

Immediately after being vaccinated, pt. requested to remain seated.  The nurse noted that the pt. was getting pale so she suggested the pt. take off the surgical mask to get some air.  Before pt. had a chance to take off the mask she lost consciousness.  Together with another nurse patient was lowered onto the floor.  Pt. regained consciousness for 30-45 seconds and then began to have seizure like activity.  Her eyes rolled back and her body became stiff and began a jerking motion.  911 was called. This seizure like activity lasted 4-6 seconds at which time pt. regained consciousness and immediately sat up.  Pt was pale and diaphoretic.  BP 98/64, HR 78, Pulse Ox 99%.  Pt vomited multiple times.  Ice was applied to the posterior neck and a cold compress to the forehead .  EMS arrived and took vitals: BP 78/40.  Pt. was aware of person, place and situation.  Pt. was taken to Hospital accompanied by her husband.  Pt was called by me Friday and she was home.  All tests showed no sign of having a seizure.

Woke up with severe chills / teeth chattering / uncontrollable shivering, my husband said my body was warm but I felt chilled to the bone.  Finally got warm enough to fall asleep around 2am.  The next day, more chills, headache, fatigue, and general malaise all day.  Started feeling better on the third day.  Today, tightness in right side of chest--not sure if related, will be calling the doctor.

                                                The adverse symptoms I experienced were abnormally severe/heavy menstrual bleeding and abdominal pain. I was on Day 4 of my menstrual cycle on the day of my injection (April 3, 2021). My menstrual cycle usually starts to go away on Day 4 and concludes by Day 7. But the day after my injection, in addition to experiencing the common side effects of fever, chills, aches, and headaches, I also experienced an uptick in bleeding, which included severe/heavy menstrual bleeding with very frequent and large blood clots. That same day (April 4), I started my new birth control cycle as prescribed. By Day 8 (April 7, 2021), my menstrual bleeding continued to be so severe/heavy that I went to my OB-GYN for testing. The OB-GYN ruled out everything but the vaccine as an environmental factor. It was suggested that I take 600mg of Motrin every 6-hours for 48 hours. My menstrual bleeding continued for several more days until concluding on Day 12 (April 11, 2021) but I am still experiencing abdominal pain.

Laying down heart rate was between 115-120 I got my injection, a few minutes later my heart was fast, but I left anyway. My heart was fast through the day, but manageable. At night I fell asleep, and woke up 1.5 hours later to a heart rate of 123. I got up to use the bathroom and could barely breathe because it jumped to 140 while walking the 10 feet to the bathroom.  My heart stayed that fast until the morning

                                                On April 16, 2021 (Day 13 after Vaccine) I was diagnosed with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of my femoral vein in my left leg by Hospital. In other words, I was diagnosed with a blood clot in my upper left leg. Pain in both my legs had started on April 13, 2021 (Day 10 after Vaccine). On April 16, I had a virtual appointment with my doctor, Dr. , who prescribed an ultrasound to rule out DVT.  I went to an ultrasound appointment at  Radiology at 3:30pm where a blood clot was found in my left leg. I was admitted into the emergency room at  Hospital and prescribed medication and follow ups from there.  These adverse symptoms developed after I submitted other adverse symptoms to VAERS on April 13, 2021 (Temporary VAERS E-Report Number: 435841).

                                                Around 5:30 pm in the evening following my vaccine I started having chills, headache, nausea, and fever of 101. Chills got worse, whole body was shaking and shivering. Nausea progressed into constant dry heaving. Head was pounding with the worst pain I have ever felt in my life, worse than natural child birth and worse than running marathons. The nausea was so bad and I could feel my fever burning and getting worse. I was about to vomit so got out of bed to go to the toilet to vomit and the whole room started spinning completely out of control. My heart was racing and I could hear it and feel it pounding rapidly through my ears. I couldn?t walk and was so disoriented I crawled to the bathroom to throw up in the toilet. My husband heard me and came and picked me up off the bathroom floor and carried me to our bed. As the night progressed fever got worse, head was in almost unbearable pain, severe body aches over my whole body, heart racing and horrible nausea and dry heaving.  I made it through the night. For two days after I had a headache and fever  and nausea and body aches and couldn?t get out of bed to care for my children. By the third and fourth day I was able to get out of bed at times and still felt fatigue, nausea, headache and body aches. Anytime I would stand up for 10 days after the vaccine it felt like I was rocking on a boat. I am almost at 2 weeks and still feel fatigue and dizziness at times. On April 15th, 9 days after my vaccination I had symptoms of a blood clot in my leg. I went to the Emergency Room and was diagnosed with a superficial blood clot of the leg as well as swelling in the vein. I am thankful to be alive!

                                                Almost immediately after the vaccine at the injection site I  got a real bad hot sensation.  For about 2 days it was swollen and had localized pain for about 9 days.  I was very fatigued.   And I developed a severe headache the next day that was so bad I could barely stand it.  4/11 I  went to the Primary Care and saw a  dr who took bloodwork and prescribed some iron because she said I was anemic.  But for about the first 3 days after the vaccine the headache pain intensity level was at a 10, then it lowered on its on to about a level 3 but was still there for about 3 more days and after about day 6 the headache intensity returned to a level 10 and on day 8 I went back to the dr because nothing would relieve the pain and the pain was so intense I couldnt bare it.  I had an MRI on 4/21 which came back normal with sinus pressure present and finally about 4/23 the headaches finally subsided.   I also notice  the next 2 menustral cycles  after I had severe cramping and my breast got really tender and sore and I bled longer than usual which is abnormal for me and I also noticed I had developed a cyst in my right breast and had a mammogram performed which did show that I had a large cyst in my breast

                                                I received my vaccine at 11:30 AM and had a 102 degree fever by 6 PM. I began to shake very hard and had significant chest pain in my left side by my heart. The shaking and fever subsided by that Sunday night. However, it is now 6/1/21, and I had to go to the doctor today for my chest pain. While the ECG came back clear, the doctor determined that I have Costochondritis. As this is nothing I ever encountered before, I know that is was caused from the COVID vaccine inflammation response during my fever. This is when it was first noticed. It also causes back pain since it is between the breast bone and rib cage.

                                                Patient was not feeling well after vaccine was administered. Laid her down and she passed out briefly for 30 to 60 seconds.  Patient came to and was alert and oriented, able to answers questions (where she was, her name, day/date etc.) Patients breathing was never abnormal and pulse was present the entire time.  Patient was extremely underweight and said she had not eaten or drank much today. Her blood pressure was on the low end but she does not know what it usually is. With patient being so underweight, I was not surprised to see a lower blood pressure reading.  Patient sat up and wanted to drink some OJ and eat a snack as she said she felt like she needed to eat.   Patient sat for 20 to 30 minutes and said she was feeling better and wanted to go home. She had someone who brought her so she was not going to drive. They were going to go get her something to eat. Her friend came in and then pulled up the car for her so she did not have to walk all the way out in the parking lot.

Almost immediately after receiving the vaccination, the patient started looking flushed, and woozy. About a minute after receiving the vaccine she fainted while sitting in the chair, her spouse and myself stabilized her to make sure she didn&#39;t fall. She was drifting in and out of consciousness for about a minute. When she came out of it she seemed confused as to where she was.  She spit up a little bile in our trash can. after a few minutes she stated she was ok so we got her up and to the floor with her feet raised, an ice pack on her neck, some water, and some gummy bears. She rested for about 20 minutes on the floor. She eventually felt good enough to get up so we helped her up and made sure she wasnt feeling dizzy and was feeling ok. She walked to our observation area on her own and waited another 15 minutes and she was doing good so she left the pharmacy.

My arm was sore for the entire evening. I woke up around 2am Saturday morning and became dizzy. I fell to the floor and passed out for a short period of time. When I woke, I was extremely nauseous to the point of nearly vomiting. I had chills and fever. I could hardly move due to weakness - I needed help getting back into bed. When I woke the next morning, I had 100.3 fever, I had a headache and my entire body was sore. My fever went away late Saturday afternoon, but I still felt mildly nauseous. It is Monday and I still have mild nausea and light-headedness. My arm is only slightly sore.

                                                Patient fainted about 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine.  She was in the monitoring area and fell over and hit her head on the ground. I went to her aid and monitored her until the paramedics showed up.  She was unconscious for a 10-15 seconds with her eyes open before regaining consciousness.  IShe was not having breathing problems or other symptoms of anaphylaxis so i did not administer an epi-pen or benadryl to her.  I rolled her on her side in case she became nauseas.  Then the paramedics arrived and attended to her.

                                                After being administered the vaccine at 7:12 am, when the nurse stood me up and started to walk me to the holding area, I became dizzy, my legs got weak, and there was a loud ringing in my ears. I nearly collapsed as I reached the seat in the holding area they were taking me to. I placed one 0.5MG tablet of my prescription Alprazolam in my mouth and waited for the nurse to bring water. They took me via wheelchair from the holding area to a secluded spot behind a curtain. There, I laid on a cot, received cold water, and a nurse talked to me while I recovered. It felt like I was having an anxiety attack, which has never happened to me after getting a shot before. Fitbit heart rate data shows my heart rate at 105 BPM at 7:00 am (going through the admission process, walking around the facility), 83 BPM at 7:10 am, 79 BPM at 7:15 am, 74 BPM at 7:20 am. Between 8:15 am and 1:25 pm, my heart rate remained between 63 and 89 BPM. My arm was sore and my skin hurt (an issue that I have when I feel very stressed). Additional symptoms arose around 1:35 pm. I began going through cycles of chills, sweating and overheating. My heart rate ranged from 127 BPM and 93 BPM for the remainder of the night. I took Tylenol at 7:07 PM to help with my fever.

I woke up to my husband holding my head and yelling my name. I had been seizing and had bitten my tongue. I was very white and nauseous and cold and shaky. They gave me water and a cold pack. The seizure probably only lasted for 5 seconds but it&#39;s hard to say. I felt very fatigued afterwards. I stayed for 10 more min and drank water and then they sent me on my way.

                                                Patient was given the Janssen Covid 19 vaccine on 4/7/21 around 11:55am in her left deltoid. She was accompanied by her husband at the clinic. After the immunization she was seated in the waiting area to be observed for 30 minutes after her vaccine. Approx. 5 mins after the vaccine was given, the patient passed out in the chair and I (the pharmacist) was alerted. The patient came back to when I arrived at her seat and was able to talk and asked for water. Her husband stayed by her side while I went to obtain water and I heard her husband say she passed out again and then regained consciousness. He layed her on the floor while I called 911. An ambulance came and took the patient to the hospital.

Shortness of breath started the next day on Sunday , extreme, far beyond normal asthma or any asthma attack. Went to urgent care on Tuesday- they said it was likely a side effect of j &amp;J and tested me for COVID, kidney disease other things, all came back negtative. Apparently I wasn?t the first person they had seen with shortness of breath. Blood in cough and spit on Wednesday after 2.5 days of  shortness of breath. Dizziness (extreme) throughout and chest pain, sternum hurt, chest tightness. Went to Er. They ran a lot of tests and they too said they had seen others with shortness of breath from j and j. They ruled out many things like pneumonia, a birth control blood clot, any lung diseases with X-rays and blood tests. I was given torkeril to ease the chest pain and tightness which it did. Blood stopped coming up in tissues. Doctor said likely inflammatory reaction to the vaccine in lungs, (I have a piece of paper proving that) and cartilage and sternum., which hurt extremely when he touched it. Blood was likely from burst capillaries from overcompensation from trying to breathe. Recommended I return if more blood came up, which it hasn?t.  Shortness of breath has not subsided. I can?t even hold a phone app without being winded. So email back, don?t call.

My body shook, and it appeared that I had a seizure. Immediately upon waking I started vomiting and having uncontrollable bowel movements for about an hour. I felt confused for about 30 minutes and was unable to speak for a few moments upon waking. When I arrived at the hospital I was still vomiting and having uncontrollable bowel movements. I was given fluids and zofran and sent home without further testing.

For the next week the chest pain persist and got worse. I experienced severe chest pains, struggled with breathing at night, was extremely tired and felt worn out.  I had sharp pains throughtout my body so I went to the ER where a EKG and D-Dimer test was perfomed and was advised it was elevated and I left.  I went to the ER later that day who checked the D-Dimer who advised it was normal and was I  was released from there as well after monitoring.  The next day I began having sharp pains in my stomach and diarreah which prompted me to now go to hospital where a CT scan, X-Ray and EKG was perfomed there also which all results came back normal and advised I reach out to a Cardiovascular Specialist for the Chest pains and I have an appointment scheduled for 4/21/21 for further followup on that

                                                Started experiencing chest pain on March 26th in the evening. I went to my primary care physician that Friday and she performed an EKG that came back normal. She told me if the pain persisted to go to the ER to where they could further evaluate me. A week later I went to the emergency room. They performed a CT scan and EKG and ran blood work everything came back normal. They did state that I had a pulmonary nodule that was benign and to get it rechecked in one year. For aftercare I was Referred to a cardiologist. Upcoming appointment is May 14th 2021.

She was caught by her family members and the pharmacist on duty before she fell. She briefly had a mild seizure and lost consciousness for a minute. When she regained consciousness she stated that she felt nauseous and was seeing double. 911 was called. EMTs arrived and checked her alertness and how she was feeling. The EMTs then took her off in a stretcher to the hospital out of an abundance of caution due to brief loss of consciousness.

                                                On Wednesday May 12th around 615 pm I started having symptoms of a stroke. I was scrambling my words, couldn?t talk right and my left side of my face wouldn?t move when I spoke or smiled. When I smiled my whole smile shifted to the right.  I had my girlfriend call 911 because I knew I was having a stroke. The symptoms lasted about 6 or 7 minutes. By the time the emt got there I was talking fine and my face was back to normal. I went to hospital where a cat scan was done on Wednesday night and came back fine. The doctors decided to admit me because they wanted me to get an MRI in the morning, which I did and came back that I had a minor stroke. The doctors think the stroke had something to with me being on an estrogen birth control as well as some family history but my primary care doctor recommend me report this because I did get the Jansen vaccine and it could have triggered what happened. I was discharged on Friday 5/14/2021 and I know have to take aspirin every day for the rest of my life, plavix for 21 days, and Lipitor until my doctor thinks I can come off.

                                                On May 4th, I fainted shortly after waking up. Light headed and unable to sit upright, stand, or walk. Had a fever. Called out of work.  Headaches, chills, nausea, pain at injection sight, bedridden for most of the day. Around 3/4 in the afternoon I called the doctor&#39;s office (phone kept ringing) so I called the nurse through the insurance company. Nurse advised me to stay home for now but to seek medical care if symptoms persisted for more than 3 days. Symptoms continued but were less severe on Wednesday May 5th causing me to miss another day of school. On Friday May 7th at about 12:50 AM I awoke to severe abdominal pain-the kind the pharmacist had warned me of when getting my vaccine. I could not stand or move. I never take aspirin and yelled for a family member to give me Tylenol. I called the nurse from my insurance company and she asked me a series of questions and advised me to seek immediate medical attention. My family called 911 and an ambulance was sent to the house. They checked my vitals and suggested a family member take me to the ER. My family took me to the Emergency Center. I was wheeled into the ER. ER did test but put &#34;Abdominal Pain, Unknown Cause, (Female) on my paperwork.  I missed another day of work due to my ER visit. Symptoms lessened but persisted for several days.

                                                The day after I experienced extreme muscle and joint pain that lasted about a week. And it started to get better but the following Saturday I got a very terrible headache. And over the course of that week I started bruising very easily and all the veins all over my body were very prominent. The headache wouldn&#39;t go away and I started to have chest pain by that monday. And at that point all the muscle and joint pain came back and it was very very painful. At that point I called my primary care provider and they scheduled me with someone else in the clinic because i was having the chest pain. And they did a test for covid and urged me to go to the emergency room, which i did. After that I went to the emergency room and sat for 5 hours, they did bloodwork to check clotting factor, basic blood panel and also a CT of my head. According to them, everything was normal and they sent me home with a terrible headache. My biggest complaint was the bruising all over my body but no one ever looked at that.

After about thirty minutes, I was able to calm down and my pulse/heart rate dropped down to a level that still seemed elevated, but no longer caused a great deal of concern. This event was followed by nausea for the remainder of the day.

Headache and body aches became intense by 6:20pm on the day I received the vaccine. I took Tylenol Extra strength which helped the body aches and lowered the fever a bit but did little for the headache. Chills started around 10pm accompanied by vomiting and severe diarrhea at 1am. Blood pressure spiked at 142/101 shortly after third vomiting episode. Called family to take me to ER but didn?t end up going because I was able to get vomiting and blood pressure under control by 3am. Figured doctors would just hook me up to an IV of fluids and send me on my way anyway, not something I can afford. No more fever or chills since 4am on 3/14/21. Headache and diarrhea and slight nausea still persisting 29 hours after the shot. Treating symptoms with Tylenol, water, pedialyte, chicken broth, and toast diet. Unable to care for my children, worst I?ve felt in years. Regularly get the flu shot with no side effects.

On that moment I lost consciousness and passed out. In my opinion, I experimented a down on sugar, which had never happened before. My husband was able to catch me and sat me on the floor. A minute after I recovered and my husband gave me fruit (Melon) to raise my blood sugar. On that moment I had lots of nauseas and diarrhea. I was feeling weak and dizzy all night and the next day. Today Wednesday March the 17 I have been feeling much better.

I had her sit down and told her I was giving her an Epinephrine 0.3mg shot.  The shot was given in her left thigh and within a minute her throat cleared. I gave her a bottle of water. She said her heart was racing but it eventually slowed down.  I asked her if she wanted me to call 911, she felt it was not necessary.  Patient sat in our waiting room &amp;  checked in on her every few minutes, her symptoms improved.  Patient was here over 45 minutes.  She wanted to go &amp; felt fine.  I told her to call us or go to the emergency room if any problems arise.

On Sunday, April 11th, I woke up feeling good but then around 12PM I got a heavy nosebleed.

Light headedness increased over the next few minutes and I began to feel faint.  My activity device indicated my heart rate took a sharp drop.  At this point, I thought it best to lie down. I spent the next 5-7 minutes on the floor until I was able to sit up without feeling faint. I waited an additional 15 minutes before leaving.  I felt somewhat shaky, but felt better by the minute.

I got the typical muscle aches, chills, etc. In fact I got every side effect listed plus more. I want to discuss the other side effects. On day 3 I started to develop extreme chest pain and pressure. It is a dull pain as if someone if sitting on my chest that will not go away. I also started to experience sudden bouts of dizziness and vertigo. It will not go away. Today is Day 7 and I spent the night in the emergency room because my chest pains got so strong. However, all the work up came back okay. I also have this strange feeling of electrical shocks running thru my head, those last about .5 seconds and go away, but it is a very weird feeling I have never experienced. I also have a strange desire to constantly burp, when I do my chest pain feels better. If I don&#39;t burp my ears start to feel full and sometimes they ring. Its Day 7 and I still feel SO miserable. Why id no one speaking about these chest pains? I know 5 people who have experienced the same.

                                                After getting the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot at 3:15PM on Saturday (I did pass out at the vaccine clinic approx 2 minutes after receiving the vaccine and had to be escorted to a room to lay down) I developed chills, fever, and aches that night, but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m reporting.  Sunday night, I developed painful red spots on my right inner labia. Monday morning, they had multiplied and darkened. I went in and saw my gynecologist, at 2:00PM. By that time they had worsened again. She could not immediately identify it, but swabbed it to test for herpes. She also prescribed an anti-viral, a rotating dose of OTC 600 ibuprofen and 500mg tylenol, and that I should pick up Orajel for topical numbing.  By Wednesday, the herpes test came back negative (as I expected, having never had herpes), and the spots had grown in size and turned into black and grey ulcers that were shedding with necrosis and were extremely painful. In addition, I was experiencing near exhaustion.  Dr. diagnosed them as Lipshütz ulcers. A severe immune response to the vaccine. In addition to the antiviral, she prescribed a steroid to help quiet the immune response and a few days worth of Hydrocodone to help with the very acute pain.  As of writing this on 4/20/2021, I am still not fully recovered, although Dr. believes it will be cleared up completely in the next couple of days.

Patient sat for 20 additional minutes and reported that tightness may have been elevating. I requested her two friends to take her to the nearest emergency room at Hospital for monitoring.

                                                Patient is a 32-year-old female new patient 5 months post partum &amp; currently breastfeeding, with seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and history of childhood asthma, referred by the emergency department to discuss anaphylaxis like reaction to the Johnson Johnson COVID-19 vaccination on 4/28/21.  She received her vaccine around 2:00 p.m. She began developing itchiness in her palms/soles of feet and scalp that quickly developed into a a welt like rash about 3-1/2 hours after receiving the vaccine while on a walk with her husband; this was shortly followed by facial swelling over her right eye.  They made it home and she got in a cold shower to cool down, became dizzy, started seeing spots and had difficulty breathing. Her husband called EMS and she was hypotensive when they arrived.  She was given 2 doses of epinephrine (0.2 mg each per ED note) and a dose of Benadryl which helped. Shortly after the 2nd dose, she began having difficulty swallowing, maintaining the ability to breathe through her nose. She was given a 3rd dose of epinephrine and transferred to the ED; during transport an IV was started with an epinephrine drip. She was seen at Emergency Department; she was given IV fluids, solu medrol, tryptase level and had a normal EKG.  She was discharged with an epi pen prescription. Tryptase is still pending at the time of her visit. She started a new prenatal vitamin at 11 am 4/28/21. Otherwise, she reports no new foods, medications or topical products. She did eat before going on a walk, pepper jack cheese, wheat thins, and black bean hummus. She is pretty sure she was not stung by a bee prior to onset of symptoms yesterday.   Interestingly she reports recent urticarial episodes that occurred in February of 2021. These occurred when she was visiting her in-laws and occurred in the middle of the night, 2 nights in a row during the middle of her visit.  She has never had hives previously.  She reports no family history of hives or anaphylaxis.  She reports no use of new topical products or medications.

                                                Pt was given the vaccine. Within less than 5 minutes, she said she was feeling light-headed and proceeded to pass out. She fell to the floor, and I went out to assist her. She was able to keep her head from hitting the floor, and I supported her head as she regained consciousness. She tried to sit up but lost consciousness again and appeared to convulse (arms and legs drawn up). She regained consciousness again, and was completely lucid. We called 911 and EMT arrived and continued their usual procedures including checking blood pressure, heart rate, and blood glucose. Her BP was 130/80 laying, and 80/60 sitting. Her pulse was 50. Her blood sugar was 56 before consuming glucose and 71 after. She was given water as well. She declined a ride to the hospital but did have a friend give her a ride home.

                                                Within 17-20 minutes of receiving the vaccine, I felt a burning, hot sensation in my throat. I let paramedics know and sat for about 10-15 more minutes. My mouth and throat became extremely dry and I had a tingly feeling in my feet. I also experienced high anxiety. An ambulance came and proceeded to bring me to the nearest hospital. In the ambulance, I began coughing, which caused tightness in my lungs and moments of needing to cough. My vitals were normal in the ambulance and I was given IV fluids.  I arrived at the hospital around 4:30 pm. When checked by triage about 2 hours later, the nurse reported my vitals were normal, and that I shouldn&#39;t need epinephrine or lab work. She reported that &#34;hopefully a triage doctor would be able to see me soon.&#34; I continued to cough into the evening, and began wheezing from coughing. I waited in the ER waiting room until just before 10pm. Triage could not give  a time estimate of when I could be seen. I needed an inhaler or nebulizer treatment long before.  I left the hospital after the nurse removed the IV port. At this time, the nurse reported my &#34;rash on my chest was gone,&#34; although she did not mention a rash earlier in the evening and I did not notice it (had a jacket on). I did not need to sign or receive discharge paperwork because I was never seen by a doctor. I took Benadryl and gave myself a nebulizer treatment once I got home and all adverse reactions were gone the next morning. I experienced flu-like symptoms the next day.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after injection, I began to experience heart palpitations, heart racing and shortness of breath. This went on for several hours before finally falling asleep. The day following the injection, more and more symptoms began to arise such as muscle soreness, cold/hot sweats, low-grade fever (99.5%), chest pain/pressure, sweating, dizziness/disorientation and a headache. Monday night I experienced the low-grade fever however after going to bed, woke up around 5AM barely unable to stand, very disoriented and upon taking my temperature, I took note that I had a fever of 100.9%. Today, Tuesday May 11th, I am experiencing chest pain/pressure, low-grade fever, headache and am lethargic.

                                                About 2 minutes after receiving the vaccine, while parked, I started getting very light headed, felt dizzy, and my heart starting beating extremely fast, and then slowed down and started beating very very hard, and felt like it was going to pound out of my chest. I then had a warm sensation in my throat and started feeling like it was getting harder to breathe. I rolled down my Window, and looked for someone to wave over for assistance, but there were cars in the way, so I closed my eyes and focused on breathing deep and slowly to see if that would make it any better. After about 5 minutes my heart rate went back to normal, I felt I could breathe normally, and wasn&#39;t so light headed anymore. I should have reported this to someone when they told me I could leave, but I wasn&#39;t sure if it was an actual allergic reaction. Or if it was just a stress reaction. I felt like I should at least report it here, because I was completely fine before the injection, during the injection, and right after, until about 2 minutes after being parked.

I stayed home from work. Over the next few days my fever subsided but my headaches, body aches, nausea and dizziness continued. My headaches worsened and on 4/15 my Dr ordered a brain MRI as well as blood work to be sure of no clotting. The MRI came back normal but I later went to the ER due to worsening severe headache and rapid heart rate. I was later discharged and the Dr told me he believes I am having a more severe pro-longed reaction to the vaccine and that he thought my symptoms would subsided around two weeks post vaccine. I am still currently having sharp headaches and joint pain, I have needed to miss work multiple times due to all of this and not feeling well enough to work or do my normal activities.

I tried relaxing and laying down but the feeling wouldn?t go away. The next morning I woke up with a terrible headache and feeling nauseous. I had diarrhea, and I felt exhausted. I was on the couch most of the day. Later that day, I took my temperature and realized I had a fever. I took some Tylenol and felt fine when I woke up the following morning.  I was approximately 3 months pregnant at the time and f vaccination. My due date is September 17.

                                                Severe menstrual cramping. I have never experienced physical pain like this in my life. My first cycle after the Jansen vaccine, I had an acute cramp attack that lasted about 15 minutes. This was in April. I almost asked my partner to take me to the hospital.   During the second cycle I had since being vaccinated, on the first day I started menstruating, I nearly fainted and was seeing stars while trying to get home. I had taken two Advil and this was not enough to help at all. I took two more shortly afterwards. The blinding pain lasted for 20-30 minutes. I can?t express the severity of this pain. It was unprecedented and terrifying.   The rest of my menstrual cycle is different as well. The first day was extremely heavy aside from being alarmingly painful, and then from the second day on, it was very light.  I also believe that I may have developed seasonal allergies post-vaccine as I have never had them in my life. I am currently struggling with this common discomfort.

                                                2 weeks after the shot I had a scary night where I had severe chest pain. I sat up for a few hours hoping I wasn&#39;t having a heart attack and taking water and tums. I have never had chest pain before or since. I was very concerned and wondered if it was the vaccine. I didn&#39;t have anything unusual to eat or drink. I was happy when it finally resolved that same night.  I also experienced Bell&#39;s Palsy 2 months after the vaccine. (~June 1st) I have never experienced Bell&#39;s Palsy. I am not sure if either of these events were related to the vaccine, but I have no intention of getting a yearly covid or flu vaccine now that I have Bell&#39;s Palsy. It is terrible, and I&#39;m not taking ANY chance of getting this again even if that means I get the flu and covid yearly. I placed my trust in science, and not I am not sure I made the right choice. Although I hope my facial movement and ability to use my lips and face come back, I realize that some never recover.

The infection was moderate in severity that I had to take a week off from work but I did not go to hospital. Then after 3-4 wks post vaccination (the third week of June) I started abdominal pain and diarrhea that was severe enough to cause me dehydration and hypotension. Till now (July 4-2021) I still have bouts of diarrhea and postprandial pain. I lost 6 pounds in the past 3 wks because I am avoiding food. I did go to hospital and I am being managed symptomatically at home.

She vomited into a trash can and had fainted into her chair during the minutes following the husband alerting the pharmacy team she was having a reaction (we were there to witness and aid the patient.)

Patient remarked that she felt completely fine thereafter.

                                                Yesterday I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I was the last appointment, so they observed me for 5 minutes, and I left. After riding in the car for a few minutes, I noticed that I was having a hard time breathing and my throat felt like it was starting to swell. By that time, the clinic was closed, so I went to the emergency room just in case and sat in my car since they didn&#39;t allow people to sit in the waiting room because if covid.  It started becoming increasingly difficult to breathe, and I was feeling more and more swelling of my throat and tongue. I was having a lot of dizziness, nausea, facial flushing, palpitations, and some mild confusion. I then started getting numbness in the bottom half of my face. Over time, the numbness spread, mostly staying on the left side of my body (face, scalp, lower arms and legs, left side on tongue and inside of mouth). I also started getting a prickling burning pain sensation for brief periods of time where I had numbness. I had decided that if my breathing worsened at all, I would go to the er even though I can&#39;t afford it.   After about an hour and a half, my breathing started to feel less constricted and like there was less resistance. The swelling in my throat was mostly in the upper throat where I had difficulty swallowing but not as much difficulty breathing. The numbness continued to get worse and was sometimes disappearing and reappearing in the same spot.  At 9:30 pm we went to go get some benadryl. I continued feeling less and less swelling and having an easier time breathing. At that point, I went home. Once I was home, my breathing continued to improve and the numbness started to dissipate.  In the middle of the night, I started itching and getting widespread hives and getting a sharp burning pricking pain that would last a few seconds in different areas. The numbness also started coming back mostly in my face. I continued to have difficulty swallowing.  I am feeling much better today. I still feel some slight swelling in my throat when I swallow, but my breathing is fine. I&#39;m still itchy and occasionally breaking out in hives. Im having mild lower facial numbness. I&#39;m also starting to get the normal side effects of fever, headache, arm soreness, and body aches. I&#39;m taking benadryl every 4 hours.

                                                About a minute after I had the injection, my arm started hurting and it felt like hot water was coursing through my veins. I got an immediate headache that progressed into light headedness, my vision got blurry and I saw colors and then I started to lose my hearing, it felt like there was cotton in my ears. The nurses said I went pale and they called it a panic attack, but it was unlike any panic attack I have ever had in my life. I?ve had my TDAP updated a few years ago and got a flu shot and did not feel anything like this. I was rolled out of the room on a wheel chair because I was too dizzy to walk and then threw up several times into a bag and peed myself. It took about 20 minutes before I felt normal again.   The following day my arm felt numb and incredibly sore, I couldn?t raise it that far up without excruciating pain. I felt weak, fatigued and dizzy and was unable to use the bathroom. I had fever sweats and chills on and off. I was not able to sleep well, but I think that?s because of the pain in my arm.

She did have some of the other usual side effects of the vaccine - chills, mild headache, tired. The rapid heart rate has not subsided or worsened. She doesn&#39;t have a primary care doctor.  The pharmacist recommended she call 911, which is recommended, just in case it is an allergic reaction and it can be treated quickly.

When I woke up in the morning I had a headache, muscle aches, slight difficulty breathing with chest heaviness, and fatigue.

By March 9 all side effects had resolved.

                                                Approximately 5 days after vaccination I started experiencing VERY strong heart palpitations, so much so I am able to see my chest move while they&#39;re happening and have captured it on my cell phone. The only other time I have experienced heart palpitations was while pregnant, I am not currently pregnant.   So far, the palpitations have continued with less severity approximately two weeks from onset. I have contacted my doctor and he has advised if they do not resolve by the end of this week/this weekend, I should contact him and we will look into an EKG and/or holter monitor.   Often while having the palpitations I am completely at rest. They have occurred randomly throughout the day and evening. They have not woken me during the night if they have happened while I sleep. I wear a smart watch daily and my heart rate appears to be normal. My heart does not race during the palpitations. There is no pain or discomfort felt while it happens. I have been able to work out every couple of days without feeling like something is wrong.

These symptoms continued throughout the night. The next day I had a low-grade fever that responded to Tylenol, and generally felt fatigued and achy. The next night I had some chills and shaking (though not as bad). The following day I had a headache and fatigue but no fever.

                                                Approximately 5 hours after I received the vaccine, I started to feel extremely fatigued and experienced some muscle aches. I took an Aleve and laid down for an hour long nap. At approximately 7:00pm, I woke up with more extreme muscle pain. By 8:00pm, my muscles were so tight and painful that it hurt to move, lay still, or go to the bathroom. It felt as though all of the muscles in the back of my body (from my back to my butt and legs) were spasming, Over the next few hours, my temperature rose to 102.7 and my heart rate spiked to 140-150 bpm. I also experienced chills and a headache. We sought the advice of a 24-hour nurse, who let us know these symptoms were likely normal side effects. I went to bed around 12:00am, and my temperature had dropped to 99.9 around 3:00am when I woke up to check it.  My heart rate eventually dropped below 100 bpm around 8:00am. I woke up around 10:00am on Saturday feeling much better than the day before. My temperature was around 99.1 when I woke up, and my symptoms included mild muscle aches, a moderate headache, and moderate fatigue. I continued to feel better throughout the day, with the headache gradually subsiding and a minor sore throat toward the end of the day. On Sunday, I felt back to normal, other than experiencing some mild-moderate fatigue.

                                                Started with chills pretty shortly after the vaccine was injected.  After about 6 hours I could tell I was not feeling great.  My husband said I looked very pale and out of it all of the sudden.  I became extremely tired and disoriented.  I don?t remember driving myself home that evening after picking up my kids from dance.  By the time I was home it was now around 8 pm.  I was so cold my entire body was trembling.  I kept taking steaming hot showers but I couldn?t feel it, I was still freezing and shaking.  I was very weak and started having extremely horrible body aches and pains.  Specifically my legs were hurting the worst, I remember my hip joints felt like they?d buckle underneath me.  I got a headache that was unbearable.  It felt worse than a migraine.  It hurt to move my head or use my eyes at all.  I went to bed and was under several blankets and a heating pad while also running a space heater right next to me.  I still could not get warm at all.  I hallucinated that I could see each ache and pain on my body and watched them move through me.  By 4 am I was now hysterical and crying.  I was in so much unbearable pain and so scared.  I had to call off of work for this day.  I was so out of it I called my daughter off of school but also called for my mom to come get her and take her to school.  I kept my youngest home with me.  My head was still the absolute worst headache I have ever felt in my life.  I couldn?t open my eyes and it hurt to move at all.  I had to call a friend to come pick up my youngest daughter because I was unable to take care of her, I could barely stay awake and alert.  I tried another hot shower and everything still felt cold.  I was now nauseous from the head pain.  Around noon on this day I finally had the strength to drink some water and was able to take Tylenol.  I laid on the couch for hours still shivering and in unbearable pain.  I was still very scared that I was having such a bad reaction that I would die.  I called my husband to come home from work and be with me because I was scared.  I took more Tylenol a couple hours after the first dose.  Around 6 pm I started to feel better.  I was able to eat again that evening.  I had a headache though for about 3 weeks after that gradually weaned away.

                                                Tachycardia.  I had the expected side effects of headache, chills, body aches, fatigue and fever (102.6 F) but began to experience symptoms of pounding/racing heart that worsened through the evening. By 10:00 pm my heart rate was bouncing around between 130 bpm and 155 bpm, and I was beginning to have pain in my lower legs/ankles.  Was told by a on call nurse for my clinic to go to the ER. I was in the ER for about 5 hours, roomed the whole time as they worked to get my heart rate down and checked to make sure I didn&#39;t have a blood clot. They performed an EKG and CT Scan of my chest, both were fine. I was eventually allowed to leave after 4 am on 4/10/21 after my heart rate got into the high 90&#39;s with only small spikes into the 110&#39;s with slight movement and once my fever had broken.

Then my head starting hurting and I felt extremely hot. My legs and chest were pink and hot to the touch. Very high fever, head pain , nausea and heart palpitations. I took Tylenol which helped with the fever. The next day I had some minor aches and dizziness. Later the same day, I had  sharp aches/pains down my back and an upset stomach. That night I had a fever again but not as high. Today, two days later, I feel back to normal with the occasional ache or cramp.

                                                The day after receiving the vaccine, I experienced common side effects of fever, chills, body aches, and nausea, which lasted for 24 hours, and then I felt better. Then, 3 days after receiving the vaccine, I suddenly began to have extreme stomach pain, so bad that I could barely walk or stand up straight. My chest felt tight and I had shortness of breath. I thought about going to the ER, but called my GI specialist instead as I thought it could be related to the Xifaxan I was taking, but the office was already closed. The GI office called the following Monday and said the Xifaxan should not cause extreme stomach pain and to go to the ER if it persists, but by this time I was feeling much better. The severe pain lasted two days in total.

                                                I was 9 months pregnant at the time of the vaccination. My due date was April 3, 2021. The actual date of delivery was March 20, 2021 by C-section. I gave birth to a son weighing 8 lbs 6 oz. I had no complications during this pregnancy. I left the hospital on March 22nd. On March 25, I was experiencing shortness of breath and a low pulse (35 bpm; my usual pulse is in the 50s-60s). My OBGYN told me to go to the emergency room, where they did a CT scan. The CT scan showed a small pulmonary embolism. I was in the hospital until March 27th, where I was treated with Heparin and then was released with Lovenox injections. I am currently on the Lovenox. After seeing the pulmonologist for a follow-up appointment, he advised me that I would be able to stop the injections after 3 months.

                                                I was very ill on Friday night after receiving the vaccination. Flu-like symptoms, high fever, shortness of breath, pain in my abdomen, horrible headache, nausea, dizziness, loss of consciousness and leg pain (both legs). The flu-like symptoms passed on Saturday, but by Tuesday, April 13 I was continuing to have a terrible headache, abdominal pain and leg pain. I saw my primary doctor on the 13th and was sent over to the hospital for an ultrasound of my leg. No clots were found and I was told to continue trying to recover at home unless it got worse. I was seen at the emergency room on April 14th for abdominal pain, leg pain, dizziness and headache. The nurse told me I was probably hysterical over the vaccination being pulled, and I told him this was not the case. They performed CT (without contrast) on my abdomen and head, then released me with instructions to return if I was worse. By the 16th I was unable to walk as my left side was completely numb. I went back to the ER. I had a CT of my abdomen and head with and without contrast. I had a lumbar puncture and several labs. I was given IV antibiotics for some infection they found in my urine. I was given fluids and pain meds, and my BP was shooting up to 145/94 (which is very high for me), when standing. My vision was blurry and I was unable to remember much of the last week. I was admitted from the 16th through the 20th and had an MRV, 2 MRIs, more lab work and medicine for my headache. I was released on the 20th and the headache was unbearable and I was still numb on my left side, going back to my doctor on the 22nd. He suggested the ER, and the ER admitted me back to the stroke unit. I was released on the 22nd with a diagnosis of a hemiplegic migraine that could cause stroke-like symptoms (ZERO history of headaches previously). I was sent home with a walker and home health services. PT visited on April 30th and ordered two visits per week for the next month. I am unable to walk without a walker. I cannot shower or use the stairs without assistance. My memory is still foggy. I am unable to concentrate for long. I often stutter and can&#39;t remember basic words. I have also stopped and forgotten where I am at a given moment. I am on Depakote nightly for the headaches, and they have lessened slightly, but when they flare up it is debilitating and I often vomit. I have instructions to follow up with my primary tomorrow morning and see what the next steps are.

She stated that she had just gone on a bike ride and hadn&#39;t eaten anything all day before she received her vaccination, which is what she thought was the cause of her fainting..  She waited in the area for at least 20 minutes before she said she felt ok to leave.  She was eating a protein bar while waiting, to help with the low blood sugar.

                                                Patient experienced sudden dizziness and nausea within 5 minutes of receiving Janssen COVID-19 immunization. Gave her water, crackers and cold/wet rags for her forehead as she felt hot. Took her temperature, returned normal. Gave her a trash can to keep near. Kept an eye on the patient and realized she was getting red in the face and more dizzy than she had been. Went out and stood next to patient, with her mom on her other side. Began to experience light sensitivity, feeling like the room was spinning. Patient almost fell out of the chair while sitting still. Mom used a personal pulse oximeter on patient, all results normal. Asked the patient about other symptoms, such as chest/abdominal/leg pain, headache, shortness of breath. Patient reported a headache, dizziness, nausea and leg numbness roughly 30 minutes following the vaccine. I recommended going to the ER, mom believed it would pass with time, but insisted she never responds this way to immunizations. Patient began to experience stabbing chest and abdominal pain around 45 minutes. Patient&#39;s mom was still hesitant to take her to the ER immediately on her own and asked us to call her PCP. He wanted the patient to go to the ER. Patient believed she would fall if she stood, offered to get a motorized cart, wheelchair or call an ambulance to transport her. Both patient and mom requested the ambulance. Asked a technician to check patient medications and allergies for EMTs, retook the patient&#39;s temperature which was normal again. Stayed with patient until EMTs arrived, reported all symptoms patient was experiencing.

I gave the vaccine and pt said she was okay. a couple minutes later she said she was feeling very warm and asked for something to fan herself with. I asked another pharmacist is get her a cold compress. When she came back with it and went to give it to the patient she fainted and slumped in her chair; she did not fall out of the chair. she was unconscious for less than 30 seconds and lost bladder control. I continued to rub her wrists and neck with the cold paper towel and she regained consciousness and said she was okay. we observed her for at least 20 minutes more and then she left. she said she did not require any further medical attention.

                                                I received my Janssen vaccine on 3/31/21.  On 4/29/21, I had a virtual appointment with a naturopath about a completely separate health issue (mold illness), and she asked me to check my blood pressure.  I checked my blood pressure using my father in law&#39;s at home cuff, and it was 149/99.  I continued to check over several days and had persistently elevated readings, ranging from 122-165/93-107.  My last known normal BP reading was in February of 2021 and was 110/70, which is my typical BP.  I had not checked my BP at any time between February and April because I had no reason to believe it would be elevated.  On 5/2/21, I had a reading of 165/107, which prompted me to go to the ER.  At the ER in triage, my BP was 188/144.  EKG was normal and troponin I was normal.  I was monitored for a few hours with BP around 155/100, and after a dose of Nadolol, my BP came down to 122/79.  I also had chest pain/tightness during this experience, which may have been due to anxiety.  My BP has continued to be persistently elevated (now coupled with anxiety about what is going on, which doesn&#39;t seem to be helping the numbers!), and I had to return to the ER on 5/5/21 after getting an at home reading of 180/122 (this was about 1 hour after taking a dose of Nifedipine).  At the ER triage, my BP had come down to 140/109, so they sent me home.  My BP has now remained elevated at around 135-140/95-100, while taking 30mg Nifedipine ER daily.

I had extremely bad headaches that went away for 2 days then started up again extremely bad the Monday (4/12/21) after my vaccine.   Visited my primary care doctor on Wednesday (4/14) as they wouldnt go away. advised to take motrin.  On friday (4/17) they still had not gone away and went to Urgent care due to fear since the vaccine had been pulled for preventative measures. they did blood work and advised to take some decongestants as the weather had been strange (Snow and 80degrees in the same week) that helped.

I was able to catch her before she fell to the floor. She was laid down on her back and her legs were lifted (911 called). Her BP was 92/63 and PR was 65. She was conscious and alert this entire time. When checked again in 5 minutes, BP was 112/75. When fire rescue arrived, she was alert. She reported not hitting her head. Waited another 20 minutes, then left.

                                                EMT Bustamante noted the client was splashing water on her face and hugging her caretaker in the observation area. EMT Bustamante approached the client and asked how she was feeling. The client reported anxiety to EMT Bustamante at 1:34PM. EMT Bustamante escorted the client and her caretaker outside the building and she was seated on a bench. Vitals obtained at 1:34 PM were as follows: BP 130/90, HR 110, and O2 99%. 2 RN&#39;s responded at 1:40PM. The client at that time stated she was having &#34;anxiety.&#34; 2 RN&#39;s left the scene. At 1:49 PM the client stated she &#34;couldn&#39;t breathe.&#34; RN responded and provided an emesis bag to the client. The client started using the emesis bag to breathe into. RN counted with the client to slow her breathing down. At 1:50PM the client stated she was &#34;starting to feel better.&#34; RN played a 3 minute meditation for the client. At 1:53 PM the client was provided an ice pack on the back of her neck. Vitals obtained at 1:55PM were as follows BP138/82, HR 115, and O2 99%. The client noted frustration about her anxiety and increased heart rate. The client also noted &#34;weakness&#34; in her right arm. At 2:03PM the client received emotional support from her caretaker via a hug. At 2:10 the client stated she was &#34;feeling better and almost ready to leave.&#34; The client took 2 puffs of her Albuterol inhaler around 2:12. The client stated she uses the inhaler PRN for a history of asthma. The client also reports a history of anxiety which is not controlled with medication. At 2:14PM vitals obtained were as follows: BP 128/84, HR 127, and O2 99%. The client subsequently stood up and stood underneath a tree in the shade. The client received another emotional support hug, was provided a new ice pack, and continued to splash water on her face. RN offered to call EMS services, and the client declined. RN educated the client and her caretaker of s/s of anaphylaxis, when to seek EMS, and to follow up with PCP regarding anxiety symptoms, and V-safe. The client voiced understanding of this. RN escorted the client out of the vaccination site. The client ambulated unassisted with a steady gait. RN visualized the client entering the vehicle to be driven home by her caretaker at 2:27 PM.

                                                About a week or two after receiving the vaccine, my period started getting heavier than usual. The next period was even heavier. My most recent period started on June 19th and got extremely heavy (1 pad per hour, heavy clotting) in the past two of three weeks. I had my Mirena IUD removed on June 27th, because I thought it was affecting my period. My period slowed for the 3 days it was out, then started heavy again after starting the mini pill. I was bleeding so heavy that I was dehydrated and hospitalized on July 9th. I was drinking a lot of water that day, but eventually threw up and felt like I was going to pass out. I had tingly and cold fingers and toes.  After stopping the mini pill that night, my period has slowed but not stopped.

                                                Had all side effects within 24 hours of vaccine- went to bed with a headache and chills, had body aches and slight nausea the next day. Then it all went away aside from some lingering arm pain.  A few days after the shot I had tingling and numbness in all 4 limbs. I also had random sharp pains in my right leg. I woke up Friday morning and my right arm felt like ice cold water was dripping down (but wasn?t). My husband took my blood pressure and it was really high and my chest felt tight. Given that the vaccine was just paused for blood clots we went to the ER. They ran labs and said I didn?t have any clots.  Here is the timeline of what happened after:  Saturday &amp; Sunday &amp; Monday: Felt normal again  Tuesday: Felt short of breath  Tingles started to come back  Wednesday: Leg and arm numbness   Thursday thru the next few days were the worst:  Thursday: Random sharp pains, back, thigh, ab  Right calf felt a bit swollen and more sensitive  Tingling on back of head Tingling in leg and arm  High anxiety pain in chest  No appetite High blood pressure   Friday: Muscle twitching in thigh, sides and random places  Random tightness/sharp pain in thigh  Blood pressure and heart rate went back to normal  High anxiety pain in chest before bed  Didn?t sleep well keep panicking awake (not normal) No appetite   Saturday: Right calf slightly swollen after walking around  Still had muscle twitches and it?s always in the same spot in my thigh   Did a teledoc appt which was totally unhelpful  High anxiety pain in chest- felt like I was going to pass out at one point and we took my blood pressure in that moment and it was high ?happened after dinner No appetite  Note: anxiety is not something I?ve ever had   Sunday: Swelling in leg returned Sharp pains randomly A little heavy to breath at times  Tension in my head ? felt cold After I ate dinner chest heaviness returned Sensory overload- watching tv couldn?t do. Sound of humidifier plus tv  gave me major anxiety. Turned humidifier off and it  instantly got better  No appetite   Next few days Leg feels numb tingly in morning  Slightly tingling in my right hand Light headache  Some random twitches and sharp pains in thigh still  The next month all seemed fine. It wasn?t until I got a small cold that the tingling flared up again. Right leg continues to be a problem-tingling and numbness comes and goes daily. I?ve also had a few episodes of chest tightness out of the blue.  Last night I woke up to find my right arm also tingly and numb.

                                                Patient lost consciousness for approximately 30 seconds immediately after receiving the vaccination. Her eyes and head rolled back, and there was a small amount of foam coming from the mouth. The patient did not enter anaphylaxis or stop breathing at any point. A pharmacy technician called 911 while the pharmacist moved the patient to the ground to lay down and monitor for further reaction. The patient was provided with food and water. EMS arrived on the scene approximately 10 minutes later. They took the patient&#39;s pulse and blood pressure, which was slightly low (100/58 - I believe). The paramedics determined that the patient experienced syncope and there was no need for further evaluation at the facility. The patient remained in the pharmacy for about an hour until she felt strong enough to go home.

Mom brought patient to me for assessment. When patient presented to me, patient was alert and vitals were normal. I asked patient to remain seated for 15 more minutes of observation.  Mom did say patient exhibited this behavior once before at the eye doctor.  I informed mom to please check with patients doctor for follow up. Patient exhibited some mental disability and thats is why the mother is involved. I dont believe patient is capable of taking care of herself.

                                                After the shot was administered the store had me wait in case there was a reaction. While I was sitting down, waiting for about 15 minutes I felt dizzy and fainted. My head hit the floor. The store called the paramedics. I woke up sweating and the paramedics arrived. The paramedics took my bloodpressure and reported it at 84 over 50. They waited while I felt ready to stand up. After a 3 to 4 minutes I felt I could stand up and they took me outside. Once outside they took my blood pressure again and it was at 110/80. I opted to go home instead of the hospital and I feel tired.

                                                I received the vaccination 4/2/21 at 11am and at about 6pm the same day - I felt a sudden flush and felt like I was going to faint in the middle of Grocery store. Got very clammy and sweaty and weak - immediately left the store and started projectile vomiting outside the store and all night the first night. Had extremely joint/bone pain throughout my entire body for 4 days straight in bed, very weak, chills and night sweats, day 2 I had a little energy and drove about an hour and immediately started vomiting again  for day 2-day 5. Day 5 I woke up with swollen eye lids and hands and thought it was an allergic reaction to something in my house so took benedryl, but didn?t help. The swelling went down on day 6. I?ve had no energy and very foggy brain and been very down. My chest has felt like an anxiety attack 24/7 all week. I am on day 10 since the vaccination and my chest pain has increased. I still have foggy brain and been very out of it and weak still. I vomited day 1-day 5. Really bad pain in my hips and arm where I received the shot.

It was not an option so I wrote it in.  2 weeks after the shot I still have mild pain when breathing in and feel like I am winded more easily to the point that even before the vaccine was in the news I made an appointment with my doctor. He did EKG and D Dimer tests. Both came back normal but I still don?t feel myself.

After administration of the vaccine she appeared relieved afterwards and recieved a card with a note to wait for 15 minutes for any reactions. Her mother escorted her to her car, 10 minutes later, her mother came in saying &#34;she&#39;s having a seizure!&#34; We had a certified nurse that was administering the shots that went out to check on her and we had a technician call 911. Patient appeared disoriented in the car and clammy to touch. We checked her blood pressure, and the nurse reported it was a little low. After paramedics arrived was being treated as a vaso-vagal response and she was transported to the nearby hospital.

                                                Approximately 5 hours after the vaccine I developed a very bad headache followed by chills, sweats, congestion, chest pain, body pain, muscle pain, fatigue and fever. The muscle pain and weakness was so bad I would loose balance when walking. I then started to menstruate clots, not my normal cycle timing,  which lasted about 2 days. The clots subsided but I am still bleeding today. I was in bed for 4 days with severe immune response symptoms. After those symptoms subsided the fatigue was so extreme it was hard to function.

                                                I was given the vaccine at 11:10am and by 5:30pm I was beginning to feel tired and unwell. At 6:45 I had a fever, body aches, pain in my arm, headache, and chest pain. These symptoms continued for three days and my fever reached 102.7.  After three days the fever and body aches subsided but the fatigue and chest pain continued. The chest pain has continued with increased heart rate during small bursts of activity. I called the clinic that administered my shot on April 9th and was told chest pain was normal up to 10 days and if it continued to be a problem to go to the ER. After 11 days of chest pain I went to the ER on April 13th and they did an EKG, CT with contrast, and blood work. They concluded I was fine. I was told it could be esophagitis so to take 2 15mg Prevacid a day which I have done with no relief. I was also informed it could be muscle related so I have iced, taken anti-inflammatory medication, and have not exerted myself.  It is now April 19th and I am still experiencing chest pain and racing heart rate with minimal exertion.

Scheduled appointment.   4/14/21 cont. Seen in office by PA for: 1. Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses. - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT; Future   2. Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3. Family history of DVT - see #1 4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.  (Per provider result notes.)  4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.  Following the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.     She has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.  No abdominal pain.  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.   Patient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.  Advised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.    4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine. An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE. She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days. She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot. She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago. The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.   Today, patient presents states he feels &#34;a lot better&#34;. Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved. She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter; she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this. She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.    She was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75. Today her blood pressure is 122/78.   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved; she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds. She denies pain or swelling of the arm. She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone. She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla. She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.    Her mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved. She denies worsening or severe headache; denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.   Phone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr. After review of patient&#39;s history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily. They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week. They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.   I did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice. They had just left this morning for another state by car. I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not. She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended.

                                                I had a fast heart rate (approx 120 beats per minute while resting). I called my consulting nurse who advised me to go into Urgent Care. I went to Urgent Care. They gave me an EKG, which showed my increased heart rate, but nothing abnormal. I was given Tylenol to see if that decreased my heart rate, but it didn&#39;t. I was told to drink lots of water to see if dehydration might be why my heart rate was increased. The Urgent Care doctor consulted with an OB Doctor and concluded that my increased heart rate was due to my body&#39;s response to the vaccine in connection with the pregnancy.   At the time of the adverse event, I was 23 weeks pregnant. My estimated date of delivery is July 13, 2021. This current pregnancy is my 3rd. My second pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. During my first pregnancy, I developed Gestational Diabetes and Preeclampsia. I needed insulin to manage the Gestational Diabetes and I was induced at 37 weeks pregnant because of the Preeclampsia. My daughter had to be in the NICU after birth for 5 days due to low oxygen, low blood sugar, low muscle tone, dusky color, and no cry.

                                                patient admitted 4/23 for a multitude of symptoms and signs suggestive of a multisystem autoimmune inflammatory disorder of unclear etiology. Her past medical history is relevant for mild intermittent asthma, history of recurrent idiopathic urticaria, history of migraine headaches, hypothyroidism on supplemental levothyroxine, history of bipolar affective disorder on antipsychotropic medications (lamotrigine) and ADHD on stimulant medication (Focalin).  Notably, the patient received a Johnson and Johnson COVID19 vaccine on 4/10. She reports current symptom onset on 4/17. Symptoms include pleuritic type chest pain, myalgias, arthralgias, diffuse interstitial edema, urticaria and objectively evidence of diffuse inflammation manifested by rising leukocytosis 16,000, CRP 9.3 from 5.7 just days ago, ESR 71 from 34 just several days ago, and new acute hepatitis. Pt admitted to the hospital and hospitalist states &#34;Unclear etiology definitively but the clinical features all developed approximately 1 week after administration of the Janssen/Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 adenovirus vaccine which raises suspicion for this vaccine setting off the disease process&#34; and &#34;Strongly recommend consideration for reporting of possible adverse reaction to the Johnson Johnson vaccine&#34;.

                                                During my menstrual cycle I usually have no symptoms other than tender breasts. So these symptoms were very unusual. Leg pains, pain and pressure in pelvis, clitoral pain, pain around vaginal opening, stinging like acid during urination that sent a shock through my entire body, uncontrollable bladder, nausea, large blood clots, lower stomach pain, flank pain, hot/cold chills, if I touch my belly button the pain radiated to my vagina, ovaries hurt, cervix pain, dryness, unable to get comfortable, crawling out of my skin, and constant urge to urinate, depression.  I landed myself in the ER where they told me to take Tylenol and Motrin and sent me on my way. These medications were not able to control the amount of pain I was in. I have now reached out to a couple specialists.

Patient received antipyretics and Benadryl and began to feel better. On re-exam patient was still hot to the touch and tachycardic. Patient was diagnosed with a vigorous immune response to the vaccination.

                                                Three days the vaccine I got very short of breath with confusion, dizziness and light headed and disoriented.  I felt like there was pressure in my chest and I had some brain fog. I felt like I had water in my lungs. My right arm bicep was contracting and twitching. I had Vertigo which made it very hard to sit down without feeling off balance. I was unable to drive. I tried to hope it would pass but I went to the ER on 4/14/2021. The dizziness was getting worse after five days and the pressure on my chest was unbearable. I was advised to drink some water and take Tylenol.  My blood pressure was lower than normal. I finally felt better on 4/21/2021. I could finally get out of bed and not feel like I was going to fall down. I could not drive for about two and a half weeks. I still feel a little out of breath and my brain is a little foggy but it has gotten a little better.

The patient&#39;s weight and height were not reported. The patient medical history included being 4 months post-partum. The patient had no drug, food or other product allergies, and had no chronic or long-standing conditions. The patient received COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S (suspension for injection, route of administration and batch number not reported), dose was not reported, administered on 23-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported. From an unspecified date, the patient had 2 weeks of headaches and blurry vision, 2 to 3 days of neck stiffness and nausea with 1 episode of vomiting and had been transferred to the current hospital from another. On 04-APR-2021 (12 days post-vaccination), the patient was diagnosed with dural venous sinus thrombosis (DVST), transverse/sigmoid (cerebral venous) sinus thrombus (CVST) with associated intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the right temporal lobe as well as thrombosis of the right internal jugular vein (thrombus). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) impressions showed there was a re-demonstrated of intraparenchymal hematoma in the right posterior temporal lobe measuring approximately 6.2 x 3.6 cm in maximal axial dimensions. There was surrounding edema and associated mass effect with effacement of the right temporal horn and right-to-left midline shift measuring 5 mm. There was medialization of the right uncus without transtentorial herniation. The basal cisterns were otherwise patent. There was dural thickening and hyperenhancement overlying the hemorrhage. There was prominent cortical veins along the right frontal temporoparietal convexity consistent with venous congestion. There was also a small are of vasogenic edema in the right anterior temporal lobe separate from the hematoma. There was a right mastoid effusion, but normal orbitals and the calvarium and skull base were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) results revealed non-opacification of the torcula, right transverse sinus, right sigmoid sinus and upper internal jugular vein compatible with occlusive thrombosis. A small amount of thrombus also extended into the left transverse sinus. The superior sagittal sinus, remainder of the left transverse sinus, left sigmoid sinus, left upper internal jugular vein, straight sinus, vein of Galen and bilateral internal cerebral veins demonstrated normal contrast opacification. The patient&#39;s platelet count was 126 upon admission (normal range [NR] not provided), with other workup laboratory test results reported as pending. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S was not applicable. The outcome of the right internal jugular thrombus, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, DVST, CVST, headache, blurry vision, neck stiffness, nausea and vomiting was reported as unknown. This report was serious (caused/prolonged hospitalization and other medically important condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This case concerns a 34-year-old white female who experienced cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), dural venous sinus thrombosis, right internal jugular vein thrombosis, and cerebral hemorrhage 12 days after receiving covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s for prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The patient was noted to be 4 months post-partum. She presented for medical assistance with a 2-week history of headaches, blurry vision, and neck stiffness for 2 to 3 days as well as nausea with 1 episode of vomiting. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large hematoma in the right posterior temporal lobe with surrounding edema and associated mass effect resulting in effacement of the right temporal horn and right-to-left midline shift measuring 5 mm and occlusive thrombus within the torcula, right transverse sinus, right sigmoid sinus, and upper internal jugular vein.  A small amount of thrombus extended into the medial aspect of the left transverse sinus. The platelet count on admission was 126,000. Although the post-partum status of the patient may have contributed, based on evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS, per definition from Brighton Collaboration) and considering the low platelet count and temporal relationship to vaccination, we consider the events to have a plausible relationship with vaccination.

Heartburn faded (did try taking Tums, with little effect), changed back to mainly stomach pain.  Stomach pain daily 4/19 - 4/29, mainly occurring (1) before &amp; after breakfast, (2) late afternoon, (3) evening. Began taking Prilosec (omeprazole) on 4/30; stomach pain similar to previously described 4/30 - 5/1. Symptoms became more intense, heartburn and heart pain on 5/2, stomach pain 5/3, heartburn and heart pain 5/4. Stopped Prilosec 5/5, symptoms receded to mild heartburn and stomach pain 5/5 - 5/6.  Currently deciding next steps for treatment. Stomach pain can be soreness, occasional twinges, all located just below left ribcage.  Heartburn upper left, feels warm but also sore (kind of like someone punched me there).

                                                Patient admitted to acute care hospital approximately 7 weeks after receiving Janssen vaccine with thrombocytopenia.  Platelet count 4000 at PCP and patient advised to present to the ED.  On admission 5/5/21, repeat platelet count 8000.  Emergent CT completed which ruled out cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.  PT, INR, fibrinogen and d-dimer were normal.  Hematology felt that it was most consistent with immune thrombocytopenia and unknown if any relation to her COVID vaccination.

Her head fell backwards and husband saw this-he pushed her head forward and yelled for help.  When I got to the pt she was unconcious and unresponsive.  I tried to revive pt and she initially did not respond. We called 911.  I lifted her head and she started to gurgle and seemed like she was going to throw up.  She then came to.  When EMT arrived they checked vitals and blood sugar.  All was fine.  Pt refused any other help.  I spoke with pt today and she is fine

                                                Around 1:30pm on Tuesday April 6th, I was sitting at my desk in my home office, working. I began experiencing moderate chest pain and shortness of breath. These symptoms continued to worsen for the next hour. I had difficulty breathing, and taking a full breath was painful enough to prevent me from doing so. I drove myself to the ER. While waiting in the ER, I began experiencing chills, severe joint pain, and moderate pain generally throughout my body beginning around 4:00pm, which I advised ER staff. While being examined by the ER doctor around 7pm, there was some tenderness noted in my right upper quadrant. My blood pressure was extremely high (205/130) and I developed an intense headache. I was admitted overnight and discharged the afternoon of April 7th. While the chills and pain improved on April 7th, my chest pain and shortness of breath continued for another week or so. The night of April 7th at home, I woke up several times with difficulty breathing and ended up sleeping fitfully while propped up at a 45 degree angle so I could at least breathe mostly normally. The chest pain and difficulty breathing slowly improved over about 10 days until I was no longer experiencing symptoms.

On the 3rd and 4th day, I went to see my PCP and went for a  routine check up where I was found to have a low heart rate. My heart rate had dropped to 34. I went to the ER due to my low heart rate and not because of the J&amp;J vaccine. Also due to my anorexia condition, I could not sleep, drink fluids and also had diarrhea.  To this day I still have low heart rate.

Customers near the waiting area  assisted her while alerting the pharmacist. She was regaining consciousness as I got to her side. Assisted her to chair, gave Gatorade and candy then later cold bottle of water. Patient stated she was having waves of &#34;hot flashes and nausea&#34; which remained constant over the next 30-45 minutes. She called her husband to drive her home.  She left with him at approx. 7:15 pm.

                                                I was vaccinated at 36.5 weeks pregnant.  The following morning, I was nauseated, had muscle aches, and chills.  I went to the OB/GYN for a scheduled check up and my blood pressure was approximately 160/90.  It had been 118/76 the night before at the pharmacy and had been around 112/72 my entire pregnancy.  I got home and had a fever of 100.2F and took a nap due to pure exhaustion.  My BP remained elevated (130s/80s) for the following 3 days.  I then had to go back to the OB for a BP check 3 days later where it was then 175/95.  I was forced to be induced the following day due to my high blood pressures.  Baby was born 24 hours after the start of induction and weighed 6lbs 9oz (37 weeks, 2 days) and is healthy.  My blood pressure remained elevated (140s/80-90s) for weeks following vaccination.  It took approximately 4 weeks for blood pressure to return to my normal readings post vaccination.

Pharmacist was resting arm on patient shoulder to stop potential fall, changed position to front of patient, then assisted to the floor (~2:15-2:19pm).  Patient continued drinking and completed ~4oz of water while changing position from back to right side.  Rolled up smocks were under her head and neck for comfort.  Pharmacist and supervisor continued to ask questions which were answered correctly and she was able to grasp pharmacist&#39;s hand and squeeze with both of her hands.  Patient stated this is reason she does not donate blood and &#39;?&#39; and ginger have helped her in the past.  She stated she was feeling better and sat up against the wall.  When informed that paramedics were coming to assess. She stated no need and requested water and snack, stating possible that lack of food or water and being in the warehouse for awhile may have contributed.  Water and snack were denied to patient upon medical dispatch request.  Patient brought herself back to lying on right side until paramedics arrived.

I visited my doctor and they assessed me visually. I was also getting Migraine headaches. I had ocular issues on the left side with the headaches which were a daily event. They were consistent for the whole day.  I went back the next day after being called and I went to the ER. My D-Dimer was elevated but my other tests were normal. I felt very bad, and I was having flashes of pain across my body. Those continued for four to five weeks. The Migraines also persisted during that time. Over the counter Tylenol and Advil did not work. A growth in my right thigh was discovered during that time. It was about the size of an Almond.  It was identified as a Hematoma. I feel better now after eight weeks and I am starting to work out again. I am scheduled for a follow up on the Hematoma in my thigh.

                                                The day I got the vaccine I noticed a lot of muscle stiffness and joint pain especially in the shoulder, my ROM in the shoulder was limited. I had like really tense muscles in my lower back and pretty much most of my extremities. I remember taking Ibuprofen that night to go to sleep because I had a head ache. The next day I still kind of felt like recovering from a cold like still having the achiness and dizziness like your head is kind of heavy. Its been pretty persistent of those symptoms since then. On 03/23/2021 I had a doctor?s appt and they assured me that we lost our baby and they were worried about my blood pressure, it was 149/106 with pulse of 88. They told me that I should be worried about my blood pressure because that is extremely high and to take caution and monitor it. That is when I started doing the weekly reports. We do not know if the blood pressure was related to the pregnancy but it has come down since then. Since then I still have the occasional head ache and dizziness, right now I am actually sick with cough and mucus and I am schedule to take a Covid test. I had high blood pressure during pregnancy before.

                                                I fainted in my backyard on June 9th. I was brought to the hospital by ambulance and had elevated heart enzymes and a problem with my EKG. A subsequent CT scan was done and it was found that I had a massive saddle pulmonary embolism. I was air transferred to another hospital and given a TPA to break up the clot. I was in the ICU for 3 days and then the cardiac floor for 2 days. I also had a bleed where my central line was put in in my groin and a subsequent hematoma. The PE was most likely caused by a DVT in my right leg, believed to be caused because of a dislocated ankle and estrogen-based birth control.

                                                Patient was sitting in the post-vaccination chair, about 10 minutes after her vaccination time. She lost consciousness and fell to the floor. I instructed the technician to call 911 and went to the patient, who quickly regained consciousness. She sat back in the chair, and we gave her some water. She said she was feeling better when the EMT arrived.

                                                I got the vaccine, then was asked (due to having previous allergic reaction to Levaquin in the past, I was asked to wait 30 minutes) I got up and walked a total of 30 feet to sit in a chair. I felt completely normal, up until this point. I sat down and began to text my Mother that I had just got the vaccine &amp; I was told to wait 30 minutes, at this point (2 mins in) I felt normal. I sat my phone down on my lap and was just looking about. I began at that point (2 1/2-3 mins mark) seeing the tile floor morph; the blue tiles and the green tiles kept merging together and forming one color. Then my heart raced, immediately and I started having hot flashes that shot out my ears. My heart raced even more and at that point I had realized something wasn?t right. A National Guards member came up to me and had asked if I were okay, I explained I was not and something was not right. They took me to a medical area and made me take deep breaths, and made me drink some water. My BP was high, and my Pulse Ox had dropped slightly, and then went straight back to normal once they had asked me to stick my head between my knees and keep breathing deeply. Also, both of my ears had turned deep red/purple and they were VERY warm to the touch. They felt as if heat were tunneling out of them. The only way I can explain truly how I felt, and I have NEVER done it fully, I felt as if I was fainting. Out of nowhere I felt as if I was going to pass out ? but it didn?t happen. The entire ?spell? lasted about 20 mins? I was monitored for an additional 40 minutes and was allowed to leave.

                                                Brain fog approximately one hour post vaccine. Approximately 4 hours after the vaccine, chills started, approximately one hour after chills (5PM) temperature began to rise. After taking temperature, it was 103.8 degrees Fahrenheit. Took tylenol to attempt to lower temperature, however it did not minimize temperature significantly. In addition to the fever, the onset of intense migraine and severe dizziness occured. Took a second dose of tylenol and the temperature did not reduce- and raised to 104.9 degrees fahrenheit. I was unable to sleep the night the vaccine was administered as my head was throbbing and spinning so intensely. I may have had an increased  heart rate- which likely prevented my body from being able to settle, despite other side effects. I also had loss of appetite due to fever, and was able to eat normally until approximately 2 days after the vaccine. The fever broke approximately 24 hours later, however fatigue set in afterwards and lasted through the following week (felt mostly normal the Thursday after receiving the shot 3/18/2021).

I started to feel better while on the phone with 911 dispatcher. I was able to walk to the ambulance. Still felt a little woozy, but could breath fine. My chest got a little heavy while in back of ambulance, but not as severe. Was transported to ER.  Discharged same day Diagnosis- vaccine reaction; syncope near-vasovagal reaction

Immediately after she had a syncopal episode and was unresponsive for about 1 minute. We immediately called 911, lay her flat and raised her legs. She became responsive and was alert and oriented X  3. We were unable to get a BP reading but her color was improving and she remained alert. We repositioned her in a supine position and she had another syncopal episode. We raised her legs again and she improved immediately. EMS arrived shortly after. She remained alert and responsive  and was evaluated for about an hour and released to her spouse. She didn&#39;t want to be evaluated at the hospital. She made record of having a similar episode during a procedure at her doctor&#39;s office.

                                                After receiving the vaccine I was experiencing fatigue and tiredness. I went to bed that evening and experienced tachycardia for several hours. I went to the doctor the next morning as soon as possible and was given an EKG. The EKG came back normal, as did my blood pressure, but my doctor put me on a cardiac event monitor a few days later for two weeks to continue monitoring my heart. I had ongoing symptoms and went to the ER a few days later and had another EKG, blood tests, and a chest x-ray done, all of which came back clear. However, I am still wearing the heart monitor and will follow up with my doctor in a week when it is removed and the results come back to see if there is a reason for the tachycardia.

Approximately 4-5 minutes later I started feeling really hot. Then I started getting nauseous and dizzy. I tried to get up and walk to the pharmacy desk (vaccine occurred at pharmacy) but fainted midway there. I was out less than one minute and after sitting down and having some water and putting ice packs on my face I felt better. I have never in my life fainted before. I wasn?t nervous or scared to have the vaccine.   I followed up with my regular doctor on the Monday following the vaccine and had an EKG and bloodwork done all of which came back normal.

I refused further medical care because I felt better once the ambulance arrived. I visited my primary care doctor on 4/13/2021 to follow up.  He said it was likely an occular migraine.  A blood test was ordered and results came back as essentially normal.  I have been continuing to have dizzy spells, headaches, blurry vision and light sensitivity. An MRI of my  brain and spinal cord has been ordered for 4/29 to rule out other conditions.

Wednesday: same, tingling/numbness in legs - sometimes also in arms and upper back, but the tingling this day got a little less intense. Not as painful today. 12. Had follow-up appt on Thursday, April 22 - took more tests. Tingling/numbness in legs but felt like Wednesday as a little less painful - didnt feel it as much in arms/back. Felt more like when your hand falls asleep and blood comes rushing back into it, thats how my legs felt this day, so more soreness than pain. 11. Friday: Symptoms same as the past 1 days, feel like tingling is getting a tad better.

He reported that she had developed a severe headache and vomited.  She c/o leg and chest pain as well and he reports that she has a history of blood clots but no h/o migraine headaches.  At the time of the call his wife was feeling fine.  I advised that they discuss with PCP. Having none I advised that she discuss with Urgent Care.  I called him back about 6 hours later.  They had decided that since since she continued asymptomatic they were not going to seek clinical evaluation.  They believe that the symptoms were musculo-skeletal after &#34;spending the whole weekend laying a patio&#34;.

                                                3/20 vaccination  That evening of vaccination, I had really bad chills and a fever of 102.7. I took some Tylenol.  3/21 fever broke. No chills. Felt almost good as new.  3/22 I started having trouble breathing, almost like I couldn&#39;t fully breath in and that lasted pretty much until 4/23/2021. It felt like my chest was clogged, like your nose is clogged. Very uncomfortable. I started with a &#39;cough&#39;, almost like I wanted to cough but I kept it all in.  3/23, or 3/25 Urgent Care telemedicine due to being respiratory. Was prescribed an inhaler with albuterol with steroids. Neither seemed to have an affect. The following week, I took a COVID test; Neg. I went back to urgent care, said my lungs were all clear. Prescribed me &#39;oral medication&#39; and expectorant with codeine. Didn&#39;t have affect until I took the expectorant with the codeine.

Both hands were kind of numb feeling, but I&#39;d been laying on the right: I figured it&#39;d go away.  It didn&#39;t.  Heart racing and fatigue continued but right hand was noticeably pins &amp; needles.  Took a very hot shower around 11 PM and felt better, but right hand continues to be &#39;cold.&#39; -- Reporting this because I&#39;d never heard of any neurological(?) effects.  Probably just vaccine doing its thing and interacting with my slightly odd biochemistry.  Hopefully will be better in the morning!  ~ Also, an older member of the household received same lot of vaccine at same time: 0 side effects.

I was tested and a Deep Vein Thrombosis in my right leg. The swelling was in my left leg. There is no redness or swelling in that leg. I am taking subcutaneous injection of Lovenox 0.8 ml twice daily.  I was 27 weeks pregnant at the time.  I am currently experiencing injection site pain and I am seeing a maternal Fetal Medicine Specialist monthly. A birth plan has to made for when I deliver because of the medication.  The diagnosis states Right Popliteal and Proximal  calf DVT.  Due-Date-08-09-2021 Pregnancy-First Pregnancy

                                                The vaccine overstimulated my thyroid, which produced chemicals, creating sever tachycardia producing 170 BPM&#39;s. When my bloodwork was tested, my thyroid levels were over doubled the limits. I also had high blood pressure. Four days after receiving the vaccine I went to the hospital because I was experiencing a fast heart rate, I was extremely shaky (to where I could hardly stand) and I was having trouble breathing. After multiple tests at the hospital, the conclusion is that I have to let all of the thyroid hormones leave my body. So, basically, I&#39;m just waiting.

                                                The day within 10 minutes I started feeling hot and feverish. Then I started to feel lumping and cramping in my left breast and it persists and it turned in to nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. I also felt body cramping and both of breasts became extremely hard and was not comfortable. I also had muscle aches along with a mild fever for about a week. The pain was persistent. Then on day 2, the headaches started and I couldn&#39;t sleep because every time I moved the headache would cause me to vomit. So, I couldn&#39;t. My vision was blurry and I was not sure if it was due to the headache or the vaccine. I ended up going to the ER on 05/16/2021  for cramping in my left leg which was down by my ankle and was bruised. I&#39;m still experiencing heart palpitations, tiredness, cramps still happen in my breasts,  and there are still moments when my vision goes in and out.

After she got Covid 19 vaccine(janssen) on 06/17/21 about a few hours she said through email that she is fine except  very small chest pain.  Rph. told her that she needs to go to Emergecy Room if she gets worst.  And also told her not to take 2nd dose of Pfizer (based on CDC guidance).

                                                I got Johnson &amp; Johnson ?Janssen? on May 3. For reference, I have moderate to severe ME/CFS and vestibular migraine. I had COVID in December, was bedridden for two months, and almost recovered to baseline before the jab. Here?s my V timeline:  Day 1: May 3   Several mins after J&amp;J: Huge hot flash and vertigo spin that went away immediately   30 mins after: Felt drunk  Rest of evening: Extra sleepy  Day 2-3:  Extra dizziness and fatigue, mostly in bed. Definitely felt like I was fighting something.  Day 4: Vertigo attack.  Days 5-11: Felt better than I had since before having COVID! Less dizziness, more energy. My post-Covid symptoms such as orthostasis had greatly improved.? My resting heart rate was sometimes in the 70s!?  Day 12: ADVERSE EVENT: I felt like I got COVID all over again, but less severe. Nevertheless, my feeling of breathlessness was enough to send me to urgent care. I also had chest pain/heaviness, extra dizziness, and increased heart rate (117 resting). EKG at urgent care showed abnormalities similar to EKG I had in December when I first had Covid. So, I ended up in the emergency room. No clot or heart blockage. Doctor seemed to think either I was having a delayed reaction to the vaccine, or this was somehow Covid related.???  Day 13: Woke up feeling better until I had breakfast and had to poop. After doing that, I got so exhausted I landed back in bed all afternoon. This was another problem I had during Covid.? At least my resting heart rate was more normal, 98.  Day 14: ??Vertigo kicks in on top of everything else. Xanax is the only thing that helps my vertigo so I took that and was in bed all day.  Day 15: Didn?t sleep well but a little better.  Day 16: Chest pain and breathlessness are worse again. They got worse after I took a shower upon waking up.???  Day 51 (Today, 6/22/21): Chest pain and breathlessness are much better. Still have extra dizziness. Resting heart rate is usually between 88-100 now. Orthostasis has improved but not gone.

At the time she was doing light cardio exercise including jumping jacks and lunges.    On arrival stroke scale - 3 for facial palsy, left arm drift, and mild dysarthria. CT H  demonstrated hyperdense R MCA which corresponded with a filling defect in the R MCA (M2/M3 segment) c/w thrombosis; her CTa neck was normal and there were no e/o hemorrhage. Furthermore, this same CTa showed extensive bilateral PE. An extended stroke alert was called and she was given IV tenecteplase at 1250pm and underwent thrombectomy.   2 weeks ago (6/2) she was seen in clinic for sudden onset shortness of breath, thought at that time by that clinician to be most likely exercise-induced asthma vs less likely ACS. She was advised to use her already written albuterol and had follow up in 2 days (6/4). At that time it was noted she had more SOB with exercises and increased chest tightness that were both relieved with inhaler use.   She has a family history of strokes: Maternal uncle and maternal aunt strokes in their 40s Recent surgeries/immobility/travel: No surgeries, no more than a 2 hour car ride Smoking history: Dialy cannabis smoking but no tobacco smoking Age appropriate cancer screen: Yes  Family history of cancer: breast cancer in grandmother   Baseline functional status Full IADL&#39;s and A&amp;O x4.   At time of ICU consult, temp 98, BP 140/89, HR 88, RR 18.  Patient received: intraop NS, Versed, fentanyl, tenecteplase for thrombectomy Labs notable for All labs wnl  35 y.o female with no significant PMH on OCP presented with shortness of breath and slurred speech and LUE weakness found to have acute right M1 occlusion. She underwent thrombolysis with successful recanalization. Deficits resolved. She was also found bilateral PE and non occlusive DVT. Repeat imaging stable. TTE with evidence of small PFO. Today, she is feeling well, denies shortness of breath or new neurological complaints/deficits.    1. R MCA infarct s/p TNK and thrombectomy 6/14 with no residual deficits - secondary to paradoxical embolism. Appreciate neurology recommendations. Small PFO found on TTE, appreciate cardiology evaluation for closure.  2. Bilateral PE/non occlusive DVT - mildly elevated homocysteine level. Rest of hypercoagulable workup pending. Continue heparin gtt, transition to Pradaxa with Lovenox bridging.

Additional information was also received on 22-JUN-2021 from a literature article:  The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included codeine allergy, migraines, depression, and chronic thrombocytopenia. Patient had no adverse events following any previous vaccine and no recent abortive therapy. The patient had no cerebral venous sinus thrombosis risk factors. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of administration not reported, batch number: 1805025) dose was not reported, administered on 08-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included aripiprazole, bupropion hydrochloride, butalbital/caffeine/paracetamol, fluoxetine, propranolol hydrochloride, risperidone, and topiramate.  On an unspecified date in APR-2021 around 8 PM, patient presented to emergency room (ER) with a severe frontal headache since around 2 PM. She took TYLENOL and marijuana candy for relief at 4 PM with no help. Patient had computerized tomography (CT) venogram and CT head at 10:19 PM with normal results. She was given Toradol, Compazine, Decadron, and magnesium and discharged at 2 AM. Her platelet count at that time was 114 x10*3/mcL and was consistent with the patient&#39;s description of chronic thrombocytopenia. On an unspecified date in APR-2021 at 2 AM,  the patient presented to ER. She again had an ocular headache that was different and clearly more severe than her typical migraines. Still had significant nausea and vomiting along with photophobia. Unspecified laboratory results and imaging were reviewed. She again received morphine, Toradol, Reglan, Benadryl, dexamethasone. She was discharged at 06:00 feeling a little bit better. On 15-APR-2021 at 22:30, the patient had an acute worsening of headache and experienced  loss of consciousness. At 23:30, her husband found her unresponsive and called EMS. The patient presented to emergency room at 01:30 after sustaining a seizure in route and was subsequently intubated on arrival. She had a Glasgow coma scale of 1 with fixed pupils and no gag reflex. Platelet count was 10 x10*3/mcL and reached a nadir of 9 x10*3/mcL. The D-dimer peak value was 13.47 mcg/mL, the fibrinogen nadir was 128 mg/dL, international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.2 and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 24.1 seconds. The result of a SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was negative, and Heparin-platelet factor (PF)4 test result was positive (value of 2.2). CT head without contrast was performed which revealed intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage with significant sulcal and cisternal effacement and mild migration of the cerebellar tonsils below the level of the foramen magnum. Intracranial hemorrhage locations were also reported as the right temporal lobe and left cerebellar hemisphere within the literature article. Increased density within the right transverse, sigmoid and superior sagittal sinus and questionably with in the sagittal sinus may reflect underlying dural venous sinus thrombosis. The patient was also found to have sigmoid sinus thrombosis. Neurology and neurosurgery evaluated the patient around 03:00 in person. Independently, imaging and clinical presentation was deemed to be incompatible with life. Because of the sedating medications required for intubation and subsequently her sodium rising to 170, the brain death physical examination by neurology was not performed. Repeat imaging to evaluate central nervous system vasculature was under consideration by the clinical team. Action taken with vaccine was not applicable. The outcome was recovering for severe frontal headache, ocular headache, nausea, vomiting, and photophobia, and the outcome of seizure, thrombocytopenia, cerebral hemorrhage, dural venous sinus thrombosis, loss of consciousness and sodium level high was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, Life Threatening, and Disability Or Permanent Damage). This case, from Same Literature article is linked to 20210354798, 20210408478, 20210428484, 20210407314, 20210416236, 20210444498, 20210415297, 20210439653, 20210444501, 20210444497 and 20210448310.  Additional information was received on 22-JUN-2021 from a literature article.  The following information was updated and incorporated into the case narrative: no cerebral venous sinus thrombosis risk factors, additional late signs/symptom included loss of consciousness (added as event), additional location of sigmoid sinus thrombosis and (intra)cerebral hemorrhage locations of the right temporal lobe and left cerebellar hemisphere, timeline of events, platelet nadir, other laboratory results, and linked case numbers.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V3: Follow-up from literature confirms no CVST risk factors, symptoms, anatomic location of CVST, and lab tests.  This case concerns a 35-year-old white female with a history of migraines, depression, and chronic thrombocytopenia who was hospitalized for cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and thrombocytopenia 7 days after vaccine. Concomitant medications included aripiprazole, bupropion hydrochloride, butalbital/caffeine/paracetamol, fluoxetine, propranolol, risperidone, and topiramate. On an unspecified date the patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with a severe frontal headache. A computerized tomography (CT) venogram and CT of the head were unremarkable. She was given Toradol, Compazine, Decadron, and magnesium and discharged. Her platelet count at that time was 114, thought to be consistent with the patient&#39;s description of chronic thrombocytopenia. The patient later presented again to the ED with a severe ocular headache. She was evaluated and discharged again with morphine, Toradol, Reglan, Benadryl, dexamethasone.  On day 7, the patient had an acute worsening of headache and was found unresponsive that night. She was taken back to the ED by EMS, sustained a seizure in route and was intubated on arrival. She had no gag reflex. Sodium was 170, platelet nadir was 10, D dimer was 13.47 mcg/mL, Anti-PF4 ELISA was 2.2 and COVID test was negative. A CT revealed intraparenchymal and subarachnoid hemorrhage with mild migration of the cerebellar tonsils below the level of the foramen magnum as well as a suggestion of an underlying dural venous sinus thrombosis. She was determined to have brain death. Based on evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS, per definition from Brighton Collaboration), the low platelet count and temporal relationship to vaccination, we consider the events to have a plausible relationship with vaccination.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent condition included antiphospholipid syndrome. The patient had no allergies reported. On 14-JAN-2021, the patient was tested positive for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) via the COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of administration was not reported, batch number: 201A21A and expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total, administered on 08-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medication included Xarelto (rivaroxaban). On 05-JUN-2021, the patient experienced onset of chills, fatigue, headache and was tested positive for COVID-19 via COVID-19 PCR test [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) test positive, confirmed covid-19 infection and confirmed clinical vaccination failure]. The patient went to emergency room visit and was hospitalized (date unspecified in report). On 05-JUN-2021, she had acute right middle cerebral artery (R MCA) ischemic stroke (cerebrovascular accident), 2/2 M1 occlusion (cerebral artery occlusion) status post (S/P) thrombectomy &#39;(HCC)&#39; (as reported), and had atrial septal defect [patent foramen ovale (PFO)]. On 12-JUN-2021, she was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation. The patient was hospitalized for 8 days. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of the atrial septal defect, cerebral artery occlusion, cerebrovascular accident, chills, confirmed covid-19 infection, fatigue, headache, thrombectomy, SARS-COV-2 test positive and confirmed clinical vaccination failure was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, Other Medically Important Condition, Life Threatening, and Disability Or Permanent Damage). This report was associated with product quality complaint : 90000187446.  Version created to amend previously reported information on 23-JUL-2021. Upon review following information amended. Event chills, fatigue and headache were updated from labeled to unlabeled. Additional information received from Consumer Complaint Vigilance Organization on 27-JUL-2021. The following information updated and incorporated into the case narrative. product quality complaint number was added.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V1:  Follow-up information updates the labeling and adds a product quality complaint number; this does not change the previous assessment.  This spontaneous report received from a Regulatory Authority [VAERS ID: 1463769] concerns a 35-year-old female patient of unspecified ethnicity who had an acute right middle cerebral artery (R MCA) ischemic stroke with cerebral artery occlusion and was hospitalized 58 days after receiving the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. Concurrent condition included antiphospholipid syndrome. The patient was previously COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test positive 3 month prior to vaccination.  On the day of hospitalization, the patient noted chills, fatigue, headache; COVID-19 PCR test was positive.  The patient underwent thrombectomy &#34;HCC&#34;; atrial septal defect was noted.  The subject&#39;s anti-phospholipid syndrome and SARS-COV-2 infection may have increased the risk for the events to occur. However, considering the temporal relationship with vaccination, a relationship with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the relationship is considered indeterminate.

                                                At 2:50 am on 3/9/21 (about 7.5 hours after receiving the vaccine), I awoke to  my body shaking intensely.  It felt like a muscle spasm or like electricity was being pulsed through my body. First it would happen in one leg, and then the leg would curl up under my body. Then it would spasm in my chest and my arms would be drawn inward. Then the other leg, or sometime multiple locations at once. I didn&#39;t feel cold at the time. This lasted for 40 minutes total. I took 1000 mg Acetaminophen at  3:00 am.  Then, as the shaking lessened, I became very cold. I put on lots of clothes and laid on a heating pad under my comforter. Sometime later, I became very hot. Throughout the night into the morning, I felt feverish and chilled back and forth. At 6:00 am I took 200 mg Ibuprofen. I then spent the rest of the day with fever, chills, and body aches. Everything was achy and I was very tired. I slept well that night. The next day I was fatigued.

                                                She got the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine at Yankee stadium. Roughly 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine, she started to feel nauseous, develop crampy abdominal pain, and feel lightheaded. She went home and took a shower and lay down in bed. When she got up she again felt nauseous and dizzy. She threw up a total of 6 times, none of which were bloody. She had several episodes of diarrhea throughout the day. Given her ongoing symptoms she presented to the ED.   On arrival, she was febrile to 39.5C, and tachycardic to 145 with BP 98/56 and SpO2 100% on room air. She was given zofran, 1L NS, and tylenol. On repeat, her BP was 75/35 (though no longer tachycardic). She was written for 2 more liters of NS and then endorsed to medicine. Her BP improved w/ SBP in the 90s-110s with continued myalgias, headaches.

She never lost consciousness and felt better after a few minutes. She eventually sat back up and stayed in the waiting area for a while longer to be monitored.  She did state that she felt a cold rush in her chest right before she became lightheaded. She ended up feeling fine and went home.

I got hot and sweaty and horrible tunnel vision, I almost fainted. I laid down on one of their medical beds to recover while the sweet nurse fanned me.  I was observed over 30 min before leaving.  I woke up yesterday and felt weird along with bodyaches, chills, joint pains, random stinging sensations throughout my body (almost like a pen prick), sporadic short headaches and muscle cramps.  I left work yesterday and didn?t even go in today.

I stabilized her and directed my staff to call 911 and store management. Within 15 seconds of its inception, she regained consciousness. We ended the phone call for next level care. We gave the patient an ice pack for her neck and a bottle of water. Once aware again, she mentioned that she hadn&#39;t eaten anything today. We got her a candy bar as well. Within 20 minutes, she was able to walk out of the store under her own power.

                                                36 y.o. female referred for the above chief complaint.   She has no significant medical history and presented with a headache that became severe 3 days ago.  She received the Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine on March 25th and had a mild headache following that which she attributed to the vaccine.  3 days ago the pain became excruciating and was associated with vomiting.  This prompted presentation to the ED where she was treated with Dilaudid. She was discharged home and has been using her mom&#39;s headache cocktail with some transient relief.  She presented back to the ED today with continued symptoms.  MRV revealed a venous sinus thrombosis and neurology was therefore consulted.   She has no history of clots personally or in the family.  Her dad did have a stroke in his 50s.  Patient otherwise denies any other associated speech change, vision change, extremity numbness, extremity weakness, coordination difficulty, or dizziness. Patient admitted to the neurology ICU and started on anticoagulation.

                                                A few minutes after the injection I felt strange sensations in my arms. About half an hour after the injection started feeling a little dizzy and tightness in chest and throat. Later in the evening I had mild flu like symptoms, chills aches. The following morning was a Sunday and was feeling better but later that day throat started hurting. Throat progressively became swelled and irritated and extremely sore. Flu like symptoms returned. Throat was swelled and to the peak of pain on Monday night. Tuesday morning I was seen at a clinic and it was a little bit better. It started getting better after that but also it has now been a week and a half and throat is still a little bit irritated. I also have brown splotches that appeared on my face either the night of the vaccine or the morning that have not went away.

Patient sat down to try and relieve symptoms and after sitting a minute proceeded to feint. She regained consciousness within a few moments and was then disoriented for a short time. EMS arrived and evaluated her and since she was pregnant she agreed to go with them for further evaluation. We followed up with her the next day, she was feeling better having recovered fully and was told at hospital everything was fine medically with her health and her pregnancy.

                                                I got the vaccine at 4pm at the pharmacy where I work. I had no symptoms except for very mild local injection discomfort but was able to do my usual normal activities. At 2 am that evening, I woke up with  a lot of pain in my legs, I felt they were so heavy to move around in bed. My lower back was extremely painful too, I tried to stand up to walk a bit, the pain was very severe and I couldn?t stand straight, it was very hard to drag my feet, they felt very heavy and my muscled were painful to the touch even. So went back to bed, and was in agony. I had to go to work in the morning to open the store I work at until they find me coverage. Driving was very hard with my painful legs. J reached the store and I was walking very slowly, I couldn?t have a full control over my legs, they were painful waist down, and felt very heavy, when I sat down my muscles were painful wherever pressure was applied to them (from the chair).  Lightheadedness: I felt lightheaded when I woke up from bed at night to try to walk and ease the pain. So decided to go back to bed to prevent falls. At work, while walking and sitting, I had episodes of very light headidness and sat often on the floor and lifted my legs. Measured my blood pressure on 3 occasions it was 90/50  then 100/50 then 110/60. One time only I fainted where my colleagues put me down and lifted my legs.  At 8am (morning of 3/9/20201) I had a feeling of  heavy breathing. Needed to take deep breath as if my lung muscles were tired and needed to take deep breath to fill them with enough air. At work and because of the increased intensity of muscles pain, I started to breath faster and deeper coz I was in agony   Headache: severe and excruciating headache started from 6am to 12pm on 3/9/21.   Throughout the symptoms, I refused to take medications to let the vaccine run its course. My family drove me back from work coz I was weak and lightheaded and in severe pain at 10.30am. Came home, took one Advil 200mg at 11am. I was completely pain free  at 12pm. Lungs still felt weak, needed to breath deeper for two days but then got better.

But then by Tuesday (4/6) of the next week I started feeling pain in my right arm and then sometimes I would get the sensation of it falling asleep.  I havent felt that sensation anymore since Sunday (4/11).  By Friday (4/9) I started feeling pressure in my chest in the mornings.  I have been having these two discomforts till today.  Yesterday was the worst feeling it was morning and then all of a sudden everything went white and I was about to faint then my heart started racing so fast.  I have never experienced any of these symptoms in my life.  I am not a person that gets sick or is sick of something.

                                                Patient had a reaction immediately after the JJ vaccine. Patient passed out for 10-15seconds, her body stiffened up, she felt hot and then cold and started sweating excessively. Patients eyes closed briefly and then opened. Patient then became conscious and was unware what had happened.  Patient is not on any medication and had not eaten all morning. After administering the vaccine a small amount of blood came out. I gave her a cotton ball to apply on the area and to hold. After 20-30 seconds she said she felt faint and hot all of a sudden. Her body then went limp and her eyes began to close. Her body then stiffened up for a few seconds. After shouting her name a few times she regained consciousness and was able to talk. she didn&#39;t realize what had happened. Her body was fine again but she had urinated during the episode.  Upon speaking to the patient I learnt that she was nervous about the vaccination and she had felt dizzy in the past when giving blood. I observed the patient over the next 45 minutes. Her speech was fine, she was still a little light headed. She was in her seat for 40 minutes, then I asked her to stand and to move a little to see how she was. She was able to walk a bit but then sat down as she still felt light headed. She than sipped on water and continued talking and seemed to get some energy back.

                                                The day of the vaccine I was told that my arm might be sore. I felt sore right away and as soon as I got in the car to drive home I was extremely tired and I slept for the entire six hour car ride home. I was very fatigued that night and then I got a bad headache, fever and it lasted for 48 hours. After that, the headache was less intense and they were intermittent but my arm still hurt and I couldn&#39;t lay on it. I was still fatigued for a week. On the fourth day I started to get a weird feeling of vibrations and twitching all over my body. It is especially worse in my temple. It has been a month but I still get the twitching in different parts of my body. My face, arms, legs and temples. It is in different places. It happens less often now, it is not all day but it is still daily and mostly in my head and my legs. I had it happen in my temples last night.  I had my menstrual cycle since the vaccine and it was about three days later than expected. I had a lot of blood clots which was unusual for me. I have had flu like symptoms this week and I have a cough, runny nose and headaches but I am planning on trying to go to the doctor this week.

                                                I was taking a shower the night of 04/28/21 and I had a bad pain in my right leg. It felt like it could be a blood clot. The area was swollen and I was in a lot of pain. My blood pressure started getting high and it kept going up. On the way to the hospital, I started getting a headache and shortness of breath. I tried to elevate my leg on the way there. I took an aspirin. I had to sit in the waiting room for 2 1/2 hours and my pain in my leg and headache continued. Once I was taken back, they ran a few tests. I was told that my D-Dimer was elevated which indicates a blood clot. I was checked for a pulmonary embolism and that was negative. I was given a blood thinner because an ultrasound technician was not on duty. I went home at 4 am. I went back for an ultrasound the next day for my entire leg. Everything came back normal. The pain slowly went away.

Pain in my ankles, both feet began about a week later. Stress test done on May 4 with normal results. Followed up with doctor on May 5 for ankle pain and hip pain. Blood work tested Inflammation, Autoimmune, Rheumatoid, Thyroid all came back normal. Another d dimer came back elevated at. 65. Was prescribed buspirone for anxiety. Had a CT Scan and Venus Doppler- all came back clear. I still have pain in rib area where I feel like a pulled something. I am afraid to exercise, I still have pain in back and side. Will follow up with one more d dimer then hematologist if still elevated.

                                                patient felt light headed and a person standing by notified pharmacy. I, staff RPh, assessed patient quickly and helped her to a supine position on the floor with legs elevated. Patient fainted as she was being helped to the floor. Patient&#39;s eyes was dilated, we called 911 and I grabbed the BP unit and checked pulse. Pt regained consciousness after about 7 to 8 seconds. Pt was able to identify herself and answer all questions. We grabbed an orange juice for the patient as she had not had anything to eat and had just worked out. Pt&#39;s BP was 108/90 and remained around that range for about 5 or so readings. PT drank and was encouraged to lie in supine position with legs elevated for 15 more minutes even though she stated she thought she was fine. Pt waited until 12:55pm and also stated she had fainted with a past blood draw. Pt appeared fine by 12:55pm, bp still around 100/80, pupils is back to normal. 911 was cancelled per patients request shortly after regaining consciousness.

She was able to breath, her eyes shut. we immediately called 911. She woke up in about less than 1 minute. The EMS checked her and she declined. She was able to ride home with a family member.

Arm soreness was worse and was now affecting my whole right arm and not just injection site. Hurt to move right arm any at all and chest felt like an elephant was sitting on it. Fever at 6am was at 102.5 F. Treated pain and fever with Tylenol. Temp went down to 101.9 at next check. Continued running a fever all day, shifting from sweating to shivering and being cold. Was very tired and stayed in bed most of the day.  Temp was down to 100.5 when went to bed. Arm is still sore today and woke up covered in sweat. Temp was at 99.9. Still very tired but chest tightness has gone down.

                                                Immediately after shot was administered, my entire left arm started tingling down to my left pinky finger. I become overheated and had to sit down and fan myself from fainting. After 20 minutes, I was able to drive home. That evening, I wasn&#39;t able to sleep. My entire body was in severe pain, had a bad headache, and sweated through the sheets. The following day at work, I ran a low grade fever, was pale and felt like I didn&#39;t sleep for weeks. Ran a low grade fever all day. The following day, I took off work and tried to rest. On Friday morning, experienced chest pains. Took Ibuprofen and it subsided. Still have pain in left arm.

As I was about to check her blood pressure, she seemed to lose consciousness. Her eyes rolled back in her head, and she seemed to be out of it for a few seconds. She came back to about 10 seconds later. She was pale, sweating, and had urinated on herself. I gave her a cold rag to wipe her face off. We called 911. Kept reminding the patient to take slow, deep breaths. Ambulance came and checked patient out, but she refused to be transported to hospital. I called to check on the patient later that night. She stated she had taken a nap when she got home, but was overall feeling better

The patient briefly lost consciousness for approximately 60 to 90 seconds.  The pharmacist was able to catch the patient as she lost consciousness and began to fall from the chair where she was seated.  The patient was then moved to a recovery position on the floor, where she then regained consciousness shortly thereafter.  The pharmacist attended to the patient while she was unconscious and as she began to regain consciousness.  The patient&#39;s husband was contacted and he then presented to the pharmacy.  After being monitored in the pharmacy area for approximately 15 to 20 minutes after fully recovering, the patient&#39;s husband then took the patient home.

I tested positive for COVID-19 on June 15th with worsening symptoms, however, mild respiratory issues. I began having issues with double vision on June 17th and contacted the emergency nurse hotline on June 18th as I had lost the ability to walk/stand, experienced waves of paralysis, numbness in hands and feet, rapid heart rate, and vision and hearing impairment. I was directed to the ER by the on-call Dr to test for possible encephalitis and have an EKG. I was discharged after a few hours. These symptoms align with Guillain-Barre Syndrome, however, I did not receive a spinal tap to confirm.

I went to the ER after having sharp pains in my chest and a racing heartbeat. I still have issues with my heart and when my insurance starts, I will be finding a doctor.

Symptoms became under control after 50mg of Benadryl. Thick mucus lingered until the next day. Increased heart rate leveled off after Benadryl took affect. Fully recovered by the following day.

I called for a nurse and we lowered her to the floor together. Blood pressure was low (around 100/60) Her pupils started to return to normal and she was able to converse with us. Blood pressure increased slightly but was erratic. Emergency service responders made call to take to hospital because blood pressure would not stabilize

                                                I had the expected side effects of fever and chills that evening around 8pm on the evening of the vaccine (3/13/21) and it went away by 1am. The next morning (3/14) I felt a bit tired but still had enough energy to go on my usual 8-mile run.  Just when I thought the side effects had passed, I was woken up that night by chest tightness and shortness of breath. I had to go to the ER on the evening of 3/14/21and got discharged around 2am of 3/15/21. They did and EKG and they said my heart and lungs are all in great shape and that this is probably just a vaccine side effect. They said they see it more often in Moderna but I guess it can happen with this one too. I just hope I?m not one of the rare cases that ends up in death.  I do have a history of allergies and asthma. I?m feeling better though, though I still feel something different in my chest.

I started getting very cold and shaking around 10:00 PM. My finger nails and lips started getting pale and my temperature started rising. The shaking stopped around 12:15 AM, but my fever continued as high as 101.4 throughout the night and into the morning. I continued taking Tylenol and the fever went away the morning of 3/12/21, but slight chills returned around noon that did not last long. I took more Tylenol that evening for a headache and noticed I had an on and off throbbing pain in my right ear.

Felt feverish (hot/cold flashes) as well around 3am; this improved after awaking (6am) after taking Tylenol. Felt dizzier than normal (prior condition) upon getting out of bed the next morning, but was resolved within 24 hours.

                                                I went to a community event (held at a church) for the COVID vaccine. After the vaccine, I wanted the 15 minutes and felt ok - just hot. I went out to my car and over the next few minutes - I was getting hotter - My face was extremely hot and flushed, and hives started developing on my arms and chest. They were burning and itching; my skin was hot to the touch. My chest felt tight and my throat felt swollen, but I was able to breathe (breathe felt a little short, but I was able to take a full breathe). I was also dizzy and felt nauseous. I went to the ER, where they treated me for anaphylaxis with Benadryl, Pepcid, Breathing treatment, and a steroid. After about an hour or so I felt fine, and the dr gave me some medications to take over the next few days.

                                                I took the J&amp;J shot roughly at 11:50a, and naturally felt the immediate burn, and swear I felt the liquid moving through my arm. My arm was immediately tingly and numb simultaneously, and I felt...light and weird. Around 2p, I began feeling feeling lightheaded and weak, and at 6p, I had chills, severe weakness, dizziness and nausea. I couldn&#39;t stand up longer than 2 minutes without wanting to vomit and faint. I couldn&#39;t even stand up long enough to wash dishes, prepare a bowl of grapes to eat or shower. Throughout the night, I sweated so terribly from the chills to the point that my bed was soaked to the mattress pad, and currently at 2:02p on April 6th, I&#39;m still experiencing the extreme weakness, nausea, and chills.

                                                Immediately after I got it I felt different. Fight or flight response kicked in. My heart started racing and chest felt tighter. It felt like I just ran a marathon. My breathing increased and I felt very dizzy and lightheaded. I stayed in the store and walked around hoping symptoms wouldn&#39;t get worse for 25 minutes then left. I had my three small children with me and wanted to get them home. I called my husband who is a physician and told him everything I was experiencing. He told me to stay in the store to see how things went. I then drove home to monitor my symptoms. I had post nasal drip and it exacerbated over the next few weeks. I was on two different antibiotics because it felt like I had a bad ear infection. It never went away. I saw an ENT and my tympanaplasty that I had as a child blew. I have a large hole in my ear drum currently and very dizzy. I am getting a CT of my ear this Wednesday and I will have to have surgery in the next few months for another tympanoplasty.

                                                As the vaccine was being administered into my left deltoid, the vaccine hurt at the injection site and I immediately felt very strange and felt a rushing sensation to my head and throughout my body, with a concentration in my upper body.  It felt like an out of body experience: I fainted, hitting my head on the adjacent wall and fell to the ground, where the impact caused a bruise to my shoulder and back.  It was reported to me that I lost consciousness for about 10 seconds.  I felt disoriented, but lucid when I came to.  I was not exactly sure what happened, but I could feel that I hit my head on the right side and asked if I fainted since I was disoriented and on the floor.  With assistance, I was able to sit back on the bench, but felt extremely dizzy, light headed, fuzzy/strange type of blurry vision, and intense sweating.  I did not feel well and knew I would have an unsteady gait if I attempted to stand.  After about 15 minutes, I felt well enough to return home.

She was breathing  and had a low pulse. She became responsive in 1-2 mins and started responding to our questions. We gave her glucose tablet and some water as she stated she had not had anything to eat for the past 2  hours. We monitored  her for additional 30 mins and let her leave when she was normal.

                                                Fever got to 104.6,  freezing  so badly couldn?t feel hot water.  Our hands turned purple on the top and our fingers turned white, as if circulation issue - example of how it physically looked.  Couldn?t sit up without almost passing out.  Couldn?t walk without assistance.  Body aches so bad - I?ve never experienced this type of ache, and I?ve had three children.  This all started around 6pm same day of receiving the vaccine.  My husband started the same shortly after.  With exact symptoms, plus he had shortage of breath.  Fevers finally broke 1am- then we both felt better, until later the next day.   Body aches continued, not as badly as day before.  Sweating and chills.  Husband woke up the next night completely drenched from fever breaking.  Fatigue and soreness followed for next couple days.  By Tuesday April 6th finally felt normal again.   Minus continued sore arm.  Wanted to repost due to high fevers, feelings of passing out, and our hands turning purple.  Would think off coincidence if had it not happened to both of us.

                                                After I got the vaccine my heart rate went over 100 and I had to lay down at the hospital to recover because I was so dizzy. On Saturday night and Sunday I felt some normal side effects like a severe headache, chills, nausea, and fatigue. Monday I felt better than normal and I thought I was in the all clear. Today (Tuesday) I woke up feeling like I had a stroke. I can still lift both arms and both sides of my face, but I can not think and feel like I am dying. I am scared to go to the hospital. I am unable to work. I feel incredibly emotional and unable to think. I feel so tired and the pain at the injection site is now even worse. I am getting chest pains, dizzy spells, really bad headache, and it feel like I am in a dream state unable to do things I normally can do. I am not okay and really regret getting the vaccine. I had no prior health concerns and probably would have survived covid, but it feels like I may never get my mental functioning back again.

I have never experienced a hormonal change the way I did when my period began. This would have been the first cycle after receiving the vaccine. The first day it started, (4/9/21), I felt like I was having a panic attack, anxiety attack or something similar. Now, I do not actually know what these attacks feel like, I am just stating that I assume this is what it feels like. I was not able to focus, felt like I was freaking out, almost as if I had taken some sort of pill that sped up my heart and made me jittery. I just wanted to report, incase others were experiencing the same issue. It lasted only the one day.

Patient was prescribed Fioricet (butalbital/acetaminophen/caffeine). 2021-04-05 - patient developed right-sided neck pain 2021-04-06 - patient got tested for COVID-19, resulted negative on 2021-04-07 2021-04-08 - patient seen at Medical Center emergency department for headache and right-sided neck pain that shoots to (2021-04-08 cont.) the head and shoulder, for which patient self-medicated with ibuprofen. Patient reported to ED provider that using ibuprofen nearly relieves headache and makes her functional and had the most improvement the day she visited the ED prior to her visit. Patient received a CT scan of the head without contrast that was unremarkable. Patient was diagnosed with headache and neck sprain and was prescribed ibuprofen 600 mg, take 1 tablet by mouth every 8 hours, and diazepam 5 mg, take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times a day as needed for muscle spasm. 2021-04-12 - patient developed left lower extremity pain 2021-04-14 - patient followed up with Neurologist outpatient as directed by ED provider and was advised to get an MRV and left lower extremity doppler. Patient was prescribed tramadol 50 mg and butalbital/acetaminophen/caffeine (Fioricet) by the Neurologist. 2021-04-15 - patient presented to Medical Center ED before outpatient MRV and LLE doppler could be done due to worsening right-sided neck pain and inability to ambulate comfortably due to lower extremity pain that had been worsening over several days. Upon examination, there is subtle swelling to left lower extremity and doppler revealed multiple DVTs in left lower extremity. CT head without contrast was unremarkable, however, CT venogram of the brain reveals thrombi of the right transverse sinus and sigmoid sinuses, as well as IJ. Patient was initiated on argatroban and admitted to inpatient at the time of this report. &#34;Heparin induced platelet antibody&#34; and &#34;lupus anticoagulant evaluation&#34; tests are ordered and pending.

                                                I got the vaccine on 4/7/21 at approx. 10am. Soreness at injection site started about an hour later. At approx. 3pm that day I began to have body aches and chills and had a low grade fever and a very bad and continuous headache. Those symptoms lasted approx. 24-36 hours. By Friday 4/9, I was feeling better and fever was gone. Starting approx. Sun 4/11 I began to have a dull headache wrapping around the back of my head/neck and began having muffled hearing (bilateral, but more prominent in left ear). On 4/15 at approx. 1:15pm I was sitting at my desk and suddenly my heart rate went from resting heart rate to 150. I could feel the pounding in my head and ear and also placing my hand over my heart. I tried to stand up to walk around thinking that might help my heart rate, but I felt faint, so I immediately drove myself to urgent care. My heart rate came down and was back to normal approx. 5-10 min from onset. EKG and CT were done in the ER. I was released approx. 5-6 hours after arrival and told to treat headache with Tylenol or Ibuprofen (which I have not done so far because I normally try not to take medications), and follow up with my primary doctor in a week. Headache and muffled hearing are still present today (4/17), predominately affecting left ear.

While in the shower I became dizzy and light headed to the point I fainted. I contacted my family physician. I was told as long as I was feeling okay to be on bed rest for the day with my feet elevated and to continue to drink lots of fluids. I was fine the following day.

Fearing she was having an allergic reaction she came to the pharmacy counter to report this.  I grabbed an Epi-pen and took her blood pressure which was normal but her heart rate was 130 bpm, EMS was also called.  At this point the patient realized she was not having an allergic reaction but a panic attack.  EMS arrived, checked out the patient who&#39;s blood pressure had returned to normal at this point and told her when she was comfortable she was free to leave.  She stayed in the store for another hour before leaving.

After receiving her vaccine, she did not remain seated and fell to the floor immediately upon standing. She was unconscious but still breathing and regained consciousness about 30-45 seconds after her partner and I went to her. She was alert and was able to question what happened. She said she felt &#34;tingly&#34; and nothing else. She remained on the floor until EMT arrived. She was taken to a local hospital after vitals were taken by EMT unit.

Patient reports two positive at home urine pregnancy tests on 4/30/21 and 5/1/21.  Conception likely occurred on or around 4/6/21.  Patient reports vaginal bleeding that started on 5/14/21.  Patient had transvaginal ultrasound on 5/17/21.  Impression: FIRST TRIMESTER ULTRASOUND, SINGLETON An early intrauterine singleton pregnancy is visualized. A fetal pole is visualized but fetal cardiac activity is NOT present. The fetal biometry is appropriate for gestational age. Anatomic survey is precluded by early gestational age. As the CRL &lt;7mm (measures 2.6mm) a definitive diagnosis of a missed miscarriage can not be made I would recommend a follow up ultrasound in 10-14d.  Follow up ultrasound on 5/27/21 could not visualize pregnancy.  Impression: The endometrium measures 14.39 mm, with heterogenous echotexture suggestive of retained products. The right and left ovaries appear normal.

                                                I received my COVID shot on Friday, July 09, 2021 around 12:40pm &amp; started feeling bad, which continued through the rest of that night. I had headache, chills, aches, feverishly hot skin, fatigue, and nausea. On the next day, Saturday July 10th, I thought I was feeling better so I left the house to go meet a friend for lunch. However while I was driving, I started feeling sick to my stomach again. I got very lightheaded, so I tried to pull over. I traveled up &amp; tried to pull over at the gas station, but I passed out before I could stop. When I woke up &amp; regained consciousness, two men from (the bike shop across the street) were helping me out of my vehicle. I didn&#39;t realize that I had passed out or had a wreck. According to the guys I was driving very slowly then my vehicle just sped up, hit the median, ran into a pole, then  went airborne before coming to a stop in the middle of the street. Thankfully, I was the only vehicle involved in the accident. The guys at the bike shop also surveillance which captured footage of my accident. The back of my neck was hurting bad &amp; I continued to feel nauseated. So I went hospital. They put me in a neck brace &amp; did x-rays on me, which eventually came back ok. So, they gave me a Toradol shot, prescribed me some muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatory pills.

                                                I got the vaccine, and within a couple of days, I started having chills, fatigue, nausea, muscle and body aches, and headaches. It got continually worse, and I eventually developed a migraine, blurred vision, tingling, severe nose bleeds, weakness (like peripheral neuropathy). The symptoms all got worse and worse, and I eventually went to the neurologist. They did a CT venogram; the results were normal. The BP was elevated, and they noted I had a really high heart rate. My blood work had abnormalities on the CBC and metabolic panels. I was sent back to my PCP and he found abnormal results in my blood work, plus he found abnormalities in the test for thyroid stimulating hormone. I still had elevated BP. A PCR COVID test was done, and I tested negative. They also tested for antibodies to see if I was responding to the vaccine; no antibodies were detected. They said it was weird and that I probably had lingering vaccine side effects that would go away, and in case the COVID test was wrong, I was advised to self-isolate. They plan to conduct further thyroid tests and blood work in the future to see if there are any changes. I am still having all the symptoms, and on 7/13/2021, I developed symptoms that are consistent either kidney stones or kidney infection. I plan to see my doctor to have this looked into.

                                                Immediately began to feel a headache, dizzy and nauseated.  The doctor on site had me lie down on the floor. Was starting to feel better so was able to sit up in a chair for about 15 minutes. Another wave of dizziness and nausea came over and was lying on the floor again. It was hard to breathe, but oxygen and HR were good. The doctor tried to give me juice to see if it was my blood sugar going low, but afterward, I still felt dizzy and nauseated. It was still hard to breathe. It felt like something was sitting on my chest. BP was elevated, oxygen levels were good, HR was good but I started to get a cold chill where my teeth were chattering. At that point (about 45 min to an hour) the symptoms had not gone away and the ambulance was called. Was transported to the local hospital where I received a liter of saline and Zofran for nausea.  BP was high, but oxygen levels and HR were good. The heart monitor showed no signs of arrhythmia or tachycardia so I was discharged. The doctor believes it was a side effect and not an allergic reaction.

I fainted at table, then my spouse didn&#39;t know when he came downstairs, he thought my head was just resting at the table. He asked if I wanted to walk to the couch to rest, and as he helped me do so, I fainted and he caught me and carried me to the couch. Recovered within 1 minute but my hearing was  fuzzy for a couple more minutes, sounded like static in my ears.  Other reactions were:  Standard ones I read could happen- Fever of 100.1 that lasted less than a day, chills, aches, warm feeling and fatigue.

The symptoms subsided about an hour later. Around 11pm, I started to have wheezing, chest tightness, and back pain. I have been using my inhaler and nebulizer since last night for the wheezing. I spoke to a doctor through phone who confirmed these aren&#39;t normal side effects from the vaccine.

It has run in the 90&#39;s and low 100&#39;s since then throughout the day today.

                                                Starting in the afternoon after my shot I started feeling extremely cold. I had chills and my teeth were actually chattering at one point it was so bad. This gradually got worse as the evening went on. With it I also started feeling weak and fatigued. By 8pm I started to have a headache. Throughout the night symptoms worsened and I had a fever and more serious headache. My head was pounding so badly. I couldn&#39;t sleep at all. I also had a couple hot flashes to where I woke up sweating. Then I would feel frozen again. The nausea started during the night too. I thought I would throw up but didn&#39;t. At one point my heart was racing so fast I was a little concerned something bad would happen to me and contemplated going to the hospital. By morning I felt a little better, still nauseous and with a bad headache. My body was a little weak. These symptoms lasted all day Thursday. By that Friday morning I only had a little weakness and slight headache. By mid day Friday I was pretty much back to normal.

This nurse was informed of this event a few minutes later and went over to assess patient. on a scale of 1-10, patient described the chest pressure as 2 or 3. She denied any other symptoms. No s/s of resp. distress notes. BP taken noted at 106/72, Pulse 71 pulse Ox on room air 99%.  Within a few minutes more of observing patient, she reported complete resolution of her chest pressure. She remained in observation area for a total of 30 minutes. BP notes at 96/67, PR 70. This nurse suggested for patient to eat some chips and hydrate to increase her BP but patient 97/67 BP was a normal for her since she was vegan. She probably couldn&#39;t have the chips. Also informed patient if symptoms  reoccur she should see medical attention. patient verbalized understanding.

Few hours later developed typical &#34;flu like symptoms&#34;.  Next day woke up and both arms, hands, legs and feet and side of face had pins and needles and felt numb. Heart rate sky rocketed and went to ER. Felt like I was going to pass out.  Took blood work at hospital and doctors reassured that the feeling should come back in my legs and arms. When I left  6 hours later my legs were still pins and needles and my joints began to hurt.  A week later and this feeling continues to come and go, but is not consistent.  My joints still randomly hurt and I am an active 38 year old with three kids.

                                                Within a hour of receiving the vaccine, I felt left shoulder and posterior neck discomfort. A few hours after, I felt flushed and slightly feverish with generalized body aches. 6-7 hours after the vaccine, I experienced extreme fatigue, extremely high fever that registered as &#34;err&#34; consecutively on the thermometer numerous times (min of 5 times checked), severe headache, worsening body aches, left flank pain, GI upset with nausea, congestion, dizziness and many heart palpitations. The high fever broke around 11pm and my temp was 102 when checked then and I was drenched in sweat. The fever continued to decrease throughout the next 12 hours. The extreme fatigue, severe headache, dizziness , GI upset and nausea continued throughout the day Saturday and most of Sunday.  I also experienced burning in my chest that radiated into both shoulders, anterior/posterior neck and between both shoulder blades in my back all day Saturday. The burning has decreased over this past week, but I am still experiencing it with some exertion, but not consistently.  Fatigue continues some and SOB at random times.

It was very scary. Day 4 I am more myself currently, but unsure of how things will go from here.

My stomach hurt, I was nauseated. I went through hot &amp; cold sweats &amp; chills. I got really light headed &amp; disoriented. I began to get a fever.  I felt far from flu symptoms. My heart was racing. I had to get into my shower repeatedly &amp; just lay. I cried. I dont recommend this to anyone! It has been 2 days &amp; i am still experiencing symptoms. I read the fact sheet for the Janssen shot. I am going to get a check up by a doctor. I feel like I am having an allergic reaction. I never felt so much pain in my life; my side effects are far from the flu symptoms.

After that I felt flushed, and around 5:30pm I had a fever and my heart rate began to rise and blood pressure drop.. My heart rate continued to rise until about 9:30pm, and then it began to fall. I also experienced a terrible headache, moderate body aches, and chills and hot flashes. But the diarrhea and rapid heart rate were very concerning to me--I felt very sure something was wrong. This morning I have a low heart rate and low blood pressure and I feel very weak, but other symptoms are gone. I don&#39;t have a primary care doctor and read that the diarrhea and heart symptoms could be signs of a severe reaction and I wanted to report it.

I woke up at 1am the the next day (4.10.21) with a severe migraine and my heart racing. The migraine was so severe that just bending down made my head pound with extreme pain. I felt very hot and was sweating profusely and my clothes were soaked. I was also very thirsty and drank several glasses of water. I took 4 ibuprofen as it had been 8 hours since my last dose and laid back down in bed and tried to relax. I fell back asleep within 1-2 hours. I felt fine the next morning but did have a slight headache, but it was nothing compared to what I woke up to during the night.

My left hand experienced the same shooting pain followed by tingling in my fingers. My right arm them experienced the same pain and tingling. I then began to sweat, get dizzy and felt like fainting. I have had pain and tingling in my hands and feet ever since, along with sensitivity. I also have pain in my joints and legs similar to what I imagine arthritis would feel like. I also have throbbing chest pain and pain in my legs since vaccination.

I have an IUD in place (placed in December 2017).  The first 24 hours after receiving the vaccine,  I had mild symptoms of headache, low grade fever and aches from the neck up. 2 days after receiving my vaccine, my period began and continued as a light period until April 14, 2021.  I continued with headaches in the temporal region and experienced light headedness and blurred vision throughout the day (still continues as of today 4/19/21). I went to my primary physician on 4/15/21 and was sent for labs (CBC, CMP, and TSH level), an EKG (after hearing an irregular heart rhythm), and a MRI of my brain. All of my labs and MRI were reported as normal. My EKG showed occasional PVC&#39;s.

Overnight the bump got a bit smaller and the bruise expanded. Over the next several days the bump kept diminishing. The bruise remained about the same size and kept getting darker. It?s been one week now and the bump is very tiny (size of a small pea), and the bruise is incredibly dark, but showing more of a healing process color.

As I was instructing her to remain seated, she passed out and was unresponsive.  She appeared to be having a seizure immediately after that lasted about 1 minute.  Once this episode passed, she became responsive and could talk.  EMS arrived and took over.

I also experienced tingling sensation to my scalp, face, hands, arms and legs. I also experienced an immediate muscular type pain.  I also had one episode of palpitations with pause on the vaccine of the three week window and that is what prompted to go see a doctor. I had EKG, holster monitor which my tests were normal.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included amoxicillin allergy.  The patient, age 38, received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 1805029) dose was not reported, administered on 08-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 17-MAR-2021, the patient was &#34;experiencing headaches 1 week ago&#34;, and also had aphasia later in the week.  On 24-MAR-2021, the patient went to an outside hospital and was found to have intraparenchymal hemorrhage in addition to venous sinus thrombosis and developed intracerebral haematoma.  On 25-MAR-2021, Computerized tomography (CT) of the head without contrast showed parenchymal hemorrhage and persistent hyperdensity in the left transverse sinus, consistent with known venous sinus thrombosis. The patient was being treated for the venous sinus thrombosis with heparin. On an unknown date, platelet count was 78,000 (thrombocytopenia). The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of events thrombocytopenia, intracerebral haematoma, venous sinus thrombosis, experiencing headaches 1 week ago, and computerized tomogram head abnormal was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).  Version 3 was created on 26-APR-2021 for the purpose of quality improvement. The following corrections were made: platelet count was added as the event of thrombocytopenia.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V2: Follow up added additional laboratory information. This report received via VAERs database (ID# 1133212) concerned a 38-year-old female patient who experienced intraparenchymal hemorrhage and venous sinus thrombosis 16 days after vaccination. Diagnosis was confirmed on computerized tomography (CT) of the head. Platelet count was 78,000.   Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Presenting symptoms included headache and aphasia. Treatment included heparin.  Outcome was not reported.   Based on evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS), the low platelet count and temporal relationship to vaccination (Criteria level 2), the events are assessed to have a plausible relationship with vaccination.

                                                About a week after being vaccinated I started experiencing bad headaches, chest pains and pains in my leg. I went to the emergency department at Hospital to get checked out. They took blood and I had a high d dimer test result. They did an Ultrasound of both legs, and a CT with contrast of the lungs and a CT of the head. No blood clots were evident at the time. Over the next couple of weeks my left leg has continued to swell and hold fluid. On 5-11-2021 I had another ultrasound of the left leg again to rule out a possible blood clot. Again they did not find anything. After reviewing blood work from a coag profile all results were elevated but not worrisome per the dr. I continie to have more swelling in the left lower extremity, muscle aches and pains in that leg along with more busted blood vessels. I have experienced pains in places that I have never had before. Example a sharp pain started around my left pelvic area and shot up to the left shoulder and then burned for several minutes.

There was no injury to my eye and my ophthalmologist told me it would heal in a few weeks.  Two weeks ago (beginning of May) a terrible, nearly unbearable headache began.  A few days later, I continued to feel strange and began to get more frequently short of breath and my cough worsened.  On 5/5/2021 I went to my doctor , Family Medicine, and was then sent to the local hospital, and had a cat scan done of my lungs, around 9 AM.

When I got to the hospital I could not breath my ribs hurt a lot &amp; I had horrible back pain. They put me oxygen and gave me fluids but they said I had to get transfer to another hospital and they transferred me on an ambulance. In the other hospital us where they transferred me they kept poking my stomach when I asked them why they kept poking it they told me that it was to stop the blood cloths. I was hospitalized for 5 days. When I was sent home I was still not feeling good I was feeling sick still I&#39;ve been trying to recover slowly but I am not the same. I&#39;m still in a lot of pain I can&#39;t move my arms because of how much it hurts my back keeps hurting a lot as well. I want to go back to normal to how I was I can&#39;t do anything I can&#39;t even cook for my kids. I now have depression.

Once she stabilized and identified who she was, where she was, and what had just happened, I sat her up and checked her blood pressure (113/60 at 10:12am). I stayed with the patient and continued to assess the situation and her until EMS arrived and took over care.

I had been out of my migraine medications. Rested all day. Pattern continued.  4/13 My BP had increased (200/140), racing heart, not well. I went to urgent care. They gave me migraine cocktail. I was having all over global pain and concentrated pain. Lidocaine Q-tips in nostrils as a nerve block to help with pain. The rest of the night I was ok but the next day the migraine was back. The medication was for onset of migraine but it was already there and didn&#39;t work.  4/13-4/18 migraine persisted 4/18 contacted PCM. They told me they needed to see me. I was having high BP due to the increased pain per dr. They did the same migraine treatment that day. The BP medication stayed same as they felt it was a migraine issue. They prescribed oxycodone that day. They couldn&#39;t give Toradol because I had had within 24 hours. I went home, slept and didn&#39;t work for 2 weeks.  4/18,4/21 I went to ER. Repeat of treatments for migraine. Was never fully gone when discharged.  The migraine was always there, the night of the 20th I was throwing up, 21st my eyes were twitching and shaking which was new symptoms to my migraine.  *This has triggered my history of migraines to flare up again since giving birth to my daughter 4 years ago.

It was a bad headache on left side of head. I was just not feeling well. On the 19th day, it went away. I still from time to time I do still feel pain in the head on the left side. I had a lot of tightness in my left leg. In  previous years, I have had blood clot in my leg and after birth in my stomachs - so with the pain in calf I called a doctor and went. They did a visual. After a lump appearing in my leg, an ultrasound was scheduled. I went  Urgent care on May 10 - she ordered an ultrasound but her office didn&#39;t ever follow up with me. On 17th, I saw my Primary care and she sent me straight to get an Ultrasound - on the 18th, it revealed I had a blood clot.

Given ice pack and put in chair to rest and given a drink of water. After about 15 minutes, pt now says she is feeling fine and back to normal and able to walk on her own.

                                                I have a history of anaphylaxis, and disclosed that to the medics so they watched me more carefully, which was good, as while I did not experience anything that severe, I did immediately get itchy, turn red and feel quite nauseated. However,  after they monitored me awhile, I told them I felt okay to go home. The next day I had the expected mild flu-like symptoms, which I anticipated. However, what?s been atypical is they returned tenfold three days later. This time with a much higher fever (103), severe chills, fatigue, a seemingly never-ending headache,  muscle spasms,  chest palpitations and suddenly I am experiencing asthma (which is typically seasonal) and am coughing, too.  I?m now a week past when I was vaccinated and each day was feel worse, not better. I have had to cancel my clients and hire a sitter to care for my kids as I am too weak and ill to do it.  I looked up common reactions and nothing states chest pain and/or asthma, nor that it should last this long. That said, as I am high-risk, I work from home and homeschool both of my young kids. Thus, I have been nowhere aside from the vaccine site. Moreover, my partner, our kids and sitter get routinely tested for me,  and everyone is negative. Thus, it appears I am having prolonged, heightened side-effects much more intense than the ?mild? flu-like symptoms otherwise reported, which is concerning. I took no medication prior to receiving the vaccine, either.

Couldn?t open eyes or move fingers.  Light headed...blacking out when I got up to go the bathroom.  Couldn?t have any sounds (like tv) on.  Just needed to lay still and sleep.    The above lasted 19 hours.    Then my temperature ended.  I had trouble walking and standing for another 20 hours. No stamina.   I went to work near the end of this and noticed I had trouble looking at my paperwork and figuring what to do for my job.  Not sure if this was still the fatigue just in a different way.  Then it disappeared.

I also felt like my heart was racing and I was going to pass out. I remained at the pharmacy for approx another hour, still not feeling well. EMS was called, checked my BP and heart rate, which was a little elevated. SBP 137, HR 90-low 100&#39;s. I did take some liquid benadryl while still at the pharmacy. After about an hour and a half to 2 hours, the feeling completely subsided. The symptoms began again today 4/9/21 at approx 1015am. I have taken another benadryl capsule.

When I looked over, I saw patient experiences minor convulsions. She was still in her chair. Episode lasted not even 10 seconds. Patient awoke and said she blacked out. She was coherent and responsive. We called 911. Patient said she has no history of seizures or low blood sugar. She said she tends to faint when giving blood or during vaccines due to the needle. Paramedic checked patient out and cleared the patient. No ambulance was taken. Will call patient tomorrow to follow up.

                                                After the immunization was administered to the patient, she was asked to have a seat in the waiting area for observation.  A few minutes after she sat, she told her husband who was seated with her she didn&#39;t feel well (he did not inform us).  The technician observing her noticed she passed out and reported to the pharmacist (myself).  I designated a team member to call 911 and ran out to the patient.  She was extremely pale and her lips were blue.  With the assistance of her husband I laid her on the floor, had him elevate her feet and checked for pulse and breathing.  I couldn&#39;t immediately find her pulse but within 30 seconds she began to come to.  She appeared to tremor a few times as she came to and her color began to return.  She was extremely confused and did not know where she was upon awakening.  EMS arrived on the scene approximately 10-15 minutes after the event.  They did standard patient evaluation which was unremarkable and proceeded to bring her to the local ED,  According to the patient, the ED visit yielded nothing and they said &#34;she couldn&#39;t be more healthy&#34;.  One note, that was revealed in conversation with the patient while waiting for EMS to arrive is that the patient had very little to eat or drink prior to being administered the vaccine.

                                                On March 10 (the day after my vaccine) I felt the normal body aches and had a pretty bad headache. That all went away in the evening on March 10. Since that day I have had off and on dizziness/lightheadedness. On March 19 I fainted in my kitchen. I hit my kitchen table and had a huge knot on my head and bruises all down my left side of my body. My left shoulder still hurts from the fall and I still have a small knot on my head (left side just above my left eye on my forehead). I went to my primary care doctor on  March 24 and reported the event. I asked if it could be related to the COVID vaccine and she said she wasn&#39;t sure since the Jansen one was so new, but that she had seen these effects from the other two vaccines.  At the doctor&#39;s office my blood pressure was on the lower end (110/60). My normal blood pressure runs about 118/70. They ran some blood work and that all came back normal. They did an EKG in the office, but my blood pressure stayed pretty close to the same as it was the first reading. They then sent me to get a CT scan on my head, which also came back normal. She did diagnose me with a concussion. I was out of work the entire week (March 22-March 26) due to this. She also ordered me to have an echo done. While at the office for the echo, my blood pressure ran 99/46 (this was on March 31). The results of the echo came back normal.  I also got a monitor to wear for 72 hours on March 31. I took that to the doctor on April 5 and I am still waiting on results from that.  Since the event on March 19, I have had headaches and body aches. I have also had slight lightheadedness off and on.

                                                Immediately when I received the injection, I felt a cool fluid rush around my heart with a moderate discomfort/pain. I reported this to the tech who administered. He didn&#39;t seem alarmed &amp; advised I wait 15 mins. I still felt a &#34;coolness&#34; around my chest but otherwise felt &#34;fine&#34; so I was permitted to leave. As the day went on, I felt my chest (lungs &amp; area around my heart) feel tighter &amp; tighter &amp; my breath grew more &amp; more &#34;shallow&#34; like I couldn&#39;t take deep enough breaths &amp; I was short of breath. In the evening, it intensified. I was very fatigued (couldn&#39;t go up our stairs or talk in complete sentences without feeling &#34;winded&#34;). The tightness in my chest was worse &amp; was accompanied by periodic acute pain in my heart. I also had pain my lower back. I went to the emergency room around 10PM that night. An EKG, blood tests &amp; chest X-ray were conducted. The ER doctor said all tests came back &#34;normal&#34; &amp; they weren&#39;t sure what my issue was. I went home &amp; rested. I woke the next morning with the acute pains gone but the tightness still lingered. I did not feel &#34;normal&#34; until almost 72 hours after my vaccine.

                                                Had a huge blood clot come out of my nose after a nose bleed. I do not get nose bleeds so this was very strange. Took me 15 minutes to get it to stop bleeding.

                                                Headache and very tired the night of the vaccine. At 12:30 AM that night I woke up to what felt like electric shocks going through my body (painful zaps) and in a full body sweat. No fever. I then started shaking uncontrollably and my heart rate increased to the 100s. The shaking and rapid heart rate lasted for 30 minutes. Woke up again multiple times with body sweats.  In the morning still lethargic but all symptoms resolved by noon.

                                                About 2:30pm on 4/6/2021, same day as vaccine, began to have saline/metallic taste in mouth, about 1 hour later started to get cotton mouth and began getting tired; by 5pm same day I was fatigued and had a hard time keeping my eyes open, started getting chills about 7:30pm and took 2 ibuprofen and fell asleep, woke up some time before midnight because my heart was pounding in my chest, was so tired that I&#39;m not sure if I passed out or just fell back asleep but woke up around 3:00am on 4/7/2021 with a fever and headache.  The cotton mouth, fatigue, headache and fever of 99.9 to 101 lasted until about 8:00am on 4/8/2021., where I had a second set of chills and the fever broke.  On 4/9/2021 I still had fatigue and had to leave work early as I couldn&#39;t multi-task and had a hard time staying focused.  The inability to focus and fatigue lasted 4/10/201 and 4/11/2021, just walking up and down my stairs at home exhausted me.  On 4/12/2021 I went back to work, my focus is better but still not back to where it should be, I still get exhausted easily and everything is a bit too bright.  On 4/12/2021 about 7:30am, I had a bloody nose that took a while to stop (about 30 minutes), that is not normal as I rarely have a bloody nose; I was late to work due to it and had another one while at work around 11:40am; it was not as bad as the first and stopped after approximately 10 minutes.  Today is 4/13/2021- Things are still a little too bright and my energy level is not quite back to normal, I also have a slight headache.

                                                Immediately at 15 minutes: blurry vision; felt off and felt loopy (out of it);  I was dropping food on myself as I was eating. My pupils were really small. I felt out of it. Finally I got home (son drove me). I had mild chest pains and heart racing (had this initially, too). And the chest pains and heart racing kept happening off and on through the night. I had headaches that night and I felt nauseated. Next day, I had to wear sunglasses inside my  house as I was light sensitive and my pupils remained small. I still felt body aches and nausea but the eyes were the biggest concern...shining light by my eyes didn&#39;t make my pupils bigger. The light that came off my phone aggravated my eyes and my head. Thursday, I still had nausea but headache wasn&#39;t bad with Tylenol. Those full two days all I did was sleep. Friday, I felt like things were mild and Tylenol was helping. I called heathline for my eyes. As those still weren&#39;t improving. I got into my eye doctor for an exam (4/9). There was no inflammation and he decided to dilate my eyes. Of course, my eyes were blurry and my eyes responded to that dilation. I napped after returning home. My pupils after the nap were finally responding. I still had a little light sensitivity in my eyes but not as much as I had had and pupils were doing what they should with light. So this was 3 1/2 days later. I still do get mild headache and mild chest pain - it comes and it goes. I have a doctor appt - general check up  - that was already scheduled for tomorrow and he will examine for chest pain.

Next morning, I stayed in bed and took ibuprofen and went back to sleep and 30 minutes later the fever broke. I still had body aches and headaches for two to three days. I went to get test for a concern that ended up not being a health concern at all.

                                                Within minutes of shot, on the shot going in - it stung so bad I cried and I have a high pain tolerance &gt; extreme nausea right after the shot was in; I felt short of breath - Heartrate - While standing in line, my heartrate was 75 or 76  and it went up to 130  beats per minute after the vaccine (I have a watch that tells me); my heart was racing. I was putting cold water bottles on my neck to feel better. Heartrate went from 130 to 100 at 45 minutes out. It stayed in the hundreds for a couple of hours. About three hours after shot - I developed itching and hives all over - chest, arms, and tops of thighs. I took Benadryl. The injection site on arm stayed incredibly painful - I couldn&#39;t even move my arm. 4/12/2021 - I got in contact with someone from Clinic. They felt like there had been a reaction to vaccine - advised to continue Benadryl. A localized reaction to injection site. First 48 hours  bone, muscle, joint pain was extreme - it hurt to be alive. It took a week for that to fade so I could function again. Got in contact with Dr. again 19th. Swollen oval under my skin about 2 -3 inches long at injection site; fatigue and nausea is still there. Ran some bloodwork. Advised to take Benadryl when itching came back. This morning, I called the doctor today 20th - an allergist was pulled in for this conversation as well - I was prescribed to take Zyrtec; Claritin and a prednisone (to prevent reaction from continuing) and also Zofran for the long term reaction to the vaccine. Watch the injection site for any redness and heat (there&#39;s none right now). Three days after vaccine, I did get a blistery rash across my neck at my collarbone area, down my chest and under my breast and across my rib cage on front and a little on my back on the back of my shoulders and down along the spine. Additionally there was a flat orangish rash that developed - on my face and nose. And then my skin started peeling off there and it (that flat orangish rash) showed up  also on the middle of my chest too right in the middle of the other rash on my chest. That is improving with the medications I&#39;m taking.

Saying they were flu-like symptoms is a euphemism. ---Days 2-9 I was weak and shaky on my legs, easily winded (e.g. breathing hard when doing laundry). Fever returned off and on. ---Days 4-13 It felt like someone was sitting on my chest. ---Day 10 I had a blood draw per my doctors request. ---Day 12 Blood draw results showed high d-dimer, and my doctor told me I need to go to the ER for a ct scan to look for blood clots. ---Day 12 Went to Emergency Department - ct scan showed no clots, but elevated Pro B Type Natriuretic Peptide ---Day 15 Finally started feeling better, but still winded easily, fatigued, dizziness, heart palpitations

                                                PULMONARY EMBOLISM IN CHEST; TIREDNESS; This spontaneous report received from the patient&#39;s mother concerned a 39 year old. The patient&#39;s weight was 251 pounds, and height was 66 inches. The patient&#39;s past medical history included a previous pulmonary embolism on 12-JUL-2012, which the reporter said the physician attributed to the patient being &#34;obese and lays on her bed and doesn&#39;t exercise&#34;.  Concurrent conditions included irregular menstruation, schizoaffective disorder, panic attacks, anxiety attacks, depression, incontinence, gastritis, constipation, sciatica nerve pain, asthma, obese, and doesn&#39;t comprehend well.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1802070 expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 in total administered on 06-MAR-2021 at left arm for prophylactic vaccination. Non-Company suspect included ethinylestradiol/ferrous fumarate/norethisterone acetate, &#34;for two months&#34; for irregular menstruation.  On 17-MAR-2021, the patient&#39;s physician ordered the patient to stop taking.  Concomitant medications included salbutamol, lactulose for constipation, clozapine, gabapentin (noted as the doctor was trying to wean patient off medication), oxybutynin hydrochloride, pantoprazole, risperidone, valproate semisodium, vilazodone hydrochloride, and unspecified breathing treatments. In MAR-2021, the patient&#39;s mother stated that the first few days after vaccination the patient was fine. After a few days, patient was more tired than usual. On 16-MAR-2021, the patients mother noticed the patient&#39;s right leg was swollen and decided to take the patient to the Emergency Room. She was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism in the chest verified with radiology tests of chest and many other tests. Treatment included Eliquis 5 mg 2 times a day to treat the pulmonary embolism in her chest.   The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of pulmonary embolism in chest was not reported.  The patient had not recovered from tiredness.   This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 39-year-old obese (BMI 40.5 kg/m2) female patient was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism 10 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  Concurrent conditions includes  irregular menstruation, schizoaffective disorder, panic attacks, anxiety attacks, depression, incontinence, gastritis, constipation, sciatica nerve pain, asthma, obese, difficulty in comprehension.  Concurrent medications includes ethinylestradiol/ferrous fumarate/norethisterone acetate, salbutamol, lactulose, clozapine, gabapentin, oxybutynin hydrochloride, pantoprazole, risperidone, valproate semisodium, vilazodone hydrochloride, and unspecified breathing treatments.  There was prior history of pulmonary embolism (PE) 9 years prior to vaccination and was advised to be due to obesity and lack of physical activity.  Emergency room consult for leg swelling 10 days after vaccination; diagnosed with PE with radiology and many other unspecified tests; treated with Eliquis.  Th event is confounded by increased risk with prior history of pulmonary embolism, obesity, OCP, and risperidone (class effect).  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

                                                Sudden onset of menstrual period, lasting 2 weeks with extremely heavy flow and pain.  Saw my Dr. and she did a blood test to check for platelet count, which all labs done were normal. Period lasting from 4/7 to 4/21 all the while I take my birth control as normal with no missed doses. Now on 5/7 having severely heavy flow again with clotting. Dr. prescribed naproxen and an extra &#34;mini-pill&#34; hormone supplement on top of my regular birth control. Will monitor.

                                                I experienced after my J&amp;J vaccine at about 8pm, felt very fatigued with pain at the injection site, felt like drunk feeling which lasted one week. The main thing is that I slept a lot and was unable to work which lasted 9 days. The thing that I went to urgent care for pelvic pain, body aches and pain, developed an UTI and my symptoms cleared at home with medications.  At the urgent care lab work and urine culture was performed. When I went to the urgent care they said I also had tachycardia.  My symptoms have resolved.

She stayed sitting in the vaccination/observation area for 10 more minutes. She was at the store for approximately 45 mins and waited 30 min after shot

                                                The day before she got her vaccine she had started her menstruation cycle.  She is not on any medications, everything was normal, went to work and went to get her vaccine.  She got her vaccine and around 4:15 she started gushing, which is abnormal for her and having clots the size of a half dollar and covered in blood.  This is not normal for her periods, and she is now in the bathroom every hour and a half and looks like a murder scene.  Her normal menstrual cycle is heavy for one day and then gradually lessens and only lasts a few days.   She does occasionally have small clots with hers, but this are large and bleeding profusely.  The only side effect she has is that she is extremely tired.  She slept from 4:30 yesterday to 2:00 AM and feels like she could sleep the rest of the day.   Her arm is a little bit sore, but otherwise fine from the injection site.  Is concerned due to the heavy volume of bleeding, which is extremely abnormal for her.   She has taken Tylenol and drinking a lot of fluids.

On 5/1 I developed severe chest pains again so I went so I went to another Hospital and was informed that my D-Dimer was elevated  and was transferred to a different hospital where I was monitored for 24hrs and was released.  I visited the Cardiologist who performed a Stress test which was abnormal so I have another Stress Echo tomorrow but I have never had any heart issues in the past.

                                                When I woke up, I was awake for an hour and a half and I started feeling faint and felt like I had the flu. My stomach started hurting so I took a nap. I woke up with a severe headache. My resting heart rate went up into the 100&#39;s. I had a knot on top of my forehead, like a swollen area. It lasted for a few days. My feet and fingers started turning blue. I am still experiencing fatigue, feeling lethargic and my resting heart rate is still high. I have received medicine from my Cardiologist.

I had a rash on my shoulders, ankles and forearms. It was little spots about six inches. Those symptoms lasted for 36 hours. After that point I had very low Oxygen levels and my Asthma was very severe. My Nebulizer and rescue inhaler were not very effective. It has been almost nine weeks and my Oxygen levels are still lower than normal at 96 or 97.  Before the vaccine my Asthma was controlled and I rarely used the rescue inhaler. I use my rescue inhaler once daily. I am using my Nebulizer once daily. Immediately after the vaccine I was using my Nebulizer four times daily. It is still not near the level of control I had before the vaccine.

Her husband was with her and helped us lower her to the ground. We utilized a cold compress and elevated her feet. She came to and began feeling much better after approximately 5 - 10 minutes post vaccination. We held her to watch her an additional 15 minutes afterwards.  Patient was able to walk to her car and did not feel she needed additional assistance.

                                                So on approximately 5/6/2021 I started having some pain, discomfort and vertigo - tightness in my chest and what not. Then I could not see out of my right eye when I went to sleep as well. Then I was having some balancing issues too, I went to the ER on the 6th of May and then the 10th of May as well. I called my DR because I was having headaches and the other issues as well, he told me to go to the ER. The ER did some tests and ruled out neurological issues. My PCD told me it was probably a complex migraine, a reaction from the vaccine. He gave me medication for five days -methylprednisolone 4MG. I went to the eye DR as well and they documented my right eye lack of vision. The eye DR told me to hold off about a month before getting any glasses or anything like that. After four weeks, my vision was doing better and the balance and other things they were better but not my normal. I went to the eye DR again after that time frame and they said my vision had returned. I do not know when everything as a whole went back to normal, but I do feel fine now.
