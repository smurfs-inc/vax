As the day has gone on the dizziness has gotten worse. At times it feels like I?m going to faint. (I haven?t yet fainted)  I have not tried any treatment yet hoping it doesn?t last longer then today.

Muscles began tensing up, tunnel vision started, extreme dizziness, vomiting, severe weakness in muscles, and fainting. These lasted for about 2 hours before decreasing in severity but continued to be present until about 10:30pm, 13 and a half hours after receiving the shot. Nothing was done to treat the symptoms. As of 12:30pm on 3/10, some minor symptoms are still present, such as muscle weakness and pain, severe migraine, and dizziness.

I also was experiencing a heavy chest and shortness of breath. All but one of the adverse events went away after 24-36 hours - the shortness of breath and shallow breathing have persisted up through today. I am very aware of my breathing and how my chest feels tight, like I&#39;m not getting enough air.

                                                I started to feel tired once I got the shot, I got the shot at around 1:15 pm. About 5 pm, I started to feel really cold and my whole body was shivering and vibrating. My whole body also started to ache and my bones felt heavy. At about 10 pm I started to get really high fever and felt so cold. I could not sleep even with a winter jacket on, I had a really bad headache in the center of my forehead, lower back pain and felt extremely sore and weak. I found it difficult to stand or walk. I woke up at 2:30 am from bed, to get a snack and took 2 ibuprofen to ease the symptoms. Woke up at about 10 am next day, felt slightly better. Fever has gone down slightly but not completely. Still feeling really cold and shivering.

                                                Patient was administered vaccine and told to wait the 15 minute monitoring period. After about 4 minutes, I heard her say &#34;I&#39;m not feeling right.&#34; I went to where she was sitting and asked &#34;are you ok?&#34; and had her take some slow, deep breaths. I then saw her eyes roll back and she lost consciousness. Thankfully, I was there and grabbed her as she toppled from the chair. I told the staff to call 911 and supported her neck and body in the chair. I could tell she was breathing and she was sweating profusely. I held her and spoke to her, and after about 15 seconds, she began to come out of it. After about a minute she was alert and orientated again.  I had her slowly sip a little water. The EMTs arrived in about 5 minutes and the assessed her vitals. She indicated that this was the first time anything like this had happened to her. They advised that since she had fainted, she should go to the hospital for observation, but she declined, stated that she felt fine at that point. Since she was driving, I insisted that she remain another one-half hour before leaving. During that time she drank more water and alternately sat and walked around the pharmacy. She did indicate that she had drank a protein shake that morning, but not eaten. I advised her to in the future, tell her doctor and/or any immunizer about the event. She left, stating that she was feeling fine, and I called her several hours later to make sure that she had indeed gotten home ok. She again said that she felt fine.

But I&#39;m type 1 diabetic and my blood sugars have been at dangerously high levels for 3-4 days now. They still haven&#39;t gone down. I&#39;ve been taking two times as much long acting insulin as I usually take, tripling the amount of fast acting insulin I usually take, and am only eating protein and vegetables (no carbs) to try to keep my sugars in normal range, and even then they are stubbornly sticking around 250  to 400. I want doctors and patients to be aware of this side effect because it was really scary for me and it still hasn&#39;t resolved itself.

I woke up at 11:55p (8 hours post vaccine, two hours after falling asleep) due to full body chills and shaking. I took two Tylenol. This lasted about 45 minutes. I felt cold but didn?t have a fever.  I kept waking up throughout the night clammy.  I woke up at 5:30a (30 mins earlier than normal) because I couldn?t sleep and had a headache.  I felt sore and achy and very fatigued all day. I took the afternoon off work and came home and slept 3 hours. Still felt groggy and sore after. Felt more normal the next morning. My left arm is still sore two days post vaccination.

I had to go home from work due to these feelings. Eventually, developed into a fever. I went home and the chills and aches worsened. I could not get warm not matter how many layers or blankets I had. I took tylenol and fell asleep after several hours. When I woke up, I was profusely sweaty, my fever  broke. I was able to eat a small lunch and continued to lie down the whole day. My symptoms lessened and were more minimal 24 hours after. After going to sleep the second night, I felt back to normal upon wake up.

                                                I noticed a very mild headache and slight coldness within 2 hours of my vaccine.  Onset of my severe symptoms began around 10PM on 03/12/2021 with a stabbing headache (Felt like someone took an air pump and kept &#39;blowing up&#39; my head. My eyes felt achy and heavy and every time I looked in a different direction I would get a zapping/electric feeling throughout my head that would cause my head and neck to spasm (longer duration) or twitch (quick jolt). This also caused dizziness). I got really cold and had intense shivering and shaking. Around midnight, my skin started feeling bruised all over my body (very sensitive to touch, including my bed sheets against my spine felt like rubbing up against a wound). At the same time, my joints (especially my neck, hips, and knees) got hot to the touch and were incredibly painful (induced tears). My muscles developed a deep ache that also caused significant pain. I felt very weak and confused. I didn&#39;t take my temperature until the early morning, and it was 102.9 at that time. I alternated taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen throughout the day, but my temperature stayed between 102 and 103.1 for about 24 hours, as did the previously noted symptoms.   I noticed a gradual improvement of my symptoms over the next two days. On the evening of 03/14/2021, my headache worsened some, and I had an unexpected episode where I nearly passed out (dropped to the floor but stayed conscious). I also had intermittent foot tingling (very noticeable, not mild) over the course of a few hours.   For 3 full days (but by far the most severe within the first 24 hours), I experienced some strange sound processing. Things like the sound of a car driving by or the ceiling fan felt like it echoed throughout my whole body and gave me an uncomfortable shivering feeling.   As of today (03/16/2021), I am mostly recovered. I am still experiencing fatigue, a very mild headache, and some mild pain. My nausea has completely resolved, though that was never a chief complaint of mine.   I realize that some of my symptoms are to be expected with this vaccine. But especially the level of pain I experienced throughout my entire body was very concerning and not something that I was aware could happen as a result of the vaccine.

My muscles were very achey, and my heart was racing. I was slightly nauseous but still able to eat a little. By 24 hours after the shot my fever was down to 99f.  I started to get diarrhea beginning the second day and has lasted until now the third day after vaccination day.

It felt like I could not get warm no matter how many extra blankets I added. This soon led to a fever. I was in an out of sleep for the next few hours and woke up around 2:30 AM. At that point the fever had broken and I was sweating. I still had body aches, which I think was due to my body being tensed up for some many hours, and I had a splitting headache, as well. At around 4:30 AM, I woke up again, with a very sore arm a terrible headache still. I got up and took 400 mg of Ibuprofen and went back to sleep. At 7 AM my alarm went off and all adverse effects seemed to be gone other than a sore arm. The sore arm last for about 6 days.

I did notice my Raynaud?s symptoms became way worse.  At about 5:30pm I started to feel extremely cold. By 6pm I was having horrible pains and spasms in my lower back and hips. My muscles and joints became very stiff. This moved to my neck/shoulders, and down my thighs. I lost feeling in my feet and started struggling to be able to take in a full breath. I felt like my whole body was locked up. I started feeling nauseous, but part of that may have been from the nerves. The next morning I felt a bit more mobile but still nauseous and stiff. I have slowly gotten better throughout the day, but am still stiff and exhausted

My husband stacked 10&#43; blankets on top of me trying to get me to warm up.  I was running a fever of 103, and my heart rate was at 104 all night long.  My fever didn&#39;t break until shortly before 8:00 a.m. on Monday, March 15, 2021 but my heart rate stayed between 95 - 102 most of the day.  The body aches weren&#39;t too terrible, but I did have those.  I have bruising, puffiness, and swelling at the injection site.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Received the shot at 11 am and started feeling tired with some muscle aches at 2:45 pm. I slept from 3:45 to 4:30 pm but was still tired and felt weak. I did feel hungry and made dinner over 30 minutes. However, this wore me out. I was even more tired and started getting dizzy. I almost fainted as I made my way to a chair to sit down. I couldn&#39;t eat because of slight nausea and cold chills. I was shaking for about 20 minutes. Eventually, I made it to my bed to lay down, but my legs were shaking as I walked up the stairs. At 6:00 pm, my temperature was 98.8 F. I was freezing a shivering for the next hour in bed under 3 blankets. My hands and feet felt like ice. At 8:00 pm, I had a fever of 100.2  F that lasted all night. My body ached all over, especially at the hips. I couldn&#39;t sit still and couldn&#39;t sleep until 4:00 am. I woke at 8:30 am with some milder aches and fatigue with a temperature of 97.6 F.

She received her first COVID vaccine 8 hours prior. No cough. She felt well before the shot. No bleeding or leaking fluid. Her COVID test was negative. She was tachycardic to the 140&#39;s and the baby was tachycardiac to the 180&#39;s starting at presentation. She was treated with oral tylenol and IV fluids. After about 90 minutes of monitoring a prolonged fetal heart rate deceleration was noted to the 60&#39;s for 6 minutes. This recovered with repositioning. After another hour a reactive tracing was noted with a normal heartrate for baby. In induction of labor was started.

About 5 minutes in, I started to become dizzy, my vision started blacking out, my hearing was muffled, I became clammy, sweaty, and experienced mental disorientation. It became harder for me to breathe, but I never struggled to take a breath. I drank some water and waited for the symptoms to subside. I remained seated and these symptoms went away within 5 minutes. After feeling better for about 5 minutes, I felt cold and was shivering. The woman sitting next to me was completely fine after her shot. I&#39;ve since felt a slight burning sensation on my skin in areas that I have scratched lightly. I&#39;m also experiencing strange feelings throughout my body- specifically my head, leg, and hand. It feels like I can feel something in each area for a bit and then it subsides after several minutes.

It was like an asthma attack, but normally my asthma attacks are caused by a sinus infection. This was just shortness of breath and gasping for air.  I used my rescue inhaler with increasing frequency over the course of the following week. By March 12, I had to use my nebulizer. I used the nebulizer once on March 12, twice on March 13, twice on March 14, and I finally went to urgent care on March 15 when the nebulizer stopped helping. Urgent care was unable to help due to covid protocols, so they put me on oxygen for 5 minutes and transferred me to the ER.  At the ER, by the time I got to the ER, my breathing had normalized. I was given prednisone on site, as well as a prescription for 5 days. I had a chest xray done that returned completely normal.

                                                At the time of injection, it was pretty painful and thus sent my body into a shock less than 5 mins after receiving my dose. My vision went white and I was very light-headed and hot/sweaty.  A nurse came with me outside to monitor and I was feeling back to normal in 15 minutes. This is something that happens when I experience a high amount of pain, so just reporting for others who maybe have low blood pressure issues.  At about 8pm, other side effects started to set in. I first experienced a headache, then experienced soreness/ache-y-ness  in my back. Around 8:30, I started to feel light headed again and soon my whole body felt ache-y. I quickly developed chills where I felt so cold that I was uncontrollably shaking and felt very sore/stiff. I have been laying under a heated blanket for the last hour and a half and am finally feeling better with no more shaking  or chills. I still have soreness throughout my body and a headache, but I took ibuprofen around 8:30pm.

                                                Vasovagal syncope a few minutes after vaccination.   Fever of 101.8F 24h after vaccination (3/10/2021). Fever is continuing today (3/11/2021), but is lower at 100.4F. Tingling fingers on hand from vaccination arm (left), swelling from vaccination injection site, headache, and neck pain all developed on 3/10/2021.  Headache and neck pain could be due to head trauma from vasovagal syncope. Tingling fingers were not observed on 3/11/2021.    *I have had vasovagal syncope in the past, but never with vaccines. It always occurs when I see my own blood.

                                                Around 8 hours after the shot I started to experience fatigue, body aches, uncontrollable body shakes, blueish lips and sweating (which to me indicated I had a fever). After taking some Advil my lips returned to normal and the body shakes stopped although it was hard to regulate my body temperature. I was sweating but felt cold. The worst of the symptoms seemed to last around 13 hours after they had started (so about 7pm on 3/25 to about 8am on 3/26). It&#39;s now been around 30 hours and I&#39;m feeling better but still fatigued and have soreness in my left arm where I received the injection.

By 4pm I had a headache, body aches, upset stomach, tired, fever, and chills. My fever would go up and down, highest was 103.2 reached that temp 3 times. By 2am my mother drove me to the ER. I was diagnosed with a migraine and was given IV fluids and an IV migraine cocktail. After receiving the fluids and meds I felt much better and was released back home.

A few minutes later she fainted and fell out of the chair onto the floor. We helped her up to a sitting position and gave her a bottle of water and an ice pack.  The right side of her forehead appeared red from apparent hit on the floor when she fainted.  We had her wait on the floor for about 30 minutes to ensure she remained conscious.  Patient reported an ache on her forehead at site of hit.  She was also sweating and reported feeling hot. Patient had a partner with her who agreed to escort her to an urgent care clinic in the same building as the pharmacy. Store manager in charge took the patient to the urgent care clinic by wheelchair to be examined.

                                                Approximately 10 hours after injection I became tachycardic--on average experienced a heart rate of 100-120 bpm (resting hearting rate is 65-70 bpm) which continued for 6 hours.  This occurred at the same time as fever (highest 99.4 degrees F) and muscular aches in back and legs. After consulting with doctor, I took a combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen and  half a dose of  metoprolol to lower fever and heart rate.  Experienced a slight headache and had trouble sleeping due to tachycardia.  Tachycardia dissipated 6 hours after onset. All symptoms resolved by 12 PM the next day (approximately 24 hours after injection).

Concerned my bone was hit with a too long vaccine needle. Had chills/fever evening of 4/4/2021 into morning of 4/6/2021?had to take off work. Have had neurological symptoms ongoing with ?brain fogginess? since 4/5/2021. On 4/6/2021, began to see flashes/spots of light in vision of left eye, which worsened through today. Took off afternoon from work and went to an eye clinic to have eye dilated and looked at, but the spots in vision continue through reporting time (4/7/2021, 5pm CT).

                                                A few minutes after receiving the shot I began to feel nauseous, almost like being car sick while looking at my phone. I also began to feel tightness in my chest. After my 15 minutes were up I asked the administrator of my shot if it was normal that I felt dizzy/chest tightness. They said it was probably fine and just to monitor my  symptoms. I went and sat in my car a few min and I began to feel very strange, it seemed very bright out, I felt weak, and my eyes felt very heavy. I wanted to get home so I started driving but on the highway, my heart beat was very fast and I began to feel like I couldn&#39;t swallow. At one point felt as though I might be about to choke so I pulled over because I thought I was going to have to dial 911 as my throat was feeling like it was closing up. I tried swallowing a few times with great effort and after a few minutes the sensation started to lessen. My throat hadn&#39;t closed up completely, however it did feel like it had swelled up.

My arm was sore for the entire evening. I woke up around 2am Saturday morning and became dizzy. I fell to the floor and passed out for a short period of time. When I woke, I was extremely nauseous to the point of nearly vomiting. I had chills and fever. I could hardly move due to weakness - I needed help getting back into bed. When I woke the next morning, I had 100.3 fever, I had a headache and my entire body was sore. My fever went away late Saturday afternoon, but I still felt mildly nauseous. It is Monday and I still have mild nausea and light-headedness. My arm is only slightly sore.

I woke up at 12:25a.m (Sunday March 7th, 2021) with a fever of 104.3 and was experiencing extreme neck and head pain. My hands hurt as if I had arthritis and couldn&#39;t make them feel better. I was very short of breath and dry coughing. I took Tylenol and tried to lay back down and was able to go back to sleep around 3:00a.m. I got up at 6:10am and my temp was 101.6. I took Ibuprofen at this point and by 9:30am my temp was 99.8. I was still experiencing a very bad headache and my neck and back were achy. I felt a lot better by about 11:00am, took a hot shower and laid down for a nap around 2:00pm Sunday. When I woke up around 3:15p.m I had spiked yet another fever of 102.0 and was having bad body aches again in my neck and head area and it continued to get worse though my back over the next hour. I was experiencing a dry cough again also but this time it was more constant. It took over 3 hours for my fever to go below 100.0 with alternating Tylenol and Ibuprofen. It finally broke around 7:00p.m. I had a lot of pain in my neck and head the rest of the night. I woke up Monday March 8th, 2021 with a moderate headache but it went away throughout the day. No fever returned Monday. The only time I experienced coughing and shortness of breath was while I had the fever.

I went to her aid and monitored her until the paramedics showed up.  She was unconscious for a 10-15 seconds with her eyes open before regaining consciousness.  IShe was not having breathing problems or other symptoms of anaphylaxis so i did not administer an epi-pen or benadryl to her.  I rolled her on her side in case she became nauseas.  Then the paramedics arrived and attended to her.

                                                I am currently pregnant. This is my first pregnancy.  My due date is August 29, 2021.  My pregnancy has thus far been really easy with no complications.  I had a low grade fever that I took Tylenol to treat.  I had pretty bad muscle and joint pain, chills, and could not stop shaking.  I just felt freezing.  Once my fever broke I felt extremely hot all night.  The next morning I was exhausted and had a lot of the muscle and joint pain still.  I marked on my report that it would&#39;ve stopped me from going about my normal daily activities, as I could not have gone to work and spent most of the day resting.  For the next few days I was tired and my eyes ached.  On Monday and Tuesday I had a headache in the afternoon.  Yesterday afternoon my eyes finally stopped aching and everything seems to be back to normal.

                                                After being administered the vaccine at 7:12 am, when the nurse stood me up and started to walk me to the holding area, I became dizzy, my legs got weak, and there was a loud ringing in my ears. I nearly collapsed as I reached the seat in the holding area they were taking me to. I placed one 0.5MG tablet of my prescription Alprazolam in my mouth and waited for the nurse to bring water. They took me via wheelchair from the holding area to a secluded spot behind a curtain. There, I laid on a cot, received cold water, and a nurse talked to me while I recovered. It felt like I was having an anxiety attack, which has never happened to me after getting a shot before. Fitbit heart rate data shows my heart rate at 105 BPM at 7:00 am (going through the admission process, walking around the facility), 83 BPM at 7:10 am, 79 BPM at 7:15 am, 74 BPM at 7:20 am. Between 8:15 am and 1:25 pm, my heart rate remained between 63 and 89 BPM. My arm was sore and my skin hurt (an issue that I have when I feel very stressed). Additional symptoms arose around 1:35 pm. I began going through cycles of chills, sweating and overheating. My heart rate ranged from 127 BPM and 93 BPM for the remainder of the night. I took Tylenol at 7:07 PM to help with my fever.

I woke up to my husband holding my head and yelling my name. I had been seizing and had bitten my tongue. I was very white and nauseous and cold and shaky. They gave me water and a cold pack. The seizure probably only lasted for 5 seconds but it&#39;s hard to say. I felt very fatigued afterwards. I stayed for 10 more min and drank water and then they sent me on my way.

                                                Within 2 hours I was dizzy, nausea an light headed. Within 4 hours I had a fever (uncontrollable), I laid down. I wasn&#39;t able to get up and my arm swelled up really bad.  I was having streak in my vison and really bad dey eyes and mouth.  I had a fever on going for about 3 weeks straight. I called my Doctor the following day and she said it was a normal reaction, if it get&#39;s worse to call her again. I called her again because it got worse, my neck got swollen. left arm was trembling, lymph nodes were swollen, leg leg was pulsating. I started having chills and hot flashes ( I still have some till this day). My Doctor recommended seeing a specialist- Neurologist, Infectious Disease Dr.  The Neurologist said he can see where I get the trembles but does not  want to put me on medication and see if it goes away on it&#39;s own. I have a follow up with him regarding trembles, headache, flashing in my eyes. The Infectious Disease Dr. I&#39;m following up her her again regarding my arm swelling, they prescribed me steroids but had not gone down.  Since all of this I have been very fatigue, this is everyday.

After the immunization she was seated in the waiting area to be observed for 30 minutes after her vaccine. Approx. 5 mins after the vaccine was given, the patient passed out in the chair and I (the pharmacist) was alerted. The patient came back to when I arrived at her seat and was able to talk and asked for water. Her husband stayed by her side while I went to obtain water and I heard her husband say she passed out again and then regained consciousness. He layed her on the floor while I called 911. An ambulance came and took the patient to the hospital.

Shortness of breath started the next day on Sunday , extreme, far beyond normal asthma or any asthma attack. Went to urgent care on Tuesday- they said it was likely a side effect of j &amp;J and tested me for COVID, kidney disease other things, all came back negtative. Apparently I wasn?t the first person they had seen with shortness of breath. Blood in cough and spit on Wednesday after 2.5 days of  shortness of breath. Dizziness (extreme) throughout and chest pain, sternum hurt, chest tightness. Went to Er. They ran a lot of tests and they too said they had seen others with shortness of breath from j and j. They ruled out many things like pneumonia, a birth control blood clot, any lung diseases with X-rays and blood tests. I was given torkeril to ease the chest pain and tightness which it did. Blood stopped coming up in tissues. Doctor said likely inflammatory reaction to the vaccine in lungs, (I have a piece of paper proving that) and cartilage and sternum., which hurt extremely when he touched it. Blood was likely from burst capillaries from overcompensation from trying to breathe. Recommended I return if more blood came up, which it hasn?t.  Shortness of breath has not subsided. I can?t even hold a phone app without being winded. So email back, don?t call.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. Mid Saturday night I woke up to chills and was shaking so bad I couldn&#39;t fall back asleep even after adding another layer of clothes and blanket. Sunday morning I was still very cold and tired from not sleeping. I developed body aches but they were everywhere not just my arm. I was very fatigued and didn&#39;t have an appetite. The worst part was getting a migraine with extreme light sensitivity. I couldn&#39;t stand to be around any windows without blinds. I spent the day in my bedroom sleeping with the curtains closed and an eye mask on. By that night, the migraine had subsided but I was adding hot flashes to the problem list. Had a pretty restless night again on Sunday. Woke up Monday to the light sensitivity back but not as severe. I took the day off work because I couldn&#39;t handle looking at a computer screen all day. By about 1pm I was feeling mostly back to normal. My arm is still sore near the injection site and I&#39;m a bit fatigued at times but those are the only things remaining.

                                                I?ve never had an allergic reaction to anything before.  Received the vaccine at around 9:55am on 03/08/21.  Pain while the vaccine was being administered but it healed within a few minutes. I started getting a mild headache at around 3:30pm while at work. When I got home at around 6pm I started having severe chills, the headache became intense, my mouth and eyelids felt hot, my hands and feet felt very cold and when I checked temperature it was 102.4.  By 9:00 pm the headache became excruciating like I?ve never had it before, as if my head was being squeezed or pressed. Eyes and the back of my jaw hurt too.  Had light and sound sensitivity. Took 200mg of Advil but pain was still almost intolerable until I was finally able to fall asleep at around 4:00 am.  Was still in pain the day after but not as bad as the night before. Only mild pain today but started feeling itchy tonight and noticed some rashes on my body.

                                                Felt fantastic until 7 hours after the shot at 5pm on 3/13/21. Then body aches began followed by fever (100.7 taken by ear) and then headache. Headache and body aches became intense by 6:20pm on the day I received the vaccine. I took Tylenol Extra strength which helped the body aches and lowered the fever a bit but did little for the headache. Chills started around 10pm accompanied by vomiting and severe diarrhea at 1am. Blood pressure spiked at 142/101 shortly after third vomiting episode. Called family to take me to ER but didn?t end up going because I was able to get vomiting and blood pressure under control by 3am. Figured doctors would just hook me up to an IV of fluids and send me on my way anyway, not something I can afford. No more fever or chills since 4am on 3/14/21. Headache and diarrhea and slight nausea still persisting 29 hours after the shot. Treating symptoms with Tylenol, water, pedialyte, chicken broth, and toast diet. Unable to care for my children, worst I?ve felt in years. Regularly get the flu shot with no side effects.

Chills lasted for hours and couldn&#39;t stop shaking, so took Tylenol at 12:15am. Around 1:00am the chills subsided. Around 2:00am fever burnt off, sweating and hot. Couldn&#39;t sleep the rest of the night. Slept from 8am-10am and woke with just headache. Took Tylenol around 10:30am to help with headache and it did start to subside. Was mostly fatigued and muscle aches the rest of the day until 6pm when I started to get cold again. Feels like the fever and chills are coming back and it&#39;s currently 7:30pm, so assuming it&#39;ll be another night of this.

If I get worse he advised me to go to the ER and if im not feeling better to call him in three days.

On that moment I lost consciousness and passed out. In my opinion, I experimented a down on sugar, which had never happened before. My husband was able to catch me and sat me on the floor. A minute after I recovered and my husband gave me fruit (Melon) to raise my blood sugar. On that moment I had lots of nauseas and diarrhea. I was feeling weak and dizzy all night and the next day. Today Wednesday March the 17 I have been feeling much better.

                                                I was fine from 10am until 3:30pm on the day of injection. I started to feel feverish and chills at 3:30 and it progressed into a 99.2 fever with all over body aches and a headache and chills. I took alkasletzer cold medicine with Tylenol in it to help with the fever. It got the symptoms down where I could move and stood in the hot shower for 30 minutes to help warm me up. I felt slightly better and still had fever symptoms and severe body aches. I started feeling unable to move due to the fever symptoms again around 9pm and took 2 extra strength Tylenol that eventually worked and I had some nausea with that. I hadn?t been able to eat because of the symptoms and the nausea could have been from taking meds on an empty stomach. I finally felt able to eat around 10pm and had some food and went to bed. I could barley sleep all night and was tossing and turning due to fever. My nose started to get runny around 10pm before I went to bed. I woke up the next day and still had the fever symptoms, body aches and the worst headache I have ever had, a 10 on the pain scale. I took another 2 extra strength Tylenol and went to sleep for 2 hours. I woke up and could tell the fever had broken and my head was still in pretty severe pain- about a 7 on the pain scale.  I was incredibly fatigued the entire day and felt hot and cold throughout the day. I was incredibly weak and needed a lot of rest. I still didn?t sleep well through the night and woke up friday feeling fatigued. I expended some energy in the am at the dog park and had to sleep for 3 hours during the day which is atypical for me. I woke up Saturday morning (today) still feeling a headache and exhaustion. I will see how the rest of the day goes and am hoping to feel better and don?t know when the symptoms will stop.

                                                Most websites said 1-2 days for side effects to kick in but I was rocked pretty hard within the first 12 hours. The biggest symptoms I had were severe body aches, debilitating chills, fluctuating fever, headache, and no appetite.  4/1/21: * 11:15am: Vaccine administered * 12pm-6pm: Arm soreness, feeling cold/experiencing some chills, minor headache and stomach ache (I felt a little off but couldn?t tell if it was real or in my head) * 5:30pm: I walk home from work, which takes about about 35 minutes. Regret the decision about 10 mins from home due to onset body aches and fatigue  * 6pm: I go straight to bed freezing with crippling chills, body aches, and a headache * 8pm: Extreme nausea kicks in, I take Advil and cannot stomach more than one bite of food; still experiencing chills and body pain * 9pm: 100.7 fever, the chills subside and I start to get hot * 10:15pm: I finally eat some food, drink more water, body still aches, start to get chilly again  * 10:45pm: My fever is down to 99.3, my ears really hurt, like, ear-infection-style pain  * 11:15pm: 12ish hours post-vaccine, I have severe body aches, I alternate between really hot and cold, take more Advil and go to bed (finally fall asleep at midnight)  4/2/21: * 6:15am: Wake up; I spent the night tossing and turning with extreme night sweats. At this point I still have a pretty bad headache and painful body aches, specifically in my lower back and legs; fall back asleep * 8am-9am: Wake up and take more Advil. My whole body hurts. Toss and turn for a bit more. Small fever?99 degree temperature. Make coffee but have absolutely no appetite. * 9am-10am: So sweaty, fever is fully breaking * 11am: No more fever, slight headache, and body aches seem to be subsiding * 11:45am: Almost exactly 24 hours later and feeling good, comparatively speaking. Finally eat a bagel * 5:30pm: After lunch, I took a nap. My body aches have completely subsided, no fever. I still have a small headache and my ears still ache. But overall, I feel pretty normal! Just a little tired but probably from lack of sleep last night.

This lasted until approximately 07:30 on 04 Apr 2021. Upon waking I continue to experience low grade temperature around 100.4, moderate headache, joint and muscle pain, moderate fatigue and nausea.

I have also taken meloxicam QD in addition to my rescue inhaler Xopenex and Zofran ODT for nausea.

I had her sit down and told her I was giving her an Epinephrine 0.3mg shot.  The shot was given in her left thigh and within a minute her throat cleared. I gave her a bottle of water. She said her heart was racing but it eventually slowed down.  I asked her if she wanted me to call 911, she felt it was not necessary.  Patient sat in our waiting room &amp;  checked in on her every few minutes, her symptoms improved.  Patient was here over 45 minutes.  She wanted to go &amp; felt fine.  I told her to call us or go to the emergency room if any problems arise.

                                                Around 3:00pm on 3/7/21 I began to feel a little tired. But 3:45pm I was experiencing muscle pain through my body at only continued to get worse. At 4:30pm I took 400mg of ibuprofen since sitting, walking, and lying down were all painful. Relief came around 5:30pm and I was able to nap for an hour. At 6:30pm I awoke and attempted to eat, as I was beginning to feel nauseous. At 8:30pm I laid down again, my symptoms returning and worsening. I was now experiencing chills with my muscle pain and a headache. Pain was located throughout my body and my skin was sensitive to the touch. At 10:30pm I began shaking violently and struggled to feel warm, despite my skill feeling hot. My temperature was not taken. Another 400mg of ibuprofen was taken and one 350mg chewable of Tums anti-acid was eaten. It was not until 12:30am that I was able to sleep again.  The morning of 3/8/21 I was still fatigued and sore. Moving was difficult and painful and nausea was still present, and my headache returned. I was unable to eat despite trying. At 10:00am I took two tablets of Excedrin Migrain and napped for almost two hours. Currently, my muscle aches are minimal and my headache has improved. This may however be due to the medication.

I delayed taking Ibuprofen to not reduce the efficiency of the vaccine but couldn&#39;t endure the chills and shivering as well as the massive pain all over my body. I started with 200 mg Ibuprofen, which helped with all 3 symptoms at least as far as I was able to sit instead of lie all the time.

It then spread to back, other arm, legs, neck , ankles and knees. Took Benadryl and Zyrtec by doctors orders. The rash went away- but then six hours later returned and has grown. I also have to take more Benadryl since the same amount has not helped the rash disappear.

                                                Yesterday I got the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. I was the last appointment, so they observed me for 5 minutes, and I left. After riding in the car for a few minutes, I noticed that I was having a hard time breathing and my throat felt like it was starting to swell. By that time, the clinic was closed, so I went to the emergency room just in case and sat in my car since they didn&#39;t allow people to sit in the waiting room because if covid.  It started becoming increasingly difficult to breathe, and I was feeling more and more swelling of my throat and tongue. I was having a lot of dizziness, nausea, facial flushing, palpitations, and some mild confusion. I then started getting numbness in the bottom half of my face. Over time, the numbness spread, mostly staying on the left side of my body (face, scalp, lower arms and legs, left side on tongue and inside of mouth). I also started getting a prickling burning pain sensation for brief periods of time where I had numbness. I had decided that if my breathing worsened at all, I would go to the er even though I can&#39;t afford it.   After about an hour and a half, my breathing started to feel less constricted and like there was less resistance. The swelling in my throat was mostly in the upper throat where I had difficulty swallowing but not as much difficulty breathing. The numbness continued to get worse and was sometimes disappearing and reappearing in the same spot.  At 9:30 pm we went to go get some benadryl. I continued feeling less and less swelling and having an easier time breathing. At that point, I went home. Once I was home, my breathing continued to improve and the numbness started to dissipate.  In the middle of the night, I started itching and getting widespread hives and getting a sharp burning pricking pain that would last a few seconds in different areas. The numbness also started coming back mostly in my face. I continued to have difficulty swallowing.  I am feeling much better today. I still feel some slight swelling in my throat when I swallow, but my breathing is fine. I&#39;m still itchy and occasionally breaking out in hives. Im having mild lower facial numbness. I&#39;m also starting to get the normal side effects of fever, headache, arm soreness, and body aches. I&#39;m taking benadryl every 4 hours.

                                                About a minute after I had the injection, my arm started hurting and it felt like hot water was coursing through my veins. I got an immediate headache that progressed into light headedness, my vision got blurry and I saw colors and then I started to lose my hearing, it felt like there was cotton in my ears. The nurses said I went pale and they called it a panic attack, but it was unlike any panic attack I have ever had in my life. I?ve had my TDAP updated a few years ago and got a flu shot and did not feel anything like this. I was rolled out of the room on a wheel chair because I was too dizzy to walk and then threw up several times into a bag and peed myself. It took about 20 minutes before I felt normal again.   The following day my arm felt numb and incredibly sore, I couldn?t raise it that far up without excruciating pain. I felt weak, fatigued and dizzy and was unable to use the bathroom. I had fever sweats and chills on and off. I was not able to sleep well, but I think that?s because of the pain in my arm.

Started experiencing fogginess and feeling cold at 1:00 am 20Mar2021. Went to bed at 1:00 and dreamed of being sick until waking up at 8:30 am 20Mar2021. Woke up and was very weak (could not push toothpaste through toothpaste tube), almost passed out in trying, so I sat on the floor. Tried getting back to bed and was extremely nauseous and started vomiting. After that, I had the sweats/fever/chills for a couple hours (until ~11:00am), and was fatigued until 4:00 pm. Spent most of the day sleeping, unable to do anything. Today, 22Mar2021, feel slight tingling on palm of left hand and fingers. Injection site is still sore and bruised

(I am breastfeeding.) When I bent over, I had chest pain with that. Told to monitor it and if I got a fever to call back to call the doctor.  Didn&#39;t get fever and my tenderness in my breasts went away and so did  the body aches.

                                                Approximately 5 days after vaccination I started experiencing VERY strong heart palpitations, so much so I am able to see my chest move while they&#39;re happening and have captured it on my cell phone. The only other time I have experienced heart palpitations was while pregnant, I am not currently pregnant.   So far, the palpitations have continued with less severity approximately two weeks from onset. I have contacted my doctor and he has advised if they do not resolve by the end of this week/this weekend, I should contact him and we will look into an EKG and/or holter monitor.   Often while having the palpitations I am completely at rest. They have occurred randomly throughout the day and evening. They have not woken me during the night if they have happened while I sleep. I wear a smart watch daily and my heart rate appears to be normal. My heart does not race during the palpitations. There is no pain or discomfort felt while it happens. I have been able to work out every couple of days without feeling like something is wrong.

                                                I had some sort of reaction to the vaccine about 1-2 minutes after receiving it, and it was super scary and they had to call the paramedics.   After the pharmacist injected me, I felt the arm pain right away. No big deal. I walked over to the chair to sit for my 15 minutes. I was happy to be vaccinated and kind of saw it as my mini booster for my immune system that already beat COVID-19. As I sat there, the only thing I could say is, I felt a tingling cold sensation moving from my arm through me. Almost like I could feel the vaccine moving through my system. The tingling kept moving and I thought to myself, okay cool. I guess it&#39;s working. Awesome. But then my head felt cold, I felt tingling in my head, my mouth tasted like metal, saliva started to build in my mouth, I started to sweat, I felt overly sweaty all over my body, but my head felt cold and tingly.   I was staring straight ahead and everything started to go staticky, like a television set, and the static began to build and started to get starry. Everything in my vision started to fade. So I spoke out to say something weird was happening.  A man came over to talk to me and hold me up. He kept saying stuff but then my ears started ringing and I couldn&#39;t hear him anymore. I began to fade out as the stars got more intense. Then, as if it was just a mini reboot, my brain started to come back online and the picture in front of me began to fade back into view. I felt nauseous and still had a super metal taste in my mouth. They called the paramedics to give me a checkup. The metal taste in my mouth stayed the longest, but after about 45 minutes I felt well enough to go home.  On and off, I have this intense tingling inside my brain. It reminds me of a time when I was in the hospital on morphine. Just a tingling pins and needles sensation inside my head. Other than that, I am okay now. But I&#39;m concerned it&#39;s some sort of reaction because I already had COVID-19.

When I woke up two hours later I was freezing cold and my body was very achy. I ended up sleeping the rest of the day and night. On Friday I felt fine most of the day until about 10pm at night when I started having diarrhea. Throughout the night it got worse and my body got very hot to the point where I had to sleep naked with fans on me. I?m lightly short of breath, exhausted, and am still having diarrhea now (Sat).

Mom brought patient to me for assessment. When patient presented to me, patient was alert and vitals were normal. I asked patient to remain seated for 15 more minutes of observation.  Mom did say patient exhibited this behavior once before at the eye doctor.  I informed mom to please check with patients doctor for follow up. Patient exhibited some mental disability and thats is why the mother is involved. I dont believe patient is capable of taking care of herself.

                                                Was eating dinner (seasoned smoked chicken, broccoli, cauliflower, fries) and soon after, felt my lips starting to swell. I had seasonal allergies occurring that day, so I kept eating a bit longer. My tongue then started tingling. I took a dose of Children&#39;s Benadryl (all I had for Benadryl at the time). I then waited about 10 minutes before I felt my throat starting to close. We headed straight to emergency room (5 mins away). By the time I got there, I started to have a little trouble taking breaths. When I got into the trauma room moments later, I became nauseous and dry heaving.  They gave me an epinephrine shot, Benadryl, Pepto, and Prednisone.   They watched me for a few hours before release. Upon discharge, they provided me a prescription for epi-pens, famotidine, prednisone, and fexofenadine (5-day prescriptions).

                                                I got the vaccine, then was asked (due to having previous allergic reaction to Levaquin in the past, I was asked to wait 30 minutes) I got up and walked a total of 30 feet to sit in a chair. I felt completely normal, up until this point. I sat down and began to text my Mother that I had just got the vaccine &amp; I was told to wait 30 minutes, at this point (2 mins in) I felt normal. I sat my phone down on my lap and was just looking about. I began at that point (2 1/2-3 mins mark) seeing the tile floor morph; the blue tiles and the green tiles kept merging together and forming one color. Then my heart raced, immediately and I started having hot flashes that shot out my ears. My heart raced even more and at that point I had realized something wasn?t right. A National Guards member came up to me and had asked if I were okay, I explained I was not and something was not right. They took me to a medical area and made me take deep breaths, and made me drink some water. My BP was high, and my Pulse Ox had dropped slightly, and then went straight back to normal once they had asked me to stick my head between my knees and keep breathing deeply. Also, both of my ears had turned deep red/purple and they were VERY warm to the touch. They felt as if heat were tunneling out of them. The only way I can explain truly how I felt, and I have NEVER done it fully, I felt as if I was fainting. Out of nowhere I felt as if I was going to pass out ? but it didn?t happen. The entire ?spell? lasted about 20 mins? I was monitored for an additional 40 minutes and was allowed to leave.

It felt like a muscle spasm or like electricity was being pulsed through my body. First it would happen in one leg, and then the leg would curl up under my body. Then it would spasm in my chest and my arms would be drawn inward. Then the other leg, or sometime multiple locations at once. I didn&#39;t feel cold at the time. This lasted for 40 minutes total. I took 1000 mg Acetaminophen at  3:00 am.  Then, as the shaking lessened, I became very cold. I put on lots of clothes and laid on a heating pad under my comforter. Sometime later, I became very hot. Throughout the night into the morning, I felt feverish and chilled back and forth. At 6:00 am I took 200 mg Ibuprofen. I then spent the rest of the day with fever, chills, and body aches. Everything was achy and I was very tired. I slept well that night. The next day I was fatigued.

Roughly 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine, she started to feel nauseous, develop crampy abdominal pain, and feel lightheaded. She went home and took a shower and lay down in bed. When she got up she again felt nauseous and dizzy. She threw up a total of 6 times, none of which were bloody. She had several episodes of diarrhea throughout the day. Given her ongoing symptoms she presented to the ED.   On arrival, she was febrile to 39.5C, and tachycardic to 145 with BP 98/56 and SpO2 100% on room air. She was given zofran, 1L NS, and tylenol. On repeat, her BP was 75/35 (though no longer tachycardic). She was written for 2 more liters of NS and then endorsed to medicine. Her BP improved w/ SBP in the 90s-110s with continued myalgias, headaches.

I had sweatpants, two sweatshirts, slippers and 2 blankets on to help. Later on I had fallen asleep to wake my husband to uncontrollable laughter and crying, mentally I knew what I was doing was not right but I couldn&#39;t control it. I believe my feve may had spiked so high that it was border line hysteria. By morning I woke and the fever had broke however I still had no appetite, terrible headache along with weakness and fatigue....I also tried food but ended up spitting it out because everything tasted strongly of metal. Sunday I was back to tasting to food and more energy.

                                                36 y.o. female referred for the above chief complaint.   She has no significant medical history and presented with a headache that became severe 3 days ago.  She received the Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine on March 25th and had a mild headache following that which she attributed to the vaccine.  3 days ago the pain became excruciating and was associated with vomiting.  This prompted presentation to the ED where she was treated with Dilaudid. She was discharged home and has been using her mom&#39;s headache cocktail with some transient relief.  She presented back to the ED today with continued symptoms.  MRV revealed a venous sinus thrombosis and neurology was therefore consulted.   She has no history of clots personally or in the family.  Her dad did have a stroke in his 50s.  Patient otherwise denies any other associated speech change, vision change, extremity numbness, extremity weakness, coordination difficulty, or dizziness. Patient admitted to the neurology ICU and started on anticoagulation.

                                                15 mins after vaccination I began to have a scratchy throat, which gradually got worse and became thick mucus in throat, wheezing, sinus inflammation, fatigue, racing heartbeat. Symptoms became under control after 50mg of Benadryl. Thick mucus lingered until the next day. Increased heart rate leveled off after Benadryl took affect. Fully recovered by the following day.

Went to check on patient a minute later and her eyes were fluttering and her breathing altered. She did not respond to me. Her pupils dilated dramatically and she slumped over. I called for a nurse and we lowered her to the floor together. Blood pressure was low (around 100/60) Her pupils started to return to normal and she was able to converse with us. Blood pressure increased slightly but was erratic. Emergency service responders made call to take to hospital because blood pressure would not stabilize

                                                I had the expected side effects of fever and chills that evening around 8pm on the evening of the vaccine (3/13/21) and it went away by 1am. The next morning (3/14) I felt a bit tired but still had enough energy to go on my usual 8-mile run.  Just when I thought the side effects had passed, I was woken up that night by chest tightness and shortness of breath. I had to go to the ER on the evening of 3/14/21and got discharged around 2am of 3/15/21. They did and EKG and they said my heart and lungs are all in great shape and that this is probably just a vaccine side effect. They said they see it more often in Moderna but I guess it can happen with this one too. I just hope I?m not one of the rare cases that ends up in death.  I do have a history of allergies and asthma. I?m feeling better though, though I still feel something different in my chest.

I started getting very cold and shaking around 10:00 PM. My finger nails and lips started getting pale and my temperature started rising. The shaking stopped around 12:15 AM, but my fever continued as high as 101.4 throughout the night and into the morning. I continued taking Tylenol and the fever went away the morning of 3/12/21, but slight chills returned around noon that did not last long. I took more Tylenol that evening for a headache and noticed I had an on and off throbbing pain in my right ear.

                                                04/02/21 12:45 pm ? At approximately 12:45 pm I was called to vaccine tent #1 after reports from staff that a patient was feeling sick after receiving her Janssen injection. I discovered the patient slumped in her chair, head back with eyes closed, skin clammy and cool. Alert and oriented x3, speaking slowly but clearly. Per vaccine nurse, she administered the Janssen injection to patient at 12:41 pm  (Lot 1805020, exp 5/25/2021, Left Deltoid) and a few minutes later the patient started to close her eyes and leaned back in chair requiring assistance to sit up.  Nurse was able to stabilize patient in chair and then called for help and that is when I came to assist. Patient remained in this state for several more minutes. Activated EMS for further evaluation as patient did not stabilize immediately. Measured vital signs ? Blood Pressure 98/62, O2SAT 97, Pulse 68.  I continued to monitor the patient until EMS arrived. EMS evaluated patient and cleared but advised to continue to monitor for an additional 15 minutes before leaving the site. Patient verbalized understanding and agreed with plan. Patient remained in observation for an additional 15 minutes with no incident.

I went out to my car and over the next few minutes - I was getting hotter - My face was extremely hot and flushed, and hives started developing on my arms and chest. They were burning and itching; my skin was hot to the touch. My chest felt tight and my throat felt swollen, but I was able to breathe (breathe felt a little short, but I was able to take a full breathe). I was also dizzy and felt nauseous. I went to the ER, where they treated me for anaphylaxis with Benadryl, Pepcid, Breathing treatment, and a steroid. After about an hour or so I felt fine, and the dr gave me some medications to take over the next few days.

Had about a  2 second warning that I was going to faint. I felt perfectly fine prior to fainting.  After fainting where I was unconscious for 15 seconds, I was dizzy.  Today (4/4/21) - I am very tired and weak and have lower neck pain due to fall.

                                                I took the J&amp;J shot roughly at 11:50a, and naturally felt the immediate burn, and swear I felt the liquid moving through my arm. My arm was immediately tingly and numb simultaneously, and I felt...light and weird. Around 2p, I began feeling feeling lightheaded and weak, and at 6p, I had chills, severe weakness, dizziness and nausea. I couldn&#39;t stand up longer than 2 minutes without wanting to vomit and faint. I couldn&#39;t even stand up long enough to wash dishes, prepare a bowl of grapes to eat or shower. Throughout the night, I sweated so terribly from the chills to the point that my bed was soaked to the mattress pad, and currently at 2:02p on April 6th, I&#39;m still experiencing the extreme weakness, nausea, and chills.

                                                Approximately 9 hours after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA, I experienced sudden fatigue followed by onset of severe muscle and joint pain including severe head pain followed by severe chills followed by fever and excessive sweating. I was very dizzy and felt disoriented. I was in bed when all this happened and was already wearing warm clothes under the covers. The muscle and joint pain was so severe, I couldn&#39;t grip anything including my cell phone (my wrists were in sharp pain). The head pain was so severe I was sensitive to light regardless of how dim it was. I felt like my toes were curled, but that could have been me &#34;bracing&#34; and tightening up due to the total body pain. I could move very little. It was very strange. These symptoms persisted through the night. The following morning at around 9am, I still had a very bad headache that made me nauseated and continued to be sensitive to light. Some of the joint and muscle pain tapered down enough for me to get out of bed to go potty but it was exhausting to walk 5 feet to the bathroom and then get back in bed. I still ran a mild fever. At around 1pm I took a Tylenol that helped subside the symptoms but felt wiped out all day. By the following day (Monday), I was feeling better getting more energy and by that Monday evening, I felt like nothing ever happened. I&#39;m sure these just fall into perhaps the more severe level of the side effects, but I was frightened by the intense sharp muscle and joint pain to the point I couldn&#39;t even grip anything.

                                                Immediately after I got it I felt different. Fight or flight response kicked in. My heart started racing and chest felt tighter. It felt like I just ran a marathon. My breathing increased and I felt very dizzy and lightheaded. I stayed in the store and walked around hoping symptoms wouldn&#39;t get worse for 25 minutes then left. I had my three small children with me and wanted to get them home. I called my husband who is a physician and told him everything I was experiencing. He told me to stay in the store to see how things went. I then drove home to monitor my symptoms. I had post nasal drip and it exacerbated over the next few weeks. I was on two different antibiotics because it felt like I had a bad ear infection. It never went away. I saw an ENT and my tympanaplasty that I had as a child blew. I have a large hole in my ear drum currently and very dizzy. I am getting a CT of my ear this Wednesday and I will have to have surgery in the next few months for another tympanoplasty.

                                                Immediately began to feel a headache, dizzy and nauseated.  The doctor on site had me lie down on the floor. Was starting to feel better so was able to sit up in a chair for about 15 minutes. Another wave of dizziness and nausea came over and was lying on the floor again. It was hard to breathe, but oxygen and HR were good. The doctor tried to give me juice to see if it was my blood sugar going low, but afterward, I still felt dizzy and nauseated. It was still hard to breathe. It felt like something was sitting on my chest. BP was elevated, oxygen levels were good, HR was good but I started to get a cold chill where my teeth were chattering. At that point (about 45 min to an hour) the symptoms had not gone away and the ambulance was called. Was transported to the local hospital where I received a liter of saline and Zofran for nausea.  BP was high, but oxygen levels and HR were good. The heart monitor showed no signs of arrhythmia or tachycardia so I was discharged. The doctor believes it was a side effect and not an allergic reaction.

I fainted at table, then my spouse didn&#39;t know when he came downstairs, he thought my head was just resting at the table. He asked if I wanted to walk to the couch to rest, and as he helped me do so, I fainted and he caught me and carried me to the couch. Recovered within 1 minute but my hearing was  fuzzy for a couple more minutes, sounded like static in my ears.  Other reactions were:  Standard ones I read could happen- Fever of 100.1 that lasted less than a day, chills, aches, warm feeling and fatigue.

The symptoms subsided about an hour later. Around 11pm, I started to have wheezing, chest tightness, and back pain. I have been using my inhaler and nebulizer since last night for the wheezing. I spoke to a doctor through phone who confirmed these aren&#39;t normal side effects from the vaccine.

                                                Starting in the afternoon after my shot I started feeling extremely cold. I had chills and my teeth were actually chattering at one point it was so bad. This gradually got worse as the evening went on. With it I also started feeling weak and fatigued. By 8pm I started to have a headache. Throughout the night symptoms worsened and I had a fever and more serious headache. My head was pounding so badly. I couldn&#39;t sleep at all. I also had a couple hot flashes to where I woke up sweating. Then I would feel frozen again. The nausea started during the night too. I thought I would throw up but didn&#39;t. At one point my heart was racing so fast I was a little concerned something bad would happen to me and contemplated going to the hospital. By morning I felt a little better, still nauseous and with a bad headache. My body was a little weak. These symptoms lasted all day Thursday. By that Friday morning I only had a little weakness and slight headache. By mid day Friday I was pretty much back to normal.

This nurse was informed of this event a few minutes later and went over to assess patient. on a scale of 1-10, patient described the chest pressure as 2 or 3. She denied any other symptoms. No s/s of resp. distress notes. BP taken noted at 106/72, Pulse 71 pulse Ox on room air 99%.  Within a few minutes more of observing patient, she reported complete resolution of her chest pressure. She remained in observation area for a total of 30 minutes. BP notes at 96/67, PR 70. This nurse suggested for patient to eat some chips and hydrate to increase her BP but patient 97/67 BP was a normal for her since she was vegan. She probably couldn&#39;t have the chips. Also informed patient if symptoms  reoccur she should see medical attention. patient verbalized understanding.

Few hours later developed typical &#34;flu like symptoms&#34;.  Next day woke up and both arms, hands, legs and feet and side of face had pins and needles and felt numb. Heart rate sky rocketed and went to ER. Felt like I was going to pass out.  Took blood work at hospital and doctors reassured that the feeling should come back in my legs and arms. When I left  6 hours later my legs were still pins and needles and my joints began to hurt.  A week later and this feeling continues to come and go, but is not consistent.  My joints still randomly hurt and I am an active 38 year old with three kids.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 vaccine was administered to patient and the patient immediately reported pain at injection site, change in taste, and trouble breathing. Patient began gasping for air. The patient remained aware and able to communicate. I instructed a tech to call 911 and the operator instructed me to use a dose of epinephrine. After administration, the patient&#39;s breathing improved. EMT&#39;s arrived and took over care for the patient. I informed them of the time of vaccination and the time of epinephrine administration. The patient was then taken to the hospital to receive additional care.

                                                Shortly after the vaccine on the drive home the injection site got super hot, the arm began to swell and turn red.  I developed a fever and my sinuses got really stuffy.  I began to throw up profusely which made all symptoms from other issues occur causing me to swell all over and because I couldnt take any meds or keep anything down I went to the ER.   While there I began wheezing and experiencing SOB which still is an issue today.  I have foggy moments where my brain seems so foggy that I am having issues with my short term memory.  I was administered IV fluids, IV morphine and IV ibuphropen to help with the symptoms and was hospitalized for less than a day further evaluation

My heart rate was resting at 115 for hours at work, which is abnormal for my heart rate. I checked into the ER  around 5:30 pm. The ER gave me a bag of fluid and an EKG. The EKG came back normal. This all happened on March 17, 2021.

                                                I have a history of anaphylaxis, and disclosed that to the medics so they watched me more carefully, which was good, as while I did not experience anything that severe, I did immediately get itchy, turn red and feel quite nauseated. However,  after they monitored me awhile, I told them I felt okay to go home. The next day I had the expected mild flu-like symptoms, which I anticipated. However, what?s been atypical is they returned tenfold three days later. This time with a much higher fever (103), severe chills, fatigue, a seemingly never-ending headache,  muscle spasms,  chest palpitations and suddenly I am experiencing asthma (which is typically seasonal) and am coughing, too.  I?m now a week past when I was vaccinated and each day was feel worse, not better. I have had to cancel my clients and hire a sitter to care for my kids as I am too weak and ill to do it.  I looked up common reactions and nothing states chest pain and/or asthma, nor that it should last this long. That said, as I am high-risk, I work from home and homeschool both of my young kids. Thus, I have been nowhere aside from the vaccine site. Moreover, my partner, our kids and sitter get routinely tested for me,  and everyone is negative. Thus, it appears I am having prolonged, heightened side-effects much more intense than the ?mild? flu-like symptoms otherwise reported, which is concerning. I took no medication prior to receiving the vaccine, either.

I elevated over the next 24 hours frequently an swelling went away.  2 - On Friday, March 26, swollen glands under my left armpit (shot received in left arm), swelling is completely gone as of 3/29.  3 - the evening of 3/28/21 I became itchy on my scalp, arms and back.  I have showered and applied lotion and have not introduced anything new to my routine which is why I believe it may be shot related and worth mentioning.  The intensity is mild but if it persists or worsens I will contact my doctor.

Couldn?t open eyes or move fingers.  Light headed...blacking out when I got up to go the bathroom.  Couldn?t have any sounds (like tv) on.  Just needed to lay still and sleep.    The above lasted 19 hours.    Then my temperature ended.  I had trouble walking and standing for another 20 hours. No stamina.   I went to work near the end of this and noticed I had trouble looking at my paperwork and figuring what to do for my job.  Not sure if this was still the fatigue just in a different way.  Then it disappeared.

Around 11 PM, I began to experience chills. Around midnight, I developed a pounding headache. Around 1 AM, I began to experience muscle pain. Around 2 AM, I began to experience nausea and sweating. Around 3 AM, I experienced tachycardia, with a pulse rate of between 110 and 120 beats per minute while lying down. Throughout the time, I was lying in bed but not sleeping. I was unable to work the next day and spent most of it in bed.
