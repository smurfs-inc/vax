After awaking he doesn&#39;t remember the last 5 minutes. He laid down to go to sleep and was consistently hot and then cold. He does have a history of night terrors but they have remained dormant for about 2.5 years. Around 12 am he started having one of the worst night terrors I&#39;ve seen. The following morning, April 2nd 2021, he was feeling incredibly sore and the injection spot was tender. He said &#34;it feels like I got hit by a truck.&#34; Seems to be doing okay otherwise now.

About 5 minutes after vaccination, another patient came over and said that was not feeling well. When going out to patient I noticed he was very pale and sweating.  The patient then proceeded to pass out. I was able to hold the patients head and the other customer was able to hold his shoulders to make sure he did not fall out of the chair. The patient then got very stiff and proceeded to push back in his chair, after about 10 seconds he relaxed. The patient was passed out for about 3 mins, during that time I was able to remove his mask and hold his head. After gaining consciousness, I was able to make sure he was ok. We were able to give him some water and he stated he felt better. I asked the patient to stay for another half hour to monitor. After giving the patient another bottle of water, and having him sit he was able to get up and leave.

                                                Only minor chills before bed, 11pm. Muscle aches, felt as tightness in IT bands, made remaining asleep difficult. Got up to use the bathroom around 5am. Upon finishing peeing while standing, I lost consciousness, falling. As a result of the fall, I fractured my cheek bone, cut open my ear, later requiring three stitches, and was concussed, resulting in a loss of memory. I was nonresponsive when my fiance found me immediately following the crash, and was rushed to the hospital  via ambulance. Upon arrival to the hospital, my fever was found to be 102 F. As a result of the fall, I have a cheek bone fracture, three stiches in my ear, and a concussion.

I went back and checked on him after 5mins of waiting, then came back to the pharmacy. But heard a big bang shortly after. Some how, he had fallen out of his chair and bumped his head and neck on an end camp. He seemed a little confused, when I ran over, but was awake, a little sweaty and nauseated. EMS was called. They transported him to ER to have his head checked, since he bumped it.

                                                The patient was nervous prior to vaccine and had a needle phobia. About 5 minutes post-vaccine, the patient stated he was not feeling well and feeling warm and sweaty. The pharmacy staff provided the patient with water and an ice pack. The patient stated he was feeling faint. The patient fainted for about 20 seconds and then became conscious again. The patient didn&#39;t have any injuries and didn&#39;t fall down. The patient was okay and he laid down and elevated his feet on a chair. He then stated that he has severe needle phobia and has fainted several times in the past with vaccine administration and blood draws. He had experienced this in the past. He was still slightly faint and requested that he be checked out. The EMT arrived and they took his vitals and checked him. By the time the EMT arrived, he was beginning to feel better and had sat up and drinking water. There were no further issues. The EMT stated he was good to head home. We followed up with patient and the patient was feeling good with no further issues.

                                                I received the J&amp;J vaccine at 10:00am on March 18, 2021 at the Community Center. By about 5:00pm, I started to feel minor flu-like symptoms, but as the night progressed it got significantly worse. Around 8-9pm, I was bedridden with the worst chills/shaking I&#39;ve ever experienced in my life. Around 9:30-10:00pm, I was filling water at my sink and projectile vomitted multiple times into the sink and could not make it to the bathroom. Subsequently, I ate a bagel and drank lots of water, knowing my vomitting could make me dehydrated. Throughout the night, I was awake and shaking, and drank and filled my water bottle repeatedly. At 8:00am, I was filling my water, and without my knowledge of awareness, fainted on my kitchen floor, dropping the Brita filter and likely hitting my head. My roommate heard the commotion and saw me passed out in our kitchen. He tried to wake me up and I phased in, but then subsequently phased out again 20-30 seconds later as I was trying to stand and likely hit my head again. My roommate eventually got me over to our couch and called EMTs. Upon their arrival, EMTs checked my pulse, which was fine, and saw an open laceration on the back of my head, so they took me to Hospital to access the Trauma Center. On the way, I threw up repeatedly and was very lightheaded. Upon my arrival at Hospital, I was checked for any neck bone breaks, given an IV, a CT  scan, an EKG, and staples were placed in the back of my head to heal the laceration. After my release, I was bedridden for 2-3 days and required a daily nap during work (1-2) hours for the next 1 1/2 to 2 weeks. For a while, everything was fine, but recently during the first two weeks of April, it has become apparent that my head is foggy and reacts to changes in the weather, which leads me to believe that I likely banged my head pretty good when I fainted those two times.

                                                Apart from headaches and general nausea I began to shake uncontrollably around 5pm which lasted about 15 min. Then later in the evening it happened again but this time it was hard to breathe because everything in my body was so tight. This lasted until I got into the shower with the temperature set as hot as I could.

                                                On 04/04/21, around 11 AM, the customer walked in for his COVID vaccine appointment.  After registering for the vaccine , the patient sat in the designated area and one of our immunizing technicians administered the vaccine while I was observing and I left the immunization area while my technician was finishing up cleaning. When the patient asked the immunizing technician a question about side effects, she offered him to talk to the pharmacist at the consultation window. While I was assisting the next customer, I heard a loud sound and saw the customer collapsing on the floor. I ran outside and checked his pulse, and asked to call 911. He was conscious and breathing. I went inside the pharmacy to get EpiPen and informed the customer that I will be administering EpiPen, but he denied it. In the meantime, the immunizing technician was already on hold with 911 and informed that they are on the way. The customers in the waiting area also kept him engaged and were watching him if he is alert. The store manager on duty was also in the pharmacy area. I came inside the pharmacy and offered the patient a chair to sit in. Paramedics arrived in a few minutes to transport him to the hospital. The patient came back to the pharmacy around 2:30PM to collect his immunization card and when I inquired about how he is doing, the patient informed me that he is feeling more better and the ER determined that there was no allergic reaction to the vaccine but the patient most likely stood up too quickly after the vaccine was administered.

Since the event i have been feeling slightly fatigued and i have a slight feverish feeling, but in general have been able to rest and have not had a repeat occurrence. I received no medical attention or treatment.

                                                Around 6 pm the same day I received the J&amp;J shot I started to feel chilly and a little nausea. I went for a walk for about 40 mins started to feel worse. I had body aches throughout my back and chest and in both arms, was freezing. Tried to eat dinner but couldn?t, too much pain and increased nausea. Tried to lay down, but began having a fast heartbeat and fast/some difficulty breathing. The pain in my chest was the worst pain I?ve ever felt. Continued feeling horrible with a fever of 100.7, nausea, headache pains throughout chest back and arms, freezing, and my arms and legs felt like they were becoming numb. Could not stand, very dizzy, tried to sleep through it. I threw up around 11 and did so a couple more times after that. Was finally able to sleep and woke up feeling much better. Arm is still sore at the injection point.

                                                I gave the vaccine around 6:20pm after counseling on possible adverse reactions and going over the patient&#39;s questions. I then asked them to wait 15min. Within 5-10mins the patient got up and came back to our counter saying he thinks he&#39;s having a reaction. I pulled him back into our vaccination area and had him sit down and explain what he was feeling to me. He looked pale and told me he felt dizzy, sweaty, shaky, &amp; nauseous. He wanted me to grab him a bag incase he puked. I grabbed a bag as well as water and Benadryl. I asked if he was having any issues breathing or if it felt like his tongue was swollen at all. He said no issues breathing and tongue felt fine.  He started to feel better within about 10-15 minutes after onset. He did not puke and his color returned. I had him wait an additional 10-15 minutes after that to make sure we were recovered. I asked him if there was anything else going on and he mentioned that he hadn&#39;t slept well the night before and that he had barely eaten today. He also mentioned he can get anxiety. I told him all of those factors could certainly contribute to what he just experienced but that I would be reporting this on to be safe.

                                                The patient had symptoms of light-headedness, diaphoresis, and was pale approximately 8 minutes after administration.  No signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis were identified so the patient was observed and monitored.  The patient then became unconscious for approximately 10-15 seconds with small jerking movements identified during this time. 911 was called and the patient was monitored until EMS arrived.  Epinephrine was prepared and ready during this whole time but was not administered because the patient didn&#39;t show symptoms of anaphylaxis (trouble breathing or talking, trouble swallowing, hives, flushing etc).  The  time from vaccine administration to EMS arrival was approximately 20-25 minutes.   The patient was able to talk and communicate clearly the entire time except during the brief unconscious period.

My adverse effects were the following throwing up, pain in the upper Portion of my neck and slight pain in my chest , and fever with chills  grandually getting worse throughout the day.  By 9:00pm - midnight I couldn?t even sleep or close my eyes to sleep because the pain was unbarring that I had to call my family for mental support.  I eventually fell asleep because of exhaustion, and Sunday I couldn?t even get out of bed my body was so worn out from the shot and the night. I stayed home all day and slept . I still  have pains in my neck and coughing becomes my issue.

                                                ED NOTE is as follows...from 4/21/21 @ 21:47    a 28 y.o. male who to the emergency room with reports of a headache for the last 48 hours.  He reports this as being one of the worst headaches he has ever had.  He was seen at urgent care and given Toradol, Zofran and Benadryl and still rates his pain an 8 out of 10.  He does feel pressure behind his eyes.  And reports vomiting in the parking lot at urgent care.  He denies abdominal pain back pain, neck pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, numbness or tingling or any other worsening concerns.  Reports that he did receive a recent Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination.  Patient states he does vape.  He occasionally drinks alcohol he denies any illicit drugs.  Patient denies any head trauma.   Diagnosis management comments: This is a 28-year-old male arrives to the emergency room with reported migraine headache for the last 48 hours.  He did report that he was go to urgent care in which he received a migraine cocktail of Zofran, Benadryl and Toradol.  Patient reported that his headache was not resolved so urgent care sent him on for further evaluation.  Patient upon arrival had a negative neurological exam however he did report that he had pressure behind his eyes.  Was unable to see any papilledema on funduscopic exam.  Check patient&#39;s pressures bilaterally and they were 21 and 18.  Patient did report to me that this was the worst headache of his life.  I did administer IV fluids here as well as Tylenol and morphine.  Patient did report some improvement.  Patient did report in his past medical history had a recent Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination.  A CBC and CMP was obtained.  Did have thrombocytopenia with a count of 66.  Since my exam was PERRL with normal extraocular movements.  He had no eye redness or eye pain.  Of low concerns for any iritis or uveitis.  Patient&#39;s patient CT of his head did show a abnormal CT that had a dense appearing superior sagittal sinus that was representing a venous thrombosis.  Radiologist did recommend a MRI MRV.  An MRI and MRV was ordered.  Patient MRI MRv did show findings are consistent with a venous thrombosis involving the right jugular right transverse sinus and superior sagittal sinus there is also a patchy edematous change within the subcortical white matter areas bilaterally and symmetrically.  There was no CVA.  With patient&#39;s reported migraine headache.  Reported blurred vision, low platelets, recent vaccination I do believe patient has vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia.  With this finding I did converse with my overseeing physician Calls were made out to neurology and then a call out did prefer to have patient started on IVIG at 1 g/kg daily for 2 days and blood thinner Xarelto 15 mg p.o. twice daily.  These orders were initiated.  Internal med services was consulted and with conversations of family, internal med services out possible transfer that an interventionalists could be available if patient needed it.  Report was given at 2100 upon my end of shift.

Within 5-10 minutes, I was sitting in the car and sending a text and with no warning whatsoever mid-text lost consciousness, profuse sweating, wheezing, lost color in my skin, was making unintelligible noises, and eventually woke up about a minute later but couldn&#39;t speak or comprehend those speaking to me (according to my wife who was terrified).  I was not nervous, stressed, or scared of receiving a vaccine. I regained the ability to speak about a minute later and my wife had summoned the staff on the scene who instructed me to lie back and breathe without a mask. I drank some liquids. A nurse was called over and offered to take my vital signs but I decided I felt ok enough not to. Eventually my normal skin color and came back and sweating stopped after about 5 minutes. We sat for a few extra minutes and once I felt it was past me,  my wife drove us home.

                                                I had extreme chest pain on the 24th of March. It really hurt to breathe and it felt like I had pressure on my chest. I went to the Emergency room and they did a chest x-ray and a Covid-19 both of which were negative. I went home and I returned to the ER because the chest pain became worse. The chest X-Ray the second day showed I had pneumonia. I was told that it could have been from the Covid-19 in December or if was community acquired.  I was prescribed with antibiotics and discharged. I still feel some chest pain  after about a week and I have already finished the full course of antibiotics. I&#39;ve seen my Primary Care physician, my cardiologist and my Pulmonologist.

                                                At approximately 4 pm, I gave the patient a Janssen covid-19 vaccination. I asked the patient to sit for 15 minutes for observation. About 10 minutes later I was notified someone wasn&#39;t doing well. I went to the patient and he was hunched down and looked pale and he stated he was very dizzy. I asked him if he had trouble breathing and he stated he had not. He appeared like he was about to pass out, I was asking him questions about his state and he wasn&#39;t being coherent. I told him I was going to give an EpiPen and call 911. I gave him the EpiPen in his outer thigh. EMS came 5 minutes later.  A few hours later I got a call from a close by asking if I had given him a Benadryl because he was feeling drowsy. I asked his status and the nurse stated he was doing fine.

My normal is 62-75 bpm. While I was sleeping, my heart rate ranged from 93-113 bpm (according to Apple Watch). Extreme headache Inability to sleep Chills and shakes Extreme fatigue Light headed and unable to speak clearly  I don?t know if this was life threatening; I know it was likely my immune system responding but these side effects were extreme. I almost called an ambulance. I?ve never felt pain like that before in my head. My heart felt like it was racing all night and my brain felt like it was going to expand out of my skull. The head pain, heart rate, and rapid breathing was keeping me up.  I tried to sleep 7pm?12am which was the worst of it. By the middle of the night, it seemed that the fever subsided and my resting heart rate was more in the 90-100 range (still 15-30% high).   The next day, I have a moderate headache that feels like after pain from the night before. Fever subsided. Heart rate is slightly high at 80-100 bpm. I managed to sleep in the whole morning.  I had to take off from work today in order to rest.

I move to my bed. 7:30 PM - In bed, dressed in sweatshirt, wool socks, etc., a a couple blankets wrapped around me, space heater turned to 80 degrees, shaking uncontrollably from being so cold (mostly hands and feet), mild headache begins in middle back of head.  8:00 PM - still freezing, temperature was at 98.7. most of body is aching 9:00 PM - chills and body ache starting to slow down, temperature at 100.3 9:30 PM - still have chills, space heater still on and i was still wrapped in a bunch of clothing/blankets. temp at 100.5 and i drank 6 oz water.  10 PM - chills going away, heat/blankets/clothing still on, temp at 101. body aches mostly only in left and right calf.   Rest of night until around 4 A.M. was me tossing and turning being restless. My heart rate was ~130 BPM throughout the entire night according to my smart watch. I was checking my temperature constantly with an infrared thermometer and it was between 101-102.5. I probably drank ~24 oz of water throughout the night. It felt like each time i fell asleep, i would wake up no more than 30 min later and each time i woke up it felt like i had been asleep for 5 hours. At a few moments it felt like i was hallucinating seeing little boxes around my head.. At no point  during the episode did i take any advil/tyenol/etc. Only drank water. Woke up around noon the next day, I felt extremely groggy, still had a headache and my temperature was back to ~98.  I ate for the first time that day around 1 P.M. and had a few advil which helped with my headache.

                                                Patient was looking pale a minute after the shot, I asked how he was doing, he responded by saying he felt very dizzy. I asked him to take slow deep breaths, gave him some water. About after 1 more minute he passed out (very unresponsive but still breathing, pupils very dilated) pulse was slow but still palpable. Tried ammonium smelling salts, that did not bring patient around. Called 911. Tried patting patient and talking to patient to bring them back to consciousness. After about a minute or two patient was able to respond to me. He knew his name and date of birth and where he was. Asked him to wait for ambulance to check vitals. Patient said he still felt very dizzy. Kept his head down and eyes closed. Once EMS arrived they checked his vitals, determined BP was low (they did not tell me a number). They monitored patient&#39;s vitals for 10-15 minutes. BP did not &#34;bounce back&#34; per EMS so they took him to the hospital for IV drip possibly.

No treatment sought at this time.

                                                After receiving the Janssen Covid 19 vaccine, I proceeded to the waiting area and was instructed to wait 15 minutes before leaving the facility. Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the injection, I started to feel faint, lightheaded, nausea, and clammy. I informed a member of the staff and several medical personnel came to assist. They laid me down on a cot and checked my vitals. I started to feel better after laying down. The staff took my blood pressure and heart rate readings, which were relatively normal. But after sitting me up and taking my vitals again, my blood pressure and heart rate spiked. I was taken to Hospital in an ambulance; however, after waiting in the ER waiting room for about 2.5 hours, I left without seeing a doctor. During those 2.5 hours my original symptoms did not return, so I elected to leave.

He said that he was texting on his phone and the next thing he knew, he was on the ground with people around him asking if he was ok. He stated that he was very sweaty, nauseous, and a little dizzy. We called a code white, provided the pt with a cold compress and elevated his feet. Pt did not want us to call 911. Pt did not have PCP and has not been to a doctor in about 5 years. He said he was very nervous getting the shot and is afraid of needles so that may have contributed. Pt stayed in the pharmacy area for about 45 minutes until he started to feel better and his mom came to get him. I tried calling pt again at 7:10pm to check in, but there was no answer and I could not leave a voicemail due to mailbox being full.

                                                I developed extreme body aches and chills along with an extreme fever, and it progressed throughout the night until I was delirious. I fainted once trying to take medication (ibeprofen) in the bathroom. I never measured the fever because I was delirious and could hardly move due to pain. I have never felt so sick in my life and I am a healthy 30 year old with no other health issues. I am feeling better this morning but have lingering symptoms of chills and aches. I am reporting this because the intensity of the reaction seemed overwhelmingly extreme and scary for someone of my health and age.

                                                I received the vaccine on Wednesday, April 7th.  I was told I had an anaphylactic reaction at the time of injection: I started sweating upon receiving the vaccine, my blood pressure dropped, and I almost passed out. I was monitored for 30 mins before being sent home. Other than some fatigue, I was fine the rest of the day.  On Thursday, April 8th, I was tired but felt fine otherwise.  Friday and Saturday, April 9th and 10th, I felt like I was back to normal and even did some light exercise.  On Sunday morning, April 10th, the left side of my body (side of injection) went numb, I had extreme vertigo, shortness of breath, and blotches that appeared in random places. It didn&#39;t look like hives, but rather looked like strips of red. I didn&#39;t feel like I was having an allergic reaction, but something did not feel right. I consider myself a pretty healthy guy with a healthy lifestyle. I did not feel the need to go to the ER quite yet, but I did have a friend come over to monitor me.  My friend did some acupuncture which helped resolve the numbness and dizziness and some of the blotches, and also mentioned concerns regarding blood circulation and potential clotting issues she thought I was having.

After washing my hands, I turned to the towel and vaguely remember falling to the floor. When I came to, I was too weak to get up. I laid there for 5 minutes before struggling to sit. After some time I was able to weakly return to bed and drank some rehydration tablets. My best guess was I had been drinking water but not replenishing my electrolytes.

I had the Janssen vaccine shot at around 5PM on Thursday and felt mostly fine on Friday. I had typical shot symptoms (tired and soreness near injection sight). On Friday night around 10:00, I was standing talking to one of my friends in the living room when I had a blackout seizure without any warning. The seizure only lasted about 30-45 seconds, and then I became conscious again. It took me about 5-10 minutes to become completely aware and able to stand up. I have never had a seizure before and have not had one since then.  Later the following week, I did have a couple of hours where I felt extremely dizzy and lightheaded, but it went away without another seizure. This is also not typical for me.

I did not experience any symptoms as severe as this at any point again.

                                                Patient is 31 year old male who came in today to get his Janssen Covid-19 vaccine.  He came with his wife and father-in-law.   He verbalized ahead of time that he has a history of fainting due to his fear of needles.  He does not have any allergic reaction to vaccine components.  After reviewing his PQCF and possible side effects of the vaccine, patient verbally consented to get vaccinated.  I administered the vaccine into the deltoid muscle of his right arm.  I gave him an ice pack.  Right after the vaccine was administered patient said he felt fine.  He relocated from the immunization booth to a Post Vaccine waiting chair with his wife by his side.  He fainted into his wifes&#39;s arms for about 30 seconds.  His father-in-law helped place him on his back on the floor and we raised his legs up on a chair.  Patient came to immediately when placed on supine position and said he just needed to rest.  We called Code White and assistant manager came to the scene.  Patient was conscious and verbalized that he was feeling fine but should just rest.  Patient continued to use ice pack and rested for about 30 minutes.

                                                Patient was in attendance at the JANSSEN vaccination clinic on 4/9/21.  After vaccination while he was in the observation area, PT experienced a syncopal episode and hit his head on the window sill next to where he was sitting.  Staff responded and assessed PT and decided to initiate a MET call.  There was concern that the patient may have experienced a seizure.  Patient was taken to the Emergency Department.  Patient was ultimately admitted on 4/9/21 with new onset of a. fib.  He was discharged on 4/11/21.  While hospitalized, the patient received IV cardizem

The next morning, these symptoms had all gone away. A couple of days after the vaccination, I believe on 3/23/2021, I began experiencing unexplained back pain and shortness of breath. This pain was severe at time and I still have a dull pain in my back as of today, 4/15/2021.

Felt as though nausea was impending. Sensation rose into skull in &#34;crawling waves&#34;. Skull felt heavy. Interpreted the sensation as disorientation. Asked pharmacist if dizziness was normal with the vaccine. Woke up a few seconds later picking myself up off the floor.

We pulled of the freeway and I walked around for a few minutes trying to catch my breath but I was unable to. My wife started to drive and I as I sat in the passenger seat I started getting the chills and all the muscles in my body were shaking. When we got to town I told my wife we needed to go to the ER because I was not feeling well. That is where they did some tests and hooked me up to an IV.

When I returned, I got intense chills and a fever of 103 degrees along with some flu like symptoms. I had a slight headache. Ibuprofen helped but the next day I had similar symptoms, but they went away by the end of the day. On the third day I felt a little better, so I went for a run. I had some shortness of breath and it was difficult to breathe when I was running. I normally run 4 miles daily. The shortness of breath was present for a week after that and also started to happen intermittently even at rest. One week after the shot I saw a doctor and they did some testing but did not find anything definitive. Six weeks after the shot I went to the ER and they diagnosed with Thrombocytopenia. At this point it has been seven weeks the shortness of breath has improved, and I haven&#39;t experienced it for a few days.

I went to check on him and he was yellowish in color and barely able to speak to me. I asked another pharmacist to get me a cold pack and water. By the time we got the cold pack and water, he was not speaking, but eyes were open. I called 911 and the other pharmacist fanned him and placed the cold pack on his head and neck. He started talking within minutes and we waited for ambulance to come just to check him out. He was ablet to verify his name and where he was and EMSA came at 3:50pm. He left to their truck and said he was okay just felt shaky and clammy, but he could hear everyone talking to him.

                                                Approximately 2 minutes after the patient received the vaccine, the patient had other questions and while talking about the vaccine, the patient&#39;s eyes rolled back and he experienced a vasovagal reaction (syncope). Although he was sitting in a chair, his head fell to the left and his forehead bumped the table. The patient&#39;s legs were elevated and his upper body was laid back. Ammonia inhalant was crushed and immediately placed under the patient&#39;s nose. The patient came back to consciousness approximately 30 seconds after passing out. Patient was asked what symptoms he felt leading up to passing out. He said that he suddenly felt dizzy and does not remember much after. Patient states that he did not eat breakfast prior to receiving the vaccine and has a history of not doing well with needles or vaccines. He states that he now feels completely fine, however, the patient was advised to stay 30 minutes for monitoring, and once he felt comfortable standing up, a nurse walked with him to the observation area. Patient was provided an ice pack for his forehead. Observation nurse was notified of the adverse event and is now monitoring the patient.

                                                fainting and patient fell on ground (hitting forehead), 911 was called; the patient came around in 10 seconds or so.  Patient said they felt a little nauseous but then dizzy and things went dark. We kept them laying down on the floor with knees up, took their BP (127/72) and waited for medics to come. Medics arrived within 10 minutes to evaluate the patient, offered to take them to the hospital, patient declined and they released them to take it easy and call them/go to hospital if they felt faint again.

                                                I typically faint when getting shots or blood drawn. I did faint about 10 seconds after the initial shot injection. I was conscious throughout but was not able to speak clearly or control my body even though I could hear everything going on around me. After 30 minutes, I was feeling back to normal. The remainder of the day I felt drowsy and a little out of it. At 12:15am I began to get severe chills and shakes. This lasted throughout the night but was the worst from about 12:15-1:00am. I woke up at 4am with a fever and sweating. My entire body was stiff and in pain with aches specifically in my arms and legs. Very sore pain in my left deltoid where the shot was injected and is still slightly sensitive. It felt like my veins were stiff and in pain and it hurt to move. I had what I can describe as flu like symptoms (i.e. my teeth hurt, my body ached, fever, shakes, body stiffness and overall tiredness and weakness). These all lasted until about 6:30am at the worst and were relieved over the next few hours. I started to feel back to normal around 3pm later that day. That was April 11th. Last night, April 12th, I had trouble sleeping because my left arm was in pain from my elbow to fingers. It was a lingering pain that went away by this morning and  is mostly gone now (morning April 13th).

                                                I opted for the J&amp;J variant and received it on Monday at 1:00 PM, mere hours before they pulled distribution of it on the national level.  I started feeling flu like fatigue, body aches, and a headache 8 hours post injection. I ran a 101&#43; fever Monday night and got less than 4 hours sleep due to fever and fairly intense muscle aches. On Tuesday morning the headache, fever and muscle aches persisted till the late evening accompanied by general fatigue. By 9:00 on Tuesday night I was feeling significant improvement and slept well Tuesday night with minor night sweats on and off. Wednesday morning I felt 80% back to normal. No fever, minor headache only evident when standing up quickly or sudden head movement, and continued muscles aches body wide specifically in the neck and chest as well as injection site muscle soreness. These symptoms continue to persist into Thursday at the same or perhaps slightly elevated levels. Friday 4/15 symptoms persist with generalized soreness, fatigue, headache,  injection site soreness. Not his typical self.

                                                I experienced a sudden onset of symptoms approximately 7 hours post-vaccination. Symptoms started with severe chills, elevated heart rate, fever (~102), and progressed into muscle and joint soreness, severe migraine with sensitivity to light, and strong fatigue, coupled with insomnia. The symptoms were severe enough that I considered going to the hospital, but ultimately did not. Fever, chills, and elevated heart rate subsided by the next morning (~12 hours after onset), but muscle soreness, migraine, and fatigue lasted for another 12-24 hours, along with a loss of appetite.  I am an otherwise healthy, male adult with no outstanding medical conditions whatsoever. This was one of the most severe immune responses I have ever had, including actual illnesses. I have received other vaccinations in the past and never had any response nearly as severe. I was significantly concerned for my overall health during the height of the vaccine response, and I wanted to report this to ensure that is aware of these types of responses, and can help prepare others by informing them adequately of the types of responses to expect from the vaccine. This response very much took me by surprise in terms of severity -- I had to call out of work at a critical time.

                                                Covid-19 vaccine JJ: 32 y.o. male w/ no PMH presenting 2 weeks after receiving his Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID vaccine after having severe L calf pain found to have thrombocytopenia.    From H&amp;P on 4/21, Patient reports that he had both fevers and aches after his vaccine (4/8/2021). Several days later developed low back pain radiating into his left leg which he initially attributed to sciatica. However, several days later, he went for a 6 mile hike, and felt that his left leg was hurting more. He went to PCP, where he received a blood test and was found to have a platelet count in the low 60s. This was initially thought to be a lab error, but he noticed that his left leg was swollen, somewhat red, and appeared that his blood vessels were swollen. This swelling resolves when he is lying down, and is worsened when he is standing. He received an US to r/o DVT, which was negative. However, after his repeat platelet count demonstrated thrombocytopenia, he was sent to the ED. He denies any recent leg trauma, though he has broken his leg before nearly 15 years ago.  He denies weakness or issues going to the bathroom. Denies chest pain or shortness of breath. Denies chills, fevers, but did wake up last 2 nights drenched in sweat. He also reports a petechial rash on his legs.   As of 4/22, medical team suspects Vaccine-induced thrombocytopenic purpura (VITT). VITT requires 1) thrombocytopenia, 2) documented clot, 3) positive PF4 Ab, and 4) recent AstraZeneca or J&amp;J vaccine. He meets criteria 1, 3, and 4. He has clinical signs of DVT but does not have a documented clot. Patient has L calf tenderness and prominent pooling of blood and vein engorgement of the L leg when he stands up. Possible that he had a DVT or multiple that cleared and now he has post-thrombotic syndrome. This is consistent with the pooling of blood with gravity and relief of symptoms with elevation. As he has had 2 negative US for DVT, unlikely that he has an unresolved DVT. abdominal and head CT are neg for thrombosis.

                                                I sat down for 15 min and felt fine for the rest of the day. The hives started about 30 mins after I had dinner. It started on my shoulders and back, so I took a Benadryl, which was expired. So, I went to get some more and took a second dose around midnight. I won&#39;t up with none, but they were back around noon. That happened for a few days with it happening around lunch and dinner. On Tues, they started spreading more, so I went to the doctor. There was no swelling of the tongue. They lessened over the next couple of days. As of today, I have a small amount of itching, but nothing bad. I&#39;ve also been taking Claritin since yesterday. I have not seen any the same size as before, but I notice that they seem to be worse at night. I took my BP a few times and it was high at those times, but it went back to normal the next day. I will be seeing an allergist in the near future.

Had to go to the emergency room after testing at 183/122. Now with high dosage medications, it&#39;s still high averaging 170/110! With no known catalyst.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  First day after getting the shot I got a feeling of being very tired throughout the day I did not feel like to do anything. Also my arm was very very sore. Even moving it slightly a bit would hurt. The second day is when things got way worse I could not really sleep that well throughout the night because I noticed I had  body aches in my legs and my back. Throughout that day I also felt like I had a fever in the morning I took my temperature and had a 100 fever. At night time I took my temperature and it went up to 102, with  still a bad headache, chills, and body aches throughout my legs mostly. I also felt some palpitations. When I went to bed I was sweating very prefusively all night that I had to change my shirt. On the third day I felt a lot better, still with a slight headache no fever, and still feeling like im sweating on and off.

I parked my vehicle and didn?t feel well so I switched seats with my girl friend. As soon as I got into the passenger seat I was out. She said My eyes rolled back in my head and I started shaking and eyes at this point she said where going up down and side to side . She ran for help and after about 1-2 minutes I  woke up. I thought I passed out so I instantly put my feet on the dash of my car and the pharmacist gave me water and chocolate milk.  He then checked my heart rate it seemed good  and after 20 minutes he let us go home.

CMA noticed that continued to shake arm after 5 minutes but patient was alert and oriented x 3.  CMA thought the way he was shaking his arm seemed irregular so she advised pt he would be taken to an observation area for further observation.  Half way to the observation area, pt reported to CMA that he was seeing spots and felt like he was going to get sick.  CMA called for help.  Patient experienced a syncopal event just as he made it to the chair.  Several staff was helping to support patient.  Legs were lifted to another chair.  Patient was not responsive for a short time, very diaphoretic, breathing regular and unlabored.  Patients eyes then rolled upward toward the ceiling and patient&#39;s entire body began shaking uncontrollably while staff managed to keep patient from falling to floor from the chair.  Once patient was conscious, he was able to state his name but reported he was very confused and could not think clearly.  He was able to sit upright.  In the meantime while patient was shaking uncontrollably, staff sought urgent care provider to come and see patient.  Patient was then taken over to the urgent care side of the building to evaluate and treat patient.

I got up to go to the bathroom and upon finishing, I felt my heart rate skyrocket and felt faint. I immediately went back to the bed where I lost consciousness. My wife said my eyes were open and my body was rigid. I came too within a minute of that and was breathing heavy and sweating and very fatigued. My wife had called 911 as I was coming back to consciousness. The EMTs checked my vitals and all was normal. They asked if I wanted to go to the hospital, and I said no. My back was extremely sore all day, and I developed small red spots around my eyes. I went to my doctor later that day and told them about it. They took my blood for tests, which I have not heard back about, and they did not conclude anything, but did set me up with an appointment for an MRI of my head, given my past history.

For about 30 minutes I saw a white spot on the peripheral  view of my left eye.  By Monday, I felt dizzy and bottom right part of my chest hurt when taking deep breaths. The dizziness and chest pain lasted all week, still feel feel it today 4-18. My doctors office told me vertigo was a common side effect. On Thursday 4-15 every time I bent down and tried to get up, my right leg hurt as if I had exercised. At the moment I haven?t gone into work since Monday 4/12 since my job requires a lot of physical work.  I have mostly been home  resting  but don?t feel ready to go back to work. If someone  calls can it be a Spanish speaking person please.

He received the J&amp;J covid vaccine on 4/8 and felt well afterwards. Last Friday (4/16) he began to experience constitutional symptoms (fever to 100.4, chills, night sweats feeling drenched, decreased appetite) so decided to get his labs drawn as an outpatient for further evaluation. Symptoms progressed until Tuesday, when they began to subside slightly. At that point, his labs resulted and were notable for thrombocytopenia. He got his labs redrawn the day before admission and it was noted that his thrombocytopenia was worsening, so he was directed to the ED for further evaluation.  Patient seen by hematology, started on dexamethasone 40 mg PO daily as well as IVIG treatment x2. MRV of brain without evidence of dural venous sinus thrombosis  ***PATIENT CURRENTLY HOSPITALIZED***

                                                I was feverish, felt nauseous, and then passed out twice. My partner called the doctor who advised us to go to the ER. At the ER I passed out again.

                                                After vaccination, patient appeared to be slouched over in chair in observation area.  Two bystanders approached him and held him to prevent him from falling from his chair. Patient was diaphoretic and eyes half-closed. Attempt was made to arouse patient by talking to him and rubbing chest. His head and body moved erratically for approx. 3 seconds.  Patient was lowered to the floor. Nurse continued speaking to patient and rubbing his chest.  He then opened his eyes and was startled. Patient abruptly sat up and said, ?what happened and where is my phone?? The nurse reassured him he was being taken care of and she asked if he knew where he was?  Patient replied, ?I have no idea.?  A paramedic approached and asked the patient if he knew his name.  The patient correctly replied. The patient had no recollection of what had taken place, but did know where he was. Patient was then evaluated by the paramedics.  All tests performed were normal and patient refused to be transported to hospital.  Patient was driven home by his wife.  Follow up phone call to patient yesterday evening with no answer.  Follow up phone call to wife (listed as emergency contact), 4/7 at approx. 6 pm.  Per wife, patient experiencing fatigue and still very pale. She said he just wasn?t himself. Patient was concerned that they did not know what to expect a week or two from now.   I advised patient that if she had concerns, she needed to have patient evaluated in ER.

I recovered well enough to drive home within 15 minutes afterwards. That night (10pm) I began shivering, which escalated to periods of convulsions, to which a mouth guard was needed to prevent chipping teeth and/or biting my tongue. There was no fever present, and to subside the uncontrollable shivering I sat in a very hot shower until motor functions gradually returned. Periods of headaches, joint pains and sweating ensued for the remainder of the night. There were no other symptoms in the following days.

                                                BLOOD CLOTS IN LEFT LUNG; TIRED; FEVERISH; This spontaneous report received from a consumer concerned a 34 year old male. The patient&#39;s weight was 175 pounds, height was 67 inches and Body mass index (NR: not provided) 27.4. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included non smoker, no personal or family history of clotting disorders and no recent trauma or travel. The patient was active and ran for 30 mins every day. The patient received COVID-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of administration not reported, batch number: 043AZ1A or 043A21A) frequency one total, dose was not reported, administered on 05-APR-2021 at 10:15 hours in left arm for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 05-APR-2021 in the evening, the patient experienced &#34;normal side effects&#34;, specifically tiredness and fever (temperature was not taken) and he took 2 Advil and went to bed. On 06-APR-2021 in the morning, he felt back to his normal baseline. On an unspecified date of APR-2021 (08-APR-2021 or 09-APR-2021), he felt pain and tightness in his chest and difficulty breathing. He noticed that he had to work harder to do his daily run. On 13-APR-2021, when the symptoms did not improve, he went to the emergency room. The patient had blood was taken (results not reported). A computerised tomography (CT) scan showed 2 blood clots in the left lung and duplex scans of both legs did not reveal a clot. A chest x-ray was done but results not provided. The patient&#39;s COVID-19 test was negative, and he was admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous heparin. It was reported that no oxygen was given. On 14-APR-2021, he was discharged with Eliquis which he should continue for 6 months.  On 16-APR-2021, the chest pain was gone, and his breathing was better in the morning but still difficult later in the day. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from tired, and feverish, and was recovering from blood clots in left lung. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This 34 year-old overweight male (BMI 27.4) was hospitalized for 2 blood clots in his left lung 8 days after receiving vaccination with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. He had no chronic medical conditions, was a nonsmoker, no personal or family history of clotting disorders, no recent trauma or travel, and exercised every day. On the evening of his vaccination, he felt tired and fever (temperature not taken) and took 2 ibuprofen and went to bed. The following morning, he felt back to normal. Two or three days later, he felt pain/tightness in his chest and difficulty breathing; he found it more difficult to perform his daily exercise. Eight days after vaccination, when his symptoms did not improve, he went to the emergency department where a CT scan showed 2 blood clots in his left lung. Covid-19 testing and duplex scans of his legs were negative. Blood tests were performed but results were unknown. He was hospitalized for 1 night, treated with IV heparin, and discharged the following day with apixaban. As of the time of this report, the chest pain had resolved and breathing was improved in the morning but still difficult later in the day. Based on the limited information (e.g. absence of blood test results), the relationship with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine is considered indeterminant.

I Went to bed and woke up at 16:25. 30 min later I slept again for about 90 min. Then I woke up and walked outside for some fresh air and got this extreme ice pick pain in the left side of my head for a few seconds. Then a few seconds later again. Now it just nags a bit behind my left eye and it feels a bit off in the left side of my brain. Bright lights hurt a bit. My back pain and Sciatica is also a lot higher than normal.

T&#43; 2 days - 7 days: fever subsides, hot flashes increase in intensity significantly, continuing to interfere with sleep. Other possible androgenic symptoms begin to arise: change in body odor, sex drive, motivations, appetite. T&#43; 7 days till current: previous symptoms of days 2-7 continue, extremely gradual onset headache begins one night. Making sure to rule out hydration and electrolyte imbalance expecting headache to be gone in the morning after sleep, I found that it was only worse and that an interpolation of the two pain points from when I went to sleep and woke up would have created a almost imperceptibly gradual but linear increase between the two points. The headache was of a type I had never had before, located in the center of my head just barely dorsal to the spinal insertion. It felt deeper than any headache I had had before which usually occur in the frontal lobe/neocortex zone. I do not regularly suffer headaches getting maybe a couple per year. Once I recognized androgenic involvement and the headache were continuing I took myself to the ER where I was evaluated and despite presenting with continuous hypertension and the symptoms mentioned above, I could not get them to perform a estrogen test and they let me leave with hypertension without any investigation. I&#39;m returning today to their urgent care facility to try again to get my estrogen levels checked. I had left a message on the phone line of VAERS prior to the original ER visit but had not heard back from anyone so I felt it was prudent to file a written report here.

                                                Patient felt light-headed, then became unresponsive. He moved both arms halfway up, and they both quivered simultaneously. I called for help. One nurse raised his legs &amp; another put a pulse oximeter on patient &amp; took his BP. Patient started responding to verbal cues. A nurse gave him Gatorade to start drinking. He was drenched in sweat from head to feet. The nurse continued to take his BP, which did hit 120/~70, but then dipped again. Once his BP &amp; pulse stabilized, he was able to go home. Patient ate a full meal &amp; a non-diet soda. He reported being exhausted ~4 pm. He fell asleep &amp; rose once to urinate.  Dr. at a Family Medicine practice checked his heart and lungs, and confirmed this did not appear to be an allergic reaction, but more likely was a vagovasal reaction. Patient started reacting ~10 minutes after the injection.

Patient laid to floor with knees up and hands behind head. The patient came to rather quickly. The EMS squad was called and they took over with blood pressure and portable EKG machine. The patient had a gatorade and rested for about an hour and his wife drove him home. I called him 2 days later to check in on his status and he said he got a good nights sleep and felt much better with just a sore arm.

Everything was normal and I was sent home to monitor.  I continued having chest pain 4/14-4/17.  On 4/17 I was having chest pain and then started having numbness in the left side of my face.  I proceeded to have left sided weakness,  difficulty speaking, slurred speech, and loss of motor skills.  I was taken to the ER.  They did a CT scan, blood work, and an ekg.  All were normal.  I was admitted to the hospital and they did MRI or the head, MRA of the neck, MRI of the neck and spine, Echocardiogram, Stress test, and further blood work.  Everything came back normal.  I saw Neurology inpatient and was discharged to follow up outpatient.  I still have coordination  difficulty and I do not have all of my motor skills back yet.

This is a 35-year-old male with complex past medical history including bilateral lung transplant and renal transplant performed several years ago.  He both of them and regarding his transplant management.  He is on immunosuppressive medications.  He is here today out of concern for exposure to COVID.  He was vaccinated with Johnson Johnson vaccine on  3/4.  He is here cause overnight he started developed fever headache sore throat muscle aches.  If continued through today.  He was test in the outpatient setting but the results have not yet returned.  He is here today with continued symptoms.  He is well-appearing on exam but mildly tachycardic, low-grade temperature here no significant increased work of breathing no conversational dyspnea lungs are clear heart is regular but tachycardic without murmur he has no signs or symptoms of DVT currently.  His chest x-ray shows all isolated left lower lobe infiltrate.  His labs are unremarkable with normal renal function, normal electrolytes but is rapid COVID test is positive.  Given his immunosuppressive status in infiltrate seen on x-ray initially recommended admission for observation even though he is not initially on any supplemental oxygen is work of breathing is quite comfortable.  I was able to discuss with his transplant surgeon In addition I talked to admitting physician who then discussed with pulmonology here .  In their opinion the best management for the patient would be to provide him with the monoclonal antibody treatment but this can only be performed in the outpatient setting given he has no increased work of breathing no supple ox requirement currently that he is stable for discharge.  He has a pulse monitor at home will also enroll him in a COVID home program.  Pulmonology will call him for follow-up tomorrow.  When I discussed with  they currently do not have any beds available at the hospital for transport.  The patient does not want to go to an outside facility that has a transplant team other than the risks of.  Ultimately the patient would like to go home.  I will add doxycycline for bacterial possibility of his pneumonia seen on x-ray today.  He also had very strict return precautions.  He understands likely had a possibility of worsening symptoms understands to return immediately if any new or worsening symptoms or no improvement.  Patient was given the monoclonal antibody treatment in the ER after ordered by Dr..  He will ultimately be discharged with very close follow-up.

He started feeling sick and got up to go to the restroom. On his way to the restroom, he passed out and fell in the hallway. We then got him to a seat and gave him some water and orange juice. The patient was adamant that we not call an ambulance for him, so we made the patient stay seating under our direct supervision. He sat in the waiting room for about an hour until someone could come to pick him up. By the time someone arrived to take him home, he seemed to be doing much better.

There was no blood in my pee or discoloration however I had to clean my penis tip with a tissue and noticed a blood cloth came out while I was wiping. This concerns me but that was the only time I saw blood, there was none afterward nor has it occur since then.

                                                Patient went to the hospital Monday.  He received the Janssen single-dose Covid vaccine on Thursday, April 8 and by Saturday, April 10 he was starting to develop fairly significant peripheral edema without any breathing  difficulties.  This  persisted and was worse by Monday, April 13  EKG showed global nonspecific T-wave abnormalities and ST segment changes so I had him sent to the ER. As it turned out he had a pancytopenia (mostly neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) so he was admitted to the hospital. This seemed to resolve pretty much on its own and so they attributed everything to his hepatitis C. Indeed his LFTs are elevated in the 300 range and imaging showed  hepatosplenomegaly.  they also did a bone marrow biopsy for which there are no results yet

                                                Received J&#43;J Covid vaccine on 4/3/21. Admitted on 4/19. Per admission note: Patient is a 36YO male with a history of HFrEF s/p heartware 12/17/14, ICM with embolic MI, CAD, chronic driveline infection, HTN, HLD, DM type II, SVT, obesity, gout who was sent to the hospital for bilateral PEs. Patient called our OP line on 04/17 complaining of fever of 102 and chills. He was instructed to go to local lab and get labs done. They drew basic labs as well as blood cultures. On Sunday, the patient reported his fever was gone and he felt better. Today, he was feeling SOB and presented to his PCP. They ordered a CTA which reportedly showed bilateral PEs. They sent him to the local ED who transferred him here. Of note, his INR has been supratherapeutic for several weeks and pharmacy has been adjusting his warfarin dosing. The patient tested COVID negative prior to transfer. The vaccine lot number information is not accessible to this reporter.

                                                Patient came in for Janssen COVID vaccine that was scheduled electronically online.  All appropriate prescreening was done and patient had no previous allergies or issues.  Patient was instructed to sit in one of the chairs designated for post vaccine observation.  Within minutes (less than 3), patient was very dizzy, clammy (cold sweats), pale and said he did not feel right.  I assisted him to a sitting position on the floor from his chair and we were able to ease him back to a lying down position from there with his head on the floor and feet elevated above heart on a chair.  Patient said that the cold floor actually made him feel better instantly.  At 4:18pm after lying down for about 3 minutes we checked his blood pressure with him still lying down.  It was 110/88 and pulse of 104 (so slightly elevated pulse).  He said he was feeling better and we kept him lying down.  Patient&#39;s wife was also there so she was able to provide information in addition to him doing it also.  She did state that he occasionally had panic attacks and she thought this might be one, the patient was adamant that it was not.  At 4:24 pm we checked his blood pressure again and it was 100/90 and Pulse of 104.  He was feeling quite a bit better so we had him come to a sitting position on the floor and he had not eaten in a while so we got him a granola bar and water.  Pt slowly ate these and begin to feel clammy and sweaty again within 3-4 minutes. We checked his blood pressure again and it was 104/90 and pulse of 100.  He wanted to stay sitting to see if it would pass.  We did continuously observe injection site and screen for any other symptoms of an allergic reaction (nausea, cramping, swelling, and none of these were occurring). Since he was still not feeling well we gave the patient 50mg of benadryl (20 mls of 12.5mg/5ml liquid benadryl) with his approval. After about 10 minutes of sitting total he was still having cold sweats and feeling dizzy so we had him lie back on his back with his feet elevated while the benadryl kicked in.  By 4:50pm he was feeling well enough to sit back up and we got him some wraps and a coke from the cafe to eat.  Pt continued to consistently improve and was ready to leave about 5:20pm.  We advised him and his wife of signs and symptoms of allergic reaction and to have those treated to immediately at urgent care or and ER.   We also told him to follow-up with his PCP.  I had a manager help walk them to their car.  They were very kind and grateful.  I will follow-up with a call tomorrow and again on Friday to make sure he continues to do well.

                                                Seven days after vaccine was administered Patient started having symptoms of difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, and breaking out in a rash all over  his torso and upper arms.  His lips also got quite swollen.  The rash eventually spread down both his legs.  He was taken to the emergency room at Hospital, as he was visiting there at the time.  He was given benadryl, and prednisone once his Covid test came back negative.  Blood work, chest x-ray, CT scan of both stomach and chest, EKG and blood work all came back normal.  His resting heart rate was 120 and above, and he required two liters of oxygen to stay in the mid 90&#39;s saturation level.  He spent five days in the hospital before the rash was mostly faded on his torso and his lip swelling had come down.  He was discharged on 3/24/21 with the advice to see his primary care physician, and to be monitored carefully for oxygen saturation and heart rate.  The family could not think of anything he had eaten or come in contact with that would have caused any reaction.  At this time we think it was a reaction to his Janssen vaccine based on all the tests at the hospital coming back normal.

                                                JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE EUA  I received the vaccine on 3rd April, 2021, at approximately 9:30 am. There were no immediate side effects. Approximately 10 hours later I began to feel EXTREME cold and chills. So much so that I had to put on 3 layers of clothing, socks and cover myself with 3-4 blankets. I also experienced a fever and body soreness. My wife tended to me with two ibuprofen tablets, 200 mg each and continually to put cold presses on my forehead. I drank a lot of water but my fever continued to spike to 102.8. The symptoms continued for another 3 hours. Out of concern we called the emergency room to ask if we should be concerned about the fever. We were advised to take two Tylenol tablets. My wife gave me two Tylenol PM tablets. About 30 mins after taking the Tylenol tablets and continuing to hydrate, my cold and chills began to subside and I began to shed all of my layers. About 30 minutes after that, my fever levelled out to abougt 100.8. Then I passed out. The following morning, I woke up with cold, chills and fever gone. I had a mild headache and took 2 Extra Strength Tylenol tablets. It&#39;s been four hours since then and I feel fine, just a little weak.

                                                patient got his vaccine, put his shirt back on and buttoned it up and asked if it should be sore already.  I told him, yes the shot may cause some discomfort after injection and he was standing at this point.  He was about to say something and he fell backwards and hit a mobile laptop cart and the wall.  The patient went unconscious not talking but breathing was given an epipen and 911 called vaccine given a few minutes before 12:30 and 911 called at 12:29.  He regained consciousness fairly quickly and was assessed by the pharmacist and then EMT and transported to the hospital for monitoring.

The pharmacist approached the patient, who was then reporting that his heart was racing, he was having hot flashes, and felt faint. His blood pressure was 151/106 and HR 116. Emergency services were contacted; EKG was normal and patient did not need to report to hospital for further care. Patient felt better approximately 45  minutes post vaccination and left at that time.

About 3-4 minutes after his vaccine, he slumped over in the chair and was unresponsive. The pharmacist and store manager stayed with him as a technician called 911. He was unresponsive for about 30 seconds before he came to but then continued to go in and out of consciousness for the next couple of minutes. He said he had a history of dizziness after vaccines. When he was finally able to hold a conversation with us, he said he felt hot and we gave him a cold bottle to put on his head until the paramedics arrived. His blood pressure was 100/50 when the paramedics arrived about 7-10 minutes after we called and patient was fully responsive then. Paramedics continued to monitor him and followed him home to make sure he was okay.

                                                I woke up 7 days after receiving the vaccine with shooting sharp pains across my abdominal / midsection. While attempting to go to the bathroom, I must have passed out because I woke up some time later on the floor with a busted face and nose, and a severe headache.  Initially the day after the shot, I had sharp shooting pains down my right leg. I have also had a headache on more days since getting the vaccine.  Mental fog and tiredness is also occurring a few days after the initial shot.

                                                I fainted the following evening after my vaccination. I felt fine all day and after dinner started to feel flush, vision became blurry and had trouble hearing. Within 3 minutes I fainted. Felt fine after coming to, and have felt fine so far the next day.

                                                On Saturday 3/20 I experienced the usual symptoms that were noted. On Monday 3/22 I began to get very dizzy with a heart rate of 150bpm. My blood pressure went up to 210/138 which is extremely abnormal for me. I began to tremor uncontrollably. I thought it was an anxiety attack so I took my Xanax. .50mg. That did not work at all. I experienced nausea and stomach pain. I called 911 and was taken to the hospital where after 4 hours I started feeling better. Tuesday I continued to have tremors. Wednesday the rapid heart rate, stomach pain, and nausea returned. The rest of the week did not get any better. On Saturday 3/27 I slept all day long which again is not normal for me at all. At this point we are 1 full week into the vaccine administration. On Sunday 3/28 I bagan to have the same feeling as the prior Tuesday. Sweating, couldn&#39;t breath, heart rate hit 170 this time. BP was the same, tremors, stomach pain, nausea, dizzyness, and this time my Carbon Dioxide level dropped to 24. This morning 3/29 I woke up with extreme tremors. No dizzyness.

                                                Approximately ten minutes after receiving the vaccination I got very dizzy and passed out. I was out for 3-4 minutes and came to. Subsequent to passing out I vomited a few times and could not hold anything down. I also urinated on myself at some point when out. I was not getting better so 911 was called and I was transported to the emergency room via ambulance. Once the ambulance arrived at the hospital I vomited again filling about half of the vomit bag. I arrived at the hospital and an IV was not able to be administered so I was given Zofran for nausea and Gatorade to try and hold down. I spent approximately 4 hours in the ER, was able to finally get to the point where the nausea calmed down and I was able to walk around. I was then discharged.

                                                While sitting down during the post-vaccination period, patient asked his wife for water about 10 minutes after receiving vaccine. Pharmacy staff provided water and pharmacist went over to check on the patient. Patient expressed feeling &#34;hot&#34; and wanted an ice-pack, which was given. Patient expressed feeling &#34;faint,&#34; after which he briefly lost consciousness. Pharmacist immediately started checking for pulse and obtained Emergency Kit. Patient regained consciousness quickly without need of CPR or administration of Emergency Kit medications. At some point patient also released his bladder,  most likely during the syncope episode. Patient expressing feeling &#34;nauseous&#34; and asked for something to throw up in. Pharmacist quickly got a trash can and gave to patient, shortly after which patient started vomiting. Pharmacist was attending to patient and asked patient if he wanted 911 to be called, to which he replied &#34;No&#34; and that he just needed some time to sit. Patient also stated he did not eat much that day. Pharmacist offered Pedialyte, to which patient agreed, in order to replenish fluids/electrolytes lost due to vomiting. Patient also asked for some crackers since he did not eat much earlier. After taking sips of Pedialyte and taking bites of crackers, patient could not hold anything down and continued to vomit. At that time patient&#39;s wife asked pharmacy staff to proceed with calling 911. 911 was called and paramedics took patient&#39;s vitals upon arrival at the scene. Vitals were all stated to be normal. Patient agreed to be taken by ambulance to the hospital. A couple hours later patient&#39;s wife informed pharmacy staff that patient was doing much better and was expected to be released from hospital soon. Before receiving vaccination, patient did share that in the past he had &#34;felt faint&#34; when giving blood but it was not made clear that patient had felt faint or fainted during vaccinations prior. After the incident patient&#39;s wife confirmed that patient had fainted in the past both after giving blood and after receiving vaccinations. Pharmacist called patient at 9:12 AM the following day (4/3/21) to see how patient was doing but was only able to leave a voicemail message.

I felt nauseous and thought I would vomit, but didn&#39;t and believe I lost consciousness again. I was able to make it to the sink to try to wash my hands, and I fell down on my knees. I knew I was bleeding somewhere but didn&#39;t know from where (my right pinky was cut on an item in the bathroom when I fell). My wife made it to me, and I lost consciousness a couple more times while talking with her. I laid on the bathroom floor for a

                                                Patient began feeling light headed within the 15 minute observation period post-vaccination. Of note, patient states he had not had anything to eat all day and only had some coffee. Paramedics onsite took vitals which were, BP 98/60, Pulse 50 bpm, O2 100%. Patient noted that he was an active runner, but stats were not typical. Paramedics noted that patient was ?very pale? and was still light headed 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine. After consultation with paramedics and patient, it was agreed to transport because of low vitals and no change in status. Patient was transported to local hospital and because of transport protocols, an IV of 90% NaCL was started.

                                                Hi I was vaccinated Thursday April 8th 2021 at approximately 9:15am. I kept a log so I could share my experience with my friends and family. After vaccination I was fine for a few hours but I randomly got a case of  watery eyes that would last about 15 minutes and then clear up. This happened 4 times over a 9 hour period. Around 9 hours after vaccination I started to feel like I had a cold and my skin all over my body ached to touch and my heart started racing. I felt sunburned and nauseous and went to bed. 13 hours exactly after vaccination I was hit hard with intense chills to the point of teeth chattering and full body shivering. 15 hours after injection I woke up intensely hot and I had a massive headache, full body pain, a tickle deep in my lungs that made me cough, nausea, and a fever of 101. I also was having extreme heart palpitations. I have a laser thermometer and I discovered my fever was 101.5 at my forehead but my neck and chest were 103. I took ibuprofen and kept patting myself with cold wet wash cloths to combat the fever. At this point I debated going to the hospital. I had intense fatigue and I was too weak to move but too sick to sleep. This level of fever and symptoms went on for about a day and a half. Since my vaccination I am still fatigued, I get winded very easily, something small like feeding my dog makes me break out in a sweat, and I need to lay down. I am still weak and fatigued but not to the same level as before and it changes every day. I have a sore throat, headaches, occasionally my body will twitch in random places, fever will pop up and go away, I cough gag and get very weak under any physical stress. I did not have injection site pain out of the ordinary until 48 hours after injection and it felt like a shotgun blast to the arm.. I did have very unusual joint pain from the start. I was injected in my upper left arm, but my lower right ankle was painful and my left wrist...    I am a 38 year old male with treated hypertension, obesity and sleep apnea. My mother who is 65 was vaccinated at the same time as myself and her symptoms were slow onset and much milder than mine but she too has headaches, upset stomach, fatigue, watery eyes, fever, chills, twitches, injection pain, etc.

Rph had reviewed information on consent form including whether he had had any adverse effects to a vaccine that required immediate medical care. His notation on the consent form and verbal information provided to rph prior to injection was no. Immediately after the injection is when he said he should have mentioned that he has fainted in the past when receiving an immunization. EMS was contacted to assess patient and whether it was safe for him to leave pharmacy. EPS monitored blood pressure and other vitals and patient said he felt well enough to leave on his own after 30 minutes observation by rph

                                                Flu like symptoms with severe stabbing chest pain. Started to feel achy and a twinge in chest around 12:30 am, went to sleep, woke up at 2 am with severe stabbing pains in chest that would come and go. Took some Advil around 3:15am and within a half hour flu like symptoms stopped but not chest pains. The chest pain were less severe. Continues to feel a  slight twinge and slight aching in chest 4 days later.

Counseled the patient on potential reactions and how the chills may be due to a low grade fever, insomnia/HR due to anxiety about potential side effects. Patient asked about the ability to get paid time off while recuperating from the vaccination, he was referred to the HR department. Patient reports that he called Vsafe and VAERS. He was going to talk to personnel at the end of the conversation at the pharmacy.

THE VACCINE WAS GIVEN WITHOUT INCIDENT AND PATIENT SAID HE FELT OK. HE TRADED PLACES WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AND SAT IN A CHAIR IN THE EXAM ROOM. IT WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER I HAD ALREADY GIVEN HIS GIRLFRIEND HER VACCINE THAT HE SAID THAT HE WAS FEELING FUNNY. HIS COLORING CHANGED AND HE WAS DIAPHORETIC. I GOT A PAPERTOWEL WITH COOL WATER ON IT AND PLACED ON HIS NECK AND ANOTHER ONE FOR HIS FOREHEAD. AFTER A MINUTE OR SO, HE DID PASS OUT WHILE IN THE CHAIR. HE WAS OUT FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS AND THEN CAME BACK TO AND WAS ALERT AND ORIENTED X 4 BUT STILL FELT VERY WEAK. I GAVE HIM A WATER TO SIP ON. HIS GIRLFRIEND STAYED AT HIS SIDE THE WHOLE TIME. HIS O2 WAS 100% AND HIS PULSE 53. HE SAID THAT HE HAD EATEN SHORTLY BEFORE COMING TO GET HIS VACCINE BUT THEN LATER ASKED FOR AN APPLE BECAUSE HE WAS ON A CLEANSE DIET AND REALLY HAD NOT EATTEN MUCH. THE PCT WENT TO GET HIM AN APPLE. AFTER EATING THE APPLE AND SITTING FOR AN ADDITIONAL 20 MIN HE FELT WELL ENOUGH TO LEAVE. STILL WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AND HIS GIRLFRIEND COMMITTED TO DRIVING HIM SO HE DID NOT HAVE TO. HE LEFT WITH NO ASSISTANCE.

                                                Pt had history of anaphylaxis related to bee stings. We asked if he had ever had a reaction to another vaccine and he said no. Pt came up saying he wasn&#39;t feeling well during the observation period, within about 5-10 minutes after receiving the vaccination. He look very pale and clammy. I asked if he was ok and he shook his head. Tried to grab a chair for him and he started to collapse. With some help I was able to get him to the ground without injury. We called 911 and I grabbed an epipen. I tried to assess the patient, and he was unable to tell me if he was having any trouble breathing or if his lips/mouth/tongue was swelling. He was conscious but couldn&#39;t speak coherently. I administered the epipen to his right lateral thigh due to his history of anaphylaxis with bee stings. We were able to lay him down while waiting for the ambulance. His color started to return and he was able to respond to questions, but was still slightly confused. He did tell me at this point that he has had similar reactions after vaccines and blood work. The paramedics arrived and took the patients vitals and took him to the hospital.

I looked at my toes and noticed they were turning very pale.

It was shocking and looked like I had stepped in yellow paint.

Went into the Pagosa Medical Group Urgent Care the next day to get checked out.  EKG came back normal.  Doc and I both thought it was gas, but we wanted to be sure it wasn&#39;t heart related.

At around 2am April 11 I went to use the bathroom and blacked out. My wife found me on the floor and was able to rouse me. Went to the ER with severe stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea, severe headache, fever, high pulse of 120-140bpm. Pulse dropped to 108bpm by the time i got to te hospital. Hospital administered Zofran for my gastro issues and ran an EKG. We waited 3&#43; hours and never saw a doctor and was never even taken back in the ER. We left due to staff and patients in the waiting room not wearing respirators or masks or even basic sanitary precautions or separation of patients with Covid symptoms from other patients.

                                                Within a few minutes of receiving the vaccination I lost consciousness. It was a drive-through vaccination clinic by the Health department. My vehicle rolled into a cement and metal bar/side of the building&#39;s exit at a slow speed. The EMS at the scene stated that my heartbeat was irregular, varying between bradycardia and tachycardia. When they checked my blood pressure inside the ambulance they stated it was very low. About 15-20 minutes later I tried to sit up and was still unstable and unable to keep myself upright without assistance. I was then taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital&#39;s emergency department. Nothing notable or unusual was found when I was checked out there. Within a couple hours I felt well enough to go home. Once home I had a headache, fatigue, mild dizziness, and nausea with physical activity. The following day I had a headache, muscle aches, pain at the injection site, and nausea with extended physical activity. Today I have pain in the arm where I received the vaccine and a mild headache.

                                                Monday, April 12th, around 2pm I started to develop extreme stomach pain, as well as noticed some shortness of breath or elevated heart rate. The stomach pain worsened after dinner. I  assumed it was something I ate, which was the same thing I eat every day, and expected it was some type of gas that would resolve itself naturally. I went to bed in lots of pain. I didn&#39;t sleep well due to the issues and woke up still in pain in my mid stomach, mostly on the left side. I called the nurse who did an intake and advised that I go to the ER (Tuesday, April 13th)

I then fell backwards, and began having a seizure. Bystander said my eyes got huge and mouth and tongue turned blue as I couldn?t breathe. I had a seizure for about 5-8 minutes and was totally blacked out. During the seizure I lost control of my bladder and dislocated my jaw.
