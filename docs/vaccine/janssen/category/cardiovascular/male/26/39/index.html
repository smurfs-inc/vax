After awaking he doesn&#39;t remember the last 5 minutes. He laid down to go to sleep and was consistently hot and then cold. He does have a history of night terrors but they have remained dormant for about 2.5 years. Around 12 am he started having one of the worst night terrors I&#39;ve seen. The following morning, April 2nd 2021, he was feeling incredibly sore and the injection spot was tender. He said &#34;it feels like I got hit by a truck.&#34; Seems to be doing okay otherwise now.

When he came to, he was totally aware of his surroundings and answered all of our questions. We had called 911 in the mean time. EMt&#39;s checked him thoroughly. His apple watch showed his pulse dropped to 42. EMT&#39;s stayed for about 15 minutes, We gave him water and his wife stayed within reach of him.  We escorted him to his car in one of our wheel chairs after about half hour.

About 5 minutes after vaccination, another patient came over and said that was not feeling well. When going out to patient I noticed he was very pale and sweating.  The patient then proceeded to pass out. I was able to hold the patients head and the other customer was able to hold his shoulders to make sure he did not fall out of the chair. The patient then got very stiff and proceeded to push back in his chair, after about 10 seconds he relaxed. The patient was passed out for about 3 mins, during that time I was able to remove his mask and hold his head. After gaining consciousness, I was able to make sure he was ok. We were able to give him some water and he stated he felt better. I asked the patient to stay for another half hour to monitor. After giving the patient another bottle of water, and having him sit he was able to get up and leave.

                                                Only minor chills before bed, 11pm. Muscle aches, felt as tightness in IT bands, made remaining asleep difficult. Got up to use the bathroom around 5am. Upon finishing peeing while standing, I lost consciousness, falling. As a result of the fall, I fractured my cheek bone, cut open my ear, later requiring three stitches, and was concussed, resulting in a loss of memory. I was nonresponsive when my fiance found me immediately following the crash, and was rushed to the hospital  via ambulance. Upon arrival to the hospital, my fever was found to be 102 F. As a result of the fall, I have a cheek bone fracture, three stiches in my ear, and a concussion.

I went back and checked on him after 5mins of waiting, then came back to the pharmacy. But heard a big bang shortly after. Some how, he had fallen out of his chair and bumped his head and neck on an end camp. He seemed a little confused, when I ran over, but was awake, a little sweaty and nauseated. EMS was called. They transported him to ER to have his head checked, since he bumped it.

                                                The patient was nervous prior to vaccine and had a needle phobia. About 5 minutes post-vaccine, the patient stated he was not feeling well and feeling warm and sweaty. The pharmacy staff provided the patient with water and an ice pack. The patient stated he was feeling faint. The patient fainted for about 20 seconds and then became conscious again. The patient didn&#39;t have any injuries and didn&#39;t fall down. The patient was okay and he laid down and elevated his feet on a chair. He then stated that he has severe needle phobia and has fainted several times in the past with vaccine administration and blood draws. He had experienced this in the past. He was still slightly faint and requested that he be checked out. The EMT arrived and they took his vitals and checked him. By the time the EMT arrived, he was beginning to feel better and had sat up and drinking water. There were no further issues. The EMT stated he was good to head home. We followed up with patient and the patient was feeling good with no further issues.

                                                I received the J&amp;J vaccine at 10:00am on March 18, 2021 at the Community Center. By about 5:00pm, I started to feel minor flu-like symptoms, but as the night progressed it got significantly worse. Around 8-9pm, I was bedridden with the worst chills/shaking I&#39;ve ever experienced in my life. Around 9:30-10:00pm, I was filling water at my sink and projectile vomitted multiple times into the sink and could not make it to the bathroom. Subsequently, I ate a bagel and drank lots of water, knowing my vomitting could make me dehydrated. Throughout the night, I was awake and shaking, and drank and filled my water bottle repeatedly. At 8:00am, I was filling my water, and without my knowledge of awareness, fainted on my kitchen floor, dropping the Brita filter and likely hitting my head. My roommate heard the commotion and saw me passed out in our kitchen. He tried to wake me up and I phased in, but then subsequently phased out again 20-30 seconds later as I was trying to stand and likely hit my head again. My roommate eventually got me over to our couch and called EMTs. Upon their arrival, EMTs checked my pulse, which was fine, and saw an open laceration on the back of my head, so they took me to Hospital to access the Trauma Center. On the way, I threw up repeatedly and was very lightheaded. Upon my arrival at Hospital, I was checked for any neck bone breaks, given an IV, a CT  scan, an EKG, and staples were placed in the back of my head to heal the laceration. After my release, I was bedridden for 2-3 days and required a daily nap during work (1-2) hours for the next 1 1/2 to 2 weeks. For a while, everything was fine, but recently during the first two weeks of April, it has become apparent that my head is foggy and reacts to changes in the weather, which leads me to believe that I likely banged my head pretty good when I fainted those two times.

Then he felt like he fell asleep until the person checking him called at him.  He had some vision and hearing impairment at the beginning, then after 10 minutes he was better. His arm was hot, he was sweating, his skin was turning white color.  His mom came (she was shopping) and said the patient is usually an anxious person, so it was overwhelming to be at department store and getting the shot.  After another 10 minutes, he was drinking water, his senses were back, he was fine.

                                                I asked the patient how he felt after the injection and he said that he felt a little lightheaded and nauseous.  He said he had a little too much to drink last night because his buddies were moving West.  I asked him to lay on the floor but he refused.  He said, &#34;I just want to sit for a while&#34;.  Within minutes the patient turned pale and started twitching. I asked another pharmacist to help to move him to the ground.  911 was called while patient was on the ground lying sideways because I was afraid that he may choke on his vomit.  In a few minutes, patient sat up and asked for a bucket to throw up in.  The Fire department came and took his blood pressure  (BP120/?) and asked him some questions. They his blood pressure was good and advised him not to drive home.  They helped him to get back on the chair. He stayed in the vaccination booth for us to keep an eye out until his friend showed up to take him home (30 minutes later). We had a male associate escort him out because he said he was still nauseous.

I realized he had passed out . I held his arm and said his name he immediately jerked awake and did not know where he was or what he was doing.  He drank some Gatorade and ate a couple of chocolate kisses.  He began to have cold sweats that lasted a few minutes.  I sat with him in counseling room for 15 minutes and then he sat in waiting room  until he felt better.  He did not feel that he needed further attention or medical assistance.

I quickly grabbed an ice pack and placed it behind his neck to keep him awake. He started leaning forward and told me he is loosing his vision. He leaned forward and I had to support his chest with my arm all the while trying to talk to him. He dropped his phone and wallet on the floor. He seemed to be loosing conciousness. I had an epinephrine 0.3 mg in my hand but because he was speaking I did not inject him. After about 20 seconds he started gaining his vision back but he said his vision is still fuzzy. After about 2 minutes he felt better so I asked him to position himself at the blood pressure machine. It was 86/65. He does not take any medications or has any health issues. After 10 minutes he took blood pressure again and it was around 129/91. He used the restaurant during the 10 m inute break.

This continued for about 1 week. I still have occasional pain, particularly in the legs, made worse by exercise (lighter exercise than would normally cause pan). I have also been experiencing hypertension that, to my knowledge, did not exist prior to receiving the vaccine. This has persisted since first measured 5 days after the vaccine until today, more than a month after receiving it.

                                                Patient has a history of dizziness with shots, so they elected to get the Johnson and Johnson shot so that they would only need one shot. Patient received the vaccine in the counseling area, and the shot itself went as usual. About 15-45 seconds after the shot the patient stated that they began to feel dizzy. The patient then tried to lower himself to the floor. As soon as he started, he lost consciousness and fell forward out of his chair. He got some carpet burn in the area surrounding his eye. About a dime sized area above and a quarter sized area below. His head also mildly bumped against the wall. As soon as he passed out, 911 was called as a precaution. He was responsive within the minute, stating he was fine. He lost consciousness soon after for about 30 seconds before becoming responsive again. He was able to hold a conversation upon awakening. Patient states this is normal for him to experience. He has some discomfort with the carpet burns but reported no pain from bumping the top of the head. We offered some Neosporin for the carpet burns but patient stated that medication smells can sometimes make him dizzy, so we did not use any. We did provide him with some bandages for the area. I advised him to wash the area with soap and water at home. We kept him in the pharmacy for a half hour keeping conversation with him to make sure he was all right. He was able to stand on his own without issue after 25 minutes, he did not have any issues with dizziness at this point. After the wait and with patient being back to baseline, they wanted to get home and proceeded to go home. Before they left, I did verify that he was not the one driving home. Ii advised them to seek any medical attention if he has any further such issues. Patient came back after about 45 minutes asking what to use to clean wound. I recommended Neosporin, we did provide patient with both Neosporin and rubbing alcohol.

                                                On 04/04/21, around 11 AM, the customer walked in for his COVID vaccine appointment.  After registering for the vaccine , the patient sat in the designated area and one of our immunizing technicians administered the vaccine while I was observing and I left the immunization area while my technician was finishing up cleaning. When the patient asked the immunizing technician a question about side effects, she offered him to talk to the pharmacist at the consultation window. While I was assisting the next customer, I heard a loud sound and saw the customer collapsing on the floor. I ran outside and checked his pulse, and asked to call 911. He was conscious and breathing. I went inside the pharmacy to get EpiPen and informed the customer that I will be administering EpiPen, but he denied it. In the meantime, the immunizing technician was already on hold with 911 and informed that they are on the way. The customers in the waiting area also kept him engaged and were watching him if he is alert. The store manager on duty was also in the pharmacy area. I came inside the pharmacy and offered the patient a chair to sit in. Paramedics arrived in a few minutes to transport him to the hospital. The patient came back to the pharmacy around 2:30PM to collect his immunization card and when I inquired about how he is doing, the patient informed me that he is feeling more better and the ER determined that there was no allergic reaction to the vaccine but the patient most likely stood up too quickly after the vaccine was administered.

Since the event i have been feeling slightly fatigued and i have a slight feverish feeling, but in general have been able to rest and have not had a repeat occurrence. I received no medical attention or treatment.

Could not stand, very dizzy, tried to sleep through it. I threw up around 11 and did so a couple more times after that. Was finally able to sleep and woke up feeling much better. Arm is still sore at the injection point.

                                                I gave the vaccine around 6:20pm after counseling on possible adverse reactions and going over the patient&#39;s questions. I then asked them to wait 15min. Within 5-10mins the patient got up and came back to our counter saying he thinks he&#39;s having a reaction. I pulled him back into our vaccination area and had him sit down and explain what he was feeling to me. He looked pale and told me he felt dizzy, sweaty, shaky, &amp; nauseous. He wanted me to grab him a bag incase he puked. I grabbed a bag as well as water and Benadryl. I asked if he was having any issues breathing or if it felt like his tongue was swollen at all. He said no issues breathing and tongue felt fine.  He started to feel better within about 10-15 minutes after onset. He did not puke and his color returned. I had him wait an additional 10-15 minutes after that to make sure we were recovered. I asked him if there was anything else going on and he mentioned that he hadn&#39;t slept well the night before and that he had barely eaten today. He also mentioned he can get anxiety. I told him all of those factors could certainly contribute to what he just experienced but that I would be reporting this on to be safe.

                                                On day 1 (April 15) of noticing my body was very off after the vaccine I had Leg pain and severe headaches, I say severe because though I rarely get headaches and stay hydrated I could tell this headache really hurt and lasted the full day and several days after (something I have never had happen to me) Also on April 15, I had leg pain, If I took a step off a few inches curb or stair step I felt sharp pain shoot up my leg. On April 16th I still had the headaches and leg pain , but also while driving I began loosing my vision and started to pass out/faint. I Pulled over and waited at least a half hour. during that time I. noticed I couldn&#39;t type or read anything on my phone as I was trying to reach a friend to help me. eventually after time had passed I was able to drive myself to a friends where I thought the best thing would be to sleep it off. the headaches and leg pain lasted a couple more days and I thought it was going to go away, but it is now May 5th and today and last couple days the leg pain feels more like someone has been punching my left leg. five had chest pain and headaches return. I do not have medical insurance and have avoided going to the hospital or primary care because I am afraid. today the pain is so irritating and sore I wish I could escape my body.

I sat him down immediately, he was having trouble staying awake eyes glossing over, speech very slow. I turned to push the door open into the main pharmacy to call for help and have them dial 911, grabbed epinephrine and ammonia salts as well. When I turned back he had slumped in his chair. As I took the step back towards him, he spontaneously started to sit up and speak. Was diaphoretic, still slow speech eyes glossy. I supported him as best I could. His HR was 42, i lifted his legs up unto to a chair in quazi trandelenburg position. He stated that made him feel alot better. I stayed with him until EMTS arrived. He got himself onto they stretcher and they took him out of the store.

He then slumped to side and head hit side of wall since we had chair with side rails positioned against wall. He lost conscious for maybe 30 seconds and then eyes opened. I asked if he was OK and the first thing he asked for was water. He said he felt light headed and dizzy. I had my intern who was working grab him water from the deli and had him sit and rest. He started sweating and asked for paper towels. I grabbed him a couple of towels so he can wipe his face. I continued to check on him while doing my work. He seemed fine after that. After 30 minutes, I checked his blood pressure. It read 100/63.  I continued to monitor him and he left after that. He did have friend with him the entire time who helped him.

                                                After like two weeks, before going to bed, I started having SOB and then a full-on chaotic panic attack. Chest pain, stomach was visually twisted and hurt, felt like I had a knot in my throat and full on anxiety. It took about a week for it to start going away after one Urgent Care visit, two ER visits, and a PC visit who prescribed me with clonazepan and Prozac. When I took both of them two weeks later, my symptoms and pain finally got better, but I am still having SOB, a little fatigue, my joints hurt once in a while, digestive problems, weird chest feeling. At least the heart pains went away.

                                                At approximately 6:47pm we gave a Janssen COVID vaccine to the patient. After a few minutes the patient became noticeably sweaty with pallor. I talked with him and he said he was dizzy as well. He stated that it is due to anxiety. I checked his blood pressure and it was 124/94 with a pulse of 83. We gave him a cold pack to use on his wrists and neck. We watched the patient for any worsening of symptoms. After a while the patient stated he now felt  fine with no symptoms and left with no issues.

Technician called paramedics, store manager was called and when I asked him his name and if he knew where he was he said yes. We sat him up per his request. When he was well enough we sat him on a chair, I took his blood pressure and we got him water. He was on the phone with his dad who is a physician and dad said it sounded like a syncope and asked we give him gator aid. Paramedics arrived and they took his vitals and ran some tests.

He consented to receive a Juicey Juice juice box and sat down with some cold wet napkins on his neck. He said he felt like passing out and we led him into our vaccine room where he lay on the floor for about 5 minutes. He then wanted to sit up. He felt much better and sat in our waiting room again for 10 more minutes. He left without further incident, having never lost consciousness.

Lymphnodes have been in pain and swollen since the first or second day after the shot. Headaches on and off for a month now. And my anxiety has been like I&#39;m in fight or flight mode all of my waking moments. Even when I&#39;m falling asleep. I will wake up with panic attacks. My muscles can&#39;t take talking on the phone for longer than 5 minutes before I have to switch to my other arm because the previous arm is &#34;dead&#34; in the muscles and couldn&#39;t do it any longer. Blood pressure was in the 180-190&#39;s / the high 80&#39;s and sometimes even 90 being my bottom BP number. It has since gone down because of meditation.

                                                On June 19, 2021 I woke up around 6:00 a.m. having extreme chest pains. I went to the Emergency Room to be treated. They did an EKG, blood work, and an ultrasound of my heart. My EKG was negative for a heart attack, but my blood work was positive because of my Troponins were elevated. They gave me some aspirin and the chest pain went away. I was admitted into the hospital where I stayed until the end of the day on June 21, 2021. On June 20, 2021 they continued to watch my vitals, took tons of blood for blood cultures and for pretty much every virus you can get along with urine samples as well. All of the test for any virus and the blood cultures were negative. The urinalysis and urine culture were negative as well. Once all test came back negative, the cardiologist ordered a Heart cath. The heart cath was performed on June 21, 2021 and there was no blockage in any of my arteries and everything was clear so I was discharged that afternoon from the hospital. I was diagnosed with Myocarditis or Pericarditis. The doctor prescribed me 25MG Captopril to take 3 times daily and 25 MG Metoprolol Tartrate to take 2 times daily. I have only experienced any other affects a few times since being released which was a burning sensation in my check. I spoke with the doctor and they told me it could be indigestion or heart burn.

The next morning I woke up with a headache and was achy/sore throughout my body. While I was eating I passed out without any signs. I was unconscious and do not remember the episode. Once I was alert, I felt nauseas and was heading to the restroom when I passed out again and was unconscious. I do not remember the episodes. There were no signs of passing out before I did either time.

The  time from vaccine administration to EMS arrival was approximately 20-25 minutes.   The patient was able to talk and communicate clearly the entire time except during the brief unconscious period.

My adverse effects were the following throwing up, pain in the upper Portion of my neck and slight pain in my chest , and fever with chills  grandually getting worse throughout the day.

I eventually fell asleep because of exhaustion, and Sunday I couldn?t even get out of bed my body was so worn out from the shot and the night. I stayed home all day and slept . I still  have pains in my neck and coughing becomes my issue.

                                                ED NOTE is as follows...from 4/21/21 @ 21:47    a 28 y.o. male who to the emergency room with reports of a headache for the last 48 hours.  He reports this as being one of the worst headaches he has ever had.  He was seen at urgent care and given Toradol, Zofran and Benadryl and still rates his pain an 8 out of 10.  He does feel pressure behind his eyes.  And reports vomiting in the parking lot at urgent care.  He denies abdominal pain back pain, neck pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, numbness or tingling or any other worsening concerns.  Reports that he did receive a recent Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination.  Patient states he does vape.  He occasionally drinks alcohol he denies any illicit drugs.  Patient denies any head trauma.   Diagnosis management comments: This is a 28-year-old male arrives to the emergency room with reported migraine headache for the last 48 hours.  He did report that he was go to urgent care in which he received a migraine cocktail of Zofran, Benadryl and Toradol.  Patient reported that his headache was not resolved so urgent care sent him on for further evaluation.  Patient upon arrival had a negative neurological exam however he did report that he had pressure behind his eyes.  Was unable to see any papilledema on funduscopic exam.  Check patient&#39;s pressures bilaterally and they were 21 and 18.  Patient did report to me that this was the worst headache of his life.  I did administer IV fluids here as well as Tylenol and morphine.  Patient did report some improvement.  Patient did report in his past medical history had a recent Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination.  A CBC and CMP was obtained.  Did have thrombocytopenia with a count of 66.  Since my exam was PERRL with normal extraocular movements.  He had no eye redness or eye pain.  Of low concerns for any iritis or uveitis.  Patient&#39;s patient CT of his head did show a abnormal CT that had a dense appearing superior sagittal sinus that was representing a venous thrombosis.  Radiologist did recommend a MRI MRV.  An MRI and MRV was ordered.  Patient MRI MRv did show findings are consistent with a venous thrombosis involving the right jugular right transverse sinus and superior sagittal sinus there is also a patchy edematous change within the subcortical white matter areas bilaterally and symmetrically.  There was no CVA.  With patient&#39;s reported migraine headache.  Reported blurred vision, low platelets, recent vaccination I do believe patient has vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia.  With this finding I did converse with my overseeing physician Calls were made out to neurology and then a call out did prefer to have patient started on IVIG at 1 g/kg daily for 2 days and blood thinner Xarelto 15 mg p.o. twice daily.  These orders were initiated.  Internal med services was consulted and with conversations of family, internal med services out possible transfer that an interventionalists could be available if patient needed it.  Report was given at 2100 upon my end of shift.

Helped to lie down on matt, with feet in chair, and cool cloth applied to neck. Blood pressure was 100/64 and pulse was 64. After about 2 minutes, he said he felt better than when he first came in. I asked him if he had ever had this happen before and he said yes when he had blood drawn a few years ago. He was helped to sit up in a chair. He no longer had any light-headedness and his color was returning to normal. His lips were now pink. He was given a granola bar and water to drink. After staying for 20 minutes longer he left. He was called the next day by me and he said he had not had any light-headedness after he left.

After injection, he felt faint, he became unresponsive, his head fell back and he was sliding down the chair.  In moments he came to, and wanted to lie on floor, we moved him to the floor.  Paramedics were called.  He was pale and sweating on the floor.  He stated his neck was stiff and face was tingling.   Paramedics came and evaluated him.  The patient chose not to go to the hospital. This was approximately over a 30 minute period.

Immediately after regaining composure I began sweating profusely and became very pale/flushed color in face at which point I exited the vehicle and flagged EMS to assist me. EMS monitored blood pressure and blood saturation before releasing me on my own recognizance approximately 25 minutes later. Tingling sensation felt in left arm after fainting approximately 10 minuets after initial injection. Next 48 hours after injection I experienced severe body chills, body aches, headache, nausea, loss of appetite, and night sweats. 72 hours after injection I am close to fully recovered but still experience fatigue and night sweats.

I  cant do any strenuous activity and they have to do further testing on my heart, which is interfering with my job. I&#39;m still having the chest pain.

                                                vasovagal syncope or seizure? After receiving the drive-through vaccine, we drove into a parking space to sit and make sure I was ok. Within 5-10 minutes, I was sitting in the car and sending a text and with no warning whatsoever mid-text lost consciousness, profuse sweating, wheezing, lost color in my skin, was making unintelligible noises, and eventually woke up about a minute later but couldn&#39;t speak or comprehend those speaking to me (according to my wife who was terrified).  I was not nervous, stressed, or scared of receiving a vaccine. I regained the ability to speak about a minute later and my wife had summoned the staff on the scene who instructed me to lie back and breathe without a mask. I drank some liquids. A nurse was called over and offered to take my vital signs but I decided I felt ok enough not to. Eventually my normal skin color and came back and sweating stopped after about 5 minutes. We sat for a few extra minutes and once I felt it was past me,  my wife drove us home.

                                                I had extreme chest pain on the 24th of March. It really hurt to breathe and it felt like I had pressure on my chest. I went to the Emergency room and they did a chest x-ray and a Covid-19 both of which were negative. I went home and I returned to the ER because the chest pain became worse. The chest X-Ray the second day showed I had pneumonia. I was told that it could have been from the Covid-19 in December or if was community acquired.  I was prescribed with antibiotics and discharged. I still feel some chest pain  after about a week and I have already finished the full course of antibiotics. I&#39;ve seen my Primary Care physician, my cardiologist and my Pulmonologist.

                                                At approximately 4 pm, I gave the patient a Janssen covid-19 vaccination. I asked the patient to sit for 15 minutes for observation. About 10 minutes later I was notified someone wasn&#39;t doing well. I went to the patient and he was hunched down and looked pale and he stated he was very dizzy. I asked him if he had trouble breathing and he stated he had not. He appeared like he was about to pass out, I was asking him questions about his state and he wasn&#39;t being coherent. I told him I was going to give an EpiPen and call 911. I gave him the EpiPen in his outer thigh. EMS came 5 minutes later.  A few hours later I got a call from a close by asking if I had given him a Benadryl because he was feeling drowsy. I asked his status and the nurse stated he was doing fine.

                                                High fever reaching 103.8° F. Between 7pm and 12am, my fever ranged from 100-103.8° F Elevated resting heart rate of 90-130 beats per minute. My normal is 62-75 bpm. While I was sleeping, my heart rate ranged from 93-113 bpm (according to Apple Watch). Extreme headache Inability to sleep Chills and shakes Extreme fatigue Light headed and unable to speak clearly  I don?t know if this was life threatening; I know it was likely my immune system responding but these side effects were extreme. I almost called an ambulance. I?ve never felt pain like that before in my head. My heart felt like it was racing all night and my brain felt like it was going to expand out of my skull. The head pain, heart rate, and rapid breathing was keeping me up.  I tried to sleep 7pm?12am which was the worst of it. By the middle of the night, it seemed that the fever subsided and my resting heart rate was more in the 90-100 range (still 15-30% high).   The next day, I have a moderate headache that feels like after pain from the night before. Fever subsided. Heart rate is slightly high at 80-100 bpm. I managed to sleep in the whole morning.  I had to take off from work today in order to rest.

I move to my bed. 7:30 PM - In bed, dressed in sweatshirt, wool socks, etc., a a couple blankets wrapped around me, space heater turned to 80 degrees, shaking uncontrollably from being so cold (mostly hands and feet), mild headache begins in middle back of head.  8:00 PM - still freezing, temperature was at 98.7. most of body is aching 9:00 PM - chills and body ache starting to slow down, temperature at 100.3 9:30 PM - still have chills, space heater still on and i was still wrapped in a bunch of clothing/blankets. temp at 100.5 and i drank 6 oz water.  10 PM - chills going away, heat/blankets/clothing still on, temp at 101. body aches mostly only in left and right calf.   Rest of night until around 4 A.M. was me tossing and turning being restless. My heart rate was ~130 BPM throughout the entire night according to my smart watch. I was checking my temperature constantly with an infrared thermometer and it was between 101-102.5. I probably drank ~24 oz of water throughout the night. It felt like each time i fell asleep, i would wake up no more than 30 min later and each time i woke up it felt like i had been asleep for 5 hours. At a few moments it felt like i was hallucinating seeing little boxes around my head.. At no point  during the episode did i take any advil/tyenol/etc. Only drank water. Woke up around noon the next day, I felt extremely groggy, still had a headache and my temperature was back to ~98.  I ate for the first time that day around 1 P.M. and had a few advil which helped with my headache.

                                                Patient was looking pale a minute after the shot, I asked how he was doing, he responded by saying he felt very dizzy. I asked him to take slow deep breaths, gave him some water. About after 1 more minute he passed out (very unresponsive but still breathing, pupils very dilated) pulse was slow but still palpable. Tried ammonium smelling salts, that did not bring patient around. Called 911. Tried patting patient and talking to patient to bring them back to consciousness. After about a minute or two patient was able to respond to me. He knew his name and date of birth and where he was. Asked him to wait for ambulance to check vitals. Patient said he still felt very dizzy. Kept his head down and eyes closed. Once EMS arrived they checked his vitals, determined BP was low (they did not tell me a number). They monitored patient&#39;s vitals for 10-15 minutes. BP did not &#34;bounce back&#34; per EMS so they took him to the hospital for IV drip possibly.

The patient was sitting down, so I approached to see if it was an allergic reaction or not. I checked for breathing and had another patient call 911.  Patient woke back up while we had the 911 operator on the phone.  He asked for some water and he felt light headed.

At day 7 I started to feel sharp, cramps, tingly sensation and numbness in different parts of my legs, arms feet and hands. I also had headaches and felt dizzy. Headaches went away by day 15, but the pain, tingly sensation and fatigue in my arms and legs still remain (tomorrow it?s going to be a month since I got my shot). It gets significantly worse when I walk and I feel very fatigued after walking for about 30 minutes.  The pin has also appeared less frequently on other parts of my body, like my heart, my neck and around my rib area. Over the last two weeks my legs have also been getting itchy.

He verbalized that it might be &#34;mental&#34;?? and it usually happens to him when he &#34;gets blood&#34;. He remained under observation and stated that he felt better.

She states his eyes rolled back and then slumped over and arms flailed a few times. The patient didn&#39;t know it had happened. He stated he felt dizzy and looked pale. We gave him a water bottle and after a few minutes he felt better.

I went over to observe and gave patient some water.  He was starting to sweat and turned very pale.  1 minute later he passed out.  I brought him to the floor from his chair and he  starting shaking and &#39;seizing&#34; for about 10-15 seconds.  We used pressure on his chest to try to &#34;snap&#34; him out of it.  After about 15 seconds of &#34;seizing,not breathing normally and his left arm completely locked up&#34; he came to and did not know where he was for about 2-3 minutes.  After about that time he started to realize where he was and recognized his wife who was assisting.  EMS was called and arrived shortly,  He was lucid and knew where he was and started to feel normal again.  EMS checked his vitals and they were normal.  Patient refused to go to hospital and EMS released him to his wife.  I checked on patient 4 hours later and he had no ill effects and stated he felt just like he did before receiving the vaccination.

                                                Almost immediately after receiving the vaccine pt went rigid and was unresponsive.  He came to within a minute.  He was very panicked and stated he thought it was a dream.  He was extremely pale and very sweaty.  We gave him some water and an ice pack to cool down.  We checked his blood pressure.  He then lied down on the floor and we elevated his feet.  He then stated he could not move his hands and his lips were tingly.  We then gave him some liquid benadryl and continued checking his blood pressure and called EMS.  They arrived and he left with them.  I tried contacting him later without success.  Will try again tomorrow.

He tried standing back up and the 2nd patient had to grab and hold the fainting patient until I was able to come help. Patient fainted for less than 10 seconds, as I cautiously helped lay him down on the floor. I checked for vitals, and elevated patient&#39;s legs, and gave him ice to help. Patient remained in laying position for 15 minutes, regained strength and sat up for another 15 minutes, in which time, he was given water to drink and a protein bar to eat. I also took patient&#39;s blood pressure, which was within normal limits (approx. 117/82, HR 86). Patient and his mother both left the pharmacy without further incident.

Right around after 15 minutes, he came to the counsel window to let me know that he was not feeling good and he passed out. He became conscious right away as our staff members called his name to check if he was ok and called our store manager. We asked him if he was ok and gave him a bottle of water to drink. We asked him to call his family member to get a ride for the safety of the patient. I checked his status as he was waiting for a ride.  After 30 minutes, he left our pharmacy with his family member. I called him for the follow up and left message to call us if he has any concerns.

Approximately 2 minutes after waiting in the monitoring area pt states he experienced flushing, dizziness and clamminess then ?passed? out for approximately 20 seconds while in a seated position. Syncope was witness by patients girlfriend. RN didn?t witness pt syncope, but noted patient laying in the seat then immediately alerted me. Pt was recovering in a seated position when I arrived, with noted pt w/ diaphoresis with no associated respiratory distress. While I was collecting pts history said he didn?t want to talk about it anymore in an attempt to calm himself down, approximately 2-3 minutes later I witnessed pt have another syncopal episode which lasted 15-20 seconds while in seated position. Pt regained consciousness and I had an employee help me move pt to the floor for recovery. Pt displayed no signs of respiratory distress, denied chest pain and headache. Pt states syncope is his typical response after vaccinations or blood draws, last occurrence was 8 months ago during a blood draw. Pt states these syncopal episodes initially started in childhood and has gotten worse as he has gotten older, pts father also experiences these episodes. Pt declined EMS several times. Pt was monitored for 41 minutes, vitals taken twice while pt was in recovery on the floor, vitals were stable. I had pt lay supine on the floor for approximately 15 mins post syncopal episode. After recovering for 15 mins I had patient sit upright on the floor, reassessed him and repeated vitals which were stable, pt reported feeling well. After approximately 10 mins pt was helped up into a seat, vitals were stable and patient reported feeling well and having no complaints. I had pt stand and repeated vitals which continued to be stable and pt reported no complaints. Pt drove to the vaccination site in a rental care which he states he will leave parked close to vaccination site and initially states he?d walk. I recommended pt and girlfriend take a free ride home which the agreed to do. I personally walked the patient up the stairs which pt was able to do with no problem and no reported complaints. Pt was given strict ER precautions and given resources for primary care also. Pt stable at the time of discharge. Pt declined follow up.  Pt stable at the time of discharge. Pt accompanied by with girlfriend, who will get pt home via ride.

The pharmacist went to tend to him and he came to within a few minutes. A frozen water bottle was place on the back of his neck as he continued to lay on the ground for about 5 minutes. He then moved into the chair a she was starting to feel a little better. At about 4:45 he left to go home on his own.

We talked for a few minutes prior to administration and I actually administered a vaccine to the person in the driver&#39;s seat first. I walked over to give his shot and he then tells me he &#34;doesn&#39;t do well with vaccines.&#34; He later told me he felt sick to his stomach after getting the shot and had a metallic smell similar to a bloody nose. About 1 minute after administering his vaccine, the patient&#39;s head went back, his muscles went very stiff, and he appeared to convulse. We called 9-1-1. His mom was sitting in the back seat and placed an ice cube on the back of his neck which seems to have pulled him out of it. During the episode, he reports &#34;blacking out&#34; without orientation to time or place. After the episode, he was dizzy and lightheaded for a few minutes. Soon there after he was jovial. I took his BP and HR about 5 minutes later BP 100/62 and HR 48. Paramedics also took vitals which were a bit higher than these. He reported having a small cereal bar for breakfast and 2 cups of coffee.

                                                Pt received his single vaccination of Janssen, and fainted while waiting in waiting area after receiving his vaccination.  Pt says he has a needle phobia, and was hesitant to get the vaccine. He had a muffin to eat earlier in the day, and nothing since. The tech, called  me when she saw him fall. when I saw him, he was standing up. He sat back on his chair. I got his to rest with his head lowered. He appeared to be dizzy and cold and clammy. When I took his Blood Pressure, it was 95/46. He had a 1 cm cut below his right eyebrow. He did not want to go for stitches, because he hates needles. After resting up for about 30 minutes, he told me that he felt better, then left.

No treatment sought at this time.

                                                After receiving the Janssen Covid 19 vaccine, I proceeded to the waiting area and was instructed to wait 15 minutes before leaving the facility. Approximately 5 minutes after receiving the injection, I started to feel faint, lightheaded, nausea, and clammy. I informed a member of the staff and several medical personnel came to assist. They laid me down on a cot and checked my vitals. I started to feel better after laying down. The staff took my blood pressure and heart rate readings, which were relatively normal. But after sitting me up and taking my vitals again, my blood pressure and heart rate spiked. I was taken to Hospital in an ambulance; however, after waiting in the ER waiting room for about 2.5 hours, I left without seeing a doctor. During those 2.5 hours my original symptoms did not return, so I elected to leave.

He said that he was texting on his phone and the next thing he knew, he was on the ground with people around him asking if he was ok. He stated that he was very sweaty, nauseous, and a little dizzy. We called a code white, provided the pt with a cold compress and elevated his feet. Pt did not want us to call 911. Pt did not have PCP and has not been to a doctor in about 5 years. He said he was very nervous getting the shot and is afraid of needles so that may have contributed. Pt stayed in the pharmacy area for about 45 minutes until he started to feel better and his mom came to get him. I tried calling pt again at 7:10pm to check in, but there was no answer and I could not leave a voicemail due to mailbox being full.

                                                I developed extreme body aches and chills along with an extreme fever, and it progressed throughout the night until I was delirious. I fainted once trying to take medication (ibeprofen) in the bathroom. I never measured the fever because I was delirious and could hardly move due to pain. I have never felt so sick in my life and I am a healthy 30 year old with no other health issues. I am feeling better this morning but have lingering symptoms of chills and aches. I am reporting this because the intensity of the reaction seemed overwhelmingly extreme and scary for someone of my health and age.

Patient became alert and oriented as well as stopped the bleeding before paramedics arrived. After being assessed by the paramedics, he requested not to go to the hospital and to leave on his own. I requested the patient sit for another 15 minutes before leaving to which he obliged and thanked me before leaving.

                                                I received the vaccine on Wednesday, April 7th.  I was told I had an anaphylactic reaction at the time of injection: I started sweating upon receiving the vaccine, my blood pressure dropped, and I almost passed out. I was monitored for 30 mins before being sent home. Other than some fatigue, I was fine the rest of the day.  On Thursday, April 8th, I was tired but felt fine otherwise.  Friday and Saturday, April 9th and 10th, I felt like I was back to normal and even did some light exercise.  On Sunday morning, April 10th, the left side of my body (side of injection) went numb, I had extreme vertigo, shortness of breath, and blotches that appeared in random places. It didn&#39;t look like hives, but rather looked like strips of red. I didn&#39;t feel like I was having an allergic reaction, but something did not feel right. I consider myself a pretty healthy guy with a healthy lifestyle. I did not feel the need to go to the ER quite yet, but I did have a friend come over to monitor me.  My friend did some acupuncture which helped resolve the numbness and dizziness and some of the blotches, and also mentioned concerns regarding blood circulation and potential clotting issues she thought I was having.

After washing my hands, I turned to the towel and vaguely remember falling to the floor. When I came to, I was too weak to get up. I laid there for 5 minutes before struggling to sit. After some time I was able to weakly return to bed and drank some rehydration tablets. My best guess was I had been drinking water but not replenishing my electrolytes.

I had the Janssen vaccine shot at around 5PM on Thursday and felt mostly fine on Friday. I had typical shot symptoms (tired and soreness near injection sight). On Friday night around 10:00, I was standing talking to one of my friends in the living room when I had a blackout seizure without any warning. The seizure only lasted about 30-45 seconds, and then I became conscious again. It took me about 5-10 minutes to become completely aware and able to stand up. I have never had a seizure before and have not had one since then.  Later the following week, I did have a couple of hours where I felt extremely dizzy and lightheaded, but it went away without another seizure. This is also not typical for me.

                                                About 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine patient approached the pharmacy and said he wasn&#39;t feeling well. I asked him if he would like some water and he accepted. He returned to the chair in front of the pharmacy and sipped on the water. He looked like he was pale and breathing more slowly. I went out front to check on him and his breathing appeared labored, he was sweating profusely and he said he felt lightheaded and his hands were tingling. I told him to relax and take some breaths. His hands were very shaky and I took him BP (94/61 and HR 54). At this point I had my technician call 911.  Between the time the paramedics arrived he went unresponsive for approx 20-30 seconds. I yelled his name and slapped his leg. No response. I checked for a pulse and if he was breathing. He did have a pulse and was breathing. After coming to the paramedics arrived and took him to the hospital for evalution.

She was able to catch his fall and lie him on the ground.  I went into the immunization room to assist immediately and he was apologizing for scaring.  I asked him to lie there for a few minutes and take some deep breaths.  He was talking and aware of his surroundings.  I asked him about his medication history which was null.  I asked him if he had been nervous and he said he didn&#39;t think so. She said that he did mention he did not like needles.  He had not eaten since the morning (a bagel) and it was late in the afternoon.  After a few minutes I asked him if he would like to sit up so I could see how he was doing.  Management arrived and observed while I went to get a cold cloth for his neck/face.  Management asked him if he would like to sit in a chair.  He sat in a chair and before I came back after just a few minutes, he had slumped over to the side with his eyes rolling back.  Management  was concerned so they immediately called 911.  fire department and EMS arrived.  They tested his blood pressure, etc and said they believed he had just passed out.  They asked him if he wanted to go to the hospital.  He declined.  He called a family member to pick him up who arrived about 45 minutes after his vaccination.  He was walking around and coherent when he left.

Code white as called and  was by the patient to make sure they did not fall out of the chair. EMS responded and took over as they called 911 to have the patient checked out. The ems confirmed the patient was stable and the patient did not need to be put in the ambulance. Pt was given orange juice and an ice pack. Pt was checked on before they left and they were ok.

                                                The night/next morning after receiving the vaccine I was awoken by a racing heart rate that I measured at a resting heart rate of 200 bpm. After 5 minutes of trying to assess what was happening, I recognized that my heart rate was not slowing down. I woke my wife because I was worried and had difficulty breathing. It continued to be in the 180-190&#39;s, I called an ambulance. On the way to the hospital my resting heart rate was 180. After I got to the hospital they ran blood work, a CT scan and a chest x-ray. I was in the hospital until 10 am. My heart rate steadily fell to about 110 beats per minute after 9 hours in the hospital. They released me because my tests had come back normal. Upon being released, I came home, had lots of fluids and rest. After 1 week, my heart rate went back up to 160&#39;s. My chest started to feel tight again and I had difficulty breathing again. I called my PCP emergency number and they advised me to go back to the ER at 10 am on 05/15/2021. They did another EKG, a D-Dimer and I received saline. My heart rate dropped to 120 and they released me. I was given an all clear from all tests performed. Sunday-Wed that week, I had a slightly elevated resting heart rate, have had difficulty getting a full breath, general stomach pains and I had felt fatigued. Thurs-Sat, my resting heart rate returned to normal (60 bpm) minimal difficulty breathing, but continued pressure in my abdomen and chest. Saturday I fell asleep because I was having a migraine. I woke up at 10 pm and the cycle started again. My heart rate went back up into the 160&#39;s. I called the emergency line for my PCP and was told to go back to the ER (05/22/2021). They performed a chest x-ray, an EKG and some blood work. My resting heart rate went to 90 bpm around 3 am and was sent back home. The rest of Sunday, I had difficulty getting a full breath and my resting heart was higher than usual. I had an echocardiogram on Wednesday and it came back normal. I wore a heart monitor for 24 hours, but I have not received the results yet from my doctor. I have never experienced any sort of cardiac episode in my life.

Pt told me he was feeling dizzy. Had pt put his head down to his knees while I questioned him about other symptoms. Pt reported no nausea, no feeling of fullness, no itching, no headache, no other signs/symptoms. Dizziness abated after pt had his head down for 2-3 minutes. BP taken at 3:13 pm was 133/106 pulse 59. Explained to pt that I needed to continue observing him for signs of adverse rxn for a total of 30 minutes though he indicated that he was feeling better. pt agreed. Let pt go after the 30 minutes was up. counseled pt to mention the dizziness if ever he needs a Janssen &#34;booster&#34; in the future.

They subsided, but I still don?t have an appetite, and I keep coughing up mucous, some with what looks like blood streaks, like a blood vessel, and blood spots when I blow my nose. And my lungs feel heavy. And it?s almost impossible to breathe deeply with coughing. Although I can go a few hours without coughing. The blood is very rare but it has happened several times in the past 4-5 days. It could have to do with my vaping, but it isn?t normal, only since being vaccined.

Upon standing up from the laying down position, I got lightheaded, started profusely sweating, became nauseous and ultimately lost consciousness. When I regained my consciousness, there was a loud ringing in my ears and my hands were numb. I took some Tylenol, laid down and it subsided shortly after. I did not experience any symptoms as severe as this at any point again.

He verbalized ahead of time that he has a history of fainting due to his fear of needles.  He does not have any allergic reaction to vaccine components.  After reviewing his PQCF and possible side effects of the vaccine, patient verbally consented to get vaccinated.  I administered the vaccine into the deltoid muscle of his right arm.  I gave him an ice pack.  Right after the vaccine was administered patient said he felt fine.  He relocated from the immunization booth to a Post Vaccine waiting chair with his wife by his side.  He fainted into his wifes&#39;s arms for about 30 seconds.  His father-in-law helped place him on his back on the floor and we raised his legs up on a chair.  Patient came to immediately when placed on supine position and said he just needed to rest.  We called Code White and assistant manager came to the scene.  Patient was conscious and verbalized that he was feeling fine but should just rest.  Patient continued to use ice pack and rested for about 30 minutes.

                                                15min after receiving the vaccine I felt chills on the right side of my body and muscle soreness in arm spreading up to right side of neck.  10hrs after receiving the vaccine I developed a headache that lasted for 72hrs and wasn&#39;t relieved by Tylenol.  I began running a fever of 101F, muscle and joint aches, chills, sweating that soaked by bedding that lasted for 48hrs.  Four days after the injection, I   noticed my legs from knee down were swollen for 36hrs.   I also experienced by heartbeat racing for 48hrs that began 10hrs after the injection.

We pulled of the freeway and I walked around for a few minutes trying to catch my breath but I was unable to. My wife started to drive and I as I sat in the passenger seat I started getting the chills and all the muscles in my body were shaking. When we got to town I told my wife we needed to go to the ER because I was not feeling well. That is where they did some tests and hooked me up to an IV.

                                                The afternoon after I got the shot I went for a jog. When I returned, I got intense chills and a fever of 103 degrees along with some flu like symptoms. I had a slight headache. Ibuprofen helped but the next day I had similar symptoms, but they went away by the end of the day. On the third day I felt a little better, so I went for a run. I had some shortness of breath and it was difficult to breathe when I was running. I normally run 4 miles daily. The shortness of breath was present for a week after that and also started to happen intermittently even at rest. One week after the shot I saw a doctor and they did some testing but did not find anything definitive. Six weeks after the shot I went to the ER and they diagnosed with Thrombocytopenia. At this point it has been seven weeks the shortness of breath has improved, and I haven&#39;t experienced it for a few days.

                                                I began having strange heart palpitations in the late afternoon, 5 days after receiving the vaccine. On the morning of the 6th day, I had an elevated heart rate, chest tightness and shortness of breath. It was difficult to have a conversation without having to constantly stop to take a deep breath, to ?catch up.? My lungs felt like they had substantially less capacity with a deep breath than before the symptoms presented. I had extreme fatigue, joint and muscle pain. On the 7th day, I woke up with the same symptoms, and decided to go back to bed due to continues extreme fatigue. After waking up, I felt somewhat better, until later in the evening, when all the aforementioned symptoms came back. The following morning (8th day) I felt much better, and decided to go on a mountain bike ride to see how my heart and breathing felt. I noticed some decreased cardiovascular performance, but not as bad as the previous days. Later that evening, the shortness of breath and elevated heart rate came back. On the 9th day, the elevated heart rate was noticeably better, and the shortness of breath was still present, but not as bad as before. My blood pressure remained elevated and I have been unable to get it below 135/80 range. Same issues on the 10th day. Today, on the 11th day, I attempted to go run and found that my cardiovascular conditioning was the worst I have ever experienced in my life, without exaggeration. I had difficulty with a pace and duration that I would normally complete with ease before being vaccinated. I had to cut it short, as I was having difficulty breathing and my lungs were burning. I hope that these symptoms subside and are not permanent. I was hesitant to get the vaccine for a very long time, but decided to do it based of off removal of the mask mandates for vaccinated personnel. If I could go back knowing I would feel this way, I would never have allowed this vaccine to be injected in my body. I am a healthy, athletic 31 year old male, and now I feel like I am in the worst shape of my life. I feel awful.

                                                I got my Covid vaccine on Wednesday, 5/5/21. That night I experienced the typical side effects (Chills, Aches, Pains, Soreness in the injection site on my right arm). By Thursday afternoon I was feeling significantly better. However, on Friday evening I started to feel a tightness and pressure in my chest and left arm and neck. The chest pain felt like I was having a heart attack but my heart rate was mostly normal. I felt shortness of breath  where I couldn&#39;t get a good deep breath in and I was also nauseous and had no appetite. At times I felt lightheaded and weak. These symptoms continued over the next couple days. On Monday 5/10/21 I decided to got to the ER to get checkout since I was still having chest pains and tightness. They ran a series of tests and concluded that I was just experiencing typical aches and pains from the vaccine.  My symptoms continued for another full week and at times the shortness of breath and chest pains felt really severe. By the following week I was starting to feel a little better on and off. I got my appetite back and and I was able to start exercising again. After about 2 full weeks after receiving the vaccine most of chest pain and pressure &#43; shortness of breath has disappeared and I feel better.

                                                On Saturday, I woke up to my right arm - at injection site area - was itching. I woke up to numerous nose bleeds. I&#39;m not prone to nose bleeds. Also - consistent since Saturday, Diarrhea; muscles aches; fatigue; vomiting. Problems with keeping liquid and food down now - just started a couple of days ago. Dr called me on Friday -I was doing okay; On Monday - he called again and I wasn&#39;t doing well. Have spoken to my doctor each day. And now  (since two days ago) it feels like my skin is tearing apart and burning and that the inside of my bones are on fire. At the same time, I couldn&#39;t keep food and liquid down anymore. Autonomic immune system is in fight response since Saturday. Haven&#39;t been able to get out of bed for last two days. Diarrhea has worsened. - Have been taking Zofran - nausea med for the last two days. To subdue the vomiting. Have a new medication that I am starting today to subdue the diarrhea - can&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called. Trying to make sure it doesn&#39;t go into an autonomic crisis. Only Telemed visits so far - video appts. Have had several fevers doing this time - currently at 100 but went up to 103. I have gone to low grade too and means I have not been doing well at all - on Saturday to Sunday. (Went to high grade - Mon, Tuesday, Wednesday).

                                                Received the J&amp;J vaccine in May 20. Started experiencing leg muscle and back pain June 1, 2021. Progressively got worse over the following weeks. On June 15 I woke up with a new pain in my leg. Went to urgent care and had a D-Dimer test that came out very high. I was sent to ER where they discovered one clot in each leg and two in my lungs via ultra sound and ct scan. I was immediately hooked up to herapin blood thinner through an IV. I was released the following afternoon with Eliquis blood thinner tablets.

Paramedics were called, vitals were checked - was eventually able to leave the facility and return home.

A few minutes later pt began sweating and feeling dizzy. He tried to lie down on the floor, but passed out. He hit his face and got a bloody nose, scrape on his cheek and swollen lip. He came right to and notified us of what happened. He stated he had only eaten applesauce for breakfast. We gave him some water and crackers. He started feeling better. We had him sit in the waiting room for a while, probably about 30-45 minutes. He stated that he felt fine. We offered medical assistance, calling 911, or calling to have someone pick him up, but he refused all. At that point, he said he felt much better and was ready to leave. He said he felt fine to drive home. His mom was meeting him there.

I went to check on him and he was yellowish in color and barely able to speak to me. I asked another pharmacist to get me a cold pack and water. By the time we got the cold pack and water, he was not speaking, but eyes were open. I called 911 and the other pharmacist fanned him and placed the cold pack on his head and neck. He started talking within minutes and we waited for ambulance to come just to check him out. He was ablet to verify his name and where he was and EMSA came at 3:50pm. He left to their truck and said he was okay just felt shaky and clammy, but he could hear everyone talking to him.

Although he was sitting in a chair, his head fell to the left and his forehead bumped the table. The patient&#39;s legs were elevated and his upper body was laid back. Ammonia inhalant was crushed and immediately placed under the patient&#39;s nose. The patient came back to consciousness approximately 30 seconds after passing out. Patient was asked what symptoms he felt leading up to passing out. He said that he suddenly felt dizzy and does not remember much after. Patient states that he did not eat breakfast prior to receiving the vaccine and has a history of not doing well with needles or vaccines. He states that he now feels completely fine, however, the patient was advised to stay 30 minutes for monitoring, and once he felt comfortable standing up, a nurse walked with him to the observation area.

Patient said they felt a little nauseous but then dizzy and things went dark. We kept them laying down on the floor with knees up, took their BP (127/72) and waited for medics to come. Medics arrived within 10 minutes to evaluate the patient, offered to take them to the hospital, patient declined and they released them to take it easy and call them/go to hospital if they felt faint again.

                                                I typically faint when getting shots or blood drawn. I did faint about 10 seconds after the initial shot injection. I was conscious throughout but was not able to speak clearly or control my body even though I could hear everything going on around me. After 30 minutes, I was feeling back to normal. The remainder of the day I felt drowsy and a little out of it. At 12:15am I began to get severe chills and shakes. This lasted throughout the night but was the worst from about 12:15-1:00am. I woke up at 4am with a fever and sweating. My entire body was stiff and in pain with aches specifically in my arms and legs. Very sore pain in my left deltoid where the shot was injected and is still slightly sensitive. It felt like my veins were stiff and in pain and it hurt to move. I had what I can describe as flu like symptoms (i.e. my teeth hurt, my body ached, fever, shakes, body stiffness and overall tiredness and weakness). These all lasted until about 6:30am at the worst and were relieved over the next few hours. I started to feel back to normal around 3pm later that day. That was April 11th. Last night, April 12th, I had trouble sleeping because my left arm was in pain from my elbow to fingers. It was a lingering pain that went away by this morning and  is mostly gone now (morning April 13th).

I started feeling flu like fatigue, body aches, and a headache 8 hours post injection. I ran a 101&#43; fever Monday night and got less than 4 hours sleep due to fever and fairly intense muscle aches. On Tuesday morning the headache, fever and muscle aches persisted till the late evening accompanied by general fatigue. By 9:00 on Tuesday night I was feeling significant improvement and slept well Tuesday night with minor night sweats on and off. Wednesday morning I felt 80% back to normal. No fever, minor headache only evident when standing up quickly or sudden head movement, and continued muscles aches body wide specifically in the neck and chest as well as injection site muscle soreness. These symptoms continue to persist into Thursday at the same or perhaps slightly elevated levels. Friday 4/15 symptoms persist with generalized soreness, fatigue, headache,  injection site soreness. Not his typical self.

                                                I experienced a sudden onset of symptoms approximately 7 hours post-vaccination. Symptoms started with severe chills, elevated heart rate, fever (~102), and progressed into muscle and joint soreness, severe migraine with sensitivity to light, and strong fatigue, coupled with insomnia. The symptoms were severe enough that I considered going to the hospital, but ultimately did not. Fever, chills, and elevated heart rate subsided by the next morning (~12 hours after onset), but muscle soreness, migraine, and fatigue lasted for another 12-24 hours, along with a loss of appetite.  I am an otherwise healthy, male adult with no outstanding medical conditions whatsoever. This was one of the most severe immune responses I have ever had, including actual illnesses. I have received other vaccinations in the past and never had any response nearly as severe. I was significantly concerned for my overall health during the height of the vaccine response, and I wanted to report this to ensure that is aware of these types of responses, and can help prepare others by informing them adequately of the types of responses to expect from the vaccine. This response very much took me by surprise in terms of severity -- I had to call out of work at a critical time.

                                                Covid-19 vaccine JJ: 32 y.o. male w/ no PMH presenting 2 weeks after receiving his Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID vaccine after having severe L calf pain found to have thrombocytopenia.    From H&amp;P on 4/21, Patient reports that he had both fevers and aches after his vaccine (4/8/2021). Several days later developed low back pain radiating into his left leg which he initially attributed to sciatica. However, several days later, he went for a 6 mile hike, and felt that his left leg was hurting more. He went to PCP, where he received a blood test and was found to have a platelet count in the low 60s. This was initially thought to be a lab error, but he noticed that his left leg was swollen, somewhat red, and appeared that his blood vessels were swollen. This swelling resolves when he is lying down, and is worsened when he is standing. He received an US to r/o DVT, which was negative. However, after his repeat platelet count demonstrated thrombocytopenia, he was sent to the ED. He denies any recent leg trauma, though he has broken his leg before nearly 15 years ago.  He denies weakness or issues going to the bathroom. Denies chest pain or shortness of breath. Denies chills, fevers, but did wake up last 2 nights drenched in sweat. He also reports a petechial rash on his legs.   As of 4/22, medical team suspects Vaccine-induced thrombocytopenic purpura (VITT). VITT requires 1) thrombocytopenia, 2) documented clot, 3) positive PF4 Ab, and 4) recent AstraZeneca or J&amp;J vaccine. He meets criteria 1, 3, and 4. He has clinical signs of DVT but does not have a documented clot. Patient has L calf tenderness and prominent pooling of blood and vein engorgement of the L leg when he stands up. Possible that he had a DVT or multiple that cleared and now he has post-thrombotic syndrome. This is consistent with the pooling of blood with gravity and relief of symptoms with elevation. As he has had 2 negative US for DVT, unlikely that he has an unresolved DVT. abdominal and head CT are neg for thrombosis.

                                                Patient began sweating profusely approximately 10 minutes after his vaccine.  He went to his parent&#39;s car and asked his father to turn on the air conditioning as he was hot.  he then passed out in the back seat of the car.  His mother came inside and asked for assistance.  I grabbed an epi-pen and ran outside to the car.  Patient was breathing and had a pulse rate of 64.  He aroused shortly after I began asking him if he could hear me and asked if he could tell me his name.  He was pale (notably his lips were quite pale) and confused.  He could not say his name but could nod appropriately to questions when asked.  We immediately called EMS for assistance.  They arrived within 4-5 minutes and transported the patient to hospital.

Shortly afterwards while waiting in pharmacy area, we were alerted that the patient was unresponsive by his wife. Immediately responded to patient. Code white called and management responded. Tried to get him to wake up, he opened his eyes but immediately closed them again. I attempted to keep him alert and eyes open. This proceeded to go on for several minutes. Ice packs were placed on neck and wrists. Feet elevated. Once patient was alert and oriented, water was provided and patient was instructed to take small sips. Patient was kept in pharmacy area for additional 15 minutes once he was back to normal. Patient stated that when he passed out, he felt tired, couldn&#39;t see or hear.

                                                7 minutes after the injection of my Janssen injection for COVID-19, a heat enveloped my body from deep in my chest and I went pale (according to the objective findings of my nurse) and I began to feel lightheaded and almost became syncopal. I was asked to remain there for 30-minutes, and began to feel better shortly thereafter. The next several days, the lightheadedness came and went in waves, which became stronger and stronger. Two days post-injection, I developed severe joint pain where I&#39;d otherwise previously had none - for instance, my low back ached with 7/10 pain which only went away after the first week. I had thoracic spinal pain which radiated to my chest, and by day 3 I was having serial panic attacks (which I don&#39;t have), such that I visited the local emergency department to rule out sinister cardiorespiratory sequelae. I was discharged with a ddx of GERD, though I do not believe this to be true. Since then, I have largely recovered, however the lightheaded spells have dissipated only a little but are largely still plaguing me. Thankfully, the panic attacks have decreased to the point of almost being gone altogether.

                                                On the morning of Monday April 19, 2021, 1 1/2 days from receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson shot, I walked upstairs after coming down for breakfast and felt something off with my heart and I felt my heartbeat and noticed that I was in AFib. My heart had an irregular heart beat. I was taken by ambulance to the hospital where they had to shock my heart to get it back to a normal rhythm. They were able to get it back to a normal rhythm with one shock. Since then I have still noticed more heart palpitations, but have been alright since. I am a healthy 32 year old (now 33), with no health issues.

                                                Immediately after a whole blood donation, as I was walking from the donation chair to the waiting area I felt nauseous and lightheaded. Upon sitting in the waiting area I put my head down on a table and my vision began going dark. I was able to make eye contact with a phlebotomist who asked if I was okay, to which I could only shake my head ?no?. They rushed to me with ice packs and moved me back to the donation chair so I could sit in a recliner position. As I started to feel less faint they gave me apple juice, Oreos, and gordettos. I felt better within 30 minutes. The phlebotomist thought the reaction may have been due to a poor meal beforehand, which consisted of two litelife veggie dogs on white buns with ketchup, veggie chips, and cookies.

                                                Pt received the vaccination at approximately 4:25pm on 6/21/2021.  Pharmacist went over potential side effects before administration.  Pharmacist administered the vaccine, filled out his paperwork, and then stood up.  Pt stood up.  Pharmacist started to ask him to wait in the pharmacy waiting area for 15 minutes so we could make sure that he did not have a reaction.  Before the pharmacist could finish, the Patient started to sway.  He leaned against the wall, started to bend over, hit his head on the wall, and passed out.  The pharmacist called for help from the other staff.  Pt&#39;s legs were lifted up so that his feet were resting on the chair.  He had hit the bridge of his nose against the wall/side of door.  His nose was swelling up, turning black and blue, and was starting to bleed.  After about 15 seconds, the patient came around.  He was able to answer questions coherently.  He stated that he did  not need an ambulance.  Pharmacist retrieved a couple of ice packs for him and put his coat under his head.  Patient remained lying down for approximately 30 minutes before he stood up.  When he stood up, he did not sway and seemed stable.  Pt declined the pharmacy staff to contact someone to drive him home.

                                                I gained about 30lbs went from 155- 185 (weight increased about 5-10lbs every 2 weeks) body muscle mass grew? shoulders, back chest, quads etc grew, do have fat but it looks like I bulked up when I haven&#39;t worked out since COVID. Prior COVID, I went to martial arts 4 times a week and went to the gym 4-5 times a week still. My awareness was not good, hand dexterity was not as high, concentrating was not easy for long, high blood pressure, pre diabetic now,  fatty liver, gallbladder stones/sludge, have high wbc count, rbc count high, high alt/ast range is 44-88-116-222, skin sensititivty, could only stay awake for 6 hours at a time.  BTold to introduce coffee to help liver/ keep taking baby aspirin/ put back on Dexilant 60mg. When working out, I go to sleep within an hour of running 1 mile,  weight lifting gets me extremely tired now, now its not as bad, can work out longer.  In may, all my allergies disappeared, now they are back but in first month I was no longer allergic to fruits. This is new and started in June, pimples on skull and ears, voice is normal now, may have grown taller, leg shins hurt when touched. Skin still very sensitive, awake longer now  but when I work out I still get tired where I have to stop, sit, or nap.

The patient fainted or passed out at the register.   The patient fell backwards and collapsed.  The patient recovered almost immediately after passing out.  We called 911 and had the paramedics come take a look at the patient.  While waiting for the paramedics we had the patient sit in a chair and wait.  We gave the patient orange juice to drink since the patient was a diabetic and he said he felt a lot better after drinking the orange juice.  He was treated by the paramedics onsite but didn&#39;t go with them and left the store on his own.

Patient was then given fluids and lime soda that helped the patient come back to total consciousness. We continued to monitor patient for an extra 30 minutes and called family to pick him to ensure that he does not drive. Moreover, I recommended that the patient does not go snowboarding as he was thinking of heading to the mountains today.

It started on my shoulders and back, so I took a Benadryl, which was expired. So, I went to get some more and took a second dose around midnight. I won&#39;t up with none, but they were back around noon. That happened for a few days with it happening around lunch and dinner. On Tues, they started spreading more, so I went to the doctor. There was no swelling of the tongue. They lessened over the next couple of days. As of today, I have a small amount of itching, but nothing bad. I&#39;ve also been taking Claritin since yesterday. I have not seen any the same size as before, but I notice that they seem to be worse at night. I took my BP a few times and it was high at those times, but it went back to normal the next day. I will be seeing an allergist in the near future.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  First day after getting the shot I got a feeling of being very tired throughout the day I did not feel like to do anything. Also my arm was very very sore. Even moving it slightly a bit would hurt. The second day is when things got way worse I could not really sleep that well throughout the night because I noticed I had  body aches in my legs and my back. Throughout that day I also felt like I had a fever in the morning I took my temperature and had a 100 fever. At night time I took my temperature and it went up to 102, with  still a bad headache, chills, and body aches throughout my legs mostly. I also felt some palpitations. When I went to bed I was sweating very prefusively all night that I had to change my shirt. On the third day I felt a lot better, still with a slight headache no fever, and still feeling like im sweating on and off.

I parked my vehicle and didn?t feel well so I switched seats with my girl friend. As soon as I got into the passenger seat I was out. She said My eyes rolled back in my head and I started shaking and eyes at this point she said where going up down and side to side . She ran for help and after about 1-2 minutes I  woke up. I thought I passed out so I instantly put my feet on the dash of my car and the pharmacist gave me water and chocolate milk.  He then checked my heart rate it seemed good  and after 20 minutes he let us go home.

CMA noticed that continued to shake arm after 5 minutes but patient was alert and oriented x 3.  CMA thought the way he was shaking his arm seemed irregular so she advised pt he would be taken to an observation area for further observation.  Half way to the observation area, pt reported to CMA that he was seeing spots and felt like he was going to get sick.  CMA called for help.  Patient experienced a syncopal event just as he made it to the chair.  Several staff was helping to support patient.  Legs were lifted to another chair.  Patient was not responsive for a short time, very diaphoretic, breathing regular and unlabored.  Patients eyes then rolled upward toward the ceiling and patient&#39;s entire body began shaking uncontrollably while staff managed to keep patient from falling to floor from the chair.  Once patient was conscious, he was able to state his name but reported he was very confused and could not think clearly.  He was able to sit upright.  In the meantime while patient was shaking uncontrollably, staff sought urgent care provider to come and see patient.  Patient was then taken over to the urgent care side of the building to evaluate and treat patient.

I got up to go to the bathroom and upon finishing, I felt my heart rate skyrocket and felt faint. I immediately went back to the bed where I lost consciousness. My wife said my eyes were open and my body was rigid. I came too within a minute of that and was breathing heavy and sweating and very fatigued. My wife had called 911 as I was coming back to consciousness. The EMTs checked my vitals and all was normal. They asked if I wanted to go to the hospital, and I said no. My back was extremely sore all day, and I developed small red spots around my eyes. I went to my doctor later that day and told them about it. They took my blood for tests, which I have not heard back about, and they did not conclude anything, but did set me up with an appointment for an MRI of my head, given my past history.

For about 30 minutes I saw a white spot on the peripheral  view of my left eye.  By Monday, I felt dizzy and bottom right part of my chest hurt when taking deep breaths. The dizziness and chest pain lasted all week, still feel feel it today 4-18. My doctors office told me vertigo was a common side effect. On Thursday 4-15 every time I bent down and tried to get up, my right leg hurt as if I had exercised. At the moment I haven?t gone into work since Monday 4/12 since my job requires a lot of physical work.  I have mostly been home  resting  but don?t feel ready to go back to work. If someone  calls can it be a Spanish speaking person please.

He received the J&amp;J covid vaccine on 4/8 and felt well afterwards. Last Friday (4/16) he began to experience constitutional symptoms (fever to 100.4, chills, night sweats feeling drenched, decreased appetite) so decided to get his labs drawn as an outpatient for further evaluation. Symptoms progressed until Tuesday, when they began to subside slightly. At that point, his labs resulted and were notable for thrombocytopenia. He got his labs redrawn the day before admission and it was noted that his thrombocytopenia was worsening, so he was directed to the ED for further evaluation.  Patient seen by hematology, started on dexamethasone 40 mg PO daily as well as IVIG treatment x2. MRV of brain without evidence of dural venous sinus thrombosis  ***PATIENT CURRENTLY HOSPITALIZED***

I kept monitoring the patient and had slight rash on chest which went away and after 5 minutes time . Then started to feel  itchy but no rash appeared. after about 20 minutes didn&#39;t feel better so gave 25mg benadryl capsule and called 911. EMS took patient to the hospital because patient said tongue felt heavy.

It has been a whole weak and nothing major changed.  Since yesterday he has what they described in the beginning, depression in the left side of his heart, shortness of breath and rapid heart beat.  He has not called his doctor or gone to the ER.  He now has BP monitor and it has been morning, while on the phone he did his BP and it was 147/102.  This is a little bit lower than it has been.  Oxygen level right now is 98, BPM 97.

On closer inspection his eyes were closed, body limp, and head back.  We tried to ask if he was ok and grabbed his arm and held him up.  We were getting ready to place him on the ground and he regained consciousness.  Patient said after vaccine he became drowsy and sweaty. Incidence lasted 2 minutes and he stayed at the pharmacy for at least 30 minutes post vaccine.

                                                The first 15 minutes after the shot, I felt weak and a little dizzy. An hour later, I felt dizzier and my resting heartbeat was up to 75 bpm. My heart was racing and tingling, it felt like chills inside of my body. I became weaker and my heart jumped to 90 bpm. I became pale, disoriented, and my jaw tightened. I had no respiratory issues but I had a little troubling swallowing. I met with a Teladoc doctor who said that if I didn&#39;t get better by 6pm, to go to the ER. At 5:20, things calmed down and the reaction stopped. I felt very tired.

                                                After 5 mins of getting the vaccine, pt had a syncope and/or seizure episode.  Pt&#39;s eyes started to roll back and was only showing the white.  His hands were flinching into fist and pt was unresponsive.  This lasted about 20-30 secs.  We called ED and got the operator on the phone.  When we started to give the operator information, pt starts waking up.  Pt&#39;s mom didn&#39;t want the ambulance to come since pt is now awake so we told the operator everything is fine now and hung up.  Pt&#39;s forehead was sweaty and facial color was very pale.  We gave pt some water to drink and asked pt to continue to sit there and relax.  Pt has no idea of what happened he said he just remember one moment talking to his mom and the next moment she was holding him up.  Pt sat there for a total of about 1 hour and he said he was fine so they left.  We informed mom and pt to please go the UC or ER for follow up but they declined.  They said they will have him rest and hopefully things will be OK soon.  I checked his Blood pressure x 2 and both times they were good at around 128/87.  Gave mom my pharmacy business card to call with any further questions or concerns

I recovered well enough to drive home within 15 minutes afterwards. That night (10pm) I began shivering, which escalated to periods of convulsions, to which a mouth guard was needed to prevent chipping teeth and/or biting my tongue. There was no fever present, and to subside the uncontrollable shivering I sat in a very hot shower until motor functions gradually returned. Periods of headaches, joint pains and sweating ensued for the remainder of the night. There were no other symptoms in the following days.

                                                After vaccination, patient appeared to be slouched over in chair in observation area.  Two bystanders approached him and held him to prevent him from falling from his chair. Patient was diaphoretic and eyes half-closed. Attempt was made to arouse patient by talking to him and rubbing chest. His head and body moved erratically for approx. 3 seconds.  Patient was lowered to the floor. Nurse continued speaking to patient and rubbing his chest.  He then opened his eyes and was startled. Patient abruptly sat up and said, ?what happened and where is my phone?? The nurse reassured him he was being taken care of and she asked if he knew where he was?  Patient replied, ?I have no idea.?  A paramedic approached and asked the patient if he knew his name.  The patient correctly replied. The patient had no recollection of what had taken place, but did know where he was. Patient was then evaluated by the paramedics.  All tests performed were normal and patient refused to be transported to hospital.  Patient was driven home by his wife.  Follow up phone call to patient yesterday evening with no answer.  Follow up phone call to wife (listed as emergency contact), 4/7 at approx. 6 pm.  Per wife, patient experiencing fatigue and still very pale. She said he just wasn?t himself. Patient was concerned that they did not know what to expect a week or two from now.   I advised patient that if she had concerns, she needed to have patient evaluated in ER.

                                                BLOOD CLOTS IN LEFT LUNG; TIRED; FEVERISH; This spontaneous report received from a consumer concerned a 34 year old male. The patient&#39;s weight was 175 pounds, height was 67 inches and Body mass index (NR: not provided) 27.4. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included non smoker, no personal or family history of clotting disorders and no recent trauma or travel. The patient was active and ran for 30 mins every day. The patient received COVID-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of administration not reported, batch number: 043AZ1A or 043A21A) frequency one total, dose was not reported, administered on 05-APR-2021 at 10:15 hours in left arm for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 05-APR-2021 in the evening, the patient experienced &#34;normal side effects&#34;, specifically tiredness and fever (temperature was not taken) and he took 2 Advil and went to bed. On 06-APR-2021 in the morning, he felt back to his normal baseline. On an unspecified date of APR-2021 (08-APR-2021 or 09-APR-2021), he felt pain and tightness in his chest and difficulty breathing. He noticed that he had to work harder to do his daily run. On 13-APR-2021, when the symptoms did not improve, he went to the emergency room. The patient had blood was taken (results not reported). A computerised tomography (CT) scan showed 2 blood clots in the left lung and duplex scans of both legs did not reveal a clot. A chest x-ray was done but results not provided. The patient&#39;s COVID-19 test was negative, and he was admitted to the hospital and treated with intravenous heparin. It was reported that no oxygen was given. On 14-APR-2021, he was discharged with Eliquis which he should continue for 6 months.  On 16-APR-2021, the chest pain was gone, and his breathing was better in the morning but still difficult later in the day. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from tired, and feverish, and was recovering from blood clots in left lung. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This 34 year-old overweight male (BMI 27.4) was hospitalized for 2 blood clots in his left lung 8 days after receiving vaccination with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. He had no chronic medical conditions, was a nonsmoker, no personal or family history of clotting disorders, no recent trauma or travel, and exercised every day. On the evening of his vaccination, he felt tired and fever (temperature not taken) and took 2 ibuprofen and went to bed. The following morning, he felt back to normal. Two or three days later, he felt pain/tightness in his chest and difficulty breathing; he found it more difficult to perform his daily exercise. Eight days after vaccination, when his symptoms did not improve, he went to the emergency department where a CT scan showed 2 blood clots in his left lung. Covid-19 testing and duplex scans of his legs were negative. Blood tests were performed but results were unknown. He was hospitalized for 1 night, treated with IV heparin, and discharged the following day with apixaban. As of the time of this report, the chest pain had resolved and breathing was improved in the morning but still difficult later in the day. Based on the limited information (e.g. absence of blood test results), the relationship with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine is considered indeterminant.

I Went to bed and woke up at 16:25. 30 min later I slept again for about 90 min. Then I woke up and walked outside for some fresh air and got this extreme ice pick pain in the left side of my head for a few seconds. Then a few seconds later again. Now it just nags a bit behind my left eye and it feels a bit off in the left side of my brain. Bright lights hurt a bit. My back pain and Sciatica is also a lot higher than normal.

T&#43; 2 days - 7 days: fever subsides, hot flashes increase in intensity significantly, continuing to interfere with sleep. Other possible androgenic symptoms begin to arise: change in body odor, sex drive, motivations, appetite. T&#43; 7 days till current: previous symptoms of days 2-7 continue, extremely gradual onset headache begins one night. Making sure to rule out hydration and electrolyte imbalance expecting headache to be gone in the morning after sleep, I found that it was only worse and that an interpolation of the two pain points from when I went to sleep and woke up would have created a almost imperceptibly gradual but linear increase between the two points. The headache was of a type I had never had before, located in the center of my head just barely dorsal to the spinal insertion. It felt deeper than any headache I had had before which usually occur in the frontal lobe/neocortex zone. I do not regularly suffer headaches getting maybe a couple per year. Once I recognized androgenic involvement and the headache were continuing I took myself to the ER where I was evaluated and despite presenting with continuous hypertension and the symptoms mentioned above, I could not get them to perform a estrogen test and they let me leave with hypertension without any investigation. I&#39;m returning today to their urgent care facility to try again to get my estrogen levels checked. I had left a message on the phone line of VAERS prior to the original ER visit but had not heard back from anyone so I felt it was prudent to file a written report here.

                                                Started experiencing extreme chest pains (stabbing feeling) between my lower right breast and upper rib cage on Saturday afternoon, especially when trying to take a big inhale. I went to the emergency room the next day after pain meds (ibprofen) did not help, and they did an EKG and X-Ray and they said it was a muscle strain. I went home and alternated between 3000 MGs of Tylenol every 24 hours, 2400 MGs of Ibuprofen, 8 hours of 4% lidocaine patch and then off for 8 hours &#43; and a heating pad when the patch was off. The pain in my chest got worse and worse on Mon and Tue (started having spasms in the chest that caused extreme sharp shooting pain down my back up into my head) so went back into the ER Tues night.

                                                Patient was advised to remain in observation area for 30 minutes due to history of breathing difficulty with sulfa antibiotics in past. Shortly after being vaccinated the patient presented to our service window stating he did not feel well and was immediately escorted by the pharmacist to our administration area to have a seat. He stated he felt light headed, flushed (though not visibly), felt like his heart was racing, and was not having diffuculty breathing but felt like he couldn&#39;t catch his breath and stated he thought he was having a panic attack. He had stated before vaccination that he had not had a vaccine since his routing childhood schedule, his whole family had already had doses, and he had been putting it off because he was nervous. He insisted he needed some fresh air several times and was escorted outside by the pharmacist (with emergency supplies and a cell phone and within shouting distance of the pharmacy) for continued obsevation and was given water when requested. After a few minutes he stated he felt much better and the symptoms had resoved. He was directly observed outside per his request for the remainder of his waiting period and had no further symptoms. He was instructed to call the pharmacy right away if he had any additional symptoms after leaving.

He was also feeling bad a couple of days after the vaccine. After the stroke he is now paralyzed on his right side.

                                                Immediate pain in the arm after the injection and it still hurts 4 days later. Every arm movement causes pain. About 8 hours after the injection, I could feel my heart rate rising. I tried to sleep and experienced disturbed sleep. At 3:00 am I woke up and felt terrible. I checked my blood pressure, and it was normal at 105/61, but my heart rate was 99. My resting heart rate is typically  about 50. My heart rate doubling provided a terrible sensation. I could barely walk and shuffled around outside to get some fresh air. 3 hours later, my heart rate started coming back down but took a day to get back to normal. Even now, I have lost my appetite, am not eating much, and I just slept 16 hours. I have never experienced any vaccine such as this.

One nurse raised his legs &amp; another put a pulse oximeter on patient &amp; took his BP. Patient started responding to verbal cues. A nurse gave him Gatorade to start drinking. He was drenched in sweat from head to feet. The nurse continued to take his BP, which did hit 120/~70, but then dipped again. Once his BP &amp; pulse stabilized, he was able to go home. Patient ate a full meal &amp; a non-diet soda. He reported being exhausted ~4 pm. He fell asleep &amp; rose once to urinate.  Dr. at a Family Medicine practice checked his heart and lungs, and confirmed this did not appear to be an allergic reaction, but more likely was a vagovasal reaction. Patient started reacting ~10 minutes after the injection.

                                                After giving the vaccine, I was talking with the patient and he said he felt dizzy. He passed out and while he was out/when he was regaining consciousness, he started having seizure like movement. EMS was called and were here within 5 minutes. The paramedics took his vitals which were all WNL. Approximately 15  minutes later, the patient had a repeat episode. The paramedics and I suggested that the patient go to the emergency room via ambulance. He declined and left with his wife. They both reported that he would seek care at the emergency room.

Patient laid to floor with knees up and hands behind head. The patient came to rather quickly. The EMS squad was called and they took over with blood pressure and portable EKG machine. The patient had a gatorade and rested for about an hour and his wife drove him home. I called him 2 days later to check in on his status and he said he got a good nights sleep and felt much better with just a sore arm.

Everything was normal and I was sent home to monitor.  I continued having chest pain 4/14-4/17.  On 4/17 I was having chest pain and then started having numbness in the left side of my face.  I proceeded to have left sided weakness,  difficulty speaking, slurred speech, and loss of motor skills.  I was taken to the ER.  They did a CT scan, blood work, and an ekg.  All were normal.  I was admitted to the hospital and they did MRI or the head, MRA of the neck, MRI of the neck and spine, Echocardiogram, Stress test, and further blood work.  Everything came back normal.  I saw Neurology inpatient and was discharged to follow up outpatient.  I still have coordination  difficulty and I do not have all of my motor skills back yet.

This is a 35-year-old male with complex past medical history including bilateral lung transplant and renal transplant performed several years ago.  He both of them and regarding his transplant management.  He is on immunosuppressive medications.  He is here today out of concern for exposure to COVID.  He was vaccinated with Johnson Johnson vaccine on  3/4.  He is here cause overnight he started developed fever headache sore throat muscle aches.  If continued through today.  He was test in the outpatient setting but the results have not yet returned.  He is here today with continued symptoms.  He is well-appearing on exam but mildly tachycardic, low-grade temperature here no significant increased work of breathing no conversational dyspnea lungs are clear heart is regular but tachycardic without murmur he has no signs or symptoms of DVT currently.  His chest x-ray shows all isolated left lower lobe infiltrate.  His labs are unremarkable with normal renal function, normal electrolytes but is rapid COVID test is positive.  Given his immunosuppressive status in infiltrate seen on x-ray initially recommended admission for observation even though he is not initially on any supplemental oxygen is work of breathing is quite comfortable.  I was able to discuss with his transplant surgeon In addition I talked to admitting physician who then discussed with pulmonology here .  In their opinion the best management for the patient would be to provide him with the monoclonal antibody treatment but this can only be performed in the outpatient setting given he has no increased work of breathing no supple ox requirement currently that he is stable for discharge.  He has a pulse monitor at home will also enroll him in a COVID home program.  Pulmonology will call him for follow-up tomorrow.  When I discussed with  they currently do not have any beds available at the hospital for transport.  The patient does not want to go to an outside facility that has a transplant team other than the risks of.  Ultimately the patient would like to go home.  I will add doxycycline for bacterial possibility of his pneumonia seen on x-ray today.  He also had very strict return precautions.  He understands likely had a possibility of worsening symptoms understands to return immediately if any new or worsening symptoms or no improvement.

Chills and body aches continued. I didn?t feel like I could get warm. Slept on and off throughout the night. Woke up 16 hours after injection and chills were gone and had night sweats. Still really achy all over.  Woke up 20 hours after injection and still had body aches and felt groggy.  Body aches turned into joint aches and still continue 48 hours after injection.  Minor injection site pain started approximately 36 hours after injection.

                                                During the evening around 6pm after I started developing symptoms consistent with the flu.    Fever reached 104 around 8pm.  Uncontrollable chills also were present.  A severe headache followed.  I took fever reducing meds immediately. Confusion and trouble breathing happened during the fever and chills period.  An attempt to go to the hospital was unsuccessful because I lost consciousness while attempting to find phone/car keys.   After I woke up, I felt less confused and could catch my breath, so I decided to take more fever reducing meds and see how I felt in a few hours - this was around 11pm.  Around midnight my fever broke and the chills stopped, but the headache was at the worst it&#39;s been. The headache lasted the entire next day as well.      I wanted to go to the doctor, but was physically unable to and had no one to alert.  I do feel better today.  I have some weak headaches that come and go, along with muscle aches, but I feel that they are minor enough.

I went to the the emergency room and they did some tests and the results were normal. I have been taking some Tylenol and it helped a little. It has been four weeks and I still get the pain intermittently for a couple of hours every day and it is mostly in my back. It is a little less frequent but not much better.

                                                The patient walked in to the pharmacy for a Janssen Covid vaccination along with family. Patient was advised post vaccination administration to sit in observation for 15 minutes but did not comply and as he was walking away from the pharmacy fainted. Parents reported he did not hit his head and pharmacy was alerted post fall of what had happened. We approached the patient as he was getting to his feet and we advised again for him to come back to pharmacy to sit in a chair for further observation. His parents told us he always has fainting issues post any vaccination or blood work (no prior issue reported to vaccinations on consent form). The patient continued to decline going back to pharmacy and as he walked fainted again, he was able to hold on to shopping cart which lessened severity of fall. Pharmacy staff advised him to remain on floor and after he regained consciousness he was able to answer accurately his name, where he was and what day of week it was. At that time a nurse not employed by Company was shopping near by and began to help care for the patient. The patient and his parents continued to decline calling an ambulance, and after several minutes sat against a wall. He was starting to sweat profusely and heart rate was rapid (approximately 145 bpm per nurse) so we had him remove his coat and provided a cool compress for his head and neck. He was breathing rapidly but was able to slow his respiration upon our direction. The patient did not seem to be improving and the nurse helping advised calling EMS which we did. The patient continued to lose consciousness for brief periods awaiting and during EMS aid. EMS ran the patients blood pressure, blood sugar nd ran an ECG prior to taking patient away to hospital (results unknown to pharmacy as we stayed in area to provide information on patient vaccination administration but had no active assistance  care at that time.

                                                Symptoms started ~10 minutes after injection.  I began to feel dizzy.  I felt very warm and began to sweat profusely.  My vision got cloudy.  I was given water.  The pharmacist measured my blood pressure, and I believe he said I was 70 over 50.  I began to feel like I was about to pass out, so I laid down and gradually began to improve.  I began to feel very cold instead of very warm.  About thirty minutes later, I felt well enough to leave the pharmacy.  After a couple hours, I began to experience what I think are more typical symptoms - stiffness and pain in the arm which received the shot, and chills.  The next day, I experienced sore wrists, shins, and lower back; fatigue; headache; and hot &amp; cold flashes with uncontrollable shivering or sweating at times.  These symptoms were alleviated about 42 hours after the injection, except for persisting mild pain in the arm had which received the shot.

                                                On April 19th, 16 days after vaccine administered, massive headaches began that left me bed ridden for roughly 2 weeks to a month afterwards. Severe headaches lasted all day with no breaks. Only relief I would have would be from laying down with head in a certain position.   A month after initial symptoms, the pain started to subside, but very slowly, taking several more weeks to calm down and to feel reduction in pain. Pressure would also set in around brain when pain was becoming less.  Several tests had been done after symptoms began which included: Bloodwork Lipid CT Scan without contrast CT Scan with contrast MRI without contrast  On June 15th, I was notified by my Neurologist that the MRI, which had been performed on June 10th, had showed a mild stroke had recently occurred.  I am now on blood pressure medication, as well as aspirin 81, reduce the likelihood of another stroke.

I was sweating profusely, experience nausea and then fainted and had a mild seizure. After coming to consciousness, I vomited and the pharmacy staff called the paramedics. I was extremely pale and the fever persisted for several minutes while waiting for the paramedics. I recovered and felt mostly normal after being given saline solution and anti-nausea medication. Hours after being released from the hospital, I have waves of cold chills and hot flashes.

He started feeling sick and got up to go to the restroom. On his way to the restroom, he passed out and fell in the hallway. We then got him to a seat and gave him some water and orange juice. The patient was adamant that we not call an ambulance for him, so we made the patient stay seating under our direct supervision. He sat in the waiting room for about an hour until someone could come to pick him up. By the time someone arrived to take him home, he seemed to be doing much better.

There was no blood in my pee or discoloration however I had to clean my penis tip with a tissue and noticed a blood cloth came out while I was wiping. This concerns me but that was the only time I saw blood, there was none afterward nor has it occur since then.

                                                Patient went to the hospital Monday.  He received the Janssen single-dose Covid vaccine on Thursday, April 8 and by Saturday, April 10 he was starting to develop fairly significant peripheral edema without any breathing  difficulties.  This  persisted and was worse by Monday, April 13  EKG showed global nonspecific T-wave abnormalities and ST segment changes so I had him sent to the ER. As it turned out he had a pancytopenia (mostly neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) so he was admitted to the hospital. This seemed to resolve pretty much on its own and so they attributed everything to his hepatitis C. Indeed his LFTs are elevated in the 300 range and imaging showed  hepatosplenomegaly.  they also did a bone marrow biopsy for which there are no results yet

Per admission note: Patient is a 36YO male with a history of HFrEF s/p heartware 12/17/14, ICM with embolic MI, CAD, chronic driveline infection, HTN, HLD, DM type II, SVT, obesity, gout who was sent to the hospital for bilateral PEs. Patient called our OP line on 04/17 complaining of fever of 102 and chills. He was instructed to go to local lab and get labs done. They drew basic labs as well as blood cultures. On Sunday, the patient reported his fever was gone and he felt better. Today, he was feeling SOB and presented to his PCP. They ordered a CTA which reportedly showed bilateral PEs. They sent him to the local ED who transferred him here. Of note, his INR has been supratherapeutic for several weeks and pharmacy has been adjusting his warfarin dosing. The patient tested COVID negative prior to transfer. The vaccine lot number information is not accessible to this reporter.

It&#39;s been as high as 161/107 and then the lowest it&#39;s been 136/87 - a lot of 140&#39;s or 130&#39;s over low 90&#39;s or 100&#39;s..  My pulse is high, too. Pulse has been running 104 and 133 for pulse. My primary put me on a blood pressure medication. It doesn&#39;t seem to be helping with the symptoms. Doctors have been running bloodwork for kidney function. The nephrologist I&#39;ve been seeing.

While texting her, I started experiencing color distortions and the next thing I knew was the Pharmacist was asking if I could breathe and they laid me down on the floor and called 911. The Fire Department arrived and took my blood pressure and I tried to walk out and the next thing I knew was that I was weak; therefore, the Ambulance transported me to the hospital. In the ER they examine me and ended up giving me a nausea pill after observing me for two hours.

Extreme mental fog during 24-48 hours after vaccine injection.  After initial 48 hours after vaccine injection, experienced tightness in chest with a slight bias to left side.  Also still experiencing very faint feeling of headache since injection.  This seems to cause slight mental fog and has remained as of writing this 2 weeks after injection.  At 72 hours after injection, tightness or pressure moved across entire upper chest collar area, and down left arm and up left side of head behind left ear and into the back of the head, and then finally to the top of the head.  Pressure/Tightness discomfort seems to effect left hand nerves... effecting typing  on keyboard with left hand fingers.  Pressing on left and right collar bone pectoral areas exacerbates irritation.

                                                Patient came in for Janssen COVID vaccine that was scheduled electronically online.  All appropriate prescreening was done and patient had no previous allergies or issues.  Patient was instructed to sit in one of the chairs designated for post vaccine observation.  Within minutes (less than 3), patient was very dizzy, clammy (cold sweats), pale and said he did not feel right.  I assisted him to a sitting position on the floor from his chair and we were able to ease him back to a lying down position from there with his head on the floor and feet elevated above heart on a chair.  Patient said that the cold floor actually made him feel better instantly.  At 4:18pm after lying down for about 3 minutes we checked his blood pressure with him still lying down.  It was 110/88 and pulse of 104 (so slightly elevated pulse).  He said he was feeling better and we kept him lying down.  Patient&#39;s wife was also there so she was able to provide information in addition to him doing it also.  She did state that he occasionally had panic attacks and she thought this might be one, the patient was adamant that it was not.  At 4:24 pm we checked his blood pressure again and it was 100/90 and Pulse of 104.  He was feeling quite a bit better so we had him come to a sitting position on the floor and he had not eaten in a while so we got him a granola bar and water.  Pt slowly ate these and begin to feel clammy and sweaty again within 3-4 minutes. We checked his blood pressure again and it was 104/90 and pulse of 100.  He wanted to stay sitting to see if it would pass.  We did continuously observe injection site and screen for any other symptoms of an allergic reaction (nausea, cramping, swelling, and none of these were occurring). Since he was still not feeling well we gave the patient 50mg of benadryl (20 mls of 12.5mg/5ml liquid benadryl) with his approval. After about 10 minutes of sitting total he was still having cold sweats and feeling dizzy so we had him lie back on his back with his feet elevated while the benadryl kicked in.  By 4:50pm he was feeling well enough to sit back up and we got him some wraps and a coke from the cafe to eat.  Pt continued to consistently improve and was ready to leave about 5:20pm.  We advised him and his wife of signs and symptoms of allergic reaction and to have those treated to immediately at urgent care or and ER.   We also told him to follow-up with his PCP.  I had a manager help walk them to their car.  They were very kind and grateful.  I will follow-up with a call tomorrow and again on Friday to make sure he continues to do well.

                                                Seven days after vaccine was administered Patient started having symptoms of difficulty breathing, rapid heart rate, and breaking out in a rash all over  his torso and upper arms.  His lips also got quite swollen.  The rash eventually spread down both his legs.  He was taken to the emergency room at Hospital, as he was visiting there at the time.  He was given benadryl, and prednisone once his Covid test came back negative.  Blood work, chest x-ray, CT scan of both stomach and chest, EKG and blood work all came back normal.  His resting heart rate was 120 and above, and he required two liters of oxygen to stay in the mid 90&#39;s saturation level.  He spent five days in the hospital before the rash was mostly faded on his torso and his lip swelling had come down.  He was discharged on 3/24/21 with the advice to see his primary care physician, and to be monitored carefully for oxygen saturation and heart rate.  The family could not think of anything he had eaten or come in contact with that would have caused any reaction.  At this time we think it was a reaction to his Janssen vaccine based on all the tests at the hospital coming back normal.

One week ago, on Friday, March 26, he received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine for Covid 19. That day he felt fine. The following day he had some muscle aches. Sunday he states he had some slight shortness of breath, only for that day. Then he had some fever and chills feeling. That resolved. The only symptoms that persisted was his muscle aching and tightness. Then yesterday, the day of his presentation to the ER, he noted some bilateral lower extremity edema which prompted his visit. He is feeling mostly fine except a bit of muscle tightness. BNP was 154. Chest x-ray showed pneumonitis. He received antibiotics. Echocardiogram was completed showing preliminary findings of small to moderate pericardial effusion and trace aortic insufficiency.  Will treat with colchicine and ibuprofen.

                                                JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE EUA  I received the vaccine on 3rd April, 2021, at approximately 9:30 am. There were no immediate side effects. Approximately 10 hours later I began to feel EXTREME cold and chills. So much so that I had to put on 3 layers of clothing, socks and cover myself with 3-4 blankets. I also experienced a fever and body soreness. My wife tended to me with two ibuprofen tablets, 200 mg each and continually to put cold presses on my forehead. I drank a lot of water but my fever continued to spike to 102.8. The symptoms continued for another 3 hours. Out of concern we called the emergency room to ask if we should be concerned about the fever. We were advised to take two Tylenol tablets. My wife gave me two Tylenol PM tablets. About 30 mins after taking the Tylenol tablets and continuing to hydrate, my cold and chills began to subside and I began to shed all of my layers. About 30 minutes after that, my fever levelled out to abougt 100.8. Then I passed out. The following morning, I woke up with cold, chills and fever gone. I had a mild headache and took 2 Extra Strength Tylenol tablets. It&#39;s been four hours since then and I feel fine, just a little weak.

                                                patient got his vaccine, put his shirt back on and buttoned it up and asked if it should be sore already.  I told him, yes the shot may cause some discomfort after injection and he was standing at this point.  He was about to say something and he fell backwards and hit a mobile laptop cart and the wall.  The patient went unconscious not talking but breathing was given an epipen and 911 called vaccine given a few minutes before 12:30 and 911 called at 12:29.  He regained consciousness fairly quickly and was assessed by the pharmacist and then EMT and transported to the hospital for monitoring.

The patient was slumped in the chair and then brought to the ground. An EpiPen was administered and 911 was called. The EMTs then came and did an assessment as the patient was able to then sit up. They took him to the hospital for further observation.

Emergency services were contacted; EKG was normal and patient did not need to report to hospital for further care. Patient felt better approximately 45  minutes post vaccination and left at that time.

About 3-4 minutes after his vaccine, he slumped over in the chair and was unresponsive. The pharmacist and store manager stayed with him as a technician called 911. He was unresponsive for about 30 seconds before he came to but then continued to go in and out of consciousness for the next couple of minutes. He said he had a history of dizziness after vaccines. When he was finally able to hold a conversation with us, he said he felt hot and we gave him a cold bottle to put on his head until the paramedics arrived. His blood pressure was 100/50 when the paramedics arrived about 7-10 minutes after we called and patient was fully responsive then. Paramedics continued to monitor him and followed him home to make sure he was okay.

While attempting to go to the bathroom, I must have passed out because I woke up some time later on the floor with a busted face and nose, and a severe headache.  Initially the day after the shot, I had sharp shooting pains down my right leg. I have also had a headache on more days since getting the vaccine.  Mental fog and tiredness is also occurring a few days after the initial shot.

I asked if he had ever had a problem after a vaccine, and he said that he fainted once after a vaccine more than 20 years ago. (He claimed on question 4 of the questionnaire that he had never fainted after a vaccine.) I had him call for a ride home and for someone to pick up his car. He waited another 45 minutes and left. I checked on him frequently throughout the hour he was here and he reported he was fine each time.

                                                On Saturday 3/20 I experienced the usual symptoms that were noted. On Monday 3/22 I began to get very dizzy with a heart rate of 150bpm. My blood pressure went up to 210/138 which is extremely abnormal for me. I began to tremor uncontrollably. I thought it was an anxiety attack so I took my Xanax. .50mg. That did not work at all. I experienced nausea and stomach pain. I called 911 and was taken to the hospital where after 4 hours I started feeling better. Tuesday I continued to have tremors. Wednesday the rapid heart rate, stomach pain, and nausea returned. The rest of the week did not get any better. On Saturday 3/27 I slept all day long which again is not normal for me at all. At this point we are 1 full week into the vaccine administration. On Sunday 3/28 I bagan to have the same feeling as the prior Tuesday. Sweating, couldn&#39;t breath, heart rate hit 170 this time. BP was the same, tremors, stomach pain, nausea, dizzyness, and this time my Carbon Dioxide level dropped to 24. This morning 3/29 I woke up with extreme tremors. No dizzyness.

                                                While sitting down during the post-vaccination period, patient asked his wife for water about 10 minutes after receiving vaccine. Pharmacy staff provided water and pharmacist went over to check on the patient. Patient expressed feeling &#34;hot&#34; and wanted an ice-pack, which was given. Patient expressed feeling &#34;faint,&#34; after which he briefly lost consciousness. Pharmacist immediately started checking for pulse and obtained Emergency Kit. Patient regained consciousness quickly without need of CPR or administration of Emergency Kit medications. At some point patient also released his bladder,  most likely during the syncope episode. Patient expressing feeling &#34;nauseous&#34; and asked for something to throw up in. Pharmacist quickly got a trash can and gave to patient, shortly after which patient started vomiting. Pharmacist was attending to patient and asked patient if he wanted 911 to be called, to which he replied &#34;No&#34; and that he just needed some time to sit. Patient also stated he did not eat much that day. Pharmacist offered Pedialyte, to which patient agreed, in order to replenish fluids/electrolytes lost due to vomiting. Patient also asked for some crackers since he did not eat much earlier. After taking sips of Pedialyte and taking bites of crackers, patient could not hold anything down and continued to vomit. At that time patient&#39;s wife asked pharmacy staff to proceed with calling 911. 911 was called and paramedics took patient&#39;s vitals upon arrival at the scene. Vitals were all stated to be normal. Patient agreed to be taken by ambulance to the hospital. A couple hours later patient&#39;s wife informed pharmacy staff that patient was doing much better and was expected to be released from hospital soon. Before receiving vaccination, patient did share that in the past he had &#34;felt faint&#34; when giving blood but it was not made clear that patient had felt faint or fainted during vaccinations prior. After the incident patient&#39;s wife confirmed that patient had fainted in the past both after giving blood and after receiving vaccinations. Pharmacist called patient at 9:12 AM the following day (4/3/21) to see how patient was doing but was only able to leave a voicemail message.

                                                Approximately ten minutes after receiving the vaccination I got very dizzy and passed out. I was out for 3-4 minutes and came to. Subsequent to passing out I vomited a few times and could not hold anything down. I also urinated on myself at some point when out. I was not getting better so 911 was called and I was transported to the emergency room via ambulance. Once the ambulance arrived at the hospital I vomited again filling about half of the vomit bag. I arrived at the hospital and an IV was not able to be administered so I was given Zofran for nausea and Gatorade to try and hold down. I spent approximately 4 hours in the ER, was able to finally get to the point where the nausea calmed down and I was able to walk around. I was then discharged.

At 1:30am, I woke up needing to urinate. I went into the bathroom and lost consciousness, finding myself with one hand in the toilet and one on the side. I felt nauseous and thought I would vomit, but didn&#39;t and believe I lost consciousness again. I was able to make it to the sink to try to wash my hands, and I fell down on my knees. I knew I was bleeding somewhere but didn&#39;t know from where (my right pinky was cut on an item in the bathroom when I fell). My wife made it to me, and I lost consciousness a couple more times while talking with her. I laid on the bathroom floor for a

Of note, patient states he had not had anything to eat all day and only had some coffee. Paramedics onsite took vitals which were, BP 98/60, Pulse 50 bpm, O2 100%. Patient noted that he was an active runner, but stats were not typical. Paramedics noted that patient was ?very pale? and was still light headed 30 minutes after receiving the vaccine. After consultation with paramedics and patient, it was agreed to transport because of low vitals and no change in status. Patient was transported to local hospital and because of transport protocols, an IV of 90% NaCL was started.

When I awoke I was still sweating and cold for the next five to ten minutes.  Paramedics checked my vital signs onsite afterwards (blood pressure, sugar levels, and pulse) and everything appeared to be normal.  I was able to drive home 30 minutes later after making sure that all side effects subsided.  I have not experienced any other side effects from the vaccine.

                                                Hi I was vaccinated Thursday April 8th 2021 at approximately 9:15am. I kept a log so I could share my experience with my friends and family. After vaccination I was fine for a few hours but I randomly got a case of  watery eyes that would last about 15 minutes and then clear up. This happened 4 times over a 9 hour period. Around 9 hours after vaccination I started to feel like I had a cold and my skin all over my body ached to touch and my heart started racing. I felt sunburned and nauseous and went to bed. 13 hours exactly after vaccination I was hit hard with intense chills to the point of teeth chattering and full body shivering. 15 hours after injection I woke up intensely hot and I had a massive headache, full body pain, a tickle deep in my lungs that made me cough, nausea, and a fever of 101. I also was having extreme heart palpitations. I have a laser thermometer and I discovered my fever was 101.5 at my forehead but my neck and chest were 103. I took ibuprofen and kept patting myself with cold wet wash cloths to combat the fever. At this point I debated going to the hospital. I had intense fatigue and I was too weak to move but too sick to sleep. This level of fever and symptoms went on for about a day and a half. Since my vaccination I am still fatigued, I get winded very easily, something small like feeding my dog makes me break out in a sweat, and I need to lay down. I am still weak and fatigued but not to the same level as before and it changes every day. I have a sore throat, headaches, occasionally my body will twitch in random places, fever will pop up and go away, I cough gag and get very weak under any physical stress. I did not have injection site pain out of the ordinary until 48 hours after injection and it felt like a shotgun blast to the arm.. I did have very unusual joint pain from the start. I was injected in my upper left arm, but my lower right ankle was painful and my left wrist...    I am a 38 year old male with treated hypertension, obesity and sleep apnea. My mother who is 65 was vaccinated at the same time as myself and her symptoms were slow onset and much milder than mine but she too has headaches, upset stomach, fatigue, watery eyes, fever, chills, twitches, injection pain, etc.

Rph had reviewed information on consent form including whether he had had any adverse effects to a vaccine that required immediate medical care. His notation on the consent form and verbal information provided to rph prior to injection was no. Immediately after the injection is when he said he should have mentioned that he has fainted in the past when receiving an immunization. EMS was contacted to assess patient and whether it was safe for him to leave pharmacy. EPS monitored blood pressure and other vitals and patient said he felt well enough to leave on his own after 30 minutes observation by rph

                                                Flu like symptoms with severe stabbing chest pain. Started to feel achy and a twinge in chest around 12:30 am, went to sleep, woke up at 2 am with severe stabbing pains in chest that would come and go. Took some Advil around 3:15am and within a half hour flu like symptoms stopped but not chest pains. The chest pain were less severe. Continues to feel a  slight twinge and slight aching in chest 4 days later.

About a day or two later, I developed a chronic cough that is still currently persisting.  After seeing my doctor on Sat 4/17, I was prescribed an Albuterol inhaler for asthma, which has been dormant for years.   The coughing is continuous, and at times strong/violent.  On the morning of Tues 4/20 I had coughed up a little bit of blood after the coughing had persisted for about 5 or 10 minutes.  Asthma, chronic cough, and  coughing up blood are not typical/documented side effects of received the Covid vaccine.  My asthma has been dormant for years, and prior to this event, I have not had instances of chronic cough or coughing up blood.

                                                On April 8, 2021, I received the J&amp;J vaccine. Initially, I only had the chills and body aches. Then, on Monday April 12, 2021, I went to the gym where I worked out. When I came home and after showering, I returned a phone call shortly after 8 P.M. While speaking on the phone, I could tell after a few minutes of talking something was off, and then all of a sudden, the words stopped coming out. After a few more seconds, I was trying to yell upstairs to my wife for help. I sounded like a goat while trying to yell that word. I then snapped out of it, and was able to speak clearly and normal again. I told my wife and called back my friend. My friend said I sounded like I was getting sick when I had the attack. The next morning I went to the hospital. I was diagnosed with a Transient Ischemic Attack &#34;TIA.&#34;

                                                Patient received vaccine and immediately felt light-headed and faint. He turned white upon standing and sat back down. He continued to have labored breathing and starting sweating. We were monitoring him and he informed us that it was anxiety related. He couldn&#39;t move his hands and started blacking out. When EMT arrived he started to feel better. They were able to rule out an allergic reaction and it was most likely anxiety related. Patient refused to go to the hospital and was walked out by EMT to make sure he could drive home.

                                                description from patient:  1.. On Wed, Apr 28, I got the JnJ vaccine. Other than fatigue the following day no major issues.  2. On Sat, May 1, I had an afib episode in the morning. Reset to sinus rhythm the next morning around 2:30am. I spoke with you during the episode.   3. On Mon, May 3, I had brain fog. I?m usually tired after an afib episode. But this seemed different. I?ve never experienced something like this before. But I chalked it out to the after effects of the afib and moved on. 4. On Fri, May 7, I started having the stiffness in my right calf. I checked in with you that weekend to make sure it wasn?t a clot. After we spoke I think we ruled out a clot.  5. In addition, I?ve developed some added symptoms since then: (i) Sweaty feet. (ii) Pins and needles sensation in feet.  (iii) Tightness in the arch of the right foot. (iv) Feet and hands feel sensitive to cold.  (v) Burning sensation in feet and left hand.  (vi) Mild headache mostly felt in the left temple.  (vii) A pulling feeling on the left side of the face. (viii) A feeling that if I close my eyes, I may faint.

A week later, I went to ER - I was still having short term memory loss, chest pain and body aches and joint pains I have been scheduled for a Rheumatologist; Neurologist.  I&#39;m still taking prednisone until I can get to the Rheumatologist. As long as I&#39;m on the prednisone, I&#39;m all right but as soon as I come off it I get symptoms back of pressure in my head, all my joints start hurting and have short term memory loss.

                                                The patient felt some lightheadedness and dizziness post vaccination. While talking with the patient he began to collapse in his chair. The pharmacist held the patient up in the chair while the event occurred. The patient came back to within about 30 seconds of the event starting and was unaware that he had lost consciousness for a short period of time. At this time he was given some water and a cool pack to rest on his neck. He was then given some orange juice. He began to feel better and moved himself from the vaccination room to a post-vaccination waiting chair in view of the pharmacy. He was able to walk under his own power to the chair and remained seated for the duration of his post-vaccination wait time. Upon completion of his wait time the patient left on his own and said that he was feeling well and able to go.

Patient sat in immunization booth for a total of 35 minutes and was given something to eat and drink, as he had nothing to eat yet for the day and only had caffeine and nicotine in his system.  Patient started to feel less shaky but was still light headed.  It was suggested we call the paramedics for evaluation and he refused, and then left the pharmacy 35 minutes after vaccine (against pharmacist advise).  The patient called approximately 2 hours later and said he was feeling better, no longer shaky or light headed and had a headache as the only symptom at the time.

As I was sitting in the monitoring area, I was completely fine and then a wave came crushing down on me and I was out for about 5 minutes.  The nurses said it looked like I was having a seizure.  The EMTs called it a syncope event.  I am a member of the military and and have been pumped full of vaccines.  I get my annual flu shot every year.  I have survived 6 rounds of Anthrax vaccines and every other vaccine the military has pumped into me.  This is the First Time I  have ever REACTED this way.  It was CRAZY!

                                                I administered a Janssen covid imz to patient at 1:07pm. Immediately following the patient proceeded to faint, his head fell back and limps went limp. I called for pharmacist  to come into the immunization room for assistance and bring an ice pack. She ran into the room to help. At this time 1:08pm the patient began to shake and had what appeared to be a seizure. I dialed 911 and pharmacist was helping patient and protected his head. After shaking for about 10 seconds, the patient stopped. He then awoke, jumped awake confused and scared. We sat patient down and monitored him. At this time the pharmacy tech called management. After patient was calm and sitting, we called his wife into the room. Management arrived in pharmacy. At 1:12pm patient felt cold and clammy.  He said he very much had to use the restroom. With assistance, he used the pharmacy bathroom. EMT arrived at 1:16pm. EMT determined low blood pressure. Patient had worked outside all morning in heat and was likely under hydrated. Over the next few minutes, EMT determined the patient&#39;s blood pressure was increasing. At 1:22pm, patient declined to go to the hospital. EMT signed off and left. Patient remained in room until about 1:40 with his wife to rest. Management got him candy and a fan to help. His wife and management then took him to their car.

Client&#39;s vital signs taken at 1553 and were BP 148/90, P 99, O2 97% and R 16. Client was given some water and animal crackers. Client was encouraged to drink fluids and stay hydrated. Client continued to report having nausea, dizziness, and a headache. Blood pressure was reassessed at 1610 and was 178/100. PHN questioned if client had high blood pressure and client reported, &#34;It runs in my family.&#34; PHN educated client that his BP was quite elevated, and PHN explained that a diastolic BP of 100 usually occurs over time. PHN advised client to go to walk in if his symptoms do not improve, but PHN strongly recommended client follow up with his primary care provider in regards to his elevated blood pressure. Client told PHN that he would most likely go to the walk in. Client verbalized understanding. Client left clinic with his wife who was giving him a ride. On 6/18/2021 at 1014 PHN placed call to client to see how client was feeling today. Call went straight to voicemail. PHN requested call back.

THE VACCINE WAS GIVEN WITHOUT INCIDENT AND PATIENT SAID HE FELT OK. HE TRADED PLACES WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AND SAT IN A CHAIR IN THE EXAM ROOM. IT WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER I HAD ALREADY GIVEN HIS GIRLFRIEND HER VACCINE THAT HE SAID THAT HE WAS FEELING FUNNY. HIS COLORING CHANGED AND HE WAS DIAPHORETIC. I GOT A PAPERTOWEL WITH COOL WATER ON IT AND PLACED ON HIS NECK AND ANOTHER ONE FOR HIS FOREHEAD. AFTER A MINUTE OR SO, HE DID PASS OUT WHILE IN THE CHAIR. HE WAS OUT FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS AND THEN CAME BACK TO AND WAS ALERT AND ORIENTED X 4 BUT STILL FELT VERY WEAK. I GAVE HIM A WATER TO SIP ON. HIS GIRLFRIEND STAYED AT HIS SIDE THE WHOLE TIME. HIS O2 WAS 100% AND HIS PULSE 53. HE SAID THAT HE HAD EATEN SHORTLY BEFORE COMING TO GET HIS VACCINE BUT THEN LATER ASKED FOR AN APPLE BECAUSE HE WAS ON A CLEANSE DIET AND REALLY HAD NOT EATTEN MUCH. THE PCT WENT TO GET HIM AN APPLE. AFTER EATING THE APPLE AND SITTING FOR AN ADDITIONAL 20 MIN HE FELT WELL ENOUGH TO LEAVE. STILL WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND AND HIS GIRLFRIEND COMMITTED TO DRIVING HIM SO HE DID NOT HAVE TO. HE LEFT WITH NO ASSISTANCE.

                                                The night of 3/23/21 at 5pm I had chills in my Brady and numbness and tingling in my toes. I looked at my toes and noticed they were turning very pale.  One minute later the bottoms of my feet started turning yellow and within one more minute the bottoms of my feet souls were completely yellow. I have never had this reaction before. It was shocking and looked like I had stepped in yellow paint.

                                                Pt had history of anaphylaxis related to bee stings. We asked if he had ever had a reaction to another vaccine and he said no. Pt came up saying he wasn&#39;t feeling well during the observation period, within about 5-10 minutes after receiving the vaccination. He look very pale and clammy. I asked if he was ok and he shook his head. Tried to grab a chair for him and he started to collapse. With some help I was able to get him to the ground without injury. We called 911 and I grabbed an epipen. I tried to assess the patient, and he was unable to tell me if he was having any trouble breathing or if his lips/mouth/tongue was swelling. He was conscious but couldn&#39;t speak coherently. I administered the epipen to his right lateral thigh due to his history of anaphylaxis with bee stings. We were able to lay him down while waiting for the ambulance. His color started to return and he was able to respond to questions, but was still slightly confused. He did tell me at this point that he has had similar reactions after vaccines and blood work. The paramedics arrived and took the patients vitals and took him to the hospital.

                                                Within a few minutes of receiving the vaccination I lost consciousness. It was a drive-through vaccination clinic by the Health department. My vehicle rolled into a cement and metal bar/side of the building&#39;s exit at a slow speed. The EMS at the scene stated that my heartbeat was irregular, varying between bradycardia and tachycardia. When they checked my blood pressure inside the ambulance they stated it was very low. About 15-20 minutes later I tried to sit up and was still unstable and unable to keep myself upright without assistance. I was then taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital&#39;s emergency department. Nothing notable or unusual was found when I was checked out there. Within a couple hours I felt well enough to go home. Once home I had a headache, fatigue, mild dizziness, and nausea with physical activity. The following day I had a headache, muscle aches, pain at the injection site, and nausea with extended physical activity. Today I have pain in the arm where I received the vaccine and a mild headache.

At around 2am April 11 I went to use the bathroom and blacked out. My wife found me on the floor and was able to rouse me. Went to the ER with severe stomach pain, nausea, diarrhea, severe headache, fever, high pulse of 120-140bpm. Pulse dropped to 108bpm by the time i got to te hospital. Hospital administered Zofran for my gastro issues and ran an EKG. We waited 3&#43; hours and never saw a doctor and was never even taken back in the ER. We left due to staff and patients in the waiting room not wearing respirators or masks or even basic sanitary precautions or separation of patients with Covid symptoms from other patients.

                                                Monday, April 12th, around 2pm I started to develop extreme stomach pain, as well as noticed some shortness of breath or elevated heart rate. The stomach pain worsened after dinner. I  assumed it was something I ate, which was the same thing I eat every day, and expected it was some type of gas that would resolve itself naturally. I went to bed in lots of pain. I didn&#39;t sleep well due to the issues and woke up still in pain in my mid stomach, mostly on the left side. I called the nurse who did an intake and advised that I go to the ER (Tuesday, April 13th)

We had him sit, helped him calm his breathing; I assessed for wheezing and swelling of the tongue, but he did not have those symptoms.  The patient was able to speak and did not report dizziness or lose consciousness.  Paramedics responded.  I spoke with the patient this morning, and he reports no residual symptoms.

                                                Patient was in observation waiting his 15 minutes when he stated he started felling dizzy. He then went into a syncopal episode and started having seizure like movements. The nurses onsite assisted the patient to the floor to prevent any injuries. After about 5 minutes the patient came to. As EMT was being called the nurse assessed the patient blood pressure and other vitals which read as the flowing BP 176/86 , RR 19 , HR 83. The EMT team arrived on site around 2:15 and assessed the patient. The EMT&#39;s did a 12 lead  on the patient and noticed some elevation in his heart rhythm and told the patient that he recommends  he go to the hospital the patient refused and went home instead.
