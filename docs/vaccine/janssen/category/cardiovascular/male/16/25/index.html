Four to five healthcare workers attended to him, asking him to &#34;stay with us.&#34; They called an ambulance, and the medics monitored him for awhile. Heart rate dropped to 34 bpm, clothing drenched with perspiration. Blood sugar was slightly low, although he had eaten a late brunch of two fried eggs, sourdough toast and fruit salad. The last thing he remembers is a cold sensation shooting down his arm and into his left hand. He tried to talk to say he wasn&#39;t feeling well, but he couldn&#39;t form the words, so he raised his arm and then fainted. He felt generally unwell the rest of the day, and today he is still not fully recovered.

                                                We gave patient the vaccine and advised him to wait for the CDC recommended 15 minutes observation time. He decided to leave after just a few minutes, despite his dad (who was with him) questioning the decision and suggesting he stay 15 minutes. I was then told by a member of management through our walkie-talkie system that they needed me at the front register immediately because someone passed out after getting a vaccine. I was there within the minute with my vaccine emergency bag. Upon arriving, the patient was already awake, talking, and sitting in a chair. He also was profusely sweating. He stated he&#39;s never experienced anything like this before. He said he normally has low blood pressure. He starting drinking some water. When I checked his blood pressure it was so low the machine gave an error message. Throughout this time, the patient progressively was feeling better and eventually wound up laughing and smiling. Him and his father said that he would be ok and that he was feeling himself. I told him to sit for a bit more before leaving and stay as long as he wants. I called him later that evening to check on him and had to leave a voicemail. His father called back 2 days later and said he&#39;s been fine.

                                                After a few hours, developed a low grade headache and some soreness at the injection site.  About two hours later I started getting extremely cold, despite the temperature in the mid-high 70s. I covered up under blankets. I began feeling very tired and a general sick feeling. After about an hour and a half of progressively worse chills and cold sweat, I began to get very very hot and removed all blankets and eventually clothes. I took my temperature, which was at 102 f. At this point I drank some water and Gatorade and waited for it to pass. I also noticed that my Apple Watch heart rate detection was saying my heart rate was in the high 90s to low 100s despite me just laying in bed. This was alarming because my typical resting heart rate is in the low 60s. About two hours later I felt well enough to at least brush my teeth, but upon standing up was greeted with an extreme feeling of weakness and dizziness and it was hard to keep myself up right. I eventually was able to fall asleep, and upon waking up, felt better, but still not great. My heart rate was more normal at this point, I no longer had chills or a fever, but still had a headache and soreness across my body, worst at the injection site.

Patient had history of passing out during vaccination and blood draws. Patient felt sweaty and turned white. His color returned after a minute, I talked to his mother who was there during the incident. Did not eat or drink the morning of vaccine. I checked his pulse and blood pressure and it was 129/72 and pulse of 78. We gave him some water and orange juice. He felt much better. Then his mom bought him some muffins. He sat and ate for about 30 minutes and left feeling back to normal.

                                                I woke up around 1 am so sick that I could not sleep. My head was throbbing with every single heart beat. I had a fever of 102 and was constantly switching between chills and sweating through my sheets. The room felt like it was spinning and I felt like I was going to puke. Lastly I started to get chest pain which was by far the most concerning part to me. I still have a headache and chills but the fever is gone, and I am recovering

Heart rate (normally 60) spiked to 140 and could not see fit five seconds, had to call ambulance. Ambulance determined much of it was due to anxiety (multiple exams and significant work were due soon), and recommended medical supervision to ensure it did not escalate. Went to urgent care and was supervised until 1 pm, 24 hours after the vaccination, by which time symptoms had subsided

                                                Immediately had a dull headache. About an hour and a half just didn&#39;t feel well and became very tired where he was dozing off.  About 7:00 pm started to shake.  This continued to get worse with severe jerking along with the uncontrollable shaking.  Had a rapid resting heart rate over 142 and a fever at 102.4.  Was incoherent, mumbling his words and not making any sense. Went to ER at 8:48 pm they did blood work, urine test and started an IV.  They weren&#39;t sure what was going on and first accused of doing drugs then wanted to do a spinal tap. His father stopped that and again told them it was from the covid vaccine. They finally gave him a shot of Ketorolac 30mg and LORazepan 1 mg. They sent him home and told him to take tylenol for his fever. spontaneous shaking kept on until late 3/11, along with a fever.  Friday 3/12 he is feeling better, fever has broke but not quite 100%.

The next day, I developed a fever of 100.2 and was really cold. For about a week, I would be fine during the day and would get really tired by the evening and extremely cold. I also started feeling tightness in my chest about 2 days after I got the vaccine. I contacted my doctor and she told me to take Tylenol and Albuterol.

As I was running to him pt started slipping out of his chair, as a women, who I later found out was his mother and I helped keep pt in chair as he fainted and then seized for about 2 seconds and then gained consciousness. Upon awakening pt said , what  just happened?&#34; The mother answered &#34;oh you just had a little seizure, you&#39;re fine.&#34; To my surprise, I asked the mother is this has happened before and she said yes when he sees needles/get shots.  I told them the ambulance was on it&#39;s why and the mother asked &#34;why?!&#34; I told her because your son just fainted/had a seizure and we want to make sure he is ok.  The pt refused to go to the hospital.  I did go back out there and mentioned to them that it is very important to answer questions truthfully any time they are asked as they failed to honestly answer our questions about ever feeling faint after receiving a vaccine. His blood pressure normalized and once the paramedics left so did they.

                                                Patient was administered Janssen COVID vaccine. Patient was fine immediately post administration in the IMZ room but witness stated he fell sideways (within a few minutes of receiving the vaccine) out of post-administration observation chair (which is in front of the pharmacy). Technician called code white and patient was immediately met with management and the pharmacy team. Patient was laying on his stomach on the floor, supporting himself upward with both hands/forearms. Patient had blood dripping from forehead and nose. Gauze was applied to laceration on forehead to help with bleeding and once patient was able to roll over on his back, an ice pack was applied to his forehead/nose area. Patient said he felt &#34;pain&#34; after the injection and then he felt light-headed. He remembered blacking out for a few seconds. Patient stated he felt &#34;ok&#34;, then later stated he felt better but just had a bad headache. Patient stated he felt &#34;it starting to hurt&#34; and that it triggered his anxiety. Dad was in the store and arrived a few minutes later; dad said son/patient has a &#34;fear of needles&#34; and &#34;he hasn&#39;t had anything to eat today in quite awhile&#34;. EMS arrived to examine patient and asked him if he needed to go to the ER; dad felt going to the ER was for the best since they had a 3 hour car ride home. Paramedics then transported patient to the ER and said he would likely need a stitch for the cut above his eyebrow.

                                                Patient was waiting in chair about 5 minutes after the vaccine when I heard him say he didn&#39;t feel too good. His skin color was pale and when I went up to see how he was he bent over and vomited. After he vomited he said he felt a lot better. I asked him to remain seated and asked for my tech in the pharmacy to call 911, but he then said no and that he was feeling better. He said he felt clammy just before he vomited. I asked him to stay seated and got him some cold water. He remained in the waiting area another 15 minutes after to make sure no further problems. After 15 minutes he was feeling fine and I reassessed and his color returned to his skin and I noticed some redness around inner portion of both thighs, but he said that was from his eczema and that it was there already.  Allowed him to leave at 1:15pm and told him to seek medical attention right away if he felt any issues regarding trouble breathing. I called him an hour later to check up on him at 1:30pm and he was feeling fine. He thanked me over the phone.

No amount of layers seemed to help.  Approximately 30min later I began to have a fever and a rapid heart beat started which led to chest pains . The chest pains subsided throughout the night, but the fever and chills lasted to around 11:00 AM, April 11th. I also had a bad headache from approximately  7AM to 10AM. Theses symptoms stopped around 11:00AM April 11th. Around 12 hours later I started experiencing chills and a fever again, however, these symptoms were less severe than the night before and subsided throughout the night.

                                                Patient was given vaccine and was told to wait in the monitoring area for 15 minutes post vaccination. Shortly after, the patient reported &#34;feeling pale&#34; and was told to remain seated. The patient then fell over from the chair and lost consciousness. We immediately called 911 and went to the patient&#39;s side with epinephrine. However, he recovered within seconds and was able to sit up and drink water.  He reported feeling &#34;pale [...], weird [...]&#34; and said he felt like his &#34;ears are sweating.&#34; He did not want epinephine and remained seated and responsive. When asked, he said he had never received any adverse reactions to any vaccines in the past. A pharmacist then cleaned and disinfected his right temple that was bleeding, which he seemed to have hit when he fell. He later reported feeling chest pain and slight difficulty breathing but did not want epinephrine at that time. Emergency services arrived about 20 minutes after and assessed the patient and removed him in a gurney.

                                                1. Vasovagal syncope almost immediately after vaccination, little to no warning of oncoming syncope 2. Extremely fast acting fever (temperature went from 98.6 to 100.5 in roughly 30 minutes) followed by nausea, pounding headache, and body aches/chills. Remedied by alternating very high doses of ibuprofen (800mg) and acetaminophen (1000mg or 1g) every two to three hours. This did not ever bring down the fever below 100 degrees. 3. Blurred vision around 29 hours after vaccine - advised to go to ER by triage nurse. ER doctor determined not to worry about, likely due to headache but not 100% sure.

He said his vision turned black, felt dizzy. His breathing was normal, but blood pressure dropped. During the 2 min observation time, his breathing was fast at some point. He said he wasn&#39;t nauseous. He asked for water. I gave him some warm water. He finished the whole cup of 6 oz of water.  We continued to monitor his blood pressure every 2-3 min. His blood pressure was going up every time we checked. He continued to ask for water, and he drank another cup of warm water. After about 10 min, he felt better and able to walk without dizziness.

He then had chills, fever of 101.2.  His pulse stayed at 95-100 beats per minute for 2 hours.  I spoke to a nurse friend of mine who told me to give him Tylenol and Benadryl.  His pulse went down to 80 beats per minute.  His fever went higher during the night but eventually broke.  Next morning he was still running a low grade fever and took Tylenol the rest of day.  He also had diarrhea on 2nd day and exhaustion.  3rd day feeling better but still tired.  No fever or diarrhea today.

He said it felt good to lay on the ground, so I him lay for 5 minutes, then I helped him to a chair. I told him I wanted him to stay seated for 30 minutes so I can monitor him. He called his father, who came to pick him up after the 30 minutes were up.  He slowly stood up and walked a few steps and then left the store with his father.

He was accompanied with his mother, who stated that she was there for support. It was not made clear to the vaccinator that the patient had a history of fainting with vaccines or blood draws. The vaccine was administered, and the patient immediately lost consciousness. The patient was placed in a chair with arms, and was caught before falling to the ground. The patient did not come in contact with the floor or any surfaces to cause further damage. The patient with quickly assessed by the pharmacist on duty and 911 was called by the other pharmacist. The patient quickly regained consciousness and was aware that he had &#34;done it again&#34;. Neither the patient nor the mother were particularly concerned about the event, but we called the paramedics to be safe. The paramedics came and took vitals, everything checked out okay and the patient declined transport to the hospital. The patient&#39;s mother then drove the patient home.

Patient received vaccine and then became lightheaded, so the RN called for a medical response. NP and RN responded and found patient lethargic but answering questions appropriately, sitting in a chair. Patient was able to tell me his name, DOB, and what he had for lunch. Patient was moved over to nearby cot and while there experienced a 15 second syncopal event while supine. Patient was hypotensive and diaphoretic. Patient became responsive after 15 seconds and was able to tell us his name. Patient was able to sit up and drink juice, have a granola bar, and inform us that he has experienced this reaction to a flu vaccine and while having blood drawn. Medical team was called to evaluate the patient. The patient refused transport and signed out.

I had already instructed him to sit on the floor if he started feeling faint  as he stated previous fainting episodes as a kid. He sat on the floor, then laid on the floor. I brought him a garbage can in case he got sick, an ice pack, wet paper towels, and a bottle of water. After 5 minutes or so the color came back to his face and he started feeling much better. He then sat back in the chair, then stood up and stated he was feeling back to normal. I asked him to stay standing an extra minute just to make sure he was good, then he left with the woman who was with him during the vaccine.

Pt did not lose consciousness but blacked out (visual disturbances, tinnitus/temporary hearing loss, nausea) occurred within 2-3 minutes of administration. First attempt to read BP was low (~80/60). Pt is an athlete, so I waited until after water was consumed to take BP again. 2nd reading was ~106/65. Pt felt better after drinking water and after sitting for 15 minutes under observation.

Then the inside of my chest started getting really hot and my vision started going white in both of my eyes, it took about 10 seconds for me to completely lose vision. Then I passed out, I have no idea how long I was out for but when I came too I had a sort of epileptic-type seizure but I do not know how long it lasted. I woke up completely disoriented, had no idea where I was at and had a severe cognitive dysfunction. I still have moments where I just can&#39;t follow or complete a thought or just kind of go blank.

I asked him to sit down and started walking around the counter to check on him and check his blood pressure. At that moment he fainted and lost consciousness. Another patient caught his head and he did not hit his head. He remained unconscious for 30 seconds and we were preparing to start CPR breaths as he had a pulse but was not breathing.  His eyelids were fluttering.  He regained consciousness at that time and we waited with him until EMS arrived. His blood sugar was very low when EMS arrived.

We called EMS and code white at that time.  Patient was unresponsive for a few seconds but woke up quickly.  When we asked about any reactions to previous vaccine patient stated he had no reactions.  After talking to him once he was feeling better, he did mention that this has happened in the past when his blood sugar was low.  We gave cool compress and patient refused services from EMS.  We also offered water and store management offered orange juice.  We also advised him to stay for an additional 30 minutes for observation.

                                                At around 7PM the day of the J&amp;J vaccine, I began to feel very fatigued and could tell that I was going to come down with a fever. I went to bed early that day around 10PM. Woke up around 1:30AM on the 4th. Felt terrible and took my temperature. It read 101.5. Got up to use restroom and when washing hands, everything started to go blurry, I thought i had just become lightheaded and that it would pass so i stood there leaning against the bathroom door.I  ended up fainting and hitting my head on the cabinets. I was completely soaked in sweat.  An hour later we drove to the ER to make sure everything as okay. IV was started, some test performed, and fever was gone by 5AM. Felt completely fine after going home and resting for a few hours.

I was walking across my room and passed out waking up on the floor. Muscle cramps and tightness followed this.  I could not move my muscles for roughly 12 hours. After 24 hours from receiving vaccine these extreme symptoms seemed to fade and I was left with fatigue, soreness and fever as expected. This lasted for the next 3 days

                                                Around 6:15 PM the day of the vaccine, began to experience chills and a headache. I also became very dehydrated quickly and started to rest. I woke up around 8:30PM the same day with a fever of 102.7F, but no longer had chills. The headache had gotten worse and I took Ibuprofen to help the fever and headache. I feel back asleep until 11:30PM the same day when I was feeling better and had come down from my fever. I slept the rest of the night and woke up feeling dehydrated still and tired. When looking at my Apple Watch, my heart rate jumped to 90-120 BPM when the symptoms started and stayed around there until when I woke up the next day. The symptoms ran their course and I did not have any other events until April 13th, 3 days after the vaccine when I developed a dry cough.

                                                I took a nap after around an hour of receiving my shot at around 1:40pm. Once I awoke at around 6pm, I had irritated eyes, extreme nausea, extreme dizziness, insatiably low body temperature, extreme shivers, migraine because of my head uncontrollably shaking, and dry mouth. I felt like I was in 20 degree weather and nothing I could do would heat my body up. My body grew so tired from the uncontrollable shaking that I could not get out of bed to get my phone to call 911. Every symptom I was experiencing was not mild and was to the level of extreme. This lasted until around 9am. I have been slowly recovering since then (currently almost 9pm) and feel only 70% back to normal.

When safe, he was assisted to WC and taken to clinic where he was observed for a few hours. Patient discharged home with his mother when he was feeling better.

The pharmacist addressed his concerns and proceeded with the immunization. While the patient was in the waiting  area and decided to get up and walked over to report he was not feeling well and proceeded to faint.  911 was called and the patient refused treatment

He lost consciousness twice but only for a few seconds and then he &#34;came to.&#34; I helped along with the mother to lay him down to prevent injury. Patient was alert, breathing, and responding, but still appeared pale, &#34;clamy&#34; shaky and sweaty.  Code was followed with store management responding, ambulance arrived to take care of patient within minutes.

                                                Patient was visibly nervous prior to receiving the vaccine. About 5 minutes after administration (during the 15 minute watch period), patient appeared to be slumped over in the chair. He had eyes closed and seemed to be shaking slightly. Pharmacist and tech grabbed the emergency kit and laid patient on the floor. After a few more seconds the patient woke up and was able to respond to questions. He was very pale, sweaty, reported feeling clammy and dizzy. Patient claimed he had not eaten since the morning. We gave him some water and a pb&amp;j sandwich. Patient stated he felt better and he just gets very nervous around needles. The patient sat with us for another 30 minutes until his grandmother and cousin were able to come pick him up from the pharmacy.

No history of fainting or seizure. EMS was called and arrived within about 10 minutes, and patient appeared to experience another seizure and he vomited. EMS then transported the patient to the hospital.

                                                Patient was administered the Janssen COVID vaccine at 403 pm. I returned back to the pharmacy to prep his partner&#39;s vaccine and when I came back at 405 pm, he was loopy with his head swaying. He wasn&#39;t responding to verbal communication by his spouse and me nor through touch as I shook his shoulder. He then lost consciousness and so I lifted his head to check for breathing and pulse which he had. I asked my technician to call 911, and asked my other tech to help me transition him to the floor so we can raise his legs to provide blood flow to his head. Mid-transition, he had a seizure. We brought him completely to the floor and just as I was about to turn him to his side, he regained consciousness. Pupils were dilated, breathing normal, pulse elevated. He also was able to speak immediately and confirmed feeling &#34;okay&#34;. I then had my technician remain outside with him laying on the ground as I returned back inside the pharmacy to call management and my technician was still on the phone with EMS. Paramedics and management arrived within 10 minutes upon which patient was then taken to the hospital. Wife followed and we rescheduled her vaccine.

He had his eyes open but was unconscious for about 1 minute. Then he released his bladder and peed on himself. The pharmacist noticed and came over then he responded and was consious again. Then he began to sweat excessively all over his body. His face turned pale and the pharmacist began taking his blood pressure which dropped very low. He then began to feel nauseated. Then he started to get body chills. We monitored my husband there for another 30min and he slowly was coming back to his normal self. He had a small headache but was fine enough to leave.

We had him lay flat on the floor and continued to monitor and have conversations with him. His vitals were confirmed to be normal by the EMS and patient declined to be transported to the hospital. He remained in the premises for about an hour for observation after which he had a friend drive him home.

Nausea lasted approximately 30 minutes, trembling lasted about 45 minutes.  Important to note that I previously had COVID-19 60-70 days prior to vaccination. The symptoms from the vaccine were significantly worse; however, they appear to have lasted for a much shorter period.

Leading up to the hear rate increasing I was fine and just enjoying my day. No drugs or alcohol or did not do any exercise that day. Felt uncomfortable and with some anxiety I visited a urgent care facility. The visit was about 45 minutes and left. As I am writing this, my heart rate is still a bit above normal but doing better.

                                                Patient admitted to being nervous prior to administration and said he did not like needles.  Patient was consulted about what to expect, side effects, and asked if he had any additional questions prior to receiving vaccination.  Patient declined and said he wanted to have the vaccine administered.  Patient sat down in the designated waiting area.  Approximately 2-5 minutes later patient blacked out and his body weight caused the chair he was sitting in to flip over, thus landing on the floor.  EMS was called.  Patient came to about 30-60 seconds later.  Patient was disoriented, sweaty, pale, and shaky.  Blood pressure was taken with a result of 143/95.  EMS arrived and evaluated the patient.  Patient admitted to having nothing to eat or drink today and being very anxious previous to getting the vaccine.  There were no signs of an allergic reaction.  Patient&#39;s blood pressure was checked about 20 minutes later and was returning towards normal.  Patient declined transport to the hospital, but mother was called to come pick him up.  Patient was advised to get something to eat soon and to rest and be observed for the next 24 hours.

                                                The patient after receiving his vaccine, was recommended to take a seat for 15 minutes to observe for any adverse reactions. Very shortly after the shot, he walked up to the counsel window to ask for a bottled water because he was starting to feel faint. As I was trying to suggest he immediately take a seat, he fainted and fell forward into the immunization booth which absorbed most of his fall as he went to the ground and landed almost sitting cross legged. Immediately myself and pharmacy staff laid him flat onto his back and raised his legs above his head where he regained consciousness immediately and stayed laying down for a period of time to make sure he was feeling okay. After a few minutes we gave him a bottled water and had him sit down for 15 more minutes where he claimed he was feeling much better.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At 11 PM the night of the vaccine (Saturday), extremely bad chills, fever and weakness set in almost immediately. I could not get my body to warm up and was borderline too weak to walk. Very bad headache and nausea set in as well.  After several hours the chills turned to intermittent sweating/cold and I could not keep a consistent body temp, nor sleep that night. The next morning  (Sunday) I had very bad aches and soreness, along with chills/fever and headaches that could be managed fine with around the clock acetaminophen. Around 8 PM that night, most of these flu like symptoms subsided. The following morning (Monday), still very exhausted despite a full 10 hours sleep. Tiredness and weakness lasted through the day. Tuesday morning until around 3 PM i still experienced drowsiness and was unable to gain strength for anything more than typical day to day tasks (could not workout). Wednesday morning, felt normal but while exercising experienced shortness of breath almost immediately as well as chest/lung pain easily. Come Thursday I feel 90% normal.

                                                At roughly 4pm the day of vaccine I started to feel generally sore in my muscles. At around 7pm I started to become light headed, had a headache, and bad muscle pain. My fever at this point measured 102f. These negative effects increased over the next few hours until I fell on the floor and couldn&#39;t get up without help from my wife. I felt like I was going to pass out every five seconds, threw up twice, my muscles kept contracting and relaxing and were intensely painful. Around 12:30am Saturday morning we went to the emergency department. I needed a wheelchair to get around. The wait at emergency was too long, and by 3am we went back home. I was feeling slightly better, but still not great, and my fever had reduced. I rested on Saturday with less severe but still considerable symptoms, and took paracetamol. Now on Sunday I feel sick and a little sore and very tired, but mostly better.

                                                Began feeling delirious around 7:00pm - uneasy and strange. Upon walking to the subway station, I felt overwhelmed with sudden depressive thoughts and anxiety.   On the Subway, I had a very severe, and disturbing panic attack. My vision became blurred and distorted, my heart rate spiked, and I became nauseous and extremely frightened. I sat down to try to maintain a sense of calm - but got off the subway after a few stops and met with a friend whom I had texted, to take care of me. From the point on, I was very shaken and agitated, and have been since the event.    I have never experienced anxiety, depression, or any such symptoms in my life before, nor was I nervous or anxious about having received the vaccine. The onset of the event was sudden, and seemingly out of nowhere, without real purpose, hence my conviction that it may have been spurred as a side effect from the vaccination.  I went to Urgent Care Sunday morning, April 11th, the morning after the event. My resting pulse was 97 BPM (normally 52-54) - and my blood pressure much higher than normal - 175/110. The doctor insisted I go home &#34;and relax&#34;.    I still feel uneasy and shaken from the event.

                                                Patient received the vaccine and was asked to wait in the observation area afterwards.  He approached the counter a few minutes later to report he wasn&#39;t feeling well.  As he was speaking with the technician he became very pale, reported lightheadedness and fainted with loss of consciousness.  The technician reported that he witnessed convulsive type tonic movements concentrated in the neck and upper-arms more than the abdomen or legs.  He also reported foaming at the mouth and following each event which repeated 3 times in less then 15 minutes,  he woke with confusion and no memory of where he was.  EMS arrived after 15 minutes and transported the patient to the ED for evaluation.    Upon follow up with the patient the next day, he reported that the ED found nothing on his medical exam and he had worked a 10 hour shift prior to receiving the vaccine and had had nothing to eat or drink.

He did say that he had not eaten and it was 3:00pm. paramedics soon arrived and removed the patient from the scene.  I did text patient the next day and he said only that he had a sore arm and symptoms consistent with having a vaccine administered.

He was conscious by the time I got to the other side of the counter but was stating he felt very nauseated like he was going to vomit. We got the patient to a sitting position and got him some cold water. Patient remained seated on the floor until his mother arrived and escorted him out about 15 minutes later.

It is extremely painful as it happens, but since it lasts so briefly each time it&#39;s bearable, if it were to happen for longer than it would actually be unbearable.

Pt. came to profusely sweating, pale, and feeling dizzy.  We took his BP and kept monitoring it for 45 minutes after we had him lay down.  His BP continued to rise and was normal.  Pt. was nervous before vaccine administration (shaking).  After event, Pt. stated this has happened in the past with donating blood.  Pt.&#39;s girlfriend picked him up, so he did not drive home.

About 5 hours after that I got chills that made me shake all over because I got a fever of 103. Then 2 hours later my heart started to beat very rapidly and got up to 126 beats per minute, my heart was also not only beating vast but very very hard. Then throughout the night and all of the next day, I had pain in my chest on the left side and also pain in my rib area on the left side. The pain lasted for over 24 hours and because of that I went to the emergency room. It turned out they didn&#39;t find anything life threatening at the emergency room but all the pain I had was very scary and very uncomfortable. It was a terrible experience and because of it, I am telling people not to get the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.

I initially felt really warm in my arm and my heart started to race for a bit. That subsided pretty quickly. Then I got really dizzy, lightheaded and warm and sweaty while waiting the 15 minutes. Then my vision started to blur and I felt tingly in both of my hands and both of my legs. According to others with me, I also went grey. I was given a cool cloth and fanned which helped with a lot of the issues. I also had my legs elevated and was given some slightly sugary food and drink to help the vaccine disperse better. Paramadics and amabulance arrived to assess me. I was improving by the time they arrived and was deemed stable, so I did not go to the hospital for this incident

                                                One week after receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, several small bruises (6-8) appeared on the back of my left leg. Throughout the day, my leg developed a soreness that, after reading a 10 Feb 2021 story in the newspaper about COVID vaccine recipients developing immune thrombocytopenia caused me to seek medical treatment in the afternoon of 4/6/2020. I first visited an urgent care facility where my high blood pressure (130/98) combined with my slight lightheadedness, soreness in the leg and observes bruising were enough for the tending physician to recommend rushing to the ER for bloodwork to be performed immediately. I was admitted to the ER in the early evening with an elevated blood pressure (~150/111) and the bruising still prevalent. The tending nurse practitioner authorized a complete blood count (CBC) and discharged me an hour later when the results came back ?extremely close to normal,? noting that my platelet count of 194 was no immediate cause for concern. Since then, the bruising and soreness has subsided.

                                                Patient received immunization. Was sitting in chair for observation and about 5 minutes after immunization was given he passed out. Was awake  immediately but said he didn&#39;t remember passing out. Knew his name, date of birth, where he was. I watched him until paramedics arrived. He said he felt fine but was sweaty.  Paramedics  stated all his vitals were normal and he said he felt ok but he said he got really hot.  Remained at the pharmacy until his friend could come and get him.
