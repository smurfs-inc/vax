He tested his blood sugar which was okay, and he asked his wife to take him to the fire department.  They said his heart was beating out of his chest.  They took him to Hospital and told him that he had atrial fibrillation.  They kept him in the hospital for 2 days and gave him medications and now he&#39;s feeling much better.   They gave him Coumadin for this.

                                                Patient states on Friday, 4/9, he went to the pharmacy to receive his J&amp;J Covid-19 vaccine. He states on Saturday morning, his R nostril began to bleed, and continued to bleed until Monday. He states on Wednesday, 4/7, he noticed oral sores that at first were not painful, but large. He was worried about it interfering with his shot, but because he had waited so long to get it, he decided to proceed anyway. He denies any fever or chills, no frank diarrhea, but occasional loose stools, without blood seen. He denies HA, vision changes, or focal neuro deficits. On Sunday, 4/11, the patient ended up going to ED to evaluate his epistaxis, the MD attributed it to his elevated BP, the patient reports it being 160s/90s. They gave him new BP medications, which he took, but when he saw the Dr., he instructed the patient not to keep taking his BP meds. When asking the patient if anything correlates with foods he eats, the only thing he can pinpoint it to, would be pico de gallo. He states it has irritated his mouth before. He also reports recently taking his wife&#39;s supplement (unknown name) but thinks it is for cholesterol. He took that approximately 1 week ago. No new changes in food habits, mouthwash, or toothpaste. He states once his sores began to get a little painful, he went to buy a special mouthwash for oral sores (unsure name). His only reported allergy is to Lisinopril, which his reaction was a whole body rash.    He states they did not pack his nose or do anything for his epistaxis at the ER, but eventually he let the nostril clot with blood. Now he feels fullness in the nare, but does not want to disturb the clot in fear that it will re-bleed. His wife also noticed a petechial rash that began on his BLE, he is unsure when that started.    He presented to  ED on 4/13, due to his PCP  instructing him to be evaluated when he had outpatient labs done and revealed a PLT count of 4,000. In the ED, the patient had normal vital signs.  He was transfused one unit of PLTs. He also had a negative head CT. He was also started on decadron 40mg PO daily by heme/onc. Patient tells me today his sores are less painful and feel smaller than usual. Heme/onc also ordered 2 IVIG 1,000 mg/kg/day x2 doses.

It got to the point within 2 weeks that he was not able to get up from the chair due to the shortness of breath.  By 4/1/21 he was not able to breath very well, but continued to stay home.  Then by 4/12/21 he was not able to breath well at all and his wife took him to the ER.  In the hospital they did x-rays and found out that his lungs are full of blood clots and both legs have blood clots in them.  He was admitted and gave him Heparin drip for the 2 days to get the blood clots dissolved and was also on oxygen for 2 days.  He was discharged home yesterday with Xarelto, and was told that he would be on that for the rest of his life, and is on oxygen for sleep and when he&#39;s up and around, but if he&#39;s resting and feels he&#39;s breathing okay he can remove it.   They informed him that it would take approximately 2 months for all the blood clots to dissipate, and that he was full of blood clots, and had both legs and both lungs which are quite full.

Positive for extensive acute bilateral pulmonary emboli at the lung bases as  detailed in the body of the report.  DX Chest Portable 1 View  Final Result  Mild left ventricular prominence is noted. Small right pleural  effusion is seen. Minimal discoid atelectatic changes in the left perihilar  region and left lung base. Elevated right hemidiaphragm suggests eventration.   Admitted to Hospital 4/5/21, per admission diagnosis: Acute pulmonary embolism (*) submassive likely secondary to covid 19  Per hospital course notes:Patient presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was show to have submassive PE with severe pulmonary hypertension seen on TTE. He should be on lifelong therapy given 2nd VTE and severity.  Iwould consider unprovoked (COVID in 11/20 wouldn&#39;t count I wouldn&#39;t think).  He was started on eliquis 10 mg BID x 7 days than 5 mg bid. Given his severe pulm htn on TTE, left atrial pressure normal.  We would have outpatient sleep study as well He will need VQ scan to assure no CTEPH. Will have outpatient follow up. We discontinued his aspirin on discharge as well.

They found none of the usual suspects that cause this spike. Vaccination was my only new experience in many months. Never had near this high of a reading. Is there a connection?

I drove him to the ER for evaluation where a CT scan revealed the brain bleed.  He was subsequently transported to the emergency unit that evening.  He was disoriented and suffered a concussion as well.  He had daily blood work and was treated with Levetiracetam for 5 days post discharge on 4/22.

                                                Per Regulatory Authority it is to be reported if patient gets COVID if fully vaccinated.  Per MD note 1.  Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure:  This is in a patient with COVID pneumonia.  The patient was placed on supplemental oxygen.  The plan is for the patient to use supplemental oxygen with oxygen by nasal cannula up to 6 L and if oxygen saturation falls below 90% on 6 L oxygen by nasal cannula, he will be transitioned to high-flow oxygen.  However, if he is on maximal support with high-flow oxygen with oxygen saturation falling below 90%, the patient should be placed on BiPAP and transferred to the ICU.  The patient is a full code. 2.  COVID pneumonia:  This in a patient who apparently received his Johnson and Johnson COVID vaccine 3 weeks ago.  The patient started on treatment with remdesivir.  He will get steroids.  He is prescribed Tessalon Perles and Robitussin with codeine as needed for coughing.  He may be considered for potentially other treatments in the setting of his COVID pneumonia, especially if his respiratory status deteriorates.  We will closely follow up in the COVID unit after admission. 3.  Alteration of mental status and encephalopathy:  This in a patient who is hypoglycemic.  However, part of his encephalopathy related to his COVID infection and volume depletion.  He is being volume repleted and treated for his condition.  He will have frequent neurologic checks done after admission. 4.  Generalized weakness and deconditioning:  This is in a volume depleted patient with COVID.  His COVID will be appropriately treated and he will be volume repleted.  He will need to work with physical and occupational therapy towards the end of the hospitalization. 5.  Congestive heart failure, systolic plus diastolic dysfunction:  The patient does not have any evidence of acute congestive heart failure at the moment.  However, we will take care to prevent volume overload in this patient, who requires volume repletion in the setting of his volume depletion. 6.  Volume depletion:  The patient will get another liter of IV fluids after admission at 80 mL per hour as tolerated.  The goal is to avoid excessive IV fluid administration in this patient with COVID pneumonia.

At 12:30 am on 4/3/21 his mouth was very swollen and he couldn&#39;t talk. Also he had trouble breathing. He went to the ER and was given IV solu-medrol. Patient was sent home 30-40 minutes later with the instructions to take Benadryl PO. In the morning they purchased some benadryl and gave it PO every 4-6 hours all day Saturday, 4/3/21. On Sunday, 4/4/21 at about 5:30 am his gums and lips were swollen again. He made another trip to the ER and was given solu-medrol IV again and PO methylprednisolone for 5 days. At this visit, they also gave lasix IV due to extra fluid around his heart. He was told by the ER provider that he developed congestive heart failure due to the vaccine.  Patient followed up with his primary care provider on 4/8/21 and was told that his symptoms of congestive heart failure had resolved. Patient also reported his  symptoms of swollen gums and mouth had resolved at this time.

                                                I received the Johnson and Johnson/Janssen Covid-19 vaccine at the vaccination pod on Thursday, April 8th, 2021 (04-08-2021) at around 12:45 pm.  The next morning, Friday, April 9th, 2021 (04-09-2021), I woke up around 9:30 am and felt fine at first.  But after taking a drink of water, I felt nauseous.  I also had a pressure sensation in the center of my chest below my collarbone.  After contacting my doctor&#39;s office, my family called 911 at around 11:40 am to have the emergency squad take me to the hospital to be evaluated for a heart attack.  At the hospital, I was diagnosed with an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction.  I was taken to the catheterization lab for a heart catheterization and a stent was placed in my left anterior descending artery (LAD).  I was admitted to the hospital on Friday, April 9th, 2021 (04-09-2021) and discharged from the hospital on Saturday, April 10th, 2021 (04-10-2021).

Pt with history of bladder cancer (s/p TURBT 11/04/2020), COPD (quit smoking 1 month ago) on 2 L nocturnal O2, HTN, CAD, MI s/p CABG x3v, apical cardiac aneurysm s/p repair, recent hematuria requiring cessation of chronic warfarin therapy who presented on 2/14 as a direct admission for evaluation of NSTEMI and new LLE DVT. He was initially placed on heparin and was stopped due to anemia and hematuria. DVT at outside hospital, repeat dopplers negative at our institution. Acute R femoral DVT likely due to patient being taken off chronic anticoagulation with warfarin. Discussed case with heme and not needed for IVC filter......and even though cardiology would like him on long-term AC given high risk for LV thrombus, bleed risk outweigh benefit at this point. He was diagnosed with new HFrEF and NSTEMI. He will stay on hydralazine, imdur, lasix every other day, baby asa, and statin.

This started out mild and as the week went on got worse.  Symptoms were leg swelling, shortness of breath, persistent stomach pain, headache, and chestpain.  On 6/24 at 3:30 am he went to the ER where they discovered a large (golf ball size) blood clot in his right lung.  He also has been diagnosed with pancreatitis.  We have talked to five different doctors and multiple other hospital staff who all say it is a direct impact of the covid vaccine.

                                                Patient caregiver reports that he woke up at 2 a.m. the morning after the vaccine unable to hold his urine which is unusual for him.  He also reported extreme acid reflux symptoms whenever he attempted to drink any fluids at that time as well as nausea.  This progressed to difficulty breathing at which time the caregiver was alerted and checked his blood pressure.  This reading was 88/55 according to the caregiver and the pulse was very high as well but the actual number could not be remembered.  The difficulty breathing prompted them to alert emergency medical services where he was picked up and transported to the emergency room via ambulance shortly after for evaluation.

                                                PATIENT WAS ADMINISTERED THE JANSSEN COVID VACCINE AT APPROXIMATELY 10:30AM. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING REMOVAL OF NEEDLE AFTER INJECTION, THE PATIENT APPEARED TO FAINT FALLING FORWARD IN HIS OWN LAP. AFTER ABOUT 15 TO 30 SECONDS, HE REGAINED CONSCIOUS. WE ASSESSED THE PATIENT TO ASK IF HE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED FAINTING BEFORE  OR SPECIFICALLY DURING VACCINATION. HE HAD NO PREVIOUS EPISODES. WE QUICKLY OFFERED THE PATIENT SOME WATER AND CRACKERS WHILE HE REMAINED SEATED. THE PATIENT FELL FORWARD AGAIN AND APPEARED TO BE CONVULSING. ONCE HE STABILIZED, MY PARTNER STEPPED AWAY TO RETRIEVE WATER, AND THE PATIENT ONCE AGAIN FELL FORWARD AND BEGAN CONVULSING. ONCE HE STABILIZED, HE DRANK SOME WATER AND ATE SOME CRACKERS. HE MENTIONED THAT HE FELT EXTREMELY TIRED. WE INSISTED TO CALL THE PARAMEDICS FOR HELP,BUT HE DECLINED SAYING THAT HE WAS OK AND MAYBE THE NEEDLE TRIGGERED THE EVENT. AFTER WE OBSERVED THE PATIENT FOR 30 MINUTES AND HE ASSURED US HE WAS IN STABLE CONDITION, HE LEFT WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND. PATIENT WAS CALLED TWICE AFTER THE EVENT TO FOLLOW-UP BUT WE HAVE NOT HAD SUCCESS IN FOLLOW-UP.

                                                Rapid decline in ability to perform respiratory gas exchange and build up of carbon dioxide in the blood to life-threatening levels, ultimately leading to death. Rapid decline began about 2 weeks after receiving vaccine. Death would likely have occurred on  5/6/2021 or 5/7/2021 but for hospital intervention via use of a BiPAP machine. Patient had been exhibiting more mild, non-COVID respiratory distress for some time, back to at least late 2020, and likely at even lower levels for several years prior. Signs and symptoms included shallow breathing, extreme fatigue, difficulty or inability to lie down, occasional lightheadedness, etc. Oxygen saturation levels in April, as measured by a pulse oximeter, ranged from about 87%-96%. On May 6, it measured 65% just prior to ER visit.
