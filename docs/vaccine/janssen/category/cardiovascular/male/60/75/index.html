                                                Roughly a week following vaccination he cut his hand and was unable to stop the bleeding. 2 days later he developed mucosal lesions inside his mouth which began to bleed without resolution. He also cut himself shaving with prolonged bleeding. Following this event his rehabilitation center performed a CBC and he was found to be profoundly thrombocytopenic with platelets of 7. He presented to hospital where he was transfused with platelets which did not resolve his thrombocytopenia. He was transfused 2 more units with immediate CBC followup which did not improve his platelets; this was very suggestive of a consumptive process. Hematology was consulted and per their recommendations steroids were started. After initiation of systemic IV medrol platelet count began to rise. Per our hematology team, most likely culprit is the COVID vaccine. Patient had no medication changes, had been stable in his chronic conditions, and had never had any autoimmune or thrombocytopenic event before this time.

That evening, patient with increasing SOB and increasing oxygen requirement and was admitted for hypoxia &#43; LE swelling.  Although SNF where vaccination took place denied symptoms at time of vaccination, per H&amp;P, increasing oxygen requirements were noted 3 days prior to vaccination.   See H&amp;P below  He is currently residing in a rehab facility following a hospitalization detailed below, but essentially he noted some shortness of breath about 4-5 days ago. They checked his oxygen saturation and noted that he was hypoxic, so started him on oxygen (reportedly 4L NC?). He reports a worsened productive cough; sputum is dark but not bloody in color. He has been fatigued and chilled; he thinks he&#39;s been intermittently febrile. No nausea, vomiting, or constipation. He endorses twice daily diarrhea, but he associates this with his bowel regimen. He also has a fair amount of lower extremity swelling which is bothersome to him; he says this has been ongoing since his MVA in January.[KE.4] He was recently seen in Nephrology clinic, where he was started on lasix 40mg daily and started on a low sodium diet[KE.3]. He is unsure if the lasix is helping his swelling, but does have robust urine output after he takes it

                                                Patient began experiencing back pain on March 14 and on or around March 18 he started coughing up blood clots according to a coworker.  Patient lived alone and was unable to be reached on Sunday March 21.  I went over to his house and found him deceased in his bed.  Patient had a trashcan beside his bed and it appeared to have some blood in it. Patient had thick mucus coming out of his mouth and blood coming out of his nose.  According to paramedics he had passed a few hours before finding him.  Unfortunately Patient has been cremated so there is no way to say that this was related to the Covid 19 shot from Johnson and Johnson, however there are new reports that blood clots have been a side effect. I would like to speak with someone from the Department of Health to discuss this further.  I feel this could be related to the vaccination and I would to know how long the Health Department knew about this possible side effect.  If patient would have known sooner that the blood clots were a side effect I feel he would have gone to the Emergency Room.  Patient had no health insurance and he was trying to prevent getting Covid.   This has caused our family so much heartache and we are all very apprehensive about getting the Covid Vaccine ourselves.  Please contact me as soon as possible, I am also patient&#39;s  executor so I am able to speak to you on behalf of patient and our family. Thank you.

Today, April 17th, I believe they did a cat scan of his lungs to check for blood clots and I am not sure of the results.

Went o Clinic and was diagnosed with fluid in the ears and a sinus infection.  Went to work and only stayed 2 hours.

Was in intensive care Thur-Sat.

The hospital refused to believe me that i had some blood clot, they downplay the incident and instead gave me a brain CT SACN and brain  MRA which was negative, they kept me for observation overnight and let me go noon the next day.  since i have had follow ups with my regular doctor, a cardiologist and my nephrologist.  I know that reaction was due to medication, either way glad i got the shot.  BUT Since this time, I am retaining water, i know this because my rings do not fit anymore, rings i had for 20 years, never ever once had a hard time to put on or remove. I know my body, thats not the worse of it. i test my blood pressure every day at requesting of my kidney doctor,   since the incudent of my pressure 198/112 my diastolic on average is raised  20 points.  I log this daily.  here are some examples from before the medication  111/67 ,  109/63 ,   129/64 , 105/62 120/81.   now my pressure is totally different for example, 155/88  150/91  157/90 ,  134/88.  nothing else changed in my life, I am exactly the same as before only now i have covid shot..  yesterday i saw the 4th doctor since i am shot up and she gave me a new pill  olmesartan medoxomil,  only on it one day but my diastolic pressure is still much higher than before.  i dont want to die, i dont want a stroke, or a heart attach, i have a lot to live for still.  nobody is helping me, doctors are just throwing pills at me and not treating root cause which i feel strongly to beleive it is from covid shot.

He got light headed and started to pass out.  A pharmacy technician was able to get to him in time and guide him to the ground. He was unresponsive for 10-30 seconds. Before we could take further action he regain consciousness. After a couple minutes he wanted to go back to chair. Within a minute he lost color and passed back out. This time he came back sooner and stayed on the ground till EMSA arrived. Only BP we got was several minutes into the event 124/82 HR 54. Paramedics did not transport the pt.

Upon admissions, she stated he was tested for COVID and the test came back as positive. Wife upset due to the belief that the shot has caused her husbands condition and that we should be aware that hospitals are still testing for COVID and considering it positive even though her husband had been vaccinated.  I tried to explain that he had not had the two full weeks since being vaccinated to have full immunity and that he could have been exposed early enough that he was still able to develop into actual illness.

                                                For the first two weeks, there was only mild headache and fatigue.  But on day 12 (or 13) following the shot, my husband had severe abdominal pain and black, tarry poop.  He passed out on the toilet in the middle of the night and hit his head, woke up in a puddle of blood (from hitting his head) . He was severely lightheaded, short of breath, could not walk.  He had to crawl back to bed.  He continued to have severe  lightheadedness, shortness of breath, muscle aches, abdominal pain, and also ringing in his ears.  He called me early Saturday morning and told me what happened and that he called out from work.  (We do not live together. He is 280 miles away because of his job.) That man has called out sick only one time since I&#39;ve met him in 1998; so when he told me he did not go to work, I knew it had to be really bad.  I drove up there ASAP the same day, and I took the pulse oximeter with me.  His oxygen levels were all over the place.  They were usually better (like high 70s to low 80s) while he was lying down.  When he would sit up or stand up, the number would plummet, reading so low I thought he was going to die. One time his finger was so cold that it took me 4 tries to get a reading.  It read at 55, but I realize that might be because his finger was too cold.

Patient then fainted in his chair and was initially non-responsive to the nurse. At this time I called 911. The nurse administered a single epi pen in patient&#39;s quad and he woke up. The nurse then took patient&#39;s vitals at 1138: BP - 109/73; P-84; SPO2-99%; T-97.4; R-16. Patient stating he was still feeling dizzy and fatigued. The paramedics arrived and took patient to hospital for continued evaluation. I called patient later in the afternoon and he had already been discharged and was at home resting and feeling better.

About 10 minutes into the waiting time, patient became very pale, and stated that were having chest pain. Patient was given water and their blood pressure was taken, it resulted in a BP of 70/60. The patient was laid down on the ground, and legs raised, and after another 10 minutes the BP was taken again and resulted in 118/78, at this point the patient was feeling much better. However, to be precautious, the patient was rolled out in a wheel chair to make sure hypotension did not occur again. Patient stated that at 11:30 they had a scheduled appointment already with their doctor and said they would discuss with them the adverse reaction of the previous couple hours.

We went to healthcare facility at 4:30pm.  He was diagnosed with Acute Pancreatitis.  He was sent home at 10:30pm    We went back to ED at 1:30 am Thursday.  He was admitted during the day.  In the early morning of Friday May 28th his blood pressure tanked and he became unresponsive.  His heart stopped and they did compressions for 8-9 minutes.  He was put into ICU.  By 3am we were told he may not survive.  By 5 am we were told his organs were shutting down.  He passed around 7:45am.  In researching the vaccine we discovered the SARS virus used in vaccine can attack the pancreas.  We believe he died as a result of the reaction to the vaccine and his body and organs could not fight.

No difficulty breathing/swallow, thus gave water and gatorade. He was responsive to my questions. He has history of anxiety to needles and he did not eat lunch before vaccine. He stayed seated for 1 hour to monitor. Then, walked an aisle before driving home. Asked him to eat first before driving home. Called him twice and he is home and feeling okay. Counseled to call pharmacy if any symptoms of allergic reaction to vaccine.

                                                On Monday March 8th I went to the Pharmacy to get the Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine under the new 1b guidelines. I am a 62 year old white male with type 1 diabetes, insulin dependent for the past 49 years. I filled out the question form I was presented by the staff and then was given a dose of the J&amp;J vaccine. This vaccine was administered at approx. 1:30 p.m. I was asked to wait 15 minutes to see if I had and acute reaction, following none, I was told I could leave. There rest of the day I was fine. I went to bed at 11:00 p.m. and within 15 minutes I was cold, shaking and sick on my stomach. I took my temp and it was 100.2 F My O2 sat was 95% and heart rate was 120 with feelings of palpitations from time to time. I went to the bathroom and stayed there the rest of the night with frequent vomiting and loose stool. Stomach cramps all night long. Several BGL were taken and even with an insulin pump I was not able to lower my 299 level for over the next 24 hours of repeated bolus. I was finally able to stop dry heaves and fall asleep for moments at a time around 5:00 a.m. My temp finally broke around 11:00 a.m. the next day Tuesday. I had a headache this entire time. I called hospital ( Ask a Nurse ) on Tuesday morning around 8:00 a.m.and enquired about side effects for this vaccine and effects on a type 1, they basically told me to go to the ER or Clinic and be seen by a Physician. I choose not to do either, but to monitor myself and see how the rest of the day went. The first time, other than a headache and complete body soreness my vitals and BGL, were WNL,  was late Tuesday evening around 7:00 p.m. This was a horrible set of side effects. Onset was within 11 hours from injection. No warning for type 1 people to be careful for the possibilities of increased BGL. Today is Wednesday March 10th, and my vitals have remained WNL, but I still have a mild headache and body soreness, some maybe from the vaccine but I believe mostly from the throwing up. Today is March 11th, my vitals are still WNL and BGL is in target. BGL control is responsive to pump therapy now. The past 2 nights I have awoken in a cold soaking sweat that cannot be tied to a low BGL. My body is somewhat still soreness.

The ER Doctor gave me a nitroGlycerin pill to get the blood pressure down.  They did multiple test on my heart.  The pain went away once the blood pressure went down.  I spent the nite in the hospital and was released after numerous test the next day.

                                                Received the vaccine approximately 12:22 PM on Saturday, April 10, 2021.  At approximately 6:55 pm that same day (Saturday, April 10, 2021) my husband collapsed in our living room.  I called 911 and the operator talked me through how to do chest compression CPR on my husband until the paramedics arrived.  My husband was then taken by ambulance to hospital where doctor performed an emergency procedure wherein he removed the blood clot in one of my husband&#39;s stints (he has three) that he had put in in 2017. Doctor was able to eventually stabilize my husband&#39;s heart.  My husband spent 5 days in the hospital as a result of this.

                                                He received the vaccine, had very painful going in and tingling going down his left arm and to the elbow which was numb, and the left little finger was numb, and a dizzy spell afterward which was typical for him.  He then on the 9th day had extreme intercostal pain in the ribs on the right side and his right shoulder extremely painful, low grade fever, chills, fatigue and inability to draw a full breath.  He called the doctor and they were on the way to the clinic they told him to go to the ER based on his symptoms.  He went to the ER and they admitted him and did blood work, and then did a chest x-ray, then a chest CT scan and it was positive for pulmonary embolism.  He was treated with an anti-inflammatory through the IV and a blood thinner to the stomach.  He was hospitalized for 1 full day, and discharged home with Eliquis double dose for 14 days and then a single dose until further notice.    He is still having fatigue and aches on the right side of his brain and aches in his feet, but is to see a pulmonologist for his lungs, as it will take up to 6 months for it to resolve.  He also has damage to the right side of the heart and lung.  Is waiting to get a CT of the brain.

I got headaches, those have also continued since the 13th.  The following week my mouth began to hurt, I started coughing more than normal. First a dry cough, now I&#39;m coughing up phlegm with specks of blood. And I can not stop itching, and I&#39;m getting tired of taking benadryl for it. I contacted my doctor, all I got was these are normal reactions to the vaccine. They last 2 to 4 weeks. I already get migraines, my gut is picky since that shot. I used to eat hot peppers, now if I use pepper on my dinner my stomach is in pain. These side effects should be gone by now. I am one pissed off person.

                                                I started to get a weird feeling in my chest a week after the vaccine. It was a burning sensation and I thought it was vaping at first. It started to get worse and worse. A week later I went to the ER and they ran some tests. After testing it was confirmed that I was having a heart attack. I had blot clot in my OM1discovered on 04/07/2021. I had had an angiogram in 2019 and there were no problems then. I was hospitalized for four days and I was given a Stent which ended up getting a blood clot. The original Stent was removed and a larger one was put in. I am now taking some blood thinners, Aspirin, Atorvastatin, Carvedilol 6mg, Prasugrel 10mg, and I am scheduled to see a cardiologist because I still a have a little chest pain.

It was low ~90/55. Asked again how he was doing, stated okay but feeling chills/cold. Started to shake uncontrollably. Ask pt if he thought a hospital visit was necessary; he stated no at that time. Decision was made to call squad; BP was elevated now and still shaking. Transported at that time.

                                                Patient passed out after receiving janssen covid-19 vaccine. There was no injection site reaction, no wheezing, or rash/hives. Patient had vision loss, dilated pupils, sweaty, unable focus or respond to use questions being asked, and  was having trouble hearing-said he had ringing in his ears. We were able to lay him on the floor without injuries-he did not fall. I was fanning him and we were talking to him. He got a little worse but then got better. When he was better, he said that he had passed out before when having blood taken. He did not mention this to me before the vaccine was administered. I do not feel that the Janssen COVID shot was the cause, I think he just passes out from injections or needles. We did call 911 when he was getting worse. By the time they got here, he was better but they did check him.

Doctor has all my information and should be reporting the event also to VAERS.

Narrative from family below:  &#34;Day 1 (The day he took the vaccine): My father was complaining of very heavy chest pressure (said he felt like his chest was being pushed down with force.) He felt really tired and had a nasty headache.   Day 2 He began to feel tingles in his legs and arms. Said he felt sore and had mild pain around his back, feet, legs, hands, and arms. The headache came in and out.   Day 3 He began feeling more severe pains in both legs &#43; headache. More tingling around his face, lips, and jaw.  Day 4 Severe pain continued around his entire body. Had an episode where he lost vision from 1 eye (he described it as blurry vision) felt like he was going blind from one eye.  Day 5 Could barely stand on his two feet and could no longer go to work. He stayed in bed and then hospital visits began. My mom took him to emergency for the first time.  I was able to get details of the location where he was vaccinated and onsite contact information. The info is below:

                                                On Jan. 26, 2021, I had an accident at home an suffered  broken ankle, tibia and fibula broken from tarsus.  I was rushed to hospital and had ORIF surgery.  I later found out the surgeons failed to order blood thinners and about a month later, I was rushed to the hospital with 5 blood clots, one in each lobe or each lung and one forming in the calf muscle on the left leg.  I have been taking Eliquis since late February and will be on it through May.  I have had an echocardiogram which was normal but the doppler I had on my legs may have indicated the problem is still on-going.  I don&#39;t know yet.  I did contract JCCT to ask if I should get checked out due to recent clotting incidents and was told I did not.  I decided I should report it anyway and my clotting situation probably has nothing to do with vaccine but I just want to make sure.

                                                Four days after the vaccine I felt a little chest tightness but the next day it was very scary like a weight on my chest. I also had a cough that was an uncontrollable tickle and then I had trouble catching my breath. I went to the Urgent Care they just thought I had Acid Reflux.. Seven days after my cough was worse and I was very short of breath and I had very bad night sweats. I went to the doctor he gave me Asthma medicine. Two weeks after the vaccine I went back to the Urgent care and they thought Bronchitis. I went back to the ER and I saw a Covid-19 doctor and he thought I had Covid-19 symptoms. He gave me Prednisone and Azithromycin. I took the Prednisone for ten days and I finally started to feel better. I was trying to chew some fresh ginger helped the cough. I have a Heart Echo scheduled next week and I am still a little short of breath. Before the shot I used to walk two or three miles a day and go fishing every day but I can?t do that right now. At least I am back to 80% now which is better.

About 10 minutes following administration of Janssen vaccine, patient began turning pale and said that he felt dizzy. Moments after, patient fainted and was out for about 30 seconds. During this time, 911 was called and then patient came to but was still very pale and lips were blue. EMTs came minutes later and took patient to ambulance to be checked out. Patient was feeling better by then and did not leave in ambulance.

                                                I didn&#39;t have anything for two weeks. But then a lot of pain in arm. from a sound sleep. I took ibuprofen. Over the next few  hours,   the pain radiated down my left arm. Wave would come and go (of pain). The pain came on to my chest - and I decided to go get check.  Had very low energy for about four days - after that. My left arm, I lost the strength in it - I could barely lift 10 lbs over my head. Swimming - I couldn&#39;t pull my arm with my elbow high - I could barely skim the top of the water. This is still happening.  I had a doctor appt - yesterday but that was for arthritis pain that is in my knees, wrists etc - he gave me arthritis medication and I noticed the positive affects of it already. But it didn&#39;t address the arm that I can&#39;t pull up over my head. It seems like my immune system is attacking me- a couple of years ago this happened when I had a virus and it took me almost a year to get that muscle to start working again.

It felt like sudden pneumonia and chronic bronchitis onset. The second day was very serious in the third day and the fourth day I started to regain strength. I received an antibiotic on day 2 after my vaccine. I went from my normal daily activities to bedrest for 3 1/2 days straight. I called out sick from work because of it. I&#39;m glad I was well versed with my chronic illnesses because it helped me handle the adverse event that started after receiving my vaccine. I feel that if I was a normal person I would have gone to the hospital.

                                                My tinnitus is worse on right ear, gotten worse than on my last visit.  My tinnitus had not gone away. I I went to see my doctor who ordered  MRI of the brain and ears with and without contrast. My MRI was negative, nothing abnormal. Also did a full hearing test, other than normal range of hearing loss.  The tinnitus is more variable, louder than it was, get periods of quietness.    I have noticed that my tinnitus gets louder during exercise. I can not find rhyme or reason that my tinnitus gets quieter and louder.  I have no problem for the CDC to contact my PCP to help with my diagnosis.  I also had severe nose bleeds, which have subsided now.  My skin rashes are also gone and get treated with topical creams.  Before my vaccine, I had oily skin and now I noticed my skin started to get dry, along with tinnitus, and also dry skin on my scalp.  When I get dry skin I apply topical lotion.

                                                Patient received vaccine on 3/13, initially had fatigue and myalgia the day after, which resolved, but also on 3/14 began having mild intermittent coughing, nonproductive, occurring every two hours or less. Patient began having some blood in his sputum since this morning at 4AM, and that occurred twice more with intervals of a few hours, both continuously improving and less blood. No other symptoms. No history of TB, no exposure to sick contacts, no recent travel. Unlikely a pulmonary embolus given normal vital signs and no risk factors. Patient was doing outdoor work in his yard for the past few days before the symptom onset and was working on mulch and compost. Although unlikely to have fungal infection currently, may be bacterial pneumonia

When he pulled up his pant leg, he saw the small little red spots that were exquisitely tender. He went immediately to his primary care physician&#39;s office, where he was prescribed Bactrim for suspected cellulitis. The rash steadily worsened with extension up his left leg and onto his right leg and blistering of some of the lesions most markedly in his groin. Pain associated with the rash increased and remained most severe on the lateral aspect of the left ankle. He presented back to his primary care physician&#39;s office on 3/19, where he was given methylprednisolone 80 milligrams IV, discharged with a prescription for prednisone 60 milligrams daily for the next few days. Pain worsened the morning of 3/20/21 to the point that he was unable to bear much weight on the left leg prompting his presentation to the emergency department.

I didn&#39;t think much of this until the recent reports on the Johnson and Johnson vaccine started circulating. I&#39;ve had no other issues.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included blood pressure.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805020, expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 08-APR-2021 between 09.30 and 09.40 to left arm for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) for blood pressure. On 08-APR-2021, 20 minutes after vaccination, the patient started having symptoms. The patient&#39;s heart started aching and that lasted for 15-20 minutes and then went away. On 09-APR-2021, the patient had chills that had lasted for four hours. On 10-APR-2021, the patient could not move his neck left or right and back of his head felt like it was swelling and  tender; he also had a headache, and he was extremely sleepy. The patient&#39;s neck and head tenderness lasted three to four days. On 11-APR-2021, the patient eyes had blood shot and were red and reported that he might had a stroke or blood clot. On 17-APR-2021, he had a knot came up in the center of right arch on foot. On 19-APR-2021, at the time of this report, the patient&#39;s eyes were still red and had a slight headache; the patient&#39;s neck still hurts, he was sleepy, and the knot was still there on his right arch of his foot. The patient took acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) but he was already taking that for his blood pressure. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from heart ache on 08-APR-2021, head swelling and tender on 14-APR-2021, and chills on 09-APR-2021, and had not recovered from neck hurts/could not move neck, bloodshot in eye/eyes were red, headache, sleepy, and knot in center of right arch of foot. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 64-year-old African American (non-Hispanic/Latino) hypertensive male patient reported &#34;heart aching&#34; 20 minutes after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The event lasted for 15-20 minutes.  Other associated symptoms developed in the succeeding 3 days: chills that lasted for hours, could not move his neck and felt it was swelling and tender, headache, sleepiness, blood shot eyes.  Nine days after vaccination, the patient reported he had a knot in the center of arch right foot.  The patient took Aspirin.  No other details was reported.  The event is confounded by the underlying hypertension.  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

He denies any associated trauma, recent travel and immobility.  He is not taking any new prescription, including steroids. One day prior to admission, he started experiencing left-sided pleuritic chest pain up to 9/10 in intensity and exertional shortness of breath.  He denies any fevers, hemoptysis, sputum production, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness or lightheadedness.  The pain was persistent throughout the day.  Today, his chest pain persisted and his shortness of breath had progressed.  He also noted left arm swelling with mild discomfort.  He felt that his left leg swelling and pain had improved today.  Nevertheless, given persistent symptoms, he decided to come to the emergency room for further evaluation management.   In the emergency room, his initial blood pressure was 218/104 with mild tachycardia of 99, normal oxygen saturation and no fevers.  CBC showed a white count of 12.35, hematocrit of 50.4 and normal platelet count 198.  INR was normal at 1.06.  BMP showed mild hyperglycemia at 148.  Troponin was 5 and BNP was 8.

                                                I felt dizzy and had problems with breathing right away after the injection. A doctor from that site who checked my vitals wanted to call an ambulance to take me to a hospital. I couldn&#39;t let this happen as I was 120 miles away from my apartment, where two dogs were left unattended. I decided to come back home and monitor my vital signs. Since that time, I had almost every other day a chest pain and high blood pressure and low level of O2 but was too busy at work to care of myself. On 04.30.2021 around 3am I decided to drive into ER at where I was admitted and had CABG surgery on Tuesday 05/04/2021.

Then I started to get a severe headache that was pretty constant. After multiple days, my face became paralyzed. I also experienced severe fatigue. This was over 10 days. Once paralysis happened we went to the Medical Center. I was treated with IVIG for many days and oral steroids. I was in the hospital for 6 days. I also experienced my BP spiking. I had an abnormal EKG. I&#39;m still unable to chew properly. I was told that now I have Encephalitis and GBS (Gillian Barres syndrome).

I started having an intermittent cough due to the vaccine (felt like my lungs were not feeling great) This occurred during the evening and at night when I would lay down to rest. I had a fairly mild case of COVID-19 (tested at the beginning) and quarantined for three weeks. A month later I took the blood test for antibodies (actually had COVID-19 last June which is nearly a year ago before taking the Janssen vaccine). My blood sugar is off the charts and my blood pressure has elevated since taking the vaccine (reason for awaiting an appointment with my doctor).

                                                I started feeling bad the first night. I woke up with energy @ 1am and then later that day I started feeling extremely drain and exhausted and very tired and weak. I woke up @ 11:30pm and I passed out and hit hit the floor, face first and my wife don&#39;t know how long I was passed out up to 30- to 60 mins. I had to put frozen meat on my face. I felt like I was about to pass out again. Felt like my legs was giving out. I do have a spinal disease and it felt worse then that. Then it took my headache away. I felt like a different person.

                                                April 20, 2021. PT needed to use the restroom.  We stopped, he walked to the restroom, I went to the gift shop. Upon returning, I saw PT sitting on a bench. He was leaning to his left, could not see out of his left eye, very unstable when sitting. We missed lunch, so we thought it was his sugar dropping. I started to feed him jam and a chocolate bar. After 2 hours, his vision returned &amp; he seemed better. He drove us back to the rental cabin. He rested the next 2 days.  Then on Friday, we packed up our vehicle and Pt drove us back home. After arriving home, Pt&#39;s condition got worse. We went to the Dr, explained the events of the previous week &amp; she came to the same conclusion, Diabetes spell. His condition continued to worsen, we went back to Dr several times, the ER 2 times and finally we got into see a Neurologist. That appointment, the doctor said he thought stroke. Dr scheduled a MRI for June 1, 2021. Results of that MRI was a definite stroke. Now he has started outpatient rehab with no promise he will ever regain full mobility. He can no longer drive, mow grass, walk without a cane and help, etc. Life has changed dramatically for both of us.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension and congestive heart failure, presents with shortness of breath that started on Friday and worsened significantly this morning.  He does have some chest discomfort with this.  No fevers, chills, or other complaints.  Discharge Diagnoses   1. Hypertensive emergency, 04/13/2021  2. Chest discomfort, 04/14/2021  3. Heart failure, systolic, 04/13/2021  Assessment and Plan 65M w/ HTN and HFrEF p/w hypoxic respiratory failure i/s/o a hypertensive emergency. BP and respiratory status much improved, admitted to CCU for acute BP management and medication titration.   #HTN Emergency Likely precipitated by lack of medication non-adherence since 04/11, when he ran out of his medications. SBP approx 220 at time of presentation, good response to enalapril and nitro gtt. Decreased work of breathing with Bi-pap. MAP 130-140 on presentation, will attempt to lower by 20-25% in first 2-6hrs w/ MAP goal of approx 100, while aiming towards normotensive in next 24-48 hrs while transitioning from IV to PO meds. -TTE ordered -cont incremental BP mgmt:  -goal MAP &lt; 110    -prn hydralazine  -gradual goal towards normotensive over next 24-48hrs thereafter -cardiac monitor -will ensure that patient has anti-hypertensives prior to DC -q4hr neuro checks  #Acute Hypoxic and Hypercapnic respiratory failure  Decreased work of breathing with Bi-pap. Likely related to HTN emergency as above in addition to moderate-severe volume overload as seen on CXR. VBG in am of 4/13 showed pH 7.17, pCO2 64, pO2 58, bicarb 24. -cont Bi-pap, will wean as tolerable  -repeat VBG this am for resp acidosis  #HFrEF w/ acute exacerbation Last echo 04/14/2017, LVEF 38%, cxr on admission shows moderate-severe volume overload. -TTE ordered on 4/13 -may consider additional diuresis, given furosemide in ED on presentation, mindful of BP -goal net negative 1-2L/24hrs as pressures permit -daily standing weights -fluid and sodium restriction when off Bi-Pap  #NSTEMI Likely type II given HTN emergency, did have chest pain on presentation which was relieved with BP control. -trend trops until flat, next at 08:00  #type II DM Hgb A1c 7.5% on 4/13, mild hyperglycemia on presentation -SSI  #polycythemia Could be indicative of undiagnosed OSA vs manifestation of heart failure. Additionally, hemoconcentration from CHF i/s/o HTN emergency is another possibility. -TTE as above -ctm w/ am labs  #lymphocytosis Afebrile, no urinary symptoms. Hypoxic on presentation, likely related to edema i/s/o HTN emergency as above. No suspicion for infectious etiology at this time, no white count. -ctm w/ am labs  #HLD -cont statin  #QTC prolongation 561 on 4/13/2021 -avoid QTc prolonging medications

                                                About 2 minutes after vaccine injection patient became pale, hands became cold and purplish. Patient&#39;s head leaned to the left side,  started slurring and became unconcious while his eyes were open.  I tried to get the patient&#39;s attention but saying &#34;hello, are you still with me?&#34; loudly and he did not respond.  His eyes were still open at the time. At that point I yelled for help and other colleagues were calling &#34;911&#34; immediately. Based on store protocol and knolwedge of  CPR and CDC guidlines, I checked for pulse and respiration - did not have any.  I grabbed epinephrine injection 0.3 mg and injected him on left thigh. He immediately gasped for air, then started to faint again. His face color turned pale. At this point he is still sitting upright and EMT has arrived. His blood pressure was lower than normal based on EMT report.  I called the patient on 5/12/21 (one day post-event) and patient reported no adverse reaction from vaccine site, he also reported taking 1.5 hours nap. The injection site on epineprhine injection was somewhat painful.

During the night I woke up overheated and bathed in sweat. Got up to go to the bathroom for BM but was nauseous, feeling need to vomit at the same time. After BM I stood and still felt need to  do one or the other or both when I passed out. Wife came upstairs and found me sitting up against the corner wall. She was able to shake me awake while calling 911. I was groggy but aware I was still nauseous and  stayed down next to toilet until stomach settled. I came downstairs and EMTs arrived. Took blood pressure. Result was it was low. Took EKG and that was normal. Second  blood pressure test  showed that I rebounded.  When offered I felt it unnecessary to go to hospital.

Shortly after, a few seconds, the patient stated he felt flushed and head started to fall back. Staff member cradled his head and called another staff member over.  Staff member called 9-1-1.  Patient went unconscious and his eyes rolled back for approximately 30 seconds.  When aware, we (staff members) transferred patient from the chair to the floor where staff member supported his back and fanned him due to his profuse sweating.  Staff member continued talking to him when he became unconscious again, this time gasping for air and turning pale.  We kept saying his name until he came to again and was somewhat aware of his surroundings.  He fainted one last time.  After this time, he sat up on his own and seemed to be very coherent.  The EMS arrived shortly after and took over.  They said they would take him out to check him out but he seemed to be doing better.  An EMS personnel let us know the patient did tell him that he has fainted from vaccines before.  However, he did not disclose this to us on the PQCF form or when asked verbally.

                                                Suspected pneumonitis.  Patient presented on day following vaccination as shortness of breath, nausea, and diarrhea were not abating with home management. They had started later in the day after the vaccination.  At ER admission - SpO2 = 80% room air. Nasal cannula was applied and SpO2 recovered quickly.  BNP was elevated so acute exacerbation of heart failure was suspected and treated. However, patient did not improve with diuresis.  Viral workup and bacterial cause workup negative. No acute cardiac events discovered. Patient continued to decline. Transferred to ICU on 3-19-21 to use BiPAP with 65% FiO2 and able to take breaks to 15L nasal cannula. Borderline blood pressures at this time.  Infectious disease, pulmonology, cardiology, nephrology, and critical care anesthesia services evaluated and ruled out multiple possible diagnoses and patient continued to decline.  Diagnostic bronchoscopy on 3-22-21 with BAL lead to patient ventilator dependent with profound hypotension.  Aggressive ICU management ensued.  Bronchoscopy very clean with no real secretions - in line with CT evidence of pneumonitis.  Despite aggressive care and maximized pressor support, patient expired on 3-29-21 when family chose to withdraw care as blood pressure declined again.

                                                In office patient evaluation performed 27 days after patient received J &amp; J covid vaccine at a vaccine site.   Symptoms at presentation were:  4 week history of post vaccine fatigue, decreased stamina, exertion related tachycardia, and dyspnea on exertion.  Patient is a regular exerciser  with a high fitness level. Exam was unrevealing. Lab testing included CBC CMP thyroid profile ESR C-reactive protein Lyme titers and D-dimer.  All were normal/negative.    The reportable lab findings were:  SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG antibody titers were zero on the initial evaluation.  Six days later SARS-COV-2 IgG, IgM, and IgA titers were done at Lab.  All titers were zero.  So 4 and 5 weeks after receiving the J &amp; J vaccine, this patient had no antibody response.  He has no underlying disease process known to me to explain this finding.  My concern is possible administration of faulty J &amp; J vaccine which may have been distributed before the manufacturing error was identified.

                                                Since March 7 (the day I got the J&amp;J shot coincidentally), I have been experiencing dizziness (lightheadedness), weakness, racing heart from time to time (very badly after I did a work out on the day of the vaccination), tingling in my feet, jitters (like having too much caffeine), fatigue, and being cold (more than usual). Things have gotten progressively worse as I now cannot walk up a flight of stairs without a racing heart and heavy breathing and extreme exhaustion. (FYI, before this I was running 4-5 miles 4-5 times a week). In addition, my doctor tells me that I have no Covid-19 protection based on blood tests.

The patient was seated in a chair with arms.  Within a couple of minutes of administering the vaccine, his eyes rolled back in his head, he broke out in a cold sweat, BP was 75/55, pulse 55.  He never stopped breathing (was snoring); epinephrine for an anaphylactic reaction was not indicated.  I offered to call 911 multiple times but his wife said this was the normal course of his reaction and held an icepack on his neck for the duration.  After 5-10 minutes the patient was once again responsive.  He sat for an additional 10 minutes and then said he was ready to leave.  His wife walked him out of the store.

                                                I didn&#39;t have pain in the arm, after an hour I had a slight headache. The headache lasted about a day. After the 3-4 day I had serve diarrhea and stopped taking my supplements. It stopped for a couple days then came back for a day. I had no headache or pain, just 3 bad episodes of diarrhea. On March 24th I went into the Hospital with severe pain in my lower left back side. I thought I was passing a kidney side, with the pain I was having. When I got there they did a CT scan and blood work and it wasn&#39;t kidney stone but I had a blood clot on the lower left side of lung and the right side as well. They immediate put me on blood thinners. I was there for a day and a night. They released and put me on medication.  I&#39;ve had minor pain but nothing like the pain I had before. I have since followed up with a Pomologist and PCP. Pulmonologist said I had blood clots but couldn&#39;t give me a cause. My PCP said she thought I had or have Covid. I asked to have my blood drawn and she said it was too late for that because I had taken the vaccine already.

                                                Had vaccine 7-March at 4:15 PM. One week later, 14-March, woke up at 8:15 AM with severe BPPV. Went to doctor and had Epley Maneuver performed a few days later.  Then on 23-March woke up at 4:15 AM with another BPPV event.  Again, returned to doctor for Epley Maneuver.  Then on 2-April went to ENT Doctor to have ears checked.  She performed the Epley Maneuver and everything was fine; there was no nystagmus. Then she laid me down on my back and tilted my head off the table and I had the worse dizziness ever, but no nystagmus.  She sat me up.  My BP jumped to 190/100; pulse 100.  I couldn&#39;t stop being dizzy. Paramedics took me to emergency room.   After 2 hours the doctor performed the Epley Maneuver, but there was no nystagmus so it wasn&#39;t BPPV.  Had CT scan and MRI and everything was clear.  What changed and what may have caused all this was that I had the J&amp;J vaccine prior to all the dizziness.

                                                DVT (LEFT CALF); PULMONARY EMBOLISM (BOTH LUNGS); ATRIAL FIBRILLATION; BLOOD CLOT IN RIGHT VENTRICLE; This spontaneous report was received from a consumer (patient&#39;s wife) and concerned a 68 year old male. The patient&#39;s weight was 250 pounds and was obese (body mass index 40) and sedentary. His height was not provided. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included high blood pressure, and 2 gout attacks in the last 8 months. The last gout attack was 2 weeks ago in the left foot. There was no history of clots or atrial fibrillation. He had a strong family history of thrombosis: his father had 2 episodes of deep vein thrombosis and his mother had a pulmonary embolism. No testing to identify any familial clotting issues have been performed. The patient developed a cough starting 29-MAR-2021 and, prior to vaccination, took a COVID-19 test on 31-MAR-2021 which was negative. On 02-APR-2021 a rapid COVID-19 test also came back negative.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 043A21A, and expiry: UNKNOWN) on 02-APR-2021 at approximately 19:00 in the left arm for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, and losartan for high blood pressure. On 03-APR-2021, the patient&#39;s cough persisted but had not worsened and he developed pain in the ribs on the right. His wife checked his pulse, which seemed fast and irregular. His respiratory rate was 22 breaths per minute and his oxygen saturation with a home pulse oximeter was in the 70s. He was not in distress at the time. The patient called his physician and the doctor suggested to go to Emergency room. The patient went to Emergency room at approximately 10:00. An echocardiogram revealed a number of clots in the right ventricle which were &#34;bouncing all around&#34;. He was also found to be in atrial fibrillation which the doctors said was secondary to the ventricular clots. Unspecified tests revealed a saddle pulmonary embolus and a deep vein thrombosis on the left.  He was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (left calf), pulmonary embolism (both lungs), blood clots in right ventricle and atrial fibrillation. Platelet count was not known by the reporter; it is unknown if  D-dimer and fibrinogen levels were performed.  He underwent emergency surgery at 19:00, during which most of the ventricular clots and the pulmonary embolism were removed. He was placed on heparin after the surgery. He spent 5 days in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 2 additional days in the hospital. The patient was discharged from the hospital after 1 week and had recovered from the events of deep vein thrombosis (left calf), pulmonary embolism (both lungs), atrial fibrillation, and blood clots in right ventricle.  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The reporter did not believe that the covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s had caused deep vein thrombosis (left calf), pulmonary embolism (both lungs), atrial fibrillation, and blood clot in right ventricle This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  a 68-year-old male experienced left deep vein thrombosis, saddle pulmonary embolism, right ventricular thrombosis, and atrial fibrillation, approximately 15 hours after receiving the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine for prevention of COVID-19 infection.  The patient has a history of hypertension, is obese (BMI 40) and has a strong family history of blood clots.  He tested negative for COVID 2 days before and the day of vaccine administration.  He developed a cough 4 days prior to vaccination. The morning after vaccination, he developed right rib pain; his heart rate was rapid and irregular, and oxygen saturation with home pulse oximeter was in the 70s.  Upon arrival in the emergency room, he was found to have clots in the right cardiac ventricle, a saddle pulmonary embolus, left deep vein thrombosis and new-onset atrial fibrillation.  He underwent surgery for removal of the ventricular clots and pulmonary embolism.  No laboratory details were provided.  Given the symptoms which pre-dated vaccine administration,  the short latency between the vaccine administration and the event, and multiple risk factors for embolism and thrombosis (family history, obesity, sedentary nature), the events are assessed as inconsistent with the causal association to immunization, per the WHO causality classification for adverse events following immunization. Therefore, company causality is considered not related to the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.

I told him that headaches were a very common adverse reaction and that many people had experienced headaches after vaccination.  I told him that from my experience it usually didn&#39;t last more than a day for others and I assured him that it should go away soon.  I later talked to him and found out that he had went to the Emergency room that Wednesday evening (4/7/2021) because the headache was so bad.  He was seen in the ER, observed overnight, released the next morning, and then had a follow up appointment with his primary care physician on 4/15/2021.  He also had a very high blood pressure reading he told me in the Emergency room that evening he was evaluated.

By March 8th the swelling and pain in my left leg was so bad I made an appointment with Dr. for March 11th. He ordered another sonogram and found 2 DVTs in my left leg, and prescribed anti-coagulants whyich I am still on. At the time the Doctor said that this was most likly a result of having stood in line for 2&amp;1/2 hours.

Then incredibly painful bone pain in the chest - originally thought it was a heart attack.  It is random  and acute pain in the chest / rib area. It varies in duration and length of time between attacks. The pain is so acute it is hard to manage. Also this appears to have attacked my lungs as I am very short of breath and cannot do any exertion. The body ache, incredible chest bone pain, joint pain and difficulty breathing have continued as I finish day 6 post injection.

For about 5 minutes, I was unable to find words and properly communicate.  I went to the ER and was admitted and had a battery of tests, kept overnight, and discharged the following day  My statin dose was increased, and I was put on a baby aspirin, in addition to Pradaxa blood thinner.  i believe that I may have had a vascular thrombi related to the effect of the medicine/spike protein.

He presented to my office today acutely with a several day history of increasing shortness of breath.  He has increased his prednisone at home recently and been increasing the frequency of his DuoNebs.  Despite this, he states that his oxygen saturations have been staying in the low 80s.  He has a hard time walking due to the shortness of breath.  He states previous to about a week ago he was doing very well.  He denies any fever.  He denies any known exposure to coronavirus (COVID-19).  In the office today his oxygen saturations were 88% on 4 L. Because of his failure of outpatient therapy, he will be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.  This patient has a history of severe respiratory decompensation that happens very quickly.  Therefore, it is medically urgent we get him into the hospital.     3/25/21 Admission HPI71 y.o. male with a known history of severe COPD and type 2 diabetes mellitus.  He came to my office with a several day history of increasing shortness of breath.  He had increased his oral steroids and breathing treatments at home and despite this was still having oxygen saturations in the low to mid 80s on 2-4 L of supplemental oxygen.  In my office he was extremely diminished and had basically failed outpatient therapy.  Therefore he was admitted to inpatient status for acute treatment of a severe COPD exacerbation requiring IV antibiotics and IV steroids.  He was admitted and treated with IV treatments.  He did recover nicely.  However, he was found to be extremely physically deconditioned.  Because of this he was thought to be an excellent candidate for swing bed and is being transitioned to swing bed.    4/5/21 ER Practitioner Note: Upon arrival to ED trauma room I found patient to be in cardiac arrest, CPR in progress. History is that EMS was called to the scene for a patient with chest pain.  Shortly after arrival at his home  patient developed a cardiac arrest.  They followed standard ACLS  protocol and the patient was intubated. Blood sugar normal. As CPR was given, medications were administered consisting of epinephrine and 1 mg in 2 different doses along with 1 amp of bicarb. IV access via an IO. Patient was then transported to the emergency department.  Upon arrival, CPR was continued and oxygen supplied via endotracheal tube with good tube placement verified by auscultation and good sat readings.  Monitor was placed and patient demonstrated initially a sinus rhythm but there was no pulse.  Therefore, diagnosis was PEA and no reversible causes were identified.  ACLS protocol was followed with epinephrine 1 mg IV every 5 min.  He received a total that including EMS, 5 mg of epinephrine and 1 amp of bicarb.  Monitor at this point revealed the rhythm changed to an agonal rhythm.  When CPR was given, there was good results from the CPR.  However, CPR discontinued and there is no pulse and patient had an agonal  rhythm for several minutes, pupils were fixed but not dilated year.  Lungs demonstrating clear bilateral breath sounds when he was bagged via the endotracheal tube.  No external signs of any trauma noted. The patient&#39;s sister is here and she is a registered nurse.  We had discussed management at this point with her and all were in agreement that the code be terminated.  At 1015, patient was pronounced deceased..    ACLS protocol was followed.  See nursing record for medication and vital sign details.   Code outcome: Deceased   CC time 20 minutes.

Patient with known stroke on CT imaging, unable to further verify with MRI imaging.  Upon further investigation/discussion with the patient, he reports receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson Vaccine 10 days prior to admission.  Patient with known comorbidities which increase his risk of an embolitic stroke however with recent findings from the CDC, unsure if this needs to be further investigated.  Patient had 2 head CT scans, showing no intracranial abnormalities and MRI was unable to be completed due to patient&#39;s size. Neurology states high probability of stroke within their consult note. Patient&#39;s risk factors for stroke include: uncontrolled hyperlipidemia (LDL 132 on Crestor 40 mg daily PTA), hypertension (as high as 182/92 mmHg in ED), physical inactivity (BMI 76 kg/m^2), and male. Low suspicion of CVST based on patient&#39;s platelet count of 212 on admission and no abnormality on head CT. MRI would have been beneficial in potentially diagnosing CVST, as well.   Our recommendation is to submit this information to the VAERS database as a possible ADR from the vaccine. The patient fits the timing of an ADR, within 6-13 days of vaccine administration, and CDC recommends watching for neurological symptoms based on their most recent press release.

                                                I got the J&amp;J one shot and 12 hours later took myself to ER when BP hit 180/96. It went down in about 4 hours  to 150/83 without treatment and all blood work etc was normal range. I was dismissed. My BP is normally in the 120-130/80 range and has since returned to this.  I report this because I saw a comment in the newspaper by someone who said their 86 year old father had a HI BP episode after the shot that landed him in hospital and required treatment. That&#39;s two then, so I thought it best to report it in case there are more.

                                                Patient presented to the ED on 6/7/21 with abdominal pain that had started earlier that day. CT abdomen, CXR, and urinalysis were done and all came back negative. Patient denied any respiratory symptoms. On physical exam, he was found to have severe swelling, erythema,  and ecchymosis on his left leg extending into the upper thigh and knee. A lower extremity doppler was done and found extensive occlusive thrombosis within the left lower extremity beginning in the external iliac vein and extending into the common femoral, femoral, profunda, popliteal and visualized deep calf veins.  No evidence of PE or DVT in the RLE was found. Vascular Surgery was consulted, who did not recommend any procedures, but patient was started on a heparin drip. Hematology later saw the patient and changed the heparin drip to rivaroxaban on 6/9/21. Infectious Diseases was also consulted for possible sepsis.

                                                My father received his shot on March 13, 2021.  He drove to move home and on March 28th started having his right arm go numb but did not tell us.  He asked to go the ER March 29th at 6:45am saying his chest hurt and was having a hard time breathing, this has happened before since having Covid in September.  I called 911 after he became dizzy and could not walk.  While at the ER suffered a massive stroke that paralyzed him from his nose down over a course of 3 days.  His brain stem was affected and he lost the ability to swallow.  After being on a ventilator for 72 hours he was removed from it and died less then 30 mins later from drowning in his own saliva on April 1, 2021.

On Tuesday, March 16, I had a mild ache around injection site with no further symptoms until Saturday, March 27 when I experienced a brief episode of lightheadedness. (CONTINUED BELOW)

                                                13th of April. I had a blood clot in my hand. My index finger on  my left hand was numb and black and blue all around the knuckle area and into my hand area. I went to my primary care - I went to the acute center there. She said the hand was cold and could see the black and blue. They put me on Plavix for 30 days and I haven&#39;t had any reoccurrence of that. I think it was the 21st, I couldn&#39;t sleep all night, I had a kidney stone - the pain was so bad I got nauseous - around my back and side and in my front. I didn&#39;t have a fever. I went to the doctor office and they checked urine - and said there was blood in the urine. I was prescribed - Tamsulosin HCL. They thought I had passed most of it by the time I got there.

Patient advised me that he needed to go to the hospital because he was not feeling well and his oxygen level was low.   We called 911 and was taken to the hospital.  After at the hospital I advised a male nurse  that I was concerned about his leg being swollen cause he had been given the Jansen Covid vaccine and I was concerned about blood clots.   Everyday I would tell someone in the hospital (never saw a doctor I could talk to) about his swollen leg but did not really get anyone interested. Before he was moved to a Veteran?s State Home, I overheard someone saying they were going to give him his anticoagulant.  I?m filing this  report in case the swollen leg was a result of blood clots due to the vaccine.

There was an associated increase in pain in the knee.  I tried to shake it off hoping that the swelling and pain would go away, but I finally relented to the concerns of my family and sought care on the 6th of April at the emergency room because my doctor refused an in-person appointment.  The emergency room physician prescribed Eliquis which I have been taking.  The swelling seems to have leveled off, but my right leg still appears to be twice the size of my left leg

Over several days, this pain began to radiate and involve muscle and bone aches. He continued to feel ill to what he described as the worst symptoms on Monday, April 26th, which included severe pain, high blood pressure (211/113 documented by the ER), symptoms similar to cardiac event. The patient was seen by Emergency Department who did not find a diagnosis, but gave the patient medication to lower blood pressure and referred further treatment to his Primary Care Provider.  Blood pressure mediation was taken to lower his blood pressure and clonidine 0.1mg was prescribed by his PCP because of elevated BP (over 150/90). The patient was also instructed to take Advil for pain and was referred to get an X-ray  with follow up in 2 weeks on 5/13.
