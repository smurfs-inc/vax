The next day I was very weak and tired. The chills and fever faded the next afternoon.

                                                Approximately seven minutes after the patient received the Janssen COVID vaccine, he had called out to his wife/pharmacy technician at the pharmacy stating he did not feel well.  His head had fallen back and his eyes were starting to roll back into his head. Patient had saliva starting to foam at the corner of his mouth and it appeared to be the onset of a mild seizure (per wife, patient has had seizure once before after a head injury) and he was turning very pale. Patient seemed to be unresponsive at that time - not answering to questions. At this point, one of the pharmacists ran to the clinic to get help and the other pharmacist administered an Epi-pen to patient&#39;s thigh.  Patient immediately came around after the injection, looked up and began talking. Staff called 911 and patient was monitored by pharmacy and clinic staff.  When the paramedics arrived, the patient was doing better and was able to ride home with his wife.

At about 10:30pm I started feeling sick, fever of 99.6, muscle and joint pain, chills, dizziness, weakness. Left arm where I got injected also felt like it was falling asleep at some point when it shouldn&#39;t have been based on how I was positioned. I finally took an ibuprofen so I could sleep around 2:30am, and felt better a couple hours later or so. Today so far I feel fine but my resting heart rate is about 30 beats higher than normal so I&#39;m still responding to vaccine.  I think overall my symptoms aren&#39;t out of the ordinary, just way stronger than I was expecting. I felt miserable.

The last time I experienced symptoms like this was on the first day I started chemotherapy and had an allergic reaction to one of the chemo drugs (bleomycin). I had a delayed reaction hours later and went to the ER. It was determined it was an allergy. So I took Claritin D 24 H and saw the symptoms I was experiencing last night dissipate.

He came up shortly after (less than 5 mins post imz) saying he didn&#39;t feel well, like he was going to pass out. I immediately came from the pharmacy, my tech sat a chair behind him. I called for optical to call a code white. The patient requested to sit on the ground. At this point, his wife was present. He was sweating. I gave him an ice pack, a water after it was determined he was breathing okay. He was pale, extremely lethargic and sweating. After sitting him on floor I told my tech to call 911. I took his blood pressure, it was 99/73, pulse 75. Very low for him. Hes on blood pressure medicine but been having issues controlling it. He later tells me hes terrified of needles. He also tells his wife he hadn&#39;t eaten all day. I stayed with the patient until ems left with him because when standing his heart rate dropped 20 points, after they stuck him again to check his blood sugar. They determined then he should be checked out at the hospital and they took him.

By 9 pm I was alternating between hot and cold sweats.  By 10 pm I was vomiting and defeating uncontrollably while still alternating between hot and cold sweats. I dry heaved until around 3 am and then finally passed out. My fever never exceeded right about 100 degrees. For the next 2 days I was incredibly exhausted with muscle aches and a minor headache. I didn?t return to baseline for approximately 6 days after the shot.

These subsided, and I developed a cough for the next 3 or 4 days. This developed into more of a chesty feeling and lethargic feeling. On the 8th day after my vaccine, my symptoms were similar to those in Covid positive cases; chest tightness, dry cough, and chills. I went to get tested, and was found to be Covid-19 positive. Since then, I have experienced severe headaches, continued tight chest, cough, chills, and sweats.

The evening after the injection, a slight fever returned and then stopped.  Two days after the injection, there were no further averse reactions other than slight soreness in the injection site.

                                                On March 15 my blood pressure spiked even taking my medication. My BP was out of control even with medication. I contacted my Dr. asked me to double my high blood pressure medication and has worked since. I do have a follow up appointment with her. Prior to the vaccine I was taking one BP pill with no issues for 8 years.

Paramedics arrived and patient said he felt fine at that point but he would still go to hospital to get checked out.

Within about 5-10 minutes his girlfriend comes to the pharmacy window and tells me he&#39;s feeling bad.  By the time I get to his chair he is very lethargic and slumped over.  I sit him up in the chair and his head rolls back and his eyes have rolled back in his head.   I place him on the floor and instructed my staff to call 911.   The patient presented with sweats and was unresponsive for about 10-20 seconds.   When he came to he asked how he got on the floor.   The patient never had any trouble breathing  heart rate was steady the entire time.   When EMS arrived they checked him out and was fine.  He refused transport to the hospital.  He walked out of the store after about 30 minutes from the point of his passing out.

They finally decided it was an allergic reaction. Gave a steroid shot and Benadryl. Sent home on steroids for 5 days. The next day had rash and itching. The next day it was worse looked like lace pattern rash over most of his body and really bad itching. Like this through the 20th then he took Claritin and put on anti -itch cream. The next  day the rash had mostly cleared but still a little itchy. Today the 22 I have had a really bad headache.

My wife had to drive me home.

My body was cold. I had a pretty severe headache as well.  My body ached all over. Muscle and joint pain. I took Tylenol, but it didn&#39;t seem to do much. I spent all day Saturday in bed or on the couch. I ran a fever of 100.9 to 101.6 all day Saturday. My body ached making it hard to go up or down stairs. I was weak feeling and I was exhausted just going to refrigerator to get juice or water. Not much of an appetite all day. Also, arm was sore and bruised at the shot location. That was the least of my issues. Today is Sunday and I am feeling better now. I feel like the worst is absolutely behind me, but I felt so terrible yesterday, I thought I should report my issues.

                                                He began getting dizzy immediately after vaccine - pale, sweating, and felt like he was going to vomit.  He remained in the IMZ room for observation and applied a cool compress to forehead and back of neck.  Coloring came back after about 10-15 minutes and he said he felt better.  Also mentioned that this happened to him after he got a TDap vaccine about 15 years ago - he said it is a mental thing with him and does not like to get vaccines.

                                                Heart attack after J&amp;J vaccine -   My husband, complained of on and off chest/lung discomfort after two days getting the vaccine. This continued for about 3-3.5 weeks. On the night of Apr 16, he went to bed early not feeling well. Next morning he complained of heaviness in the chest area. We immediately consulted Dr., and mentioned that he got the vaccine. Dr. advised us to immediately go to an Emergency Room. Patient was found to be having a heart attack. His right artery was 100% blocked. The 3 left arteries had no blockage at all. Angioplasty was done and he had a stent placed in right artery. The clot was removed as part of angioplasty. He now needs to be on blood thinners for life.

The EMTs arrived and were able to revive him in the ambulance. When they reached the hospital he was put on life support.  After he coded again in the Emergency room they told me he was without oxygen for too long and was taken off the respirator. He passed away at 4:10 PM.

                                                Day 1: Saturday morning March 6 at 5:00am I was shaken out of my sleep with a nasty migraine, sour stomach, intense body aches, stuffy nose, fever (102f). Classic flu like symptoms. I was extremely sick all day Saturday (level of sick: 8/10). Day 2: Sunday morning March 7 I awoke again extremely sick, just as sick as Saturday. All same symptoms (level of sick: 7/10). Sunday night I was incredibly miserable, all flu symptoms, I did not sleep Sunday night, up all night and up all day the next day Monday. Day 3: Monday I continued to be sick, all same symptoms, all day long. This time the blood shot eyes &amp; bloody nose came on, fever was steady at 101f (level of sick: 6/10). Day 4: Tuesday woke up still stick, same flu like symptoms. I feel the headache has gotten worse, in fact way worse. Fever steady at 101f all day. Overall I&#39;m not as sick except the headache and fever (level of sick: 6/10).  Day 5: Wednesday I was really hoping I&#39;d make a full recovery but still still sick, fever dropped for a few hours then came back, fever peaks and bounces around at 101f. Headache is absolutely nasty, I feel intense pain in the back of my neck and head, hard to sleep or lay down. (level of sick: 5/10). Day 6: Thursday I feel like I&#39;m just about kick this sickness, feeling way better. I dont have a fever today but I still have an incredibly nasty headache, really intense, my eyes hurt, back of my neck hurts. (level of sick: 3/10). Day 7: Friday, no flu symptoms, finally!! But the headache continues, really bad. It sort of disables my ability to function with the headache. Back of my neck and back of head hurts, inside my brain hurts. Ugh! Day 8: Saturday, no flu, no fever, although still bad headache. I&#39;ve been taking Advil all week to help reduce the headache. It helps, but after about 6 hours later the headache returns. Late in the evening Saturday my head was pounding. Day 9: Sunday headache not that bad, mild headache lingered throughout the day, tolerable. Day 10: Monday no headache!! Today was the first full day of full happiness!! *NOTE*: In July 2020 I got COVID extremely bad, spent 4 days in the ICU, couldnt breathe!! I had a fever of 103 for 6 days straight before calling 911 to come and get me. I was in bad shape, lost 30 lbs, had respiratory breathing issue for about 2 months after hospital stay. Most sick I&#39;ve ever been, total game changer, I will never be the same. To this day I feel my respiratory is at 90%, fatigue still comes around every so often. --- Thank you ---

                                                Day 1: Saturday morning March 6 at 5:00am I was shaken out of my sleep with a nasty migraine, sour stomach, intense body aches, stuffy nose, fever (102f). Classic flu like symptoms. I was extremely sick all day Saturday (level of sick: 8/10). Day 2: Sunday morning March 7 I awoke again extremely sick, just as sick as Saturday. All same symptoms (level of sick: 7/10). Sunday night I was incredibly miserable, all flu symptoms, I did not sleep Sunday night, up all night and up all day the next day Monday. Day 3: Monday I continued to be sick, all same symptoms, all day long. This time the blood shot eyes &amp; bloody nose came on, fever was steady at 101f (level of sick: 6/10). Day 4: Tuesday woke up still stick, same flu like symptoms. I feel the headache has gotten worse, in fact way worse. Fever steady at 101f all day. Overall I&#39;m not as sick except the headache and fever (level of sick: 6/10).  Day 5: Wednesday I was really hoping I&#39;d make a full recovery but still still sick, fever dropped for a few hours then came back, fever peaks and bounces around at 101f. Headache is absolutely nasty, I feel intense pain in the back of my neck and head, hard to sleep or lay down. (level of sick: 5/10). Day 6: Thursday I feel like I&#39;m just about kick this sickness, feeling way better. I dont have a fever today but I still have an incredibly nasty headache, really intense, my eyes hurt, back of my neck hurts. (level of sick: 3/10). Day 7: Friday, no flu symptoms, finally!! But the headache continues, really bad. It sort of disables my ability to function with the headache. Back of my neck and back of head hurts, inside my brain hurts. Ugh! Day 8: Saturday, no flu, no fever, although still bad headache. I&#39;ve been taking Advil all week to help reduce the headache. It helps, but after about 6 hours later the headache returns. Late in the evening Saturday my head was pounding. Day 9: Sunday headache not that bad, mild headache lingered throughout the day, tolerable. Day 10: Monday no headache!! Today was the first full day of full happiness!! *NOTE*: In July 2020 I got COVID extremely bad, spent 4 days in the ICU, couldnt breathe!! I had a fever of 103 for 6 days straight before calling 911 to come and get me. I was in bad shape, lost 30 lbs, had respiratory breathing issue for about 2 months after hospital stay. Most sick I&#39;ve ever been, total game changer, I will never be the same. To this day I feel my respiratory is at 90%, fatigue still comes around every so often.

His headache was getting worse.  All symptoms were getting better except the headache.  He thought he was feeling better but when he woke up today 4/6/2021 he was SOB and diarrhea was back. Pt has taken Pepto Bismol for his symptoms and will probably need to go to the ER since he is having trouble breathing.   He feels like he has had such a bad reaction to this since he possibly has had the covid vax in the past 90 days.

I did not measure my body temperature because I immediately ran under the blanket. Icy-cold hands and feet, even after my body temperature seemed to stabilize. I fell asleep but not a restful sleep. I woke up after 2.5 to 3 hours with the feeling that it was morning, but in fact it was between 2am and 3 am. At that point I felt the worst part had gone, I felt weak and with muscle aches but I could drink water and go back to bed. I did not have a restful sleep all night and I woke up may times. By the morning I was tired but no fever.

Prior to that, I have been having some problems breathing after getting the vaccine and have been using my Ventolin  more often after the vaccine. Also noticed shortly after getting the vaccine, a feeling of liquid in my right ear.  the liquid in the ear did go away a day before the dizziness started.  Did not consider the ear or breathing issues as possible side effects  as I do have asthma and figured the ear was congestion. Not sure if the dizziness and the feeling of liquid in my right ear are related and/or related to the vaccine.

By second day I was recovered but sealing with injuries from the fall.

Then, after about 23 hours after the injection, bad headache (especially around the eyes - which also caused light sensitivity) and general malaise. Shortly thereafter, low-grade fever (99.5 F) and significant muscle pain, all over the body.  The most worrisome side effect was the last one, which appeared during the second night after the injection (about 32-33 hours after the injection): extremely fast heartbeat / racing heart.   I did not use any treatments for these side effects.

The next morning my joints ached and I had a sore throat.  I took a couple of Ibuprofen (200 mg each) and about an hour later, my aches started going away.  By 8 pm the next day, I didn&#39;t have many side effects.

About 1 hour later I started getting the cold chills, a headache and shaking.  About 1 more hour later I had a fever, achy joints and muscle aches.  The symptoms lasted through the night until about 8:30 the next morning when I started sweating.  I decided then to take aceteminiphen and Naproxen.  This helped me to feel a little better.  Side effects were resolved after 24 hours

                                                Patient had arm tingling shortly after injection. Pt stayed in store for about 4 hours after 2pm injection, no redness or swelling noticed. Pt was quite anxious &amp; nervous (but already has severe anxiety). Pharmacist called patient following afternoon, the 11th and patient noted he was doing marginally better but still sounded anxious. Pharmacist called patient on Fri the 12th 5:16p and this was when the patient explained the following: Muscle stiffness on left side &amp; pain down left leg; cranial pain; shoulder stiffness; nasal congestion; some shortness of breath; soreness &amp; fatigue.  Patient called back and said he had partial shortness of breath at 7:34p on the 12th.  On Sat the 13th at 11am, pharmacist called to check on pt; found him quite agitated &amp; saying, &#34;He feels the shot was botched&#34;, noted he had called Janssen to report his issues.  At 4:30pm, pt came to pharmacy, looked fine, arm showed no redness, was more subdued in person than on the phone earlier. He said he was feeling better but was not happy with Janssen and wanted the Moderna 2 series shot because he feels Janssen&#39;s vaccine wasn&#39;t doing what it was supposed to.

You should have a 24/7 hotline or something or add this to your possible side effects at least.

                                                I am diabetic and use a Medtronic Minimed insulin pump. Beginning approximately 4 hours after I received the vaccine my blood sugar increased to unacceptable levels. I immediately began taking extra boluses of insulin to bring my blood sugar back own to normal. I have a chart to use to guide the amount of extra bolus needed to bring blood sugars back down to normal. I followed that chart, which always works, but my blood sugars did not decrease as expected. As a result I took even more extra boluses which lowered my blood sugar nominally but not to normal levels. My blood sugars have continued to be high as of 42 hours after receiving the vaccination.

                                                Initial symptoms began with pain at the injection site and generalized fatigue.  This developed into soft tissue pain in proximity of the large and small joints which could be elicited further on palpation.  I had eye pain (left more severe than the right) which could be further elicited on palpation, headache, dizziness, chills, and an inability to feel warm.  There was also significant skin sensitivity over the trunk, scalp, and upper extremities and more in the left arm than the right.  The symptoms persisted over the second day albeit at less severity.  Presently on the third day, I am experiencing continued eye pain, mainly in the left eye and mild dizziness.

                                                Patient received vaccine approx  5-10 minutes patient fainted in his chair. A cardiac nurse was waiting to receive their vaccine and rushed over to help too. Patient began to convulse. We tried to get patient to respond approx 2 min later patient woke up and complained about being thirsty. We gave him Apple juice and placed a cold pack on his neck. Called 911, We took BP it was 77/49 pulse 45, we laid patient down and retook BP 123/73 Pulse 68. After 5 more min BP 135/85 pulse 72. EMS arrived and took patient away

                                                Patient was scheduled for an appointment for a Johnson &amp;Johnson  covid-19 vaccine through a drive thru Thursday April 8, 2021 @12:45pm. We arrived early and he received the vaccine at 12:15pm, waited 30 minutes for reaction and he was feeling fine. Later that same evening, the patient was driving to work on the freeway when he felt a dry throat so he coughed hard, at that cough he felt a massive pain in his head, like his &#34;head was going to explode.&#34; He immediately had tunnel vision closing in on him, so he pulled over and later woke up in our parked car with flashing emergency lights on, parked on the shoulder of the freeway. Disoriented and confused why he was there, he looked at his watch and saw he lost 15 minutes when he had passed out. MY HUSBAND COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED IF HE HAD NOT PULLED HIMSELF OVER WHEN PASSING OUT. Today we reported this to our doctors office and to you!

Also experienced some body aches.   Took my temperature via oral thermometer at 10:00 PM and it was 101.5.   Went to bed at approx 11:00 PM wearing all my clothes and under a quilt and two wool blankets.  Chills continued, but then I also began sweating profusely.   I did not rest well and was up approx every hour drinking water and urinating.  I noticed an elevated heart rate for several hours through the night.   cont&#39;d below

We requested him to stay in observation for 30 minutes after vaccine administration. He agreed and vaccine was administered. After working  approximately 3 hours later he returned to the pharmacy stating he felt out of breath. He didn&#39;t know if it was because of vaccine or CHF. Questioning him further, he said he felt a little swollen around neck. He was responsive. Administered 50mg of Benadryl. Instructed him to sit. He had a portable fan. After sitting down, he started to feel better. He remained at the pharmacy and called for transportation home, leaving approximately 1 hour later

This happened before 25 years ago and is likely unrelated to the vaccine. Expected cold/flu-like symptoms did occur on March 14 and part of March 15 but things have been fine since then. I&#39;ve followed up with my GCP and am scheduling a Neuro appointment for followup.

By 9a.m. my blood pressure taken at home was 180/110 and started having chest pain on left side.    Went to urgent care where they felt it was a cardiac reaction to vaccine and they sent me to ER.   Underwent EKG and chest xray.   Blood pressure still at same level 180/110 and not going down, migraine still at an 8 out of 10, chest pain still present.    I was given an IV to treat for migraine pain and within a few hours all symptoms had went away.   We started with Urgent Care at about 10a.m. on 4/3/21 and then by the time all was done I was released from the ER at 6:30p.m. on 4/3/21.

I figured that the pain would go away but the pain increased and my leg started swelling and the pain increased making it very difficult for me to put my leg down on the ground and put pressure on my right leg.

                                                I suffered two heart attacks. First heart attack was on the 6th day after the vaccine, second heart attack was on the 9th day of vaccine. Both heart attacks woke me up from sleep. I went to the emergency room and was hospitalized each time. I suffered chest pain prior to each heart attack but have never suffered chest pain before. I am continuing to suffer from periods of chest pain at rest.

About 10 hours later I started feeling sick.  One of the first things I noticed besides a headache was my heart rate jumped up to over 100 beats per minute (it is normally below 84).  I started getting chills and fever.  It was worse than any flu fever I ever had and I could not sleep.  Worst part was my heart rate would not go down, remaining above 100 but below 110-115 beats per minute.  I considered calling 911 but after looking online decided not to as long as it remained below 120 bpm.  I don&#39;t know my maximum temperature - I did not think to take it until after the peak had passed by 20 minutes or so (was 99.4 at that point - normal temperature runs 97.2 (low 96.8, high 98.2)).  Heart rate finally started to drop around 3:30 am.

Still freezing and body aches. Put on sweatpants and long sleeve t-shirt. Now have A/C off and windows open, 82 degrees outside. My temp taken before I started this form was at 98.7. I ache all over and am freezing. Not shivering though. But have goosebumps on arms under sleeves. I am very uncomfortable. It is now 10:35pm.

He said he was dizzy. He was at this point dizzy, pale, sweating, low heart rate in the 30&#39;s. We put a cold wet rag on the back of his neck and monitored. We gave him some cold water also. Slowly over the next 5-10 minutes his stats got better, color returned, and was not sweating anymore. He did not feel dizzy anymore.  We monitored for an additional 30 minutes. Gave instructions. Sent home with spouse.

BP had gone down some, so they agreed to proceed. After dose, pt was dizzy, sweaty, unresponsive for a short time. Once he was more responsive, we helped him sit on the floor against the wall as he was quite dizzy. We called 911 and pt refused transport to hospital, but was evaluated.

                                                pt states he told them he was on blood thinner so they had him stay 30 minutes before leaving after taking the vax.  At this time he became nauseated.  He went home and  laid down and fell asleep.  When he woke up he called his PCP because he wasn&#39;t feeling well.  His heart rate was running from 80-90 and fluctuating like he was about to have a heart attack. He was told to call back if he wasn&#39;t feeling better.  On 4/9  his heart  was running about 90-115.  On 4/10 his heart was running from 139-142.  He called his doctors office and they told him to go to the ER.  He went to hospital.   He was given heart  EKG, labs  and IV.  He was given aspirin.  His INR was at 2.  His heart rate came down to 115.   His blood was low.  His DX was Sinus Tachycardia.  He was admitted to the Heart Floor.  He was treated for 2 days and released.  They told him they thought he was reacting to taking the vaccination and to FU w/ PCP.  He said his heart rate is fluctuating  and is currently at 101.  He doesn&#39;t see a Cardiologist since he cannot have open heart surgery due to his underlying health conditions.

                                                After the injection on Friday 03/12 at 1:50 PM at facility, I started to get a slight temperature, Along with chills as well. This continue throughout the weekend. I remained at home and did not have any energy to go out and be around people. The next day, I also got diarrhea and was very dehydrated.  Immediately, after I left the vaccine shot location, like within 5 minutes, I started to smell fish and my mouth tasted like salt for three days. I also had excruciating headaches that did not go away with advil. So I rested a  lot and had no real big appetite what so ever!.  Today, I am concerned that on my left side below my left clavicle, I feel a big bump what appears to be possibly a lymphatic swelling of node? I am concerned because I did not have this swelling before and do not know if it&#39;s a reaction to the vaccine.  Pls contact me via phone, this is urgent.  Thanks

SO MONITORED THE BLOOD PRESSURE, HIS WIFE GAVE HIM CRACKERS AND WATER, AND WE HELPED HIM LAY BACK. PT BLOOD PRESSURE DID RETURN TO NORMAL AFTER THAT AND WE CONTINUED TO MONITOR HIM FOR ABOUT A HOUR AND A HALF. PT APPARENTLY HAS THIS KIND OF REACTION AFTER EVERY VACCINE AND IS NOTHING SPECIFICALLY TO DO WITH THE COVID SHOT. HE WAS EVENETUALLY FEELING BETTER AND THEY REFUSED TO LET ME CALL AN AMBULANCE SO WE HELPED HIM TO HIS CAR IN A PUSH CART AND THEY LEFT.

                                                First 4 hours post injection no serious side effects, slight headache was settling in.  At approx. 8PM (7 hours after shot) I had fairly a severe reaction of horror for the next 16 hours - all night long.  Heart racing/energy beyond, deep chills and severe whole body shaking to the point of my back going out (dont&#39; have a bad back), fever, migraine headache so bad (i dont get headaches) and body aches from a horror movie.   I&#39;m a jock, run daily, healthy, no smoke, drink or drugs. This lasted all night long well into the morning. At 3Am i considered going to the ER, but didnt. By 2pm the following day most of it went away. Two days later (today) i am dizzy, heart feels fast or racing, naseuous earlier , and exhausted. I can deal with it now, but it&#39;s very uncomfortable. Frankly, I regret getting the vaccine, wish i had not.   I had covid last March, it was no big deal beyond what a flu would have done...with some shortness of breath on and off for a few months. The reaction to the vaccine is viccious compared to covid itself (for me, just my experience). Hope this all stops and goes away.   Thank you for your work!

                                                Approximately 4 minutes after the injection, while sitting down, I felt light headed, sweating, weak, face turned white. I was close to passing out but didn&#39;t. I requested attention after about 10 minutes. While being treated by medics they mentioned color had returned to my face. I felt better enough so I refused to go to hospital and was driven home. Later that morning, 03/08/2021 about 10 AM, I developed a fever and body aches with sharp pains thru out my body and joints. First temperature check was 100.5. My fever, pains/weakness increased thru out that day and overnight with chills. Highest temp check was 102.8 that evening prior to bedtime. I don&#39;t know if it could have been higher at some point overnight. It felt like I had a moderate to bad case of the FLU. The next morning, 03/09/2021 the fever broke down to about 101. By 03/11/2021, aside from a little residual weakness I felt more like myself. However, as of the writing of this report my temp seems to fluctuate between normal and 99.8. Will report this to my Doctor on next visit. Worth noting that I haven&#39;t had any Flu like symptoms to that degree in many years.

Heart rate over 100, maybe up to 120 my resting pulse is typically in the l 50s )Suspect fever at peak was over 104. Fever and elevated heart rate lasted for hours. . At 2:30 AM took 3 ibuprofen, returned to bed and drifted off. An hour or two later woke up completely drenched and dripping with sweat but no longer feverish. Drifted back to sleep. By 9 AM felt almost normal, but (not surprisingly) a bit wrung out.

Then, without warning, I passed out, while driving on the freeway. Fortunately, I did not hit anyone, or was hit by anyone, and must have bounced off guardrails after crossing traffic twice and going off the freeway into the middle of an off ramp, where I finally came to. I did not suffer any injuries in the accident.
