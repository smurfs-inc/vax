The next day I was very weak and tired. The chills and fever faded the next afternoon.

                                                Approximately seven minutes after the patient received the Janssen COVID vaccine, he had called out to his wife/pharmacy technician at the pharmacy stating he did not feel well.  His head had fallen back and his eyes were starting to roll back into his head. Patient had saliva starting to foam at the corner of his mouth and it appeared to be the onset of a mild seizure (per wife, patient has had seizure once before after a head injury) and he was turning very pale. Patient seemed to be unresponsive at that time - not answering to questions. At this point, one of the pharmacists ran to the clinic to get help and the other pharmacist administered an Epi-pen to patient&#39;s thigh.  Patient immediately came around after the injection, looked up and began talking. Staff called 911 and patient was monitored by pharmacy and clinic staff.  When the paramedics arrived, the patient was doing better and was able to ride home with his wife.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after the patient received his vaccination, he rested his head on the wall behind him in the chair he was being observed in and passed out and turned white. His wife began slapping his face and screaming his name and the observer called for me. I arrived within seconds and assisted his wife in moving him from the floor to the chair. Within seconds of getting his head to the ground safely, he came back to and was very sweaty, red in the face. He stayed on the ground laying down, and then sitting for approximately 25 minutes. During that time, he told us that he had previously passed out during 3 procedures done at doctors offices.  We got him an ice pack and a orange pop as he was complaining of being hot and having only eaten a granola bar all day. He was able to get up to a chair and sat there for an additional 5 minutes, before he was able to walk out on his own accord. I have spoken with the patient twice since, once last evening and once today and he reports he feels great now besides the expected body aches from the vaccination.

                                                Heart racing the next day after vaccination. I went for a walk in the park and i noticed my hear rate jumped up to 165bpm on my fitbit for a period of time even though i just began walking. I wasnt running or anything. I was foggy and very jittery. I also experienced the same symptoms today, 4.12.21 while also heading for a short walk. Im an athlete and in great shape and ive never had my heart jump to 165bpm just walking. That would happen normally after a sprint or long run, but not just walking.

Once on the freeway I felt dizzy.  This came on me very fast.  I thought I better get off at the next exit.. but instantly blacked out.  While unconscious I struck another vehicle going approximatley 65mph, rolled my vehicle on its side, skidded, then rolled back upright.  I awoke to my car spun sideways on the freeway, paramedics, and fire dept working the wreck from my window, and no recollection of what happend.  It felt instantaneous to me.    I ate a breakfast of granola, yoguirt.  I hydrated before the shot.  I even took extra Vitamin C.

He did have some bruising to his forehead from the airbag.  Patient denies feeling ill or lightheaded after receiving the vaccine and reports the syncopal event came on very suddenly.

Sonner I felt a slight headache and from time to time it intensified to become unsupportable. At that time though about a lack of oxygenation, because I wore mask for the whole time I was working. About 9:am when I drove to home, I saw everything foggy in front of me.  When I get home I took  some paracetamol and another painkiller, because at that time my entire body was so warm, and the headache was very bad. I slept for 5 hours, when I woke up I went to the mechanic to fix my car.  While I got back during the time I saw the same foggy vision.

                                                Unusual exhaustion within an hour of the vaccine.  Had to go to bed and slept into the evening developing a fever of 103, severe thirst and chills. The fever lasted until 10:00 a.m. the following day, but weakness, thirst, chills and body aches continued for 3 more days intermittently. I would feel like I could finally exercise and then be too weak and tired to go back to routine. My appetite declined for 4 to 5 days as food didn&#39;t taste appealing. On Thursday, April 8, I announced to my mom in the morning that I finally felt like I was back at almost 100% and later in the afternoon felt nauseous, incredible pain in my chest and had dry heaves. I finally vomited some and was once again overcome by a fever of 101 and all I could do was sleep from severe exhaustion. I am against medication, but finally agreed to taking ibuprofen and tums. After sleeping into the next day around noon, I finally was able to eat some breakfast but the pain in my chest continued and I could rid it for another day. I intermittently had to sleep and gave up my exercise routine until my body has had time to recuperate. I have not fully recovered, but my appetite is picking up. I still require more sleep than normal.

                                                Pain in chest and back began on Wednesday 4/14.  What started out feeling like an uncomfortable pulled muscle in my back/chest area on Wednesday escalated rapidly to very sharp stabbing pains in my chest and back by Thursday afternoon 4/15.  After discussing my symptoms with the office of my PCP Thursday afternoon, I was told to go to the Emergency Room for evaluation.  I checked into the ER at approx 6pm that Thursday evening on 4/15.  While there I underwent a blood test, EKG and a chest Xray.  Upon evaluating the results of each test the Dr on assignment stated that there were no problems with major organs but could not diagnose.    Small red marks began developing on the right side of my chest that same day and progressively expanded in quantity across the right side of my chest and back.  A follow-up visit with my PCP was completed on Tuesday 4/20 and the diagnosis of Shingles was confirmed.  Pain has not subsided and has only gotten worse as of 4/21.  Prescription treatments began the evening of 4/20.

                                                The evening of the vaccination I began experiencing tingling at the site of the shot, then this extended through the night to chest pains and tightness in the chest. That continued through the night and into the following day. The following day and  lasting until present (4/27/2021) I have continued to experience tingling at night, extending to my arm and fingers, random very sharp pains in my chest, and some feeling of strong heart throbbing. This subsides during the day-time (when I&#39;m upright versus lying down) but all of these symptoms return during the evening. These are all things I never experienced prior to the vaccine. Also, I have tested regularly for COVID-19 since my companyconducts covid-19 testing and I have not been infected with COVID-19 at any point during the past year. The continuation of these symptoms is concerning. There have been at least two instances where the sharp pains in my chest were much more intense than the other chest pains I have felt since the vaccine.

About 5-10 minutes after vaccination, patient passed out (fainted) while sitting down in a chair.  Moved patient on to floor lying down flat and observed him for a few seconds. Patient was un responsive and appeared to struggle to breath. Asked my staff to call 911 for emergency services, and to bring an Epipen  just in case, and started to perform CPR on the patient. The patient gained consciousness in about 15 chest compassions and became responsive. He answered the questions like  his name, where he lives etc. As the patient became conscious,  responsive and appeared to breath normally, I did NOT administer Epipen.  Kept patient in observation and kept him engaged in talking until EMS personnel have arrived. They checked his vitals and blood glucose. In the conversation with   EMS personnel, they said he is hypertensive and hyperglycemic.  Ems took him to the ambulance by walking him (stretcher wasn&#39;t necessary)

Also have horrible vertigo, feel like  I am spinning all the time and it has not gone away.  I also had SOB and my heart was pounding for one week. My PCP told me that I should wait it out that it was probably my body revolving against the vaccine and I was prescribed a medication for my headache and vertigo. My ear were also checked with an ENT and I have no inner ear problems. I can say that my symptoms came from the J&amp;J vaccine.

                                                April 17th, felt chest pain and fatigue and shortness of breath. After about two weeks of it, I went to ER on the 26th. I was diagnosed with blood clot on my heart.  I spent a week at the hospital Heparin blood thinners and antibiotics  - discharged on May 2, 2021. They sent me home with Warfarin regiment. I am still on that.  I still have some days where I&#39;m good but some days, I can barely stand and get out of bed due to short of breath, fatigue but not as much chest pain. I think the blood thinners are working. I just have to take it easy and make sure to have some calm days.  It  could take weeks to months to have the blood clot totally dissolve from the system.

The patient then completed his &#34;Patient Questionnaire and Consent Form.&#34;  The patient was administered his Janssen Covid-19 vaccine around 11:05am.  About 2 minutes after administration, the patient appeared pale and sliding out of his chair.  The pharmacy technician responded and held the patient under his arms.   The patient  convulsed and then became unconscious.  We called 911, checked the patient for breathing and responsiveness.  The patient didn&#39;t stop breathing and became conscious about 1 minute after losing consciousness.  We placed the patient on the floor and placed cold compresses under his neck and on his wrists.  EMTs arrived and evaluated the patient and made sure the patient was stable.  EMTs offered to take the patient to the hospital but the patient declined.

                                                Patient received COVID-19 vaccine. After approximately ten minutes of sitting in the waiting area, patient began feeling ill. As he was walking up to the drop-off window to tell staff how he was feeling, he fainted and hit the back of his head on the ground. Patient was unresponsive so 911 was called. Patient was extremely pale, hot, and clammy, but slowly started to regain responsiveness. Patient reported blacking out. While waiting for paramedics, two cold ice packs were applied to the patient&#39;s head and neck. Paramedics arrived and assessed the patient. They released him from their care as free to go. Patient sat down outside the pharmacy for approximately ten more minutes. Once he decided he was feeling better, he walked around outside the pharmacy until he felt okay to leave. Prior to leaving, patient reported he was feeling better and appeared to be in good spirits. He also reported having fasting labs drawn 45 minutes prior to receiving the vaccine, as well as low blood pressure at his doctor&#39;s office. He confirmed ability to drive. Patient left the pharmacy approximately 45 minutes after receiving the vaccine.

The patient had no concomitant medications.  On 11-MAY-2021, the patient experienced myocarditis. He visited emergency room and underwent computerized tomogram (CT scan) and electrocardiogram (EKG); the results came up as myocarditis. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from the events. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V1: This spontaneous report was received from a health care professional via VAERS (ID: 1395661) concerned a 40-year-old man (ethnicity unknown) who experienced myocarditis one day after vaccine. The patient had no medical history, no known allergies and no current illness at the time of vaccination. The patient had no concomitant medications.  On day 1, the patient experienced myocarditis. He visited emergency room and underwent computerized tomogram (CT scan) and electrocardiogram (EKG); the results came up as myocarditis. The patient recovered. Information is limited in this case, and the occurrence of myocarditis could represent background incidence of such events in the general population. However, a relationship with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine cannot be ruled out and thus the relationship is considered indeterminate. More information will be requested if contact information is available.

Roughly 5 minutes after administration of the vaccine, the lady who accompanied the patient got the attention of the pharmacist.  Pharmacist ran out to assess patient and saw that he seemed unresponsive. Pharmacist then called for an EPIPEN, but pt woke up before the EPIPEN was ready.  No EPIPEN was given.  We then monitored the patient&#39;s BP every 10 minutes or so. Pt stablized after roughly 45 minutes to an hour and then left the store.

At about 10:30pm I started feeling sick, fever of 99.6, muscle and joint pain, chills, dizziness, weakness. Left arm where I got injected also felt like it was falling asleep at some point when it shouldn&#39;t have been based on how I was positioned. I finally took an ibuprofen so I could sleep around 2:30am, and felt better a couple hours later or so. Today so far I feel fine but my resting heart rate is about 30 beats higher than normal so I&#39;m still responding to vaccine.  I think overall my symptoms aren&#39;t out of the ordinary, just way stronger than I was expecting. I felt miserable.

                                                I got the vaccine at about 12:55pm. About ten minutes after getting the vaccine, while sitting in a chair, I began to get tunnel vision and felt extremely tired. I broke out in a cold sweat all over my body. I began to lose my vision like I was fainting and I momentarily blacked out or dozed off, then came back awake. I started to get tunnel vision again for a minute, then it faded away. Then I continued sweating for a minute and then it faded away. After a couple minutes I felt fine again. I sat for another several minutes then left at 1:15 feeling ok with just a sore shoulder.

He turned pale and fell sideways off chair onto floor lowering himself with his knee. He did not bump his head, he was sweating profusely, but did not lose consciousness. I yelled to the tech to call 911. Patient was sitting on floor.  He said he did not eat much all day. He was alert and talking. He said he fainted when his wife had their baby. We gave his some orange juice. The paramedics arrived 8 minutes later and checked his vitals. In the meantime we called his wife. Paramedics checked his BP, glucose and questioned patient. Patient refuse to go with paramedics. Wife came and paramedics released him to her.

About five minutes in, another patient who received the vaccine together with patient told us the patient had fainted. Patient was slumped over to the side when I came to check on patient. I called the patient a few times and patient started to come to. I asked the patient how he was feeling and if he had any difficulty breathing to assess for anaphylactic shock. Patient was breathing normal, but was sweating and a bit confused. Patient reported feeling dizzy. I explained to patient that he fainted for a few minutes and instructed to sit as I did not feel comfortable having patient lay down in the state he was in. Patient was given water and a fan to help cool him down and legs elevated (patient reported feeling much better with the fan blowing on him). Patient sat at the pharmacy for over 30 minutes before heading to the bathroom. At this point, patient were no longer dizzy and I instructed him to get up slowly and assessed that patient was no longer dizzy before letting him go to the bathroom.

                                                Patient was feeling warm and light-headed at 15 minute mark, so we kept for further observation and gave water to hydrate. At about the 17 minute mark patiently suddenly fainted in his chair for 15-30 seconds. He then began to vomit and woke up in the process. Once he fully came back to, he said he felt remarkedly better and no longer felt light-headed or clammy. Following this episode he reported feeling back to normal and that he had just ate a large breakfast before coming in for the shot, but did not feel bad in any way anymore. We observed for another 30 minutes and patient showed no further sign of issues. He was released with his wife.

                                                Injection Friday.  No issues Friday, Saturday, or Sunday other than slight pain at the injection site and slight body aches on Sunday.  Monday morning at approximately 0230 i woke up to what i can only describe as lightning pains in my legs.  It was a very intense pain shooting from my upper thighs to my knees and slightly bending around to the top of my calves on the outside of the leg.  Monday all day i did not feel well.  Had a dull pain in center of chest, and my left arm from the shoulder blade to the elbow had what i can only describe as a slight warm sensation.  I was also very &#34;foggy&#34; and light headed.  On Tuesday the pain in my chest worsened.  My left arm kept going numb (and still does today 04.21.2021), my jaw hurt, i was light headed and again very foggy.  On Wednesday it was the same thing and I called the VA and they told me to come to the ER for evaluation.

After conferring with my primary care facility, it was recommended that I see an ophthalmologist. Confirmed that I had a Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) and recommended I meet with a retinal specialist.  Dr. confirmed the BRVO was caused by a blood clot and commenced treatment via eye injection.  I then met with my primary physician to discuss the situation.  He recommend further tests to determine whether I had other clotting.  In addition to blood work, he order MRIs of my brain, head and neck region and also recommended that I meet with a thrombosis specialist.  I met with a Dr. who ordered additional blood work for additional testing.  All tests performed to determine if I had additional clotting have come back negative.

Patient then got out of his chair to come tell the pharmacist (myself), during which time I witnessed him starting to sway and attempted to approach the patient. Before I could make it to the patient he passed out and fell to the floor, his bottom hit the floor first followed by his torso. I told the intern to call 911 and stayed with the patient. He never stop breathing and a pulse was always present. He attempted to get up moments after falling and I requested he stay on the ground. After a couple minutes he felt slightly better and I assisted him into a chair. At this point the paramedics arrived and took over patient care while I described

By day 13 I started to get intermittent headaches that are very sharp. I am still getting them after three weeks. I have tried muscle relaxants and anti-anxiety medicine but they did not help. At night I am able to sleep but, in the morning, when I get up, I get sharp pains that are like ice picks and last for 3-5 seconds. Some of the headaches are more electric and as the day goes on it gets worse. I have tried taking Magnesium and Vitamin B-Complex and the headaches have changed to where they are starting in the afternoon instead of the morning. The headaches are a seven on a scale of 1-10. Sometimes the headaches come with a low grade fever.

                                                I received the COVID Vaccine at 12:30 PM. My temperature had been increasing all afternoon along with my heart rate. At roughly 8:40 PM, my temperature increased dramatically to approximately 38.9C. This may have happened over a relatively short period of time, since it was 37.9 C at approximately 8:00 PM. My heart rate increased to 150 bpm and I became dizzy. After a minute, my heart rate decreased to roughly 115 bpm.  Unsure whether to call EMS or not, I called a friend, who is a Dr. at the local hospital (Dr. is a colleague we do research together.) Dr. was concerned but provided information on what to do and when to call EMS or be driven to the ER. I spent the rest of the evening with a pulse between 105 and 110 and my temperature hovered around 38.9C until at least 12:30 AM.   The next day, my heart rate had decreased to roughly 80 bpm and my temperature to approximately 37.8C. I spent most of Tuesday sleeping. Today (Wednesday May 12, 2021) my heart rate is down to roughly 76bpm. My temperature is holding around 37.2C.   I have reported this to the CDC through the COVID vaccine reporting app.   My resting pulse is usually 62 bpm with a waking pulse of 58-60. My normal temperature is 36.5-36.7C. I have a wellness exam schedule for Monday. Dr. is not my regular GP, but was available at a time when my regular doctor was not available.

                                                April 30th began to notice dull ache in calf.  At first assumed it was a muscle cramp.  The pain began to increase through the weekend and into the following week.  I went to urgent care on May 6th.  They sent me to the ER to get an ultra sound as their preliminary evaluation was that it could be a blood clot.  The ER ultrasound confirmed the presence of a superficial thrombosis in my left calf.  No blood work was performed.  I was told to take ibuprofen and use a heated compress and to wear compression stockings.  If the pain grew worse, I was to return to the ER.  I scheduled a follow-up with my Primary the next day.  Blood tests show all values to be in normal range.  I have no history of blood clots and perform cardiovascular exercise on a daily basis.

He was bleeding because he had hit his face and his lip was split and his tooth was chipped. He also continued to be very dizzy, was extremely pale, and was sweating profusely. The EMT arrived about 20 minutes later and took him to the emergency room.

A week later I experienced chest pain and was inpatient at the  Hospital  for 2 days.  In patient, I had a variety of tests performed, including angioplasty where no blockage was found.  EKG showed minor issue with ventricular palpitation.  I almost fainted during my stress test, and tests showed low platelette count to check for CVST (I have family history of CVST).   I am to see a neurocardiologist on June 16th for further investigation.

                                                Woke up on morning after shot with uncontrollable shaking. I ended up needing to lay under several blankets in order to feel warm and stop shaking. My temperature was normal and shaking was not due to a fever. The shaking stopped about 15 hours after I received the shot but then I continued to have a headache and extreme fatigue.  The following day (about 48 hours after injection)  I had an extremely high pulse.  I took both my blood pressure and was able to take an EKG using a EKG recorder.  Both devices came back that I was having an irregular heartbeat. I repeated both tests about a half dozen times and they kept coming up the same indicating an irregular heartbeat. I have never had an irregular heartbeat before in the past. Finally after a couple of hours my heart rate slowed and the irregular heartbeat went away. As of right now (6 days post injection) it has not come back.

The last time I experienced symptoms like this was on the first day I started chemotherapy and had an allergic reaction to one of the chemo drugs (bleomycin). I had a delayed reaction hours later and went to the ER. It was determined it was an allergy. So I took Claritin D 24 H and saw the symptoms I was experiencing last night dissipate.

He came up shortly after (less than 5 mins post imz) saying he didn&#39;t feel well, like he was going to pass out. I immediately came from the pharmacy, my tech sat a chair behind him. I called for optical to call a code white. The patient requested to sit on the ground. At this point, his wife was present. He was sweating. I gave him an ice pack, a water after it was determined he was breathing okay. He was pale, extremely lethargic and sweating. After sitting him on floor I told my tech to call 911. I took his blood pressure, it was 99/73, pulse 75. Very low for him. Hes on blood pressure medicine but been having issues controlling it. He later tells me hes terrified of needles. He also tells his wife he hadn&#39;t eaten all day. I stayed with the patient until ems left with him because when standing his heart rate dropped 20 points, after they stuck him again to check his blood sugar. They determined then he should be checked out at the hospital and they took him.

I dry heaved until around 3 am and then finally passed out. My fever never exceeded right about 100 degrees. For the next 2 days I was incredibly exhausted with muscle aches and a minor headache. I didn?t return to baseline for approximately 6 days after the shot.

                                                Started feeling dizzy and started to respond slowly to things and felt weak around 8pm. Shortly after these symptoms I begin to have uncontrollable chills followed by a fever and Nausea. The whole time starting around 8pm I had pretty bad muscle aches as well. I took a warm shower and bundled up the whole night because I had a fever, aches, chills, and nausea. It was impossible to sleep because of this and sometimes my heart was beating fast as well. The next morning I had a headache that would not go away until I took Tylenol. The whole next day I felt exhausted as well and very weak. I began to feel better on day 3 but still feel somewhat foggy from the shot. I would not recommend this vaccine to anyone and would never get it again and hopefully the foggy sensation goes away.

                                                11 days following the single shot I developed severe pain in my right calf muscle that felt like a charlie horse and on my leg from knee to my ankle felt a squeezing sensation like I was wearing a very tight sock that I couldn&#39;t take off.  After a few days the pain subsided and the similar pain began in my left leg however not as severe.  The pain would seemingly move around and come and go.  Some days it was so bad I couldn&#39;t walk or balance.  I believed I had a muscular issue.  I then began having swelling on the top of my left foot and around the ankle of my left foot.  After about a week, my right leg began to swell from the knee to ankle fairly significantly.  New veins appeared on the front of my right leg and other veins on the back of my right leg began to bulge.   Pain on both legs started to subside on the evening of 5/23, however swelling continued.   On the evening of 5/25 I was experiencing severe squeezing sensation and bulging veins in my right leg.

                                                In the beginning, my feet and hands had poor  circulation and became discolored, cold, and painful (like Reynaud&#39;s syndrome). I was able to get the circulation going by exercising. This lasted for a couple of weeks. I had cold sweats and chest discomfort, which I thought were symptoms of WPW. I went to the cardiologist. An EKG was done and I was put on a 2-week halter monitor. Everything checked out as not being a heart issue. Blood tests were done, and the results were normal. After the cold hands symptom, I developed palmar erythema. I also developed a lot of abdominal pain. I became really gassy, and my bowel movements became a light yellow. I had frequent urination. My weight dropped from 191 to 180, and I lost my appetite completely; the appetite loss happened for a week and a half. I had to force myself to eat. My hunger is now back, and I currently weigh 187. The gassiness, yellow stools, abdominal pains, and the frequent have all largely subsided. The stools are now a normal color. The palmar erythema is still present, though.

There was muscle soreness, fatigue, my pulse was above 80 all night and reached 100 during the peak of the fever.  By the next morning, the fever had dropped to 100, fatigue remained and a slight headache appeared.  The headache was gone by noon, the fatigue remained all day.  The evening after the injection, a slight fever returned and then stopped.  Two days after the injection, there were no further averse reactions other than slight soreness in the injection site.  I am no longer fatigued and feel fine.  Hope this information helps.

(4) Muscle aches 2 days (previously injured muscles/joints became very sore 1-2 day after injection [left hip, right foot, left quad, lower back] - believe tylenol reduced inflammation) --symptoms ended 3-4 days after injection; slight fatigue remains 7 days later.

Three days later around 6:25 am on April 15, 2020: I got out of bed, next moment I recall is of me on the floor. No memory of falling. I was shaking uncontrollably as if my body was getting many commands at the same time but I had no control over it. I could not call out for help. At one point I was biting my right  hand but could not make myself stop until my shaking stopped. Bite did not penetrate skin but I had visible bite mark on my hand.  I regained control suddenly and just got up slowly and shaken by the experience. Wife then drove me to the ER.  Been feeling pressure on my head.

The vaccine was admistered and the patient was asked to stay seated in the waiting area after the injection. After a few minutes the patient passed out while seated and was moved to being seated on the floor by staff. The patient was given water and his blood pressure was monitored periodically for the next hour before releasing the patient.

                                                I received the shot on 4/10. First 24 hours I had a slight fever and headache. Treated with Acetaninophhen. Since that time, I had relatively mild symptoms 4/11 - 4/13. Mostly fatigue.  On 4/14, I had a sudden increase in heart rate, dizziness, tingling sensation in all arms and legs and weakness in my limbs/grip. This prompted me to visit the ER. They ran numerous blood tests amd scans on me but found no abnormalities. Various unusual symptoms have continued to persist since 4/14.  For brief moments I feel fine.  At other times I have experience fatigue, diziness/vertigo, rapid heart rate, pins and needles feeling in my left hand and left leg.  Left leg numbness/tightness and heaviness. The fingers on my left hand sometimes move involuntarily.  And my anxiety has also gone up during this time. Tonight it has migratee to my left foot, where I have numbness in several of my toes.  I&#39;m looking for advice. Should I be concerned? Should these symptoms still be occurring 11 days after receiving my shot?  It has been very distressing and there seem to be very few people who have knowledge on this subject.  My care providers keep saying to self monitor and contact them if symptoms worsen. The problem is symptoms don&#39;t necessarily worsen, they just migrate from one area of my body to another.  The numbness comes and goes in maybe 1-2 hour intervals.

Currently on 30mg/day of XARELTO blood thinner (I&#39;ve been taking since diagnosis on 5/5/21).  Will continue to take 20mg/day for the next 30 days.  Background: I started to notice my right calf get tight and sore approximately ~3 weeks following my vaccination.  I had been doing a lot of running and hill training so I assumed it was a muscle strain/aggravation.  After approximately 1-2 weeks I noticed the tightness worsen and also noticed significant swelling around my lower calf/ankle.  I went to the doctor on 5/4/21 and was given a D Dimer blood test which came back 1.27 mcg/mL FEU (over the recommended 0.5 mcg/mL).  The next day I had an ultrasound of my right leg where they discovered the SVT clot behind my right knee in a superficial vein (but near a major/deep vein intersection).  I was immediately prescribed XARELTO blood thinner - to be taken for ~51 days.  ~21 days of 30mg/day (15mg twice/day) followed by ~30 days of 20mg/day 1x per day.  The morning of 5/20/21 around 6:30am I started to feel nausea and vertigo after returning home from walking my dog.  I finished a low-intensity exercise routine at my home and around ~7:15am my symptoms worsened.  I went upstairs to my bedroom to lay down on my bed and the room started spinning.  I then went to the bathroom and vomited clear fluid.  I started feeling a little better after vomiting but was still slightly dizzy and light-headed.  I made an appointment and went to the doctor around 10:30am.  The doctor suggested doing further bloodwork and a CT scan of my head.  Both tests came back normal.  The doctor suggested the vertigo and nausea were inner ear related and that I should continue taking XARELTO and to also start wearing a compression sock (especially during exercise/activity).

Fortunately my wife was there, I called out to her because I was getting dizzy, she came over as I was passing out, I grabbed onto her and we both fell to the floor (I used her to cushion my fall). I passed out on her as she screamed for help. Two male customers assisted me into a chair as I was disoriented, my wife asked me what her name was and I didn&#39;t her name as I was pale, trembling, and sweating. The pharmacy tech thought I was going into convulsions and called 911. The paramedics arrived and fortunately I was breathing and slowly coming back. Paramedics remained there and took all my vital signs and stayed with me. Since my vitals were okay and my color came back, I felt much better and was coherent again. This event was at least 30-minutes or more. I declined going to the hospital with ambulance and the paramedics told me to call 911 if it happens again.

                                                Woke up the next morning feeling sore at shot site and as the day progressed my body started to ache all over.  For the next 2 days after this, I will alternate between having the chills and having intense sweats.  On Friday 06/25/2021, I woke up to my chest hurting , I could not catch my breath, it felt like I had a very heavy weight on my chest .  I went to the emergency room which is a part of the Hospital.  After the initial tests the  physician told me with 99% certainty that I had had a heart attack.  Soon after this they rushed me by ambulance from hospital to hospital which is about 20 miles or so.  They rushed me in and completed an arteriogram within minutes of arriving at the hospital.  They confirmed with this test that is was not a heart attack and after several more test, the doctor that I had developed Myocarditis due to the vaccine shot.  The admitted me into the hospital on 06/25/2021 for observation and to run more test until I was stable enough to go home.  I stayed in the hospital for 1 evening and was discharged on 06/26/2021 at about 1:00 or 2:00 that afternoon.  The doctor prescribed several medications for me to take for my heart for the next foreseeable future.  On 06/30/2021 I had a visit to my new cardiologist in which he ran several test and stating that I was looking better, but he had ordered an MRI to take place on 07/06/2021 at Hospital.  I have a follow up visit for my cardiologist slated for 07/19/2021 in which I will find out more information.

Within about 5-10 minutes his girlfriend comes to the pharmacy window and tells me he&#39;s feeling bad.  By the time I get to his chair he is very lethargic and slumped over.  I sit him up in the chair and his head rolls back and his eyes have rolled back in his head.   I place him on the floor and instructed my staff to call 911.   The patient presented with sweats and was unresponsive for about 10-20 seconds.   When he came to he asked how he got on the floor.   The patient never had any trouble breathing  heart rate was steady the entire time.   When EMS arrived they checked him out and was fine.  He refused transport to the hospital.  He walked out of the store after about 30 minutes from the point of his passing out.

Immediately sat back down to place my head between my knees, and completely blacked out, fallout out of the chair and hitting my head and knee on the floor and  nearby fixtures. Regained consciousness on floor about 30 seconds after fainting and immediately felt much better.

Vital signs normal including BP 120/90, 100% o2 levels, normal blood sugar and EKG. EMS assisted in getting me back to seated position and monitored for another 10-15 minutes. Declined transport and had family member drive me home where I rested for a few hours and woke up feeling fine. Very minor bruising / bump on head with no lasting sign of concussion or other trauma. 24&#43; hours post vaccine no other notable vaccine reactions aside from sore arm / muscles on injection site.

                                                I felt fine all day and went to bed at 9:30pm. I woke up to my body shaking uncontrollably and I was freezing at 10:30pm. My wife felt my skin and she said I was burning up. Unfortunately our thermometer wasn&#39;t working so I don&#39;t know my temperature, but I have never in my life shaken so badly with a fever. I couldn&#39;t control myself and I was shaking so hard that my muscles were sore from it, but I still couldn&#39;t stop. I then began vomiting every 45 minutes or so. This happened for nearly 4 hours until 2:18am. Then very suddenly everything just stopped. No more feeling cold (actually I then felt very warm and couldn&#39;t cool off. I was sweating quite a bit). No more shaking. No more vomiting. I did get a wicked headache, but I figured it was due to dehydration and took two Advil. The Advil didn&#39;t do anything and I was awake until 5:59am because my head hurt too badly to sleep. Finally I slept for about 4.5 hours. Then I just felt worn out for most of the day on the 10th, and couldn&#39;t shake the headache. Then on the evening if the 10th, I started getting a sore throat and a slightly runny nose. I went to bed that way. When I woke up on the 11th (today) I still had the sore throat and slight runny nose. The headache was gone, but I felt tightness in my chest. As I went throughout the day, I&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;m short of breath with doing most things. I have two young children, so even taking care of them I feel like at times I&#39;m struggling for breath. I&#39;m not in bad shape and am a runner, so my cardio isn&#39;t bad. So I was surprised by this.

                                                Got COVID (Janssen) vaccine shot on April 6th at noon.  Felt fine Tuesday and went to bed as normal.  Woke up April 7th at 7AM with sharp pains in my left shoulder (same side as shot) and slight shortness of breath, and slight chest pain in the left quadrant of my torso (same side as shot).  Proceeded to take Advil and seemed to help a bit.  Minor aches/pains and shortness of breath throughout the day until about 8PM.  At this time shoulder chest pain became more severe, and breathing became very strained, short, and painful.  Pain and breathing kept getting worse and at midnight on Wednesday night thought I was having a heart attack due to extreme chest pain, couldn&#39;t breath, lightheaded, dizzy, tingly extremities.  My wife drove me to ER at 12:30 AM Thursday.

At the time of arrival to the medical clinic, he had refractory nausea and vomiting after receiving Zofran earlier in the day at another clinical site. Medical treatment consisted of IV Fluid bolus with maintenance fluids, IV Phenergan for the nausea and vomiting, and IV Ketorolac for headache pain. His  symptoms resolved and he started to feel better so a clinical decision was made to discharge him home in the care of a close friend. He declined any other treatment modalities or medications at the time of the discharge.  The patient returned on 03/28/2021 with a right arm DVT proven on U/S. He was then started on anticoagulation therapy after specialist phone consult and will be closely followed.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: Unknown) frequency 1 total, dose was not reported, administered to left arm on 06-APR-2021 at 12 noon for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 6-APR-2021 at 12 noon, patient got vaccinated and was fine that day . Next morning on 07-APR-2021,  patient woke up with sever cramping in same shoulder which he got the shot in, most pain was in the upper left quarter of his torso to down half way to chest up to the shoulder till the neck .

He took Advil and went along with his day . He took 3 tablet of Advil 200mg  every 4-5 hours all day ( total of 3 dose that day) . By night time the case was progressively worse as the whole chest had a lot of pain . He thought that he had heart attack . He thought that he was about to  pass out . He could not stand on his own . So his wife took him to emergency room at mid night at 12:30 am on 08-APR-2021. He stayed there for 5 hours and they did  bunch of tests , EKG which rolled out the heart attack .They did  Chest X-ray which found things then did D-dimer which its level was very high . They found  bunch of clots in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides. They did ultra sound on the legs  which had no evidence of blood clots . They discharged him  from the emergency room as  they felt that he was ok to be out . After couple of hours after discharge , patient&#39;s health care professional wrote for him Eliquis, antibiotic and pain reliver. He was given antibiotic because he had  beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed) . It was found air sacs in lung with signs of pneumonia in both lobes . He came home and started to  monitor his blood oxygen . He stayed in the  same position till recovery . He was better each day since last week but still had sinus and cramping in the chest ( very minor but was still there). The lung capacity was very limited to take some steps. Patient stated that he needed a specialist to understand his condition. He had no medical history before that incidence . He was wondering regarding which type of blood thinner was good for this type of blood clots because he read that the regular blood thinners are not good for that type of blood clot which his HCP gave (regular blood thinner). Laboratory data included: Total lung capacity decreased (NR: not provided) lung capacity is very limited. On 08-APR-2021, Laboratory data included: Chest X-ray (NR: not provided) found things, EKG (NR: not provided) rolled out heart attack, Fibrin D dimer (NR: not provided) level was very high, and Ultrasound scan (NR: not provided) no evidence of blood clots.  Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included: apixaban, and ibuprofen. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of the severe cramping in left shoulder and upper body, chest pain (whole chest had lot of pain)/thought that he had heart attack, shortness of breath/could not breath, thought that he was about to pass out, difficulty in standing, bunch of clots in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides, beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed), cramping in chest and sinus was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments:  This 44-year-old male patient reported blood clots of both lungs 2 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  The patient denies any medical history/condition prior to vaccination.  The symptoms reported were severe cramping of arm that spread to his whole chest and upper body and shortness of breath; the patient thought he had a heart attack, about to pass out and could not stand because of the progression of pain.  EKG done at the emergency room ruled out heat attack, D-Dimer was reported to be very high, clots were found in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides, x-ray showed beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed).  The patient was prescribed with Eliquis, an unspecified antibiotic and pain reliever.  Outcome of the events were not reported.   Based on the information that is available, the event is assessed as plausible with the causal association to immunization, per WHO causality classification of adverse events following immunization based on a lack of a definitive plausible biological mechanism.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

They finally decided it was an allergic reaction. Gave a steroid shot and Benadryl. Sent home on steroids for 5 days. The next day had rash and itching. The next day it was worse looked like lace pattern rash over most of his body and really bad itching. Like this through the 20th then he took Claritin and put on anti -itch cream. The next  day the rash had mostly cleared but still a little itchy. Today the 22 I have had a really bad headache.

                                                Pt. received the vaccine at approximately 2:44pm.  Before I could hand him his card, his hands began trembling and he looked pale.  I asked how he was feeling.  He reported feeling shaky, dizzy, and very hot.  I asked him if he was having any difficulty breathing, had tightness in his throat/airways, or even felt a tingle.  He said no.  Noting the time, I asked if he had eaten lunch.  I asked if he has ever felt this way before.  He said he had when he gets a &#34;hypoglycemic attack.&#34;  While not diabetic nor on any medications, he said he will occasionally get very low blood sugar.  He said he had not eaten since early that morning.  Another employee brought some juice I requested.  I again asked him about symptoms related to anaphylaxis, to which was not an indication of an anaphylactic reaction.  I gave him the juice to sip.  I asked him again about symptoms.  Because he was still dizzy, I took his blood pressure/heart rate.  His BP was 160/119 and heart rate 96bpm.  His color became more gray over the next several minutes.  He was still too dizzy to stand, felt hot, shaky, and now nauseous.  He handed over the juice and was given a receptacle if he vomited.  We suspected a vasovagal response, but was still symptomatic after 10 minutes. Meanwhile, the other pharmacist tried to call his doctor&#39;s office.  We learned his doctor had moved away and he had not yet come in nor selected a new provider.   We asked him if he felt he needed to be seen by a doctor.  He said he did and agreed to us calling an ambulance.   The ambulance arrived around 3:10.  The EMTs took his BP.  It had come down, but he could not stand up without his knees buckling.  The EMTs got him on the stretcher and took him to the hospital.

                                                5 minutes after receiving the injection, my husband passed out, starting sweating profusely, and was out cold for a minute. EMS were called and he was seen in ER due to low heart rate and sweating to rule out any heart conditions. He had 2 EKGs - one in the ambulance and one in the ER. He also had to have a CT for falling and bumping his head to rule out that injury. The DX was listed as a vagal response, but we are not so sure we agree given that he is 45 years old, has no priory history or anxiety about shots.

TEE determined PFO. Heart monitor was placed to check for arrhythmia.  High cholesterol was noted and medication for that was given. I was also given blood thinners and aspirin.

                                                Patient does not remember most of the adverse event. Patient&#39;s partner reports that patient started feeling a tingling sensation on his left arm about 10 minutes after vaccination. Partner also reports that patient was hallucinating and sending her confusing text messages during his 15 minute observation period. The patient did not report feeling any adverse symptoms at the checkout station after his 15 minute observation period and before leaving the vaccination clinic.    After patient returned home, his partner reports considerable swelling on his left arm, continued hallucinations and trying to dismiss her concerns. Subsequently, that same day, partner reports the patient had a severe migrane and began to lose feeling on his left arm and leg, at which point the patient also lost consciousness.  Also at this point, the partner calls 911.   After arrival of emergency personnel, the patient regains consciousness, but does not remember name and complains of continued pain on his arm. He is transported to hospital where he spends 3 nights and receives treatment and care for stroke symptoms.    Patient reports that he does not remember much of anything 1.5 days after vaccination.   After returning home from hospital, patient complains of memory lapses and begins seeing neurologist for minor seizures during his sleep.   Wife reports that patient now lashes out and easily loses temper due to the fact that his memory is foggy.

                                                On March 13, I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine at the  clinic  The pharmacist monitored me for symptoms but there were none right away. I did have a fever and some body aches in the two or three days that followed but those were short-lived.  While driving on March 16, I started experiencing some irregular breathing and periods of shortness of breath about three hours after leaving home. I stopped at the emergency room at the Health Center where Dr diagnosed me with an acute pulmonary embolism after discovering a small blood clot in one of my lungs. He prescribed me with Eliquis, which I am still taking today. Their phone number is provided if you have questions.  I haven&#39;t had too many shortness of breath episodes lately but do not know if the blood clot is still there. I am scheduled to see my hematologist on April 27 to get further updates on this. My hematologist Dr is located in clinic number provided While it has not yet been proven that the vaccine caused the blood clot in my lung, I feel the need to report this in the wake of recent news about the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. My hematologist and primary care physician are both aware that I have received the vaccine but I have not received any further communication from them.

Patient found to have a Hunt Hess 3 Fisher Grade 3 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage with hydrocephalus s/p EVD,  s/p cerebral angiogram on 4/18 negative for aneurysm/AVM. On the evening of 4/20, patient became acutely hypoxic with wheezing for which he required oxygen via 10L oxymask. During 4/21, his oxygen requirements continued to increase with increased work of breathing requiring high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) at 50L/60%  &#43; pulmonary congestion on imaging and he was treated with diuresis. On 4/22, oxygen needs increased requiring 70L/100% with worsening imaging. He was then started on steroids, antibiotics were broadened, epoprostenal started in addition to diuresis. On 4/23, patient reports improved breathing and is on non-rebreather. Antibiotics, steroids, and epoprostenal were discontinued as patient showed improvement of oxygenation without clear signs of infection. Of note,  patient reports vaping in the past 2-3 months.  Patient has also been intermittently febrile. Wife was concerned that these symptoms were possibly related to him getting the J&amp;J vaccine on 4/11. Patient is currently still in hospital on day 6 of admission at this time.

                                                Before receiving the vaccination the patient mentioned he had a fear of needles.  Patient was asked if he ever fainted after getting a vaccination or injection and patient reported no.   The vaccine was administered to the patient and patient appeared to be fine for the next few minutes after getting vaccinated.  Patient was told he could take a seat in the waiting area and wait until his 15-minutes were up and he could go.  Patient was seated in the waiting area for about a minute but then got up to walk down one of the isles. When walking down the isle patient fainted and collapsed. This occurred approximately 10 minutes or so after he received the vaccine.  Patient was helped to a chair and once seated appeared to shake/convulse (almost like a seizure) for approximately 5-10 seconds before snapping out of it and regaining consciousness.  Afterwards he was alert and talking but didn&#39;t remember fainting.  911 was called and he was checked out by paramedics. After observing him for 15 minutes or so and determining his heartrate and blood pressure were normal and he appeared to be ok, the paramedics told him they can take him to the hospital to be evaluated further, or he was free to leave on his own without going to the hospital.  The patient said he felt fine and declined being taken to the hospital. After another 10-15 minutes the patient left under his own power. Patient mentioned he would possibly be calling his physician and alerting them to the episode.

I ran out once this was brought to my attention. I found him on floor, blood on the floor and he was shaking and then stop. I don&#39;t know how long he was shaking but it stop. I checked the pt and he regained conciousness. I asked if he is ok. He ask what happened because he does not remember. He speaks another language and an associate was there to translate. We asked if he wants us to call 911, he refused. The firefighter/paramedics suggested they will come over anyway to make sure he is ok, he does not have to go with them to go to the hospital. Pt did not want to go to hospital because he does not have insurance. He was checked by a medic who also speaks his language. He checked pt&#39;s vital signs, asked questions like allergies, medical conditions, asked what day is today and what is his name (which were the same questions I asked before medic arrived). Medic informed patient the importance of seeing to a dr, the sooner the better. Pt still does not want to be taken to the hospital. Patient  signed a refusal form. Nephew picked up the pt

                                                On 7/6/2021 while on vacation, I started developing sharp tingling feeling in my left leg. I then nearly had a syncopal episode, had trouble speaking and was leaning to the right. My wife had to hold me up. My brother in law had to carry me to the car as my left leg was not working at all. I was taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital and was worked up for possible CVA (which was ruled out). I was also checked for DVT of lower extremities which was negative. I am still having residual numbness and tingling to my left leg. I am still having symptomatic bradycardia with near syncope.

He remained in the IMZ room for observation and applied a cool compress to forehead and back of neck.  Coloring came back after about 10-15 minutes and he said he felt better.  Also mentioned that this happened to him after he got a TDap vaccine about 15 years ago - he said it is a mental thing with him and does not like to get vaccines.

Unusual for me hour long nosebleed resulting in use of a half of box of tissues. It occurred at 3am so doing anything other than homecare didnt seem necessary. After getting this vaccine I felt a brain fog for approx 15 days especially after being awake for about 8 hours, unusual for me as well. The nosebleed was of most concern and with the recent pause I saw on todays news about blood clotting issues. I felt it was important I report my experience on day 8 of vaccine and days 2 thru 15 of vaccine. I would not go back in time and take this vaccine based on my side effects.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I did not feel well within a minute or so of receiving the shot - not an allergic reaction per se. The nurses took my blood pressure and it was 200&#43;/100&#43; and HR was 108. They continued to monitor and it slowly went down over the course of the 45 minutes I was there. Upon departure, BP reading was at about 160/90. I monitored that evening and Sunday and was normal most of the time. I did have a similar feeling Sunday afternoon and Monday afternoon, and when I checked my BP it was about 150/90 and HR was elevated (between 100-115bpm). Eventually I felt better, excluding expected side effects I&#39;ve had - fever, aches, and fatigue. As of Tuesday (today as of writing), I am feeling better than yesterday, less fatigue and no fever thus far. I am hoping no more episodes with the elevated BP and HR occur today or in the near future. I did notify my physician about this and he asked me to monitor my BP for the next week, stay hydrated, and report back if no improvement in BP readings.

This continued for about 3-3.5 weeks. On the night of Apr 16, he went to bed early not feeling well. Next morning he complained of heaviness in the chest area. We immediately consulted Dr., and mentioned that he got the vaccine. Dr. advised us to immediately go to an Emergency Room. Patient was found to be having a heart attack. His right artery was 100% blocked. The 3 left arteries had no blockage at all. Angioplasty was done and he had a stent placed in right artery. The clot was removed as part of angioplasty. He now needs to be on blood thinners for life.

This was associated with headache, diaphoresis, shortness of breath, substernal chest discomfort, and sensation of throat itching. By 72 hours the bulla had popped and the patient&#39;s the only remaining symptom was right upper arm pain.

The EMTs arrived and were able to revive him in the ambulance. When they reached the hospital he was put on life support.  After he coded again in the Emergency room they told me he was without oxygen for too long and was taken off the respirator. He passed away at 4:10 PM.

                                                Since receiving the vaccine, I have developed tightness in my chest and shortness of breath.  At times, it has been severe.  Feeling like I might pass out, I went to Immediate Care on 04/12.  They didn?t identify a cause.  On 04/15, I went to my Doctor, who noted wheezing in my upper lungs.  An inhaler and pantoprazole were prescribed.  At times, it feels like I am having something similar to an asthma attack.  The inhaler has helped.  Prior to the vaccine, I didn?t have any history of breathing problems, nor does it run in my family.

This burst and was clearly filled with blood.  Over the ensuing 24 hours, he has had multiple such blisters and came to the Emergency Room for fear of a reaction to the COVID vaccine that he had had 13 days ago.  This was Johnson and Johnson.  He had no major reactions to it.  On coming to the Emergency Room today, he noticed significant petechiae forming over the lower extremities as well as scattered petechiae forming elsewhere.  He presented to the Emergency Room and there was noted to have a CBC showing hematocrit of 51, 4000 platelets, and a white count of 7.7 with an unremarkable differential.  INR is 1.1.  D-dimer was 0.33.  Chemistries were limited, but were within normal limits.

Then that day he started getting a headache, feverish, took Tylenol and felt better.  The next day he noticed his heart rate would not go down, it will not go down below 100, will shoot up to 130.  He went to the ER and at one point went to 150.  They prescribed him some medicine to lower his blood pressure and he has been taking that and it has not been helping.  He also went to his doctor and told him that it was probably anxiety, and his heart rate will still not go down.  He has not had any other reactions other than this and he&#39;s scared.

My blood pressure was elevated as well. And that was not going away either. I went to doctor. My headaches have decreased. But for the last two to three days I have been getting chest pains. I have called the doctor this morning and I&#39;m waiting to call me back.  It&#39;s not ongoing pain - just every now and then - I&#39;m not sure what it is.

When we went to assist him he asked to lay on the floor, before we could help him to this position he fainted, we got him on the floor and on his side, within about twenty seconds he woke up and was very aware of his situation. We applied ice packs under his neck and on his forehead.  After about twenty minutes he sat up and started to gain his color back.  At this point he told us he had fainted before after a flu shot and and donating blood.  Several minutes later he was able to stand up and sit in a chair.  Cold packs were continued and he drank a bottle of orange juice.  Twenty minutes later he said he was back to normal just felt weak like after a work out.

I left the hospital before someone would read my EKG because it was crowded and I was worried about infection. The symptoms persisted for approximately 6 to 8 hours and mostly coincided with fever and chills.   about a week or ten days later, I had another episode of strong heart beats lasting about 6 to 8 hours. I went to Hospital and was told I had premature atrial contractions.   my other symptom has been louder tinnitus, which has not subsided since my shot.

                                                Day 1: Saturday morning March 6 at 5:00am I was shaken out of my sleep with a nasty migraine, sour stomach, intense body aches, stuffy nose, fever (102f). Classic flu like symptoms. I was extremely sick all day Saturday (level of sick: 8/10). Day 2: Sunday morning March 7 I awoke again extremely sick, just as sick as Saturday. All same symptoms (level of sick: 7/10). Sunday night I was incredibly miserable, all flu symptoms, I did not sleep Sunday night, up all night and up all day the next day Monday. Day 3: Monday I continued to be sick, all same symptoms, all day long. This time the blood shot eyes &amp; bloody nose came on, fever was steady at 101f (level of sick: 6/10). Day 4: Tuesday woke up still stick, same flu like symptoms. I feel the headache has gotten worse, in fact way worse. Fever steady at 101f all day. Overall I&#39;m not as sick except the headache and fever (level of sick: 6/10).  Day 5: Wednesday I was really hoping I&#39;d make a full recovery but still still sick, fever dropped for a few hours then came back, fever peaks and bounces around at 101f. Headache is absolutely nasty, I feel intense pain in the back of my neck and head, hard to sleep or lay down. (level of sick: 5/10). Day 6: Thursday I feel like I&#39;m just about kick this sickness, feeling way better. I dont have a fever today but I still have an incredibly nasty headache, really intense, my eyes hurt, back of my neck hurts. (level of sick: 3/10). Day 7: Friday, no flu symptoms, finally!! But the headache continues, really bad. It sort of disables my ability to function with the headache. Back of my neck and back of head hurts, inside my brain hurts. Ugh! Day 8: Saturday, no flu, no fever, although still bad headache. I&#39;ve been taking Advil all week to help reduce the headache. It helps, but after about 6 hours later the headache returns. Late in the evening Saturday my head was pounding. Day 9: Sunday headache not that bad, mild headache lingered throughout the day, tolerable. Day 10: Monday no headache!! Today was the first full day of full happiness!! *NOTE*: In July 2020 I got COVID extremely bad, spent 4 days in the ICU, couldnt breathe!! I had a fever of 103 for 6 days straight before calling 911 to come and get me. I was in bad shape, lost 30 lbs, had respiratory breathing issue for about 2 months after hospital stay. Most sick I&#39;ve ever been, total game changer, I will never be the same. To this day I feel my respiratory is at 90%, fatigue still comes around every so often. --- Thank you ---

                                                Day 1: Saturday morning March 6 at 5:00am I was shaken out of my sleep with a nasty migraine, sour stomach, intense body aches, stuffy nose, fever (102f). Classic flu like symptoms. I was extremely sick all day Saturday (level of sick: 8/10). Day 2: Sunday morning March 7 I awoke again extremely sick, just as sick as Saturday. All same symptoms (level of sick: 7/10). Sunday night I was incredibly miserable, all flu symptoms, I did not sleep Sunday night, up all night and up all day the next day Monday. Day 3: Monday I continued to be sick, all same symptoms, all day long. This time the blood shot eyes &amp; bloody nose came on, fever was steady at 101f (level of sick: 6/10). Day 4: Tuesday woke up still stick, same flu like symptoms. I feel the headache has gotten worse, in fact way worse. Fever steady at 101f all day. Overall I&#39;m not as sick except the headache and fever (level of sick: 6/10).  Day 5: Wednesday I was really hoping I&#39;d make a full recovery but still still sick, fever dropped for a few hours then came back, fever peaks and bounces around at 101f. Headache is absolutely nasty, I feel intense pain in the back of my neck and head, hard to sleep or lay down. (level of sick: 5/10). Day 6: Thursday I feel like I&#39;m just about kick this sickness, feeling way better. I dont have a fever today but I still have an incredibly nasty headache, really intense, my eyes hurt, back of my neck hurts. (level of sick: 3/10). Day 7: Friday, no flu symptoms, finally!! But the headache continues, really bad. It sort of disables my ability to function with the headache. Back of my neck and back of head hurts, inside my brain hurts. Ugh! Day 8: Saturday, no flu, no fever, although still bad headache. I&#39;ve been taking Advil all week to help reduce the headache. It helps, but after about 6 hours later the headache returns.

                                                The morning of 2 April, I woke up with a fever, chills, sweating and an excruciating headache. The symptoms persisted for approximately 10 hours. The following Monday, I woke up with sharp pains across my chest and shortness of breath. I was admitted to the hospital Emergency Room for about 7 hours and subsequently diagnosed with pericarditis. It is unknown if the pericarditis was associated to the vaccine but thought it was a good idea to document here.

                                                I would like to report what happened with all the facts.  One week after I had vaccine, I had very serious nose bleeding in the morning. I said very serious because I felt it cannot stop by itself. I called 911 and went to ER. First time, I use 911 and ER. All previous nose bleeding is very minor and it will stop in a minute. But this time, I just felt the blood just pouring into my mouth. So I was scared and  asked my wife called 911. After 2-3 hours, the bleeding stopped and I back home. To be cautious, I made an appointment with family doctor on next day (24th). But the bleeding happened again in the evening ( cannot remember exactly, but around 9pm). This time I just used the clipper for my nose and it took another 2 hours for the bleeding to stop. I had a very rough night while sitting on bed and had very little sleep. The next morning (24th), the bleeding come back after I used the restroom. The same feeling as the two bleeding before. I rushed to doctor&#39;s office even not my appointment yet. The family doctor said he cannot do anything since he cannot observe the place of blooding and he does not have instrument needed. I was referred to a specialist. And luckily I had the same day appointment. We rushed there and after roughly several hours waiting, I was the specialist and finally he did the treatment. Since then, my nose is ok and no serious bleeding again.  After I saw the side effects of JJ vaccine, I think it is better for me to report you what happened. I strongly suspect that my serious bleeding was caused by the drop of platelet which was side effect of the vaccine. I will have one blood work today. And will let you know results if you are interested. Again, I never had such serious bleeding before and that is the reason for my suspect.  All the best

I fell asleep one hour into my arrival and slept for 17 hours. Up to and including today I am having headaches, pain in my legs on left side only, nausea, lack of sleep and a continued smell similar to dried blood after a injury. I have also have and continue to have shortness of breath and chest pains resulting in two panic attacks within the last three days. This has led me to report this and I have doctor visit scheduled for 4/22. I also reported today based on internet search of reactions.

                                                Pt. had (what we think) a small seizure on Thursday, March 18th and then again on Saturday, March 20th.  On Sunday, March 21st, 911 had to be called as his seizure did not end.  He had a grand male.  He was seizing for several hours.  At the time this was all occurring he has been on anti seizure meds for a few years Divalproex 1000 mg am and 1000 mgs pm daily).  He passed 1 week later, March 28 at approx 6:45pm at the Clinic.  I am unable to get any information  on his medical report for that week.  Statement from his Nurologists is on second page. Additional information for Item 18:   Statement:  47 year old gentleman who passed away on March 28 from aspiration pneumonia secondary to status epilepticus and on a history of multiple sclerosis / additional leukoencephalopathy of unknown etiology (both treated with rituximab), prior seizures (on valproic acid) and pulmonary embolism (on apixaban). The key reason for reaching out is in light of the announcement about the side effects of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine specifically cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. While he had a known history of seizures, he had no clear trigger for these seizures; including that his valproic acid level was therapeutic (83.0 mcg/mL) at time of presentation. He had, however, received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine on March 12 before having what in hindsight appeared to be repeated seizures between March 18-21; he had a more significant one on March 21 that hospitalized him. This time frame appears consistent with the reported cases of central venous sinus thrombosis associated with the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. Equally, he was taking apixaban at that point in time and his PLT (173) / INR (1.1) / PTT (36.6) at time of presentation were all normal and stable. He did have an elevated ProBNP (552.0) at presentation; nasopharyngeal swab was negative for COVID / Influenza A/B / RSV and non-contrast head CT did not show any clear new abnormalities. His only D-dimer was obtained on March 23 and was 226. He did not have a CT angiogram or venogram.   Overall the link between the vaccine and pt. seizures is not definite. At the same time, the similarity with the reported cases has led to me wanting to report it in case of the possible link. If you require further information then please don&#39;t hesitate to email me Pt. med list at the time of this incident  Modifinil - 100 mg/1per day/AM Sertraline - 100 mg/1per day/AM Vitamin D3 - 50 mg/1per day/AM Divalproex - 500 mg/2per day/AM Eliquis - 5 mg/1per day/AM Furoseminde - 20 mg/1per day/AM Metroprolol - 100 mg/1per day/AM Lisinopril - 10 mg/1per day/AM  Divalproex - 500 mg/2per day/PM Eliquis - 5 mg/1per day/PM Metroprolol - 100 mg/1per day/PM Melatonin - 5 mg/1per day/PM Quetiapine - 50 mg/3per day/PM

Imaging consistent with acute DVT and patient taken to IR for tPA direct catheter infusion.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s past medical history included coronary stent, and concurrent conditions included alcohol use (a beer or two a day after work), and non smoker, and other pre-existing medical conditions included the patient had no known drug allergies and no history of drug abuse or illicit drug usage. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 041A21A, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1total, administered on 05-APR-2021 to left arm for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included cefalexin for infection, acetylsalicylic acid, atorvastatin calcium, lisinopril, and metoprolol.  On 05-APR-2021, within the first hour after vaccination, the patient felt like crap (feeling sick) and took a bath and relaxed after that he felt better. On 14-APR-2021, while he was taking bath he yelled at his wife and also the patient experienced profuse nose bleed which lasted for 20 minutes. These nose bleeds occur at least 4 times daily lasting about 20 minutes each time. On 20-APR-2021, the patient went to emergency room and he had a plug procedure and was discharged.

On 28-APR-2021, a surgery for maxillary embolism was performed and he was discharged from the hospital on 01-MAY-2021. This was very stressful for the patient and his entire family. The patient was not prone to nose bleeds and so this has been scary. A week and half after vaccination, there seemed to be a 3-4inch long worm in the vein of his left outer thigh. The patient walked it off and it do go away relatively quickly. The patient&#39;s wife was not sure that what will happen next. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from seemed to be a 3-4inch long worm in the vein of his left outer thigh on 14-APR-2021, and felt like crap on 05-APR-2021, had not recovered from profuse nose bleed, and the outcome of maxillary embolism was not reported.

I tried about 40 minutes to stop it but wasnt successful so I was transported to hospital ER  where they had to cauterize it just to get it to stop.   I was advised I could not take anything but Tylenol to try to ensure the bleeding did not start again.   It never really got any better and I began developing a weird head pain in my head,  which caused severe headaches which the pain  being felt in my face and behind my eye area.  After the pain continued to get worse on 4/22 I had a virtual visit with Dr. who prescribed a steroid and antibiotic and advised I see an ENT.  I havent had any more nose bleeds but I do still get intermitten headaches from time to time

                                                On April 7th in the  morning, I woke with sharp pain in right calf.  It was not swollen, discolored, or hot.  I had not participated in any activity recently that I felt caused an injury.  I took Advil and Tylenol and rested for a few days, but the pain got worse.  On April 14th, after reading reports on some adverse affects from the J&amp;J vaccine, I made an appointment to see my primary physician.  After blood work and an ultrasound, I was diagnosed with a DVT in my right calf.  I have a started a 90-day cycle of Xarelto to treatment the DVT.

Later had DDIMER 560 on 4/15/21 due to h/o J&amp;J vaccine and CTA lung 4/29/2021 shows Right lower lobe pulmonary emboli.  Patient is clinically much better. No more SOB. Dizziness a little residual but significantly better. Never had hypoxia/tachycardia and BP always reassuring. Pt read about some blood thinner making clot worse and doesn&#39;t want to to start a blood thinner without checking with hematology first. I&#39;ve prescribed rivaroxaban so that pharmacy can start authorization and ensure coverage, but patient strongly states that he will not take it yet until hearing from hematology.

The patient went to sit in the waiting area and fell off his chair. Pharmacy staff rushed to him to find him on the floor conscious and speaking stating he was okay. The patient was assisted to stand and get on a chair. At that point Orange Juice and Water were provided to the patient and the pharmacist sat next to him for ten minutes. Next, the patient was instructed to stay for five more minutes to make sure he was okay. The patient stated this happens to him every time he gets a vaccine and it isn&#39;t out of the ordinary at all. Patient also stated he did not eat or drink much all day besides a bag of chips and on top of that was doing strenuous work in the heat all day and this could have contributed to his collapse.

                                                I had some head pressure - dull headache each day for a couple of weeks starting about five days after vaccine; I didn&#39;t notice until the evenings when I was relaxing. From day 5 or so - for about two weeks I noticed this head pressure. My blood pressure did rise  at that time-it was elevated - within about two weeks after the shot, I couldn&#39;t control my blood pressure. I went to the doctor  - they had to raise my blood pressure medication to the max because I couldn&#39;t get my blood pressure down and I even donated blood.  Today I am at 135 over 90 which is good for me but at that time  when I noticed the rise after the vaccine - I was running 165 over 115 . I&#39;m still taking the maximum blood pressure medication that I can take currently but it is at a good level currently. I was taking 20 mg pills and after the vaccine we tried to raise it to  25 mg and then raised it up to 30 mg and then they finally said up to 40 mg a day. It&#39;s the most I can take.   I have chest pains on the right side of my chest -it will start (on a scale from 1 to 10 -  it&#39;s about a four) - it&#39;s shooting pain - in my chest for about 10 minutes and then it will move to my left side - not my pecs -  it feels like it&#39;s my  heart. It&#39;s not enough that I feel like I&#39;m having a heart attack - it happens about four days a week. It doesn&#39;t last real long - but it&#39;s intense. A &#34;4&#34; pain for me is intense. It goes on for about 5 minutes - switch sides and then another five minutes - I try to relax/watch tv during that.  I did have leg pains in the middle of all of this time - hand, inner thigh, then on my right leg - single spots of pain that moved - like ant bites - that happened in the beginning - at day five and after - the same time I was getting the head pressure. I would rub over the spot with my hands and then it would go away and go to a different spot.

I wasn&#39;t on going so I didn&#39;t worry about it but another week after that I began to feel palpitations and decided to go to the emergency room at Hospital. I was given an EKG and an X -Ray of my chest. They didn&#39;t notice any abnormalities so they told me to follow up with my physician. My doctor made an appointment for me to have a stress test. I was on the treadmill for 6 minutes and my blood pressure dropped so low that Dr. called an ambulance to take me to the hospital.  I was there from the 27th to the 30th of May taking test.  I  also had a cardiac cath test which came back inconclusive. Another symptom that now is troubling me is vertigo

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included exercise induced asthma, and no tobacco use (both current and historically), and other pre-existing medical conditions included the patient had no known allergies. The patient was not obese, denied recent procedures, prolonged immobility, family history of bleeding or clotting disease, etc. The patient was up to date on cancer screenings based on age/family history. He was reported as being an unusually physically active and fit 48 year-old male who has enjoyed good health and exercised regularly. In 2019, his platelet count was 177 10*9/L. The patient reported flying out of town and back on 30-MAR-2021 and 04-APR-2021 respectively with the longest continuous flight lasting around 4 hours. The patient at age 48, received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 201A21A, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 07-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included finasteride, and salbutamol.  On  an unspecified date in APR-2021, the patient experienced mild headache.  On 18-APR-2021, 11 days after receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced deep vein thrombosis, vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia; new pain in his big toe, bilateral leg cramping (muscle spasm), bilateral lower extremity pain, and swelling. The patient attributed soreness in the large muscle groups of his thighs to Peloton riding and exercise. The patient travelled again via airplane to an unspecified location 22-APR-2021 and 25-APR-2021 (both1 hr long flights). The patient administered Advil for the leg pain when he returned on an unspecified date. On an unspecified date he felt a leg vessel that &#34;didn&#39;t seem right.&#34; On 26-APR-2021 the patient went to emergency department for evaluation presenting with leg pain and chest discomfort. He had normal vital signs and oxygen saturation. Additional laboratory results: Platelet count (NR 140-440  K/uL) 74;  fibrinogen (NR 150-430 mg/dL) of 254; D-dimer (NR 0-499 ng/mL FEU) 15,109 ng/mL FEU; activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) (NR 25.1-36.5 s)  31.8.  Venous duplex ultrasound of the lower extremities revealed non-occlusive DVT in the bilateral popliteal veins extending to the gastrocnemius veins, an occlusive DVT of the left posterior tibial vein, as well as occlusive superficial venous thrombosis in the bilateral saphenous veins.  The patient was discharged from the emergency room on rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily with two-day follow-up with his primary care physician. He had no known exposure to heparin before the onset of symptoms and no exposure during his emergency room visit. On 28-APR-2021 (also reported as the next day), the patient complained of a new onset of chest pain (pleuritic) and presented again to the emergency room.  Chest CT showed presence of acute pulmonary embolism, with emboli present in segmental and more proximal arteries. He had already taken his rivaroxaban for the night (1800). The patient was hospitalized for further evaluation and work up. A peripheral smear showed thrombocytopenia without schistocytes. The hematology service was consulted, and a presumptive diagnosis of VITT (vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia) was made. His anti-PF4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (LIFECODES PF4 IgG), performed on a sample collected prior to initiating IVIG therapy, demonstrated a strongly positive result of 3.323 optical density (OD) units (reference interval &lt; 0.399), consistent with a diagnosis of VITT. The patient was immediately treated with 1 g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) for 2 days, 1 mg/kg of prednisone, and switched from rivaroxaban to an intravenous argatroban infusion drip, during which he achieved therapeutic aPTT levels between 44 - 50 sec.  The patient was also treated with apixaban.  Other studies included:  Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and angiography (MRA) of the brain, performed due to symptoms of mild headaches, were unremarkable. Platelet factor 4 (NR: not provided) strong positive at 2.9 OD; Prothrombin mutation G20210A not detected, Red blood cell count (NR: 3.98 - 5.98) 5.07 M/ microliter, Red blood cell sedimentation rate (NR: not provided) Normal, SARS-CoV-2 test was negative, Serotonin release assay was positive, and WBC (NR: 3.2 - 10.6) 5.8 K/microliter. Anticardiolipin antibodies (NR: not provided) 5 GPL, Beta-2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies (NR: 0 - 20) 0 SGU, 5 SMU, Blood homocysteine (NR: not provided) 13.4 nml (normal), C-reactive protein (NR: not provided) 2.6, Cardiolipin immunoglobulin G (NR: 0 - 12) 6 MPL, Cell marker increased was positive, EKG (NR: not provided) Normal, Hematocrit (NR: 36.9 - 52.1) 42.2 %, Hemoglobin (NR: 2.5 - 18.0) 15.0 g/dL, Lupus anticoagulant (NR: not provided) not detected, MCHC (NR: 33.4 - 35.3) 35.5 g/dL, MCV (NR: 80.6 - 97.6) 83.2 fL. On an unspecified date the serotonin release assay was no longer positive. Within a week post-discharge, the patient developed recurrent thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count that down trended to 107  10*9/L  His thrombocytopenia appeared to somewhat correlate with prednisone dose adjustments, suggesting an autoimmune-driven process, although it did not respond to repeat IVIG administration. Due to the normalized D-Dimer levels and negative SRA, it was assumed that there was no further ongoing platelet activation. The authors stated the patient had no prior risk factors for thrombosis other than the 2 recent 4-hour flights. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from bilateral lower extremity pain, was recovering from deep vein thrombosis, vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, platelet count decreased, swelling, full blood count, metabolic function tests, muscle spasms, ultrasound doppler abnormal, and multiple acute bilateral pulmonary emboli, and the outcome of mild headache was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged). This case is a duplicate of 20210642952.  Additional information was received from literature article on 19-JUN-2021. The following information was updated and incorporated into the case narrative: literature reference information, additional reporters, laboratory data, updated events.  It has been determined that Manufacture Report Number 20210514958 is a duplicate of deleted case 20210642952. All relevant information from Manufacture Report Number 20210642952 will be reported in this case 20210514958.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V2: Follow up consisted of a literature citation, presenting this case as a case report.  This does not change the previous assessment. This case obtained via VAERS (ID 1264060) concerns a 48-year-old White male who developed symptoms of bilateral lower extremity deep vein thromboses (DVT) and thrombocytopenia 11 days after receiving Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. Concurrent conditions included exercise induced asthma. Patient was not obese, did not smoke, denied recent procedures, family history of bleeding/clotting disease &amp; was physically active. He was up to date on cancer screenings based on age/family history. He had taken two 1-hour long flights 15 days and 18 days post-vaccination.  Concomitant medications included finasteride &amp; salbutamol. After 1 week of bilateral leg cramping &amp; swelling which began 11 days post-vaccination, he presented to emergency department (ED) where complete blood count showed platelets 74 k/uL, peripheral smear with giant platelets, and d-Dimer 15K. Venous duplex ultrasound showed nonocclusive DVT in the bilateral popliteal veins extending to the gastrocnemius veins, occlusive superficial vein thrombosis in the bilateral saphenous veins, and occlusive DVT of the left posterior tibial vein. He was started on rivaroxaban &amp; was not hospitalized. Two days later, he developed new chest pain &amp; returned to ED, where CT chest showed numerous bilateral pulmonary emboli. He was hospitalized; empiric treatment for vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia was started: IVIG, steroids, &amp; argatroban.  Anti-PF4 resulted as OD=2.9 and 3.323 (strong positive), confirming diagnosis. The patient was recovering from the events. Based on evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS, per definition from Brighton Collaboration), low platelet count &amp; temporal relationship to vaccination, the events are assessed to have a plausible relationship with vaccination.

Primary, Dr., sent me for ultrasound, which showed I had several blood clots in my leg.  I have never had any blood clots before.  Dr.  referred me to Hematologist, Dr.  She ran extensive blood tests and found no genetic predisposition for clots.  She stated it was likely the vaccine that caused me to develop blood clots.  I am now on blood thinners to try to dissolve them and may have to take them for life if the clots don&#39;t go away in the new few months.  Follow up ultrasound scheduled 9/7/21.

                                                DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS; This spontaneous report received from a consumer concerned a 49 year old male. The patient&#39;s weight was 80.3 kilograms, and height was 182.9 centimeters. The patient&#39;s past medical history included post-operative deep vein thrombosis (more than 30 years ago), depression, heart murmur, and back surgery, and his concurrent conditions included non-smoker, no alcohol use, and marijuana abuse. The patient had no history of known allergies. The patient&#39;s mother had a history of aneurysm.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: unknown, and expiry date: unknown) dose was not reported, administered on 08-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. Concomitant medications included fexofenadine hydrochloride (Allegra) for allergy, rivaroxaban (Xarelto) for venous thromboembolism, and omeprazole (Prilosec) for unknown indication. About one and half weeks after vaccination, on 21-APR-2021, the patient was taken to the emergency department and was admitted with the complaints of leg pain since 2 days with suspected blood clot in leg. Over the last days, patient&#39;s left leg looked swollen compared to the right leg. The patient also had pain, initially started in groin area and radiated down across the anterior portion of the leg, then to posterior leg, and into toes. The patient also had some intermittent tingling in toes. The patient denied of weakness, numbness or persistent paresthesia. The patient was concerned regarding the pain as it felt similar to the post-operative deep vein thrombosis he had in the past. The patient had been anxious since vaccination when hearing about the development of blood clots. The patient also denied of fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and difficulty walking. On 21-APR-2021 16:25, the patient&#39;s laboratory data included: Blood pressure (148/66 mmHg), Body mass index (24), Body temperature (98.8 F), Oxygen saturation (100 %) Pulse rate (88), and Respiratory rate (16). On 21-APR-2021 16:32, laboratory data included: Blood pressure (148/66 mmHg), Body temperature (97.8 F), Oxygen saturation (100 %), Pulse rate (91), and Respiratory rate (15). Other general physical examinations included: General: Well-developed well-nourished in no acute distress. HEENT (Head, Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat) examination:  normocephalic atraumatic extra ocular motions are intact. Neck examination: Supple without jugular vein distention or meningismus. Lung examination: Clear auscultation bilaterally without wheezes rales or rhonchi. Heart examination: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs rubs or gallops. Abdomen examination: Soft no tender non-distended without rebound or guarding. Extremities: Without clubbing cyanosis edema, no lacerations or abrasions or ecchymosis noted, no appreciable size difference in the left leg compared to the right, the patient had some tenderness throughout palpation of the medial thigh on the left with radiation up into the left inguinal region, no calf tenderness or swelling, no erythema, palpable posterior tibialis pulse. Skin examination: Warm and dry and well perfused. Psych examination: Appropriate mood and affect. Neuro examination: Cranial nerves 2-12 are grossly intact, strength is 5/5 in upper and lower extremities, full distal sensation in the left lower extremity, full plantar and dorsiflexion of the left foot including the left great toe, sensation is grossly intact, awake, alert and oriented x3.  On ultrasound Doppler venous lower extremity test, identified sub occlusive thrombus in the left superficial femoral veins, likely related to organizing/chronic thrombus, however no prior imaging was available at the institution for comparison, no evidence of occlusive deep vein thrombosis. The final diagnosis was made as Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).  At no time the patient had ever endorsed any chest pain/pleuritic pain, shortness of breath or exertional dyspnea. Due to the nature of this clot, a course of anticoagulation was planned. Patient was prescribed with Xarelto at twice daily starting doses, with transition to 20 mg doses. During the initiation of treatment, the patient should be followed up by his primary care physician for further evaluation. The patient stated that he would call the primary care physician in the following morning for follow-up appointment. The patient was discharged from the hospital on APR-2021. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of deep vein thrombosis was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: 20210457179-Covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s-deep vein thrombosis. This event is considered not related. The event has a compatible/suggestive temporal relationship, is unlabeled, and has unknown scientific plausibility. There are other factors more likely to be associated with the event than the drug. Specifically: MEDICAL HISTORY

He came home and collapsed due to the fatigue which is not normal for him.   About 12 hours later his throat got scratchy, achy but doable.  He went to work and had to leave early due to flu-like symptoms, felt feverish.   Really bad aches now, and his breathing and heart rate are elevated right now.  Achy-like headaches.   He did take some Ibuprofen 800 mg and seems to be helping.  He has had the typical soreness of getting the vaccine in the left shoulder, but otherwise ok.  He also has a stuffy nose, scratchy throat and his eyes are a little red and glassy.    He was directly exposed to somebody for 25 hours that was positive for COVID, but nobody else in the car got COVID in January.

                                                I started having a lot of pain in my right leg. I could actually feel and see that my veins were swollen. It progressed and started moving around. I started having chest pain and headaches. I ended up at ER. They gave me pain meds and did a CT Scan and ultrasound, which were both clear. The next day, I was walking around and my hand and arm started hurting and then went numb. My right wrist was swollen to twice its size. I went to care and they told me to go back to the ER. They eventually did another ultrasound, but the swelling had gone down by then. A few hours later, my left arm started to swell and lasted for about 4 hours. From there, I had pain in my arms and legs for a few days after that, but then I was fine.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s pre-existing medical conditions included patient had no known allergies. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 204A21A, expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total, administered on 12-JUN-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 12-JUN-2021, health care professional (HCP) reported that patient received Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. About 2.5-3 minutes after receiving the injection, the patient began having seizure like activity. HCP described that as full postured seizure like in the upper extremities and chest, and the eyes had been nystagmus. This activity lasted approximately 45 seconds. Emergency medical services (EMS) staff was on the scene and when they came to, the patient self-reported that he was not feeling well and the HCP described him as diaphoretic and was appearing shaky. EMS took his vitals initially (Blood Pressure, BP 87/64 mmHg, Pulse rate 50 unit unspecified and oxygen saturation 100 percentage). Vitals at 5 Min (Blood Pressure, BP 124/80 mmHg, Pulse rate 76 unit unspecified, oxygen saturation 100 percentage and blood glucose level 125 unit unspecified). An ambulance was called to transport the patient to the ER, and upon arrival vitals were taken again at about 10 Min. Post-ictal (Blood Pressure, BP 115/76 mmHg and pulse rate 76 unit unspecified). Patient was taken to the ER for further evaluation. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of the seizure like activity, not feeling well, BP 87/64, pulse rate 50 and diaphoretic was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:20210627629-covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s-seizure like activity, BP 87/64 This event(s) is considered unassessable.

                                                Within a couple of weeks after the vaccine, I started experiencing hear palpitations. They would happen through most of the day on and off at different times. They started a few at a time during a sitting and then started to last for longer periods of the day. Once it grew to the point of scaring me, I booked a Cardiology visit. By the time the doctors were able to examine me, they saw the issue on the EKG and booked a number of follow up tests. I had never had these before nor any heart issue. Since the offices were so busy there was a number of weeks that passed before I could get the first test, a Holter Monitor. At that point since it had been over 3 weeks, the very bad sessions had died down a bit but I still had sporadic hear palpitations. I recorded over 12 instances of what feels like a fluttering or drop in beats in my chest. Following the results which were &#34;within normal parameters&#34; 2 weeks went by until my next appointment. I then had a stress test which showed I did not have any blockages or blood flow issues. Another week or more went by and I had an echocardiogram. While taking the test, I did report and the tester confirmed that they saw skipped beats during the test 2 times. By this point the issue was subsiding and the results reported were not outside of normal parameters for a person my age. At the final meeting, the doctor adamantly claimed that the vaccine had no part in this problem stating that there are no reported cases of this issue due to the vaccine, but to me, timing of this issue and the fact that I never had any of these problems before the vaccine was administered seem to indicate otherwise. That said it should be documented and doctors should know about it. I want people to know I had it post vaccine, and that now the issue seems to be gone. This gave me and my family great anxiety, discomfort and more. I am unsure if these symptoms could be worse for people with heart issues or weaker hearts as well, so I am reporting it.

Then, after about 23 hours after the injection, bad headache (especially around the eyes - which also caused light sensitivity) and general malaise. Shortly thereafter, low-grade fever (99.5 F) and significant muscle pain, all over the body.  The most worrisome side effect was the last one, which appeared during the second night after the injection (about 32-33 hours after the injection): extremely fast heartbeat / racing heart.   I did not use any treatments for these side effects.

It didn&#39;t happen again until today morning again 4/5/2012 @ 7.10am when i went to use the restroom again and noticed my nose running again and it was blood running down my nose. before this, i have never had a situation where blood runs down my nose until now.

                                                I received the Johnson and Johnson Covid 19 vaccine on 4/6/21 and the dose code is 041AZ1A. I received it at the Community Center.  I&#39;m writing because beginning with the evening after I received the Johnson and Johnson Covid 19 vaccine I&#39;ve been having abdominal / stomach cramps and stomach pain. Sometimes it is on the top of the abdomen / stomach, other times it&#39;s at the bottom. Sometimes it hurts to the point of waking me up in the middle of the night. This morning it started moving into my chest.  Do you know if this pain will subside shortly or what is known about this potential side effect? Is there anything I can do to mitigate the issue?  I&#39;m contacting my Dr for a visit.

After going to the chiropractor two times the knot and pain ended up in my right leg. I then went to Urgent Care where they diagnosed me with a large blood clot. They sent me to imaging and after scanning the area confirmed that there was a blood clot in my right leg. Urgent Care then set me up with a specialist.

I also had irregular heart beat for 16-18 hours. I have had neurological issues with 2 other medications in the past which calmed my concerns. I had my arms lock up on me while on Humira and I had the exact facial numbness and tingling with Enbrel. Both of those drugs work through TNF cells. I do not know the mechanism with J&amp;J vaccine but wanted you to know that.

On an unspecified date (reported as 22-MAR-2021; 28 days prior to vaccination), the patient experienced shortness of breath, heart rate increased, runny nose, chills and was hospitalized (date unspecified). He reported that on this past Saturday, 17-APR-2021 (2 days prior to vaccination), he went to the emergency room. He reported that his toenails were coming off, the skin on his toes was coming off, and he had swelling in his right foot and up his leg. He says there was no circulation going to his toe and he was diagnosed with having a blood clot in his right leg. He says he had surgery to open up the arteries in his leg, and also reported gangrene in his toe. The subject was discharged on 21-APR-2021. On 23-APR-2021, the patient experienced feeling hot. He also reported that he may need to have his right pinky (fifth) toe amputated because it has gangrene. He reported that he is going to go back to the hospital, to which he would seek medical attention if he was having issues. Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included paracetamol. When called back due to his vaccination dates being after event start dates, the patient said that his memory is not too good, so he &#39;had to take his time to remember the correct dates&#39;. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S was not applicable. The patient was recovering from blood clot in leg, and had not recovered from runny nose, shortness of breath, heart rate increased, chills, feeling hot, gangrene in toe, right leg swollen, and right foot swollen. This report was serious (caused hospitalization).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 50-year-old  hypertensive and diabetic male patient reported that he was feeling hot and may need to have his fifth toe amputated because it has gangrene 4 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and 2 days after discharge form the hospital.  The patient was hospitalized for shortness of breath, heart rate increased, runny nose, and chills 28 days prior to vaccination.  The patient went to the emergency room 2 days prior to vaccination because his toenails/skin on his toes were coming off, swelling in his right foot and up his leg, gangrene in his toe; he reported that there was no circulation going to his toe and was diagnosed with having a blood clot in his right leg; the patient reported he had surgery to &#34;open up&#34; the arteries in his leg. Four days after vaccination, the patient felt hot and reported reported that he may need to have his right pinky (fifth) toe amputated because it has gangrene.  The patient is taking paracetamol as treatment.  No other details was reported.  Based on the lack of temporal association, the causality is considered not related for the events blood clot in leg, shortness of breath, heart rate increased, right leg swelling, right foot swelling, chills, and runny nose.  The information available regarding event gangrent of fifth toe and feeling hot precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

                                                I received the vaccination at approximately 09:40 a.m., as of FRI., Jun. 11, 2021. Later that night, at approximately 12:00 a.m., CDT, Jun. 12, 2021, I began experiencing what I would deem to be adverse side-effects due to the injection of the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine I received at the health-clinic earlier in the day from the healthcare-staffer onsite. I began suffering  sharp pain in the head due to what appeared to be the clenching of a blood-vessel in the brain, as if I were experiencing a blockage, or blood-clotting in a blood-vessel in the brain, due to the injection of the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine which I received earlier in the day at the health-clinic building. I also, began experiencing chest pains on that night due to, again, what I trust would have been the injection of the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine at the health-care building by an onsite-agent administering the inoculation on my behalf. I also began to experience what appeared to be a &#34;narcotic&#34;-like stimulation of the central nervous-system due to a a particular chemical-compound appearing in the formula in use by manufactures to develop the vaccine itself. I experienced what to me appeared to be a &#34;narcotic&#34;-like high as one would experience after consuming a substance high in narcotic-content, such as cocaine or alcohol, which triggered a stimulation, as I said, of the central nervous-system on that occasion.  Such side-effects are due to the fact the manufacturers in developing the inoculation did not utilize a wide sample-population for study in clinical trials of the dosage in order to determine side-effects caused by the vaccine in certain members of the population who could have an adverse reaction to the formula of chemical compounds appearing in the medication due to its effect on them physiologically. I.e., the need to quickly introduce an antiviral inoculation into the marketplace put pressure on the manufacturers to disregard lengthy clinical trials which would prove the vaccine to have very negative side-effects on certain members of the population who receive it as a vaccination against Covid-19.

                                                Type 1 diabetic on an insulin pump.  Diabetes is well managed with a typical blood glucose level of 110.  BG has been in 300s since 6pm 7/3/21. Insulin administration is not able to bring it down. As of 10:30am 7/4 BG is still holding steady at 302 with no food eaten and 3x the usual daily amount of insulin given in the last 12 hours.  We are not administering more at this time due to the possibility of BG dropping exponentially once the side effect wears off.   Patient also experienced an unexpected low BG of 35 at around 4pm 7/3.

SATURDAY MORNING I ALSO NOTICED MY LEFT LEG WAS SWOLLEN AND HAD A BLUEISH/REDDISH COLOR AND WAS THROBBING. FROM TIME TO TIME i WOULD EXPERIENCE A SHARP PAIN BEHIND MY KNEE AND THIGH. AFTER A WEEK THE SYMPTOMS DID NOT GO AWAY SO I WENT TO THE DOCTOR. HE ORDERED AN ULTRASOUND ON MY LEG. THAT SAME DAY I HAD THE ULTRASOUND WHERE THEY FOUND MULTIPLE BLOOD CLOTS IN MY LEFT LEG. DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY PUT ME ON ELIQUIS. THE DOSE FOR THE FIRST 2 WEEKS WAS 10MG TWICE A DAY (10 MG MORNING AROUND 8AM AND 10 MG AROUND 8 PM). AFTER 14 DAYS HE REDUCED MY DOSE TO 5 MG AM AND 5 MG PM.

                                                migraines, vision issues within 12 hrs.  On 4-29 I had a TIA (complete loss of right side and couldnt speak for 10 min).  I went to hospital and had CT, ekg, blood work, all were ok.   Cardiologist determined I did have a TIA and after an Echocardiogram discovered a Patent Ovale Foramen (hole in heart) and recommended immediate closure.  Surgeon also said to get the procedure but as of now my insurance has not approved payment.  I have been having numbness and pain in hands and feet (mostly left side) along with vision issues, dizzyness, problem finding words and concentration, fatigue.  I went to Hospital again on 6-27 due to pain and numbness in left hand and foot and doctor said he could admit me but I did&#39;nt stay.   I have gone from a healthy person who is very active to  someone who is always tired and is constantly worried about having another TIA.

                                                I am diabetic and use a Medtronic Minimed insulin pump. Beginning approximately 4 hours after I received the vaccine my blood sugar increased to unacceptable levels. I immediately began taking extra boluses of insulin to bring my blood sugar back own to normal. I have a chart to use to guide the amount of extra bolus needed to bring blood sugars back down to normal. I followed that chart, which always works, but my blood sugars did not decrease as expected. As a result I took even more extra boluses which lowered my blood sugar nominally but not to normal levels. My blood sugars have continued to be high as of 42 hours after receiving the vaccination.

On 4/6/21 I came home from work about 7:00 am due to an extreme headache and muscle weakness. By the afternoon my fever was up to 101. On 4/7 my fever went up to 102.7 and I was shaking uncontrollably, sweating , dizzy, headache, and had heaviness in my chest. I felt as if I were going to have a stroke. The headache was excruciating. I took acetaminophen 500 x 2 and 400 mg of ibuprofen, and Theraflu to try and alleviate the symptoms. On 4/9/21 my fever broke, but the weakness, dizziness and headaches have continued. I currently have ongoing headaches and dizziness. I have not gone to the doctor because I do not have a PCP. I am looking for one now.

He was transferred to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a flesh eating bacteria in the right leg where the pain was at and Sepsis.  He was taken to surgery to debride the right leg and was started on CVVHD because his new kidney was now failing, he eventually was started back on Hemodialysis and taken to surgery 2 more times where he cardiac arrested on the table in surgery and died.  A private autopsy is being performed but the preliminary results shows he had multi-system organ failure, including his liver which was NEVER a problem in the past.

Staff immediately supported him and he stayed in the chair. He regained consciousness within a few seconds. A cot was brought to him, he was assisted by staff and laid on the cot, cool cloth applied to his forehead. Within 8 minutes he was feeling better, sitting up on the cot, drinking water. He did report that he has previously passed out at the sight of blood, and there was a small amount of blood at the injection site.  We observed him for another 25 minutes and he returned to baseline, stated he was feeling fine. He went home with his step Dad, who had given him a ride to the clinic. I called the patient 2 hours later to check on him. Step Dad reported he was outside and unavailable, but that he has been feeling fine since leaving the clinic.

                                                Running up a hill and became severely short of breath with significant chest pain in center of chest.  Had to lie on the ground to rest and catch breath.  Several minutes to catch breath and about 10 minutes for chest pain to resolve.   One month later had chest pain in center of chest... went to urgent care... EKG and vital signs showed normal. Two months after vaccine, started having forceful heart beat, lightheadedness, fatigue, pins/needles neuropathy in right foot... Lightheadedness and neuropathy was episodic, sometimes for hours, for a week... Fatigue was worse for a week then gradually eased but remains mild to moderate fluctuating... Forceful heart beat has continued but was worse 3 weeks ago and is always worse lying down and improves when sitting up though can be mildly present sitting up... and continues today. Seeing my primary care doctor to assess.   Went to clinic 3 times in last month for this... vitals always normal and one additional EKG normal.

We quickly checked his temperature however it was within normal range. We applied cold packs to his wrists, forehead, and face for about 12 minutes. I checked for normal capillary refill and asked him questions to assess his mental status. About 20 minutes after starting the treatment, patient started improving. He returned almost back to normal in about 30 minutes.

                                                Approximately three weeks after receiving Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, I began to get pains in legs. Calves were aching and throbbing. Didn&#39;t think anything of it at first....just thought achy muscles and such. The day before Easter (April 3rd 2021) decided since the pain was continuing and the internet will scare you to death - I went to a local Emergency Room in advance,  I had an ultrasound on my left leg and it was noted I had DVT. (blood clot in left calf)  To briefly explain: I had an achilles issue back in Nov. 2020 (slight micro tear - achilles tendonitis) I thought maybe this was related to that, as I had not been to the doctor to get it checked until early March 2021. and it bothered me off and on for a few months. I thought the calf pain may have been related to that?  I explained to the emergency room doctor about my achilles and thought it was an issue related to that. They decided to perform an ultrasound on my left leg. Which noted the DVT/Blood Clot. They put me on a starter pack of Xarelto and I am to follow up with my normal doctor on April 22, 2021.

Mindset went back but still could not speak too much. 4/2/21, Fri night.  After bible study at night, almost all bro &amp; sis said that was symptom of stroke, and suggested us to see emergency doctor.  On 11pm, we were at emergency room.  4/3/21, Sat. I was admitted 1-2 am into impatience room. CT diagnosed a big gray area in between speech are and spine. 4/3/21, Sat afternoon. MRI and MRA had been tested.  Cardiologist said he could not rule out the last option, which was due to slow heart beat 50-60. But I have slow heart beat since I remembered things from 4-5 year-old. He suggested wearing a heart monitoring device for a 4 weeks after discharged.  4/4/21, Sun noon.  Doctor admitted to discharge. They could not find cause, and would like to follow up within 1 to 2 weeks after discharging.  4/13/21, Tue night, I started wiring body monitoring device.

By 8:00, I was feeling tired enough that I went to bed early.  By 9:00, I had terrible chills and body aches throughout my body.   The aches were worse in my chest / torso -- maybe from so much shaking.  I did not watch any of the men&#39;s championship game that night.  I also felt nauseous but I seemed to lack the strength to vomit.  I can not remember a time when I had so much physical pain in my life.  My hands felt numb / tingling.  I tried to drink some ginger ale but drinking was difficult.  Although I was aware that I was breathing and my heart was beating, I thought that I might die.  The terrible pain continued for a few hours.  Around 10:30 PM, the pain dissipated.  However, after about 10 minutes of relief, the pain returned, perhaps worse than before.  At around 11:30, my wife came to bed.  She suggested that I try relaxing Yoga breathing.   I did that and the pain stopped and I fell asleep.   The next day, I woke up with a typical headache and took more Tylenol.  I continued to improve the remainder of the day.

Went to urgent Care on 4/8 where treated for severe dehydration and stomach aligment.  From 4/9 - 4/14 continued to suffer from same symptoms and then began to have heart taching, feeling as if there was a bubble in my chest.  Went back to Urgent Care on 4/14 and was again treated for dehydration.  Outcome is that no one knows why I have been feeling this way except for that it is a direct result of receiving the vaccine.

We thought it was related to the weather getting warm and we work the night shift, so he rested and increased his water intake. He was able to go to work on Monday night and return home and continued to rest on Tuesday. On Tuesday, there was no numbness, but there was weakness in both his legs. On Wednesday, he felt weakness throughout his body, especially in his legs. On Thursday, he collapsed. He did not lose consciences but his legs gave out under him and he was not able to get up up. He was taken to the hospital. He was diagnosed with a stroke, increased sugars (diabetes he has never had before), acute kidney injury, and uncontrolled increased blood pressure. He was hospitalized and discharged April 19, 2021. He was readmitted 04/24/2021 for another stroke.

He sat for about 10-15 minutes longer and we made sure he was feeling good before he left.

He was difficult to wake up and confused when he did. We called 911 and paramedics came to check him out. They monitored his blood pressure and pulse. His pulse was high (120-130bpm), so they thought it would be best to take him to the hospital so he can be checked out.

                                                Vaccine administered Thursday, 4/1 1:15 p.m. By Sunday I experienced mild headache and upper respiratory scratchiness. By late Monday 4/5 I experienced fatigue, dizziness, upper respiratory scratchiness and increased post-nasal drip, tightness in my chest, muscle soreness and headache. By Tuesday, 4/6 around 10 a.m. in addition to the above symptoms I had a severe headache and lost feeling in my right arm for half an hour, with severe muscle cramps and loss of use in that arm. The muscle issues subsided by early afternoon leaving only fatigue, headache, dizziness and a lingering respiratory tightness and sinus issues. Concerned about vaccine side-effects I was reading about, I made a doctor&#39;s appointment for the following week (earliest available), met with a physician&#39;s assistant who prescribed an antibiotic (Doxycycline Mono 100 Mg) for the sinus issues but did not address the other issues.

                                                abdominal pain. The pain was so severe that my knees would buckle and several times if I was holding anything, it caused me to drop it. After about a week, I had an appointment at 4:30 and was scheduled for the next morning at 8:30 to meet with a back and spine doctor for xrays.  Xrays were negative.  I was then schedule with a neck and hand specialist a few days later. This appointment could not provide a diagnosis.  Back and abdominal pain increase and soreness had spread to the stomach and groin.  After the news broke of the cerebral blood clots in 6 women.  See attached Continuation Page.

                                                1st day of vaccine; I felt very tired and fatigued  and my joints started to hurt and I could not walk due to the pain in my joints. 3rd and 4th day of vaccine; I started to experience numbness sensation to my hands. I also had numbness sensation to my face, right side and lips and also to my head. I went to Urgent Care where lab work was performed as well as a CT scan of the head to check for blood clots and results came back normal. Also an U/S of the right leg to check for any blood clots was performed which came back normal. I then went to see my PCP who performed more tests and exams, again did lab work to check for blood coagulation and still continued with the numbness sensation to my hands and all to my body. After about 10 days of my vaccine, I noticed that my oxygen level was 87, 96, 86, 92 and where my oxygen level has always been around 98 or 99.  I will be also having heart studies in a few weeks. I have not recovered from my symptoms and feel very fatigued and tired all the days.

                                                I experienced dizziness, headaches, SOB, chest pains, diarrhea, nausea, occurred when I am under physical stress.   Walking 10ft or up the stairs triggered my symptoms. Once I stopped moving, my symptoms would dissipate.   I called my PCP along with a cardiologist up until today.   I was tested for blood clots, had complete blood panel, stress test and nuclear stress test. My symptoms are getting better but still have mildly present.  My last meeting with the cardiologist, what he saw after the nuclear stress test, that there was a lack of blood flow where to the lower right heart chamber. He said it probably due to a blood blockage or plague and at this time he is trying to figure it out.

                                                In March I had a pain in my left calf muscle that I could not identify with getting hit or injuring it in any way. I called Urgent care because i read and heard about problem with the J&amp;J vaccine that it was giving people blood clots. Urgent care said there was no need to come in that there was very little reason to believe that it was a blood clot. Then in June I woke up to very severe pain in my left leg from my foot all the way to my thigh. It was hot, swollen and I could barely bend my knee. I went to Urgent Care and they sent me across the street to the Hospital for an ultra sound on my leg. Here are the result from the ultra sound.  Real time color Doppler imaging and spectral analysis were performed during ultrasound evaluation of the left lower extremity is performed. There is persistent occlusive deep venous thrombosis within the mid to distal superficial femoral vein extending nonocclusive bleed to involve the popliteal vein and exclusively within the proximal popliteal and peroneal veins of the calf. The doctor put me on 3 week of taking a blood thinner twice a day and then will go down to taking one blood thinner once a day for 6 months. I also saw MD. Here are his notes from my Drs appt. Patient is seen today, 6/14/2021, to discuss management of left leg DVT.   Patient presented to urgent care on 5/20/2021.  He had noticed soreness in his left leg for a couple of days and then he awoke that day and the leg was swollen.  The duplex scan showed that he had occlusive clot involving left superficial femoral vein extending through popliteal vein down to peroneal vein in the left calf.  He was started on rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily.   He transitions to 20 mg rivaroxaban daily tomorrow.   The leg soreness has eased slightly but the swelling has not improved.  He did have a repeat duplex scan on 6/7/2021 which was unchanged.  Thrombus persisted but was not worse.   He has not had chest pain or breathing issues or dyspnea.  He does recall that about 4 weeks earlier he had a muscle spasm sensation in the left calf.  He had received a Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid immunization in late February, 2021.  He was aware of the public information about venous clotting in women who had received the J&amp;J vaccine and was also aware that it involved cerebral veins.  He called his provider and was asked questions about the leg and otherwise the answers were negative.  So imaging was not obtained.  The muscle spasm sensation did not recur.   His family history is negative for clots in his personal history for clots is otherwise negative.  He is a maintenance manager.  He has not had lengthy travel recently.  He also denies any trauma to the legs.   He has a history of GERD from which she had developed iron deficiency anemia in June 2020.  He had undergone EGD has a result.  He also had a colonoscopy when he turned 50 years of age and had polyps removed and then had repeat colonoscopy 6 months later.  This evaluation occurred with Dr. of gastroenterology. His colonoscopy was on 12/20/2018.  One of the polyps was a hyperplastic polyp.  The second was a tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia/intramucosal adenocarcinoma, 2 cm size.  Polyps were excised.  Had repeat endoscopy on 7/10/2019 he had a hyperplastic polyp in his rectum.   Also he had a PSA checked in summer 2020.  It was 0.5.   He is a smoker only of very infrequent cigars, perhaps every 6 to 8 months.

Left lower extremity DVT.  Etiology unclear.  No definite provocation.  He did receive a Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine in late February, 2021.  He first noticed a muscle spasm sensation in left calf in mid April, 2021 and then had onset of soreness 2 days before his visit with swelling onset the day of his urgent care visit, 5/20/2021.   Currently on rivaroxaban.  Transitioning now to the 20 mg daily dose.   Family history negative for DVT as is his personal history.  PSA was unremarkable and summer 2020.  Has had prior colonoscopy in December 2018 and June 2019.  Did have finding of sigmoid colon polyps with atypia in 1 and possible noninvasive adenocarcinoma.  Repeat scope showed hyperplastic polyp but no additional polyps.  Has also had EGDs in March 2019 and June 2020 because of GERD and iron lack anemia.  Non-smoker.   I discussed with patient that we would usually treat him for 6 months with anticoagulation and then reassess to determine whether it is safe to discontinue therapy.  But if he has ongoing swelling and soreness in his leg it would be difficult to stop treatment because we would lose one of our early indicators of recurrence of DVT.  I also suggested that we should do a lab panel to assure that he does not have any underlying inherited or acquired abnormality that predispose to this clot, since we do not have any clear-cut causative etiology.  (We discussed that the Covid immunization may have been his predisposition, but that existing data suggest that this is a risk factor in females and that most of the episodes were central nervous system venous clots.)     PLAN:   1.  So we will draw lab panel assessing acquired and inherited predispositions for hypercoagulability.  And we will plan to see him back in a couple of months to reassess his status.

                                                Patient was scheduled for an appointment for a Johnson &amp;Johnson  covid-19 vaccine through a drive thru Thursday April 8, 2021 @12:45pm. We arrived early and he received the vaccine at 12:15pm, waited 30 minutes for reaction and he was feeling fine. Later that same evening, the patient was driving to work on the freeway when he felt a dry throat so he coughed hard, at that cough he felt a massive pain in his head, like his &#34;head was going to explode.&#34; He immediately had tunnel vision closing in on him, so he pulled over and later woke up in our parked car with flashing emergency lights on, parked on the shoulder of the freeway. Disoriented and confused why he was there, he looked at his watch and saw he lost 15 minutes when he had passed out. MY HUSBAND COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED IF HE HAD NOT PULLED HIMSELF OVER WHEN PASSING OUT. Today we reported this to our doctors office and to you!

I went to the emergency room where they performed on ultra sound examination of my left leg.  Confirmed that I have a deep vain thrombosis (DVT) behind my left knee.  Prescribed Eliquis.  Saw Dr. today.  He could not confirm that DVT was caused by vaccine, but I thought I should report it.  I am to stay on Eliquis for six months at which time I will be evaluated for a blood clot disorder.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805029 expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 15-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported. On 15-MAR-2021, the patient received the vaccine, waited at facility for 15 minutes, and everything was okay.  On 17-APR-2021, the patient experienced neck ache, muscle ache and felt a sense of tiredness, headache, sleepiness, which he treated with Aleve (naproxen sodium). He also noticed his feet had a rash from his knee to feet, and according to his sister (who is a healthcare professional) it looked like small micro-embolisms (thrombocytopenia). The patient went to his physician who said the spotty red dots could be petechiae caused by thrombocytopenia.  As recommended by his primary care physician, the patient has an appointment for lab work, including platelet counts, on 20-APR-2021. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from headache, tiredness, neck ache, rash from knee to feet (red dots), muscle ache, and possible thrombocytopenia, and the outcome of sleepiness was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 53-year-old male patient was found to have petechiae-like rash on his knees to feet, that according to attending physician could be caused by thrombocytopenia, 2 days after receiving Janssen COVID-19 vaccine for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The patient underwent laboratory procedure including platelet count (results not reported).  The patient complained of neck ache, muscle ache and felt a sense of tiredness, headache, sleepiness that he treated with Aleve (naproxen sodium) on the day the petechiae-like rash appeared.  No other details reported.  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information as requested.

                                                A 53-yo male patient with a nonsignificant past medical history presented to the hospital with worsening generalized muscle pain, and weakness. Patient reported that he received the Jannsen COVID-19 vaccine 3 weeks prior to admission and symptoms began 8 days later. On the morning of admission the patient also developed pressure-like and pleuritic chest pain.  EKG findings showed ST elevations in V5-V6 with depression in aVL.  D-dimer was found to be elevated however PE evaluation was negative.  Troponins were also found to be elevated. The patient was diagnosed with acute pericarditis and underwent left heart catheterization, selective coronary angiography and left ventriculography. The coronary angiography revealed no significant obstructive coronary artery disease, and left ventriculography revealed normal LV size and function.  Patient was subsequently initiated on colchicine therapy for acute pericarditis. He remains admitted at hospital.

New demyelination w inflammation, new vision problems, dysphagia (permanent). Six days post shot, chest pain started, same as post-virally spring 2020. Chest pain, burning sensation ongoing, presumed carditis. Cardiorespiratory performance beginning to lessen further, beyond last year&#39;s damage. Day of vaccination, about 1-2 min post injection, strong dizziness, balance problems, identical to past allergic reactions to other injectables, but time limited, only an apparent blood pressure problem - passes in its own, heavy caffeination helps reduce the problem, temporary nuisance only &amp; apparently affected a fair number of folks at the site. Chose not to report that issue at the time, since familiar and not serious, only unpleasant.

He came to within seconds of fainting and had not realized he had fainted. An ice pack was given to the patient to hold to his left eyebrow bone (where he hit the ground) in order to reduce swelling. He was guided into a chair and observed for about 20 minutes when he wanted to leave the pharmacy.  The patient felt well shortly after the fall. I checked in with him 2 hours later and he still felt well.

Also experienced some body aches.   Took my temperature via oral thermometer at 10:00 PM and it was 101.5.   Went to bed at approx 11:00 PM wearing all my clothes and under a quilt and two wool blankets.  Chills continued, but then I also began sweating profusely.   I did not rest well and was up approx every hour drinking water and urinating.  I noticed an elevated heart rate for several hours through the night.   cont&#39;d below

                                                On Friday, March 19 around 9:10am I had seizures - loss of awareness, very pale, shaking (but not quite convulsions). This happened before 25 years ago and is likely unrelated to the vaccine. Expected cold/flu-like symptoms did occur on March 14 and part of March 15 but things have been fine since then. I&#39;ve followed up with my GCP and am scheduling a Neuro appointment for followup.

By 9a.m. my blood pressure taken at home was 180/110 and started having chest pain on left side.    Went to urgent care where they felt it was a cardiac reaction to vaccine and they sent me to ER.   Underwent EKG and chest xray.   Blood pressure still at same level 180/110 and not going down, migraine still at an 8 out of 10, chest pain still present.    I was given an IV to treat for migraine pain and within a few hours all symptoms had went away.   We started with Urgent Care at about 10a.m. on 4/3/21 and then by the time all was done I was released from the ER at 6:30p.m. on 4/3/21.

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination I started to experience chronic exhaustion, leg cramping and pain in my lower back right side, upper right thigh, behind my right knee and down into my right calf. I figured that the pain would go away but the pain increased and my leg started swelling and the pain increased making it very difficult for me to put my leg down on the ground and put pressure on my right leg.

                                                Early morning woke up with bad headache, diarrhea throughout the day,  vomited early evening all on Friday April 2nd.  Started to feel better in the evening and started to drink a bit of gatorade.  However Saturday morning April 3rd woke up between 6-7am and went to the bathroom and turned around to walk back out and blacked out - most likely dehydrated.   Fortunately did not fall down as my wife caught me slumped up against the wall and got me down to the floor.  After 5-10 minutes was able to get back to bed and after another hour or so was able to start drinking fluids and keep them down through the day.   By late afternoon/early evening had a small meal and was starting to feel better - never did have a fever (checked frequently on Friday and Saturday)

                                                DIAGNOSIS: 1. Superficial thrombophlebitis MEDICAL DECISION MAKING/DIFFERENTIAL DX: Differential diagnosis includes DVT, superficial thrombophlebitis, muscle strain, tendinitis. The patient presented to the emergency department with atraumatic left leg pain. An ultrasound reveals a fairly large blood clot in the greater saphenous vein. Although this is a superficial clot, given its extent, I think it warrants anticoagulation. Per the trial, the patient would benefit from 45 days of 10 mg Xarelto treatment. The patient was given good precautions regarding bleeding risk while on a blood thinner. He will schedule follow-up appoint with his primary care doctor. He will also use Tylenol and warm packs to help with the discomfort from the superficial thrombophlebitis. He was discharged in satisfactory condition.

He was briefly not aware of his surroundings and felt cool and sweaty to the touch. After a couple minutes, the patient slowly started regaining his mental status and was able to tell us his name, date, and the name of his kids. The EMTs arrived and did a thorough assessment; they determined that because the patient had not had anything to eat or drink all day up until his vaccine appointment, coupled with the fact that the patient had walked 5 minutes to the pharmacy and the weather was warm, the patient&#39;s blood pressure and sugar likely bottomed out and caused him to faint. The patient was given an ice pack to cool down and orange juice to normalize his blood sugar. After waiting in the pharmacy for another 15 minutes, the patient was deemed fit enough to walk back home. He was advised to have something to eat and take a cool shower.

                                                To begin, I have always been a healthy, middle-aged male, with no history at all of neurological problems. What follows is a comprehensive summary of all that happened to me shortly (7 days) after getting the Janssen COVID vaccine and the supporting documentation to support the diagnosis of my having developed Guillian-Barre&#39; Syndrome (GBS) as a direct and obvious consequence of the vaccine.    THURSDAY, 5/13/21: Received the J&amp;J vaccine at 10:00 AM (LOT NUMBER 205A21A).   FRIDAY - THURSDAY, 5/13 - 5/20/21: No obvious reaction to the vaccine, at all.   FRIDAY, 5/21/21: During the day, I noticed deep-muscle pain/soreness in both shoulders (deltoid muscles) that increased throughout the day. It felt as if I had been doing heavy-weight presses with the resulting soreness.  I attributed it to a delayed reaction from the vaccine (as I&#39;d heard muscle pain, particularly in the shoulders, is a common reaction symptom), as I had no injury or other possible cause and chose to ignore it.  It may have even started a day or two before Friday, but wasn&#39;t of such consequence as for me to recall it; the only vivid memory I have is the discomfort on Friday, 5/21/21.   SATURDAY - SUNDAY, 5/22 - 5/23/21: I had continued shoulder pains, but ignored them because they were not acute and just attributed them to a short-term vaccine reaction.   MONDAY, 5/24/21: In the evening, while sitting in the bleachers attending a sporting event, I noticed my buttocks was pretty sore. The bleachers are not normally comfortable, but this was a dull, serious ache across my entire buttocks. I didn&#39;t know to what to attribute it (not yet at that time associating it with the shoulder pain), so ignored it. In retrospect, I realized later that the soreness I was feeling at that time was similar to the shoulder pain and was the pain felt from a deep numbness across the buttocks, akin to when a body part (hand, foot, etc) &#34;falls asleep&#34; so deeply that it&#39;s numb, but is still very, very sore.  Later that night, my upper back began to feel sore, from shoulder to shoulder, down to my mid-back. As the night progressed, this pain increased exponentially to a &#34;Level 10&#34;, leaving me unable to sleep but in 15-minute increments, wandering the house to find a spot -- sofa, chair, floor, anywhere -- to give me some comfort to sleep; I slept 2 hours, total, that night.  The pain across my back felt equivalent to someone beating me with a baseball bat all over my upper back -- it wasn&#39;t an acute, localized pain, but very deep and broad across the area.  Normally, Aleve quickly resolves any pain issues I have, but overnight, it did nothing to reduce the pain.   TUESDAY, 5/25/21: I began to piggyback Aleve and Extra Strength Tylenol, and that seemed to help abate a little of the most intense pain, but it was still painful and precluded sleep and much of my working.  I think it was at this time that I began to notice the pain and numbness going beyond my buttocks, down the backs of my legs, and into my feet, leaving my feet (and toes, in particular) numb and tingling.  I also began to notice a problem with balance and gross motor controls (stumbling when walking, nearly falling several times in the shower) -- all symptoms I have never experienced in any capacity.  Additionally, I had considerable pain down the backs of my legs, leading me to feel as if my calves and hamstrings had been through a heavy workout the day before and desperately needed stretching -- however, any attempts to do so led to excruciating, stabbing pains in those muscles.  I also noticed that the pain in my upper back was becoming more acute and localized in my cervical vertebrae area. Having taken care of a father who has had many back surgeries and suspecting I have my own degenerative cervical disc issues (I&#39;ve had past neck pains), I began to believe that all the pain and numbness throughout my body might be due to a cervical issue (e.g., bulging disc, stenosis, etc), and so tried to treat the area as such, with hot shower, heating pad, better neck support, etc.  I continued to piggyback the two pain meds that day, but the upper back and neck pain and numbness and gross motor issues came back in full that night, again leaving me no relief for sleep -- I could only doze in 15-minute increments and found no position or place to sleep that was comfortable; I was in tremendous pain  10) across my entire back and down my legs. By 2:00 AM, I knew there was going to be no relief, and I couldn&#39;t wait until the morning; I drove myself to the nearby ER, again still believing/expecting at the time that this was a spinal issue.  In the ER, I was met by a PA who reviewed my situation, determined that cervical imaging was unnecessary, and prescribed Percocet.  My blood pressure was recorded at 160/94. I was released after two hours and returned home.  Despite the meds, I was still in considerable pain that night and found myself unable to sleep in more than 10- to 15-minute increments.   WEDNESDAY, 5/26/21: During the day, the Percocet seemed to abate the pain, somewhat, although it tended to flare up much more at night during the prior 2 nights, anyway.  However, I noticed I had an upset stomach by midday, and as the day progressed, the pain in my abdomen grew considerably. By the evening, the pain across my abdomen was unbearable, as bad as it was in my back and legs. Late in the evening, I researched Percocet and saw that abdominal pain and nausea are two prominent side effects.  I stopped taking the pain medication immediately, knowing that my back pain would return in full through the night; again, I slept in 15-minute increments in considerable back and abdominal pain for a total of about 3 hours.  It was also during the day Wednesday that I noticed considerably worse gross motor skills (e.g., walking, ascending/descending stairs, standing up straight, writing), balance, and increased numbness and tingling in my legs, feet, and hands. At one point, I tried to walk by my daughter in a hallway in the house, and in trying to go around her, I fell against the wall. She thought I was joking; I wasn&#39;t. It happened several more times that week.  Also, this day or the next, I started noticing additional problems with urinating and defecating. It felt as though I had no control over my abdominal muscles, so could not strain or push when going to the bathroom. When trying to have a bowel movement -- and I knew needed to -- I felt as though I had no control to push; when urinating, I had no muscle support for pushing out the urine.   THURSDAY, 5/27/21: Still believing these pain, numbness, and other neurological, problems to be related to cervical vertebrae/disc issues, I had an appointment with a spine orthopedist. He ordered cervical X-Rays and confirmed that I do have disc compression/degeneration, but not excessive and nothing that could explain the pain and numbness persisting all over my back, down to my hands, across my buttocks, and down my legs to my feet. The message: the cervical discs were not the problem.  This is when I reconsidered all I had been through, tying back to the initial pain I felt in my shoulders the prior Friday. This is when I realized that my body had been reacting to the vaccine. Never before in my life had I had neurological problem. Never before had I experienced pain, numbness, and tingling across my entire body that way, so until that moment, I hadn&#39;t considered the vaccine to be a possible vector for all that was going on with me.  The coincidence of these events was FAR too great to be anything but a causal relationship. The likelihood of these symptoms arising on their own is infinitesimal in comparison to a causal effect. The vaccine had triggered a serious and painful neurological response in my body.  The orthopedist, knowing I had responded poorly to the Percocet, prescribed oxycodone. I took that pain medicine that day and into the evening, but once again, my stomach and abdomen began to bother me and the abdominal pain returned. Once again, I looked at the side effects of the medicine, and the first two I saw were stomach pain and nausea. I stopped taking the pain medicine immediately. That night, I slept a total of 2.5 hours.   FRIDAY, 5/28/21: I was still in considerable pain, and that combined with very little sleep (and none of it good) for 4 days led me to having trouble thinking clearly. My wife insisted I needed to go back to the ER in the morning to see what could be going on. My blood pressure upon being seen was initially approximately 185/140, but what was finally recorded after a second test was 191/112. I waited to be seen for about 2 hours, but I finally met with the ER physician and described my history of problems that week, including my then-belief that this was a vaccine reaction. She ordered full bloodwork, chest X-Ray and CT scans (without contrast) of lumbar and thoracic spine and CT scan with contrast of chest/abdomen. Nothing strikingly abnormal was found in these scans, but doctors (ER physician and neurologist) noted bliteral weakness in lower and upper body. The doctors wanted to order MRIs, but I am unable to have an MRI due to a piece of metal in my left eye. The morphine I was administered helped reduce my pain and my blood pressure upon leaving had abated, somewhat (don&#39;t recall my final BP). Both doctors seemed not to believe that these symptoms could be the result of an adverse vaccine reaction, but they were unable to explain a cause. On my inquiry, at my friend&#39;s recommendation I ask to verify, the neurologist disagreed that these were symptoms of a presentation of Guillian-Barre&#39; Syndrome (GBS). The ER doctor asked if I was interested in being admitted, but I felt some of my more extreme symptoms (blood pressure and pain -- thanks to the morphine) had abated sufficiently to allow me to leave. After 8 hours in the ER, I left and returned home.  My numbness, tingling, some pain, balance, and motor skills issues persisted, but were blunted somewhat (probably from the morphine?). It was either this day or the next, that I was standing outside, and knowing I had problems walking and with balance, I decided to try to run a few steps to see how weak my legs were and bad my motor skills and balance were. Immediately, it was clear that things were worse than I had considered. I had very poor control of my legs -- they flew off to the sides, out of control, as I tried to step; I stumbled a couple times and almost fell; and I couldn&#39;t proceed in a straight line, veering off at an angle. I earnestly tried several times, with the same results each time.  That night, while the pain was still there, it was tolerable enough that I was able to sleep for a total of about 5 hours.   SATURDAY, 5/29/21: Early in the AM, I noticed I was unable to smile. Having a friend who had had Bell&#39;s Palsy, I recognized the signs immediately. The left side of my face sagged, I was unable to smile (left side of my mouth sagged), and I was unable to close my left eye. My wife took me to the ER, and we were met by the same ER physician who had seen me the day before. She was shocked about my return so soon after my prior visit. My blood pressure, on being admitted, was 151/102, but as with my other visits, asymptomatic other than the problems described before (pain, numbness, and tingling, in my back, arms, legs, and abdomen; gross motor movement; lack of coordination; and lack of clarity in thinking); no other signs of infection or illness. The Dr ordered a CT scan (without contrast) of my head and other bloodwork. Of note, the CK came back at 712 U/L. The CT scan came back normal. Again, I was administered morphine, which abated my pain and allowed me to relax. After 3 hours, I was released, with prescriptions for Amlodipine for the high blood pressure and Prednisone and Valtrex (Valacyclovir) for the Bell&#39;s Palsy.  The morphine helped reduce my back and abdominal pain and give me some comfort, such that I could sleep another 5 hours that night, although all other symptoms persisted.   SUNDAY - WEDNESDAY, 5/30/21 - 6/2/21: I continued to experience the numbness and tingling in my back (primarily), abdomen, legs/feet, and arms/hands, but my severe pain began to abate, such that I could sleep a bit more easily. I taped my eye shut at night, as my Bell&#39;s Palsy eyelid would not close fully, and it teared constantly.   WEDNESDAY, 6/2/21: Not having a GP, I finally found an Internist to review my case and symptoms, but primarily to extend my meds (Blood Pressure and antiviral and steroid for the Bell&#39;s Palsy), as the ER doctor had only given me a 5-day prescription. The doctor review my situation and continued the meds. Having been prompted regularly by my friend to confirm a GBS diagnosis, I asked this doctor about a possible GBS-vaccine link and after a cursory review, he said he did not think so.   THURSDAY, 6/3/21: With the weakness in my left eyelid, my desire to find a resolution to it, and my concerns about its effect on my vision, I had an appointment with my opthamologist, who recommended eye drops until the eye improved and instructed me to stop taping the eye shut. She noted no other problems with my vision.   FRIDAY - MONDAY, 6/4/21 - 6/7/21: During this time, the medicines for my Bell&#39;s Palsy seemed to take effect, and the paralysis symptoms abated mostly (with some residual weakness in my left eyelid).  I continued to experience the other neurological symptoms, however.   TUESDAY, 6/8/21: Having been unable to get a timely appointment with a trusted neurologist, a friend with a contact at medical school head of neurology was able to get me an appointment with a neurology faculty member. I met with Dr. that afternoon, and he was the first to really listen to the symptoms I had and understand some of the possible triggers and consequences of them. I started the conversation explaining that I&#39;m a reasonable, rational, and science-based person, an engineer by training and career, and that I firmly believed all the symptoms I was presenting were a direct consequence of my getting the vaccine.  Additionally, at my friend&#39;s continued urging, I asked if these symptoms could point to a Guillian-Barre&#39; diagnosis.  He was at first skeptical of my proposition of the vaccine cause, but was quick to say he was glad I had raised the question of GBS, because he had that diagnosis in mind, as I discussed my symptoms.  He believed that the symptoms I had and the way and speed with which they had progressed pointed to a likely GBS diagnosis.  He scheduled a follow-on appointment to have an Electromyogram (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Study to assess the extent of the neurological damage and prognosis for resolution, as I am unable to get an MRI and he seemed to feel a lumbar puncture was unnecessary.    FRIDAY, 6/11/21: I had my scheduled EMG and Nerve Conduction Study with Dr. The results showed some abnormal neuropathy, but mostly normal in my extremities and indicative of some recovery from symptoms. Although I still had considerable numbness, tingling, and some pain down my legs into my feet and down my arms into my hands, my most prevalent issues at that point were numbness and tingling across my entire upper back and abdomen, but the doctor indicated these tests don&#39;t identify issues very well, that they are better designed for testing neurological issues in the extremities. We agreed to reconvene over the phone in several weeks, unless problems worsened.   TUESDAY, 6/29/21:   During a follow-up appointment with the doctor, I indicated that some of my neurological issues were abating and that my blood pressure had returned to near-normal range.  My energy was returning to a degree and my motor skills and balance and control had improved.  However, I continued to have significant numbness and tingling across my back and abdomen, and of greater concern, I had increasing tingling and pain going down my left arm to my index finger when I stretched out my arm.  This was a new symptom and increased in pain in frequency in the following days and raises the question of what other symptoms might arise.    AS OF 7/8/21:  CURRENT STATUS: I have continued numbness and tingling in my feet and hands and back and abdomen, although they are reduced from their earlier state. However, I have increased shooting pain in my left index finger when stretching out my left arm. Additionally, I have a mild increase in weakness in my left eyelid, after prior improvement from the Bell&#39;s Palsy. My dangerously high blood pressure at the early onset of these symptoms has returned to near-normal levels, although my GP continues to keep on blood pressure medicine (Amlodopine) for now. Finally, a lot of the issues I had thinking clearly and regularly making mental mistakes, all noticeable and commented on by my family, have lessened, although I still find myself making mental mistakes and forgetting information that would have been MUCH less likely prior to this adverse GBS event caused by the J&amp;J vaccine.

                                                I shortly after the shot I having had random pains in arm, including joints [like when the pressure changes ... don&#39;t think I have arthritis]) but they only lasted a few minutes and then would go away.  About 10 hours later I started feeling sick.  One of the first things I noticed besides a headache was my heart rate jumped up to over 100 beats per minute (it is normally below 84).  I started getting chills and fever.  It was worse than any flu fever I ever had and I could not sleep.  Worst part was my heart rate would not go down, remaining above 100 but below 110-115 beats per minute.  I considered calling 911 but after looking online decided not to as long as it remained below 120 bpm.  I don&#39;t know my maximum temperature - I did not think to take it until after the peak had passed by 20 minutes or so (was 99.4 at that point - normal temperature runs 97.2 (low 96.8, high 98.2)).  Heart rate finally started to drop around 3:30 am.

BP had gone down some, so they agreed to proceed. After dose, pt was dizzy, sweaty, unresponsive for a short time. Once he was more responsive, we helped him sit on the floor against the wall as he was quite dizzy. We called 911 and pt refused transport to hospital, but was evaluated.

He said he was dizzy. He was at this point dizzy, pale, sweating, low heart rate in the 30&#39;s. We put a cold wet rag on the back of his neck and monitored. We gave him some cold water also. Slowly over the next 5-10 minutes his stats got better, color returned, and was not sweating anymore. He did not feel dizzy anymore.  We monitored for an additional 30 minutes. Gave instructions. Sent home with spouse.

He went home and  laid down and fell asleep.  When he woke up he called his PCP because he wasn&#39;t feeling well.  His heart rate was running from 80-90 and fluctuating like he was about to have a heart attack. He was told to call back if he wasn&#39;t feeling better.  On 4/9  his heart  was running about 90-115.  On 4/10 his heart was running from 139-142.  He called his doctors office and they told him to go to the ER.  He went to hospital.   He was given heart  EKG, labs  and IV.  He was given aspirin.  His INR was at 2.  His heart rate came down to 115.   His blood was low.  His DX was Sinus Tachycardia.  He was admitted to the Heart Floor.  He was treated for 2 days and released.  They told him they thought he was reacting to taking the vaccination and to FU w/ PCP.  He said his heart rate is fluctuating  and is currently at 101.  He doesn&#39;t see a Cardiologist since he cannot have open heart surgery due to his underlying health conditions.

                                                Approximately eight hours after receiving the shot, I started getting a headache, body aches, and chills (April 3rd, 8 p.m.).  I went to bed and had severe chills and body sweats for the entire night.  The primary symptom to report is that my heart raced all night.  It felt like it was beating at about 140 to 150 Hz or higher.  When I woke up in the morning, it felt like my chest had been pounded on all night.  The pain was in my sternum area.  The headache and body aches took a little over a day to go away.  The chest pain took a couple of days to die down.  On April 12th, I walked my dogs in the morning and felt out of breath, which isn&#39;t normal for me.  In the afternoon, while working at my desk at home, I started getting more and more severe chest pain and then started getting dizzy and felt weak.  I drove myself to the local ER and they tested me for a heart attack.  All tests came back negative.  They suggested going to another facility to get checked for clots or to make an appointment with a cardiologist.  The next day, after talking to a doctor friend, he suggested going to the ER facility to get imaged for clots and to get fully checked out.  No cardiologist appointments were available till the next week.  I went to the ER facility and was there for seven hours getting tested.  They came back and said all test results were negative and that my heart looked fine.  They did not have any suggestions for what might be causing the pain in my chest.

                                                On March 28th, started noticing symptoms. There was pain in my entire right leg, shin swelling; calf- swelling and skin discoloration; and right foot - swelling. On 4/1, I went to Urgent Care where I was seen, evaluated and treated by Dr. She ordered blood tests and an ultrasound within 20 minutes. I had 4 blood clots in 3 veins in my right leg/DVT. My blood platelet value was 267 and the standard range is 130 to 400. They didn&#39;t consider it low, but it&#39;s still an issue. I was given an injection of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection--1 ml injection twice a day for 5 days, which was started in the ER. I then switched to Pradaxa 150mg pill twice a day. I took that until around the 6th of this month when I noticed my right leg had gotten worse. I was instructed to go back to the urgent care. Another ultrasound was ordered and it showed I still had the 4 blood clots in 3 veins that seems to have worsened, so the meds were not working. He consulted with a vascular surgeon and they put me back on the injection once a day, which I am currently still on. I was told to follow up with my PCP in two weeks and that appt is on Thursday with Dr.

Then a few seconds later he appeared to lost consciousness, his head fell back, and he started to have jerking movements.   He was making noises that almost sounded like a snore to me right at first, but it was more than likely him gagging on saliva.  911 was called, and his symptoms continued for roughly 30-60 seconds.  EMS took him to hospital where they diagnosed it as vasovagal syncope and just gave him some fluids.

No clear cause of the PE was found. It was thought to be possibly related to superficial thrombosis of his upper extremity secondary to IV that was placed 2 days prior when he was briefly admitted for workup of heavy hematocheiza, at which time he was found to have a mild anemia and discharged. He was treated inpatient at Hospital. I am not sure of the where he obtained the vaccine or the exact date.

                                                Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID Vaccine EUA J&amp;J Dose 4/9/21 NOT COVID POSITIVE  5/25/21: The patient is a 55-year-old male presents to the emergency department via EMS today after calling 911 with acute shortness of breath and being found unresponsive and pulseless at home, subsequently requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation on route to the ED.  the patient has a past medical history significant for gout, which he takes indomethacin as needed, and recently went to another state in March.  His significant other reports that COVID-19 infection went throughout the house in December, although he did test negative, they believe he had it due to his symptoms.  He did have that Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccination at the beginning of April of this year. Apparently the patient was speaking with the 1st responder right up until for minutes prior to EMS arrival and when fire department arrived on the scene the patient was found unresponsive, pulseless, and apneic, and subsequently they performed 1 round of CPR administering epinephrine and Narcan, when the patient regained a pulse.  The patient lost a pulse again, requiring subsequent CPR and airway tube was placed.   The patient arrived in the ED at 10:02 a.m., epinephrine was administered x7 rounds, patient was intubated with a 7.5 ET tube, Lucas device on patient, at 1053 the patient was awake, opening his eyes, squeezing nursing staff hand. At 10:59 a.m., nursing staff reported patient trying to pull his ET tube out.  The patient received at least 1 hour 15 minutes CPR including time on scene, on route to ED, and in ED.  At 11:10 a.m. patient&#39;s O2 saturation decreased to 79%, patient became diaphoretic with decreased responsiveness.  At 11:13 a.m., cardiology was at the bedside.  The patient&#39;s laboratory studies were significant for platelets 44, INR 1.2, CO2 16, AGAP 24, glucose 475, BUN 17, CR 1.55, ALT 248, AST 274, ALP 123, mg 2.9, lactate 15, troponin negative, 1st ABG:  PH 7.11, pCO2 39.4, base excess -17, PO2 46, HC03 12.6, O2 saturation 100%.  EKG showed right bundle-branch block with ST elevation in lead 3, V1, V2, V3, and V4 leads with ST depression in 1, aVL, and lead II.  Limited stat bedside echo showed akinetic septum and hypokinetic right ventricle.  The patient was taken to the cath lab.  Dr.  completed a pulmonary arteriogram and found bilateral massive emboli subsequently undergoing thrombectomy.  Patient was on epinephrine, norepinephrine, IV fluids, heparin, and propofol.   The patient was seen postprocedure in the intensive care unit while mechanically ventilated and sedated.  The patient&#39;s sedation was stopped and the patient woke up, moved all extremities, and followed some commands.  The patient&#39;s significant other was at the bedside.  He is currently on norepinephrine at 20mcg/min, epinephrine 20mcg/min, heparin per PE protocol after receiving bolus in CCL, propofol 25mcg/kg/min, and IV NS fluids.  The patient&#39;s wife reports that he has a history of chewing tobacco, but quit over 20 years ago.  She believes that he has a family history of blood clots in his sister&#39;s and maybe his dad, but she is not completely sure about that.  6/8/21: 56-year-old man who called EMS with complaints of acute onset shortness breath, was found unresponsive, apneic and without a pulse on arrival of EMS. ACLS protocol was initiated, he was brought to the emergency department where CPR was continued with Lucas device. He was intubated, required administration of 7 rounds of epinephrine, a total of 1 arm 15 minutes of resuscitation was required prior to return of spontaneous CT circulation. Cardiology was emergently consulted, he was taken to the cath had last cath lab with only mild nonobstructive CAD noted. He then underwent pulmonary angiography with the finding of saddle pulmonary embolism as well as bilateral main pulmonary artery thrombosis. He underwent mechanical thrombectomy of the right and left main pulmonary trunk, right upper middle old and lower lobe pulmonary artery, left lower lobe pulmonary artery.  Therapeutic anticoagulation was initiated with IV heparin then transition to oral Eliquis.    He was treated with empiric antibiotic therapy for presumed aspiration pneumonia. Tunneled hemodialysis catheter was placed secondary to legal Rhea and acute kidney injury, renal replacement therapy was initiated with CRRT. Clinical response was favorable, he was subsequently extubated and transitioned to intermittent hemodialysis. He was assessed by Physical and Occupational therapy and recommended for acute rehabilitation placement. His been discharged today in stable medical condition to continue hemodialysis as scheduled per Nephrology at the acute rehabilitation unit.

                                                Day one was headache as expected and right arm pain. Day two I had bad headache (9) joint pain in my shoulder and hips, loud ringing ears. shortness of breathe, left lung pain. This repeated for three days so I tested by BP and found it to be 160/130. Past day 3 I started with adrenaline spikes where heart would race up and I felt like hulk and blood pressure spikes out of the random. 5/24/21, I saw my family doctor and since my BP was so random high and then low she did not want to give me meds since it could drops too low at time. For my difficulty breathing and lung pain she gave me an prescription inhaler. As of today I still have the ringing left ear, shoulder joint pain like a pin stuck in it and unable to raise over my head without using my left arm to support, high BP on average 140/132. 167/151, 126/89, 122/91,110/87, 126/84 are some examples. These at the lowest is 10&#43; point higher than my normal range of 120s over 70s. Headache continues but may be due to the higher than normal BP.

                                                I started to suffer from a numbness in my left hand that radiated into a deep pain and increasingly became intense. That pain radiated up to my shoulder and into the left quadrant of my chest. I started experiencing shortness of breath and a hypersensitivity to the heat. I went to Hospital ER and they ran a bunch of tests. I was diagnosed with a blood clot in my arm. I was given Eliquis. I was on that medication for about 2 weeks and after my second week of being on Eliquis, I started to suffer from the same symptoms. I decided to go to the Hospital. When I went there they admitted me and ran through blood tests to check for a heart attack or stroke or anything relating to the pain I was experiencing. Now I am back home and I am still taking Eliquis. As of today, I am still experiencing the symptoms. The symptoms are mild, but it&#39;s still scary. I would like to add that I have had an increase in dietary intolerance.

On April 5, 2021, I went from the urgent care to the ER to having a catheter inserted into my wrist at local hospital, because they thought I was having a heart attack. Turns out I have myocardial bridging of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. I am not in pain, thankfully, but these symptoms persist. Are they being magnified by the vaccine? No one seems to know. What I do know is that since receiving the vaccine I feel this tightness in my chest and it&#39;s not going away.

                                                My health was great before my vaccine. I was able to have a normal full day five days out of the first 60 without health issues. This week I haven&#39;t had one day where I haven&#39;t had something going on.  I woke up day after vaccination and started feeling feverish, but going into bad chills, extreme headache, a different kind of headache than my migraines, abdominal had pain, heart rate and breathing, heart rate was elevated, breathing not normal, out of breath, deep pain right thigh at bone, did not bruise. I called cardiologist 03/25/2021, about thigh, thought it might be DVT, I followed up 03/29/2021 since I did not hear back, we spoke on the 30th, I had very high blood pressure, doc presumed I had a tress fracture of right thigh bone and that other things were related to my chronic intro viruses. I saw my infectious disease doctor on April 13th he said this could be a major conflict with either current viruses, meds taking in conjunction with vaccination. All of my major lymph nodes were inflamed. I do have non Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma, but they told me it is slow growing. Visited ER on 04/14/2021. Dr met me there.

He had noted BLE weakness during his admission and noted worsening of his weakness following his discharge. He returned to the ER on 7/8 but left AMA. He presented to ER on 7/9 with right arm and BLE weakness and MRI showed numerous small acute ischemic foci bilaterally. CTA was negative for significant stenosis or occlusion. He was evaluated by Neurology and felt that there was a high likelihood of cardioembolism as the etiology of his strokes vs cocaine. They recommended cardiac monitoring for evidence of afib as well as DAPT x 21 days followed by ASA monotherapy. He was noted to have an elevated troponin on admission and was placed on a Heparin drip. Cardiology did not feel that repeat cardiac cath was warranted. An Echo with bubble study was performed and showed EF 45-50%, diffuse hypokinesia, mild DD and no evidence of shunting. He has been accepted at hospital with plan for transfer there today.

                                                PT BP WAS LOW AFTER BEING ADMINISTERED THE VACCINE. THIS REACTION WAS NOT STATED TO BE COMMON PRIOR TO RECIEVING THE VACCINE BUT PT&#39;S WIFE STATING AFTER HE RECEIVED IT THAT HIS BLOOD PRESSURE IS LOW EVERY TIME HE HAS A SHOT. SO MONITORED THE BLOOD PRESSURE, HIS WIFE GAVE HIM CRACKERS AND WATER, AND WE HELPED HIM LAY BACK. PT BLOOD PRESSURE DID RETURN TO NORMAL AFTER THAT AND WE CONTINUED TO MONITOR HIM FOR ABOUT A HOUR AND A HALF. PT APPARENTLY HAS THIS KIND OF REACTION AFTER EVERY VACCINE AND IS NOTHING SPECIFICALLY TO DO WITH THE COVID SHOT. HE WAS EVENETUALLY FEELING BETTER AND THEY REFUSED TO LET ME CALL AN AMBULANCE SO WE HELPED HIM TO HIS CAR IN A PUSH CART AND THEY LEFT.

                                                First 4 hours post injection no serious side effects, slight headache was settling in.  At approx. 8PM (7 hours after shot) I had fairly a severe reaction of horror for the next 16 hours - all night long.  Heart racing/energy beyond, deep chills and severe whole body shaking to the point of my back going out (dont&#39; have a bad back), fever, migraine headache so bad (i dont get headaches) and body aches from a horror movie.   I&#39;m a jock, run daily, healthy, no smoke, drink or drugs. This lasted all night long well into the morning. At 3Am i considered going to the ER, but didnt. By 2pm the following day most of it went away. Two days later (today) i am dizzy, heart feels fast or racing, naseuous earlier , and exhausted. I can deal with it now, but it&#39;s very uncomfortable. Frankly, I regret getting the vaccine, wish i had not.   I had covid last March, it was no big deal beyond what a flu would have done...with some shortness of breath on and off for a few months. The reaction to the vaccine is viccious compared to covid itself (for me, just my experience). Hope this all stops and goes away.   Thank you for your work!

Duration of blackout unknown. Woke up on floor not knowing how I got there. Sat up, nausea and lightheadedness returned, then dissipated with no further blackout. Felt rush of blood from head to toe and felt okay after that. Pharmacy staff took blood pressure, readings were close to normal (slightly elevated). Paramedics were called by pharmacy, and their BP readings were also close to normal. After all that, aside from some fatigue, no other appreciable side effects over the next 48 hours. No nausea, flu-like symptoms or fever, and very little soreness at injection site.

Slurring words, stumbling around and general unwell feeling with a fluttery feeling in chest. No previous heart issues of any kind. After it continued for an hour or so, I took him to the ER and it was discovered that he was in AFIB. 2 rounds of meds and tests, but stayed in that rhythm. They ended up doing a cardio version and it went back into normal sinus rhythm. Follow up with dr, placed on Eliquis, EKG, stress test and sleep study have found no other contributing factors atthis point.

My PCP scheduled an ultrasound on 3-24-21 where the nurse discovered blood clots in my lower left leg. I started taking Eloquis later that afternoon. I then had an apt with a blood dr. on 4-9-21 where she drew blood for tests. I was experiencing my heart racing and she scheduled me an apt with a cardiologist on 4-13-21 where the cardiologist suspected that the clots had moved into my lungs. The cardiologist did an EKG on the same day. I have a heart echo scheduled for 5-7-21. I am experiencing side effects from Eloquis so 4-19-21 I switched to Xeralto.

I went into my kitchen and all of a sudden I started feeling dizzy. I lost all strength in my legs and in my left arm. I really couldn&#39;t move my arms or my legs and I felt really light headed. I had to have my 5 year old boys get me some water to drink. My son noticed that my heart was beating really strong and really fast. I saw water boiling over in the pot on the stove and I couldn&#39;t even get out of a chair to turn it off. I couldn&#39;t stand up. I finally managed to go back by my bed from the chair and slowly moved around. I tried holding my phone and it dropped out of my hands a couple of times because I couldn&#39;t hold it. A couple hours later, I felt a little better, but I had to fight to get around. We fell asleep and when I woke up, I still felt bad. I took my children to school and told them that I was going to the hospital to get checked out. At the hospital they performed multiple tests and they back showing I had stroke. I was treated for suffering from a stroke.

                                                Approximately 4 minutes after the injection, while sitting down, I felt light headed, sweating, weak, face turned white. I was close to passing out but didn&#39;t. I requested attention after about 10 minutes. While being treated by medics they mentioned color had returned to my face. I felt better enough so I refused to go to hospital and was driven home. Later that morning, 03/08/2021 about 10 AM, I developed a fever and body aches with sharp pains thru out my body and joints. First temperature check was 100.5. My fever, pains/weakness increased thru out that day and overnight with chills. Highest temp check was 102.8 that evening prior to bedtime. I don&#39;t know if it could have been higher at some point overnight. It felt like I had a moderate to bad case of the FLU. The next morning, 03/09/2021 the fever broke down to about 101. By 03/11/2021, aside from a little residual weakness I felt more like myself. However, as of the writing of this report my temp seems to fluctuate between normal and 99.8. Will report this to my Doctor on next visit. Worth noting that I haven&#39;t had any Flu like symptoms to that degree in many years.

Then, without warning, I passed out, while driving on the freeway. Fortunately, I did not hit anyone, or was hit by anyone, and must have bounced off guardrails after crossing traffic twice and going off the freeway into the middle of an off ramp, where I finally came to. I did not suffer any injuries in the accident.

I was subjected to a series of tests including: EKG, ECHO, Platelet Cnt, Lipid Panel w direst LDL reflex, Hemoglobin, MRI Brain w/o contrast, CTA Stroke Alert (head/neck), CT Stroke Alert Brain, ECG, Basic Metabolic Panel, CBC, Protime - INR, APTT, Troponin I, Covid19, Influenz Influenza A/B, RSV PCR, and POCT GLUCOSE. I was kept for observation and determined I had suffered a small stroke. Released from the hospital 4/7/2021.

                                                After a week (7 days) I noticed I was short of breath and my heart was racing most of the day.  I had my blood pressure checked for several days by the school nurse.  The readings were very high 158 over 102 at the start of school and 168 over 104 at the end of the day.  This was constant for a week before I went to the cardiologist for a check up.   The doctor prescribed Amlodipine Besylate 5mg on March 26, 2021 to lower my blood pressure.  It took roughly 10 days to get my blood pressure down to 140 over 85.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included pollen allergy, alcohol user (not often), and non-smoker, and he had no chronic medical history. He did not have any drug abuse/illicit drug use.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 203A21A, and expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total, administered on 09-APR-2021 on left arm for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported. After vaccination on 10-APR-2021 (Saturday), he was feeling bad and 11-APR-2021 (Sunday) and 8 days later went to the hospital. He did a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) covid-19 test at the hospital on 16-April-2021 and result was positive. He went back home but on 28-APR-2021, because his oxygen levels dropped and had trouble breathing. He was ventilated for 18 days. He was hospitalized for Covid-19 pneumonia (pneumonia, feeling bad and lost 45 pounds) for 36 days. He was discharged from hospital on 03-JUN-2021. On an unspecified date, he was not able to walk. He had home therapy and nursing therapy to be able to walk again and he lost 45 pounds. Since unspecified date, he could not work for 3 months.  The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from covid-19 pneumonia on 03-JUN-2021, and dependence on ventilator, and could not work, and had not recovered from not able to walk. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Life Threatening). This report was associated with product quality complaint: 90000182426. The suspected product quality complaint has been confirmed to be not voided. The patient received the vaccine on 09-APR-2021 and had a positive Covid-19 test on 16-APR-2021 with 7 days elapsed between vaccination and test. There was not sufficient time elapsed for the patient to achieve immunity; therefore this report was not considered a lack of effect for Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: 20210622074-covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2. s-Covid 19 Pneumonia, Dependence on Ventilator.

                                                This is a 59 year old male that presented to the emergency department at approximately 1447 on 04/27/2021 with sudden onset of left upper and lower extremity weakness and left-sided numbness of his face. The patient stated he may have had some weakness the previous night (04/26/2021), but mostly noticed it when he woke up around 0900 on 04/27/2021. The patient stated he may have also had some transient speech changes which he felt were improved upon emergency department presentation. The patient stated he took an 81 mg aspirin prior to hospital arrival. The patient was overall hemodynamically stable in the emergency department. Past medical history is only significant for benign prostatic hyperplasia. This patient has no history of previous CVA or TIA, no smoking history, no history of clotting disorders, no recent trauma or other injury. CT head revealed a small right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage with no midline shift and concern for clot. CTA head and neck perfusion study was significant for ?perfusion abnormality involving the right frontal lobe in the region of known subarachnoid hemorrhage, likely related to dural venous sinus thrombosis involving the posterior aspect of the superior sagittal sinus, left greater than right transverse sinus, and left sigmoid sinus.? This patient is noted to have recently received his Johnson and Johnson vaccine on 03/20/2021. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Neurology and hematology were consulted.

                                                Patient had stated that he tended to pass out after giving blood.  After shot was given pharmacist stayed with patient in case something happened.  Patient almost immediately said he didn&#39;t feel right.  Patient started to lose color and was very hot. Pharmacist got up and stayed next to patient.  Patient slowly lowered  his head and started to breathe heavily.  Pharmacy technician then came over with a cool towel to place on patients head. The pharmacist couldn&#39;t tell if patient had in fact passed out because patients head was down and pharmacist was holding patient in place so he didn&#39;t fall.  The pharmacy tech was asked if patient passed out and she saw his eyes were open.  Patient then asked how long he was out for.  That was for a total of roughly 5 seconds.  Patient then stayed at pharmacy for around 45 minutes.  He regained his color and his body temp returned to normal.  He did say he was drowsy but felt he was fine to go home.  Patient was called later in the day and he said he was drowsy but feeling much better.
