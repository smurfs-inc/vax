The next day I was very weak and tired. The chills and fever faded the next afternoon.

                                                Approximately seven minutes after the patient received the Janssen COVID vaccine, he had called out to his wife/pharmacy technician at the pharmacy stating he did not feel well.  His head had fallen back and his eyes were starting to roll back into his head. Patient had saliva starting to foam at the corner of his mouth and it appeared to be the onset of a mild seizure (per wife, patient has had seizure once before after a head injury) and he was turning very pale. Patient seemed to be unresponsive at that time - not answering to questions. At this point, one of the pharmacists ran to the clinic to get help and the other pharmacist administered an Epi-pen to patient&#39;s thigh.  Patient immediately came around after the injection, looked up and began talking. Staff called 911 and patient was monitored by pharmacy and clinic staff.  When the paramedics arrived, the patient was doing better and was able to ride home with his wife.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after the patient received his vaccination, he rested his head on the wall behind him in the chair he was being observed in and passed out and turned white. His wife began slapping his face and screaming his name and the observer called for me. I arrived within seconds and assisted his wife in moving him from the floor to the chair. Within seconds of getting his head to the ground safely, he came back to and was very sweaty, red in the face. He stayed on the ground laying down, and then sitting for approximately 25 minutes. During that time, he told us that he had previously passed out during 3 procedures done at doctors offices.  We got him an ice pack and a orange pop as he was complaining of being hot and having only eaten a granola bar all day. He was able to get up to a chair and sat there for an additional 5 minutes, before he was able to walk out on his own accord. I have spoken with the patient twice since, once last evening and once today and he reports he feels great now besides the expected body aches from the vaccination.

                                                Heart racing the next day after vaccination. I went for a walk in the park and i noticed my hear rate jumped up to 165bpm on my fitbit for a period of time even though i just began walking. I wasnt running or anything. I was foggy and very jittery. I also experienced the same symptoms today, 4.12.21 while also heading for a short walk. Im an athlete and in great shape and ive never had my heart jump to 165bpm just walking. That would happen normally after a sprint or long run, but not just walking.

Once on the freeway I felt dizzy.  This came on me very fast.  I thought I better get off at the next exit.. but instantly blacked out.  While unconscious I struck another vehicle going approximatley 65mph, rolled my vehicle on its side, skidded, then rolled back upright.  I awoke to my car spun sideways on the freeway, paramedics, and fire dept working the wreck from my window, and no recollection of what happend.  It felt instantaneous to me.    I ate a breakfast of granola, yoguirt.  I hydrated before the shot.  I even took extra Vitamin C.

Sonner I felt a slight headache and from time to time it intensified to become unsupportable. At that time though about a lack of oxygenation, because I wore mask for the whole time I was working. About 9:am when I drove to home, I saw everything foggy in front of me.  When I get home I took  some paracetamol and another painkiller, because at that time my entire body was so warm, and the headache was very bad. I slept for 5 hours, when I woke up I went to the mechanic to fix my car.  While I got back during the time I saw the same foggy vision.

                                                Unusual exhaustion within an hour of the vaccine.  Had to go to bed and slept into the evening developing a fever of 103, severe thirst and chills. The fever lasted until 10:00 a.m. the following day, but weakness, thirst, chills and body aches continued for 3 more days intermittently. I would feel like I could finally exercise and then be too weak and tired to go back to routine. My appetite declined for 4 to 5 days as food didn&#39;t taste appealing. On Thursday, April 8, I announced to my mom in the morning that I finally felt like I was back at almost 100% and later in the afternoon felt nauseous, incredible pain in my chest and had dry heaves. I finally vomited some and was once again overcome by a fever of 101 and all I could do was sleep from severe exhaustion. I am against medication, but finally agreed to taking ibuprofen and tums. After sleeping into the next day around noon, I finally was able to eat some breakfast but the pain in my chest continued and I could rid it for another day. I intermittently had to sleep and gave up my exercise routine until my body has had time to recuperate. I have not fully recovered, but my appetite is picking up. I still require more sleep than normal.

                                                Pain in chest and back began on Wednesday 4/14.  What started out feeling like an uncomfortable pulled muscle in my back/chest area on Wednesday escalated rapidly to very sharp stabbing pains in my chest and back by Thursday afternoon 4/15.  After discussing my symptoms with the office of my PCP Thursday afternoon, I was told to go to the Emergency Room for evaluation.  I checked into the ER at approx 6pm that Thursday evening on 4/15.  While there I underwent a blood test, EKG and a chest Xray.  Upon evaluating the results of each test the Dr on assignment stated that there were no problems with major organs but could not diagnose.    Small red marks began developing on the right side of my chest that same day and progressively expanded in quantity across the right side of my chest and back.  A follow-up visit with my PCP was completed on Tuesday 4/20 and the diagnosis of Shingles was confirmed.  Pain has not subsided and has only gotten worse as of 4/21.  Prescription treatments began the evening of 4/20.

                                                The evening of the vaccination I began experiencing tingling at the site of the shot, then this extended through the night to chest pains and tightness in the chest. That continued through the night and into the following day. The following day and  lasting until present (4/27/2021) I have continued to experience tingling at night, extending to my arm and fingers, random very sharp pains in my chest, and some feeling of strong heart throbbing. This subsides during the day-time (when I&#39;m upright versus lying down) but all of these symptoms return during the evening. These are all things I never experienced prior to the vaccine. Also, I have tested regularly for COVID-19 since my companyconducts covid-19 testing and I have not been infected with COVID-19 at any point during the past year. The continuation of these symptoms is concerning. There have been at least two instances where the sharp pains in my chest were much more intense than the other chest pains I have felt since the vaccine.

                                                Felt tired at 2:15pm, stayed awake a bit longer than napped for a couple hours. At about 10:30pm I started feeling sick, fever of 99.6, muscle and joint pain, chills, dizziness, weakness. Left arm where I got injected also felt like it was falling asleep at some point when it shouldn&#39;t have been based on how I was positioned. I finally took an ibuprofen so I could sleep around 2:30am, and felt better a couple hours later or so. Today so far I feel fine but my resting heart rate is about 30 beats higher than normal so I&#39;m still responding to vaccine.  I think overall my symptoms aren&#39;t out of the ordinary, just way stronger than I was expecting. I felt miserable.

About ten minutes after getting the vaccine, while sitting in a chair, I began to get tunnel vision and felt extremely tired. I broke out in a cold sweat all over my body. I began to lose my vision like I was fainting and I momentarily blacked out or dozed off, then came back awake. I started to get tunnel vision again for a minute, then it faded away. Then I continued sweating for a minute and then it faded away. After a couple minutes I felt fine again. I sat for another several minutes then left at 1:15 feeling ok with just a sore shoulder.

He turned pale and fell sideways off chair onto floor lowering himself with his knee. He did not bump his head, he was sweating profusely, but did not lose consciousness. I yelled to the tech to call 911. Patient was sitting on floor.  He said he did not eat much all day. He was alert and talking. He said he fainted when his wife had their baby. We gave his some orange juice. The paramedics arrived 8 minutes later and checked his vitals. In the meantime we called his wife. Paramedics checked his BP, glucose and questioned patient. Patient refuse to go with paramedics. Wife came and paramedics released him to her.

About five minutes in, another patient who received the vaccine together with patient told us the patient had fainted. Patient was slumped over to the side when I came to check on patient. I called the patient a few times and patient started to come to. I asked the patient how he was feeling and if he had any difficulty breathing to assess for anaphylactic shock. Patient was breathing normal, but was sweating and a bit confused. Patient reported feeling dizzy. I explained to patient that he fainted for a few minutes and instructed to sit as I did not feel comfortable having patient lay down in the state he was in. Patient was given water and a fan to help cool him down and legs elevated (patient reported feeling much better with the fan blowing on him). Patient sat at the pharmacy for over 30 minutes before heading to the bathroom. At this point, patient were no longer dizzy and I instructed him to get up slowly and assessed that patient was no longer dizzy before letting him go to the bathroom.

At about the 17 minute mark patiently suddenly fainted in his chair for 15-30 seconds. He then began to vomit and woke up in the process. Once he fully came back to, he said he felt remarkedly better and no longer felt light-headed or clammy. Following this episode he reported feeling back to normal and that he had just ate a large breakfast before coming in for the shot, but did not feel bad in any way anymore. We observed for another 30 minutes and patient showed no further sign of issues. He was released with his wife.

Monday morning at approximately 0230 i woke up to what i can only describe as lightning pains in my legs.  It was a very intense pain shooting from my upper thighs to my knees and slightly bending around to the top of my calves on the outside of the leg.  Monday all day i did not feel well.  Had a dull pain in center of chest, and my left arm from the shoulder blade to the elbow had what i can only describe as a slight warm sensation.  I was also very &#34;foggy&#34; and light headed.  On Tuesday the pain in my chest worsened.  My left arm kept going numb (and still does today 04.21.2021), my jaw hurt, i was light headed and again very foggy.  On Wednesday it was the same thing and I called the VA and they told me to come to the ER for evaluation.

After conferring with my primary care facility, it was recommended that I see an ophthalmologist. Confirmed that I had a Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) and recommended I meet with a retinal specialist.  Dr. confirmed the BRVO was caused by a blood clot and commenced treatment via eye injection.  I then met with my primary physician to discuss the situation.  He recommend further tests to determine whether I had other clotting.  In addition to blood work, he order MRIs of my brain, head and neck region and also recommended that I meet with a thrombosis specialist.  I met with a Dr. who ordered additional blood work for additional testing.  All tests performed to determine if I had additional clotting have come back negative.

                                                I received the COVID Vaccine at 12:30 PM. My temperature had been increasing all afternoon along with my heart rate. At roughly 8:40 PM, my temperature increased dramatically to approximately 38.9C. This may have happened over a relatively short period of time, since it was 37.9 C at approximately 8:00 PM. My heart rate increased to 150 bpm and I became dizzy. After a minute, my heart rate decreased to roughly 115 bpm.  Unsure whether to call EMS or not, I called a friend, who is a Dr. at the local hospital (Dr. is a colleague we do research together.) Dr. was concerned but provided information on what to do and when to call EMS or be driven to the ER. I spent the rest of the evening with a pulse between 105 and 110 and my temperature hovered around 38.9C until at least 12:30 AM.   The next day, my heart rate had decreased to roughly 80 bpm and my temperature to approximately 37.8C. I spent most of Tuesday sleeping. Today (Wednesday May 12, 2021) my heart rate is down to roughly 76bpm. My temperature is holding around 37.2C.   I have reported this to the CDC through the COVID vaccine reporting app.   My resting pulse is usually 62 bpm with a waking pulse of 58-60. My normal temperature is 36.5-36.7C. I have a wellness exam schedule for Monday. Dr. is not my regular GP, but was available at a time when my regular doctor was not available.

By day 13 I started to get intermittent headaches that are very sharp. I am still getting them after three weeks. I have tried muscle relaxants and anti-anxiety medicine but they did not help. At night I am able to sleep but, in the morning, when I get up, I get sharp pains that are like ice picks and last for 3-5 seconds. Some of the headaches are more electric and as the day goes on it gets worse. I have tried taking Magnesium and Vitamin B-Complex and the headaches have changed to where they are starting in the afternoon instead of the morning. The headaches are a seven on a scale of 1-10. Sometimes the headaches come with a low grade fever.

                                                Approximately 10 hours after receiving the injection, I experienced extreme chills, nausea, elevated heart rate. The last time I experienced symptoms like this was on the first day I started chemotherapy and had an allergic reaction to one of the chemo drugs (bleomycin). I had a delayed reaction hours later and went to the ER. It was determined it was an allergy. So I took Claritin D 24 H and saw the symptoms I was experiencing last night dissipate.

                                                Patient received Janssen vaccine was told to sit for 15 minutes post observation. He came up shortly after (less than 5 mins post imz) saying he didn&#39;t feel well, like he was going to pass out. I immediately came from the pharmacy, my tech sat a chair behind him. I called for optical to call a code white. The patient requested to sit on the ground. At this point, his wife was present. He was sweating. I gave him an ice pack, a water after it was determined he was breathing okay. He was pale, extremely lethargic and sweating. After sitting him on floor I told my tech to call 911. I took his blood pressure, it was 99/73, pulse 75. Very low for him. Hes on blood pressure medicine but been having issues controlling it. He later tells me hes terrified of needles. He also tells his wife he hadn&#39;t eaten all day. I stayed with the patient until ems left with him because when standing his heart rate dropped 20 points, after they stuck him again to check his blood sugar. They determined then he should be checked out at the hospital and they took him.

By 9 pm I was alternating between hot and cold sweats.  By 10 pm I was vomiting and defeating uncontrollably while still alternating between hot and cold sweats. I dry heaved until around 3 am and then finally passed out. My fever never exceeded right about 100 degrees. For the next 2 days I was incredibly exhausted with muscle aches and a minor headache. I didn?t return to baseline for approximately 6 days after the shot.

                                                For the 36 hours after my vaccine, I had commonly listed side effects; chills, aches, and shivers. These subsided, and I developed a cough for the next 3 or 4 days. This developed into more of a chesty feeling and lethargic feeling. On the 8th day after my vaccine, my symptoms were similar to those in Covid positive cases; chest tightness, dry cough, and chills. I went to get tested, and was found to be Covid-19 positive. Since then, I have experienced severe headaches, continued tight chest, cough, chills, and sweats.

Shortly after these symptoms I begin to have uncontrollable chills followed by a fever and Nausea. The whole time starting around 8pm I had pretty bad muscle aches as well. I took a warm shower and bundled up the whole night because I had a fever, aches, chills, and nausea. It was impossible to sleep because of this and sometimes my heart was beating fast as well. The next morning I had a headache that would not go away until I took Tylenol. The whole next day I felt exhausted as well and very weak. I began to feel better on day 3 but still feel somewhat foggy from the shot. I would not recommend this vaccine to anyone and would never get it again and hopefully the foggy sensation goes away.

Patient fell to the ground in a sitting position. Patient was assessed by BLS and refused transport.  Patient switched positions and allowed his passenger to drive off scene.

                                                Had a sudden onset fever which reached 103 the evening of the injection.  There was muscle soreness, fatigue, my pulse was above 80 all night and reached 100 during the peak of the fever.  By the next morning, the fever had dropped to 100, fatigue remained and a slight headache appeared.  The headache was gone by noon, the fatigue remained all day.  The evening after the injection, a slight fever returned and then stopped.  Two days after the injection, there were no further averse reactions other than slight soreness in the injection site.  I am no longer fatigued and feel fine.  Hope this information helps.

                                                Patient is a 43-year-old, male with a history of fear of needles. At 2:39 pm, the patient received a dose of the Janssen vaccine, (lot number 1808980, expires on 06/20/2021) on right deltoid, given by RN. Immediately following the vaccination at 2:40 pm, Patient reportedly slumped his head forward in his seat and was caught by RN, sustaining zero physical bodily injuries. The patient was unconscious for approximately 2 seconds. EMT&#39;S responded immediately at 2:40 pm and took the patient&#39;s vitals. At 2:40 pm, the patients vitals were: 117 systolic BP and HR 89 (EMT unable to hear the diastolic BP due to environmental noise). The patient appeared diaphoretic, pale, with warm, clammy hands and a weak radial pulse. The patient was given a water and tolerated intake of water. The patient was assisted by EMT  to a anti-gravity chair at 2:43pm. The patient was observed to have a steady gait and reporting no dizziness. At 2:44 pm, the patient&#39;s vitals were: HR 54 and 110 systolic BP (EMT unable to hear the diastolic BP due to environmental noise). At 2:50, the patient had a strong, bounding radial pulse with a HR of 70 BPM and 115 systolic BP (EMT unable to hear the diastolic BP due to environmental noise). At 2:55 pm, the patient&#39;s vitals were: HR 75 BPM and 115 systolic BP (EMT unable to hear the diastolic BP due to environmental noise). At this time the patient reports feeling &#34;better&#34;. At 3:00 pm the patient&#39;s vitals were: HR 81 BPM and 118 systolic BP (EMT unable to hear the diastolic BP due to environmental noise). At 3:05 pm the patient&#39;s vitals were: HR 77 BPM and 120 systolic BP (EMT unable to hear the diastolic BP due to environmental noise). At 3:10 pm the patient&#39;s vitals were: HR 74 BPM and 118 systolic BP (EMT unable to hear the diastolic BP due to environmental noise). At 3:15 pm, the patient was assisted up from anti-gravity chair. The patient had a steady and balanced gait. The patient denied any additional dizziness, lightheadedness, or nausea. EMT provided patient with education related to when to call his HCP (i.e. dizziness, itching of throat). The patient reported he was &#34;ok to drive home&#34; and left to the parking lot at 3:15 pm.

(4) Muscle aches 2 days (previously injured muscles/joints became very sore 1-2 day after injection [left hip, right foot, left quad, lower back] - believe tylenol reduced inflammation) --symptoms ended 3-4 days after injection; slight fatigue remains 7 days later.

                                                By midnight after my vaccine: Shortness of breath.  Three days later around 6:25 am on April 15, 2020: I got out of bed, next moment I recall is of me on the floor. No memory of falling. I was shaking uncontrollably as if my body was getting many commands at the same time but I had no control over it. I could not call out for help. At one point I was biting my right  hand but could not make myself stop until my shaking stopped. Bite did not penetrate skin but I had visible bite mark on my hand.  I regained control suddenly and just got up slowly and shaken by the experience. Wife then drove me to the ER.  Been feeling pressure on my head.

The vaccine was admistered and the patient was asked to stay seated in the waiting area after the injection. After a few minutes the patient passed out while seated and was moved to being seated on the floor by staff. The patient was given water and his blood pressure was monitored periodically for the next hour before releasing the patient.

                                                I received the shot on 4/10. First 24 hours I had a slight fever and headache. Treated with Acetaninophhen. Since that time, I had relatively mild symptoms 4/11 - 4/13. Mostly fatigue.  On 4/14, I had a sudden increase in heart rate, dizziness, tingling sensation in all arms and legs and weakness in my limbs/grip. This prompted me to visit the ER. They ran numerous blood tests amd scans on me but found no abnormalities. Various unusual symptoms have continued to persist since 4/14.  For brief moments I feel fine.  At other times I have experience fatigue, diziness/vertigo, rapid heart rate, pins and needles feeling in my left hand and left leg.  Left leg numbness/tightness and heaviness. The fingers on my left hand sometimes move involuntarily.  And my anxiety has also gone up during this time. Tonight it has migratee to my left foot, where I have numbness in several of my toes.  I&#39;m looking for advice. Should I be concerned? Should these symptoms still be occurring 11 days after receiving my shot?  It has been very distressing and there seem to be very few people who have knowledge on this subject.  My care providers keep saying to self monitor and contact them if symptoms worsen. The problem is symptoms don&#39;t necessarily worsen, they just migrate from one area of my body to another.  The numbness comes and goes in maybe 1-2 hour intervals.

Within about 5-10 minutes his girlfriend comes to the pharmacy window and tells me he&#39;s feeling bad.  By the time I get to his chair he is very lethargic and slumped over.  I sit him up in the chair and his head rolls back and his eyes have rolled back in his head.   I place him on the floor and instructed my staff to call 911.   The patient presented with sweats and was unresponsive for about 10-20 seconds.   When he came to he asked how he got on the floor.   The patient never had any trouble breathing  heart rate was steady the entire time.   When EMS arrived they checked him out and was fine.  He refused transport to the hospital.  He walked out of the store after about 30 minutes from the point of his passing out.

                                                I felt fine all day and went to bed at 9:30pm. I woke up to my body shaking uncontrollably and I was freezing at 10:30pm. My wife felt my skin and she said I was burning up. Unfortunately our thermometer wasn&#39;t working so I don&#39;t know my temperature, but I have never in my life shaken so badly with a fever. I couldn&#39;t control myself and I was shaking so hard that my muscles were sore from it, but I still couldn&#39;t stop. I then began vomiting every 45 minutes or so. This happened for nearly 4 hours until 2:18am. Then very suddenly everything just stopped. No more feeling cold (actually I then felt very warm and couldn&#39;t cool off. I was sweating quite a bit). No more shaking. No more vomiting. I did get a wicked headache, but I figured it was due to dehydration and took two Advil. The Advil didn&#39;t do anything and I was awake until 5:59am because my head hurt too badly to sleep. Finally I slept for about 4.5 hours. Then I just felt worn out for most of the day on the 10th, and couldn&#39;t shake the headache. Then on the evening if the 10th, I started getting a sore throat and a slightly runny nose. I went to bed that way. When I woke up on the 11th (today) I still had the sore throat and slight runny nose. The headache was gone, but I felt tightness in my chest. As I went throughout the day, I&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;m short of breath with doing most things. I have two young children, so even taking care of them I feel like at times I&#39;m struggling for breath. I&#39;m not in bad shape and am a runner, so my cardio isn&#39;t bad. So I was surprised by this.

Woke up April 7th at 7AM with sharp pains in my left shoulder (same side as shot) and slight shortness of breath, and slight chest pain in the left quadrant of my torso (same side as shot).  Proceeded to take Advil and seemed to help a bit.  Minor aches/pains and shortness of breath throughout the day until about 8PM.  At this time shoulder chest pain became more severe, and breathing became very strained, short, and painful.  Pain and breathing kept getting worse and at midnight on Wednesday night thought I was having a heart attack due to extreme chest pain, couldn&#39;t breath, lightheaded, dizzy, tingly extremities.  My wife drove me to ER at 12:30 AM Thursday.

At the time of arrival to the medical clinic, he had refractory nausea and vomiting after receiving Zofran earlier in the day at another clinical site. Medical treatment consisted of IV Fluid bolus with maintenance fluids, IV Phenergan for the nausea and vomiting, and IV Ketorolac for headache pain. His  symptoms resolved and he started to feel better so a clinical decision was made to discharge him home in the care of a close friend. He declined any other treatment modalities or medications at the time of the discharge.  The patient returned on 03/28/2021 with a right arm DVT proven on U/S. He was then started on anticoagulation therapy after specialist phone consult and will be closely followed.

He took Advil and went along with his day . He took 3 tablet of Advil 200mg  every 4-5 hours all day ( total of 3 dose that day) . By night time the case was progressively worse as the whole chest had a lot of pain . He thought that he had heart attack . He thought that he was about to  pass out . He could not stand on his own . So his wife took him to emergency room at mid night at 12:30 am on 08-APR-2021. He stayed there for 5 hours and they did  bunch of tests , EKG which rolled out the heart attack .They did  Chest X-ray which found things then did D-dimer which its level was very high . They found  bunch of clots in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides. They did ultra sound on the legs  which had no evidence of blood clots . They discharged him  from the emergency room as  they felt that he was ok to be out . After couple of hours after discharge , patient&#39;s health care professional wrote for him Eliquis, antibiotic and pain reliver. He was given antibiotic because he had  beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed) . It was found air sacs in lung with signs of pneumonia in both lobes . He came home and started to  monitor his blood oxygen . He stayed in the  same position till recovery . He was better each day since last week but still had sinus and cramping in the chest ( very minor but was still there). The lung capacity was very limited to take some steps. Patient stated that he needed a specialist to understand his condition. He had no medical history before that incidence . He was wondering regarding which type of blood thinner was good for this type of blood clots because he read that the regular blood thinners are not good for that type of blood clot which his HCP gave (regular blood thinner). Laboratory data included: Total lung capacity decreased (NR: not provided) lung capacity is very limited. On 08-APR-2021, Laboratory data included: Chest X-ray (NR: not provided) found things, EKG (NR: not provided) rolled out heart attack, Fibrin D dimer (NR: not provided) level was very high, and Ultrasound scan (NR: not provided) no evidence of blood clots.  Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included: apixaban, and ibuprofen. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of the severe cramping in left shoulder and upper body, chest pain (whole chest had lot of pain)/thought that he had heart attack, shortness of breath/could not breath, thought that he was about to pass out, difficulty in standing, bunch of clots in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides, beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed), cramping in chest and sinus was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments:  This 44-year-old male patient reported blood clots of both lungs 2 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  The patient denies any medical history/condition prior to vaccination.  The symptoms reported were severe cramping of arm that spread to his whole chest and upper body and shortness of breath; the patient thought he had a heart attack, about to pass out and could not stand because of the progression of pain.  EKG done at the emergency room ruled out heat attack, D-Dimer was reported to be very high, clots were found in the bottom sides of both lungs and on the top of one of the sides, x-ray showed beginning stages of pneumonia on both lobes of the lungs (collapsed).  The patient was prescribed with Eliquis, an unspecified antibiotic and pain reliever.  Outcome of the events were not reported.   Based on the information that is available, the event is assessed as plausible with the causal association to immunization, per WHO causality classification of adverse events following immunization based on a lack of a definitive plausible biological mechanism.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

They finally decided it was an allergic reaction. Gave a steroid shot and Benadryl. Sent home on steroids for 5 days. The next day had rash and itching. The next day it was worse looked like lace pattern rash over most of his body and really bad itching. Like this through the 20th then he took Claritin and put on anti -itch cream. The next  day the rash had mostly cleared but still a little itchy. Today the 22 I have had a really bad headache.

                                                Pt. received the vaccine at approximately 2:44pm.  Before I could hand him his card, his hands began trembling and he looked pale.  I asked how he was feeling.  He reported feeling shaky, dizzy, and very hot.  I asked him if he was having any difficulty breathing, had tightness in his throat/airways, or even felt a tingle.  He said no.  Noting the time, I asked if he had eaten lunch.  I asked if he has ever felt this way before.  He said he had when he gets a &#34;hypoglycemic attack.&#34;  While not diabetic nor on any medications, he said he will occasionally get very low blood sugar.  He said he had not eaten since early that morning.  Another employee brought some juice I requested.  I again asked him about symptoms related to anaphylaxis, to which was not an indication of an anaphylactic reaction.  I gave him the juice to sip.  I asked him again about symptoms.  Because he was still dizzy, I took his blood pressure/heart rate.  His BP was 160/119 and heart rate 96bpm.  His color became more gray over the next several minutes.  He was still too dizzy to stand, felt hot, shaky, and now nauseous.  He handed over the juice and was given a receptacle if he vomited.  We suspected a vasovagal response, but was still symptomatic after 10 minutes. Meanwhile, the other pharmacist tried to call his doctor&#39;s office.  We learned his doctor had moved away and he had not yet come in nor selected a new provider.   We asked him if he felt he needed to be seen by a doctor.  He said he did and agreed to us calling an ambulance.   The ambulance arrived around 3:10.  The EMTs took his BP.  It had come down, but he could not stand up without his knees buckling.  The EMTs got him on the stretcher and took him to the hospital.

EMS were called and he was seen in ER due to low heart rate and sweating to rule out any heart conditions. He had 2 EKGs - one in the ambulance and one in the ER. He also had to have a CT for falling and bumping his head to rule out that injury. The DX was listed as a vagal response, but we are not so sure we agree given that he is 45 years old, has no priory history or anxiety about shots.

I was bedridden for 36 hours and then the symptoms gradually subsided by day 3.  I then developed a sense of chest tightness intermittently for the next 4 days usually at night.  I did not have chest pain, but had tachypnea at times with a respiratory rate up to 22/min. At day 7 this resolved.

                                                On March 13, I received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine at the  clinic  The pharmacist monitored me for symptoms but there were none right away. I did have a fever and some body aches in the two or three days that followed but those were short-lived.  While driving on March 16, I started experiencing some irregular breathing and periods of shortness of breath about three hours after leaving home. I stopped at the emergency room at the Health Center where Dr diagnosed me with an acute pulmonary embolism after discovering a small blood clot in one of my lungs. He prescribed me with Eliquis, which I am still taking today. Their phone number is provided if you have questions.  I haven&#39;t had too many shortness of breath episodes lately but do not know if the blood clot is still there. I am scheduled to see my hematologist on April 27 to get further updates on this. My hematologist Dr is located in clinic number provided While it has not yet been proven that the vaccine caused the blood clot in my lung, I feel the need to report this in the wake of recent news about the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. My hematologist and primary care physician are both aware that I have received the vaccine but I have not received any further communication from them.

The patient did not report feeling any adverse symptoms at the checkout station after his 15 minute observation period and before leaving the vaccination clinic.    After patient returned home, his partner reports considerable swelling on his left arm, continued hallucinations and trying to dismiss her concerns. Subsequently, that same day, partner reports the patient had a severe migrane and began to lose feeling on his left arm and leg, at which point the patient also lost consciousness.  Also at this point, the partner calls 911.   After arrival of emergency personnel, the patient regains consciousness, but does not remember name and complains of continued pain on his arm. He is transported to hospital where he spends 3 nights and receives treatment and care for stroke symptoms.    Patient reports that he does not remember much of anything 1.5 days after vaccination.   After returning home from hospital, patient complains of memory lapses and begins seeing neurologist for minor seizures during his sleep.   Wife reports that patient now lashes out and easily loses temper due to the fact that his memory is foggy.

Patient found to have a Hunt Hess 3 Fisher Grade 3 Subarachnoid Hemorrhage with hydrocephalus s/p EVD,  s/p cerebral angiogram on 4/18 negative for aneurysm/AVM. On the evening of 4/20, patient became acutely hypoxic with wheezing for which he required oxygen via 10L oxymask. During 4/21, his oxygen requirements continued to increase with increased work of breathing requiring high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) at 50L/60%  &#43; pulmonary congestion on imaging and he was treated with diuresis. On 4/22, oxygen needs increased requiring 70L/100% with worsening imaging. He was then started on steroids, antibiotics were broadened, epoprostenal started in addition to diuresis. On 4/23, patient reports improved breathing and is on non-rebreather. Antibiotics, steroids, and epoprostenal were discontinued as patient showed improvement of oxygenation without clear signs of infection. Of note,  patient reports vaping in the past 2-3 months.  Patient has also been intermittently febrile. Wife was concerned that these symptoms were possibly related to him getting the J&amp;J vaccine on 4/11. Patient is currently still in hospital on day 6 of admission at this time.

                                                Before receiving the vaccination the patient mentioned he had a fear of needles.  Patient was asked if he ever fainted after getting a vaccination or injection and patient reported no.   The vaccine was administered to the patient and patient appeared to be fine for the next few minutes after getting vaccinated.  Patient was told he could take a seat in the waiting area and wait until his 15-minutes were up and he could go.  Patient was seated in the waiting area for about a minute but then got up to walk down one of the isles. When walking down the isle patient fainted and collapsed. This occurred approximately 10 minutes or so after he received the vaccine.  Patient was helped to a chair and once seated appeared to shake/convulse (almost like a seizure) for approximately 5-10 seconds before snapping out of it and regaining consciousness.  Afterwards he was alert and talking but didn&#39;t remember fainting.  911 was called and he was checked out by paramedics. After observing him for 15 minutes or so and determining his heartrate and blood pressure were normal and he appeared to be ok, the paramedics told him they can take him to the hospital to be evaluated further, or he was free to leave on his own without going to the hospital.  The patient said he felt fine and declined being taken to the hospital. After another 10-15 minutes the patient left under his own power. Patient mentioned he would possibly be calling his physician and alerting them to the episode.

                                                He began getting dizzy immediately after vaccine - pale, sweating, and felt like he was going to vomit.  He remained in the IMZ room for observation and applied a cool compress to forehead and back of neck.  Coloring came back after about 10-15 minutes and he said he felt better.  Also mentioned that this happened to him after he got a TDap vaccine about 15 years ago - he said it is a mental thing with him and does not like to get vaccines.

This continued for about 3-3.5 weeks. On the night of Apr 16, he went to bed early not feeling well. Next morning he complained of heaviness in the chest area. We immediately consulted Dr., and mentioned that he got the vaccine. Dr. advised us to immediately go to an Emergency Room. Patient was found to be having a heart attack. His right artery was 100% blocked. The 3 left arteries had no blockage at all. Angioplasty was done and he had a stent placed in right artery. The clot was removed as part of angioplasty. He now needs to be on blood thinners for life.

Unusual for me hour long nosebleed resulting in use of a half of box of tissues. It occurred at 3am so doing anything other than homecare didnt seem necessary. After getting this vaccine I felt a brain fog for approx 15 days especially after being awake for about 8 hours, unusual for me as well. The nosebleed was of most concern and with the recent pause I saw on todays news about blood clotting issues. I felt it was important I report my experience on day 8 of vaccine and days 2 thru 15 of vaccine. I would not go back in time and take this vaccine based on my side effects.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I did not feel well within a minute or so of receiving the shot - not an allergic reaction per se. The nurses took my blood pressure and it was 200&#43;/100&#43; and HR was 108. They continued to monitor and it slowly went down over the course of the 45 minutes I was there. Upon departure, BP reading was at about 160/90. I monitored that evening and Sunday and was normal most of the time. I did have a similar feeling Sunday afternoon and Monday afternoon, and when I checked my BP it was about 150/90 and HR was elevated (between 100-115bpm). Eventually I felt better, excluding expected side effects I&#39;ve had - fever, aches, and fatigue. As of Tuesday (today as of writing), I am feeling better than yesterday, less fatigue and no fever thus far. I am hoping no more episodes with the elevated BP and HR occur today or in the near future. I did notify my physician about this and he asked me to monitor my BP for the next week, stay hydrated, and report back if no improvement in BP readings.

He developed 3 serous filled bulla with the largest measuring  5cm by 2.5cm with surrounding erythema and tenderness to palpation in the area.  This was associated with headache, diaphoresis, shortness of breath, substernal chest discomfort, and sensation of throat itching. By 72 hours the bulla had popped and the patient&#39;s the only remaining symptom was right upper arm pain.

                                                Since receiving the vaccine, I have developed tightness in my chest and shortness of breath.  At times, it has been severe.  Feeling like I might pass out, I went to Immediate Care on 04/12.  They didn?t identify a cause.  On 04/15, I went to my Doctor, who noted wheezing in my upper lungs.  An inhaler and pantoprazole were prescribed.  At times, it feels like I am having something similar to an asthma attack.  The inhaler has helped.  Prior to the vaccine, I didn?t have any history of breathing problems, nor does it run in my family.

This burst and was clearly filled with blood.  Over the ensuing 24 hours, he has had multiple such blisters and came to the Emergency Room for fear of a reaction to the COVID vaccine that he had had 13 days ago.  This was Johnson and Johnson.  He had no major reactions to it.  On coming to the Emergency Room today, he noticed significant petechiae forming over the lower extremities as well as scattered petechiae forming elsewhere.  He presented to the Emergency Room and there was noted to have a CBC showing hematocrit of 51, 4000 platelets, and a white count of 7.7 with an unremarkable differential.  INR is 1.1.  D-dimer was 0.33.  Chemistries were limited, but were within normal limits.

                                                For about 36 hours after vaccine - I started getting headaches and I never get them. I had backaches and my legs were hurting too. My blood pressure was elevated as well. And that was not going away either. I went to doctor. My headaches have decreased. But for the last two to three days I have been getting chest pains. I have called the doctor this morning and I&#39;m waiting to call me back.  It&#39;s not ongoing pain - just every now and then - I&#39;m not sure what it is.

Then that day he started getting a headache, feverish, took Tylenol and felt better.  The next day he noticed his heart rate would not go down, it will not go down below 100, will shoot up to 130.  He went to the ER and at one point went to 150.  They prescribed him some medicine to lower his blood pressure and he has been taking that and it has not been helping.  He also went to his doctor and told him that it was probably anxiety, and his heart rate will still not go down.  He has not had any other reactions other than this and he&#39;s scared.

                                                Day 1: Saturday morning March 6 at 5:00am I was shaken out of my sleep with a nasty migraine, sour stomach, intense body aches, stuffy nose, fever (102f). Classic flu like symptoms. I was extremely sick all day Saturday (level of sick: 8/10). Day 2: Sunday morning March 7 I awoke again extremely sick, just as sick as Saturday. All same symptoms (level of sick: 7/10). Sunday night I was incredibly miserable, all flu symptoms, I did not sleep Sunday night, up all night and up all day the next day Monday. Day 3: Monday I continued to be sick, all same symptoms, all day long. This time the blood shot eyes &amp; bloody nose came on, fever was steady at 101f (level of sick: 6/10). Day 4: Tuesday woke up still stick, same flu like symptoms. I feel the headache has gotten worse, in fact way worse. Fever steady at 101f all day. Overall I&#39;m not as sick except the headache and fever (level of sick: 6/10).  Day 5: Wednesday I was really hoping I&#39;d make a full recovery but still still sick, fever dropped for a few hours then came back, fever peaks and bounces around at 101f. Headache is absolutely nasty, I feel intense pain in the back of my neck and head, hard to sleep or lay down. (level of sick: 5/10). Day 6: Thursday I feel like I&#39;m just about kick this sickness, feeling way better. I dont have a fever today but I still have an incredibly nasty headache, really intense, my eyes hurt, back of my neck hurts. (level of sick: 3/10). Day 7: Friday, no flu symptoms, finally!! But the headache continues, really bad. It sort of disables my ability to function with the headache. Back of my neck and back of head hurts, inside my brain hurts. Ugh! Day 8: Saturday, no flu, no fever, although still bad headache. I&#39;ve been taking Advil all week to help reduce the headache. It helps, but after about 6 hours later the headache returns. Late in the evening Saturday my head was pounding. Day 9: Sunday headache not that bad, mild headache lingered throughout the day, tolerable. Day 10: Monday no headache!! Today was the first full day of full happiness!! *NOTE*: In July 2020 I got COVID extremely bad, spent 4 days in the ICU, couldnt breathe!! I had a fever of 103 for 6 days straight before calling 911 to come and get me. I was in bad shape, lost 30 lbs, had respiratory breathing issue for about 2 months after hospital stay. Most sick I&#39;ve ever been, total game changer, I will never be the same. To this day I feel my respiratory is at 90%, fatigue still comes around every so often. --- Thank you ---

                                                Day 1: Saturday morning March 6 at 5:00am I was shaken out of my sleep with a nasty migraine, sour stomach, intense body aches, stuffy nose, fever (102f). Classic flu like symptoms. I was extremely sick all day Saturday (level of sick: 8/10). Day 2: Sunday morning March 7 I awoke again extremely sick, just as sick as Saturday. All same symptoms (level of sick: 7/10). Sunday night I was incredibly miserable, all flu symptoms, I did not sleep Sunday night, up all night and up all day the next day Monday. Day 3: Monday I continued to be sick, all same symptoms, all day long. This time the blood shot eyes &amp; bloody nose came on, fever was steady at 101f (level of sick: 6/10). Day 4: Tuesday woke up still stick, same flu like symptoms. I feel the headache has gotten worse, in fact way worse. Fever steady at 101f all day. Overall I&#39;m not as sick except the headache and fever (level of sick: 6/10).  Day 5: Wednesday I was really hoping I&#39;d make a full recovery but still still sick, fever dropped for a few hours then came back, fever peaks and bounces around at 101f. Headache is absolutely nasty, I feel intense pain in the back of my neck and head, hard to sleep or lay down. (level of sick: 5/10). Day 6: Thursday I feel like I&#39;m just about kick this sickness, feeling way better. I dont have a fever today but I still have an incredibly nasty headache, really intense, my eyes hurt, back of my neck hurts. (level of sick: 3/10). Day 7: Friday, no flu symptoms, finally!! But the headache continues, really bad. It sort of disables my ability to function with the headache. Back of my neck and back of head hurts, inside my brain hurts. Ugh! Day 8: Saturday, no flu, no fever, although still bad headache. I&#39;ve been taking Advil all week to help reduce the headache. It helps, but after about 6 hours later the headache returns. Late in the evening Saturday my head was pounding. Day 9: Sunday headache not that bad, mild headache lingered throughout the day, tolerable. Day 10: Monday no headache!! Today was the first full day of full happiness!! *NOTE*: In July 2020 I got COVID extremely bad, spent 4 days in the ICU, couldnt breathe!!

Acute renal failure, hypothyroidism, transaminitis, elevated troponin likely associated with rhabdo. On sepsis protocol (vancomycin, meropenem and acyclovir)  Disc

                                                I would like to report what happened with all the facts.  One week after I had vaccine, I had very serious nose bleeding in the morning. I said very serious because I felt it cannot stop by itself. I called 911 and went to ER. First time, I use 911 and ER. All previous nose bleeding is very minor and it will stop in a minute. But this time, I just felt the blood just pouring into my mouth. So I was scared and  asked my wife called 911. After 2-3 hours, the bleeding stopped and I back home. To be cautious, I made an appointment with family doctor on next day (24th). But the bleeding happened again in the evening ( cannot remember exactly, but around 9pm). This time I just used the clipper for my nose and it took another 2 hours for the bleeding to stop. I had a very rough night while sitting on bed and had very little sleep. The next morning (24th), the bleeding come back after I used the restroom. The same feeling as the two bleeding before. I rushed to doctor&#39;s office even not my appointment yet. The family doctor said he cannot do anything since he cannot observe the place of blooding and he does not have instrument needed. I was referred to a specialist. And luckily I had the same day appointment. We rushed there and after roughly several hours waiting, I was the specialist and finally he did the treatment. Since then, my nose is ok and no serious bleeding again.  After I saw the side effects of JJ vaccine, I think it is better for me to report you what happened. I strongly suspect that my serious bleeding was caused by the drop of platelet which was side effect of the vaccine. I will have one blood work today. And will let you know results if you are interested. Again, I never had such serious bleeding before and that is the reason for my suspect.  All the best

It is unknown if the pericarditis was associated to the vaccine but thought it was a good idea to document here.

I fell asleep one hour into my arrival and slept for 17 hours. Up to and including today I am having headaches, pain in my legs on left side only, nausea, lack of sleep and a continued smell similar to dried blood after a injury. I have also have and continue to have shortness of breath and chest pains resulting in two panic attacks within the last three days. This has led me to report this and I have doctor visit scheduled for 4/22. I also reported today based on internet search of reactions.

                                                On April 7th in the  morning, I woke with sharp pain in right calf.  It was not swollen, discolored, or hot.  I had not participated in any activity recently that I felt caused an injury.  I took Advil and Tylenol and rested for a few days, but the pain got worse.  On April 14th, after reading reports on some adverse affects from the J&amp;J vaccine, I made an appointment to see my primary physician.  After blood work and an ultrasound, I was diagnosed with a DVT in my right calf.  I have a started a 90-day cycle of Xarelto to treatment the DVT.

Later had DDIMER 560 on 4/15/21 due to h/o J&amp;J vaccine and CTA lung 4/29/2021 shows Right lower lobe pulmonary emboli.  Patient is clinically much better. No more SOB. Dizziness a little residual but significantly better. Never had hypoxia/tachycardia and BP always reassuring. Pt read about some blood thinner making clot worse and doesn&#39;t want to to start a blood thinner without checking with hematology first. I&#39;ve prescribed rivaroxaban so that pharmacy can start authorization and ensure coverage, but patient strongly states that he will not take it yet until hearing from hematology.

The patient went to sit in the waiting area and fell off his chair. Pharmacy staff rushed to him to find him on the floor conscious and speaking stating he was okay. The patient was assisted to stand and get on a chair. At that point Orange Juice and Water were provided to the patient and the pharmacist sat next to him for ten minutes. Next, the patient was instructed to stay for five more minutes to make sure he was okay. The patient stated this happens to him every time he gets a vaccine and it isn&#39;t out of the ordinary at all. Patient also stated he did not eat or drink much all day besides a bag of chips and on top of that was doing strenuous work in the heat all day and this could have contributed to his collapse.

                                                I had some head pressure - dull headache each day for a couple of weeks starting about five days after vaccine; I didn&#39;t notice until the evenings when I was relaxing. From day 5 or so - for about two weeks I noticed this head pressure. My blood pressure did rise  at that time-it was elevated - within about two weeks after the shot, I couldn&#39;t control my blood pressure. I went to the doctor  - they had to raise my blood pressure medication to the max because I couldn&#39;t get my blood pressure down and I even donated blood.  Today I am at 135 over 90 which is good for me but at that time  when I noticed the rise after the vaccine - I was running 165 over 115 . I&#39;m still taking the maximum blood pressure medication that I can take currently but it is at a good level currently. I was taking 20 mg pills and after the vaccine we tried to raise it to  25 mg and then raised it up to 30 mg and then they finally said up to 40 mg a day. It&#39;s the most I can take.   I have chest pains on the right side of my chest -it will start (on a scale from 1 to 10 -  it&#39;s about a four) - it&#39;s shooting pain - in my chest for about 10 minutes and then it will move to my left side - not my pecs -  it feels like it&#39;s my  heart. It&#39;s not enough that I feel like I&#39;m having a heart attack - it happens about four days a week. It doesn&#39;t last real long - but it&#39;s intense. A &#34;4&#34; pain for me is intense. It goes on for about 5 minutes - switch sides and then another five minutes - I try to relax/watch tv during that.  I did have leg pains in the middle of all of this time - hand, inner thigh, then on my right leg - single spots of pain that moved - like ant bites - that happened in the beginning - at day five and after - the same time I was getting the head pressure. I would rub over the spot with my hands and then it would go away and go to a different spot.

                                                DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS; This spontaneous report received from a consumer concerned a 49 year old male. The patient&#39;s weight was 80.3 kilograms, and height was 182.9 centimeters. The patient&#39;s past medical history included post-operative deep vein thrombosis (more than 30 years ago), depression, heart murmur, and back surgery, and his concurrent conditions included non-smoker, no alcohol use, and marijuana abuse. The patient had no history of known allergies. The patient&#39;s mother had a history of aneurysm.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: unknown, and expiry date: unknown) dose was not reported, administered on 08-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. Concomitant medications included fexofenadine hydrochloride (Allegra) for allergy, rivaroxaban (Xarelto) for venous thromboembolism, and omeprazole (Prilosec) for unknown indication. About one and half weeks after vaccination, on 21-APR-2021, the patient was taken to the emergency department and was admitted with the complaints of leg pain since 2 days with suspected blood clot in leg. Over the last days, patient&#39;s left leg looked swollen compared to the right leg. The patient also had pain, initially started in groin area and radiated down across the anterior portion of the leg, then to posterior leg, and into toes. The patient also had some intermittent tingling in toes. The patient denied of weakness, numbness or persistent paresthesia. The patient was concerned regarding the pain as it felt similar to the post-operative deep vein thrombosis he had in the past. The patient had been anxious since vaccination when hearing about the development of blood clots. The patient also denied of fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and difficulty walking. On 21-APR-2021 16:25, the patient&#39;s laboratory data included: Blood pressure (148/66 mmHg), Body mass index (24), Body temperature (98.8 F), Oxygen saturation (100 %) Pulse rate (88), and Respiratory rate (16). On 21-APR-2021 16:32, laboratory data included: Blood pressure (148/66 mmHg), Body temperature (97.8 F), Oxygen saturation (100 %), Pulse rate (91), and Respiratory rate (15). Other general physical examinations included: General: Well-developed well-nourished in no acute distress. HEENT (Head, Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat) examination:  normocephalic atraumatic extra ocular motions are intact. Neck examination: Supple without jugular vein distention or meningismus. Lung examination: Clear auscultation bilaterally without wheezes rales or rhonchi. Heart examination: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs rubs or gallops. Abdomen examination: Soft no tender non-distended without rebound or guarding. Extremities: Without clubbing cyanosis edema, no lacerations or abrasions or ecchymosis noted, no appreciable size difference in the left leg compared to the right, the patient had some tenderness throughout palpation of the medial thigh on the left with radiation up into the left inguinal region, no calf tenderness or swelling, no erythema, palpable posterior tibialis pulse. Skin examination: Warm and dry and well perfused. Psych examination: Appropriate mood and affect. Neuro examination: Cranial nerves 2-12 are grossly intact, strength is 5/5 in upper and lower extremities, full distal sensation in the left lower extremity, full plantar and dorsiflexion of the left foot including the left great toe, sensation is grossly intact, awake, alert and oriented x3.  On ultrasound Doppler venous lower extremity test, identified sub occlusive thrombus in the left superficial femoral veins, likely related to organizing/chronic thrombus, however no prior imaging was available at the institution for comparison, no evidence of occlusive deep vein thrombosis. The final diagnosis was made as Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).  At no time the patient had ever endorsed any chest pain/pleuritic pain, shortness of breath or exertional dyspnea. Due to the nature of this clot, a course of anticoagulation was planned. Patient was prescribed with Xarelto at twice daily starting doses, with transition to 20 mg doses. During the initiation of treatment, the patient should be followed up by his primary care physician for further evaluation. The patient stated that he would call the primary care physician in the following morning for follow-up appointment. The patient was discharged from the hospital on APR-2021. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The outcome of deep vein thrombosis was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged, and Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: 20210457179-Covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s-deep vein thrombosis. This event is considered not related. The event has a compatible/suggestive temporal relationship, is unlabeled, and has unknown scientific plausibility. There are other factors more likely to be associated with the event than the drug. Specifically: MEDICAL HISTORY

                                                First, pain around the injection site; it appeared within a few hours after the injection, but it was bearable.  Then, after about 23 hours after the injection, bad headache (especially around the eyes - which also caused light sensitivity) and general malaise. Shortly thereafter, low-grade fever (99.5 F) and significant muscle pain, all over the body.  The most worrisome side effect was the last one, which appeared during the second night after the injection (about 32-33 hours after the injection): extremely fast heartbeat / racing heart.   I did not use any treatments for these side effects.

                                                I received the Johnson and Johnson Covid 19 vaccine on 4/6/21 and the dose code is 041AZ1A. I received it at the Community Center.  I&#39;m writing because beginning with the evening after I received the Johnson and Johnson Covid 19 vaccine I&#39;ve been having abdominal / stomach cramps and stomach pain. Sometimes it is on the top of the abdomen / stomach, other times it&#39;s at the bottom. Sometimes it hurts to the point of waking me up in the middle of the night. This morning it started moving into my chest.  Do you know if this pain will subside shortly or what is known about this potential side effect? Is there anything I can do to mitigate the issue?  I&#39;m contacting my Dr for a visit.

                                                A week and a half after taking the Janssen COVID shot I had a knot and pain come up in my lower back. After going to the chiropractor two times the knot and pain ended up in my right leg. I then went to Urgent Care where they diagnosed me with a large blood clot. They sent me to imaging and after scanning the area confirmed that there was a blood clot in my right leg. Urgent Care then set me up with a specialist.

I also had irregular heart beat for 16-18 hours. I have had neurological issues with 2 other medications in the past which calmed my concerns. I had my arms lock up on me while on Humira and I had the exact facial numbness and tingling with Enbrel. Both of those drugs work through TNF cells. I do not know the mechanism with J&amp;J vaccine but wanted you to know that.

The patient&#39;s height and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included high blood pressure and diabetes.  The patient received COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S (suspension for injection, route of administration not reported, batch number 1802070, expiry date unknown), dose not reported, 1 total administered on 19-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination on left arm. Concomitant medications included amlodipine besilate for drug used for unknown indication, empagliflozin for drug used for unknown indication, fenofibrate for drug used for unknown indication, insulin aspart for drug used for unknown indication, insulin glargine for drug used for unknown indication, losartan for drug used for unknown indication, and pioglitazone hydrochloride for drug used for unknown indication. On an unspecified date (reported as 22-MAR-2021; 28 days prior to vaccination), the patient experienced shortness of breath, heart rate increased, runny nose, chills and was hospitalized (date unspecified). He reported that on this past Saturday, 17-APR-2021 (2 days prior to vaccination), he went to the emergency room. He reported that his toenails were coming off, the skin on his toes was coming off, and he had swelling in his right foot and up his leg. He says there was no circulation going to his toe and he was diagnosed with having a blood clot in his right leg. He says he had surgery to open up the arteries in his leg, and also reported gangrene in his toe. The subject was discharged on 21-APR-2021. On 23-APR-2021, the patient experienced feeling hot. He also reported that he may need to have his right pinky (fifth) toe amputated because it has gangrene. He reported that he is going to go back to the hospital, to which he would seek medical attention if he was having issues. Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included paracetamol. When called back due to his vaccination dates being after event start dates, the patient said that his memory is not too good, so he &#39;had to take his time to remember the correct dates&#39;. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S was not applicable. The patient was recovering from blood clot in leg, and had not recovered from runny nose, shortness of breath, heart rate increased, chills, feeling hot, gangrene in toe, right leg swollen, and right foot swollen. This report was serious (caused hospitalization).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 50-year-old  hypertensive and diabetic male patient reported that he was feeling hot and may need to have his fifth toe amputated because it has gangrene 4 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and 2 days after discharge form the hospital.  The patient was hospitalized for shortness of breath, heart rate increased, runny nose, and chills 28 days prior to vaccination.  The patient went to the emergency room 2 days prior to vaccination because his toenails/skin on his toes were coming off, swelling in his right foot and up his leg, gangrene in his toe; he reported that there was no circulation going to his toe and was diagnosed with having a blood clot in his right leg; the patient reported he had surgery to &#34;open up&#34; the arteries in his leg. Four days after vaccination, the patient felt hot and reported reported that he may need to have his right pinky (fifth) toe amputated because it has gangrene.  The patient is taking paracetamol as treatment.  No other details was reported.  Based on the lack of temporal association, the causality is considered not related for the events blood clot in leg, shortness of breath, heart rate increased, right leg swelling, right foot swelling, chills, and runny nose.  The information available regarding event gangrent of fifth toe and feeling hot precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

                                                I am diabetic and use a Medtronic Minimed insulin pump. Beginning approximately 4 hours after I received the vaccine my blood sugar increased to unacceptable levels. I immediately began taking extra boluses of insulin to bring my blood sugar back own to normal. I have a chart to use to guide the amount of extra bolus needed to bring blood sugars back down to normal. I followed that chart, which always works, but my blood sugars did not decrease as expected. As a result I took even more extra boluses which lowered my blood sugar nominally but not to normal levels. My blood sugars have continued to be high as of 42 hours after receiving the vaccination.

On 4/6/21 I came home from work about 7:00 am due to an extreme headache and muscle weakness. By the afternoon my fever was up to 101. On 4/7 my fever went up to 102.7 and I was shaking uncontrollably, sweating , dizzy, headache, and had heaviness in my chest. I felt as if I were going to have a stroke. The headache was excruciating. I took acetaminophen 500 x 2 and 400 mg of ibuprofen, and Theraflu to try and alleviate the symptoms. On 4/9/21 my fever broke, but the weakness, dizziness and headaches have continued. I currently have ongoing headaches and dizziness. I have not gone to the doctor because I do not have a PCP. I am looking for one now.

He was transferred to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a flesh eating bacteria in the right leg where the pain was at and Sepsis.  He was taken to surgery to debride the right leg and was started on CVVHD because his new kidney was now failing, he eventually was started back on Hemodialysis and taken to surgery 2 more times where he cardiac arrested on the table in surgery and died.  A private autopsy is being performed but the preliminary results shows he had multi-system organ failure, including his liver which was NEVER a problem in the past.

                                                Patient initially presented with meningitis-like syndrome with altered mentation, fever, headache, neck stiffness and found to have multifocal brain (predominantly brainstem lesions).  He was initially started on empiric meningitis coverage (ceftriaxone, vanc, ampicillin, acyclovir) which was stopped when CSF tests/cultures returned negative and he improved. Around 10 days later he then developed Guillain-Barre syndrome with ascending weakness of legs and inflammation of cauda equina nerve roots and inflammatory involvement of spinal cord as well causing weakness, numbness, autonomic dysfunction (cardiac arrhythmias) and urinary retention. He was treated with 5 day course of IVIG and improved enough to go to acute rehab. Diagnosis was ultimately concluded as atypical Bickerstaff&#39;s encephalitis or idiopathic inflammation of the brain, spinal cord and nerve roots without no other causative event identified other than recent vaccination

We quickly checked his temperature however it was within normal range. We applied cold packs to his wrists, forehead, and face for about 12 minutes. I checked for normal capillary refill and asked him questions to assess his mental status. About 20 minutes after starting the treatment, patient started improving. He returned almost back to normal in about 30 minutes.

                                                Approximately three weeks after receiving Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, I began to get pains in legs. Calves were aching and throbbing. Didn&#39;t think anything of it at first....just thought achy muscles and such. The day before Easter (April 3rd 2021) decided since the pain was continuing and the internet will scare you to death - I went to a local Emergency Room in advance,  I had an ultrasound on my left leg and it was noted I had DVT. (blood clot in left calf)  To briefly explain: I had an achilles issue back in Nov. 2020 (slight micro tear - achilles tendonitis) I thought maybe this was related to that, as I had not been to the doctor to get it checked until early March 2021. and it bothered me off and on for a few months. I thought the calf pain may have been related to that?  I explained to the emergency room doctor about my achilles and thought it was an issue related to that. They decided to perform an ultrasound on my left leg. Which noted the DVT/Blood Clot. They put me on a starter pack of Xarelto and I am to follow up with my normal doctor on April 22, 2021.

Mindset went back but still could not speak too much. 4/2/21, Fri night.  After bible study at night, almost all bro &amp; sis said that was symptom of stroke, and suggested us to see emergency doctor.  On 11pm, we were at emergency room.  4/3/21, Sat. I was admitted 1-2 am into impatience room. CT diagnosed a big gray area in between speech are and spine. 4/3/21, Sat afternoon. MRI and MRA had been tested.  Cardiologist said he could not rule out the last option, which was due to slow heart beat 50-60. But I have slow heart beat since I remembered things from 4-5 year-old. He suggested wearing a heart monitoring device for a 4 weeks after discharged.  4/4/21, Sun noon.  Doctor admitted to discharge. They could not find cause, and would like to follow up within 1 to 2 weeks after discharging.  4/13/21, Tue night, I started wiring body monitoring device.

By 8:00, I was feeling tired enough that I went to bed early.  By 9:00, I had terrible chills and body aches throughout my body.   The aches were worse in my chest / torso -- maybe from so much shaking.  I did not watch any of the men&#39;s championship game that night.  I also felt nauseous but I seemed to lack the strength to vomit.  I can not remember a time when I had so much physical pain in my life.  My hands felt numb / tingling.  I tried to drink some ginger ale but drinking was difficult.  Although I was aware that I was breathing and my heart was beating, I thought that I might die.  The terrible pain continued for a few hours.  Around 10:30 PM, the pain dissipated.  However, after about 10 minutes of relief, the pain returned, perhaps worse than before.  At around 11:30, my wife came to bed.  She suggested that I try relaxing Yoga breathing.   I did that and the pain stopped and I fell asleep.   The next day, I woke up with a typical headache and took more Tylenol.  I continued to improve the remainder of the day.

Went to urgent Care on 4/8 where treated for severe dehydration and stomach aligment.  From 4/9 - 4/14 continued to suffer from same symptoms and then began to have heart taching, feeling as if there was a bubble in my chest.  Went back to Urgent Care on 4/14 and was again treated for dehydration.  Outcome is that no one knows why I have been feeling this way except for that it is a direct result of receiving the vaccine.

We thought it was related to the weather getting warm and we work the night shift, so he rested and increased his water intake. He was able to go to work on Monday night and return home and continued to rest on Tuesday. On Tuesday, there was no numbness, but there was weakness in both his legs. On Wednesday, he felt weakness throughout his body, especially in his legs. On Thursday, he collapsed. He did not lose consciences but his legs gave out under him and he was not able to get up up. He was taken to the hospital. He was diagnosed with a stroke, increased sugars (diabetes he has never had before), acute kidney injury, and uncontrolled increased blood pressure. He was hospitalized and discharged April 19, 2021. He was readmitted 04/24/2021 for another stroke.

We arrived early and he received the vaccine at 12:15pm, waited 30 minutes for reaction and he was feeling fine. Later that same evening, the patient was driving to work on the freeway when he felt a dry throat so he coughed hard, at that cough he felt a massive pain in his head, like his &#34;head was going to explode.&#34; He immediately had tunnel vision closing in on him, so he pulled over and later woke up in our parked car with flashing emergency lights on, parked on the shoulder of the freeway. Disoriented and confused why he was there, he looked at his watch and saw he lost 15 minutes when he had passed out. MY HUSBAND COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED IF HE HAD NOT PULLED HIMSELF OVER WHEN PASSING OUT. Today we reported this to our doctors office and to you!

                                                Received the vaccine on 4/4/2021.  On 4/8/2021 started having pain in lower left leg.  Pain off and on for two weeks.  Pain intensified on 4/23/2021.  I went to the emergency room where they performed on ultra sound examination of my left leg.  Confirmed that I have a deep vain thrombosis (DVT) behind my left knee.  Prescribed Eliquis.  Saw Dr. today.  He could not confirm that DVT was caused by vaccine, but I thought I should report it.  I am to stay on Eliquis for six months at which time I will be evaluated for a blood clot disorder.

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805029 expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, administered on 15-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. No concomitant medications were reported. On 15-MAR-2021, the patient received the vaccine, waited at facility for 15 minutes, and everything was okay.  On 17-APR-2021, the patient experienced neck ache, muscle ache and felt a sense of tiredness, headache, sleepiness, which he treated with Aleve (naproxen sodium). He also noticed his feet had a rash from his knee to feet, and according to his sister (who is a healthcare professional) it looked like small micro-embolisms (thrombocytopenia). The patient went to his physician who said the spotty red dots could be petechiae caused by thrombocytopenia.  As recommended by his primary care physician, the patient has an appointment for lab work, including platelet counts, on 20-APR-2021. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from headache, tiredness, neck ache, rash from knee to feet (red dots), muscle ache, and possible thrombocytopenia, and the outcome of sleepiness was not reported. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 53-year-old male patient was found to have petechiae-like rash on his knees to feet, that according to attending physician could be caused by thrombocytopenia, 2 days after receiving Janssen COVID-19 vaccine for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The patient underwent laboratory procedure including platelet count (results not reported).  The patient complained of neck ache, muscle ache and felt a sense of tiredness, headache, sleepiness that he treated with Aleve (naproxen sodium) on the day the petechiae-like rash appeared.  No other details reported.  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information as requested.

This happened before 25 years ago and is likely unrelated to the vaccine. Expected cold/flu-like symptoms did occur on March 14 and part of March 15 but things have been fine since then. I&#39;ve followed up with my GCP and am scheduling a Neuro appointment for followup.

By 9a.m. my blood pressure taken at home was 180/110 and started having chest pain on left side.    Went to urgent care where they felt it was a cardiac reaction to vaccine and they sent me to ER.   Underwent EKG and chest xray.   Blood pressure still at same level 180/110 and not going down, migraine still at an 8 out of 10, chest pain still present.    I was given an IV to treat for migraine pain and within a few hours all symptoms had went away.   We started with Urgent Care at about 10a.m. on 4/3/21 and then by the time all was done I was released from the ER at 6:30p.m. on 4/3/21.

Started to feel better in the evening and started to drink a bit of gatorade.  However Saturday morning April 3rd woke up between 6-7am and went to the bathroom and turned around to walk back out and blacked out - most likely dehydrated.   Fortunately did not fall down as my wife caught me slumped up against the wall and got me down to the floor.  After 5-10 minutes was able to get back to bed and after another hour or so was able to start drinking fluids and keep them down through the day.   By late afternoon/early evening had a small meal and was starting to feel better - never did have a fever (checked frequently on Friday and Saturday)

                                                DIAGNOSIS: 1. Superficial thrombophlebitis MEDICAL DECISION MAKING/DIFFERENTIAL DX: Differential diagnosis includes DVT, superficial thrombophlebitis, muscle strain, tendinitis. The patient presented to the emergency department with atraumatic left leg pain. An ultrasound reveals a fairly large blood clot in the greater saphenous vein. Although this is a superficial clot, given its extent, I think it warrants anticoagulation. Per the trial, the patient would benefit from 45 days of 10 mg Xarelto treatment. The patient was given good precautions regarding bleeding risk while on a blood thinner. He will schedule follow-up appoint with his primary care doctor. He will also use Tylenol and warm packs to help with the discomfort from the superficial thrombophlebitis. He was discharged in satisfactory condition.

About 10 hours later I started feeling sick.  One of the first things I noticed besides a headache was my heart rate jumped up to over 100 beats per minute (it is normally below 84).  I started getting chills and fever.  It was worse than any flu fever I ever had and I could not sleep.  Worst part was my heart rate would not go down, remaining above 100 but below 110-115 beats per minute.  I considered calling 911 but after looking online decided not to as long as it remained below 120 bpm.  I don&#39;t know my maximum temperature - I did not think to take it until after the peak had passed by 20 minutes or so (was 99.4 at that point - normal temperature runs 97.2 (low 96.8, high 98.2)).  Heart rate finally started to drop around 3:30 am.

He said he was dizzy. He was at this point dizzy, pale, sweating, low heart rate in the 30&#39;s. We put a cold wet rag on the back of his neck and monitored. We gave him some cold water also. Slowly over the next 5-10 minutes his stats got better, color returned, and was not sweating anymore. He did not feel dizzy anymore.  We monitored for an additional 30 minutes. Gave instructions. Sent home with spouse.

BP had gone down some, so they agreed to proceed. After dose, pt was dizzy, sweaty, unresponsive for a short time. Once he was more responsive, we helped him sit on the floor against the wall as he was quite dizzy. We called 911 and pt refused transport to hospital, but was evaluated.

                                                pt states he told them he was on blood thinner so they had him stay 30 minutes before leaving after taking the vax.  At this time he became nauseated.  He went home and  laid down and fell asleep.  When he woke up he called his PCP because he wasn&#39;t feeling well.  His heart rate was running from 80-90 and fluctuating like he was about to have a heart attack. He was told to call back if he wasn&#39;t feeling better.  On 4/9  his heart  was running about 90-115.  On 4/10 his heart was running from 139-142.  He called his doctors office and they told him to go to the ER.  He went to hospital.   He was given heart  EKG, labs  and IV.  He was given aspirin.  His INR was at 2.  His heart rate came down to 115.   His blood was low.  His DX was Sinus Tachycardia.  He was admitted to the Heart Floor.  He was treated for 2 days and released.  They told him they thought he was reacting to taking the vaccination and to FU w/ PCP.  He said his heart rate is fluctuating  and is currently at 101.  He doesn&#39;t see a Cardiologist since he cannot have open heart surgery due to his underlying health conditions.

                                                Approximately eight hours after receiving the shot, I started getting a headache, body aches, and chills (April 3rd, 8 p.m.).  I went to bed and had severe chills and body sweats for the entire night.  The primary symptom to report is that my heart raced all night.  It felt like it was beating at about 140 to 150 Hz or higher.  When I woke up in the morning, it felt like my chest had been pounded on all night.  The pain was in my sternum area.  The headache and body aches took a little over a day to go away.  The chest pain took a couple of days to die down.  On April 12th, I walked my dogs in the morning and felt out of breath, which isn&#39;t normal for me.  In the afternoon, while working at my desk at home, I started getting more and more severe chest pain and then started getting dizzy and felt weak.  I drove myself to the local ER and they tested me for a heart attack.  All tests came back negative.  They suggested going to another facility to get checked for clots or to make an appointment with a cardiologist.  The next day, after talking to a doctor friend, he suggested going to the ER facility to get imaged for clots and to get fully checked out.  No cardiologist appointments were available till the next week.  I went to the ER facility and was there for seven hours getting tested.  They came back and said all test results were negative and that my heart looked fine.  They did not have any suggestions for what might be causing the pain in my chest.

                                                DVT right lower extremity and pulmonary embolism: was hospitalized for 2days with a Heparin Drip and discharged home with Eliquis 10mg twice a day. Home meds discontinued: all BP meds, Ibuprofen, Tylenol, and Torodol. Follow up appointments with Dr. oncologist. Also had to cancel upcoming ventral hernia repair after having to wait 3 years due to complications with bowel obstructions and had to lose weight before surgery due to high risk. Now will have to wait longer until cleared medically, primary physician instructed me that it would be 6months or more before being cleared.

THIS REACTION WAS NOT STATED TO BE COMMON PRIOR TO RECIEVING THE VACCINE BUT PT&#39;S WIFE STATING AFTER HE RECEIVED IT THAT HIS BLOOD PRESSURE IS LOW EVERY TIME HE HAS A SHOT. SO MONITORED THE BLOOD PRESSURE, HIS WIFE GAVE HIM CRACKERS AND WATER, AND WE HELPED HIM LAY BACK. PT BLOOD PRESSURE DID RETURN TO NORMAL AFTER THAT AND WE CONTINUED TO MONITOR HIM FOR ABOUT A HOUR AND A HALF. PT APPARENTLY HAS THIS KIND OF REACTION AFTER EVERY VACCINE AND IS NOTHING SPECIFICALLY TO DO WITH THE COVID SHOT. HE WAS EVENETUALLY FEELING BETTER AND THEY REFUSED TO LET ME CALL AN AMBULANCE SO WE HELPED HIM TO HIS CAR IN A PUSH CART AND THEY LEFT.

                                                First 4 hours post injection no serious side effects, slight headache was settling in.  At approx. 8PM (7 hours after shot) I had fairly a severe reaction of horror for the next 16 hours - all night long.  Heart racing/energy beyond, deep chills and severe whole body shaking to the point of my back going out (dont&#39; have a bad back), fever, migraine headache so bad (i dont get headaches) and body aches from a horror movie.   I&#39;m a jock, run daily, healthy, no smoke, drink or drugs. This lasted all night long well into the morning. At 3Am i considered going to the ER, but didnt. By 2pm the following day most of it went away. Two days later (today) i am dizzy, heart feels fast or racing, naseuous earlier , and exhausted. I can deal with it now, but it&#39;s very uncomfortable. Frankly, I regret getting the vaccine, wish i had not.   I had covid last March, it was no big deal beyond what a flu would have done...with some shortness of breath on and off for a few months. The reaction to the vaccine is viccious compared to covid itself (for me, just my experience). Hope this all stops and goes away.   Thank you for your work!

Duration of blackout unknown. Woke up on floor not knowing how I got there. Sat up, nausea and lightheadedness returned, then dissipated with no further blackout. Felt rush of blood from head to toe and felt okay after that. Pharmacy staff took blood pressure, readings were close to normal (slightly elevated). Paramedics were called by pharmacy, and their BP readings were also close to normal. After all that, aside from some fatigue, no other appreciable side effects over the next 48 hours. No nausea, flu-like symptoms or fever, and very little soreness at injection site.

Slurring words, stumbling around and general unwell feeling with a fluttery feeling in chest. No previous heart issues of any kind. After it continued for an hour or so, I took him to the ER and it was discovered that he was in AFIB. 2 rounds of meds and tests, but stayed in that rhythm. They ended up doing a cardio version and it went back into normal sinus rhythm. Follow up with dr, placed on Eliquis, EKG, stress test and sleep study have found no other contributing factors atthis point.

My PCP scheduled an ultrasound on 3-24-21 where the nurse discovered blood clots in my lower left leg. I started taking Eloquis later that afternoon. I then had an apt with a blood dr. on 4-9-21 where she drew blood for tests. I was experiencing my heart racing and she scheduled me an apt with a cardiologist on 4-13-21 where the cardiologist suspected that the clots had moved into my lungs. The cardiologist did an EKG on the same day. I have a heart echo scheduled for 5-7-21. I am experiencing side effects from Eloquis so 4-19-21 I switched to Xeralto.

                                                The evening of the shot I woke up with pain in my legs near my hips which lasted for a day. On 04/12/2021 my left leg was swollen and painful. I was already taking blood thinner. I went to the Emergency Room the next day and they found a blood clot in my leg. The Thrombosis was behind my left knee. My leg was swollen from the knee down and my ankle was very swollen. My Eliquis dosage has been increased from 2.5mg to 5mg twice daily. I did not have a repeat sonogram but my leg is no longer swollen.

Immediately he drank apple juice and right after still felt like he was going to faint. As he was sitting upright in chair talking his eyes rolled back in his head and he became unresponsive. I had him lie down and propped up his feet. Called 911 and took his blood pressure. He regained consciousness but was still not coherent. He attempted to sit in chair again and immediately felt like he was going to pass out

                                                Approximately 4 minutes after the injection, while sitting down, I felt light headed, sweating, weak, face turned white. I was close to passing out but didn&#39;t. I requested attention after about 10 minutes. While being treated by medics they mentioned color had returned to my face. I felt better enough so I refused to go to hospital and was driven home. Later that morning, 03/08/2021 about 10 AM, I developed a fever and body aches with sharp pains thru out my body and joints. First temperature check was 100.5. My fever, pains/weakness increased thru out that day and overnight with chills. Highest temp check was 102.8 that evening prior to bedtime. I don&#39;t know if it could have been higher at some point overnight. It felt like I had a moderate to bad case of the FLU. The next morning, 03/09/2021 the fever broke down to about 101. By 03/11/2021, aside from a little residual weakness I felt more like myself. However, as of the writing of this report my temp seems to fluctuate between normal and 99.8. Will report this to my Doctor on next visit. Worth noting that I haven&#39;t had any Flu like symptoms to that degree in many years.

Then, without warning, I passed out, while driving on the freeway. Fortunately, I did not hit anyone, or was hit by anyone, and must have bounced off guardrails after crossing traffic twice and going off the freeway into the middle of an off ramp, where I finally came to. I did not suffer any injuries in the accident.

As soon as the event took place my sore throat and swollen glands stopped immediately. My wife took me to the hospital where I was entered into stroke protocol. I was subjected to a series of tests including: EKG, ECHO, Platelet Cnt, Lipid Panel w direst LDL reflex, Hemoglobin, MRI Brain w/o contrast, CTA Stroke Alert (head/neck), CT Stroke Alert Brain, ECG, Basic Metabolic Panel, CBC, Protime - INR, APTT, Troponin I, Covid19, Influenz Influenza A/B, RSV PCR, and POCT GLUCOSE.

I had my blood pressure checked for several days by the school nurse.  The readings were very high 158 over 102 at the start of school and 168 over 104 at the end of the day.  This was constant for a week before I went to the cardiologist for a check up.   The doctor prescribed Amlodipine Besylate 5mg on March 26, 2021 to lower my blood pressure.  It took roughly 10 days to get my blood pressure down to 140 over 85.
