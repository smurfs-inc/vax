(Not normal )  This lasted two days.  Intense chills/shivering. Night sweats, nausea.  This was the night of the injection.  Headache. Everyday since  injection.  Throbbing in left temple.   Muscular pain, left deltoid. This has increased since day of injection.   Redness, swelling, pain  at injection site that has intensified since injection. (No other indicators of it being an infection. Not warm to touch, no oozing or bleeding or any type of fluid.)   Left  forearm  muscle pain, left wrist pain- almost like a dull ache going down arm.

                                                Chills/shaking began approximately 8 hours after injection.  Other symptoms of an achy upper body, temperature of 103.1, and nausea came shortly after initial symptoms (within 1 hr.).    In the middle of the night, I began heavily sweating (something I have never experienced).  I was drenched with sweat and needed to change in the middle of the night.   Absolutely no energy and a horrible headache.    24 hrs. after the injection I no longer had a high fever.  However, consistently for a week, every day, I had at least one symptom (headache, nausea, chills, or lack of energy) at some point throughout the day.  When I received the injection, I was on day 2 of my period.  It ended one day later than normal.  However, what was not normal was that on 4/3/21, I began to bleed again.  I passed 2 clots and had spotting for an additional 5 days.  This is in no way normal to my cycle.

The day before I couldn&#39;t work at my desk due to pain in my low back and hip flexors, which is also abnormal. Then the period was heavier than normal lasted 3 days longer than normal. It looked like there were clots in the blood.   I mentioned this experience to a friend, who said several of his female friends also experienced bizarre periods after receiving the JJ vaccine. Was this drug tested on women of reproductive age before being released?

Patient also stated she recently took the J&amp;J vaccine and didn&#39;t know if her current symptoms were related to that.

It was rather light flow but for a normal duration. 23 days later began another period. It&#39;s early. I am now on day 21 of an active flow. On Day&#39;s 7-9 I experienced extremely heavy flow, soaking overnight pads in a matter of 2 hours, and experience large blood clots. On day 14 I caught medical attention at my normal primary care clinic through their walk-in services.  I was given birth control and told that at my age this was just to be expected. No lab work was performed.

In addition, to the bleeding, there was a lot of lower back pain, pain in the hips and general pelvic region.

Everything but the soreness of the injection site and tightness in the muscles on that side lasted about 48  hours. The tight muscles and soreness lasted about a week.  *** THREE WEEKS AFTER THE SHOT**** Sunday, 4/12/2021 I woke up and stepped out of bed and my left ankle gave out when I stepped down. Internal rotation, weakness in left ankle. It happened again as I walked shortly after. That day I tripped many times due to weakness in that ankle. When I showered and shaved my legs I realized that I had absolutely no feeling in the left lateral part of my lower leg. It felt like I had a novocaine injection in my leg. I could not even feel a pin prick there. By Friday 4/9/2021 I started to have some sensation, but still decreased sensation and weakness in my left ankle even at this moment.  ****4 WEEKS AFTER THE SHOT**** My period started Monday, April 5th, 2 days early. By Friday, 4/9/2021 and through the day and night Saturday 4/10/2021, I had such a heavy period that I kept soaking through tampons, pads, and 2 pairs of jeans. I have never blead like that and could not keep up.

Period cycle started early and was very intense cramps, heavy bleeding, vomiting. To date, the headache, dizziness, light headed, brain fog and fatigue are still being experienced 13 days after being vaccinated. I called a nurse line on 4/16/2021 to talk over my side effects and was told to visit an urgent care center, who then sent me to the ER for bloodwork and an MRI of the brain. Was told all results came back normal, to continue to monitor myself and make an appointment with a primary care physician if I feel the same in week.

It had the appearance and consistency of vegemite or molasses. Black sludge. At first it was extremely heavy with very large black clots. Then it became tiny little black clots suspended in a brown sludge. This continued for 6 days until 04/18. Then on 04/19 my menstruation turned bright red with no clots, but has not abated at all for another 4 days. I am currently today on Thurday 04/22 still bleeding almost 2 weeks after taking the J&amp;J shot. I cannot believe I am still bleeding after 10 full days!!! Never in 30 years of menstruating have I had a 10 day period. I am very scared and upset.

                                                I did have leg injury in April - and ever since the vaccine, I  now have an issue with swelling that won&#39;t stop - still have swelling. I was checked with blood clots - and it was elevated so they gave me an ultrasound in leg - no blood clot. Swelling on right leg was enlarged after the vaccine. Two missed menstrual cycles; now I have had the cycle but it&#39;s a longer cycle than I normally would have. It&#39;s abnormal - the length and flow is off. Spotted for a week before I started bleeding. I had slightly elevated blood pressure after the vaccine - 117/83 usual  but it was elevated 141/95 - and it&#39;s never high ever like that before. So they had thought I had a potential blood clot. Have an upcoming doctor&#39;s appt scheduled.

                                                I woke up 6 hours after vaccination and started getting the chills with a fever of 101.3. I took some Tylenol which brought the fever down for a few hours but it later shot back up to 104. I had a headache, muscle pain, and fatigue. On Monday, I got a sharp pain on the side of my head causing my eyes to hurt. I called doctor who said that it sounded like a sinus infection and prescribed me Azithromycin. Days later the doctor called me and I told him that I wasn&#39;t feeling better and was referred to take a Doppler test which showed nothing wrong. I went to another doctor that prescribed me Bactrim which cleared up my sinus infection and I felt a little better. I still feel fatigued, have brain fog, and double vision. I went to a neurologist and was given a CT scan. That was two weeks ago and I never heard about the results. I&#39;m scared to drive because I don&#39;t know what will happen. The vaccine also threw off my cycle and I have gained so much weight since my vaccination.

It&#39;s now my 5th day and I&#39;m experiencing debilitating cramping more than my normal.  It&#39;s quite worry, because I&#39;m thinking I should be in the emergency room.  Also experiencing heavier than my normal flow.  I&#39;ve had to stay in bed for the past 2 days, unable to get any relief.  All this is very concerning, usually my cramping would cease at day 2 or 3.  This isn&#39;t normal for me to experience this level and duration of pain

Seven days after the vaccine I began having dizzy spells, extreme fatigue and nausea, blurred vision, extreme right head pressure, floaty sensation, numbness and tingling in my right arm and leg, muscle spasms, and extreme anxiety. All things I have never experienced before. And they have persisted daily since they began. My first period one week after the injection was a couple days late and very light and only lasted a few days, which is also not normal roe me. I have short periods of relief and then the symptoms return. It is very scary and I need help. I have been to my pcp several times and the Er. They can?t explain my symptoms.

Second period following vaccine started 30 days after the period immediately prior, but was extremely heavy.  On the last full day of my period, around 11:30 am, my body discharged very large amounts of blood. Soaking through my underwear, my jeans and all over my car seat. I used the restroom shortly after this discharge, prior to getting in to the shower, and upon wiping, realized I had passed a baseball size mass of tissue or gel like substance.   After this ?peak activity?, my period continued as normal and finished the following morning.

Wed 4/14/21 - Sharp pain in pelvis (right and left side) same location I experienced pain the day of receiving vaccine.  Occasionally felt this pain 2 or 3 times / day for 2 days.  Sought medical attention at ED on the advice of our Nurse Call Center.  Was evaluated for blood clots, none found on this day.  CT scan, ultrasound of both legs, blood tests.  Returned home with directions to take Extra Strength Tylenol for headache. Thu 4/15/21 - Shooting pain in random parts of my body, mostly legs and arms.  Experienced throughout this day only. As of 4/27/21, 22 days after being vaccinated, I am still experiencing headaches.  More noticeable when I am exerting myself - walking outside for 1-2 minutes triggers the headache.  Headaches are usually located in the lower back of my head.  Before being vaccinated, I would experience less than 1 headache per month, and they go away within the day.

My menstrual cycles are very regular and this was not normal to start it so soon after the previous one. The cycle that started 3 days after my vaccination was lighter than my normal cycles and only lasted 5 days (as opposed to 7-8).  6 days later, I started spotting again. It only lasted 2 days that time and was very light spotting.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I got the vaccine the evening of 03/23/21. Overnight I noticed my body starting to hurt and felt chills. The morning  of 03/24/21 I woke up with full body aches, chills, and fever over 100 F. These symptoms lasted all day. Fever went up to 102 F.  Recently I have noticed a change in my menses since having the vaccine and I wonder if it is linked. I have been on birth control since last year to control heavy bleeding. It was helping very well. The period I had in April and May were like it was before I started the pill. It was heavy and I had numerous large clots. I will be scheduling an appt with my ob/gyn regarding this change.

The site was also very tender to the touch and remained sore after touch.  Attempted to schedule my annual mammogram on 4/2/21;  I was directed by radiology scheduler to PCP to confirm whether I would need a diagnostic versus screening mammogram due to what I was detecting.  I went to my PCP to  inquire about symptoms on 4/7/21.  By that time, the lumps and soreness was much less detected.  I was advised to schedule a mammogram at least 6 weeks post-vaccination.

Lesser effects followed two days after the vaccine with fatigue, sore arm, armpit, and glands in the injection arm. These side effects dissipated by day 3 status post vaccine administration.

It started off small and then covered my chest, I walked over to the nurses and they called the EMTs. They checked me and my throat to make sure it wasn&#39;t closing up. Within twenty minutes it started to go down (the redness). In an hour I had some tingling all over my body. I spoke with my PCD the day after the vaccine and then physically saw her. Now we are much after the vaccine and I see a neurologist suggested by my PCD, because I have random numbness in my fingertips and body and I also experience a lot of fatigue, very tired regularly. I also had a delayed menstrual cycle for about a week. I also felt cramping on my fingertips and toes.

                                                I suffer from a genetic condition called Hereditary Angioedema.   Prior to preventative medicine (Tahkzyro) availability, I treated each attack acutely with Firazry/Icatibant.   My swelling attacks were rare (no more than 6 times per year, and one injection stopped the attacks.    When Tahkzyro was approved as a prevention (every two week injection), in Oct. 2018, I began to administer this medicine 2x per month.   This eliminated ALL attacks to my extremities, but not to my abdominal area.   Those attacks were reduced to 4/yr, with a recurrence of attack within a day of first attack.  Firazry/icatibant had to be injected again (after six hours) and within a day, the attack would stop.  Tracking my triggers, I found consistency in the following (all three situations would have to be present).   1. Near my menstruation cycle. 2. Some viral-like symptom (scratchy throat/allergy, virus/illness). 3. Some stressor (activity, emotional, or weather-related).   None of these things, alone, set off an attack.  They have to occur around the same time.  My Johnson and Johnson vaccine was administered on March 18.   My period was due on April 3.  My period is 95% on time, always.  Depending on the timeframe for PMS/horomones, I would say that the injection was proceeded by my body entering into this phase.   On Mary 21, I experience my first abdominal attack in 6-8 months.  I injected Icatibant and after 6 hours, had to inject again due to a recurring attack.  I ordered a refill on my injections.   On April 2, I travelled to for vacation.  On April 4, I experienced the first of several abdominal attacks.  I ran out of medicine and had to have a new order shipped to my hotel (this had never happened before).   My menstruation was also late.  By April 9, my menstruation arrived, with a flow extremely higher than I recalled ever having in my adult life.   My abdominal attacks also ceased by that point.  I believe that having received this vaccine (which I am told has some form of the virus), during my PMS stage, along with over exerting myself with activities, created the three situations that occur to create a very painful, debilitating, abdominal attack.

This lasted about 4 days on the 2nd or 3rd day I had a swollen lymph node under my left armpit. It lasted just a couple of days. On 3/21/2021 I missed my period I did not get it the month of march. Now on the month of April I first started spotting on April 7th it was very light then it went heavy till this day 4/13/2021 I&#39;m still bleeding which is not normal because my period normally only lasts for 4 days. On 3/31/2021 I also had chest pain that lasted for 4 days then it started subsiding. On 3/12/2021 and on 04/11/2021 I got a weird abdominal pain that lasted for less than 5 minutes.

I contacted a friend doctor stated that doesn&#39;t sound right might be a blood clotting issue.  I went for a visit on 4/13 in the clinic doctor said it seem ok. I was also exp nausea, headache and pain lower left leg. I went to the hospital on 4/14 had Blood Work, Ultrasound (legs) tests results was fine. Also still exp inflammation feeling in my legs a if I have lifted weights and tightness in my calves. I couldn&#39;t walk exp muscular pain, stiffness  between 4/14-/4/16. I normally have my menstrual 3-4 days for some reason it started over again on 4/10 for 10 days. I&#39;m not sure if this was some sort of hormonal reaction. My normal daily activities have been limited I usually walk every morning with my husband since vaccine not able.As of 4/19 my headache is gone the pain is not as bad in legs.

                                                I received my shot around 5pm on April 7th at the pharmacy. My left arm was a little sore and I felt a bit woozy but aside from that everything seemed okay. Approximately 5-6 hours after my vaccine my period started back up which was strange as I just finished my cycle on Friday, April 2nd. My period was pretty heavy in comparison for the first 3-4 days and then finally stopped again on Sunday, April 11th.  I am 1 week past my vaccine and everything seems fine for now and I hope it continues.

                                                Received Janssen vaccine 4/6.  Started menstrual cycle 12 hours after vaccine even though had just completed last cycle 1 week prior.  Normally cycles are 28-30 days apart.  They have not been quite as regular since Covid and has had some shorter periods between normal cycles.  After the vaccine bleeding was heavier than normal with large clots but by end of last week had changed color and looked like it was ending.  Today had no discharge upon awakening but again has a small amount of bright blood.  Of course, there is concern for coagulopathy related to the vaccination.  No leg pain, no shortness of breath.  Has had HA off and on since had Covid but no worse now than in previous weeks.  Left ear pain has been painful since Covid but now has pain in both ears when that occurs.  Quit taking ibuprofen last week for discomfort and switched to Tylenol.

                                                I received the Janssen vaccine on 3/5/2021.  My first menstrual cycle after the vaccine, which started on 3/21/21, was significantly different than any other period.  I woke in the middle of the night to extreme pain in my abdomen and bled along the floor as I walked to the bathroom.  There were clots in the blood in addition to extraordinarily heavy blood flow.  The period was so significantly different from any other that I scheduled an appointment with a nurse practitioner that works with my primary care doctor.  I asked her to &#34;run&#34; all tests that were available and approved by insurance, which she did.  All came back normal.  Due to the significant difference in my period this month, the ARNP  requested an inner-uterine ultrasound which found the below:

After that day everyday I woke and it grew, inflamed, it was firm lump to about inch and half near injection site, and grew overnight larger it was red, swollen and painful. Called my dr on 05/02/2021 and did not hear back from him at all. The lump ended up being the size of my hand, I placed iced on it, and it has went down. Each day since, I have iced it and it  has gone down each day. During this time, my period it was very heavy flow for  8 days, then it stopped then began again 9 days later and lasted 7 days heavy flow again.

                                                On 04-24-2021 I had four days of extreme headaches that would not go away so I went to the ER where I got checked out. Also on 03-28-2021, I woke up with extreme left leg pain. I had difficulty holding things with my arms and I almost collapsed to the floor due to my left leg pain and weakness. I also had heavy menstrual bleeding with giant clots for the Month of March 2021.  I can say today I have no symptoms of my left leg or headaches today.

Menstruation delayed about 2 weeks.    Menstruated (very light ) for a few days ( usually 7 days) then mensuration stopped for a week  and resumed for a few days.   I had no other side effects at all &amp; usually do very well with vaccines.  I wasn?t going to mention it - figured- no big deal due to my age (possibly pre-menopause), but then a friend told me that 2 of her co-workers (RNs) had experienced noticeable changes to their cycle as well &amp; I figured I should report it - thinking of younger women &amp; reproduction.  My cycle has been unpredictable since - maybe menopause- but observed the coincidence

During course of evening nausea, neck, shoulders and lower jaw severe ache by morning. Small sores (the little bubble kind) similiar to mild food allergy broke out on inside bottom lip only and passed only when soreness left lower jaw near late afternoon. Felt better by 5pm. Slight muscle aches in left arm, shoulders &amp; tiredness remained through following day April 2. As of today, 4/12 - I&#39;m having the heavy flow menstral cycle of a freaking teenager. Not fun. I&#39;m accustomed to a very light period at my age not the uteras ripping heavy flow of those first 20 years. Hoping this is a one time deal.

I also had a low grade fever of 99.8 - 100 that lasted up until about 5 days ago. I started having bruising and leg pain, the bruising would be if someone helped me get up, I have little bruising dots over my body.  I went to the ER 3/16/2021 because the stomach and headache pains, they did a MRI and Ct and said it was acute stomach pain and migraines and told me to see a OBGYN for the bleeding and gave me meds for stomach pains. Bentel for stomach and Floraset for headaches but it never worked. I had a nerve block on my head for the migraines but it didn&#39;t work.  The GYN gave me something to stop the bleeding and she&#39;s wants to do a D&amp;C. I&#39;m waiting to see my PCP on the 19th.  I still have the purple dots and headaches, I still get the contractions and the stomach issues have settled some.

                                                Should have started menstrual period anywhere from 3/18/21 to 3/22/2021, but did not get until 4/1/2021, which was 39 days from the previous period.  Normally get them about 25 days apart.  Then got it again on 4/19/2021.  So it appears the vaccine gave me irregular periods, which I read has happened to others, so I am reporting it.  Could be coincidence, but thought I should report anyway.

The pains lasted for about 12 days. Pain in my chest and breasts occurred yesterday and lasted about 2 minutes.  Nipples are tender.

But then my period lasted two weeks every day (non stop) - too long (usually 3-5 days). I emailed my primary care doctor. April 15th - period became heavier; it lasted 3 or 4 days like and then it became less. I saw OB/GYN - she said it is almost stopped so she said my exam was normal. I still had my period two more days but then it stopped. In total, It lasted 2 1/2 weeks, it has never been that long before.

This bleeding includes huge clots, some so large that they have to be ?pushed? out...some clots are the size of a small fist.  The bleeding is consistent and has several episodes of gushing causing blood to overtake feminine hygiene products and spill all over clothing/furniture. During this bleeding clots can be felt passing as well even when seated.  The clots have subsided somewhat compared to when this first started and bleeding appears to be slowing somewhat in the past day.

                                                I?ve been experiencing unusual menstrual changes since I received my J&amp;J dose on April 8th.  A few weeks after the vaccine I was experiencing PMS symptoms (breast tenderness, hormone imbalance, breakouts, light cramping etc) and today I began what appears to be my first day.  I was menopausal &amp; my last period was December 2018.  This is unusual.

                                                8 hr post vaccine, typical side fx (fever, headache), but also significant bi-lateral leg cramping and spasms that continued for 6-8 hours.  Spasms were prominent in inner thigh/groin and down entire legs.  Legs were not movable (heavy), difficult to get out of bed or walk.  Very strange and nothing like this ever experienced before shot. Fine next day.  Around 4/9, pain began in ball of R foot in the AM, hard to walk.  Over next few days, pain extended up to medial posterior calf (very painful), back of knee and groin.  Unexplained bruising on lateral calf.  4/20 woke to swelling of R leg (ankle, posterior knee, groin), went to Urgent Care that night and was sent directly to ER for DVT symptoms.   ER Ultrasound showed no clot, was sent home.  Pain continued to increase, with burning and difficulty walking.  Second Ultrasound done 4/22.  No clots found.  Pain continued to worsen, with swelling/aching on front of calf and severe foot pain.  Veins/skin tender.  Painful groin spasms happen again, same as night of shot.  PCP ordered ABI and spine Xray.  ABI was normal.  Xray showed same issue as 29 yrs ago (prior known L5S1 anterolisthesis; have not had back pain for many years...when I did, it was localised to spine and sciatic in the L hip, was not at all similar to these current issues in R leg.  perhaps related if inflammed, but is vastly different in symptoms and unlike past history).  Saw Vascular Surgeon 4/30, ordered abdominal CT Abdomen Pelvis w IV Contrast.  results normal. arm bruising at IV and blood draw site.  Saw second Vascular Surgeon 5/4 who felt pain related to inflammation response and ordered CBC.  Platelets 178. (patient had requested this test starting on 4/20, this was the first doctor to order it).  Pain continued but some relief found with compression socks.  on 5/10 US Bilateral lower extremity venous duplex with reflux study was done on both legs.  No DVTs, but damaged valves and reflux in the external iliac common femoral vein and femoral veins proximal segment (worse in R leg)  and great saphenous vein at the sapheno-femoral junction (R only).  These areas are where the spasms are happening but doctor not able to conclude relation, wants neuro consult, could be nerves causing spasms. Doctor prescribed compression socks for venous insufficiency concerns, to be rescanned annually for life. Vascular test results don&#39;t explain severe pain in calf and foot and referred to Neurologist for 5/28 visit.  As of today, 5/22, pain is persistent.  Pain/swelling is reduced with use of compression socks but returns without them; walking is difficult in the AM and PM hours; night time spasms.  Have also had shooting pains in L calf, both forearms, and ribs (back).  These occur mostly in the evening (nerve?).  Taking magnesium &amp; extra vitamin D seems to help some. On strict anti-inflammatory diet.  I&#39;d really like some guidance for treatment and what to do about boosters - do I switch to an mRNA vaccine?  I am a very healthy active 49 yr old woman who felt fine before the shot, and now I&#39;ve been in a lot of pain, working greatly reduced hours for almost 4 weeks.  Please advise on what can be done to help.  Concerned about permanent damage and how to handle future vaccines.  (also of note:  first menstruation period was skipped after the shot, second period came a week late and was very heavy with bright red blood.  I am normally extremely regular, mod-heavy flow;  also, the J&amp;J shot I had was a &#34;last shot of the day&#34; extra dose.  I was offered it while having a routine physical.  Could it have been improperly stored, as the last leftover dose?  Very unlikely since it was a doctors office, but including this info)

Called my OBGYN, they said let it run it&#39;s coarse and they had they had many similar phone calls. I take a Nuva ring for birth control, I was concerned about estrogen and the blood clots.  I did not feel well at all for about a week after my vaccine, everyday around 4pm I would get really bad headaches for about 3-4 weeks. I was nauseated and sweating.

                                                The night of the vaccination (3/8), my body felt very hot (not fever) like it was going to catch on fire.  I took Tylenol to be safe and went to bed taking it as a sign that the vaccine was working.  I thought I was mostly over the next day, but four days later on 3/12, I started bleeding only two weeks after my last period, and the it was quite different than usual - very fresh blood and lots of it.  This continued for 15 days at time with very heavy flow - I bleed non-stop, and I worried that I was going to bleed to death.  The worst adverse effect happened 10 days after the vaccination on 3/18.  Out of blue without anything unusual, I started feeling very dizzy, nausea, and vomiting.  After much vomiting, nausea stopped, but the dizziness just got so bad, I couldn&#39;t move or even keep my eyes open (things were spinning even with my eyes closed).  I couldn&#39;t even stand up by myself.  This most horrible severe vertigo lasted two and got gradually better.  It took about 5 days before I felt safe enough to be alone by myself.  During this time, I had a excruciating headache on my left side.  It was so bad, I quickly took some painkillers which knock me out for a day.  The important thing is that I don&#39;t ever get headaches; this is the first one I had aside from one I had when going through IVF more than a decade ago.

I didn&#39;t know what it was as I hadn&#39;t considered it to be PMS. The next day, day 14 post vaccine, I got my period and ended up in bed with lower back pain, heavier than previous bleeding and headaches. Today, is day five of the menstrual bleeding. While the bleeding is lessening, the cramps and headaches are not. This is not typical for me based on my recollection of PMS/MS. I am concerned that the cramping and headaches have not subsided and I am concerned as to why I am having a period after 13 consecutive months of nothing.

                                                I had a very heavy period starting on the 6th and it was clotting, it was overly heavy. That continued about a week and stayed heavy. I also started getting hot flashes every five minutes and those would come and go all day long. I was dripping all day long. Those lasted a week about a week too and then they were done and I haven&#39;t had any more. I had a full physical before I took a trip and I told my doctor about these symptoms. I didn&#39;t have another period until May 26th  which was a normal one and on that same day, my breasts swelled super big. Almost double the size. On the 27th of May, I went to the doctor. He ordered a mammogram and an ultrasound. That was on the June 2nd. I had those done at the hospital They found huge cysts, one was five inches long, on my breasts, (both) full of them all of a sudden. About a week later, those cysts went away and everything was fine. My breasts went down to normal size.

I alerted my Dr today in an online note form about this as I find it odd and very unexpected. I have had fatigue but otherwise no additional adverse events.

Around 6:00pm the same day I received vaccine, I started getting chills and strong aches in my back and legs. I felt very dizzy, lightheaded and sleepy. Chills were gone by the next morning, but aches and sleepiness continued for 4 days. Dizziness and lightheadedness continues til now. A little over a week after vaccination, I had random bruising on my legs on the same side I received vaccine. My lymph nodes were visibly swollen and my breasts felt extremely tender. Bruises are still healing, but lymph nodes and breasts seem relatively normal now, exactly 3 weeks after initial vaccination

I also have just recently read about the severe blood clotting happening in women and deaths related to this vaccine. I&#39;m very concerned and have an appointment with my doctor on 3/19 to check my blood platelets.

Hopefully will be over within a few days.  Since this in not listed as possible side effect I wanted to report especially in light of the inflammation women are experiencing with mammograms.  I know two other women in same situation but with Moderna.  Clearly, the vaccine is effecting female hormones (estrogen, progesterone or FSH, lutenizing hormone).  I&#39;m still happy to have the vaccine and advocate for it.

It is very heavy, and I am passing big clots. It looks like a tablespoon (or sometimes bigger) and it looks like dark red jelly. I can feel it moving before it plops out. I haven&#39;t experienced this type of clots since I first had babies (since more than 26 years ago.)

I had on and off headaches. My thyroid then in April 2021 - it swelled (I had another auto-immune flare up). My neck gets really thick feeling and kind of swollen. In May, on and off, I had symptoms of my legs falling asleep more often. My vision has gotten worse in the last three months. It is a little more blurry. I had a lot of breast tenderness happen. I went for a mammogram. My anxiety and depression is off the charts and I&#39;m able to manage things pretty well usually. I talked to someone this morning and a therapist, too. Thinking what to do given insurance.  I had been discounting the symptoms because I was not thinking it was vaccine. It has increased a lot in the last three months, though, all the doctoring and symptoms I have had. I&#39;ve felt out of whack; exhausted a lot and have put on a lot of weight. It&#39;s still all happening.

It burns and is the worst in the mornings when I wake up.  It is extremely tender to the touch.  I also have a hardness in the lower legs.  The other issue I started experiencing is a one day menstrual period every week since the shot.  Thirdly, I have an odd peanut size bump on my left hand middle finger right under the nail that is squishy.

                                                after receiving shot, I waited 30 min, because I had bells palsy in the past  (about 16 years ago) it was an extra pre caution, approximately an hour later I felt slight dizziness which was not a concern for me  and passed quickly.  approx 2 or so hours later i got a bad stomach cramp similar to a bad menstral cramp however I am menopausal so this was unusual.  I believe it happened 2 or 3 times, that afternoon and maybe once the following day but never again.  The next day after my vaccine 04/04 I experienced a very low fever, came and went most bothersome was the chill and tiredness i felt by evening,  by 04/05 every symptom was gone just a bit of sore arm.  I was away on vacation when I heard the news about the pause and was concerned because I had stomach cramps .  These cramps were just after the shot and came and went quickly so maybe not much of an issue.  Upon return from my vacation last night, I blew my nose and there was blood in my right nostril.  it was not a flowing blood and I think it may have just been caused by the dry air in the airplane?  it was approximately 5.5 hr flight.  Maybe not related but thought I would mention it.

The second menstrual 04/14/2021)  cycle I had a heavier than usual flow, not as heavy as the March cycle, but no cramping.  The first flow was so unusual and the cramps were so bad that I contemplated going to the emergency room.  While searching google I read an article that said unusual menstrual cycles was on of the side affects of J&amp;J Covid Vaccines

                                                I am on menopausal replacement estrogen and take progesterone a few times a year to force a &#34;period&#34;. While on progesterone I dont have bleeding until I stop the progesterone I got the shot and had my period while ON the. progesterone..  Usually because I am menopausal I have 2 days of light panty liner bleeding.  I was taking my progesterone (May 18-may 28) and got the vaccine on May 21.  By May 25th I started a heavy period with significant bleeding and clotting.  The heaviest period I ever remember in my life.  It was heavy flowing . while in the shower or on the toilet.  Very strange never experienced anything like it before.  other symptoms cramping etc were normal level based on the bleeding.  Day #6 still have some bleeding but mostly over at this time.  As a pharmacist I am aware of other possible clotting disorders so I am watching and looking for other adverse events within the next few weeks to assure I have no other problems.  So far besides exhaustion it seems like the  vaginal/endometrial bleeding is  the only issue.

I had a full hysterectomy in 1999, 21 years ago. Alarmed. I took myself to urgent care. I was tested for a Urinary Tract Infection and a Yeast Infection by pelvic examination. Both tests were NEGATIVE. I was prescribed Diflucan 2 doses 150mg each to take 3 days apart. I discontinued the Diflucan upon learning of the negative result for yeast. April 10, 2021 I was still experiencing Vaginal bleeding upon waking up. April 11, 2021 the spotting had ceased.

After 4 days of that I got a really super heavy period with cramping and blood clots in my menustral flow.  It was a horrible period, while the one after the surgery in Feb was very light.  Dizzy and fatique  10 days after shot on the April 8 I took a fall from a chair outside, and from Thrusday to the Saturday  10th I ended up in the Emergency room with a concussion and head symptoms including dizziness and nose bleeds.  This was from a simple fall, and i suspect the covid shot might have caused complications after the fall with additional swelling and brusing.

Dr said I&#39;m having an inflammatory response to vaccine and they have referred me to a rheumatologist (gave me a referral) - joint pain and itching hasn&#39;t gone away at all. (The really bad rash on my neck, upper chest and torso and back on day three - that rash is gone but that tingling and itching of having the rash hasn&#39;t  gone away.) I&#39;m working still but I&#39;m working from home - so that has been okay - although some days I feel worse then others.  I noticed yesterday that my breasts were swollen/lumpiness. Was born with fiber cystic breasts - since menopause that has gotten better but now this feels like it did back then - feels like it did when I was going to start my period. I haven&#39;t had a period since five years ago. Eye sensitivity: Normally have dry eyes but it&#39;s worsened. I have to put drops in multiple times of day. I literally wake up in the middle of the night with almost a sandpaper feeling in my eyes and have to put drops on them. I have been doing acupuncture - it will be my third time today - it helps with stress and the anxiety from these symptoms.  They wanted me to take steroids - I&#39;m trying not to do something like this because I am so sensitive to these types of things.

                                                Few days before April 8 there was a nervous breakdown trying to find my phone to leave on time to work.  I knocked over shelves and smashed the printer.  Then I noticed that I started my period cycle Thursday morning.  I have not had my cycle in over four years.  It only lasted a few days and was very thin and watery.

May be totally unrelated to the vaccination. Just wasn&#39;t sure, so that is why I reported it.  Maybe started about 1-2 weeks after vaccination. Tenderness still remains at this time - not any worse than it was a week ago. Mostly tender to touch. They do not hurt otherwise.  My doctor stated she did not want me to get a mammogram until after seeing me first.  No redness/swelling noted. No fever.
