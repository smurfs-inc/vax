(Not normal )  This lasted two days.  Intense chills/shivering. Night sweats, nausea.  This was the night of the injection.  Headache. Everyday since  injection.  Throbbing in left temple.   Muscular pain, left deltoid. This has increased since day of injection.   Redness, swelling, pain  at injection site that has intensified since injection. (No other indicators of it being an infection. Not warm to touch, no oozing or bleeding or any type of fluid.)   Left  forearm  muscle pain, left wrist pain- almost like a dull ache going down arm.

                                                Chills/shaking began approximately 8 hours after injection.  Other symptoms of an achy upper body, temperature of 103.1, and nausea came shortly after initial symptoms (within 1 hr.).    In the middle of the night, I began heavily sweating (something I have never experienced).  I was drenched with sweat and needed to change in the middle of the night.   Absolutely no energy and a horrible headache.    24 hrs. after the injection I no longer had a high fever.  However, consistently for a week, every day, I had at least one symptom (headache, nausea, chills, or lack of energy) at some point throughout the day.  When I received the injection, I was on day 2 of my period.  It ended one day later than normal.  However, what was not normal was that on 4/3/21, I began to bleed again.  I passed 2 clots and had spotting for an additional 5 days.  This is in no way normal to my cycle.

The day before I couldn&#39;t work at my desk due to pain in my low back and hip flexors, which is also abnormal. Then the period was heavier than normal lasted 3 days longer than normal. It looked like there were clots in the blood.   I mentioned this experience to a friend, who said several of his female friends also experienced bizarre periods after receiving the JJ vaccine. Was this drug tested on women of reproductive age before being released?

Everything but the soreness of the injection site and tightness in the muscles on that side lasted about 48  hours. The tight muscles and soreness lasted about a week.  *** THREE WEEKS AFTER THE SHOT**** Sunday, 4/12/2021 I woke up and stepped out of bed and my left ankle gave out when I stepped down. Internal rotation, weakness in left ankle. It happened again as I walked shortly after. That day I tripped many times due to weakness in that ankle. When I showered and shaved my legs I realized that I had absolutely no feeling in the left lateral part of my lower leg. It felt like I had a novocaine injection in my leg. I could not even feel a pin prick there. By Friday 4/9/2021 I started to have some sensation, but still decreased sensation and weakness in my left ankle even at this moment.  ****4 WEEKS AFTER THE SHOT**** My period started Monday, April 5th, 2 days early. By Friday, 4/9/2021 and through the day and night Saturday 4/10/2021, I had such a heavy period that I kept soaking through tampons, pads, and 2 pairs of jeans. I have never blead like that and could not keep up.

Period cycle started early and was very intense cramps, heavy bleeding, vomiting. To date, the headache, dizziness, light headed, brain fog and fatigue are still being experienced 13 days after being vaccinated. I called a nurse line on 4/16/2021 to talk over my side effects and was told to visit an urgent care center, who then sent me to the ER for bloodwork and an MRI of the brain. Was told all results came back normal, to continue to monitor myself and make an appointment with a primary care physician if I feel the same in week.

It had the appearance and consistency of vegemite or molasses. Black sludge. At first it was extremely heavy with very large black clots. Then it became tiny little black clots suspended in a brown sludge. This continued for 6 days until 04/18. Then on 04/19 my menstruation turned bright red with no clots, but has not abated at all for another 4 days. I am currently today on Thurday 04/22 still bleeding almost 2 weeks after taking the J&amp;J shot. I cannot believe I am still bleeding after 10 full days!!! Never in 30 years of menstruating have I had a 10 day period. I am very scared and upset.

It&#39;s now my 5th day and I&#39;m experiencing debilitating cramping more than my normal.  It&#39;s quite worry, because I&#39;m thinking I should be in the emergency room.  Also experiencing heavier than my normal flow.  I&#39;ve had to stay in bed for the past 2 days, unable to get any relief.  All this is very concerning, usually my cramping would cease at day 2 or 3.  This isn&#39;t normal for me to experience this level and duration of pain

All things I have never experienced before. And they have persisted daily since they began.

I have short periods of relief and then the symptoms return. It is very scary and I need help. I have been to my pcp several times and the Er. They can?t explain my symptoms.

The site was also very tender to the touch and remained sore after touch.  Attempted to schedule my annual mammogram on 4/2/21;  I was directed by radiology scheduler to PCP to confirm whether I would need a diagnostic versus screening mammogram due to what I was detecting.  I went to my PCP to  inquire about symptoms on 4/7/21.  By that time, the lumps and soreness was much less detected.  I was advised to schedule a mammogram at least 6 weeks post-vaccination.

Heavy clots of menstrual discharge were observed. It is not yet known whether these side effects will continue for my next menstrual cycle. Lesser effects followed two days after the vaccine with fatigue, sore arm, armpit, and glands in the injection arm. These side effects dissipated by day 3 status post vaccine administration.

                                                Later on that evening I started feeling tired, chills, &amp; fever. This lasted about 4 days on the 2nd or 3rd day I had a swollen lymph node under my left armpit. It lasted just a couple of days. On 3/21/2021 I missed my period I did not get it the month of march. Now on the month of April I first started spotting on April 7th it was very light then it went heavy till this day 4/13/2021 I&#39;m still bleeding which is not normal because my period normally only lasts for 4 days. On 3/31/2021 I also had chest pain that lasted for 4 days then it started subsiding. On 3/12/2021 and on 04/11/2021 I got a weird abdominal pain that lasted for less than 5 minutes.

I was also exp nausea, headache and pain lower left leg. I went to the hospital on 4/14 had Blood Work, Ultrasound (legs) tests results was fine. Also still exp inflammation feeling in my legs a if I have lifted weights and tightness in my calves. I couldn&#39;t walk exp muscular pain, stiffness  between 4/14-/4/16. I normally have my menstrual 3-4 days for some reason it started over again on 4/10 for 10 days. I&#39;m not sure if this was some sort of hormonal reaction. My normal daily activities have been limited I usually walk every morning with my husband since vaccine not able.As of 4/19 my headache is gone the pain is not as bad in legs.

                                                I received my shot around 5pm on April 7th at the pharmacy. My left arm was a little sore and I felt a bit woozy but aside from that everything seemed okay. Approximately 5-6 hours after my vaccine my period started back up which was strange as I just finished my cycle on Friday, April 2nd. My period was pretty heavy in comparison for the first 3-4 days and then finally stopped again on Sunday, April 11th.  I am 1 week past my vaccine and everything seems fine for now and I hope it continues.

                                                Received Janssen vaccine 4/6.  Started menstrual cycle 12 hours after vaccine even though had just completed last cycle 1 week prior.  Normally cycles are 28-30 days apart.  They have not been quite as regular since Covid and has had some shorter periods between normal cycles.  After the vaccine bleeding was heavier than normal with large clots but by end of last week had changed color and looked like it was ending.  Today had no discharge upon awakening but again has a small amount of bright blood.  Of course, there is concern for coagulopathy related to the vaccination.  No leg pain, no shortness of breath.  Has had HA off and on since had Covid but no worse now than in previous weeks.  Left ear pain has been painful since Covid but now has pain in both ears when that occurs.  Quit taking ibuprofen last week for discomfort and switched to Tylenol.

                                                I received the Janssen vaccine on 3/5/2021.  My first menstrual cycle after the vaccine, which started on 3/21/21, was significantly different than any other period.  I woke in the middle of the night to extreme pain in my abdomen and bled along the floor as I walked to the bathroom.  There were clots in the blood in addition to extraordinarily heavy blood flow.  The period was so significantly different from any other that I scheduled an appointment with a nurse practitioner that works with my primary care doctor.  I asked her to &#34;run&#34; all tests that were available and approved by insurance, which she did.  All came back normal.  Due to the significant difference in my period this month, the ARNP  requested an inner-uterine ultrasound which found the below:

Heavy bleeding and fatigue. I typically don?t get a period and am irregular so this is not normal for me personally.

During course of evening nausea, neck, shoulders and lower jaw severe ache by morning. Small sores (the little bubble kind) similiar to mild food allergy broke out on inside bottom lip only and passed only when soreness left lower jaw near late afternoon. Felt better by 5pm. Slight muscle aches in left arm, shoulders &amp; tiredness remained through following day April 2. As of today, 4/12 - I&#39;m having the heavy flow menstral cycle of a freaking teenager. Not fun. I&#39;m accustomed to a very light period at my age not the uteras ripping heavy flow of those first 20 years. Hoping this is a one time deal.

I also had a low grade fever of 99.8 - 100 that lasted up until about 5 days ago. I started having bruising and leg pain, the bruising would be if someone helped me get up, I have little bruising dots over my body.  I went to the ER 3/16/2021 because the stomach and headache pains, they did a MRI and Ct and said it was acute stomach pain and migraines and told me to see a OBGYN for the bleeding and gave me meds for stomach pains. Bentel for stomach and Floraset for headaches but it never worked. I had a nerve block on my head for the migraines but it didn&#39;t work.  The GYN gave me something to stop the bleeding and she&#39;s wants to do a D&amp;C. I&#39;m waiting to see my PCP on the 19th.  I still have the purple dots and headaches, I still get the contractions and the stomach issues have settled some.

On 4/8/21 I developed mild mucous vaginal discharge with blood streaks.  Thereafter, I developed tan discharge for a few days.   I&#39;ve continued to have upper GI pain for the next 2 weeks.  I went to the ER on 4/18/21 for lab work up and they performed a right upper quadrant Ultrasound. I have a GI appointment today for further work up.

                                                Should have started menstrual period anywhere from 3/18/21 to 3/22/2021, but did not get until 4/1/2021, which was 39 days from the previous period.  Normally get them about 25 days apart.  Then got it again on 4/19/2021.  So it appears the vaccine gave me irregular periods, which I read has happened to others, so I am reporting it.  Could be coincidence, but thought I should report anyway.

But then my period lasted two weeks every day (non stop) - too long (usually 3-5 days). I emailed my primary care doctor. April 15th - period became heavier; it lasted 3 or 4 days like and then it became less. I saw OB/GYN - she said it is almost stopped so she said my exam was normal. I still had my period two more days but then it stopped. In total, It lasted 2 1/2 weeks, it has never been that long before.

This bleeding includes huge clots, some so large that they have to be ?pushed? out...some clots are the size of a small fist.  The bleeding is consistent and has several episodes of gushing causing blood to overtake feminine hygiene products and spill all over clothing/furniture. During this bleeding clots can be felt passing as well even when seated.  The clots have subsided somewhat compared to when this first started and bleeding appears to be slowing somewhat in the past day.

                                                The night of the vaccination (3/8), my body felt very hot (not fever) like it was going to catch on fire.  I took Tylenol to be safe and went to bed taking it as a sign that the vaccine was working.  I thought I was mostly over the next day, but four days later on 3/12, I started bleeding only two weeks after my last period, and the it was quite different than usual - very fresh blood and lots of it.  This continued for 15 days at time with very heavy flow - I bleed non-stop, and I worried that I was going to bleed to death.  The worst adverse effect happened 10 days after the vaccination on 3/18.  Out of blue without anything unusual, I started feeling very dizzy, nausea, and vomiting.  After much vomiting, nausea stopped, but the dizziness just got so bad, I couldn&#39;t move or even keep my eyes open (things were spinning even with my eyes closed).  I couldn&#39;t even stand up by myself.  This most horrible severe vertigo lasted two and got gradually better.  It took about 5 days before I felt safe enough to be alone by myself.  During this time, I had a excruciating headache on my left side.  It was so bad, I quickly took some painkillers which knock me out for a day.  The important thing is that I don&#39;t ever get headaches; this is the first one I had aside from one I had when going through IVF more than a decade ago.

                                                I have not had a period or any period related symptoms for 13 months and had considered myself, by definition to be in Menopause. 13 days after the vaccine  I started having lower back pain, cramps and headaches. I didn&#39;t know what it was as I hadn&#39;t considered it to be PMS. The next day, day 14 post vaccine, I got my period and ended up in bed with lower back pain, heavier than previous bleeding and headaches. Today, is day five of the menstrual bleeding. While the bleeding is lessening, the cramps and headaches are not. This is not typical for me based on my recollection of PMS/MS. I am concerned that the cramping and headaches have not subsided and I am concerned as to why I am having a period after 13 consecutive months of nothing.

I alerted my Dr today in an online note form about this as I find it odd and very unexpected. I have had fatigue but otherwise no additional adverse events.

Around 6:00pm the same day I received vaccine, I started getting chills and strong aches in my back and legs. I felt very dizzy, lightheaded and sleepy. Chills were gone by the next morning, but aches and sleepiness continued for 4 days. Dizziness and lightheadedness continues til now. A little over a week after vaccination, I had random bruising on my legs on the same side I received vaccine. My lymph nodes were visibly swollen and my breasts felt extremely tender. Bruises are still healing, but lymph nodes and breasts seem relatively normal now, exactly 3 weeks after initial vaccination

In 8 days I started another period which lasted 7 days. 5 days later I just started my period again. It&#39;s been less than one month and I&#39;ve had 3 periods which is completely abnormal for me. I also have just recently read about the severe blood clotting happening in women and deaths related to this vaccine. I&#39;m very concerned and have an appointment with my doctor on 3/19 to check my blood platelets.

My vaccination was around 12pm on Thursday, March 11, 2021 and Friday evening, around 8pm, I began to spot and the next few days to present, continue to have a period.  Hopefully will be over within a few days.  Since this in not listed as possible side effect I wanted to report especially in light of the inflammation women are experiencing with mammograms.  I know two other women in same situation but with Moderna.  Clearly, the vaccine is effecting female hormones (estrogen, progesterone or FSH, lutenizing hormone).  I&#39;m still happy to have the vaccine and advocate for it.

                                                after receiving shot, I waited 30 min, because I had bells palsy in the past  (about 16 years ago) it was an extra pre caution, approximately an hour later I felt slight dizziness which was not a concern for me  and passed quickly.  approx 2 or so hours later i got a bad stomach cramp similar to a bad menstral cramp however I am menopausal so this was unusual.  I believe it happened 2 or 3 times, that afternoon and maybe once the following day but never again.  The next day after my vaccine 04/04 I experienced a very low fever, came and went most bothersome was the chill and tiredness i felt by evening,  by 04/05 every symptom was gone just a bit of sore arm.  I was away on vacation when I heard the news about the pause and was concerned because I had stomach cramps .  These cramps were just after the shot and came and went quickly so maybe not much of an issue.  Upon return from my vacation last night, I blew my nose and there was blood in my right nostril.  it was not a flowing blood and I think it may have just been caused by the dry air in the airplane?  it was approximately 5.5 hr flight.  Maybe not related but thought I would mention it.

The first flow was so unusual and the cramps were so bad that I contemplated going to the emergency room.

I had a full hysterectomy in 1999, 21 years ago. Alarmed. I took myself to urgent care. I was tested for a Urinary Tract Infection and a Yeast Infection by pelvic examination. Both tests were NEGATIVE. I was prescribed Diflucan 2 doses 150mg each to take 3 days apart. I discontinued the Diflucan upon learning of the negative result for yeast. April 10, 2021 I was still experiencing Vaginal bleeding upon waking up. April 11, 2021 the spotting had ceased.

All those tests came back negative.

After 4 days of that I got a really super heavy period with cramping and blood clots in my menustral flow.  It was a horrible period, while the one after the surgery in Feb was very light.  Dizzy and fatique  10 days after shot on the April 8 I took a fall from a chair outside, and from Thrusday to the Saturday  10th I ended up in the Emergency room with a concussion and head symptoms including dizziness and nose bleeds.  This was from a simple fall, and i suspect the covid shot might have caused complications after the fall with additional swelling and brusing.

                                                Experienced an unusual headache on about April 8th.  It felt like it was behind my left eye, and in front of my left ear. Pain subsided in about an hour after resting. On April 28th, I experienced vaginal bleeding.  I awoke to a dry cough and felt the leakage.  The blood was bright red and I&#39;d estimate 4-6 Tablespoons.  I feel light-headed, concerned, but otherwise fine.
