                                                Unusually heavy menstrual bleeding with thinner consistency that started a few days earlier than expected and just two days after receiving the vaccination. Injection site still painful and swollen today. If it is relevant, I also experienced more common effects like severe body body pain and hot flashes beginning several hours after receiving the vaccine, lasting 48 hrs.

I had an ultrasound completed, but I still need to have bloodwork done. The doctor said that everything looks normal from my ultrasound on one side. They couldn&#39;t see the other side because I have a small bladder.

                                                On 03/18/2021 at 03:30AM I had a lot of arm pain from my shoulder to my elbow in my left arm. This lasted until 03/31/2021.  On 03/18/2021 I woke up with a headache that would not go away. Next, at about 03:15PM I was not able to walk for about 10 minutes. Then, at about 05:00PM I started menstruating. At 07:00PM I had severe pain in my pelvic area for an hour and a half. At approximately 08:30PM I passed a softball sized blood clot vaginally.  I bled heavily through the night.  On 03/19/2021 I still had a headache and no energy at all. I continued to bleed heavily all day as well. 03/20/2021 was the exact same as the days prior. 03/21/2021 I was still bleeding heavily throughout the day with no energy. I still had the headache as well. I started feeling dizzy while walking on this day.  03/22/2021 I went to work like normal. I was cold all day. I was still bleeding, headache and dizziness. It was hard to stand for 30 minutes. While climbing the stairs I got very light headed and dizzy. I could not go up the stairs at a normal pace. 03/23/2021 I had the same symptoms all day but I was getting short of breath walking short distances. I still had very little energy and a headache. I also lost all color in my face and hands. I was still cold all day. I noticed some slight swelling in my ankles.  03/24/2021 The symptoms were getting more intense. I was still cold.  I finally took some aspirin for the headache because it was very severe. The medication didn&#39;t help with it. This routine went on for the next week and the symptoms intensified with each day. Throughout this time I was still passing clots that ranged in size from golf/ping pong ball to baseballs. They were very painful when they passed.  The days from 03/25/2021 to 04/01/2021 were all the same as far as how I felt.  On 04/02/2021 I woke up with the same symptoms but now I could not stay awake for anything. I slept on and off all day. I only ate one meal a day because I was so tired and I had no appetite. The headache was getting worse as the days went on. The bleeding was still happening. It was not as heavy as the weeks before, but enough to be painful still. I also started having abdominal pain.  On 04/03/2021 I was seeing stars when I moved too quickly. My heart rate was elevated with shortness of breath along with the rest of the previous symptoms. My headache however was very intense.  04/04/2021 I still couldn&#39;t stay awake on top of all the other symptoms. The dizziness and stars were more frequent. I couldn&#39;t move my head without seeing stars.  04/05/2021 I couldn&#39;t get warm and I still felt the same way. I called and made a doctor?s appointment for Wednesday the 7th. I had all the same symptoms still and they were getting worse. I had to move in slow motion so I could try to function.  04/06/2021 I woke up drained of all my energy and color. I couldn&#39;t shower because of the pain in my body. I couldn&#39;t stand because I felt like I was going to fall down. I could barely stand up straight let alone walk very far. I was shaking from being so cold. I had all the same symptoms from the days prior. I was in severe pain. I couldn&#39;t sit because of the pain in my abdomen I couldn&#39;t stand because of the weakness in my legs. I could barely see anything because of the stars I was seeing. At this point I had no color and I was barely conscious. That is when my family took me to the emergency room.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine, my left arm and left side of my neck and back became very sore and I felt very light headed and dizzy. 7 hours later, the back pain worsened and I started sweating a lot. Soon after my skin all over my body began to tingle as if I had bugs crawling all over my body and it was very uncomfortable. During the night I couldn&#39;t sleep because I was sweating so much, the back pain was getting worse and worse, and the tingly skin feeling turned into very intense skin sensitivity and hurt any time my body touched something or rubbed against my clothing. At some points I would be extremely hot and sweating a lot and then some points I was freezing cold and shaking uncontrollably. These signs all lasted 24 hours and slowly started going away after 48 hours. After 48 hours, I felt much better and back to &#34;normal&#34; but couldn&#39;t help but notice some strange reactions that I still have today, 3 weeks later... I have had acne which is uncommon for me. I have had period cramps and mood swings but am not on my period. I also have had crazy bloating in my stomach and all over my body... swollen legs, feet, hands, etc. I also have been experiencing brain fog where I loose my train of thought in conversation, I can&#39;t remember where I put things, I can&#39;t remember if I took my eye contacts out or not, or fed the dog... very strange and uncharacteristic of me to be so aloof and forgetful but to the point where I have zero recollection of doing such activities.

                                                The day I received the shot, I started to feel severe fatigue, headache, light-headed, and started running a fever about 6 hours after the shot was administered.  The next day (4/6) was worse. Severe fatigue, muscle aches, headache, loss of appetite, fever (101.5 was the highest I notice but seemed to be around 101.1-101.3 all day), and general flu like symptoms. However, I also started experiencing abnormal menstrual bleeding. I am on the Depo shot and have been for some time. Due to this, I do not usually experience any menstrual bleeding so I found this to be a little odd. It was not heavy but it was noticeable and contained quite a few clots.   Day 3 (4/7) was about the same except my fever came down and ranged from 99.8-101.1. Abnormal menstrual bleeding continued. New side effect this day included diarrhea.   Day 4 (4/8) I started to see improvement. No fever (that I could tell). Remaining side effects included mild headache, fatigue, diarrhea, and abnormal menstrual bleeding.   Day 5 (4/9), I had one of the worst nose bleeds I&#39;ve ever had in my life. I apologize for the graphic description but it lasted about 20 minutes and my bathroom looked like a crime scene after. Blood was pouring out of my left nostril and I threw two large clots that were about the size of slug (or slightly larger than a fun size snickers... I wish I had a better way to describe it). I&#39;ve had some bad nose bleeds, particularly when I was on Accutane, and this was worse! The rest of the day I felt like I was improving. Energy levels were better. No fever. Menstrual bleeding stopped. Only lingering side effect was mild headache and mild diarrhea.   Since then I&#39;ve continued to feel better and the diarrhea seems like it&#39;s improving.  Mild headache persists. Only new  item is an annoying twitch in my left eye that started on Monday (4/12).

                                                I have severe, random, and unprovoked bruising covering both legs. I have abdominal pain that has persistent since being vaccinated. I?m dizzy. I?m bleeding in my urine, stool, and vaginally. Period came early (unrelated to previous vaginal bleeding) and is not clotting. Just significant amounts of red blood, soaking through one ultra absorbency tampon an hour. I have a headache. Went to the ER and my platelets were (345) and my blood sugar low. My bp was 145/90 which is high for me, from the bleeding.  They said I have a ?higher chance of being bitten by a shark? than having a side effect. They diagnosed me with a single contusion and sent me home. Have been feeling worse since leaving the hospital.

On 7/13 symptoms of heart palpitations, muscle weakness, vision distortion, and elevated blood pressure began suddenly during work. I have history of stroke caused by thyroid storms. Immediately took atenolol, a beta blocker, and called my endocrinologist to prescribe it for the next 30 days. Switched from armour thyroid back to levothyroxine. Atenolol has caused other side effects, heart palpitations are mild and not gone, menstrual cycle is highly irregular. Waiting 6 weeks from the change to levothyroxine for next thyroid panel, continuing atenolol until thyroid levels are in range.

On April 9th 2021 during a scheduled doctor visit at 3pm both baby and mother were in good health.  On the same evening after the appointment she went for vaccination at Pharmacy and received the J&amp;J vaccine. After receiving the vaccine in about 15 mins she felt like urinating and noticed blood in the urine and felt vaginal dilation. Within the next 15 to 20 mins she started experiencing mild labor pains and contractions. In the next 30 mins she started bleeding and was immediately taken to the ER. In the ER it was confirmed that she was having a miscarriage and the fetus was delivered. She also had to undergo emergency surgery to remove any remaining placenta in the uterus.

Felt lethargic and fatigue for approximately 48 hours after the vaccine. Also had some menstrual bleeding which was brief on 3/5/21, which was the date of the vaccine, and this was not expected. Alternated Tylenol and Ibuprofen after vaccine to help lower fever, and drank fluids.

                                                The adverse symptoms I experienced were abnormally severe/heavy menstrual bleeding and abdominal pain. I was on Day 4 of my menstrual cycle on the day of my injection (April 3, 2021). My menstrual cycle usually starts to go away on Day 4 and concludes by Day 7. But the day after my injection, in addition to experiencing the common side effects of fever, chills, aches, and headaches, I also experienced an uptick in bleeding, which included severe/heavy menstrual bleeding with very frequent and large blood clots. That same day (April 4), I started my new birth control cycle as prescribed. By Day 8 (April 7, 2021), my menstrual bleeding continued to be so severe/heavy that I went to my OB-GYN for testing. The OB-GYN ruled out everything but the vaccine as an environmental factor. It was suggested that I take 600mg of Motrin every 6-hours for 48 hours. My menstrual bleeding continued for several more days until concluding on Day 12 (April 11, 2021) but I am still experiencing abdominal pain.

                                                I was 4 weeks and 3 days pregnant at time of Covid Vaccination. On Saturday 4/10 I began to spot lightly, and  called my doctor on Monday morning, who recommended I come in for a blood test. I received a beta HCG blood pregnancy test Monday 4/12 and Wednesday 4/14. On Wednesday 4/14, I miscarried at 6pm.

Soaking overnight pads every fifteen - twenty minutes for three days while still leaking and dripping blood everywhere. Extreme cramps that I would rate at a 10/10 in pain. Absolutely debilitating.  Day four has been soaking overnight pads at a slower rate but still less than an hour per pad. Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Unable to keep food down but able to keep water down. No fever.

The shivers stopped and I became extremely tired. I got out of the bath and had to climb back to bed because the room was spinning and I was nauseous. I did not have a fever at this time. I was able to go back to sleep. I woke up about 2 hours later sweating and with a fever of 100.7. I slept for another 3-4 hours and woke up symptom free. My morning went on normal. Ate breakfast and hung out. I was tired in the early afternoon and took a 4 hour nap which is not normal but expected since I didn&#39;t get a good night sleep with symptoms mentioned above in the middle of the night.   I also missed my period that month. My period was supposed to start March 30th and it never came. Confirmed I am not pregnant. Period returned in April on normal schedule.

                                                Almost immediately after the vaccine at the injection site I  got a real bad hot sensation.  For about 2 days it was swollen and had localized pain for about 9 days.  I was very fatigued.   And I developed a severe headache the next day that was so bad I could barely stand it.  4/11 I  went to the Primary Care and saw a  dr who took bloodwork and prescribed some iron because she said I was anemic.  But for about the first 3 days after the vaccine the headache pain intensity level was at a 10, then it lowered on its on to about a level 3 but was still there for about 3 more days and after about day 6 the headache intensity returned to a level 10 and on day 8 I went back to the dr because nothing would relieve the pain and the pain was so intense I couldnt bare it.  I had an MRI on 4/21 which came back normal with sinus pressure present and finally about 4/23 the headaches finally subsided.   I also notice  the next 2 menustral cycles  after I had severe cramping and my breast got really tender and sore and I bled longer than usual which is abnormal for me and I also noticed I had developed a cyst in my right breast and had a mammogram performed which did show that I had a large cyst in my breast

At most it will come late but never early. Currently I am going through the worst cramping I have ever experienced and the duration is killing me. Starting when I woke up at 6:30a to now, 3:58p I have had non stop debilitating and fairly consistent abdominal cramping. Now I have had bad cramps a few times in my life, but they won&#39;t ever last over an hour.

At week 6 the baby stopped developing and the pregnancy was lost at week 9. After having a D&amp;C my Doctor, notified me of the amount of miscarriages he?s been seeing in vaccinated women just at his office and asked that I report it.

My estimated due date was Nov. 13, 2021. I went to the doctor to get blood drawn to test progesterone and HGC levels. That evening, I miscarried.   We are doing testing to see what may have caused the miscarriage but I have not had a miscarriage in the past. On Sept 9, 2020 I experienced a chromosomal stillbirth of a baby boy. His death was due to triploidy which is a fatal chromosomal abnormality.

I woke up the following day 3/6/2021 with a slight headache and feeling a little achy. At around 11:00-12:00pm on 3/6/2021 I started having a fever, chills, aches, an increasingly bad headache. For the next 18 hours I had a fever, shaking, aches, bad migraine headache, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. I felt increasingly sick and my lowest point was at around 9:00pm on 3/6/2021 when I vomited. Around 5:00-6:00am on 3/7/2021 I felt considerably better and no longer had a fever. I was exhausted and still had a headache. I was very fatigued for the next two weeks.   I was menstruating when I received the vaccine. My menstruation stopped when I was having side effects for about 2-3 days and then started again.  In addition, I have psoriasis and on 3/7/2021 my skin looked noticeably better than it had looked before I received the vaccine. The psoriasis I had on my hands almost completely disappeared. A few days later, my psoriasis looked worse than I had looked before I received the vaccine. Today 3/29/2021, my psoriasis is back to how it looked right before I received the vaccination.

I have not missed any pills. I have had quite a bit of unusual spotting and it has not stopped since after my vaccine 5 days ago.

                                                On March 6, 2021, I received the Johnson and Johnson Vaccination at about 8:15 am.  Around 7:00 pm that evening I started to experience the normal symptoms that they had advertised. Yes, I felt like I COVID again for about 48 hours, but nothing alarming.   On March 12, 2021, I went to an appointment with doctor due to extreme abdominal cramping and very heavy period.  This is not totally out of the norm due to my infertility, but I felt like something was off. I had random abdominal bruising and ruptured cyst pain; which I am still experiencing. She ordered an ultrasound to rule out a mass in my uterus due to the extreme pain and bruising.   On March 22, 2021, I woke up at 3:00 am with extreme stomach pain and extreme diarrhea.  As the morning went on I began to feel worse and worse. Other symptoms I experienced were; severe headache, shortness of breath, heartburn (I felt like I was having a heart attack), nausea, back pain, and extremely tired.  At 6:30 am  took me to the ER due to my worsening symptoms. Everything checked out fine and they thought I could have an ulcer, but I wanted to make you aware of these symptoms that I experienced.   I still have days that I experience some of these symptoms, but they have been under control and monitored closely.

This second period lasted over a week. So, I had two periods in the span of 1 month. Neither period was expected or coincided with the placebos in my birth control. I do not normally menstruate at all on my birth control pills.

I had nausea at night and I felt flushed. I consulted with  Urgent Care and they asked me to come in and get a COVID-19 test which was negative. Those symptoms lasted a full week. My period is also out of sync and it lasted longer than usual for a total of two weeks. It kept coming and going. It normally only lasts five days and it is consistent. I was also having cramping on my left lower abdominal region.

                                                Severe menstrual cramping. I have never experienced physical pain like this in my life. My first cycle after the Jansen vaccine, I had an acute cramp attack that lasted about 15 minutes. This was in April. I almost asked my partner to take me to the hospital.   During the second cycle I had since being vaccinated, on the first day I started menstruating, I nearly fainted and was seeing stars while trying to get home. I had taken two Advil and this was not enough to help at all. I took two more shortly afterwards. The blinding pain lasted for 20-30 minutes. I can?t express the severity of this pain. It was unprecedented and terrifying.   The rest of my menstrual cycle is different as well. The first day was extremely heavy aside from being alarmingly painful, and then from the second day on, it was very light.  I also believe that I may have developed seasonal allergies post-vaccine as I have never had them in my life. I am currently struggling with this common discomfort.

                                                The day after I received the vaccine I was very ill. I had a fever of 103 for most of 24 hours after the shot. I had body aches and chills and just felt generally horrible. I was 8 weeks pregnant with twins at the time of the vaccine. 3 days after the vaccine I had an ultrasound which showed a large blood vessel between the twins. On March 23rd I had another ultrasound and neither of one of my twins had a heartbeat. From the measurements they could tell that I lost one twin the week of March 15th and I lost the other one the week of March 22nd.

My period was a lot heavier than normal - my cramping went on for two weeks and more. I had clotting and  heavy bleeding - first time clotting. More blood and heavier bleeding then I had ever experienced. It was an Ectopic pregnancy. I just got treatment yesterday so it will be awhile before I&#39;m recovered. I was seeing midwives or OB/GYNs.

Pregnancy was confirmed through home test on May 7, 2021 and with doctor on May 10th, 2021. The doctor referred me to OBGYN and first appointment was on June 9th, 2021. Expected delivery date was January 4, 2022. The first ultrasound occurred on June 10th, 2021. This ultrasound showed concerns of development as I was measuring 6 weeks and should have been at 10 weeks based on the previous dates. A follow-up ultrasound occurred on June 25th and confirmed the baby was not viable. My body was not recognizing the miscarriage and therefore had to go in for a D&amp;C on June 30, 2021.

The period lasted for 13 full days and was the heaviest period I?ve ever had with thick clotting and blood. After that period I went 2 full months with no period. This has NEVER happened to me before.

I did not miss a dose, my cycle has never been early like this (maybe a day early.)  I started spotting hours after I received my shot, on March 8, 2021 and now it is a full blown cycle.  This makes my cycle 9 days early.

By Tuesday evening, 8 pm, I noticed extreme Breast tenderness and I called my doctorand talked to the nurse  - lactation nurses - on the 17th.That persisted for more than 48 hours. (I am breastfeeding.) When I bent over, I had chest pain with that. Told to monitor it and if I got a fever to call back to call the doctor.  Didn&#39;t get fever and my tenderness in my breasts went away and so did  the body aches.

My period is normally 3/4  days and this one was 6/7 days. I also passed 3 golf ball sized blood clots. I have never in my life passed a clot, let alone three that size.  The next cycle I had a tiny bit of break through bleeding the day I ovulated?that never happens. Then this cycled I have felt crampy and bloated. Like I am going to start my period at any minute but do not.  I am expecting my next period in less than a week. But this cycle has been completely abnormal and nothing changed but getting the shot two days prior to it starting.

                                                I found out about my pregnancy the day I got the vaccine (which was after I got the vaccine). After that I proceeded to get a pregnancy test confirmation  (march 26) and it came back positive from the doctors office. On March 28 I began to have bleeding and I passed a blood clot the size of a baseball.  I called the nurse line that next day and they told me they could not give me any medical advice because I had not been seen by a doctor for this pregnancy.  During that week I began to experience a rash that began in the middle of my chest and proceeded to spread All over my stomach and back. It is now April 19 in the rash has continue to spread all over my limbs. On April 5 I went to the pregnancy clinic and was also getting a ultrasound and they were unable to locate the embryo in the uterus. On April 15 I got an ultrasound transvaginal and they were unable to locate an embryo or in a heartbeat. I then went to the hospital the next day on April 16 the hospital that I received my vaccine at and they did not give me any care and told me that my rash was a possible contact to something I may have come in contact recently. I try to express to the doctor that I?ve been experiencing issues since I received the vaccine and he did not connect any of the dots to my experiences.  As of today April 19 I have come across several Different websites that state that red spot is a part of the symptoms an adverse reaction to the vaccine or should be of concern.

I took Tylenol. (Extra Strength) I went back to sleep. I woke up about 08:00 am and I still had chills and was extremely achy and had a really bad headache. My temperature was 101.8. Then I started throwing up every 20 minutes for the whole entire day. I still had a fever. It was 102.6 at one point. I had been taking extra strength Tylenol as often as I could take it. I still had a headache was very very achy. I was throwing up constantly and couldn&#39;t get out of bed. I had my husband come home to take care of toddler. That lasted then for a full 28 hours - through the next evening. When I woke up on April 7 I had a light headache, a little achy but fever was gone. At the time of my vaccine, I was just 8 weeks pregnant. I had an ultrasound when I was seven weeks along they could hear the heartbeat. I had a miscarriage around 8 weeks and four days. It would have been about one day after the vaccine when I was having my reaction to the vaccine. I am still having bleeding from the DMC - removal - but otherwise I&#39;m recovered.  Pregnancy history - It was my second pregnancy. Estimated due date - November 15, 2021.

                                                I have had my menstrual cycle for over 2 months.  It is heavy, I am clotting, and I have spoken to my OBGYN several times and tried to remedy it.  I am on birth control.   They said that Everything inside looks good.

                                                A month after receiving my vaccine my menstrual cycle has not been the same. In April it was very light and I didnt have any breast tenderness and cramping that I normally get. And my cycle only lasted for 4 days instead of the normal 7. In May I still didn&#39;t get any of the normal breast tenderness. I did experience mild cramping throughout the month of May. My period was also late it came at the end of the month. My May period was also short it was 5 days. For the Month of June I didn&#39;t have a period at all. I had mild cramping that lasted for 2 weeks. The cramping started in the middle of June then stopped. And it came back at the end of June and then stopped.

                                                About a week or two after receiving the vaccine, my period started getting heavier than usual. The next period was even heavier. My most recent period started on June 19th and got extremely heavy (1 pad per hour, heavy clotting) in the past two of three weeks. I had my Mirena IUD removed on June 27th, because I thought it was affecting my period. My period slowed for the 3 days it was out, then started heavy again after starting the mini pill. I was bleeding so heavy that I was dehydrated and hospitalized on July 9th. I was drinking a lot of water that day, but eventually threw up and felt like I was going to pass out. I had tingly and cold fingers and toes.  After stopping the mini pill that night, my period has slowed but not stopped.

                                                My first period immediately after the vaccine began 4 days earlier than expected. Since I?ve been on NuvaRing birth control (since 2009), my periods always begin exactly on schedule. Then after my most recent period ended, I experienced a breakthrough bleeding day, which has never occurred any time I have been on NuvaRing. My period ended on June 26, the break through bleeding episode occurred beginning around dinner time on July 4 and ended in the evening of July 5.

                                                I woke up in the night not feeling so well and I was super dizzy and lightheaded when I woke up in the morning, I felt like really spacey. Then I had the worst headache of my life and I was super nauseated. I also had diarrhea and severe stomach pain and I was normally really regular with my period but I started my period about a week earlier and it was heavier and it lasted longer. I had pain with it. I was in such pain and agony. Before that I called the doctor&#39;s office because I had high fever. After that I continued with the high fever and they said it was normal to have it for 1 week after getting the vaccine. Then it went away. I was so miserable, I had to stay in a ball in my living room floor because I could not move because of the pain. When I went to the doctor, they ordered a CT scan and they diagnosed me with pelvic congestion syndrome. They also did blood work. Until yesterday I bought some opioids but I only took one because I do not like to take them. I just having been myself since the vaccine.

                                                Unsure if related. On April 10 had severe cramp/popping sensation and almost passed out. Was ok after but had mild cramping sensation sense and one day of mild spotting on 4/14. Awaiting to see PCP, about events.

                                                Approximately 5 hours after the vaccine I developed a very bad headache followed by chills, sweats, congestion, chest pain, body pain, muscle pain, fatigue and fever. The muscle pain and weakness was so bad I would loose balance when walking. I then started to menstruate clots, not my normal cycle timing,  which lasted about 2 days. The clots subsided but I am still bleeding today. I was in bed for 4 days with severe immune response symptoms. After those symptoms subsided the fatigue was so extreme it was hard to function.

My period blood was brown the whole time instead of red and it had tons of clots. SO MUCH CLOTTING. And then the blood was grainy like it had sand in it. I normally bleed for a reliable 4 days, but this period extended into 8. None of this is normal for me.

Scheduled appointment.   4/14/21 cont. Seen in office by PA for: 1. Left arm pain - tender nodule L forearm, will get US due to recent birth, Johnson and Johnson vaccine, FH of DVT, to r/o DVT causing the lump, await results.  Symptomatic care in the interim, may use warm compresses. - USV VENOUS UPPER EXTREMITY DUPLEX LEFT; Future   2. Paresthesia of left arm - site of reported injection and superficial induration 1.5cm from acromion process, suspect SIRVA due to sit of administration of vaccine, recommend symptomatic care with warm compresses, gentle massage if benefit noted, pt is breastfeeding so recommend local care at this time, consider PT, pt declines at this time as she will be on vacation next week.  Discussed possible cortisone injection but deferred due to recent COVID vaccine 6 days ago, pt agrees as there is some recommendation to avoid steroids in close proximity to vaccinations to avoid blunting the immune response   3. Family history of DVT - see #1 4/15/21 After speaking with the DVT clinic Dr contacted the patient and recommended she take an 81mg low dose daily aspirin, until symptoms resolve, around one month.  And repeating venus duplex in 7-10 days.  Determined she would go prior to her leaving for her trip as she planned to be out-of-town during that time frame.  (Per provider result notes.)  4/16/21 Patient was seen in emergency department for: Patient presents for evaluation of multiple concerns.  Following the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine she was recently diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis in the left forearm by ultrasound, has been taking aspirin and symptoms have not worsened.  Left upper extremity exam is quite reassuring today, I see no clinical evidence for DVT and she is neurovascular intact.  I did not feel that repeat ultrasound was necessary at this time, but she does have this scheduled next week so I advised her to keep that appointment.     She has a very slight headache which has been present since the day she received the vaccine, currently 2/10 without vision or other neurologic concerns.  No abdominal pain.  I have low clinical suspicion for CVST or PVT at this time.  Advised return if she develops worsening headache or new neurologic symptoms.   Patient complained of new onset left lower lateral breast pain and lump starting today.  She is currently breastfeeding and notes decreased milk production today.  She does have a tender fullness on exam but no redness or visible swelling, she is nontoxic and well-appearing without fever.  She has history of mastitis in the past, but she states her PCP recommended she be evaluated for possible blood clot in the breast.  Advised the patient that I have very little concern for that at this time, if anything it would be superficial and not amenable to anticoagulation but I did not feel that imaging was necessary at this time.  I will cover her with antibiotics for lactational mastitis, she has cephalosporin allergy but states she had formal testing for penicillin allergy and tolerated this well so I prescribed Augmentin.  She will use a warm compress and continue nursing, I did recommend she start on the right side to initiate let down on the left.    4/20/21 patient was seen in the office for: Patient presents for follow up of recent ED visit.   She was seen here last week for left arm pain/nodule/paresthesa following her Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. She also reported a slight headache that was present since day of vaccine. An US was performed and showed a left cephalic vein thrombus of LUE. She was advised to start ASA 81mg daily for the next month and get repeat US in 7-10 days. She then called in with left breast pain/swelling and was directed to the ED for evaluation of possible blood clot. She does have hx of mastitis several weeks ago. The ED did not pursue additional imagining of breast, they told her it was likely lactational mastitis and they did prescribe augmentin and warm compresses for this.   Today, patient presents states he feels &#34;a lot better&#34;. Regarding the left breast lump, redness, swelling she states this has completely resolved. She did not start the augmentin as she was worried about this potentially causing thrush for her daughter; she explains she had mastitis 7-8 weeks ago and was on antibiotics and then her and her daughter continually passed thrush back/forth to eachother 3x so she was hoping to avoid this. She did treat with frequent feeding/pupming, and warm compresses and symptoms resolved.    She was told to see us for elevated blood pressure in the ER, per review of EMR and her DC papers, her blood pressure in the ED was 130/75. Today her blood pressure is 122/78.   Regarding her left arm symptoms, she states the numbness/tingling has nearly resolved; she will occasionally get a very mild tingling in her 4th/5th fingers that resolves after a few seconds. She denies pain or swelling of the arm. She no longer can palpate the clot and thinks that it is gone. She no longer feels swelling or tenderness in her left axilla. She stopped the ASA and started motrin/warm compresses as was advised by the ED.    Her mild headache continues since the vaccine but is somewhat improved. She denies worsening or severe headache; denies vision changes, dizziness, lightheadedness, speech difficulty, etc.   Phone encounter also from 4/20/21:  Phone call placed to DVT clinic to get their guidance as Dr had talked with them last week.   Reached RN, who reviewed with Dr. After review of patient&#39;s history/chart/growth of superficial clot, Dr recommended that patient not travel as planned and continue on 81mg ASA daily. They would like us to place a referral so they can see her later this week or early next week. They also want us to place order for repeat US either this coming Friday or Monday and they will coordinate to get this done at their office/same time as appointment.   I did place phone call to patient to discuss and give their advice. They had just left this morning for another state by car. I reviewed Dr advice to not travel and she will discuss with her husband if they are going to run around or not. She was agreeable to continuing on the 81mg ASA  Daily and repeat US/visit with DVT clinic in 5-7 days as recommended.

                                                April 10 - I only had mild pain at injection site; no impact to activities. At 9:40 PM that evening, I started feeling feverish, pain, itching at the injection site (continued for about 6 days); muscles aches (ongoing) headache, nausea, and uncontrollable chills. And I was not able to do anything the next day and that was the 11th. I l also got my period that day. The 12th, my period became a geyser - I never had a period like that before - I was bleeding a lot for about 5 days (my period didn&#39;t last longer than  a normal  period though) ; and I still had some muscle aches (they continued through the 12th). So I gave my PCP a call and went in, and she told me to watch it (she didn&#39;t know I had been vaccinated. I&#39;ve had an ongoing headache this week: on Wednesday (the 21st) - for 22 hours non-stop and Thursday (the 22nd I had another one on Thursday - it was about 6 or 7 hours).

                                                4 days after the vaccine I started having periodic sharp pains in my uterus which made me think my period was coming. 6 days post vaccine I started bleeding lightly and the periodic sharp pains continued. 8 days post vaccine I woke up in the most excruciating pain of my life. It was the most severe menstrual type cramps I have ever experienced. I also had a severe headache which I never get. I took 600mg of ibuprofen. The pain continued for hours and I tried my best to breath through it. When I went to the restroom there was only a little blood but large amounts of fleshy tissue began discharging from me. Later that day when the tissue seemed to slow down the pain began to subside to a tolerable threshold (although still more severe than normal). I then began to bleed heavier than any other previous cycle. Normally I have a medium bleed for 2.5 days. This heavy bleeding lasted 6 days. I felt extremely dizzy and weak. Finally when the bleeding stopped I started to feel myself regain strength over the next few days although the sharp intermittent jabs of pain in my uterus lasted about three days after the bleeding stopped. I now am feeling back to normal and recovered. I never went to the ER but came very close to going during that time.

However, about 6 weeks after my vaccine dose from J&amp;J, I experienced menstruation spotting for the first 2 - 3 days and then it turned into an irregular period. All-in-all, my period lasted about 8 days. Additionally, I experienced extreme cramping leading up to the irregular period due to the vaccine. No treatment was needed but I did consult with a doctor and they assured me that this is a none side effect.

                                                I have had pain in my calves so I stopped the birth control mini pill. My period had also been incredibly irregular, super heavy and clotted bleeding. I?ve felt dizzy and weak on the heaviest days I?ve been bleeding as well.  I?m passing clots - similar to when I?ve miscarried in the past.

She was concerned due to blood clot warning and I advised her to seek additional medical assistance which she said she would seek. She did state in addition, she experienced swollen lymph nodes and breast tenderness which occured right after vaccination and lasted 2 weeks.

                                                I received the vaccine on day 5 of my period.  I take no hormones of any kind and my periods are regularly 5-7 days in length. My period began on 4/6. Instead of beginning to wane, my period started to get extremely heavy and I started passing clots again about 24hr after the injection. On the night of 4/12 I passed an unusually large clot, roughly the size of a hockey puck and felt very faint and weak. I continued to bleed quite heavily until this morning (4/19), for a total of 14 days. I called my obgyn on Tuesday of last week to report the excessive bleeding and that my cervical lymph nodes had become so swollen that it was bothersome to swallow. My Dr said to go to ER if I experienced typical blood clot/PE symptoms and had received no guidance about the effects of this vaccine on menstruation.  I have had mild headaches, sore throat, mild fevers and fatigue as well since the injection

Headache for 3 days (above right eye, caused some vision changes), then sore throat, cough, brain fog, difficulty sleeping, along with body aches continuing.  Currently on day 13 and still have sore throat, coughing, brain fog, difficulty sleeping, muscle aches, congestion.  Also on day 3, eczema has been building on my face/neck.  Eczema has continued to get worse each day.  when I got the shot, I communicated to the nurse, I was maybe pregnant.  it was too soon to test.  That was Friday.  I had a positive pregnancy test the following Tuesday.  I&#39;ve since taken 2 more tests that were positive and have missed my period.  So safe to say i&#39;m pregnant.

                                                I had normal side effects like the flu twelve hours after. The following day I had really bad anxiety and insomnia and my period came early. I could not sleep and I was very anxious. I was very scared and jumpy and restless for no reason. The news of the vaccine safety issues had not been released yet. I went to the ER and I was given anxiety medication. It lasted for a week and I could not sleep at all. I got my period three days after the vaccine and that was three weeks early and it was lighter than normal.. I normally have regular periods. My anxiety has been better and I am sleeping normally.

                                                That evening I had developed a pretty bad headache by that evening but it didn&#39;t go away. I went in to ER on April 19 for migraine because my that time news had come out to seek medical help and nothing was helping my migraine. They gave me via IV - migraine cocktail -  Pregnancy - I think I became pregnant right after the vaccine but I&#39;m not sure. I didn&#39;t know but at the time I was pregnant - and I&#39;m not pregnant anymore. I had a miscarriage about two weeks ago.  Now my headaches are gone. I&#39;ve also been put on between my pregnancy doctor and the two doctors at the hospital - steriod pack pills; Migraine cocktail at first ER; anti-inflammatories at second ER and then Primary Care Dr put me on Prescription nasal antihistamine/steroids  nasal spray and headaches have slowly stopped happening. (My allergies flared up majorly after getting the vaccine. I have) Follow up is still needed on both the head pain - need an MRI and follow up is still needed on the miscarriage - I may still need further medical intervention.   I have had two previous pregnancies - were abortions - both were confirmed to be fine before that. I was scheduled for my first sonogram for my pregnancy - I&#39;m estimating I was probably about 5 weeks.

                                                The day within 10 minutes I started feeling hot and feverish. Then I started to feel lumping and cramping in my left breast and it persists and it turned in to nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. I also felt body cramping and both of breasts became extremely hard and was not comfortable. I also had muscle aches along with a mild fever for about a week. The pain was persistent. Then on day 2, the headaches started and I couldn&#39;t sleep because every time I moved the headache would cause me to vomit. So, I couldn&#39;t. My vision was blurry and I was not sure if it was due to the headache or the vaccine. I ended up going to the ER on 05/16/2021  for cramping in my left leg which was down by my ankle and was bruised. I&#39;m still experiencing heart palpitations, tiredness, cramps still happen in my breasts,  and there are still moments when my vision goes in and out.

My ears were swollen also developed redness, rash on my chest. I ordered Benadryl through delivery for what looked like hives to me. On 06-14-2021 I also developed new allergies that I did not have. My face swelled up and went numb, had tingling sensation to my hands. I went to see my PCP who referred me to an allergist doctor. I also had an allergic reaction to a skin care product that I use. I went to HCF to see a doctor who performed a physical exam. The doctor at the HCF felt my breasts which are so tender to touch, the doctor also could feel the swelling of my lymph nodes in my breasts and also my menstrual cycle is 6 days early this month. To this day the swelling in my lymph nodes are still present and painful. I still continue with fatigue, nausea as before but now I feel its more constant. I do not have my lot# to provide.

Bleeding became alarming over the holiday weekend. OB ordered an ultrasound and it was scheduled for 7/9. I went to OB triage on 7/8 around 4:30 pm. I delivered (miscarriage) on 7/8/2021 at 11 weeks 6 days gestation.  Bleeding has greatly reduced since 7/8.

                                                The morning after the shot, I noticed vaginal bleeding/light spotting. I thought maybe it was just a slight reaction. By the evening, it had become heavier. By the following day, it was heavy and clotting was starting to develop. The Tuesday and Wednesday following the vaccine I had extremely heavy vaginal bleeding and clotting - going through a super plus tampon every hour and a half to two hours. By Thursday it had subsided a bit. By Friday it had lightened tremendously and by the following Saturday it was gone. But then Saturday evening the spotting picked up again. Sunday (3/14) the flow picked up again and by Monday (3/15) it was heavier with small clotting. Today (3/16) it is heavier with clotting again. My gynecologist did an exam and advised that I double my birth control for a few days to see if that will control it. She also took blood work (results not in yet).

                                                Started my period the next day-10 days early. I?ve had regular periods for 2 decades and I?ve never had an early period. Extreme bleeding-appeared to be almost double in quantity and horrible cramping-more than I have ever had with a previous period. I?ve had 2 children and minus the time pregnant and breastfeeding each of them I?ve always gotten my period monthly and occasionally it would be a few days late-but never early. I proceeded to have a bad headache that ebbed and flowed for at least 5 out of 7 days of that week. I am now  39 days out from the start of that period and have not had another period yet-which is also strange.

I felt sore right away and as soon as I got in the car to drive home I was extremely tired and I slept for the entire six hour car ride home. I was very fatigued that night and then I got a bad headache, fever and it lasted for 48 hours. After that, the headache was less intense and they were intermittent but my arm still hurt and I couldn&#39;t lay on it. I was still fatigued for a week. On the fourth day I started to get a weird feeling of vibrations and twitching all over my body. It is especially worse in my temple. It has been a month but I still get the twitching in different parts of my body. My face, arms, legs and temples. It is in different places. It happens less often now, it is not all day but it is still daily and mostly in my head and my legs. I had it happen in my temples last night.  I had my menstrual cycle since the vaccine and it was about three days later than expected. I had a lot of blood clots which was unusual for me. I have had flu like symptoms this week and I have a cough, runny nose and headaches but I am planning on trying to go to the doctor this week.

I generally only experience mild PMS symptoms, and that also for only one day before my period starts. One week before my period was to start I began to experience excruciating PMS symptoms (heavy cramping, excessive mood swings, breast pain). My period did not start on the day that it was supposed to, and I am now four days late. The symptoms have only intensified since then, and over the counter medications have provided no relief. There&#39;s no chance I&#39;m pregnant.

The fetus was measuring 9 weeks 4 days which means the fetus died on 4.22.2021.  4.7.21 - received vaccine shot 4.8.21-4.9.21 - fever (used tylonel), nausea, vomiting I had significant nausea and vomiting the week of 4.11.21 - particularly the end of the week. 4.15.21  - ultrasound (baby measuring 8 weeks, 4 day;  HR -176) I continued to vomit, though I was able to hold more food down. 4.22.21 the fetus would have been 9.4 days which is when the fetus stopped developing 5.11.21 - Ultrasound discovering missed miscarriage  Doctor recommended reporting due to the timing with the vaccine.

A fetal pole is visualized but fetal cardiac activity is NOT present. The fetal biometry is appropriate for gestational age. Anatomic survey is precluded by early gestational age. As the CRL &lt;7mm (measures 2.6mm) a definitive diagnosis of a missed miscarriage can not be made I would recommend a follow up ultrasound in 10-14d.  Follow up ultrasound on 5/27/21 could not visualize pregnancy.  Impression: The endometrium measures 14.39 mm, with heterogenous echotexture suggestive of retained products. The right and left ovaries appear normal.

                                                I have many allergies and adverse events from prior vaccines, so I took a Benadryl before the injection. I was very pleased nothing detrimental happened at the time. My head and neck were a little itchy but went away, some dizzyness but went away, all after about an hour. The arm didn&#39;t blow up like usual.  That night, I started to experience the usual vaccine side effects i.e. headache, feverish, sweating, joint aches. All this I expected starting around 8:45 -9pm.   At about 10 - 10:30 pm, I began to have abdomen pain/pelvic pain... I started feeling like I was getting period cramps and lower intestinal discomfort. I just had my period though, so it didn&#39;t make sense (about 7 -10 days ago). I am also on the pill so I know for a fact I just had it and started a new pack. I was very confused and thought it was odd...can&#39;t be, maybe it would go away.   I woke up about 3am with intense uterus/period cramps which kept me up, in and out of sleep. About 5am I felt like I had my period (fluid down there), went to the bathroom and indeed, I was bleeding... a lot. The cramps continued, the bleeding continued and now 6 days later it is finally going away. I never get head aches and my head has continued to hurt on and off also.

I have an IUD in place (placed in December 2017).  The first 24 hours after receiving the vaccine,  I had mild symptoms of headache, low grade fever and aches from the neck up. 2 days after receiving my vaccine, my period began and continued as a light period until April 14, 2021.  I continued with headaches in the temporal region and experienced light headedness and blurred vision throughout the day (still continues as of today 4/19/21). I went to my primary physician on 4/15/21 and was sent for labs (CBC, CMP, and TSH level), an EKG (after hearing an irregular heart rhythm), and a MRI of my brain. All of my labs and MRI were reported as normal. My EKG showed occasional PVC&#39;s.

It lasted for two days and gradually tapered off. This is not something that has ever happened before and no health problems and/or stressors or outside issues  are related to this experience.  I also have yet to have a period since obtaining the shot and I?m 45 days into my cycle that is always 28 days. There are no other explanations for this interruption. All pregnancy tests are negative and my husband has had a vasectomy.

                                                About one hour after my J&amp;J vaccine, I experienced dizziness. I took a shower and felt chills all over my body and back pain as well. I then  went to sleep and my head started to hurt. My head pain grew in intensity and I felt dizzy. At about 7pm, I started vomiting profusely because of my headaches. I then went to urgent care because I am also diabetic and was worried of how I was feeling. At the urgent care they gave me Paracetamol and nausea medication. My headaches lasted 3-4 days then they went away. Also since I was on my third day of my menstrual cycle at the time of my J&amp;J vaccine, my menstrual cycle got irregular and lasted 5 days longer than my usual 3 days.

                                                I started experiencing flu-like symptoms at around 5 PM on 3/14/21.  I was feverish and had chills, muscle aches, and a headache.  I had very strong chills for a few hours and then I noticed that my resting heart rate was around 128 bpm at around 1:30 AM on 3/15/21.  I was running a 100.6 fever at that time.  My fever subsided in the morning and the headache persisted throughout the day, and I was very tired as I did not get much sleep the night before.  I did not work that day (Monday, 3/15).  At the time I was about 7 weeks pregnant.  I noticed some very light spotting later in the day on 3/15, and then I continued spotting on 3/16.  I consulted a midwife at the  facility at 4 PM on 3/16/21 and took a blood test to measure my hCG hormone levels.  The following day, 3/17, I received the results that I had a normal level of hCG hormone and normal hemoglobin levels.  As the day continued, the spotting turned into bleeding, and eventually the bleeding became heavy starting around 4 PM.  I received an ultrasound on 3/18/21 at 8 AM and later spoke with a midwife from facility at 11 AM that day, confirming that there was no viable pregnancy detected via ultrasound.  I had lost quite a bit of blood at that point.  I am, as of 8:35 PM on Friday,  March 19th, still bleeding and experiencing the impact of miscarriage.

I have continued to menstruate every day since, sometimes very heavy and painfully, even as I continue to take my pills at the same time every day. I am not sure how long this will last. Today is the 6th day.

The blood clots were usually the size of a grape but two of them were golf ball sized, which is unusual for my body. I have bled for a total of 16 out of the 31 days since I had the vaccine. The frequency, amount, and consistency is not normal for my body.

On  4/15  I began to notice pin point non-clustered petechiea  throughout my arms legs and chest.  The number present on  my body appears to be increasing in a random distribution.  No other observable abnormalities at this time.

                                                After receiving the vaccine on 4/8, my next menstrual period has been approximately twice as long as usual. I typically menstruate for 4 days, 5 maximum. This period began about a day earlier than usual on 4/27, and now 8 days later on 5/5, I am still seeing light spotting. My periods are very predictable because of the pill; when I was not on the pill, they were scant, only a few times a year. This includes periods of extreme stress. It is completely abnormal for me, historically and under any circumstances, to be menstruating this long. If it continues through the week, I will see my doctor. I want people to know that this is really happening to women, it is not a simple matter of spurious rumors spreading online.

Now on 5/7 having severely heavy flow again with clotting. Dr. prescribed naproxen and an extra &#34;mini-pill&#34; hormone supplement on top of my regular birth control. Will monitor.

The main thing is that I slept a lot and was unable to work which lasted 9 days. The thing that I went to urgent care for pelvic pain, body aches and pain, developed an UTI and my symptoms cleared at home with medications.  At the urgent care lab work and urine culture was performed. When I went to the urgent care they said I also had tachycardia.  My symptoms have resolved.

                                                The day before she got her vaccine she had started her menstruation cycle.  She is not on any medications, everything was normal, went to work and went to get her vaccine.  She got her vaccine and around 4:15 she started gushing, which is abnormal for her and having clots the size of a half dollar and covered in blood.  This is not normal for her periods, and she is now in the bathroom every hour and a half and looks like a murder scene.  Her normal menstrual cycle is heavy for one day and then gradually lessens and only lasts a few days.   She does occasionally have small clots with hers, but this are large and bleeding profusely.  The only side effect she has is that she is extremely tired.  She slept from 4:30 yesterday to 2:00 AM and feels like she could sleep the rest of the day.   Her arm is a little bit sore, but otherwise fine from the injection site.  Is concerned due to the heavy volume of bleeding, which is extremely abnormal for her.   She has taken Tylenol and drinking a lot of fluids.
