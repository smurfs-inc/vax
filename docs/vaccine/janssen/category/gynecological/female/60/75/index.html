                                                The patient received Janssen COVID vaccine on 3/6 to RIGHT deltoid. She has a past medical history significant for LEFT sided breast cancer, treated with lumpectomy and radiation ~5 yrs prior. Remains on Letrozole. 1 day post-vaccine, she developed fevers (tmax 104), chills, malaise. 2 days post-vaccine, the fevers, chills, malaise dissipated but she developed a &#34;rash&#34; to her LEFT breast (same site as prior malignancy). This rash became a widespread erythematous area encompassing her entire breast. Axilla excluded.  No palpable lymphadenopathy. She reports area to be tender and itching. Rash is blanchable. It is somewhat response to OTC antihistamines (Claritin/Benadryl) and OTC hydrocortisone. She has no respiratory distress, lingering fever, or other allergic reactions. She was given a prescription topical steroid (triamcinolone) and will follow up with her in a few days, if she remains stable. If not back to baseline within the week, will obtain breast MRI for further evaluation.

Not a lot, just several drops, but I have had no vaginal bleeding for many years and it was very unusual. It didn?t persist. I just had it enough to observe and didn?t see it again after changing undergarments.

                                                Whether the adverse events were caused by the vaccine is to be determined.  We are available to discuss more details if this information can be used to help others from experiencing these reactions.  The morning after getting the vaccine, patient discovered that she could not swallow.  As her condition worsened, she was taken to the emergency room.  Over the past month, patient went to the emergency room 4 times.  The last time resulted in extended hospitalization that continues to this day.  In addition to the swallowing problem, two other major adverse events need to highlighted.  First, on 27 March, while in the hospital, vaginal bleeding started.  On 29 March, her doctor, performed a hysteriscopy/DNC finding &#34;  &#34;an unexplained blood clot (hematoma).&#34;  The second major event was when patient demonstrated significant confusion and lack of memory.  On 7 April, she was diagnosed with Metabolic Encephalopathy.  Neurologists at the hospital suspected that her MS was reacting to her UTI and once the infection is eliminated her memory should come back.  But as of 10 April, she was still having issues including hallucinations.  Although she is eating some as of 13 April, she is still very weak and will likely by moved from the Hospital to a rehab facility.  She still does not remember much of the last 37 days.

Then for the next five or six weeks, I had 4 or 5 hot flashes every day (I never had any in my 7 years of being post-menopausal).  I also had a migraine  mid morning every day after the menstrual period. They have lessened now (tapered and mostly stopped by end of June 2021).  I also have slight balance problems now, that are still ongoing.

Had a second urine test a month later. Still had blood in urine. Also had 3 weeks of diarrhea. That was followed by a vaginal yeast infection. Given a prescription to clear that up. Then my breasts became swollen and painful. It has been ten weeks since the vaccination. Saw a urologist  this week there is still blood in my urine. The amount of blood has decreased, but still showing up.

It was located 16 cm from the nipple. Took 10 day antibiotic - relieved the throbbing and decreased somewhat in size but still there. After initial ultrasound a biopsy was insisted upon by all Dr.&#39;s involved. They were very concerned by the looks of the ultra sound images. I insisted on waiting 2 additional weeks. On 4-27 returned for a mammogram and follow up ultra sound. Mammogram was normal and lymph node had decrease 1/2 in size making the Dr.&#39;s agree a biopsy was not needed and most likely the result of the J &amp; J vaccine.

I realized my actual eye color changed from hazel to blue.  As silly as this sounds the color change is not the typical &#34;I was wearing blue, so my eyes looked blue&#34;   It changed from hazel to blue overnight.  The blood vessel healed, the eye color change has remained.  Its pretty but a little strange. It is over 3 weeks.

She said received vaccine on 3/13- then on 3/16 she was seen for one of her breast cancer therapy sessions- they have been treating her for lymphedema - she said she has been going for breast cancer in July- no chemo just radiation- surgery of breast with removal of seven surrounding lymph nodes. She was advised to wear a compression bra- on 3/16 and ever since then her left side of neck has been sore- thought it was likely related to compression bra not fitting correctly b/c too tight &amp; was professionally fitted on her- the straps seem very tight over the collar bone area that was damaged/irritated by the radiation she received on that side up through Oct 2020 for cancer. Now when she saw story today in news she got concerned could the neck soreness really be from a blood clot? She as been going the week for tightness in neck to physical therapy which started yesterday for lymphedema. Again her radiation ended Oct 2020 but she has had persistent swelling in breast &amp; fluid in lymph nodes on the left side. She still has pain in on collar bone- on same side of radiation- blisters, sore, red. As well as this new compression bra having two tight straps on each side. Her COVID vaccine shot in right arm but left side where breast surgery was She went on 3/16 for consultation on breast lymphadema - that was when told her to wear tighter bra for compression on 3/16. She is going today to be fitted for new one that is not so tight. She is approx. 4 weeks post vaccination &amp; post when started wearing that tighter bone- maybe three inches from where had radiation injury is located.
