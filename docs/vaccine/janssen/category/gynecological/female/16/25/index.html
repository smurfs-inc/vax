That same evening I developed the chills, stomach pain. The next day I began experiencing a fever, headache, nausea, light headedness, dizziness, chills, back pain, lock jaw, some numbness on left side of face, zoning out or spacing out. My period also came two weeks early. I had some throat irritation as well as the feeling of being weak and some neck stiffness. All these symptoms seem to have gone away by Sunday evening, if not Monday morning. Except for the back pain, the nausea, and the throat irritation and some head pain and some numbness in face seem to have persisted.

                                                Two days after receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson  vaccine, the patient (myself) awoke in the middle of the night with painful cramps in the lower abdomen. She got up in the morning to some blood in her underwear. The next day, she awoke to an immense of amount of blood coming out of her vagina to the point it was dripping down her leg. For context, the patient received the Mirena IUD several months ago and had not had a period since receiving the IUD, besides spotting. This is why these events were startling since she had not had a period in several months and this immense bleeding and cramping  was abnormal to her. As of today (4/15/2021), she has been experiencing heavy bleeding for 5 days. Again, this is very abnormal to her since she has not experienced a period for several months.

                                                About 9 hours after receiving the Janssen vaccine on April 9th, I started feeling ill. I had a fever of 102, difficulty walking/moving on my own, intense nausea, numbness in my left arm for about 2 minutes, and I spontaneously got my period (which was very regular up until then). I took Tylenol, went to bed, woke up with a 100 degree fever but feeling much better, and it soon dropped back to 98 degrees.  Today, on April 13th, I started having pain in my left arm and leg. Specifically, in my left bicep (not the injection site) and my left thigh. This pain does not feel like muscle soreness, but almost like a knot? I&#39;m not sure how to describe it, but I find it odd the pain in my arm increases a bit when I walk/move.

                                                I?m 22 years of age. I?ve been having periods since I was in middle school. I went on birth control when I was 17 years of age. Since being on birth control (5 years now), I haven?t had a single period where I have had heavy symptoms of cramping, bloating, or any unusual pain. I?ve actually been symptom free since starting the pill. The only trends you?ll see with me is starting to eat more during the week. I just had my first peirod since taking the covid Johnson vaccine and have had a nightmare of a period. I?ve been woken up many nights and times with painstaking period cramps and a whole lot of bloating after eating a single thing. This is being my reported because I haven?t changed a single thing in my lifestyle for my period to go crazy. The only thing I have done is put this vaccine into my system. This has lasted for 4 days. I will be reporting my next Period if I have reoccurring symptoms. With the fear of being infertile down the line, I am again reporting this as it should be documented in my medical records. I also have a doctors appointment lined up to discuss further documentation and help on what to do.

States that night her menstrual flow increased tremendously and became very heavy.  Patient denies any abdominal pain.  Denies cramping.  States is changing &#34;super&#34; tampons about every hour or two.  States &#34;I&#39;ve never bled this much before in my life&#34;  .She is currently on day 6 of menstruation and her periods are usually very light by now.  States &#34;I wouldn&#39;t be worried about this if I was in pain, but it just doesn&#39;t seem normal not to have any pain&#34;.  Patient reports she has been getting lightheaded the past two days.  Not frequently, but she is lightheaded with position changes.  Patient educated that this is a sign of orthostatic blood pressure drop and could be related to blood loss.  Patient informed that it would be prudent to see a healthcare provider to find the cause of her bleeding.  Prefers to hold off for a few days to monitor bleeding before being seen by a provider and has an appointment with PCP next week just in case she needs it.

                                                A couple hours after getting the J&amp;J vaccine, I experienced extreme cramping and a light/medium flow of blood from my vagina. The cramps were very painful - on a scale of 1 to 10, an 8. I have been bleeding ever since. Sometimes there will be only be a drop or two of blood that comes out for a couple hours but usually it is much more than that. It&#39;s like I&#39;m on my period, but I am not. I have an IUD and also am on the birth control pill (Junel). I am not on the placebo week on my birth control pill pack, so I should not be experiencing a period right now, but ever since the shot, I have been bleeding and experiencing intense cramps and pain since.

I have typically been having regular cycles for the last few years (28 days), but this one occurred 14 days after the last ended (March 1), and 15 days before the next started (April 5). It lasted a typical amount of time (3 days). I have been feeling more tired than usual. Could be other factors.

Last night, day 4 the cramps that accompanied the bleeding intensified greatly and were very painful. Today I have much more ?period like? cramping still. Previously cramps were there but minimal and occasional.

                                                About 7 minutes of receiving my J&amp;J vaccine, I started to feel nauseous while sitting down and waiting for my fifteen minutes of monitoring. I experienced pain in my left arm and my heart was beating fast. My vision was in and out, started seeing black and white spots. I then got up from my chair and I went to the counter and as I was talking to the clerk telling her I did not feel good, I just went down and fainted. I had fainted and when I came back, woke up a nurse was trying t put an epi-pen on me but I told her I did not need it. They called the ambulance and they monitored me there. The EMT said to me that my blood pressure had dropped and I had had a &#34;vasovagal syncope&#34; and that my body probably went into shock. I did not go to the hospital and went home. For the rest of the day I felt ill, and out of it. I also felt pain, an aching pain to the right buttocks region. The next day I still felt not good. Also I have noticed since the J&amp;J vaccine, I had my menstrual cycle but normally my menstrual cycle lasts 5 days now this month it only lasted about 4 hours and I this concerns me.  Before this vaccine, I did not have experience these symptoms.

                                                The morning after I received my vaccine I began to have unexpected vaginal bleeding. The Jolessa birth control that I am taking allows me to skip my periods by continuing to take the active pills nonstop and skip the placebo pills, so this bleeding was unexpected, as I do not have a regular period or ?withdrawal bleed? on a regular basis. The bleeding has not stopped and has been consistently a moderate-heavy flow, going on 20 days straight now.

                                                Until ~5PM adverse events were extremely trivial -- mainly I &#34;felt stupid&#34;. Starting about 5PM, I started feeling bad -- stomachache, strong muscle cramps primarily in the right leg (*not blood clot), and I staggered around dumbly much like a severe fever victim (*I had no actual fever). My period started about a week and a half early (typically only varies by a day or two) and was extremely thick and black, tar-like (typically is bloodlike -- reddish and watery). I did not suffer any unusual amount of period pain.  Symptoms worsened sharply between 9:30-10PM, when I became extremely sensitive to light and sound and lost emotional control almost entirely. From 10PM to 4 or 5 AM, in pitch dark and total silence, I laid in my bed raging at the &#39;excessive brightness and noise&#39;.   The next day (5/2) my emotional state returned almost to normal, but I was still &#34;stupid&#34;, and the leg cramps continued. I spent most of the day sleeping. I also drank obscene amounts of tea that I didn&#39;t urinate out, so I would assume that if I wasn&#39;t chugging tea like a frat boy on a keg during spring break, I would have suffered dehydration.  On 5/3 my mental state returned basically to normal. The leg cramps continued. Presumptive dehydration period ended.  On 5/4 the leg cramps began to subside, and my period became more normal (bloodlike, watery). On 5/5 the leg cramps and period ended.
