It?s now a very hard lump that is the largest it?s been .  I?ve been treating with prescription triderm and it is helping some but when I tried clobetasol the opposite happened and it aggravated  the site.  This redness , itching, swelling and warm to the touch has been going on since Sunday evening  and it is not Wednesday night and doesn?t look better yet.

                                                5:00 pm 3-9-21  I became instantly exhausted and had fatigue.  I got chills and ran a 99.8 fever.  I went to bed and about 5 hours later my fever broke and I felt fine in the morning when I woke up.  9:30pm  on 3-13-21 I found both of my thighs bright red.  It was not itchy, but it was warm to the touch.  7:45pm on 3-14-21  My butt cheeks were bright red and warm to the touch.  Then about 30 minutes later my thighs became red.  Everything red started itching was raised like hives.  I found three dots on my arm and later those spread into large spots of hives.  Then over the next 9 hours, a new spot would start, it would spread, then it would itch like crazy.  I took 25mg of Diphenhydramine at 8pm.  I took another 50mg at 10 when I was having no relief and it continued to spread.  At 1:15am both of my hands and wrists had hives and these hurt and itched the most because they were swollen and hard to bend.  At 3am both of my feet started to flair up.  Finally around 5am the hives stopped.  I was not able to sleep through it.  I did not ever have a fever, I checked that 4 times.  I also did not have trouble breathing or have any swelling on my face. 3-15-21 @ 9:20am I went to see my doctor.  All of my vitals were good.  All of my hives were gone.  He put me on Prednisone in case it came back and at 11am I took 4 pills and went to bed.  I woke up 2 hours later and my feet were itching again.  My left foot broke out in hives bad.   It lasted for over an hour.  My toes were hard to bend.   4:34pm on 3-15-21 currently I don&#39;t have any hives and I am tired.    I thoroughly thought through everything that I have eaten, worn, and used, and I have changed nothing over the past 2 weeks.

After no side effects, I drove away.  Only to have a sudden reaction as I was driving.  I&#39;ve felt dizzy with flu vaccines before and have felt the same symptoms as with the covid vaccine when IV dye was injected for a CT scan 5 months ago.  Felt faint/ dizzy, Got severe tachycardia, thought my heart was gonna explode.  I drove back in a hurry, scared and confused. I was waiting to be seen, and no one ever came out.  Symptoms subsided on their own after 15 min, therefore I just left without notifying anyone.  2 hours after vaccine, my arm looked moderately red and swollen, with minimal pain.  7 hours after getting the vaccine I started with chills and body aches.  8 hours after getting the vaccine I felt feverish and malaise.  After taking Tylenol with feverish symptoms (didn&#39;t check temp) slept for 2 hours and felt a little better.

                                                In addition to the known side effects of extreme fatigue, low grade fever and body aches, I also have right arm pain at the site of injection with right arm swelling, warmth and right axilla swelling and tenderness.  The arm pain was began immediately at the time of injection and did initially lessen some for the first 12 hours until it started worsening mid-morning 22-24 hours after the injection.  Around 26 hours after the injection the arm pain worsened such that it couldn&#39;t be ignored and the axilla pain became very prominent almost worse than the arm pain.  Upon inspection I noticed obvious swelling and pain in my right axilla.  The right arm and axilla pain has persisted and worsened over the last 2 days to now include upper biceps, upper triceps, lower deltoid, trapezius, clavicular and right lateral breast pain.  The axilla and arm swelling has persisted and worsened over the last two days to now include swelling in my upper arm, around my clavicle, my upper chest and upper back.  The initial axilla swelling has not decreased any and is more prominent than any of the swelling located elsewhere.  Of note, I cannot easily palpate any axilla, clavicular or cervical lymph nodes.  If there is lymp involvement the nodes are not appearing to be extremely swollen with palpation exam.

                                                Patient had covid19 vaccine yesterday in her left arm. Today, she noted some swelling at the base of her neck on the left and it is quite tender to touch. The upper arm is only mildly tender. The vaccine was Johnson and Johnson. She has no breathing difficulties and no trouble swallowing. No fever, chills or myalgia. No chest pain.   Acute onset. Stable. She has no evidence of airway compromise or difficulty swallowing. This does not appear to be lymphadenopathy. I want her to monitor closely. Apply ice to area as directed on after visit summary. Acetaminophen for pain. If enlarges with any evidence of airway compromise at all, she must go directly to Emergency Department or call 911. I encouraged her to report this on VAERS site for adverse vaccine reaction.  As of 4/11 1:41pm pain at collarbone is same, but swelling is down a bit. Injection site is now very tender/ painful to touch.

The leg pain started on Friday night.  Saturday woke up with a groggy head and tired. Sunday I had leg pain, headache, and foggy brain.  Saturday into Monday I had night sweats (pouring in sweat) fever, headache, body aches, tired (could not keep my eyes open) I slept all day and could barely move comfortably.  Tuesday I was extremely exhausted, leg pain continuing, headache, and weird feeling.  The swollen arm is back.  Today is Wednesday, almost a week after with leg pain, headache, swollen arm, and weird feeling.

Right lower leg and F&amp;A also had minor pitting, but not the pronounced swelling seen in the left.    Did self MLD massage, elevated and wore compression.  Tingling in left leg overnight and felt heavy.   Called doctor&#39;s office as soon as they opened on Day 17 post.  Saw them that afternoon.  Swelling had already gone down significantly either on its own or due to compression, elevation, and massage.   Practitioner noted pitting edema in both ankles, more pronounced in left.  It was not painful or warm, so she ordered a D-dimer test if I still had swelling over the weekend.   Since swelling continued to improve, nothing else was done.

                                                About six hours after the vaccine I had a headache. I woke up during the night with all over body aches that were very painful. I also had a headache and fever of 100-102 degrees. I was in bed for three days and I was still very fatigued for a whole week. My hands and legs were swelling off and on. I also had some shortness of breath, coughing and chest pain. I was dizzy and lightheaded. I have been very uncomfortable and unable to sleep. I still have tingling and pain in my feet. I get easily winded and I am still experiencing headaches. It has been almost three weeks. My feet and hands are still swelling and my hands are very red. I am seeing my doctor today for a breathing treatment. Everything seems to be slowly improving but the headaches are still coming and going. I have a weird feeling of bubbles all over.

The x-ray didn&#39;t show anything however my cbc was of concern and she also did a d timer.  It came back elevated,  so she sent me over for a CAT scan with contrast. It showed pneumonia in my upper and lower right lung and also my lower left lung. She sent me home to try and treat it there. Over the weekend I felt worse and my husband took me to the ER.  Upon arrival my blood pressure was 160 over 120 and heart rate was 140. They admitted me to the hospital for treatment of sepsis and pneumonia and pain management. I was there for 4 days. I was released on the 22nd of April and I am still feeling all of these effects on my body. Headache that I have not been able to get rid of even with the help of  prescription medication.

The allergy meds helped but once they wore off I would start itching. Two days after the shot my face got really puffy especially around the eyes. For six days I took 2 Zyrtec in the morning and 1 benadryl at night. After 6 days of the allergy meds I finally was back to normal.

Anaphylactic Reaction:  sore throat went to very sore strep throat feeling, throat felt like closing, difficult breathing 15 minutes: coughing asthma began. Blood sugar felt it was dropping ( 20 min prior had breakfast sandwich before shot). Right arm hand tremors began, week in legs even when sitting  sever headache.  Asked staff get a Benadryl- call 911. Took 25 mg tab benedryl 5 min prior to EMT arrived.  Same time another woman started difficulty breathing and staff at facility asked if Emt could look at her too. Emt called another ambulance to scene as strap into gurney. Way to ER gave me liquid steroid. ER given epi, nebulizer breathing treatment  Abuterol help breathing, pepicid too.  Discharge after 3:30 pm. 40 mg prednisone ( 2 tabs a day for 4 days) and instructed Benedryl 4-6 hours. Use epi pen if throat and sever sore throat comes back- return to er.

Woke up the a few hours later and went to work and headache came back so I kept taking Motrin until I got off. When I got home I was tired and my headache came back so I went to lay down because I was cold as well. I went to bed and woke up really cold and my husband came in to check on me and I was running a fever of 101.5. My body was hurting really bad as well I took another Motrin and went back to sleep. I woke up the next morning a little weak with a fever blister. I was still sore and has a headache as well. I took some more Motrin all day and the pain went away. I didn?t report to any doctor because I thought this may be normal.

                                                The first two days I had a normal reaction with fatigue and soreness.  On the second night I developed a severe sinus issue that caused my tongue to turn white/gray and be dry and sore.  Frequent diarrhea, headache, sore throat, soreness, low grade fever for half a day and a resulting acid reflux condition. (I have never had acid reflux before) I was tested for Covid and Strep, both negative. Continued lymph node sensitivity for two weeks.  3.5 weeks in, I developed muscle tension, unrelenting, from the back of my head all the way down my spine. I had continued chest pressure and some numbness on my left side in my arm, leg and later my face. No home remedies worked and rarely do I get back/neck/shoulder pain. I was not doing anything strenuous. I went to the ER where they tested me for blood clots (J&amp;J news had just come out and I have a family history) and prescribed valium for the muscle tension which has somewhat helped.   I fully recognize that this might be bad luck, a series of unfortunate events after I received my shot.  However, I have not been sick all year, I have never had acid reflux issues or pain like this in my neck/back/shoulders previously.  The fact that in the 4 weeks after the shot I have not had a single day where I felt normal is a red flag to me. I feel like it is worth reporting in case anyone else has had a similar experience.

                                                As soon as I took the vaccine shot I had an immediate headache, after taking the vaccine I took Tylenol and slept in the rest of the day. The next day I woke up and my arm was red and swollen. I was running fever, still had the headache and now blurry vision. My entire body was hurting. My left side of my body felt numb and tingling. The next two days the pain became worse. I did not really have an appetite. When I did eat I could barely hold my food down. On Wednesday morning I could barely get out of bed, I also felt extreme pain in my lower legs, stabbing pain in stomach and right lower side. I also had ringing in my ears, more in the right ear. I then notice a bruise on my left leg, that it was not originally there, and was also tender to touch. I went to the emergency room on the same day and I was admitted. I was in there for 4 days, they tested my leg and stated it was not a blood clot, although it look and felt like one. They discharge me and advise me that it was a migraine that was causing all my pain.  This was on Sunday, I had a follow up with my PCP on the Friday, however to being in so much pain and shortness of breath, and arm pain I was advise to go to the ER on the Thursday and was admitted again. I was told in the ER I had a blood clot in my right arm and it was most likely from the IV from the previous visit. My blood pressure and heart rate was so high that they put me on medication. No matter the pain medication they gave me, it would not completely take the pain away. They discharge me again on Monday and after me begging them to get run any and all test, they said they found nothing. I&#39;m still in the same amount of pain and same symptoms, still having trouble keeping my food down. The only thing that changed is my left arm is not as sore, however I still have a huge knot and its still warm to touch. I don&#39;t know what else to do that is why im contacting the CDC for help. I&#39;m in a extreme amount of pain and pounding headaches.  Please help

She then started to see slight swelling in the left cheek by 12:00.  She then took 2 Benadryl.  By 12:10 she had tightening of the throat, and by 12:20 she was in the ER at Hospital, and at 12:40 she was seen and they gave her Pepcid at 1:00 PM on top of the Benadryl.  She is currently in observation waiting to see the progress of the reaction.  She is feeling better now, she was not intubated.

                                                I did have leg injury in April - and ever since the vaccine, I  now have an issue with swelling that won&#39;t stop - still have swelling. I was checked with blood clots - and it was elevated so they gave me an ultrasound in leg - no blood clot. Swelling on right leg was enlarged after the vaccine. Two missed menstrual cycles; now I have had the cycle but it&#39;s a longer cycle than I normally would have. It&#39;s abnormal - the length and flow is off. Spotted for a week before I started bleeding. I had slightly elevated blood pressure after the vaccine - 117/83 usual  but it was elevated 141/95 - and it&#39;s never high ever like that before. So they had thought I had a potential blood clot. Have an upcoming doctor&#39;s appt scheduled.

Red rash appeared within 8 hours of injection spreading from injection site over the next 4 days to reach, pink in color, sensitive to touch, measured 10 cm tall by 16 cm in width, remained visible for 10 days and then faded over next 7 days to normal skin color. Burning sensation in shoulders, elbows, knees worse with movement starting 6 hours after injection lasting another 18 hours and then disappeared immediately (24 hours post vaccine). Areas of itching on body starting on back below shoulder blade on left side, spreading to shoulders, arms, waist, torso, neck, face and thighs beginning 24 hours after injection. Red raised blemishes developed over these areas sparsely spaced, raised, hard, itchy, extremely painful when scratched. One on back of arm formed a pustule that was extremely painful if touched. Day 5 visited the doctor about reaction, told to watch and see if symptoms worsened. Symptoms remained the same for the next 5 days and then began to subside. Raised bumps on face, neck, and arms still visible 3 weeks post injection, finally resolving around 4 weeks.

It was found on my left foot plantar region (bottom of my foot). A few days after the vaccine I had swelling on the top and bottom of my left foot. I got two vascular images completed and the MRI was never sent to the vascular department. My podiatrist confirmed the blood clot on an ultrasound. I&#39;m still experiencing swelling.

                                                Day of vaccine, I felt like my lymph nodes were swollen. Two days later the injection site started to get deep red. Friday I started to about an inch of so, swell up some. Saturday I had a rash on my arm by the injection site, the top part on my bicep was pretty red and swollen. I didn&#39;t take my Humara or Zolar injection. On Sunday the rash got worse and grew in size and really hot to touch, the pain was radiating all the way to my wrist and hurt really bad causing pain when I moved my wrist. It was hard for me to go to sleep so I called the dr and went in . The dr. said it looked less red that what it was and told me to take Ibuprofen 800mg* 3x day.  The pain is now in both wrist and hard for to grip stuff and a little hot to touch.  You can see the difference in the skin tone where the rash was, it looks bruised.

                                                Right away I started to feel very hot. I waited the time (15 minutes) they recomemnded to stay at pharmacy. I drove home and started to feel nausea, a light headache, and mildly dizzy. I started to get short of breath about 45 to 50 minutes after the injection. I climbed a flight of stairs and was completely winded I was having trouble catching my breath. My lymph nodes in my neck swelled up a lot and I was developing a sore throat and small bumps on roof of mouth. I called the nurses line and was directed to take a 50 mcg dose of benadryl and that if the shortness got worse to call 911 and use my epi pen.  After about 2.5 hours the breathing seemed to primarily resolve itself and resume more normally. I woke up this morning with a very sore arm, body aches, a mild headache, congested sinuses, and with a sore throat. I do feel like I am not tasting as well as normal, it could be the congestion. I do not feel great but only seem mildly winded and short of breath walking across the house.

                                                I had a headache the next morning but no other symptoms initially.  Then, Saturday evening, just over 24 hours after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine I was sitting in landscape pavers outside in jeans and a long sleeve shirt next to the pool. My husband looked over and said what is wrong with your feet, they are blue. He said that is not good with circulation and you should probably talk to your doctor. Unfortunately I did not take a picture at the time and noted I was a little chilly but would reach out to my doctor if it continued and didn?t think anything more of it until I saw the reports Tuesday morning of them recommending to stop the J&amp;J vaccine.   I called my doctors office Tuesday morning and they asked me to come in over lunch to see the doctor. While sitting waiting to see the doctor my feel replicated the situation from Saturday  night. My toes were especially blue up through my ankle and the doctor pointed out I had red patches looking like a rash. She also noticed my right leg was worse and more swollen up to just below my knee. We did take pictures that we can share if prompted.

                                                8 days after my vaccine, I had to have my appendix removed.  Previous blood work (within a few months prior) showed zero issues.  Also, I never had an allergic reaction to steri-strips or surgical tape and ended up breaking out in a rash from shoulders to mid-thigh.  Finally, I never had cold sores and I had to treat cold sores for 8 days.

The pain eventually subsided but the swollen lymph node is still there to date.  A week after I noticed another swollen lymph node appeared in my neck  and once it became inflammed my face and scalp became very to the touch and my whole mouth got inflammed also.  I went to the PCP who prescribed an antibiotic which did reduce some of the inflammation and pain in my face but the enlarge lymph node on my shoulder is still there.

                                                I had - as soon as she gave me an injection - I felt like it was a little bit hot. I told her that. I knew I had a lot of allergies so I was being careful. Within a minute of sitting down, my right arm became swollen and bright red and felt burning and itchy. And it spread across my chest and went to my left arm. The rash or hives continued up my  neck up to my face and that all happened within first five minutes. Immediately after that, I had excessive coughing - couldn&#39;t cough up anything. I couldn&#39;t catch my breath and my throat started swelling a bit. they gave me 25 mg of Benadryl - capsule over the counter - and the 9-1-1 operator advised not to use the epi- pen. Paramedics came - gave me addition 50 mg of Benadryl - and they took me to the ER across the street and I was administered another 25 mg of Benadryl and also some steroid - Solumedrol - and after receiving these - then these symptoms went away. I continued on Benadryl and prednisone for a few weeks - the very next week - I had a large streak that went from injection site to left chest and I had a second red streak from left chest that ran down to my left arm. For two weeks, that burning fire rash would just come. No rhyme or reason as to when or why - arm, neck, chest, legs and sides. And I&#39;d have to take extra Benadryl every time it would happen and I was still on the high dose of steroids as well. I also had - the next day - 24 -48 hours after vaccine - I had a severe headache and it lasted all day long. And about 24 hours after the vaccine- extreme fatigue, body aches and headache and weakness and that lasted for about three days. Fatigue lasted three to four weeks. Joint aches lasted three to four aches. Headaches have still continued. They have almost been worse actually. I had two headaches that I was so concerned about that would not go away - worst headaches I have ever had: one on May 1 and one on May 9 - and I took Maxalt and some Benadryl - the Benadryl did help a little bit (enough for me to go to sleep). Each headache lasted 12 -15 hours and they were the most severe headaches I had ever had. I didn&#39;t have anyone to take me to take me to hospital so I just tried to sleep. I saw my primary care doctor - virtual visit. I took the prednisone for two to three weeks. I still contend with the headaches.

I stayed for 30 minutes and I could feel a strange feeling of pins and needles seemed to be travelling up my neck and into my face. When I saw that my arm was swollen. My arm started to itch and I was taken into the observation area and checked out. I went home and four hours later I felt like I couldn&#39;t take a deep breath and I started to get a headache, chills and fatigue. The next day my arm  and face were still little numb and I was still having a little trouble breathing. On day four I still felt like I couldn&#39;t take a deep breath and my heart rate was erratic. On the fifth day I went to an Urgent Care clinic. My blood pressure and heartrate were a little high. I went to the doctor the next day because they had found some hardening of my heart. After five weeks I still have a little feeling of pins and needles in my left arm and in the left side of my face.

                                                About two weeks later, I started to get a headache. The pain was massive and it was on one side of my head. I thought I was having a stoke. I took Excedrin and went to sleep and woke up and it was a vain popping out of my head. I had blood clot in my leg.

Diarrhea for 72 hours. 24 hours after the injection the lymph node under my left arm swelled up to about the size of a baseball, it was extremely hot and painful. It stayed that size for 4 days, and then finally started getting a little smaller each day. It&#39;s officially been 10 days and I would say that lymph node is about golf ball sized now. I did see my doctor and she said it can be a normal side effect and as long as it&#39;s going down not to worry. I also was having pain in my back and the doctor suspected a possible pe, my d-dimer test came back positive twice but my platelets remained in the normal range. The second d-dimer was only 513 and considered barely out of range so we assume whatever clot I had dissolved on its own.

                                                Pt called LPHA to report she was seen in the ER on 4/8/21 for a potential blood clot in her left leg. Pt reported she awoke from sleep late 4/7/21 early 4/8/21 with severe pain in her left leg. She reported it hurt so bad she was &#34;screaming&#34;. She stated it felt like a &#34;charley horse&#34; and her husband noted a knot in her leg. She went to the ER on 4/8/21 due to the inability to put pressure on her leg and/or walk on her leg. She reports having a CT scan of her chest at the ER and no clots were noted. She stated they did not image her leg at that time and scheduled an ultrasound/doppler for around 4/27. She was prescribed some oral blood thinner, but could not recall the name. She stated she stopped the blood thinner on 4/12/21 after the new reports regarding the J &amp; J vaccine and not using blood thinners to treat. Today she states her leg is purple, black and blue and is swelling more when she is up on it at work. RN instructed pt to call her primary provider regarding stopping the blood thinner and to see if re-evaluation of her leg is needed. Pt also instructed to seek emergency treatment for increased swelling or pain to her leg, headache, abdominal pain, shortness of breath or any other concerns. Pt plans to speak with or see her primary provider today.

X-rays showed that my lymphatic glands inflamed. I also experienced a cramps from my neck that radiated upwards to the base of my head. My pain was so intense that I took OTC Tylenol to help with my pain. I went again to the ER eight days later because I was having pain to my heart, chest, neck and shoulders and x-rays again demonstrated lymphatic glands inflamed and was told to take Ibuprofen for pain.   To this day I continue to have pain to my shoulders, neck and head but the pain is not as intense as before although the pain is still present daily. I can not work my full 8 hours of work due to my symptoms and can not over-exert myself in performing my daily tasks at work.

Monday, Tuesday - it was chills, fever. 2nd day, my legs started having a sensation I&#39;ve never ever felt - like cramping/charlie horse. I went to work on the third day but I needed to go home. When I came home, my legs were doubled the size. I tried to ride it out by resting. Ever since then, my legs have weird sensations - not cramps but aches. I have never felt this before. Once in a while, when I&#39;m walking, I get cramps. It still hasn&#39;t gone away. At the end of the day, my legs will be swollen but not as bad as the third day after the vaccine.  I think my platelets are actually too high so I think that is a good thing. Upcoming doctor&#39;s appt on July 9 - she is going to do a whole physical with bloodwork.

                                                Systemic Allergic Reaction 20 minutes after injection.  Felt it hit my spine, torso and head felt flush and hives started on torso.  Had I not taken the Allegra D that morning and Famotidine 1 hour before the shot, I would have gotten hives all over my torso and face and swelling would have started in my face.   I had an anaphylactic reaction but the histamine blocker and anti histamine kicked in after about 10-15minutes and I felt better.  Had I not taken the medicine I would have ended up in the Emergency Room.  That night I developed Oral Lichen Planus.  This became extremely bad and uncomfortable for the next 48 hours.  Then it started to heal.  It fully went away after 6-7 days.

                                                I started having an annaphylaxis reaction a short time after i left. At first it was intense all over body itching that felt like it was from the inside out. By the time i got home i was getting red blotchy patches over my face, neck, and chest. I took benedryl which did nothing to subside the reaction. When my chest started feeling tight i went to the emergency room. My lips were itching and puffy. At the er  i received treatment for annaphylaxis once and about a half hour to forty minutes before i was to be discharge i had a reoccurance of symptoms and was treated for it a second time and admitted to the hospital. This was from the March 31st clinic held at the fire department.

                                                My arm was immediately sore and was sore for a week.  Within a few hours from the vaccine being administered I was tired, hands and feet very cold, chills, headache and a fever.   This lasted for 3 days.  I was and am still fatigued and it has been 2 weeks since my vaccine.  On Friday, April 9, 2021  (8 days after vaccine) I woke up with a sore throat and a swollen gland in my neck on the right side (side of my injection).  The sore throat and my swollen gland is starting to subside on Day 14.  Throughout these whole 14 days I have had hot and cold &#34;flashes&#34; and while I already have anxiety my anxiety has been much worse (feeling of a pounding heart) since the vaccine.  It is not my normal anxiety.  On Day 11, Tuesday April 13, 2021 I woke up with a black spot on the right side of my chin closer to my bottom lip.  It does not hurt, not raised and it is just a black spot.  It is still there on Day 14 and slowly starting to fade but not by much.

                                                Around 06:00 pm, which was about 9 hours after having received the J&amp;J vaccine, I began having a slight fever and chills.  The most pain I had was in the back of my legs.  Both of my calves felt as if they had both been kicked and were badly bruised.  It was painful to walk for about 48 hours/2 days (Sunday - Monday).  That was the first time in my life that I had that kind of pain in my back calves.  Never had before from running or walking.  Then around 09:00 pm on Tuesday, a reddish dot appeared on the left side of my cheek.  I thought it was just a big zit.  But the following day, the dot got bigger, and looked like a scratch.  On Wednesday, it was definitely a scratch-like shape (2 lines, less than an inch long) and had begun to feel itchy.  That was when I had realized that it had the same pus-like dotted features of a cold sore.  But oddly, it&#39;s not right next to either side of my lips.  Instead, it is further down, towards the left side of my chin.  It is very rare for me to get cold sores.  I can&#39;t remember when my last one was, as it was years ago.  So I am wondering if this cold sore is due to having received the vaccine.  The fever, chills, and leg pain have not returned after those first 2 days.

                                                About 4 days after the vaccination, I developed a rash, first a large patch on my lower back, followed by other areas, including another large one on my upper left arm (the injection site) and many other smaller ones on my fingers, abdomen, leg, and arms. The rash was initially made up of small clusters of intensely itchy bumps, which would eventually redden and join together. The worst areas also swelled a bit and the skin started to feel dry and began peeling in places.  The rash drove me crazy all day and woke me at night. I treated myself at home with o/c antihistamines, anti-itch creams (hydrocortisone, etc.), and ice packs for a week and a half; but the rash did not subside and was continuing to pop up in new places. I had my appt with the doctor on 04/7/21. Due to my allergy to medrol, I was not prescribed oral steroids. I was prescribed doxepin for pm (sleep and itching), o/c Allegra for am, and a steroid cream. The treatment has been effective and the affected skin is healing.

I called the Nursing Line and they explained that it is common to noticed swelling and pain in the armpit area after receiving the Vaccine and it the pain or selling became worst to make an appointment to see a Doctor.

                                                My injection was on a Monday at 1pm. I had no issues for about a day and a half. On Wednesday afternoon I started having itching and redness on my forearms and top of both hands. Both arms on Wednesday evening were swollen, quite red and sore (a bit of a burning sensation). It almost feels like a bad sunburn at times. I took an antihistamine to help with the itching and swelling and this morning actually put calamine lotion on my arms to help soothe the burning feeling. It is more irritating that painful and nothing needing medical attention but I thought it should be reported.

                                                A bumpy itchy rash started first in my arms and after in wrists and hands so i took 2mg of betamethasone and after 45 minutes another tablet of 1 mg. After 2,5 hours the rash calmed down on the upper part but it started on legs, tighs and foot. I was on fire and to have a bit of relief i put a wet cloth on the skin and i took another tablet of 1 mg of betamethasone and 1 of benadryl allergy. Around 11 pm the rash stopped and the skin became normal. I slept with no problem, but the next morning after 20 minutes I woke up the rash started again in all the body so I took 2 mg of betamethasone and 1 benadryl allergy. I went to the vaccination center but there wasn&#39;t any doctor, only a nurse that told me to keep on taking antisthamine and corticosteroids.  It calmed down around 12 am and started again in the late afternoon.I took a benadryl, i used the wet cloth and around 10 pm stopped. Night with no problem, but around 9.30am the rash started again so i took 1 mg of betamethasone and 1 benadryl. Around 1 pm calmed down and at 2pm i took 2 benadryl. Around 8 pm i had some itchy spot on the legs but it didnt turn out in rash. Today after 30 minutes i woke up i had some spots on the legs, i took a benadryl and after 1 hour disappeared.

The diagnostic were: adverse reaction to vaccine. I already have the syntoms and tomorrow it will be 1 week since I got the vaccine. I don&#39;t know it is normal. If you want I have pictures.

I stayed in bed for a couple of hours. At 5am I got up with all the same symptoms and took my temp which was 101.4. My head hurt like there was too much pressure in my skull. I ate toast and took some ibuprofen and went back to bed. These symptoms lasted for 10 hours. Then for the next 5 hours I just had a fever off and on and fatigue. 3 days after the shot the gland in my left armpit became swollen. It has gone down in size but still sore 5 days later. I still feel tired too.

                                                Later on that evening I started feeling tired, chills, &amp; fever. This lasted about 4 days on the 2nd or 3rd day I had a swollen lymph node under my left armpit. It lasted just a couple of days. On 3/21/2021 I missed my period I did not get it the month of march. Now on the month of April I first started spotting on April 7th it was very light then it went heavy till this day 4/13/2021 I&#39;m still bleeding which is not normal because my period normally only lasts for 4 days. On 3/31/2021 I also had chest pain that lasted for 4 days then it started subsiding. On 3/12/2021 and on 04/11/2021 I got a weird abdominal pain that lasted for less than 5 minutes.

That mostly resolved after 2 days.  Then 1 week later on Saturday, I started having pain in my left leg where I had had RFA of the greater saphenous vein 6 months prior.  Leg swelled up got a hard knot.  I got dizzy &amp; nauseated.  The pain increased, &amp; I went to the ER on 3/21.  They diagnosed it as thrombophlebitis.  The pain &amp; inflammation  has continued  for 3 weeks now despite the use of anti-inflammatory meds &amp; support hose.  I have also had rapid weight gain of 12 lbs and edema not relieved by lasix.  Two weeks after the shot I also started having severe nose bleeds.

                                                The first side effect I noticed was hives on the arm of the injection site as well as the arm being painful. I became light headed and very tired after the first hour of getting the vaccine. As the evening progressed I begin to get chills and a fever. My body ached from head to toe. I was nauseous and achy all over.  I was feeling sick for the next 24 hours, I stayed in bed and could barley move because my body ached so bad. I had a extreme head ache as well.  By the 3rd day I felt much better and only had pain in the arm of the injection site. After day 10 I noticed a lump near my collar bone and assumed based on web searching that it may be a swollen lymph node.  It&#39;s day 12 and I still have a little tenderness near the injection site and my lymph node is still swollen.

                                                3/13 vaccination. 3-4 hours later, I started having symptoms to include tickle in throat, post nasal drip. By 11:40 I had a HA, I was very tired, quite a bit of secretion. I continued taking Benadryl every 3 hours. At 2 :30 PM, heart palpitations and angina. My BP was 98/69. I took more Benadryl, drank some fluids. By 4:15, I was getting drowsy and tired, having pain in multiple joints through my body; 8/10 scale, especially in my hands in feet. I took something for pain. My arm was very sore. I had mild to moderate slight cough. By 7:40 PM I took my regular medication.  I was having a sudden intense HA and pain in joints was 9/10. I was having stiffness, chest congestion, feeling &#39;flu like&#39; symptoms, brain fog, and weird pains / electro shock pains on extremities. By 830, my symptoms increased to almost a really bad allergic reaction. I couldn&#39;t think well, dizzy, cough, chest congestion and my lungs started to hurt. By 10:30pm, I started to have a low grade fever, pain 9/10, I took Ibuprofen and Benadryl every 3 hours.  3/14 Ibuprofen, slight fever, slight HA, joints were swollen and stiff; 8/10 on pain and stiffness. I had muscle pain and brain fog, could not say words. Dull pain back of head. My kidney area, I felt like it hurt, severe anaphylactic reaction it felt like. I still had photophobia. It continued into the evening. I continued taking the Benadryl and ibuprofen. Around 6pm, I had 101.5 temperature, nauseated, crying, chest congestion. By 10:45, my temp was going up again.  Monday I had low grade fever, continued medication. Symptoms continued for a few more days with palpitations, brain fog, pain in lungs and kidneys. I couldn&#39;t do anything. By the end of the week, I started to recover.  *My PCM knew before I got the vaccine they were on board and knew what was going to happen in regards to my reaction, EKG, I had epi pen, didn&#39;t pass out, I decided I was going to stay home.  *It took me a good couple weeks to recover to my baseline. But it was pretty tough.

It happened again a couple of weeks later, and I went to the ER room. The doctors have not found out any correlating event that would make sense yet. I was told to follow up with a cardiologist, I haven&#39;t done this yet. I am not sure if this is from the shot or not.

I tried to drive to the ER but stopped at urgent care since they were closest.  They found that along wit my breathing issues my BP was also running higher than normal.  I was given a steroid to get my breathing and BP under control.  I was released to go home, but told that if symptoms returned that I was to go to the ER immediately.  Given a 5-day prescription for Prednisone to keep future symptoms at bay.  The next few days my face and neck were very swelled, but I was able to breathe.  I was given the vaccination in my left arm, and my fingers have been swollen on my left hand.  The fingernails on my middle, ring, and pinky fingers are also very sore to the touch.

                                                Patient is a 47 y.o. female who is evaluated today for the above concerns.  Patient presents with concerns related to possible reaction to the J&amp;J COVID vaccine she received last week. She developed some face tingling/numbness, then felt like her throat was closing - not sure if due to lymph nodes swelling or possible reaction. She thought about going to ED or using epipen, but ultimately did not need to do either. She has been on zyrtec for her allergies which have been really bad too, so was not sure if that could be contributing. Later that evening she developed headache, chills, joint/muscle pains and fatigue which continued through the night and into the next day. She also had burning of her skin, specifically her hands and feet. She continues to have some fatigue, joint/muscle pains and mild headache. She is worried about recent development of potential clotting with J&amp;J vaccine - she has factor V Leiden and is supposed to travel later this week. Headache not described as severe, no SOB, leg pain or swelling or abdominal pain reported. Tachycardia  &#34;

                                                I felt nauseated right after my J&amp;J vaccine. I also have dry heaviness. I also experienced flu like symptoms. My chin also swelled up really big and I had hard time breathing. I went to the ER due to my throat swelling up and my difficulty to breathe for three days straight and also felt a pressure sensation in my throat and chest.  At the ER they performed lab work, gave me a Toradol injection and also gave me steroids. I also took a homeopathic remedy which was given to me by a friend who is a doctor and my symptoms started to get better.   On another note, my sister also had the J&amp;J vaccine and she also had nausea symptoms but only lasted 3-4 days but I do not know if this is a genetic component.

                                                About 5 minutes after I received the shot, had a sudden burning sensation in the middle of my chest that radiated out. I thought that was it for me. Nausea, dizziness, numbness in my left cheek and arm, got a funny taste in my mouth. This got pretty intense and lasted about 10 minutes. They had me stay in observation for another 45 minutes as those symptoms came in waves but never as intense as the first time. They let me go and I went home to rest. On the way home my cheeks became flushed and it felt like my eyes and cheeks were swelling. I had a lot of other symptoms over the next several hours which I wrote down. Early Tuesday morning those symptoms went away and I was left with some flu like symptoms, dizziness and a brain fog like I have never had before.

                                                I had chills, fatigue, headache, and bilateral calf and thigh muscle pain that started about 6 hours after the vaccination and lasted about 36-48 hours. I took Tylenol 500mg after the onset of symptoms and three times a day. The symptoms went away by mid-day on 4/13/2021. Since then, I have been experiencing bilateral calf muscle pain off and on. I also had an enlarged axillary lymph node n the left side (side of vaccination). I reported it to urgent care on 4/18/2021 and was told the muscle pain was unlikely to be a clot since it was bilateral and there was no swelling or discoloration. I was told to hydrate and follow up with my primary care provider if it continues.  The calf muscle pain has continued - almost every other day - and responds to Advil. I have an appointment to talk to an MD tomorrow (May 5th)

It felt like my bones were made out of glass and someone had taken a hammer to my bones.  My face was swollen and red.  Unable to sit up.  Walk from bed to toilet only.  Overall, I would say extreme flu-like symptoms.  Temperature 99.6 all day.   I could not take the pain any further at 4:20 pm and took 1,000 mg of Tylenol.  I finally fell asleep and woke up at 8:30pm and could walk again and my fever had broken.  I still don&#39;t feel great, but I think the worst is behind me.

                                                Immediately broke out in a sweat and was very hot.  Didn&#39;t think much about it.  The staff noticed I was in some distress and kept asking if I was okay to which I replied I thought I&#39;d be fine once I got some fresh air.  Left the facility to drive home and didn&#39;t feel right, Within 30 minutes, developed chest pains, rash and labored breathing.  I recognize the symptoms as the same symptoms I get when I&#39;ve had morphine, which I now must list as an allergy.  This lasted 4 hours, then got better.  The next day around 1:00, I became ill again with flu-like symptoms and had to leave work.  Headache and body aches mostly.  I was ill with these symptoms for a 24 hour period.  Hopefully all symptoms have passed, except my arm which is red, swollen, itchy and feverish.

The next day, sysmptoms worsened, with a fever of 101, and increased pain in my arm. It is now April 9, 2021 and my fever is gone but my arm feel numb and I have swelling in my arm pit by lymph nodes and painful to touch. I feel like my vaccine arm is not as responsive and slow. I feel tired, short of breath when I walk which keep me from my usual workout routine.  I work out three times a week and before the vaccine, considered myself to be in very good health. I did have Covid 12/31/20 and my symptoms were far more mild than what I experienced taking this vaccine.

The next morning, I felt extreme fatigue. I was in bed all day. About 27 hrs after vaccine (approx 6pm), I had chills. Took temp was 99.7 (my temp is always 97.6-as a baseline). Took 2 Tylenol. Took temp 30 min later was 100.6. Laid in body with 4 blankets trying to get warm. Temp lasted until Tylenol kicked in. Next day, (2 days after vaccine), left armpit lymph node sore/swollen.

                                                Twelve days after the vaccine I got a severe headache with blurry vision. I was also short of breath and my legs were swollen. I was dizzy and had body aches mostly on my left side. My left kidney was inflamed. The pain went all the way on the left side of my body from my ribs to my legs. My left leg was the most swollen. Many of the symptoms lasted for two and a half weeks. The headache lasted for three days. The first week was the worst. When I went to the ER  after a week they did not find any blood clots. The aches pains and swelling in my legs came and went over the course of three weeks. I was very tired when the symptoms were present.

I called the doctor and the headache went away. A few days later, my fingers and toes started tingling like electricity was flowing through them, with numbness. The circulation in my legs slowed down and ached really badly. I received comfort by forcing myself to walk to increase the circulation of my legs. This lasted for two weeks and was so bad that I almost went to the ER. The glands of my neck and the lymph nodes under my arms are still swollen and sore.

By the second or third day post-vaccine I developed hives on the back of my neck and shoulders and cold sores on my mouth and nose and continued to have a headache.  I was seen by my doctor on March 12th and was told that I had a sinus infection.  I was prescribed 100 mg Doxycycline Hyclate and began seeing improvements within 36 hours to the sinus infection.  The hives are still clearing up and were not treated.

Then on Friday 4/16/21 started having coughing, which gradually got worse to where she was having difficulty breathing when she talked which caused more coughing, and feeling like her throat was closing.  She called her doctor and is waiting on a call back to go see him, but did go through a Pharmacy drive through to see if she had COVID, and if she&#39;s clear she will see her doctor when they call her back.

When I woke up at 10:30 am Saturday my face was extremely swollen.  My left side seemed to be more swollen then my right side.  Called Dr. on Monday &amp; decided to wait a few days.  Also started to have diarrhea as well on Monday.  The swelling was better by Friday.  Also found that I was having trouble sleeping even though I was feeling extremely tired.  That Thursday I had an extreme burning in my stomach. Only way I can describe it is that it felt like there were flames in my stomach. The burning was so bad that it was making me extremely nauseous.  Friday the burning was better but the burning is still coming &amp;going but no where near as bad as the first time.  Please note that I stopped all vitamins &amp; supplements after I received the shot on Friday.  Im only still taking my adder all.

                                                About 12 hours after I received the Johnson-Covid vaccine I had moderate to severe flu like symptoms.  The symptoms  lasted in their intensity and severity for aproximatly 13 days. I was pretty much bed ridden. My symptoms were: moderate to severe chills and body aches, EXTREME fatigue, Lymphnodes swollen in neck, the lymp in the right side of neck is still VERY sore (oddly, the oposide side of where I recieved the vaccine).  Today is the 14th day, and the symptoms have finally decreased. I thought I should let you know.  I did contact my doctor twice to inform her. She suggested rest and lots of liquids.

Routine blood tests showed nothing unusual (lymphoma). Was sent home to see my doctor if the swelling doesn&#39;t subside.  Scheduled an appointment with my PCM on 23 Apr 2021 (virtual - they are not seeing in-person patients yet). By this point, the swelling had not subsided and there was new pain in my left elbow shooting dow nto my hand.  The doctor prescribed Naprosyn, lidocaine patches, and a wrist brace to keep the nerves stable. Was told it was &#34;pain management&#34; until the swelling from the lymph nodes go down. It is now 6 weeks post-vaccine and the pain and swelling is still the same. I have been unable to secure an appointment with my PCM. For the past 6 weeks, my pain level has been at a steady 8 out 10.

It spread to my esophageal tube (extremely tender), a couple hours later my throat became strep-like sore, could not take a full breath, and throat swelling impacted my ability to talk clearly.  About 12 hours later, I had facial swelling.  One full day later, a chain-like rash appeared on my arms, chest, thighs, and feet.  Each subsequent day is spread to a new body part (but never occurred on my face),  I had to take Benadryl EVERY 4-5 hours to keep everything at bay.  Three days into the event my neck and torso skin were extremely painful to touch.  Most days since, I am exhausted and get winded easily.  Today is 30MAR21 and it&#39;s happening again as it began on 21MAR21.  I took two Benadryl in the hopes I will not have to go to ER again.

I had fever, headache and body aches that started 24 hours after and they lasted about 36 hours. OTC cold and pain medication was taken for those. I had significant swelling under my left arm in the armpit. That lasted for about a week. At the same time as the fever, headache and body aches started, I had swelling under the eyes that started in the upper eyelids for about a week and that went down to the lower lids about a week post vaccination and since then it has been upper and lower eyelids - significant swelling and on March 30th  (started me on the Prednisone on this date)  - it initially helped and then it went back to worse than it was before. and on April 7th  Benadryl and Neomycin- a topical steroid I&#39;ve been applying under the eyes for that.  The swelling was significant until this last Wednesday when I got on these two meds. Today I had a phone call visit with my doctor as a follow up to how the meds were doing. Recovery is progressing at this time.

I felt my throat constricting a bit.  The rash itchiness is still ongoing.

                                                Monday night had very bad sweats/chills and was tired/sore as expected. Tuesday my lymph node glands in my throat on the side where I got the vaccine swelled nearly three times their size. I felt flu-like symptoms: fever, exhaustion, weakness, body aches and a headache. Wednesday I felt the same and nauseous in the evening. I had iced my lymph nodes and that helped a little with the soreness. (Took IB off/on since Monday as I thought I had a low fever and was achey/headachey). Thursday, I noticed that the soreness/pain in my lymph nodes moved up my jaw and to my ear (on the side where I got the vaccine). I still felt weak and tired. I tried to work at 11:15a and felt my brain couldn&#39;t quite think straight. Today (Fri.), pain in jaw/side of head and headache continue. Think the swollen glands are making it hurt when I swallow. Felt a little something in my leg; but would not say it was painful. NO abdominal pain or trouble breathing.

                                                Within 5 minutes of the shot, I started to have difficulty swallowing. I notified the staff at the clinic, They put me in a separate room where I took 50mg Benadryl. I continued having difficulty swallowing along with tingling in tongue and lips. I then decided to give myself an Epipen 0.3mg shot. I had this with me because I had a severe allergic reaction in January to Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. 911 was called. In the ambulance, IV Benadryl and Solu-Medrol was administered. My face was starting to itch on the way to hospital even after IV medication administered.  I was monitored for 2 hours in hospital. I was also given normal saline IV in the hospital. I was discharged with Pepcid 20mg daily for 4 days and Prednisone 50mg daily for 3 days. I consistently had to take Benadryl 50mg for three days to keep itching and swelling at bay.

                                                About a week after the vaccine I noticed a lymph node was swollen underneath my right  pectoral muscle. My chiropractor pointed it out that it was visible. One at the base of my skull one on my right pectoral muscle and in both arm pits. The one on my occipital region is the most painful. The one on the left side are still swollen after four weeks. The one in my arm pit was painful with palpating it.  They have seemed ot reduce in size but they are still swollen.

                                                On the 4th day following the vaccine I woke up with swelling in my left armpit about the size of a golf ball.  Achiness on the left side of my face, neck and shoulders that lasted till the 8th day.   By the 14th day, the swelling in my left armpit had shrunk to the size of a large acorn with an enlarged vein like tissue protruding down my inner armpit.  This area was still sore.  On Day 21st I saw a doctor who suspected a blood clot and ordered an ultrasound at the hospital and blood work.  After an ultrasound for approximately an hour the technical did not detect a blood clot and sent me home. The doctor phoned me to tell me they did not find anything and that if the pain and swelling continues I could see a surgeon to have the enlarged area surgically removed.

Rotating between Tylenol and Ibuprofen (started on Tues). I went to my PCM. BP 130/98. Prescribed water pill but only to take on Friday if symptoms got worse, not better.  4/15 Sick all day. By 5pm, I couldn&#39;t even focus, my legs were so swollen, my &#39;head was ready to explode&#39; and I  &#39;didn&#39;t feel right. I went to urgent care; 160/98 BP and referred to the ER. I went to the ER, BP was still elevated, legs still swollen. Checked my heart, ultra sound on my legs and x-ray. I was kind of &#39;out of it&#39;. They did everything to check for blood clots and heart; everything came back clear. They gave me some medicine for my head thru IV. I still left with HA but didn&#39;t feel as bad. That helped my BP went down. I was at the ER 2-3 hours, drinking lots of water. The next day the swelling started to go down on the legs and migraine was subsided. By Sat., I felt fine.

                                                8 hr post vaccine, typical side fx (fever, headache), but also significant bi-lateral leg cramping and spasms that continued for 6-8 hours.  Spasms were prominent in inner thigh/groin and down entire legs.  Legs were not movable (heavy), difficult to get out of bed or walk.  Very strange and nothing like this ever experienced before shot. Fine next day.  Around 4/9, pain began in ball of R foot in the AM, hard to walk.  Over next few days, pain extended up to medial posterior calf (very painful), back of knee and groin.  Unexplained bruising on lateral calf.  4/20 woke to swelling of R leg (ankle, posterior knee, groin), went to Urgent Care that night and was sent directly to ER for DVT symptoms.   ER Ultrasound showed no clot, was sent home.  Pain continued to increase, with burning and difficulty walking.  Second Ultrasound done 4/22.  No clots found.  Pain continued to worsen, with swelling/aching on front of calf and severe foot pain.  Veins/skin tender.  Painful groin spasms happen again, same as night of shot.  PCP ordered ABI and spine Xray.  ABI was normal.  Xray showed same issue as 29 yrs ago (prior known L5S1 anterolisthesis; have not had back pain for many years...when I did, it was localised to spine and sciatic in the L hip, was not at all similar to these current issues in R leg.  perhaps related if inflammed, but is vastly different in symptoms and unlike past history).  Saw Vascular Surgeon 4/30, ordered abdominal CT Abdomen Pelvis w IV Contrast.  results normal. arm bruising at IV and blood draw site.  Saw second Vascular Surgeon 5/4 who felt pain related to inflammation response and ordered CBC.  Platelets 178. (patient had requested this test starting on 4/20, this was the first doctor to order it).  Pain continued but some relief found with compression socks.  on 5/10 US Bilateral lower extremity venous duplex with reflux study was done on both legs.  No DVTs, but damaged valves and reflux in the external iliac common femoral vein and femoral veins proximal segment (worse in R leg)  and great saphenous vein at the sapheno-femoral junction (R only).  These areas are where the spasms are happening but doctor not able to conclude relation, wants neuro consult, could be nerves causing spasms. Doctor prescribed compression socks for venous insufficiency concerns, to be rescanned annually for life. Vascular test results don&#39;t explain severe pain in calf and foot and referred to Neurologist for 5/28 visit.  As of today, 5/22, pain is persistent.  Pain/swelling is reduced with use of compression socks but returns without them; walking is difficult in the AM and PM hours; night time spasms.  Have also had shooting pains in L calf, both forearms, and ribs (back).  These occur mostly in the evening (nerve?).  Taking magnesium &amp; extra vitamin D seems to help some. On strict anti-inflammatory diet.  I&#39;d really like some guidance for treatment and what to do about boosters - do I switch to an mRNA vaccine?  I am a very healthy active 49 yr old woman who felt fine before the shot, and now I&#39;ve been in a lot of pain, working greatly reduced hours for almost 4 weeks.  Please advise on what can be done to help.  Concerned about permanent damage and how to handle future vaccines.  (also of note:  first menstruation period was skipped after the shot, second period came a week late and was very heavy with bright red blood.  I am normally extremely regular, mod-heavy flow;  also, the J&amp;J shot I had was a &#34;last shot of the day&#34; extra dose.  I was offered it while having a routine physical.  Could it have been improperly stored, as the last leftover dose?  Very unlikely since it was a doctors office, but including this info)

They ran fluids on her and at the end of the day they said she was okay to go home.  The next day the fever started again and he ended up calling an ambulance to take her to the hospital.  She went to Hospital on 3/16, who took her to another Hospital.  They sent her home about 4 days later and said that her symptoms were from the vaccine.   He called and he filed a report with them.

                                                The night of my injection I woke up with extreme left arm and scapular pain.  It radiated down to my fingers.  It all was heavy and number and tingling.  That continued most of the day.  The next day I was extremely fatigued and weak and stayed in bed.  I think had left ear and lymph node pain on the left side of my face and neck.  This continued for days.  By the 1 week mark after my injection, I ended up at the urgent care with facial swelling and extreme lymph node pain.  They stated it was an adverse reaction to the vaccine.  As of yesterday, I continue to have some swelling in my jaw and occipital region as noted by the PTA where I go for physical therapy.  I continue to experience extreme fatigue, worse than normal and dizziness.  My left pinky still has some tingling and vibration feeling.  I also still get cramping on this finger and on the ulnar side of my palm.

By 11:00 PM pt. felt faint and nauseated and left leg was swollen and discolored. Rescue squad was called and took pt. to Hosp where she was told it was sciaticia. After showing the medical professionals her leg and insisting upon an ultrasound of her leg she was told the &#34;machine&#34; was not available and she would be called the next day to be scheduled. Per pt&#39;s daughter, she was never called and daughter called hospital to have U/S scheduled. Pt. went back to hospital on 4/14 at 3:15 PM for U/S and she was diagnosed with multi DVT&#39;s in left leg which at that time had swelling all the way down to her foot. Pt. was put on Coumadin.

I had vague abdominal pain which intensified in the last week. I am four weeks out from vaccination and I get acute gastric pain after I eat with diarrhea. The pain is from my midline to upper right quadrant pain that radiates out. It is a constant pain at a 3-4 intensity level which intensifies to a 9-10 for a few hours after I eat. I have been trying to treat with heat. I try not to eat too often but it is difficult. I have had to visit the ER and the doctor because of the acute GI pain. There was imaging and IV fluids and labs in the ER yesterday. The CT scan did not indicate anything but I have scheduled an endoscopy to check up higher in my GI tract.

                                                Patient&#39;s husband called about reactions after the vaccine as patient does not speak english. She experiencing trouble breathing for the whole week and feels very tired. Also reports swelling and pain in the legs and hand, significant enough to prevent her from removing her wedding ring. I recommended them to go to the emergency room as soon as possible as her symtoms resemble a possible clot. She does not have a PCP to refer her to nor does she has insurance. He agrees to take her to the emergency room.

                                                I had 2 adverse reactions to the Janssen Covid-19 Vaccine EUA: AE #1) Roughly 15 minutes after receiving the vaccination, the lower half of my face went numb for approximately 3 hours. The people who administered the vaccine made me stay at the site for about an hour and a half to make sure that the reaction did not get worse. AE #2) 10 days after receiving the vaccination, the lower part of my left leg began to swell significantly. I went to the emergency room on 4/13/2021. When I was there, they did tests and confirmed that I have a blood clot behind my knee. To treat the blood clot, the emergency room doctor gave me lovenox 110mg and warfarin 5mg. Since then, I have followed up with my primary doctor who has me taking warfarin 10mg ( 1x daily) and lovenox (as needed).

                                                Hello, I received the J&amp;J vaccine on 3/12/2021. Eight days later on the 20th when I went to bed I had a lot of pain in my left heel and left thumb.   The next day, on a Sunday, the pain was now in my left heel, left thumb at the big knuckle and top and bottom below my thumb, and just behind the inside of my left ankle, and I had a terrible headache.   I was unable to grasp anything or widen my grip because the pain was so intense in my thumb.  It was so bad I went to my local ER who did xrays and told me it was just osteoarthritis.   The next day,  Monday, the pain was terrible. It was in my left thumb, the middle of my left hand, left ankle, the arch of my left foot top and bottom, the big knuckle at the bottom of my left big toe, my right hand was also now hurting at my middle finger the big knuckle at the bottom. I went to see my family doctor who really was unsure at the time what was going on and said it&#39;s still just must be the osteoarthritis. The next day on Tuesday I still have the headache I was out unable to open my own water bottles or prescription bottles because the pain was so intense in my left hand. It was now extremely painful to walk on my left foot and I had no appetite. The following day on Wednesday the pain was bad and my right hand that I was unable to touch my ring finger or my pinky with my thumb. As hard as I try my thumb just would not reach those two fingers oh. I now couldn&#39;t open any of the doors in my house unless I use the base of my Palms on both hands turn the knob. I now couldn&#39;t even comb my own hair or pull my pants up wipe myself properly. I couldn&#39;t hold a pencil or anything because the pain was so unbearable. I had no appetite and now I have diarrhea. I called my husband at work and had him come home and we went to the emergency room because it was a bigger facility. The doctor there told me he thought it was something more like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. This was by far my worst d ay even though I was unable to work this entire week. Oh and did I mention the only reason I got that back who was because my boss with bullying me and pressuring me every day to get the vaccine. He even went so far as to come of my office and he wanted to use my keyboard to schedule my vaccine himself. The next day on Thursday I was still having a hard time walking I still couldn&#39;t touch my ring finger on my pinky with my right hand still unable to open anything with either one of my hands. My husband had to open all the water bottles and prescription bottles and just set the caps on them before he went to work.  I now had flashing light in my eyes which lasted about a week. The following day I had all the same symptoms but now my left foot was so swollen I couldn&#39;t even get a shoe on it. The big knuckle at the base of my right hand hurts so bad at this point and so does the big knuckle at the base of my left thumb. The swelling and the pain is just unbearable at this point. The following day on Saturday my mom had come up from Florida and stay with me for two weeks take care of me someday the next day on March 28th I start all the same symptoms but now my muscles were quivering on the back of both thighs. By the middle of next week I still had all of the same pain and now I&#39;m realizing that I can&#39;t span open my fingers on my right hand and I&#39;m unable to snap my fingers. Side note as of today I still cannot snap my fingers on my right hand. At this point I have been keeping a diary every day of where my pain was in what the pain level was each day. So strange that it&#39;s affecting joints on both sides but just in my hands the inside of my wrist and my left foot. Are April 28th I finally got into the rheumatologist. He had me go to the hospital and get blood work done and x-rays. On Thursday May 6th I was unable to go to work. It seems like I can go to work about 3 days a week and the pain is so intense that I&#39;m missing about two days a week. Dr called me and said all of my tests came negative for rheumatoid arthritis.He told me not just because I was a patient but if I was his own sister he would suggest going to the Clinic right away. He said they have a larger database and if anybody else was having the same reaction to the covid vaccine they would know about it. My husband came home from work and made the four-hour drive to the Clinic. I was there Thursday and Friday they the blood work a sonogram x-rays the whole gamut of tests. The rheumatologist in the ER said that he thinks it&#39;s still something like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus but that was in the early stages and not showing up positive on the test. On Friday I met with dr. a rheumatologist oh, and the chairman at the Clinic. They said this is a very rare reaction to the J&amp;J vaccine and they&#39;re hopeful by prescribing me a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and Voltaren gel that hopefully I will have some relief within a week and they were hopeful that the symptoms will go away within 3 months. They also took me off work for the next week. Did I mention got the first month that was going on they have me on 50 mg of Prednisone for one week then 100 mg of Prednisone for 2 weeks and then back down to 50 mg for one week. After being on that high dosage of Prednisone for an entire month I still have all of the swelling and pain in my joints. My joints are very stiff at this point. The prednisone maybe eased the pain just a touch but the pain and swelling was definitely there, and the pain is excruciating. I&#39;m feeling so alone, and scared because I don&#39;t know anybody else that&#39;s having the same reaction. I&#39;m also fearful I&#39;m going to lose my job I&#39;m missing so much work. But I also feel like my boss pressured me into this and now I&#39;m suffering. If anybody is having the same reactions to Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine please reach out to me. I have my vaccination card I can show you and I have a ton of doctor and  hospital records to verify my story. I&#39;m really worried because I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on with me, how long it&#39;s going to last, and is it going to come back if I do get these symptoms to go away.  My work place offers no paid extended leave, and has repeatedly asked me I&#39;d I was quitting my job.   I&#39;m only having these problems because I was pressured and bullied into getting this vaccine. I completely blame my boss. I would have never got vaccinated if he wasn&#39;t on me about it every single day repeatedly. I&#39;m at a loss as to what to do from here. I have no income coming in. Do I qualify for unemployment or some sort of disability benefits? If anybody can please give me some suggestions I&#39;m open to whatever you have to say

The patient&#39;s weight, height, and medical history were not reported. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, and batch number: 1805029 expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total administered to left deltoid on 14-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. The patient received Benadryl unspecified (form of admin and route of admin were not reported, batch number: unknown expiry: unknown) dose and frequency were not reported from MAR-2021 for itchy rash. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 14-MAR-2021, after eight hours of vaccination, the patient woke up with intense muscle cramping which she had anticipated but also had joint cramp. The patient had temperature of 103.5 (unit unspecified) and the patient&#39;s right side of face was itching down into under her ears which also started to swell. The patient had a rash on her legs, arms, face and everything was itchy for her. The patient took a diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and then she had headache, dizziness, ringing in the right ear, nausea, and her fever jumped to 104. The patient laid down her head into floor because the dizziness was so bad and she ended up in more muscle cramping. The patient&#39;s fever never went away but went down and did not go for about a week and three days; the fever was just hanging out at 100 (unit unspecified) the whole time. The patient&#39;s dizziness and ringing was going on and also had GI (gastrointestinal) problems and really bad headache. The patient called a healthcare company and ordered meclizine (Meclizine) but did not specified she administered it or not. On 26-MAR-2021, the patient could not take the stomach pain, cramping, diarrhea, high fever, rectal bleeding and mucusy and bloody stool. The patient had intense abdominal pain and GI (gastrointestinal) issues after three days of her fever and was taken to ER (emergency room) and was confirmed that the patient had renal insufficiency and medication induced colitis. The patient had colitis and was given with metronidazole (Flagyl), however she had low grade fever, dizziness, ringing in ears, really bad headache and was admitted to hospital on 28-MAR-2021. The patient&#39;s CRP (C-reactive protein) was up, lactic acid was elevated, hemoglobin went from 14 down to 12, WBC count elevated, occult blood was positive and also had rectal bleeding, a foggy headache and dizziness feeling. The patient felt something was way off in her body at the side, also had a small orange halo on arm at the injection site which got resolved after four days. The patient had undergone unspecified tests and the results was negative. The patient liver enzymes were too off which was hand in hand with medication induced colitis. The patient had a small internal hemorrhoid and removed a polyp. The patient&#39;s heart rate experienced some issues as well. The patient was hospitalized for 6 days. The patient was discharged on 02-APR-2021.The patient had a follow-up with her physician on the next day of this report. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable; and action taken with Benadryl unspecified was not reported. The patient recovered from had polyp on MAR-2021, generalized itchy rash on 16-MAR-2021, muscle tenderness on 06-APR-2021, and redness at injection site on 18-MAR-2021, was recovering from ringing in the right ear, rectal bleeding, medication induced colitis, joint tightness, lump at injection site, bloating, swelling at injection site, and small internal hemorrhoid, had not recovered from fever, headache, and dizziness, and the outcome of intense muscle/joint cramping, nausea, unable to eat or drink and renal insufficiency was not reported.

The doctor did a vein ulta sound didn&#39;t find anything. The doctor laughed at me like I was crazy. I have high pain tolerance and I was in extreme pain. And the doctor did not take me seriously. I followed up with the physician the next day. and asked her to report it, but as far as I know she didn&#39;t report it. I just started feeling better, May 20 th, from april 6. for me to start feeling normal again.

                                                3/15/21: Within a few hours of the vaccine, I felt fatigued, followed by chills, severe body aches, fever, and dehydration (in that order). Improved by Day 5. 4/5/21:  Lump on left thigh appeared. Raised up, hard, red, and warm.  Went to  Clinic  ER immediately. Ultrasound of area and blood work showed no obvious abnormalities. Symptoms were diagnosed as &#34;insect bite&#34;. Lump became painful several hours later. Antibiotics, Benadryl, and Corticortisone prescribed for 10 days. Took medication as instructed. Improvement by Day 7. Lump shrunk but did not completely resolve. Swelling and pain gone.  Completed medication on 4/15/21. 4/22/21:  Lump returned on left thigh, quickly turning into a large, solid mass. Red, warm, more swollen than the first time, and more tender to the touch and painful.  4/23/21:  Went to Walk-In Clinic , Nurse Practitioner ordered MRI and more blood work. 4/25/21:  Lump appeared on right thigh, same characteristics as the left thigh, also quickly turning into a large mass. Very painful. Hip size increased from 40 to 42 inches within a few days from the swelling.  Unable to wear underwear due to how excruciatingly painful the area(s) were.  Painful to sit, painful to stand up, painful to remain standing. Sharp shooting pains. Legs would feel as though they would give in if I stayed standing up too long. 4/28/21: Returned to Walk-In Clinic due to unbearable pain and nightly fevers. Antibiotics were prescribed on this visit, and a referral to a general surgeon and a Hematologist were made by the Nurse Practitioner who tended to me, . 5/3/21:  Went to see Orthopedic Surgeon Dr. . He reviewed the MRI with me and showed me the areas where fluid was all over in the area affected (thigh). Referred me to Dr. , Rheumatologist. 5/4/21:  Dr.  examined both thighs and determined a biopsy under general anesthesia was needed in order to do deep tissue removal. He also ordered more blood work.  5/4/21:  Initiated surgery preparations: Lab work, COVID testing, EKG, Chest X-Ray, Visit with General Practitioner to be cleared for the surgical procedure, Visit with surgery department.  5/6/21:  Surgical biopsy under general anesthesia performed. 5/13/21: Visit with Dr.  to remove surgical gauze, and examine the area.  5/14/21:  Visit with Dr.  for pathology / biopsy results.  I was informed that inflammation levels in my body were at 45%, where they should normally be at 8%.  Pathology concluded that an external cause was to blame for the inflammation, further stating that it was a foreign substance consistent with silicone injected in the area.  It is noted that I have no silicone implants in any part of my lower body. Nor have I had any silicone injected in my thighs. 5/17/21:  While using a pair of scissors and exercising normal pressure to cut a paper tag from new clothing, the area below my right thumb suddenly became swollen, purplish, and extremely tender. After two hours of no improvement, went to  Health where they took an X-ray and determined it was a Sprain.  I did not exercise any force to justify a sprain in that region. I was prescribed cortisone for 6 days. 5/20/21:  Follow up visit with Dr. , Rheumatologist, for second opinion on pathology results. Dr.  ordered blood work done in-office, as well as ordered additional blood work to be done at the lab.  Results pending. After also examining all of my blood work done up until that point, she deduced that the issue with my hand was also likely caused by inflammation in my body,  and whatever is causing the swelling in my thighs. The area of the hand turned black and blue the likes of severe trauma, yet there was no blunt force to the area. At the time of this reporting, I continue on blood thinner and anti-inflammatory medication for another 10 days to complete the 30 days post surgery. Additional blood work has been ordered to measure the inflammation levels and proceed accordingly.  Currently I feel throbbing in my legs mostly at night when I lie down. Prior to the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine, I had no medical issues. My only visits were routine control visits annually. I do not drink or smoke; and exercise regularly (until this happened).

                                                After the vaccination, I felt a little dizzy waiting in the parking lot and had a sore arm, but felt fine otherwise.  (12:00-1:00 pm)  After returning home, I felt increasingly tired and warm.  I laid down  and took my temperature after walking the dog around 3:00 pm.  My temperature read 99 degrees.   I drank a lot of pedialyte to hydrate.  Throughout the afternoon, I felt sluggish and the glands seemed to swell up on the side of my neck. I also got a headache.   My temperature dropped down to 98.7 before I went to bed, but this morning, my glands under my jawline are a bit more swollen and I still have a slight temperature; 98.9 degrees.  My eyelids are puffy and I feel a little feverish, but it is tolerable.

Pt alert and oriented at this time.  Speaking in full sentence, drinking bottled water without any difficulty. No drooling noted.  Denies SOB, chills or fever.   Emergency Department Attending Attestation Note   See resident/PA/student note for further details of HPI, history, exam, ED course, and diagnoses.   Briefly, this is a 51 y.o. female with PMH reviewed in chart and w/ patient notable for insulin dependent diabetes, depression, prothrombin mutation, migraine, p/w concern for allergic reaction.  Emesis or change in Covid vaccine today.  10 minutes after receiving the vaccine, patient reports feeling thick in her tongue with tingling in her lips.  Patient was given Zertec.  The minutes later, her lips began to swell up and was also noted to have new erythematous rash between her eyes and forehead.  Patient was given 50 mg of Benadryl.  Patient felt like she could not swallow with worsening lip swelling.  She was given EpiPen and 911 was called. No stridors.  No wheezing.  Reports continued tingling and the numbness in her mouth but no lip swelling or tongue swelling.  Denies any difficulty swallowing at this time.  No wheezing.  No abdominal pain or nausea.  No rash at this time.   Of note, patient also notes left-sided facial, arm, and leg numbness starting about 10 minutes prior to arrival to the emergency department.  She reports that she has had recurrent numbness on the left side in the past, which was thought to be due to migraine versus TIA.  She has had extensive work-up and multiple hospitalization for this symptom.  She reports that she is allergic to iodine and gadolinium containing contrast.  Denies any headache at this time though she had a mild headache after receiving the vaccine.  Denies any blurry vision.  Denies any weakness in her bilateral upper and lower extremities.  Assessment and Plan:    Vital signs notable for O2 sat of 96 to 98% on room air without tachypnea.  Patient is mildly hypertensive.  Patient is well-appearing speaking full sentences without any dysarthria.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Extraocular movement intact.  She notes diminished sensation to her left face, left upper extremity, and left lower extremity.  Tongue is midline.  Hearing is intact bilaterally.  No facial droop.  She has 5 out of 5 strength in bilateral upper and lower extremities.  No pronator drift.  Normal gait.  No tongue swelling or lip swelling.  No stridors.  No uvula swelling.  No pharyngeal or erythema.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezing or rhonchi.  Cardiac exam without murmurs rubs or gallops.  Regular rhythm.  No abdominal distention or tenderness on palpation.  No CVA tenderness.   51-year-old female who is presenting to the emergency department with improving lip swelling and numbness in her mouth, raising a concern for anaphylaxis related to her Covid vaccine.  Reassuringly, status post EpiPen, her symptoms are improving.  However, she has new onset left-sided numbness, with without any headache.  She reports that she has had this numbness in the past the last time she had the numbness on the left side was approximately 10 years ago.  Her neurologic exam is only notable for diffuse numbness on her left side including her face.  Differential diagnosis include migraine headache and TIA.  Stroke is possible though less likely given the patient has had the same symptoms in the past with negative work-up.  Will defer code stroke at this time but will emergently consult neurology.  Will get labs including BMP and CBC.  We will continue to monitor her from the anaphylaxis perspective.  We will also give her a dose of steroid.  Prednisone 60 mg by mouth given 12:29 PM  NEUROLOGY CONSULT NOTE  Assessment: Formulation- Diagnosis is guarded. Localization structurally would suggest subcortical (thalamic) or small brain-stem in a sensory territory on the right. Etiologies could be stroke given her vascular risk factors but seems unlikely given there is stereotypy of earlier symptomatology. Demyelinating would be another possibility as well, but again, the stereotype. Seizure unlikely because of the timing of rush from toes to body was minutes and duration of some occasions being days. Complicated migraine possible, has some risk factors, but should be treated as dx of exclusion. She does make complaint of headache, which could support. Some FND elaboration on her anxiety-ridden allergic reaction is also possible, but no objective non-structural signs to support.

                                                The day of the vaccine not much trouble, the injection site was a little sore. As the evening came I started feeling the body aches, the chills. The next morning  I had a headache, I had joint pains (elbow, knee and hip). My arm pain was really severe. I could not even sleep on that side of my arm, the pain was excruciating.  I also noticed as I woke up that I also had hives, and it was red and hot and itching, blisters, all over my hand. I then contacted my PCP and they suggested Benadryl capsules. It took about a week for the rash to go away, I finally can wear my ring back (hands were very swollen). Now, I noticed I developed a cough about after a week after the vaccine. The rash is gone off my hands but the skin looks like it is peeling (reminds me of when a person has a real bad sunburn on skin and the burnt skin starts peeling off) from all the blistering and the rash on my hands. I did have COVID in late November, early December. I tested positive on 11/30/2020. The new skin that is being exposed is really tender and sore. I notice with each passing day skin feels better not so sensitive.  I get a little bit better each day, a little more energy each day.

                                                Pain at the injection site shortly after the injection. Pain and tenderness in bicep began generally later the first day and lasted 2 weeks; I still have some bicep stiffness and tenderness today on Day 18. I had tenderness under the right armpit for about a week (assumed swollen lymph nodes).I had redness on the bicep below the injection site on Days 5-7. I also was tired on Day 2, 3, and 16 and took short naps. I experienced some muscle twitching in the bicep on Day 1, which still continues. On Day 6, I woke up with muscle twitching all over my body, randomly and intermittently. I was able to go about my day normally, but every few minutes something would twitch for a few seconds (my right arm, my left arm, my left knee, my right hip, my lower back, my left pointer finger, my left eyebrow, my diaphragm, etc). I drank a lot of fluids and took magnesium, zinc, D, B, C, omegas, turmeric, a multivitamin, and ate a banana for potassium on Day 6 and 7. Day 7 and 8, I only had muscle twitching in the right bicep again. Starting on Day 9 and continuing through the present, I continue to have intermittent twitches lasting a few seconds all over my body again. It is less frequent than on Day 6, but continues.

Around 6:00pm the same day I received vaccine, I started getting chills and strong aches in my back and legs. I felt very dizzy, lightheaded and sleepy. Chills were gone by the next morning, but aches and sleepiness continued for 4 days. Dizziness and lightheadedness continues til now. A little over a week after vaccination, I had random bruising on my legs on the same side I received vaccine. My lymph nodes were visibly swollen and my breasts felt extremely tender. Bruises are still healing, but lymph nodes and breasts seem relatively normal now, exactly 3 weeks after initial vaccination

Lasted approximately 4 hours. Extreme dizziness for approximately 2-3 minutes while sitting still at 4 hour mark - resolved with rest except arm pain, which lessened slightly over the first hour but remained unresolved after 4 hours.  Within 30 minutes post injection - redness, heat, and swelling at injection site.   After injection (approximately 12-13 hours post injection) - Fever (100-101.7 consistently over 3 days), extreme fatigue, headache, muscle aches/joint pain, severe chills. Fever broke midday April 4, and other symptoms except arm pain and headaches slowly resolved by April 7. Arm pain remained at a fairly steady level throughout that time and past April 8 (one week).  Currently (April 14, two weeks post injection) - arm pain has lessened, but remains in upper arm. Particularly sensitive to touch or movement, but can be felt at rest. Redness is gone, but palpable hard lump and heat remain at injection site. Pain and sensitivity noted when medical provider palpated underarm lymph nodes on right side. Not noted in same action under left arm. Headaches continue intermittently.

                                                High fever for 24 hours. After than I came down with really nasty and massive number of cold sores (at least 20 of cold sores) all around my mouth, nose, inside two nostrils. Tip of my nose and nostrils are deformed because of size of cold sores inside my nose. It has been 12 days that I have this condition and sores are being persistent and there is no sign of getting better. I took several pictures of the affected area to document the case.

Onset of right eye not blinking/closing. * MAR 21st = Emergency Room.  Diagnosed w/ BELLS PALSY.  [Ruled out stroke]  The following week after my vaccination (approximately MAR 15th), I experienced a strange feeling at the back of my throat.  It can best described as a &#34;sore throat&#34;.  I noticed it upon waking up.   I could feel it at the back of my throat when swallowing;  the act of swallowing would enable me to &#34;feel&#34; the sensation at the back of my throat.  This was unusual and not normal for me.  I thought I was coming down with a cold virus.  I had not been sick for over a year and thought it was a strange feeling.  I was concerned.  With the recent schools, restaurants, and gyms opening up with less restrictions, I learned from coworkers that there was an increase of illnesses  because our immune systems are not as strong and germs are easily transferable during the usual interactions.  Therefore, I expected my sore throat to be the start of a harmless cold virus.   Then, later in the week (MAR 19th), I noticed my eyes were abnormally dripping tears.  It is my experience that I get this effect in the office setting or during winter when my eyes are &#34;dry&#34;.  However, I was neither in the workplace (office), nor was it winter.  I was not sure why my eyes had excessive tears coming out.  Finally, on SUN (MAR 21st), an obvious physical symptom finally became apparent to me and my family members.  My speech was impaired.  I could not chew properly.  I could not drink from a cup.  I struggled during breakfast.  I was not sure if I was having a STROKE.  I recited the alphabet to hear for a slurred speech.  I looked in the mirror, and my smile was not perfect.   I got dressed and went to the Emergency Room.   The doctors performed physical PUSH-PULL tests, eye tests, etc.   DIAGNOSIS = Bells Palsy.     OTHER SYMPTOMS = &#43; shortness of breath.  &#43; leg swelling.  &#43; headaches.  &#43; excruciating pain in the neck, especially during sleep (laying down).

                                                Right after the dose I got an immediate headache, dizzy and light headed. About an hour later I became nauseous and my face became very flush red and hot. I went to bed and woke up feeling like I got hit by a truck and was very tired with a sore arm. By the next day I was better. The following week I began with a red hot circle on my arm where the shot was given, it had a ring around it. That lasted for about a week. I then started to get stinging sensations in that part of my arm like I was being stung by a bee. These lasted for about 2 days. I then started getting muscle rolls/spasms in the same spot on that arm. They lasted about 3 days. I then started having pain in that arm like I had just gotten the shot and as I was rubbing it, I noticed a large indent in my arm. I went to the doctor, and they said they had no idea why it happened but if I get more symptoms to come back. The doc appt was on 4/12/21. It has been over a month of these side effects. Doctor not sure if it will be a permanent disfigure.

On 2nd and 3rd day I was having massive headache (felt like pressure from inside all over out to all cranial sutures), severe neck stiffness on rt side, lumbar vertebrate pain, iliosacral and hip pain, felt painful radiating spasms down my left and right legs, also jaw and teeth pain. Taking Naproxen and now ASA.  Very shakey and jittery. Occasionally have lower arm pain and numbness on left side. Also have injection site symptoms but minor compared to above. It&#39;s been 1 week and allergic part of rxn is over but concerned with possible neuro and bloodclot possibilties..  On day 2 or 3 I also had problems with my brain with reading comprahension.

                                                She got her vaccine, she felt the burning sensation all the way down to her fingers and her wrist.  I proceeded to go forward and wait the 15 minutes.  She then started to have pain in the side of her neck on the right side, discomfort and pain in her arm.  Within the hour she started to have headaches (has had COVID in the past).  She went home and it was a nagging pain in her arm, not at the site but the whole arm was sore and limited using the arm due to the discomfort.  That night is when she came on the news and started that the vaccine was being pulled from administration.  That night it was like a pulling sensation right in her upper arm, up near the armpit and the fatty tissue from the breast and where you raise your arm.  When she started noticing the discoloration started in her skin.  Her hands started getting black, under both arms were black, the back of her legs was black, and she started feeling worsening fatigue.  She started getting worried and was looking at how her veins turned purple blue/green just in the one arm.  She was trying to figure out why she had limited use of her arm, and was holding it as if she had a sling on it as when it hung to her side it had the pulling sensation and a crawling sensation in her veins (that night and going into the next day).  The next morning she was so exhausted and tired, as was her mother who had the vaccine at the same time, and was not feeling well.  She was feeling that possibly due to the fibromyalgia she was have worsening symptoms than her mother.  She then started bruises on her body, on the arm itself as if somebody grabbed and squeezed her arm, purplish/black bruising.  It had her forearm develop 3 large pockets of swollen, almost as if the medicine was sitting in her arm.   She was slowly getting the pulling sensation down to her hand, and she called the UC first and due to the high volume of COVID she wanted to know how long of a wait she would have.  They instructed her to go to the ER due to the development of the blood clots on the news.  There was no change in her symptoms, and got to the point that she could not move her arm, and the knots stayed in there and there was a reddish discoloration around them.  Now she was having a pulling sensation in her chest and palpitations of pain near her heart.  She was having soreness in her legs to the point that she was not able to walk, and felt it was in her nerves 3 days after the vaccine.  She stayed in the bed the entire week just due to the exhaustion and effects.   Every time she would go to reach for something she would have the pulling sensation down to her hand, and the entire arm was swollen with the bruising all over.  Her body started having purple and blue knots and also in the left leg.  Her arm and fingers were swollen as well.  She then started having itching of her arm, and her lips started swelling and got up and went to Hospital and was able to be seen.  She was having problems with her stomach as well, having a knot in the stomach where it was protruding and started loosing weight since the vaccine.    The ER doctor told her she had a reaction to the vaccine, and did a Doppler to see if she had blood clots.  They did not give her the results and didn&#39;t feel that she didn&#39;t have problems.  She also went to the UC and back and forth to the ER, and still had the knots and finally looked at the knots and her jaw was swollen, and her arm was still swollen.  The UC told her that she was having a fibromyalgia flare.  She is still having the same symptoms green/blue and have started protruding.   Due to the fatigue she has mainly just stayed in bed and knew that she was to have COVID symptoms, but knows that the crawling sensation and the knots sitting in her arm, and now her arm looks disfigured and the swelling is not going down.  They told her that the test was negative for the blood clots.  She had made an appointment with her neurologist and has an APT on Tuesday 5/25/21.   She continues to loose weight no matter how much she consumes and still continues to have the knots and pain in the arm.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, my throat began to swell and I began to turn red in throat and chest. I was observed by  County EMT for about 30 minutes. I was asked if I needed treatment while being observed but went I went home and took a Benadryl. The throat swelling went down but did take another Benadryl that night.  The next week, my left arm was swollen and I had pain in my hand and wrist.

I went to the ER and they said I have radial thrombus, a clot in the radial artery.  Before the shot, my heart was checked multiple times and I was fine. After the shot, my coronary arteries are now very small. There are now luminal changes inside my coronary arteries which are still now very small. I now have been diagnosed with CAD. I had a heart cath on March 29. My arm is still in a lot of pain. My neck is still swollen.

I went to the doctor - I saw a Dr - as mine was on vacation. They gave me amoxicillin and through taking that it went away. It&#39;s completely gone away. It doesn&#39;t hurt to poke at it anymore.

On March 20, 2021 I woke up with swollen lips and face, and hives on my arms, legs and trunk. I also had a cough, watery eyes and itchy throat, like typical allergy symptoms. I went to the emergency room and was treated for an allergic reaction. No one, including myself, considered the COVID shot as the reason. The hives were gone within 24 hours, but the other allergy symptoms lasted for one week exactly. They had not gotten any better with a variety of over the counter allergy medications. When I  went to my primary doctor for a follow up visit on March 29th  all of the symptoms were gone. They were the ones that recommended I sign up with the vaers system, and they suggested the possible/likely connection to the vaccine.

The next day the sore throat was gone, and body aches got worse. All my joints ache. I felt chilled in spite of outdoor temperature of 79, and a hot bath, blankets and sitting in front of a fire. It was 74 inside the house. I started to get a bit of a headache but it never developed into a full headache. At about 6pm (day 2) I started to get  hot. Anything touching my skin bothered me.   At about 7pm (day 2) I took two Tylenol and the symptoms improved by about  8:30pm.

                                                Vaccination was 10:30 am.  Around 6:30 pm, my right knee started to throb.  I took an epsom salt bath, where my upper back started to hurt.  I went to sleep around 8:00.  I woke up around 10 pm unable to open my eyes all the way.  I believe they were swollen nearly shut.  I could see a slit of light coming in from outside.  I couldn&#39;t move my left hand at all (left arm is where I received vaccination).  I held it up to the outside light, and it was swollen.  The light coming in from outside hurt my eyes.  I couldn&#39;t see enough to call for help.  Around 1:30 a.m., the swelling went down enough for me to open my eyes.  I have never seen them look so bloodshot.  It was scary.  I could move my hand again as well.  I spent next day in bed resting.   Monday, I noticed a small rash on my right shoulder.  I went to work and was there about 20 minutes before I started feeling hot and dizzy.  I went home and spent the day in bed.   I was able to go to work the next day, Tuesday, without problem.  One week after vaccination, the rash on my shoulder went away, but a small rash broke out on my right shin.  This one was deeper.  One week later, there are just a couple of small scabs left in the spot on my shin.  I feel my energy level is close to normal.

Took screenshot selfie of face with phone. 10-13 days after shot- gums felt inflamed near base. On day 13 went to dentist and he said looked like an allergic reaction/irritation, not gingivitis, as not above teeth but near roof of mouth. Speculated could have reaction to shot in combination with toothpaste. (Evening of shot had chills/ache/low grade fever/head pains/nausea/diarrhea next morning. Took over the counter Tylenol).

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included hypertension, and anaphylaxis to peanuts. The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: Unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 02-APR-2021 to right arm for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported. On 02-APR-2021, after vaccination patient experienced an anaphylactic reaction. The patient was at her local pharmacy and was waiting in chairs as instructed; then she walked to her vehicle and began to feel light-headed and lost consciousness. Her husband was with her and was able to administer life saving measures, the local pharmacist was able to administer an epi-pen to her right thigh. On 02-APR-2021, the patient stopped breathing and was then transported to the local ER(emergency room) where she was treated. She regained consciousness and had persistent emesis and the patient was kept in hospital for 24 hours before being discharged. The patient was hospitalized for one day. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from syncope/lost consciousness, and was recovering from light headed, vomiting/persistent emesis, and anaphylactic reaction, stopped breathing. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused/ Prolonged, and Life Threatening).; Sender&#39;s Comments: v0 A 52-year-old female patient with the past medical history remarkable for anaphylaxis to peanuts experienced anaphylactic reaction the same day the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine Ad26.COV2 was administered. The patient began to feel light-headed and lost consciousness, an epi-pen was administered. The next day the patient stopped breathing and was treated in the local ER (emergency room). Later she had persistent emesis. Given the close temporal relationship and history of anaphylaxis to peanuts the events are considered related.

                                                Had a headache within an hour, felt slightly flu-ish.. Developed a rash on my face on about  day three.  It kept getting worse and painful (swollen and near the eye) so I saw the doctor on April 16th.  He treated me for shingles.  The rash and pain was on the left side of my face and neck and in my hair.  I felt better on about April 20th except the headache is still there and I still have nerve pain in my hair and one spot on the left side of my head, near my temple.  It comes and goes.

She cancelled one of her appointments  she&#39;s a home health nurse and went to sleep and when she woke up her throat was swollen, hurting, labored swallowing and when she would drink her ears would pop, and her tongue was swollen but could breathe fine, and then it progressed to where she could not swallow at all.  She took two Benadryl&#39;s and went to rest, and she was not able to move and had to have help getting dressed.   Her joints are swollen, her hands are swollen, but her throat is not hurting like she was yesterday.

I typically get a single cold sore when I am on the verge of having a cold or flu, but not three at once. I also experienced pain in my left armpit (assuming lymph nodes) for two days post-vaccine.

                                                Given the Janssen covid-19 Vaccine EUA at pharmacy.  Left arm swelled right away and I lost around  3 tablespoons of blood from the vaccine site.  I am concerned that the vaccine came out of the arm with the blood.  I was asked to wait 30 min before going home.  The bleeding stopped after 30 seconds.  Swelling went down over next hour.  No other side effects.  I am concerned that I may not be vaccinated if the vaccine came out of the arm with the blood.

                                                Within an hour of the vaccine, I started to feel a fever blister under my nose and it was very painful. I woke up the next day and I had fever blisters all around my nose and inside my nose. They were very painful, and my nose was a little swollen. I also had a big fever blister on my lip which was really big. I went to the doctor and she gave me some antibiotic cream and they went down within four days of using the cream. Several of my coworkers had similar fever blisters.

                                                Muscle aches started about 12 hours after the injection.  First my legs and back but after another 12 hours it was mostly my legs.  Legs felt like the muscles were being pulled.  (It felt like the beginnings of the extreme reaction I had to ampicillin 2 decades earlier, though not nearly as severe.)  My arm swelled slightly, was warm at the injection site and ached about 12 hrs after the injection.  The leg aches lasted about 2 days, the arm ache lasted about 1 day and the slight arm swelling lasted about 6 days... Reason for my reporting:  I had an annual eye exam 4/14/21 where a retinal scan was done.  The optometrist saw some blood spots in my left eye and referred me to an ophthalmologist.  Ophthalmologist performed additional scans and tests including a Fluroescein angiography and determined I have BRVO (Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion) which is a series of blot clots in small vessels of the eye&#39;s main vein.  He did not say it could be a result of the vaccine but I have no risk factors associated with getting BRVO.  Since it is not affecting my vision yet, the doctor wants to monitor it in 3 months to make sure it has not worsened.  Since the Janssen vaccine was put on hold for causing other types of blot clots in women in my age group, I am wondering if the vaccine caused the blood clots in my eye.

                                                I had a severe case of Covid-19 in December of 2020 and was hospitalized for twenty days. The day after the vaccine I got swelling in my left leg which was severe and painful. Testing revealed that there were blood clots in my legs. I have been having problems with bold clots since having Covid-19. My blood Sugar was over 500 the day after the shot and my blood pressure was very high. My blood sugar has been under control for a long time, and it is never this high. I also started to get headaches daily which I am still getting but they are not as often. I now only get headaches two to three times a week especially toward the end of the work week. Before the vaccine I was getting the occasional headache, but they were controlled with Excedrin. The new headaches are only controlled with prescription medication. The swelling in my left leg is still happening on occasion. I had been experiencing Long Covid-19 symptoms before the vaccine but they were much improved and the vaccine seemed to cause all of the symptoms to regress.

Worsening fatigue as day progressed, developed runny nose and watery eyes, pain in my arm at injection site then spreading to the rest of my body.  Took Sudafed for the cold like symptoms that evening and then in the morning. Went to sleep woke in the morning with severe fatigue, nausea, headache. At 11:00 noted that a bitter taste in my mouth that lead to loosing my sense of taste for 6 hours.  I started getting a fever, which got up to 102 degrees, took Tylenol for this. At the same time my lips started swelling, then my hands, and approximately around 1900 my buccal lining of my mouth.  Took 50mg of Benadryl which helped with swelling and went sleep.  Woke up 6 to 7 hours later and took 50mg of Benadryl for good effect. Continue to have mild fatigue, headache and nausea this morning.

Day 3 I woke up with extreme sinus cavity pain on my left side and a stye in my eye which progressed to get very severe to the point of on day 4 the top part of my face swelling and being hot.  I called HCP and did a virtual visit and was placed on an antibiotic and eye ointment for 7 days.  At the end of the antibiotic being completely taken the stye was completely gone but there was a still an aching in the sinus cavity.  A week later it became severe again and my left eye started swelling underneath so I had another tele appointment with HCP and was given a 10 day antibiotic - Augmentin and antibiotic eye drops

                                                I began having a burning and tingling sensation around my ribcage on my right side. I attributed it to possible swollen lymph nodes as the result of the vaccine. I had tenderness there for about a week. It started getting better and on my right side in my waist area, I had a sensation on my skin with no visible rash or anything, but it felt like my skin was burning and tingling. I thought maybe I was getting shingles, but never broke out. The same pain then went to my inside upper arms, both of them and then it spread into my armpits. and down both my sides. At times, the sensation was across the top of my chest. There is no rash, there is no visible inflammation and my skin doesn&#39;t feel warm to the touch although it is burning and tingling to me. It has been going on now for weeks. I have taken naproxen to see if it was some kind of inflammation as an immune response and it has helped on some days but not on others. I feel stupid to make a Dr appointment because there is nothing to see, but the painful sensation is real. It feels like a really bad sunburn.

Later on she started to have fever, cough, and then headache.  She then went to bed and slept 7-8 hours, all day long.  The swelling stayed for almost a week in her arm.  Then approximately 4-5 days later on 3/21/21 the right side of her face, the lower part of her ear to the lower part of her face started swelling, and her lip was numb.  Fearing she had Bell&#39;s palsy which she had about 10 years ago she went to see her doctor and the doctor said that it was a reaction from the vaccine.  The right side of her face and the swelling is almost gone, but her face is still feeling numb.   Her doctor did not give her anything, and since her swelling was almost gone and was improving he didn&#39;t want to give her anything for it.  He told her to watch it and if it worsens to get back to him, and to report to VAERS.

                                                Upon injection, medication burned going into arm and lasted about 2 minutes.  I immediately started feeling odd over my entire body, I felt and looked flush,  felt clammy, muscle tightness,  started shaking, felt very nauseated, blood pressure went up and experienced slight swelling in hands.  This lasted 30-45 minutes.  My blood pressure, oxygen saturation level were being monitored.  I left office at around 12:00 pm feeling better.  I felt off the entire day.  At 6:00pm I started with chills, muscles aches and pains.  At 7:30pm I took a shower and went to bed very fatigued, muscles pain and cramping and chills. I took my daily meds of 125mg of Diamox, and 100 mg of Azathioprine.  At 11:30pm I woke up with a 104 fever, sweating, and a lot of muscle cramping in legs and feet.  My head felt like it was going to explode.  My cerebral fluid pressure was up and felt in head and down spin.  I did not rest well and found it difficult to get comfortable all night.  I took an 200 mg of ibuprofen at 12:00am and started to feel some relief.

Broke fever after 5 hours but headache remained severe for 18 hours.  Muscle fatigue remained for approximately 2 days.  Remained in bed until symptoms passed.   Arm swelled up on 4/4/21, area where received shot.   It was almost everything I experienced with COVID in Nov 2019 over the course of 3 weeks squeezed into 24 hours, having suffered before I knew to go to bed and didn&#39;t go to ER.   If I hadn&#39;t experienced this before I would have gone to ER.

Beginning on 3/19/21 she reported red and swollen lymph nodes with pustules on the left side near the armpit.  She nodes are still swollen and there are bumps but no pustules at this time.  Beginning on 3/24/21 she noticed a spot on her ridcage resembling Shingles, but it was a single pustule.  On 3/25/21 she noticed that the bottom of her feet started peeling and stinging. The skin seems to be sloughing off.  She made an appointment with her dermatologist for today, 4/9/21 but it has been rescheduled to 4/12/21.  The patient reports that she has history of chronic shingles and multiple autoimmune disorders. She takes daily antiviral therapy (valacyclovir).

I felt red and puffy in my face on that side. I ended up getting flu like symptoms, and my arm hurt for about two weeks. I went to urgent care March 29th and was diagnosed with bronchitis , I did get a Covid test and it was negative. They put me on a antibiotics and inhaler. I followed up with my PCP, she changed the inhaler I was prescribed and told me If I don&#39;t get better to give them a call.  My arm is better but bronchitis is still there. The coughing is really bad at night and sometimes during the day.

                                                Had migraines (frontal lobe with flashing lights-distorted vision and difficult to hold my eyes open) from 3/20-3/24. (one week after vaccine) I do not get headaches, so this was very strange. On 3/23, I woke up with a bright red Left thumb- it looked and felt like a sunburn.  The next day (3/24), it was still bright red (fire engine red), swollen, hot to the touch and had a blister in my webspace.   I went to the dr 3/23 pm who was not sure what was going on, but prescribed an antibiotic (Keflex). This reduced my pain and swelling. Today it is still red and is now flaky, but not swollen or hot to the touch.   The main thing was the migraines as I do not get headaches.   I&#39;m not sure if that or the skin thing is related, but thought I should throw this information your way in case there have been others with similar symptoms.

On Wednesday, I developed a cough, chills and fatigue that lasted all day. On Thursday, I was better. On Friday, I noticed swelling under my arm but closer to my breast.  I went to see my MD and was given something for the cough. My MD wants to watch the swelling under my arm for the next two weeks.

                                                next day extreme fatigue, fever lethargy.  Got better but never got energy back and had some body aches and trouble sleeping.  On Wed. March 25th an EXTREME headache began and I could find no relief with High doses of Tylenol or Ibuprophin or a mixture of both. It was my whole head. Stayed on the couch all day Saturday and Sunday  27th and 28th unable to move because of the pain and extreme fatigue.  Monday the 29th made myself go to work but was not able to function or get much relief.  On Tuesday the 30th went to see physician who said he thought it was Occipital Neuralgia and gave me prednisone and said use hot compresses. Told him I thought it was more due to other symptoms like hallucinations (shadows I would see) Mind not clear and made me worry about driving. Asked if the shot could be a possibility. He just said he couldn&#39;t rule it out.  The doctor also mentioned I felt very hot but never took my temperature. I Took the prednisone. Headache did start to clear on Wed the 31st in the evening but my neck seized up where I could no longer turn it to the left and was very painful. Also felt like my lymphnodes were swollen.  I called on call doctor and they prescribed a muscle relaxer.  I did not start to get better until Sunday April 11th. Experience a couple occular migranes as well during this,  Still experiencing some fatigue and almost to a fainting point in the mornings

After 4 days of that I got a really super heavy period with cramping and blood clots in my menustral flow.  It was a horrible period, while the one after the surgery in Feb was very light.  Dizzy and fatique  10 days after shot on the April 8 I took a fall from a chair outside, and from Thrusday to the Saturday  10th I ended up in the Emergency room with a concussion and head symptoms including dizziness and nose bleeds.  This was from a simple fall, and i suspect the covid shot might have caused complications after the fall with additional swelling and brusing.

                                                BLOOD CLOT IN LEFT THIGH; SWELLING; FATIGUE; This spontaneous report received from a consumer concerned a 55 year old female. Initial information received on 13-APR-2021, processed along with information received via telephone communication on 15-APR-2021 The patient&#39;s weight was 100 pounds, and height was 152.4 centimeters. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included progressive multiple sclerosis, swelling of the left leg and foot, and non smoker, and other pre-existing medical conditions included the patient had no known drug allergies. the patient was not a pregnant at the time of reporting. The patient had no family history of thrombosis, no prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1808609, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 total, administered on 22-MAR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included baclofen, escitalopram oxalate, and risedronate sodium (received 2 doses and stopped after the event).  The patient&#39;s husband reported that in MAR-2021, the patient had symptoms of fatigue.  On 23-MAR-2021, the patient had swelling and fatigue.  Her fatigue was resolved on 24-MAR-2021 and swelling was resolving.  On 05-APR-2021, the patient developed left thigh swelling. On 06-APR-2021, the patient&#39;s swelling was not going down and she visited her primary care physician. The physician could not determine the cause of swelling (left thigh very noticeable clot swollen around where clot was located) and the physician suspected clot and performed an AD dimer (fibrin degradation) test to look for potential blood clotting. The patient also had a venous duplex ultrasound that showed left leg clot.  At 19:00 on the same day, the patient&#39;s physician advised to visit emergency room and determined there was a clot on left thigh and she was prescribed Eliquis Starter Pack (apixaban) for 3 months treatment and recommended another scan in several months. On 06-APR-2021, the patient&#39;s vitals were reported as blood pressure 124/70 mmHg, heart rate 88 bpm and oxygen saturation of 99%. Laboratory data included prothrombin time (PT) 13.4 sec , International normalized ratio (INR) 1.2 and  activated partial thromboplastin time  (APTT) 34.8 sec. (Normal range not reported for all) d-dimer and platelet count results were not available and Covid-19 test was not performed. Body max index was 19.5 kg/m2. On an unspecified date the patient was feeling better but had not recovered from the event. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from fatigue on 24-MAR-2021, had not recovered from blood clot in left thigh, and recovering from swelling. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This case concerns a 55-year- old female subject, immobile due to progressive multiple sclerosis who developed a left thigh swelling 12 days after Janssen COVID-19 vaccine was administered intramuscularly for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.  The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included body max index of 19.5 kg/m2, progressive multiple sclerosis and swelling of the left leg and foot. She is a non-smoker, no known drug allergies, no family history of thrombosis, or prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Symptoms started with swelling of the left thigh and fatigue. The fatigue resolved the next day. The patient&#39;s swelling in the left thigh was not going down and she visited her primary care physician who checked her D-dimer dimer (level not known to patient) and scheduled a venous duplex ultrasound that showed a clot in the left thigh.  Her vital signs were blood pressure of  124/70 mmHg, heart rate 88 bpm and oxygen saturation of 99%. and she was prescribed Eliquis Starter Pack (apixaban) for 3 months treatment and recommended another scan in several months. Laboratory data included PT 13.4 sec, INR 1.2 and APTT 34.8 sec. D-dimer and platelet count results were not available and Covid-19 test was not performed. The patient is feeling better but had not recovered from blood clot in the left thigh, and is recovering from the swelling. Given underlying progressive multiple sclerosis with immobility and preexisting swelling of the left leg and foot on the same lower extremity, the clotting of the left thigh is considered not related to Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. Additional information has been requested.

                                                On first day I had headache within 4 hours and chills.  Later that day I started having fatigue.  The fatigue has basically continued .  About 3-4 weeks in my left arm started tingling then on or about May 10th I started having back pain and joints hurting which I had lifted a case of water and moved a piece of furniture ever so slightly and I normally recover from something like that next day - I have been on anti inflammatory and other meds without relief.  Went to a chiropractor which  made things worse.  I&#39;ve had on and off episodes of fever/sweating and joints and back have continued to hurt.  Doctor did a UA test to rule out any kidney or bladder problems (history of) and my WBC was high for me - course of antibiotics and I still dont feel well.  I&#39;m usually pretty pain tolerant , not a complainer but I have felt not myself since the vaccine.

                                                About 30 minutes after receiving COVID-19 vaccine by Janssen, patient reported having an itchy throat and some feeling swollenness in her throat. Pharmacist asked if she could breathe and she confirmed she can. Pharmacist asked if she would like to be administered IM injection or oral version of diphenhydramine and patient requested IM version. Pharmacist administered diphenhydramine 25mg intramuscularly and monitored for response where patient reported feeling better and less swelling and itchiness. Patient requested an additional dose due to incomplete resolution of symptoms and about 2-3 minutes later, pharmacist administered an additional dose of diphenhydramine 25mg intramuscularly. Pt was monitored for about 40 minutes until her spouse came to pick her up. Patient was advised to contact her provider and potentially request and epinephrine pen for on-hand use. Pharmacist found a pharmacy, CVS, that carried the epinephrine pen and informed patient where that was so she could inform her provider where to call in the script. Patient left premises reporting feeling like she could breathe fine and no swelling upon leaving the store. The store also provided patient with a box of diphenhydramine (Benadryl) oral tablets to take with her as well as a bottle of water. Her spouse took her so she would not need to drive after feeling potentially drowsy upon injection of diphenhydramine.

                                                General swelling in the armpit under the shoulder that received the injection. It&#39;s sore, and making my arm lightly achy and my hand tingle off and on. I assume it is due to the lymp nodes being super-activated under there. I have had Covid-19 twice (May 2020 and Jan 2021) and guess it may be related to a super-ready immune system. Also, it has re-activated some of the covid symptoms--chills, exhaustion, headache, and a dimming of my taste and smell, which had not even fully returned since the January 20021 bout of Covid. Now I can only discern sweet/sour/salty, with a momentary hint of what I&#39;m eating during the first bite or sip, before it&#39;s gone again. Complex mixes of foods, like a taco, for instance, would taste like nothing at all. Zero. Single note flavors, such as orange juice, are weakly flavored at first, then gone after a taste or two, like the tastebuds are used up. Most of the ability to smell is weak again, as well. I do wonder if the losses are due to inflammation response and not the virus activity itself, in light of this?none

On 4/17 a burning redness and swelling of her legs bilaterally which worsened and she became unable to walk secondary to pain and swelling. Also reported shortness of breath. The rash was initially wheals spreading up legs with pain, burning and allodyina to light touch. It then spread to arms bilaterally.  She admitted to Medical Center and discharged with dx of urticarial rash with petechiae. I saw her 4/19 with painful palpable purpura, significant diffuse joint pain, puffiness on all 4 extremities and starting to appear on abdomen. Areas on legs where condition originally started had began clearing. Likely Henoch Shonlein Purpura.

Patient states the the pain and swelling has increased over the last couple of days. She states she does have a history of varicose veins. Advised patient that due to receiving the J&amp;J vaccine within the past 3 weeks, she should proceed to the nearest ER for evaluation. Patient was resistant to going to ER due to her uninsured status and asked that I contact her PCP for a second opinion. A message was sent to physician who agreed patient should be evaluated in the ER. A return call was made to patient, and again it was reiterated that she should proceed to the ER and the risk associated with not proceeding as instructed. Patient agreed to be evaluated in the ER.

I went to my PCP and he measured my legs and sent me to hospital because he said that it looked like I had blood clots. While in the ER, they started performing tests, and they found a DVT in the left leg and to PE&#39;s, one on each lung. I was under observation because I was given Lovonex to thin my blood. While in the hospital the swelling started to go down and that is when I was discharged. I am now seeing a vein specialist and a pulmonary doctor. I was given Eloquis 5mg 2x per day. I am still having pain and swelling in both legs, but the leg with the DVT is worse. It is very hard to walk around because my left leg will swell a lot.

The unexpected effect is tingling and coldness in both hands/fingertips.   I could logically assume it is from the swelling in the neck pressing on the nerves, as I have experienced a similar feeling occasionally in the past due to compressed discs in my spine and neck.  At this point I am not particularly alarmed but I wanted to make you aware of this side effect.

Progressed to coughing and feeling a lump in my throat and then tightness in my chest. My blood pressure elevated to 152/100. At that point I self administered epi pen and paramedics called 911. This provided relief but after about 5 to 10 minutes the tightness in my chest and the feeling I couldn?t get a deep breath began to return and the paramedics administered two puffs of an albuteral inhaler and transported me to the hospital. At the ER, they did an EKG, started an IV and administered fluids, prednisone and Benadryl. I was discharged about 90 -120 minutes later with a prescription for 3 days of prednisone (50mg) and instructions to continue to take 25 mg oral Benadryl every 4 hours.  The next morning my face and chest were red and looked like I was sunburned. My face was also swollen.

                                                After my vaccine I had tenderness in my right arm at injection site and a sharp pain in my right clavicle bone. The clavicle bone pain slowly went to an ache. But then I noticed my arm was ballooning up a d the injection site was hard. Then, About a week after my COVID vaccine, I experienced leg pain (left) behind my knee and my arm was getting larger and warm to the touch. My first appointment with my doctor was 3/24/2021 at 1215pm. He checked out the areas and ordered a ultrasound Doppler of my left knee. I called the vaccine center as it says on the paper given with the vaccine. I spoke to someone and explained my symptoms. She suggested a ultrasound of my arm as well. I called my primary care doctor who added my arm to the order.

                                                After my J&amp;J vaccine, my right arm felt hot and was red and I also ended up with an upset stomach, had diarrhea and felt sick to my stomach. I also experienced chills, low grade fever of 99.8 and had swelling to my joints in my fingers and toes. My right arm pain radiated upwards to my neck. These symptoms lasted 12 hours and as of today I still have pain in my neck. Since 03-15-2021, I have been seeing a chiropractor for my neck pain. I see him on a weekly basis. At the chiropractor&#39;s office they apply ice, heat and do a muscle rub help with my neck pain that still is present.

                                                The first thing that happened, 4:30 pm the following day, extremely nauseated and starting throwing up (I was driving and had to pull over) and felt super dizzy which was vertigo. Drove home, had severe diarrhea , chills, fever. My arm swelled up and hurt. My lower back was in severe pain. My upper right back thigh - between the buttocks and knee had a horrible pain in it. Very severe pain and it started radiating down my calf muscle and then to the front of shin. Stayed for days on the back of my thigh in my right leg. I continued having very severe vertigo. I would have to run and throw up if I tried to move or go back to bed. The nausea never went away. That was lasted for 8 days. I went to my doctor&#39;s office - I drove to the office - they moved all the doctor&#39;s across town for Sutter and I couldn&#39;t make it before they closed and I had to go home. I couldn&#39;t make it. Just driving there was impossible - It was really bad. Didn&#39;t have  a doctor visit at all then. The dr. prescribed a medication for vertigo. The pharmacist said to buy the OTC medication for vertigo so I bought it but it didn&#39;t help. That made me doped up and sleepy but still nauseated. I got a spike behind my ear on the right hand side of head - in that little pocket - headaches would come there.  I still have weird vertigo and dizziness - intermittently- although I always have a dull nauseous feeling. Every now and then I have to run and throw up - it&#39;s like my body is tired of feeling dizzy. Flying in the airplane - looking out the window - made me super nauseous  - so I had to close my eyes and not look at anything. Still have the nausea and vertigo. I have mild dull headaches still. Did have golf ball size lump on arm and couldn&#39;t raise it but now it&#39;s gone.

                                                I felt fine immediately after the injection - just a little pain in the arm where I got the injection and when raising my arm. By 6:30 pm I was achy all over and my legs were aching a lot. When I went to bed around 8:00, I hurt all over (achy and flu-like feeling, but no fever). I dozed off and on and about midnight when I woke up, I had a very rapid heartbeat. This went on all night and into the morning. It was hard to get any sleep at all. When I&#39;d get up to go to the bathroom, I was slightly dizzy and unsteady on my feet. After I got up at 6:30 am, the highest my heartrate got was 113, then it finally began going down. I was still hurting all over, felt extremely tired, and now had fever - 99.8. The fever lasted off and on all day and into the next night. I was also very nauseated all day and I felt extremely bloated. I also had a bad headache. When I woke up on Friday, my fever and the headache was gone, but I felt extremely tired and weak and still nauseated. I slept most of the day and I still ached all over, but not as much. My lymph nodes were also swollen. On Friday afternoon, I walked up to the mailbox and I was winded and unsteady. On Saturday, I felt a little better, but was still extremely tired. By Saturday night, all the aches, pains and headache were back and I didn&#39;t sleep well at all. I rested most of Sunday and felt a little better Sunday evening. The aches and pains were going away, but I was still very tired and exhausted. I felt the same way when I woke up on Monday morning. It seemed like the vaccination made the aches and pains I normally had with Fibromyalgia about three times as bad as usual. And I was still very bloated feeling all over. By Monday afternoon the nausea finally went away. By Monday afternoon I was feeling a little better, but still tired. On Tuesday I felt better still and I noticed that I wasn&#39;t bloated as much. It seemed like I was getting back to normal.

It has gotten smaller but is still visible today on 4/8/21 , six days after the vaccine.  Additionally,  my lymph nodes under my left arm swelled 36 hours after the injection and were swollen for 4 days. I took two 500 mg of tylenol daily for 4 days. I was very fatigued for 48 hours 24 hours after the injection.

I was prescribed Augumentin to take for 7 days and tylenol for pain and to follow up with my PCP.

To this day I am still dealing with the headache, the pain not just in the arm but allover, gastro intestinal problems. It has impacted my sleep tremendously because the level of pain is very high. The one thing that went away that very first night was the low fever.  But this vaccine is like a Wish (cheap store) Vaccine. They SHOULD NOT give this to immunocompromised people and the &#34;few days&#34; rhetoric does not apply to us and that should be specified! Initially I thought this was to be expected when I heard a Doctor on the news say: &#34;if you fell like you got ran over by a truck, that is normal.&#34; So,  that is how I felt, so I thought it was normal.

I woke up with a swollen juggler vein that ended up being a blood clot, 10 days later my arm was swollen up twice the size of my leg, the juggler was still swollen. I call the urgent care nurse they said to go to ER. I went to hospital got a CAT scan and ultrasound, I was given a shot of warfarin that was supposed to last for 12 hours. I went home and the next morning instead of going to the hospital, I went to hospital and they found 2 blood clots in brain, arm and leg and neck. I have had no history of blood clots and this all happened after the J&amp;J vaccine. They did a procedure where they tried to put a balloon to relieve the pressure. The blood clots in the brain cannot be removed because of their location and it would be dangerous to remove and I am on blood thinners for the rest of my life. Multiple blood clots in body brain, arm and shoulder.

                                                When I received the injection I immediately felt an electric current flow up to the right side of my neck. It passed quickly though. Around eight hours later I developed stiff muscles in my right neck. It became twice the size and was very swollen. I called my PCP and I was told to use moist heat. I used a warm washcloth and kept heat to it. I did not take any medication until the following morning. I took Motrin at 6:00AM. The next day I still felt sore and it took a few days for the muscle ache to go away. Two weeks after the vaccination I started having numbness in my hands and feet. I figured it would just go away and didn&#39;t pay much attention to it. 05/25/2021 my right hand was very numb and my right arm was very achy. I went to urgent care because of worry for a blood clot. While at urgent care, I saw a physician, he ruled out a blood clot, but he said that I may have Peripheral neuropathy. I was told to follow up with my PCP and it was suggested to see a neurologist.

The headache lasted a solid 24 hours almost to the point of vomiting even while taking 4 tylenol every 4 hours then my stomach was empty so I ate a few crackers, but that next night it was hard to go to sleep.  At night I suddently realized my forehead seemed larger than normal!  It really felt bigger and swollen  so I massaged it and could feel my layers of skin/dermis moving around I beleived it was the serum from the shot from all the prone position I was in for so long laying in bed.  Thankfully the next day all syptoms went away gradually and by the third day I was back to normal....at least I THINK my forehead has returned to normal so far as I can see or feel.

                                                Within 25-30 minutes I felt a very sore area on my right side just up from the bottom of my rib cage. I reached for it and I could touch the exact spot with one finger. It was almost like if you had run into the corner of a table really badly. It came on fast. Within less then 10 min later it felt like a small balloon was getting inflated with the sore spot right in the center expanding. The soreness was not that big just this strange feeling like that area was expanding just like a balloon. I would say it was about an 8&#34; circle. This strange feeling and soreness lasted all evening. It even woke me up in the middle of the night. It was slowly gone by the end of the next day. The next day I only felt a little tired and not well. Nothing major. I have not heard of anything like this. I have no doubt this was from the shot. I had only gotten in my car to drive home. As soon as I pulled in my garage it came on very suddenly. No other reason for this.

                                                I felt pain in the arm, I could feel the shot going into my arm. Within an hour it got extremely painful, I could hardly move it, I could not raise my arm. For the next 3 days, I could not lay on my left side, I could not use my arm and was extremely painful. I also noticed my lymph nodes were all swollen and sore, the ones in my neck were the worst, I had a severe headache, I was extremely fatigued and body aches. The body aches were excruciating. I was bed ridden for 3 days . I also had nausea and completely lost my appetite. I remember being very thirsty. I had really sever fatigue, it took a week before I started feeling better. I had to take a week off of work. I&#39;m having a really hard time with fatigue now. It seemed to cause what I would call is a huge flair up of my fibromyalgia .

                                                She got her vaccine at about 6:30, and the bottom of her foot started swelling, then the to of her foot, ankle, tingling of her feet (both), neuropathy pain came back which she hadn&#39;t had in a long time.    The spinal stenosis pain came back very strongly and her fibromyalgia pain came back and they were all pretty well managed prior to the vaccine.   She is still having that pain.  She is on a pain management regimen to control her pain prior to the vaccine, and then it has worsened and was scheduled for an epidural spinal shot and not able to get off the Eliquis due to the vaccine and that has been postponed.  She was on Duloxetine for the neuropathy pain and it had been being managed and then all of a sudden that pain has worsened and the medicine she was taking for that did not work anymore.  She went to the ER on 5/5/21, and they gave her Morphine for the pain, and discharged her home with Tramadol.  The 2nd ER visit was on 5/15/21, as when she woke up both of her legs were numb, and could not feel her legs from her ankle to her hip/waste area.  When she opened her eyes she thought she was looking at the side wall and was looking at the ceiling and could not discern where she was, was disoriented and called her doctor and told to go to the ER.   She went to the ER and they finally took it seriously and they suggested that she had inflammation in her system that was causing her other problems to flare up.  She made appointments with her specialists to see where the inflammation was.  She then saw a rheumatologist as when she went to the ER the 2nd time they wanted to put her on steroids and she did not want to be put on it due to her diabetes.  She did have drug-induced lupus at one point from isoniazid.  Her rheumatologist confirmed she did have inflammation on blood work and told her to take the steroids.   The steroids have taken down some of the pain, but not completely.  She did have a lumbar epidural steroid injection yesterday 6/9/21 at L4 bilaterally, which has helped as of today.   She was put on Tramadol after the first ER visit by her pain management doctor and that did not work.  After that she was switched to Hydrocodone which has helped her.    Her cardiologist, rheumatologist and PCP told her that it hit things that impacted her nervous system and that she has inflammation in her system, does not know exactly where it is and it has impacted her system and caused intensity of her spinal stenosis, neuropathy and fibromyalgia.  She is still undergoing treatment for these symptoms.    She was not feeling her neuropathy pain hardly at all prior to the vaccine.   On She woke up and both of her legs were numb, and could not feel her legs from her ankle to her hip/waste area.  When she opened her eyes she thought she was looking at the side wall and was looking at the ceiling and could not discern where she was, was disoriented and called her doctor and told to go to the ER.    She has not been able to return to work as a teacher due to the reaction she has been having.  She wants to know what the efficacy is now that she has had a reaction or has it lessened or does she have any protection at all now.
