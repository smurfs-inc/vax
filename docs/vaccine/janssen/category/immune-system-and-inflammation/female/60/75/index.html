Overall I felt as if I had a terrible case of the flu. It was very intense. I was unable to sleep the first night due to the severity of symptoms. The second night I sweated a tremendous amount and my fever broke. I am still not over all of my symptoms but I am feeling better.

                                                Shot immediately started stinging.  My upper arm swelled with a hard ridge about 3 inches long and 1 inch wide.  Extremely painful.  Could barely raise my arm and could not sleep on that side or tolerate even soft touch of my entire upper arm.  No other reaction that seemed like an allergic response.  I did get very sick for 2 days with severe flu symptoms and strange shooting pains in random parts of my body.  Enough pain to wake me from a sound sleep.  Bad chills, but no fever. I did. I give my legs seemed swollen for about 3 days.   I got the J&amp;J vaccine on 3-6-21 and my arm is still swollen with a slightly smaller hard and painful ridge at the injection site and it sometimes throbs and itches severely.  Today is 4-2-21.  Starting to wonder if it will ever go away.  I still cannot sleep on that side.  The pain overall is less, but it still throbs and itches periodically throughout the day.

                                                I got an itchy rash on my right leg within the first 15 minutes, staff at the site tried to get me to belief it was from anxiety. The redness subsided though bumps remained when they let me go home. I also felt a bit &#34;detached&#34; on the drive home and really had to concentrate on my driving. Once home, I still felt odd but went about my day. About four hours later, I realized I was scratching my stomach and chest while watching TV. Upon raising my shirt, I saw a bright red rash on the top part of my belly that extended underneath both breasts and to the area directly over my heart, and up my left side into my left armpit. All of these areas were very itchy. I put Hydrocortisone cream on them, which helped reduce the itching quite quickly. I then took half a Benadryl tablet. When I awoke the next morning, the areas that had been bright red now had dark red dots but did not itch. However, I had lines of a bright red, itchy rash on both thighs near my groin. I again applied Hydrocortisone cream and took Benadryl, which helped abate the symptoms. Lymph nodes in my left armpit were quite sore as well, so I took ibuprofen.

                                                Started on Monday morning at 8:30 am started feeling cold chills.  Took 800mg of Ibuprofen and after an hour felt better.  When going to bed around 9:00pm I noticed that my skin was soaking wet and that I had a hot feeling.  When I woke up in the morning  (tuesday April 13, 2021) around 7am I could not fully open my eyes.  I looked in the mirror and noticed that my entire face was swollen and was red in different areas.   I took some benadryl as I thought this was an allergic reaction and went back to bed.  A litter later I started getting cold chills and then hot flashes.   Around noon time I took another benadryl.  By 2:30 I was not feeling any better and I also had body aches and pains and called my doctor.  I was able to get in to the office.  I was told that I was having a reaction to the shot and that I was boarder line for the hospital.  They gave me a shot steriod shot and prescribed Metheylprednisolon tablets (24) to be taken as directed and to continue to take benadryl.   It&#39;s now Wednesday morning April 14, 2020 and the swelling has gone down but not fully gone and I have stated on the prescription.  I now have redness in my chest area.  I still have a some chills and hot flashes.

                                                I woke up Wednesday and I felt like I was hit by a train. I felt like a wet dish rag hanging on the sink. Everything hurt, even taking a step, I just felt bad, tired like the flu but no respiratory issues. By the 14th I started getting short of breath, couldn&#39;t walk without SOB, my legs started to swell, joints were sore, I felt tired. Went to the doctor and my blood pressure was high, I was prescribed medication for my blood pressure and fluid pills. It hurt just to brush against the skin on my calf. An ultrasound revealed 4 blood clots in my left calf. Went to the ER at .  Hospital in  and sent to hematologist Dr.  and there were no findings.

                                                I am filling out this report today because I received a follow up call from the website because I had reported loss work, loss of job, loss of activity and visits to doctors. I received the vaccine on March 12, 2021, I started having arm and shoulders symptoms the day after getting the vaccine but did not feel well that first night while trying to sleep. The symptoms worsened every day, I am in week 11 post vaccination. I have had 22 medical appointments with 3 to PCP, 13 to Physical Therapy who diagnosed left bicep tendinitis and shoulder impingement many weeks ago, 4 to acupuncture, and 1 to xray. This Thursday I finally get an MRI. I lost my job on week 7 after the vaccine, I can barely use my left arm, I live alone, I am exhausted and spend much time chasing a diagnosis or help in resolving this issue. I reported to website every time the link was sent to me. I called the Pharmacy on Day 3 and called Janssen hotline on Day 3 to report a reaction. I wrote to my doctor on Day 5 to say something was not right. By the next day I had an injection site reaction, very hard swelling in my arm, a dark red jagged surface reaction at the injection site now there is a divot there. Feeling very unwell, aches and pains, no fever. I had bad abdominal cramps that night after the injection, diarrhea for days, arm pain with swelling, joint pain in shoulder, knee, and fingers, and a  rash across my back, I had to continue to work, typing fast 9 to 10 hours a day, I am a self-employed contractor doing tax technical support and the pain in my arm grew worse daily, I was in tears trying to work. Sitting to type, to read, to drive is the worse. I can dictate into my devices but not rapidly enough for the level of my work. The worse pain in my arm and shoulder is less by avoiding typing and driving  but the injury is still there. The pain is constant even without movement.

The shot location in my left arm itched a lot. I scratched it, it bled. It became a large hole. 3 days later approximately, I start feeling very very tired. It got progressively worse . I then developed &#34; brain fog&#34;. I have barely been able to work since then.. I believe I started to recover yesterday but not completely sure yet. I also developed a painful tumor in my right arm pit that lasted for a few days. It has since gone away. It was approximately 3/4 &#34; in size. It developed overnight.

                                                The evening after the vaccination, it triggered my asthma. I consulted my doctor and started breathing treatments (levoalbuterol) twice a day. At 5 days post vaccine, the asthma improved but I came down with a very sore throat and also noticed a enlarged lymph node. It was so painful I could not talk or eat. I was tested for strep and was negative. I was prescribed budesonide to calm down the inflammation and I took cough drops. I am still suffering from sore throat but it getting better. Right below my jaw line, I have an enlarged lymph node that is sore to the touch. I am having difficulty swallowing, talking and eating. I am still having these symptoms.

                                                Was out shopping with friends and feeling fine but when driving home I noticed a high pitch sound in my left ear that abruptly started for no known reason.   I have pollen allergies to trees and due to staying indoors and wearing a mask I was having no bad allergy symptoms and never had tinnitus on my worse pollen day.   The tinnitus symptom was loud enough to notice over all other noise and very irritating in a quiet room.    The high pitch sound was non stop and constant.  I went to sleep that night and woke up Saturday morning still hearing it.  I felt that morning like I was having a very mild cold with very mild congestion.  I felt likeI had swelling under my ears    I was not tired but I did feel like staying in bed and sleeping  as if my body was mildly requesting it.  I slept most of the day.  Woke up with the high pitch sound but it seemed a little bit lower in volume.  Around 8 pm the sound left as quickly as it came

                                                The next morning, 09:00 am, I had mild flu symptoms which was full body aches and feeling feverish and unwell. I didn&#39;t register a fever on the thermometer. I was very tired; no appetite. I stayed resting all day. Slept a lot. It was easy for me to sleep - very unusual. By 9:00 pm that all lifted and I was feeling back to normal. The morning of March 28, I woke up with a very sore throat. And on 3/29, I had really continued sore throat on and off and Tuesday it got much worse. There was a really strange sensation of being extremely thirsty - I had never had experienced that before. Swollen gland on the right side of my throat - between the jaw and ear area. I had a little bit of an earache on the right side. I drove by the drive-in testing area. I am working in person each day so I get the drive by testing - I think Tuesday, the 30th. Called the dr and did the Telehealth visit - Wednesday - the 31st. I had in and out of laryngitis - raspy voice and headache. I looked in my throat with flashlight and could see a definitive red spot in back of throat and some white spots.  They said it could be a blocked salivary gland and told me to eat something very sour to activate it. Over 6 to 8 hours it did clear the issue somewhat - thirst went away. I still had a sore throat. They told me that by the weekend, I could maybe start antibiotic. Saturday night I took first dose of Zpack - two tablets at first dose and then one tablet a day after that. By late evening Sunday (Easter) I felt some relief of symptoms. This week I still have a little bit of raspy voice and post nasal drip and clearing my throat at this point. I am recovering but not fully recovered.

The pressure eased off quickly but the tingling lasted until the next day then my face felt like I had been punched. I still have a little face swelling and itching with raised red spots on my face that move around to this day.

Prior to that, I had run a fever, and had my whole upper arm swollen and hot , which have both just started to subside.

Left ring finger went numb, white and cold, with bruise appearing on the middle digit. Other finger tips turned pink. Skin turned red onhands with tingling sentation. Right hand blood vessels came to the surface and began to swell at intersections. Skin on rt. hand looked whiter and dry. The sudden onset sent me to the emergency room, the condition began to fade in 3 hours, not completely. The same reaction occured the next day at 12 noon. I took a hot shower and the condition improved followed by extreme tiredness. *At the time of vaccination, &amp; on both of these events I had a stiff neck/red skin.

Of note is that her rheumatoid arthritis has been worsening for the past 2 months since she stopped taking Xeljanz 3 months ago. (Her rheumatologist closed his practice and she was unable to establish with new one till 4/9/2021. Exam then showed now inflammatory changes in joints.

I took a Zyrtec-D the morning of the injection so I think that helped keep the swelling under control.  April 15, 2021-around 6:00 pm I became very nauseous and dizzy.  The nausea subsided by the next morning but the dizziness has continued to this day.  Had to stay in bed all day April 17 and 18 due to dizziness.

                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I received the single dose at 10:40.  In approximately 11 minutes I started to experience shortness of breath.  I thought it was my N95 mask so decided to head to the car after my 15 minute wait period was completed.  After sitting down in the car I started the following symptoms:  shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, swelling of face, dizziness, weakness.  I sit in the car for approximately 15 minutes then headed home.  I had a driver (thank goodness).  I continued to have symptoms and what felt like elevated blood pressure (I did not have access to a pressure cuff).  After resting at my driver&#39;s house for about 5 hours I felt better and headed home.  The next morning the symptoms were less but still present.  In addition I had a slight rash on my stomach that wrapped around my back.  After approximately 48 hours all of the symptoms subsided.  My blood pressure had returned to normal also.  All swelling went down.

                                                2 hours after I received the vaccination, I came down with severe chills.  My entire body was shaking and I could not get warm.  I got extremely fatigued to the point that I could not get out of bed.  I got a severe headache (and I get headaches a lot...this one lasted for almost 10 days).  It seemed that every bone and muscle in my body began aching, from head to toes.  My fever went up to almost 102.  These symptoms continued for a course of four days, except the headache and fatigue (which lasted for approximately 6 days and the headache for 10 days).  I alternated Tylenol, Advil and Alleve.  They did not help hardly at all, unfortunately.  2 weeks later, I developed lymph node swelling in my right arm pit and alongside my right breast.  Today, these lymph nodes are still swollen and are painful to the touch.  I experienced pain at the injection site and if I touch it, it is still painful today, but does not ache like it did initially.

Then on the 15th or 16th I noticed that the roof of my mouth was hurting, was sore. So I asked my husband to check it for me because I could not see it very well and he said there was a sore on the roof of my mouth. Yesterday I asked him to check again and he said it was even worse. I am going to see a doctor today, appointment today at 12:30PM. I also saw another Dr. also at the same clinic on 04/14/2021.

                                                It started with body aches, headache and sore arm at injection site. Left side -left leg started getting swollen - it started in middle on knee part - the swelling went down my leg to my ankle and up my leg; up my thigh . It was like there was fluid in my leg. There was no pain.  It went like that for 1 1/2-2 months. Just had to let it run it&#39;s course. I was being treated for it and had tests run to test for blood clot. She prescribed 800 ibuprofen  for it; that didn&#39;t work. That same day of the vaccine, I also broke out with a fever - 102. And fever blisters all over my mouth. I had those for about a week.

I was speaking with a friend, who is a nurse, and she told me to take a Benedryl, so I ate a 12.5 milligrams children&#39;s chewable diphenhydramine.  Twenty minutes later I felt normal again.  Later that evening I noticed the palms of my hands were very hot.  I did not have any fever.  That passed the next evening.

                                                March 13, 2021-1:30pm-Shot administered to right arm-it bled and the nurse had to apply pressure with an alcohol swab. It stopped immediately. 1:40-started feeling a tightness in the muscle in my neck under my right ear Stayed a few minutes longer than the required 15 to see if anything else presented. Mentioned it to the nurse and rep. The rep asked if I was nervous about getting the shot. When I said yes, he said it may just be that. Told me to contact my doctor with additional issues.  1:55-When leaving the parking lot, I felt my lips and nostril on the right side go numb-it felt like when Novocain is wearing off after a dentist visit. As the day progressed, the area under my ear and down my neck got more and more sensitive. My lips continued to feel numb. My injection site was tender and black and blue. When I went to bed at 9pm, I began experiencing lots of pain in my right lower jaw. I took a Tylenol but it didn&#39;t alleviate the pain. I called on-call doctor. Since I already had taken a Tylenol, he suggested an anti-inflammatory and warm moist compresses and to contact him again if things worsened. 3/14/21-7:00am-Upon awaking, my jaw pain was virtually gone but the whole area I had had the issue with was very tender to the touch. My lip still felt a bit numb.  3:25pm- It is now 26 hours since my vaccination. I still feel like I had trauma to the right side of my face and neck because it is sensitive to the touch. I also have a continued slight sensitivity of my lips on the right side. My glands on both sides of my neck now seem tender, as well. 3/15/21-3/17/21-I continue to have random pain/tenderness in the aforementioned areas. I also have an aura of tingling in my brain from time to time.

Approximately a week later, the patient experienced stomach cramps and diarrhea and 1.5 weeks later she had foggy feeling in head and &#34;believes the vaccine is contaminated&#34;, had fever blister, facial pain and vertigo. Approximately 3.5 weeks after being vaccinated the patient experienced pressure choking and difficulty swallowing. A throat (ENT) specialist was unable to diagnose and they felt there was some autoimmune effects. A month after being vaccinated the patient experienced stomach burning sensation, night sweats and tooth pain. Given the close temporal relationship and the nature of the events, the events of sinus inflammation, sensation of pressure in ear, injection site lump, chills, felt ill, injection site pain and fatigue are considered related to the vaccination. The insufficient information precludes a meaningful medical assessment of the remaining events, including &#34;autoimmune effects&#34;. The events will be assessed further when additional information is received.

Found to be in sepsis and ARDS with multiple negative COVID tests including an extensive respiratory viral panel, we have failed to culture any bacteria from multiple sputum cultures, Legionella antigen and HIV negative.  Have been treating as ARDS 2/2 atypical pneumonia, possible aspiration (although no aspiration event reported) with hospital course complicated by VAP.  Concern remains for possible reaction to Janssen vaccine.  Still admitted to ICU at Hospital.

Developed a rash on face. These all developed within 15 minutes of receiving the vaccine. Took a benadryl to be safe shortly afterwards. Itching lasted for approximately 2 days. The rash is still about the same.   There was also swelling at the injection site, plus a rash that developed at the site about a day later. Other symptoms, such as fatigue, tiredness, and achiness, seem to be more typical outcomes.  Also developed a swollen lymph node under the arm that received an injection. This occurred two days afterwards.

About a week ago, same thing - swollen lymph nodes in my neck (or throat area)  - that lasted about a day and a half also. Two and 1/2 weeks later, when I developed the swelling and pain in my paratoid gland in my left jaw. Severe swelling - could barely open my mouth. So I saw DR,  on the 19th of March. She prescribed a Z-pak antibiotic and the swelling took about a good week to two weeks and maybe a little longer for the swelling and everything to go away. I was on antibiotic for seven days. Since then I have had no other problems.

I went to  clinic on 03-26-2021 for evaluation.  They put me on 3 day steroids. I went back to First med which they put me on a 6 day course of medication of steroids. I then went to my podiatrist, of my right ankle, I was scanned for blood clots but no blood clots were found. My exams only identify swelling and edema. I can only take NSAID&#39;S. I have to get up wait a few hours to move. My ankle swelling and edema nerve decreases and my feet hurt so bad when I apply pressure. I had an MRI done as well and I am very upset that they cant find why I can not walk without pain and swelling. My doctors at this point do not what to do for me and I would like some answers.  To this day, I am still having  swelling and edema to both of my feet and ankles.

I felt lightheaded and needed to sit for awhile after the shot. The next night I started getting pain in my right arm and I couldn&#39;t move it. My nerve endings in my arm, shoulder, and clavicle felt like they were on fire. The lymph nodes under my right arm and neck were swollen. I had three swollen lymph nodes in my neck, but one went down, and I still have two swollen nodes in my neck. My quality of life has suffered because the pain in my arm is so bad.

                                                Saturday night around 9:45 my hands and arms began itching.  Then i noticed they had broken out in a red rash with whelps beginning on my arms.  It then began breaking out on my face and legs.  I took 25 mg of benadryl.  The rash continued to spread so  I went to the ER. They administered prednisone, pepcid, and benadryl.  After about 1 hour the itching was better and the rash began to fade but it didn&#39;t go away.  The ER sent my home with a predisone dose pack for 6 days and to take 50 mg  benadryl every 6 hours.  When i awakened this morning I had the rash on other sites on my arms, legs and stomach and in my right eye, it was red and a little swollen.  I took the first day&#39;s dose of prednisone and 50 mg benadryl and 20 mg of famotidine. After about 30 mins to 1 hour the itching and redness improved but has not completely gone.

                                                Rosacea flare up within 10 minutes of injection. Face bright strawberry red. Entire body became hot and had to fan myself (not a hot flash) Approximately 45 minutes later left ear started tingling and then pain followed and only in left ear. An hour after the shot ( and back home) started feeling tingling in lips and face. Face swelled up and smoothed out wrinkles. Lasted about 2 hours and then subsided.  Also metallic taste in mouth during swelling of the face. Metallic taste lasted as long as the face swelling which was about 2 hours. Loose stools and tummy upset which is still going on.

Right away after receiving the vaccine-- stiff neck on the left side which after a night&#39;s sleep, moved to my right side of neck. No big deal.     Tired &amp; &#39;drunk&#39; after the vaccine which lasted until mid-afternoon the next day.  No big deal.       The worst of all happened at 3 1/2 days, a rash started in the evening, went to bed, woke up the next day with rash almost everywhere. Red, swollen, &amp; itching like crazy.   The next day- Sunday, along with Monday &amp; Tues. was horrid. I am covered from my scalp to the tops of my feet, my crotch hurts, as do my breasts. Used Benadryl cream, aloe vera to no avail.

                                                Right after receiving the vaccine my thumb started to swell. I took a picture of it because I couldn&#39;t believe the size. For the next three mornings I woke up with a headache. I took Tylenol and it helped get rid of the headaches. I started to see unexplained bruising on my arms and legs a week after the vaccination. To this day, I still have bruising, but it is going away. I noticed that I was getting Petechiae (tiny red, flat spots that appear on the skin). I noticed a bruise on my breast ( I am a breast cancer survivor and have had reconstructive surgery on my breasts.) After the bruise started to disappear, my skin was already thin from radiation, but the skin started to open up and expose my silicone inside my breast. I had to go to the surgeon and my implant had to be removed. Now I am flat chested on that side. This is going to take several weeks of recovery to get through this. The surgery for the removal of the silicone was 9PM PST, Emergency Surgery.

                                                Six hours after the vaccine I got chills, headache, stomach upset and swelling in my lower face and throat. I had body aches all over my body but no fever or pain at the injection site. Those symptoms lasted for ten days. I went to ER. I was given medication for the nausea and pain. The chills were a little better by then. The medication helped with everything but the headache. The headache is constant at the back right of my head. I then get other head pain at the same time in my temples on the left. It is a sharp shooting pain. I get flashes of light in my eyes and my eyes start twitching at the sides. I also get pain at the top of my head on the left hand side on occasionally which comes after the temple pain. I sometimes get head pain on the right side with deep concentration. I have recently started to get tremors in my right hand. Sometimes the headache wakes me up at night. I wake up every day with a headache and it has been thirteen weeks. I can not drive or concentrate. I have seen a neurologist but I am still having trouble scheduling scans. I have tried some prescription pain medication and it did not work. I have taken two courses of steroids.

                                                At the time, I had very mild injection site pain and warmth on the site. For a couple of days. On Monday, the 15th, I had the worst flare-up of sciatica that I have ever had in my life. Left leg - it had a tremendous swelling. It was crippling. I am still using a pain. I cried because the pain was so horrific. I was able to get into the doctor early on Tuesday - prescribed Prednisone; hydrocodone; muscle relaxer. None of which touched the pain. I was unable to sleep for three days. I slept upright in a chair. I used an office chair as a wheel chair. I wasn&#39;t able to lay down. I&#39;ve improved but I still can&#39;t walk to the mailbox - could walk down there - two houses down but couldn&#39;t get back. I am using a cane still. I have to elevate leg on a recliner to sleep so it will help with the continued swelling. There was nothing I did that triggered it.

It took about 3 days after the benadryl to disappeared.

                                                Immediate extremely strong metallic taste in mouth.  Tongue and lips a little puffy. Very inflamed lymph nodes in neck.  Metallic taste went to gums, and I could feel the metal taste scallop across my teeth, from left to right.  Felt a sweaty sensation on top of head, like I had a bowl on top of my head.  Metallic taste started going down my throat.  Soft palate swollen causing gagging due to uvula touching my tongue.  Could feel the sensation on my head inching its way down my head.  It stopped at the hairline  above my ears, which made me think that I was getting in feeling in my hair follicles and not a sweaty sensation.  Stayed 70 minutes at site.  Metallic taste mostly gone.  I was told to pick up some Benedryl.  As soon as I took it I felt a strong pounding in my ears.  When eating dinner I could feel a slight constriction while swallowing.  The next morning  the lymph nodes in my armpits were extremely sore.  Neck lymph nodes stopped being sore Saturday, but are still a little swollen.  Lymph nodes in arm pits were better on Sunday, but are still sore if pushed on.

(Right Axillary Node) Patient is retired healthcare worker. She said upon palpitation the node feels &#34;golf-ball&#34; sized. She stated it does seem to be shrinking in size by this morning.

Thrombocytopenia was reported without a reported platelet count. The patient was subsequently admitted to the hospital for unspecified number of days and was reported to have recovered from all events. Given the patient&#39;s extensive medical history, there is a plausible alternate explanation for swelling of legs and venous stasis ulcers, and there is limited information to make a meaningful assessment of the report of thrombocytopenia. Additional information is requested.

Patient was found to have a right parietal multifocal parenchymal hemorrhage measuring 19x36x37mm and small right temporal lobe SAH. Subsequent CTA showed thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus and the right frontoparietal cortical veins as well has nonocclusive thrombus of right transverse and sigmoid sinus. The patient was also noted to have focal seizure of mouth and tongue and was loaded with phosphenytoin. After discussing case with neurology, nuero IR, NSGY and family it was decided to transfer the patient to sunrise for close monitoring and consideration of cerebral venous sinus thrombectomy if she worsens. I had a long discussion with multiple sisters about the risks of anticoagulation with argatroban given the IPH but the necessity given the cerebral venous thrombosis. I also discussed that argatroban is not readily reversible and that heparin is contraindicated if there is concern about vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia due to possible PF4 ab related to HIT. The patients VITT modified 4T score is 4 and she is intermediate risk for this being VITT. #Right parietal IPH, right temporal SAH and Superior saggital sinus thrombosis with nonocclusive thrombus of right transverse and sigmoid sinus -concern for vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia given johnson and johnson vaccine 2 days prior -modified VITT 4T score of 4- intermediate -send fibrinogen, d dimer, consider IVIG 1gm/kg per day for two days if high dimer, low fibrinogen and falling platelets -will start argatroban, avoid heparin until HIT ab (PF4) is resulted, if HIT positive avoid heparin -neuro IR consulted for possible IR intervention if worsens -transfer accepted by sunrise ICU, appreciate transfer for IR evaluation -continue phosphenytoin -SBP goal &lt;150 with nicardipine and esmolol gtts -monitor daily fibrinogen, dimer, coags #AKI- monitoring uop and cr, consider renal US if worsens #DM- ISS #HTN- nicardipine and esmolol gtts for SBP &lt;150, target 140 Patient seen, examined, labs and imaging reviewed, agree with resident note

                                                On MON evening after the shot, at 11:00pm I experience severe chills that lasted for hours. Tuesday morning I awoke with a bad headache and had body aches all day as well as tendonitis- like pain in both lower arms. I felt somewhat better on WED but I did notice that my compression sleeve on my right arm (lymphedema arm) felt more snug than usual. That night I had severe chills and fever of 101. I slept until 11:45am on THU and felt aches all over. Very fatigued. Went back to sleep from 2:00pm until 6:00pm. Temp was down to 99.8.  When I woke and removed my compression garment, my arm was red and swollen, also rash-like bumps, and was very warm to the touch. FRI morning it looked worse, so I contacted my lymphedema specialist and then my PCP. This is NOT a good situation for anyone who has lymphedema and will necessitate months of treatment.

                                                On Saturday, I started itching in the inside of my lower arm between my wrist and elbows (both -  mainly my right arm but left arm was itchy too). I had splotches like a rash and light red bumps. My arms puffed up a little (both). It looked like corduroy fabric -  red like line indentations. I started using aloe vera. That helped a little bit. I had some Cephafil cream (OTC). I thought I had a reaction to something in the soil from yardwork I was doing. I had redness and a rash in my knuckles - between palm in my hand and my knuckle of where it bends - they were red; rough and raw. There was a little rash on the tops of my hands. I went to the doctor on the 12th and he prescribed. I used it for four days: Trimethadione cream with an acetate name on the end of it. My right arm did have a little swelling around the elbow joint.

                                                First night had chills, very slight nausea and low grade fever (99.3) the next two days.  On the morning of April 7th I woke up with a swollen lip.  Throughout the day the swelling continued on the left side of face, then on bottom of right foot and later on top of both feet.  Went to emergency room and was treated for hives.  Over the next five days, the hives kept moving around, the right side of face, and then to upper lip.  I followed up with my Primary Care Doctor, who did extensive allergy testing.  All came back negative.  I felt that it was a result of my body reacting to the vaccine.  In addition, I was feeling weak muscles and joints that kept moving around.

I was I guess what the doctors call in remission until I had a Johnson and Johnson Covid vaccine on April 2, 2021. Guess I should start with the side effects from the vaccine...2 days after receiving it I was very fatigued for 2 days then on day 7 my collar bone started to hurt, thinking I had slept wrong I just ignored it.  On day 8 my lymph nodes under the arm that I had the shot started to feel swollen. After checking I did not feel any lumps but if it was still there the next day I was going to call my doctor. My niece and 2 of her friends were discussing it and all three had the same reaction (all had Modena) I started reading more on line regarding this and saw that it was just a side effect.  Well 10 days after shot my hands and knees started to hurt by one month the pain was terrible.  After going to both my primary doctor on May 24th and my RA doctor a week later and having had all the blood work done. My RA doctor stated all my bloodwork was fine and she believes that the Covid vaccine was causing the Enbrel not to preform like it should. All I could find in  was one regarding a man with RA taking Enbrel and after having a Covid vaccine having the same issue.  My  doctor told me to try the Enbrel for another 2 weeks and if not better she no found one lady that takes infusions for her Rheumatoid and had flare ups also after her Covid Vaccination.  There is also a man  in his 50?s that went there the same thing. He was on Enbrel and had to end up with steroid shots.    would try me on Humira. Well I read that didn&#39;t work either on the man I mention below. I am hesitant to change from Enbrel to Humira as I have had great success with Enbrel. Also I have Can you shed some light on why this is happening and have you had anyone else report this?

                                                04/19/21 TELEPHONE CALL: I was asked to call this patient who has been experiencing a rash and swelling  since 4/9. She received the J&amp;J vaccine 4/8. Rash described as very itchy, starting on extremities, especially wrists, hands,  arms, legs, back. Not anterior trunk, not head or neck but head was itchy. She  had swelling where the rash was/is, no asymmetric swelling. Much of it has  resolved - she states it is &#34;much better&#34; now. Now the rash is mostly just on her  hands and wrists, with a little swelling. Her joints do not bother her. No headache, fever, pain other than usual achiness from her medical conditions  that include myasthenia gravis and DM. No flare or change in symptoms or state of  her chronic illnesses. She has been taking benadryl at night, 12.5 - 25 mg, since 4/11, and using  hydrocortisone cream on the rash. She has had a new puppy since  4/13. She gardens and works in her yard. She is active in walking, gardening,  weeding, and her activity has not decreased since this began. Although she could  have been exposed to weeds or plants in her yard that she might react to, she is  covered when she goes out, long pants, shirt, boots etc. She has not used any new  soaps, detergents, etc; cannot think of any new exposures. I offered medical evaluation here, but she is comfortable monitoring it at home  since it is getting better. I advised her to come in for evaluation if rash or  swelling became worse, asymmetric, or if new symptoms begin.

                                                The day after the vaccination i had aches and chills, lasted about 24 hours and then went away completely.  About a week after the vaccination i started to get pains in my joints and bones, especially the left elbow.  I also had a swollen underarm gland in the left armpit.   Now over a month later the swelling has gone away but I still feel achy at times.  Recently, I have been experiencing a fatigue and real tiredness that prevents me from being as active as I had been.  Not sure it is from the vaccine or my diuretic or my blood pressure medication, but I have been on those about one year with no problem.  I am wondering if it is the vaccine.  I never had joint pains prior to the vaccine.
