                                                About a week after the vaccine I had welts all over my body. They were like the welts that I had when I had Covid-19 in July of 2020. The welts came and went for a while and they were mainly on my left side. I woke up with them and then they would come and go during the day. They were hard raised welts and it lasted for three weeks. I also seemed to have allergic reactions to some foods. I went to the ER on 04/29/2021 three weeks after the vaccine. The welt on my wrist was very red and swollen and I was concerned. I was prescribed an antihistamine. It helped with the rash and other symptoms.

                                                I experienced an overwhelming amount of itching and right after getting vaccinated I experienced extreme swelling in my fingers my right ankle and underneath my feet. I was told to take Zyrtec. It helped but I still experienced itchiness and swelling. I consulted a dermatologist who diagnosed me with dermatographism and concluded my skin responds to the excessive itching by a trauma response known as petechiae. I also have gained a lot of weight since become vaccinated and rapidly. I have not changed my eating habits.

Day 2 a bit better but still low grade fever of 101 degrees, nausea, weak, body aches but not as bad. In the evening around 5pm noticed ears starting to enlarge but didn&#39;t think much of it, by morning today at 7:30am I felt my face was swollen and numb on the right side. Now both ears were swollen and the area in my face was red. When I took my temperature on my forehead I was normal however the swollen cheek was 102 degrees. At that point I went to urgent care to get it looked out.  Currently at 6:30pm on 4/3/2021 the redness in my cheek has turn back to normal however the face is still swollen but not as bad.

My friend told me that my forehead was puffy (swollen). I laid down and I realized I was really really cold but skin was hot to touch. I think I had a fever.  I was shaky and shivery and trembling. I tried to take a nap. Fell asleep for an hour - don&#39;t remember that time at all - but my friend told me I went to sleep. My smart watch was telling me my heart rate was 120s and 130s while I was sleeping. I debated whether I should go to the Dr. and I called the school police and they took me to the ER   - at 03:00 am on the 8th - and they told me to rest for  day and wait it out. I still feel like I have a lot of adrenaline - my watch says that my heart rate is way to high for what I&#39;m doing. It&#39;s usually in 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s but it&#39;s in the 120&#39;s and 130&#39;s every day and I am really shaky with adrenaline. I have had a headache since Wednesday night and it hasn&#39;t gone away. If it goes past Wednesday, I will go to my primary care doctor but otherwise no treatment at this time.

                                                Pt&#39;s throat and tongue and jaw felt like it was swelling. She had extreme pain in her arm and her hands started swelling. She got a rash on her arms and on her hands. I took her to the urgent care facility and they gave her a shot of Decadron and a shot of Benadryl. They also Prescribed steroids. She was very sick like she had a severe flu. I was very worried as her mother. She was weak and slept constantly. Her arm could barely move and It almost appears as if she had had a stroke. She had brain fog and she wasn&#39;t remembering her days like she was missing memory. After five days, the reaction started up again so we took her to the emergency room. They did a variety of tests including a urinalysis, CT of the brain, ECG 12 lead, peripheral venous duplex of her upper arm. Everything checked out OK so they put her on more steroids and sent her home. Pt is still having arm pain a month later but finally feels better.

We called 9-1-1 to check vitals and they recommended going to her doctor or the hospital in case of additional swelling.  We called the doctor and they told us to try Benadryl.  This worked a little bit, but she is still in a lot of discomfort today (Saturday after Thursday shot).

                                                My arm swelled up about 30 minutes after the injection near my shoulder. I started feeling pain in my forearm and the facility nurse gave me an ice pack. I stayed an hour after the shot and the nurse said I should be fine, so I went home. Around 10 pm I started having a really bad reaction, worse than normal flu symptoms. A fever of 102 and body chills that lasted for about an hour. Heart rate also consistently stayed above 130 bpm. I drank a lot of water and took an Advil. I then was advised to take a warm shower, and this helped bring my fever to a 99. After the shower, I became really nauseous and started throwing up. I was debating going to the ER. I also drank chicken broth and a lot of water and did not go to sleep until 4 am.  The next two days I had a low fever and bad muscle aches throughout my body, the flu symptoms ended in 4 days.

                                                Headache that evening and that lasted for about two days. Around 11 PM that same night of vaccine - I had chills but no fever. The second and third day I was super fatigued. Everything was okay after that but a week and a half later I was receiving severe stomach pain and a little blood in my stool. That is what brought me to the ER on 23rd when I had the blood in my stool . I had a rash on the back of my thighs  and I had swollen lymph nodes on each side of my neck that started after that. I went to ER again last weekend and that ER was at another location - no tests were done there. They told me to take OTC Tylenol. I still have the swollen lymph nodes and the rash is getting better not completely gone.

I woke up and the rash was gone.

Following day it was still there, so we took her to the Emergency Room where after an abdominal cat scan she was diagnosed with mesenteric adenitis.  They gave her total to manage the pain and sent her home to let the symptoms subside hopefully after a few days.  Today she is better, but very tired.

                                                My daughter got the shot at 1 pm on the 8th of April, 2021. (My daughter &amp; I both got the shot at the same shot at the same time). By 11:00 pm my daughter started complaining with feeling dizzy. She kept saying she felt like she was going to throw up, meaning she was nauseated. She was complaining with her bones hurting. We both got these symptoms at the same time. We both stayed in and out of the shower letting the shower water just run on us. I had to give her ibuprofen because she complained of a mild headache &amp; the pain all over her body. She couldn?t sleep at all. She cried. It had her scared. I fully believe she?s having an allergic reaction to the Janssen shot. I have fully read the Janssen ?fact sheet?. My daughter was having hot flashes &amp; cold sweats. She has ongoing symptoms &amp; it?s been 2 days since receiving shot including fever. She was having what I thought heart palpitations. We both swelled up causing our bodies to feel tight. We both were healthy before receiving the shot. We?ve never had covid nor tested positive. We are currently going to receive a check up by a doctor. The side effects of this medication is dangerous &amp; doesn?t compare to flu like symptoms.

I woke up 4/13 with a very swollen and puffy face, and the aches are still here. I?m normally very active jogging and in the gym, and I haven?t felt anywhere close to normal - fatigue and aches go hand in hand.  4/14 I had a very swollen face, continued aches and abdominal pain.

Fatigue every day and reduced activity levels and work.

Thursday I felt mostly fine just some tiredness and a little weakness. Friday evening I started to feel light headed and then by Friday night I felt a lump in my throat and my neck felt like it was burning. The burning continued into Saturday. I went to the pharmacist and he told me to take some Tylenol and an antihistamine. That helped a lot with the burning feeling. Sunday I felt very weak all day and felt more of a slight tightness in my throat. Monday the weakness and tightness in the throat continued just not as extreme.

                                                Got the shot at 9:20am on Saturday (April 10th). By the time I sat down to do the 15min waiting period before I could leave. My arm from the back of my shoulder all the way down to around my thumb joint in my hand ached so bad. By around 3pm on the same day, I started to feel really tired and had a pounding migraine. By 4:30p I started to get really cold and everything started to ache. By 6p I was feeling hot but at the same time cold and shivering. My head was pounding. Every muscle ached all over my body, and by every muscle I mean even my eye muscles and pelvic floor muscles. My face had so much sinus pressure that it felt like it could explode. My skin, all over my body, was so sensitive that it hurt to the touch. On top of my skin being sensitive to the touch, off and on my skin would tingle, including the inside of my mouth and tongue. My lymph nodes were swollen enough in my neck that my throat ached.  I was mentally confused and shaking. Everything got bad enough I started crying and hyperventilating. I felt sick to my stomach and felt digestive pain. My entire body felt so heavy. By the time it got to around 8p, my mom finally took my temperature, which at that point I had already been taking Tylenol all day and was no longer shivering, and I had a temperature of 101 degrees F. I finally went to bed around 9p. I was thirsty but my stomach felt sick. I still ached and woke up around 10 times throughout the night either feeling too hot or cold or hurting so bad. At 4am I took a Tylenol because it everything hurt bad enough to able to fall asleep. The next day. I mostly better. I was still tired and a little achy and my lymph nodes under my arm pits were swollen. At this point my lungs felt strange. Harder to breathe than normal.  I was starting to cough. The day after that (today) I have felt fairly normal except I?m coughing and my lungs still feel a little strained. No more aches or fever or anything like that though.

                                                I was running on the treadmill and all of the sudden my feet started tingling. I got off the treadmill to try to massage my feet. Then, I felt nauseous and vomited. After vomiting I could not move and I had very hard time walking. I noticed that my face had swollen, my throat was closing, and my vision was blurry. I also broke out in hives. Once I could get mobile (about two hours after the adverse reaction started) I took a Benadryl and that helped ease the swelling.

                                                The night I got the vaccine 3/10 my arm was sore just like any other vaccine I?ve received. Two days later, I woke up and noticed a welt on my arm that was about two inches in diameter. It was itchy and painful. I could not lift my arms up. By noon it had doubled, and the slightest touch was unbearable. The ?Covid arm? was also hot in temperature. That night, it was at its worst at 5 inches in diameter and it was even more swollen. It stayed that way for three more days before it started to go down. A week after my vaccine a bruise developed where the welt was. Two weeks after my vaccination it was still bruised and swollen. It felt like a tide pod when I touched it. My mom encouraged me to go to urgent care. So on 3/26/21, I went to urgent care and was told it was a cyst. My arm is currently still squishy at the welt and bruised. I have an appointment on 4/19 at my dermatologist for further care.

                                                Vaccine was done at 2:50. Around 6pm I started getting a headache, neck pain and my lymph nodes were enlarged. Took 1000mg of Tylenol. At 1030 pm, I started getting all over muscle spasms, headache returned, onset of dizziness, nausea and uncontrollable shaking. At 1145pm, I started vomiting, the muscle spasms got increasing  worse, the shaking only decreased while in the bath tub in very hot water. No fever was noted with thermometer, but after a second dose of 1000mg of Tylenol at 1am, I broke out profusely sweating 30 minutes later.  The uncontrollable shaking stoped at about 4am, along with the nausea and vomiting.  Upon waking up the next day, muscle spasms were still there as well as the headache and dizziness. By end of day 4-10-21 (today) all symptoms have resolved but the headache.

About an hour later my entire body was aching and I couldn&#39;t stop shaking with chills. I couldn&#39;t move or turn in my bed without my entire body just hurting. Even the blankets and clothes I had on were hurting my body. I tossed and turned throughout the night. At midnight I woke up to use the bathroom and my face and eyes were hurting. Once I got into my bathroom and looked in the mirror, my face was a little swollen and my eyes were a little puffy. My forehead and cheeks were a little red so I took my temperature and I was running a fever of 102.

On Wednesday I went to the Hospital and for chest pain (when I would breathe in), shortness of breath, rapid heart rate, and a fever (on Monday). They rain many tests with chest scans and found all to be clear except I had a ?extremely elevated? white blood cell count. They said they ran blood tests and did not think I had blood clots and they did an MRI and chest x-ray and could not find anything. They sent me home to rest. The rest of the week I had trouble breathing and it slowly started getting better on Friday.
