I also was experiencing a heavy chest and shortness of breath. All but one of the adverse events went away after 24-36 hours - the shortness of breath and shallow breathing have persisted up through today. I am very aware of my breathing and how my chest feels tight, like I&#39;m not getting enough air.

Patient did not hit the ground or injure herself-she did not lose consciousness she was flushed and sweating.  Pharmacist sat on floor with patient for 2-3 minutes and gave her water, patient was then able to stand up with little assistance and brought to sit down.  Patient stated she felt nauseous and may vomit she was given a trash can but did not vomit she was able to drink a bottle of water and was given a soft pretzel.  After about 10 minutes she stated she was feeling much better was no longer flushed or sweating she called her boyfriend for a  ride home.

When the leg pain started, it started behind my knees. I was in tears for about 14 hours in excruciating pain due to the muscle aches and I am still having random hurts of sharp muscle and joint pain.

                                                On Sunday morning i woke up to my left arm being swollen, red, hot to the touch. Over the course of the next few days the swollen part got bigger to the size of a baseball Tuesday I called my doctor and they wanted me to get seen right away at the ER. They did an ultrasound  right away and they ruled out a blood clot and an abscess. They figured it would just be an infection. They put me on an antibiotic for 7 days up to 4x a day. Today 4/21 I took my last dose of the 7 days. Called my doctor and they are starting me on another 5 days of antibiotic to get rid of this infection in my arm. It is now down to a quarter size or a little bigger. Hoping that in the next 5 days it will be completely gone. I don&#39;t have the redness and heat anymore just a smallish lump.

                                                I woke up at 3 am Friday with cold sweats and body aches. Took 1000 mg Tylenol. Woke up again at 10:30 am to a fever still and this odd extremity feeling. Felt like I had a compression body suit on and weight of 50 pounds around my arms and legs, Mild shortness of breath. I felt like I was swollen but did not see any. I called my PCP and vaccine line and both nurses said go to the ER. I went to the ER they ran tests. The time of the ER I started getting leg cramping and spasming. Those symptoms continued to the weekend. On Sunday the weight and swelling feeling went away. I still had bad muscle cramping and swelling. I did telehealth on Tuesday with PCP and was given muscle relaxer which helped some throughout the rest of the week. Thursday night I have a temp pf 99.6 and went up to 100.6 on Friday morning. On Friday I became shortness of breath and fatigued. It became difficult to go up and down stairs or walking about 20 ft without difficulty breathing. I now have a lower right leg muscle twitch/spasm that comes and goes. I switched to a different PCP, he ran more blood work on Wednesday 4/21. And discussed the next steps for treatment and monitoring.

                                                At 10pm on 5/18/2021 I started having side effects, 9 hours after vaccination. My face and ears were hot and my body was cold, I felt very fatigued. I took Tylenol before bed and woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat. I woke up officially at 8am and felt my face and eyes were swollen, I also had chest tightness. I looked in the mirror and it looks like I was punched in the face. My left eye (the side I was vaccinated) is significantly more swollen than my right side. Since 8am, the swelling and puffiness hasn?t gone down in my face, however, the chest tightness went away. I took Benadryl. It is now almost 4pm on 5/19/2021 and I still have the same amount of swelling and puffiness in my face. It?s extreme enough that I can?t go out in public like this or else someone will think I got beat up. There isn?t any bruising, rather, under each eye there are very prominent dark circles with almost a reddish tint. It seems like this possibly could be an allergic reaction but after reading online it seems like allergic reactions would have happened right after vaccine. I noticed this side effect 19 hours after vaccination when I woke up on 5/19/2021. If it?s not better when I wake up tomorrow on 05/20/2021 I will goto urgent care.

                                                3/26-vaccine 3/29- pain, swelling, redness, hot to touch, hard lump at injection site. Was mostly gone by 4/9. As of 4/15 hard lump remains at injection site. 4/6- 12:15pm hives, redness, itching, burning on sides of upper thighs, buttocks, within 2 hours hives spread to backs of arms, all the way down legs. Went to quick care facility at 2:30pm. Waited in waiting room until 3:50pm checked legs with doctor at 4:00pm and little red dots appeared in random clusters down both legs. Doctor assumed folliculitis, prescribed Cephalexin. 5:00pm took 50mg Benadryl while waiting for prescription. Picked up antibiotic around 6:30pm. When I got home around 7:00pm both legs were burning. Discovered huge painful red patches all over both legs. 10:00pm took 50mg Benadryl again. Went to bed 4/7- 9:00am red patches still painful, burning. Took 50mg more Benadryl. Spent most of the day sleeping 4/8- hives gone due to benadryl. Red patches slightly less painful. New red patches/dots appeared on ankles and tops of feet 4/9- red dots spread over tops of feet/toes, new itchy bumps with red dots appeared trailing down the backs of calf area on both legs. 8:30am went back to quick care facility. Saw new doctor who instructed to stop taking antibiotic and switch to cream form of &#34;triamcinolone 0.1%&#34; twice daily. Also referred to dermatology specialist. 3:30pm first application of steroid cream made legs burn and feet/ankles swell. Determined too much was used 4/10-4/13 smaller amount of cream applied twice daily as directed. Burning stopped but feet/ankles still swollen each day 4/13-original large red patches mostly cleared. New red dots on backs of calves and tops of feet still prevalent. 4:00pm saw dermatology specialist who determined red dots were a form of vasculitis. Ordered blood and urine analysis to determine if other organs have been affected. Scheduled appointment with laboratory for 4/17 at 11:00am Other symptoms: dizziness, abdominal pain/pressure, diarrhea at various points throughout the day from 4/9-current

Because of reported incidence of cerebral sinus thrombosis or cerebral vein thrombosis patient appropriately presented for screening in the emergency room and was sent for appropriate imaging.   April 16, 2021 CT scan of head with and without contrast no acute intracranial hemorrhage, no mass-effect or midline shift.  On contrast-enhanced images there appears to be a lobular nonocclusive filling defect in the far lateral right transverse sinus.  Lobular occlusive filling defect is also likely present in the mid to central right transverse sinus.  Short segment filling defect in the medial left transverse sinus.  Remainder of sinuses and internal cerebral veins are patent.  Focal lobular filling defect within the confluence of the right and transverse sinus most likely related to arachnoid granulation.  No edema hemorrhage of the cerebellum or cerebrum.  No other significant findings.   April 16, 2021 confirmatory MRI angiogram of head without contrast with no restricted diffusion to suggest acute or subacute infarct.  Contrast void in the middle to central right transverse sinus consistent with occlusive thrombus.  Nonocclusive thrombus in the far lateral right transverse thrombus.  Narrowing of the medial left transverse sinus without complete occlusion.   April 16, 2021 2345 hrs. inital hematology consultation.  D-dimer and fibrinogen levels have been requested stat and are still pending.  If fibrinogen level is low will replace with cryoprecipitate.  If D-dimer is elevated barely confirms diagnosis of possible vaccine related thrombosis.  The fact the patient is not thrombocytopenic at this time is encouraging, however despite the lack of thrombocytopenia she still has clearly documented symptomatic nonocclusive and occlusive thrombus in her cerebral sinus.   From UPtoDate.com Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, also referred to as the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine) ? On April 13, 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended pausing administration of AD26.COV2.S  to further investigate rare cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and thrombocytopenia [33]. As of that date, six cases had been reported, all in females aged 18 to 48 years with onset 6 to 13 days after vaccination; during this period, 6.8 million doses were administered (with 1.5 million doses in females of that age range) [121-123]. Since some vaccine recipients have not been followed for longer than the time frame over which these symptoms develop, the incidence may change with additional follow-up. Initial symptoms included headache, backache, chills, and fatigue, and progressed to focal neurologic deficits. Intracerebral hemorrhage and thromboses at other sites were also seen in some patients. All of the five patients who were tested for the anti-PF4 HIT antibody tested positive. Another case, in a young male who was a vaccine recipient in one of the pre-emergency use authorization efficacy trials, had been previously reported. These cases appear similar to those reported following ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222, another adenovirus-vector vaccine. Although rare, the observed number of events exceeded the expected rate among females &lt;50 years old. Given the extreme rarity of these events, the FDA and CDC acknowledge that they recommended the pause out of an abundance of caution and to ensure awareness of these rare events.    ?Evaluation and management of possible thrombotic complications ? Recipients should be aware of the possible association and seek immediate care for signs and symptoms suggestive of thrombocytopenia (eg, new petechiae or bruising) or thrombotic complications (including shortness of breath, chest pain, lower extremity edema, persistent severe abdominal pain, unabating severe headache, severe backache, new focal neurologic symptoms, and seizures) [117]. In such cases, some experts suggest evaluation with complete blood count and differential (including the platelet count), quantitative D-dimer, HIT testing, and imaging of any suspected site of thrombosis [113,114,125]. Onset 4 to 20 days after vaccination, platelet count &lt;150,000/microL, elevated D-dimer, and a positive anti-PF4 antibody (HIT antibody) suggest the diagnosis. Treatment with a non-heparin/non-warfarin anticoagulant (eg, argatroban or direct oral anticoagulant) and intravenous immune globulin has been suggested. The CDC recommends not using heparin in individuals with thromboses following receipt of Ad26.COV2.S unless HIT testing is negative [126]. (See &#34;Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&#34; and &#34;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&#34;, section on &#39;Terminology and HIT variants&#39; and &#34;Management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&#34;, section on &#39;Role of IVIG&#39;.)   As stated above all the 6 cases were &#34;all in females aged 18 to 48 years with onset 6 to 13 days after vaccination&#34; this would certainly fit the timeframe that we are seeing in this case.  Recommendations from national guidelines would be to start treatment with dexamethasone immediately while awaiting intravenous gammaglobulin.  To pursue intravenous gammaglobulin treatment at 1 g/kg over 1 to 2 days.  It is recommended to avoid heparin and instead use direct factor X inhibitor such as Eliquis, which this patient is already been started on.     There is unfortunately considerable risk that even though patient&#39;s symptoms appear mild at this time, that she may deteriorate in the very near future and I would recommend treating her aggressively at this time with dexamethasone and intravenous gammaglobulin while we are awaiting further testing.  Patient clearly has had unusual thrombosis, especially in a 27-year-old.     With the fact that she had headache dating back to January, it is impossible to determine the acute versus chronic nature of her venous sinus thrombosis. Covid infection does cause increase in coagulation as well.  However, given the small risk of tragic outcome with cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis in the setting of Covid vaccinations, we will proceed aggressively with treatment starting tonight with intravenous gammaglobulin and intravenous dexamethasone.     Will require rapid fasting glucoses to evaluate possible hyperglycemia from high-dose dexamethasone.  Will consider stopping dexamethasone at 48 hours.  Current recommendation for gammaglobulin would be single 1 g/kg or 500 mg/kg over 2 days.  No recommendations for treatment beyond this point.  Current recommendations for gammaglobulin dosing would recommend using an adjusted dose for patients with greater than 125% of their ideal body weight.  This patient at 122 kg on a 5 foot 2 inch frame does qualify for adjusted dose and her orders reflect that.   I appreciate the opportunity see this patient this evening and consultation requested by Dr.  We will follow patient in hospital.  Hopefully she will have gradual improvement and avoid any serious or tragic complications of her cerebral sinus thrombosis.     We will have pharmacy report possible adverse reaction to Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine to the FDA as required by law.   April 17, 2021 follow up. No new events.  Laboratory studies remained excellent.  White blood count is further elevated, however, this may be secondary to high-dose dexamethasone with a white blood count of 16,060.  Hemoglobin 14.0 g hematocrit 42.8%, MCV 86.8, RDW 12.9%.  Platelet count is actually increased slightly at 374 as of 9:10 AM this morning.  Differential shows left shift as expected with dexamethasone.  Results from yesterday showed fibrinogen normal at 369 (180?415) pro time normal at 10.4 seconds with INR of 0.97, PTT 26.7.  D-dimer 0.23 (0.19?0.50).  With platelet count, fibrinogen and D-dimer normal I am inclined to believe that this is not an acute post vaccination HIT-like phenomena.  If it were I would still expect to see some degree of thrombocytopenia elevated D-dimer and perhaps low fibrinogen.  The other explanations for her cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are either idiopathic spontaneous and merely coincidentally associated at the exact same time as her Covid infection or more likely, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis secondary to hypercoagulable state secondary to her Covid infection from December 2020.  Unfortunatly there is no way to accurately date the acuity of the venous thrombosis in her cerebral sinus.  HIT Testing is still pending and most likely will not be available for 3-4 more days despite being ordered stat.  Have called the laboratory and asked them to check with our outside reference lab what the expected return time is on this test. (LabCorp says &#34;Tuesday April 20, 2021).  Patient refused intravenous gammaglobulin infusion which has been ordered last night.  Patient has been receiving dexamethasone which was a bridge until intravenous gammaglobulin could be administered.  Current guidance from the expert hematology panel (EHP) on Covid vaccine induced thrombosis dated April 7, 2021 from the  public health would state that a patient who has a reduced platelet count without thrombosis with a D-dimer normal and normal fibrinogen or thrombosis with a normal platelet count and D-dimer normal and normal fibrinogen are &#34;unlikely cases&#34;.  They recommend for probable cases who have D-dimers that are elevated to send HIT assay and then give immediate intravenous gammaglobulin while awaiting results.  They recommend fibrinogen supplementation, if needed.  They recommend a direct acting antithrombin agents such as the Eliquis this patient is receiving.  They recommend steroids particularly if there is a delay in getting intravenous gammaglobulin delivered.  With the fact that we now have 24 hours in the hospital with no evidence of thrombocytopenia, no evidence of increased fibrinolytic activity or active thrombosis, and no evidence of hypofibrinogenemia, I would argue that her presentation is subacute.  In this setting, I do not feel intravenous gammaglobulin would be necessary and does involve a small risk as well as considerable cost.  Dexamethasone also involves small risk and negligible cost. I have discontinued both of these medications.  My overall impression would be that this was not related to her Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination which was recent, but rather her more distant Covid infection.  It is impossible to definitively answer the question however.  The next question is duration of anticoagulation.  Risk of recurrent cerebral sinus venous thrombosis is relatively small but the morbidity can be high.  Studies have been performed showing medications in the same class as Eliquis have been associated with a decrease in incidence of the recurrence.  Most hematologist recommend 3 months of anticoagulation for provoked venous thrombosis including cerebral sinus venous thrombosis.  I feel this patient&#39;s thrombosis is &#34;provoked&#34;, with her association at the same time of her Covid infection (and possibly vaccination).  I would recommend Eliquis (apixaban) 5 mg twice daily or Xarelto (rivaroxaban) 20 mg daily with food. I would feel comfortable in discharging patient for outpatient follow up IF Dr and other speciality services agree. Plan 3 months of full dose anticoagulation with direct factor X inhibitor.   Circulation 2010 Jun 29;121(25):2740-6 &#34;Long-term evaluation of the risk of recurrence after cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis&#34;, Background: The clinical course of cerebral sinus-venous thrombosis (CSVT) is largely unknown because prospective studies with a long follow-up and with the goal to assess thrombosis recurrence rate and predisposing factors for recurrence are lacking. Methods and results: One hundred forty-five patients with a first CSVT were followed up for a median of 6 years after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment. End points were recurrent CSVT or other clinical manifestations of venous thromboembolism. CSVT recurred in 5 patients (3%) and other manifestations of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism) were seen in 10 additional patients (7%), for a recurrence rate of 2.03 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 1.16 to 3.14) for all manifestations of venous thromboembolism and 0.53 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 1.10) for CSVT. Nearly half of the recurrences occurred within the first year after discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy. Risk factors for recurrent venous thrombosis were male sex (adjusted hazard ratio, 9.66; 95% confidence interval, 2.86 to 32.7) and, for thromboses other than CSVT, severe thrombophilia resulting from antithrombin, protein C, protein S deficiency, anti-phospholipid antibodies, or combined abnormalities (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.34 to 16.5). Conclusions: The risk of recurrent CSVT is low and is higher in the first year after discontinuation of anticoagulant treatment and among men. Mild thrombophilia abnormalities are not associated with recurrent CSVT, but severe thrombophilia entails an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs or pulmonary embolism.   April 19, 2021 Follow up, no change in condition. Discussed case with Dr, will order Factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, anti phospholipid and anti cardiolipin antibodies, if she will allow draw. Expect Heparin Induced Thrombosis testing result tomorrow, but with no thrombocytopenia after given heparin, expect will be normal. Will await result. If discharged, would recommend 3 months direct thrombin inhibitor (Eliquis/Xarelto/Pradaxa) at full anticoagulation dose. Then stop, no taper. Overall still feel &#34;provoked&#34; thrombosis due to December Covid, unrelated to J&amp;J Covid vaccine, but can not definitively prove that..

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine, my left arm and left side of my neck and back became very sore and I felt very light headed and dizzy. 7 hours later, the back pain worsened and I started sweating a lot. Soon after my skin all over my body began to tingle as if I had bugs crawling all over my body and it was very uncomfortable. During the night I couldn&#39;t sleep because I was sweating so much, the back pain was getting worse and worse, and the tingly skin feeling turned into very intense skin sensitivity and hurt any time my body touched something or rubbed against my clothing. At some points I would be extremely hot and sweating a lot and then some points I was freezing cold and shaking uncontrollably. These signs all lasted 24 hours and slowly started going away after 48 hours. After 48 hours, I felt much better and back to &#34;normal&#34; but couldn&#39;t help but notice some strange reactions that I still have today, 3 weeks later... I have had acne which is uncommon for me. I have had period cramps and mood swings but am not on my period. I also have had crazy bloating in my stomach and all over my body... swollen legs, feet, hands, etc. I also have been experiencing brain fog where I loose my train of thought in conversation, I can&#39;t remember where I put things, I can&#39;t remember if I took my eye contacts out or not, or fed the dog... very strange and uncharacteristic of me to be so aloof and forgetful but to the point where I have zero recollection of doing such activities.

She received her first COVID vaccine 8 hours prior. No cough. She felt well before the shot. No bleeding or leaking fluid. Her COVID test was negative. She was tachycardic to the 140&#39;s and the baby was tachycardiac to the 180&#39;s starting at presentation. She was treated with oral tylenol and IV fluids. After about 90 minutes of monitoring a prolonged fetal heart rate deceleration was noted to the 60&#39;s for 6 minutes. This recovered with repositioning. After another hour a reactive tracing was noted with a normal heartrate for baby. In induction of labor was started.

                                                I received the shot on Saturday, March 6th. Flu-like symptoms developed 12 hours after (aches, chills, extreme fatigue) and lasted about 12 hours -- pain in left arm lasted a full five days. On Thursday March 11th I started to develop a cold sore on my chin which was followed by malaise and swollen glands. I treated it with Zovirax. On Wednesday March 17th I developed what looked to be a pimple in the middle of my left eyelid. There was a small white/ fluid filled head about the size of a pin head. Over the next three days, three more fluid-like blisters the size of a pin-head began to develop on upper eyelid. By Tuesday March 23rd, I had over half a dozen fluid filled blisters that were painful and began to crust. The blisters extended from upper eyelid to below the brow (only on left side of face). On Tuesday March 23rd I went to the eye doctor. The eye doctor had asked if I ever had shingles (I have had the chicken pox vaccine, but never had chicken pox nor shingles). I have had HSV-1 since childhood and get the yearly cold-sore when stressed or immunity is low, but I never have had cold sores appear anywhere else other than lip/chin area. The doctor had suspected the eye blisters were a form of herpes and prescribed me 14 days of Valacyclovir. The blisters only affected the skin-- not the cornea or inside eye. Within a day and a half of the antivirals medication, the blisters were fully crusted over and started to clear up.

Patient was sent for US doppler which left cephalic vein thrombus detected on duplex US. Was treated with aspirin and had follow up doppler of UE for follow up on LUE cephalic vein thrombosis-negative 5/13/21.

Two days later I started feeling my throat swollen I had my lymph node swollen on my neck &amp; under the jaw line everything was on the left side as the vaccine. It started to become very painful 6 days later I went to the urgent care and they gave me antibiotics to treat it. It was a 2 week treatment once I finished it about 5 days later I had to go again because it started to happen again I went in to get more. Now a couple a weeks ago its starting again but I have not gone to the urgent care anymore I&#39;m just watching it and hoping it goes away. If it does get worst then I will be going again.

                                                I began to feel bad 6 hours after the application of the vaccine with chills, stiffness, muscle and body pain. I already imagined that the fever was starting. 3 hours later I got home and took my temperature, it was 101 F.   the fever lasted more than 15 hours. I didn?t  take any medication. I put cold cloths on my head, bathed and rested. the headache was very intense. So far I have discomfort from that but the fever has already stopped. The most striking thing was the allergic reaction that I began to have around midnight and it continued until today. they were hives all over the body. swelling and itching and redness. Finally after 24hs after vaccine I took an anti allergy called levocetirizine  cause itching won?t stop.

My blood pressure was fine as well. The doctor on site gave me Advil, Zyrtec, and an H2 Blocker. After about ten minutes my face felt back to normal. They monitored me for about an hour and checked my blood pressure again twice and then I was free to go.

                                                In ED on 3/11 0246 with the following Chief complaint - I got the johnson and johnson covid vaccine 3/10 at 4pm and now I can&#39;t stop throwing up&#34;  c/o emesis, fever, body aches.  HR 140s. pt is A/O x3. &#43; nasuea, chills fever 101.2. denies throat swelling or SOB. pt presents with swelling at vaccine site and rash to both shoulder blades She does feel lightheaded and dizzy.  Denies any recent illnesses.  Denies any prior intolerance to vaccines. Fever 101.7F Patient has low-grade fever but nontoxic-appearing.   Blood work shows mild leukocytosis with left shift likely reactive otherwise within normal limits.   After 3 L of IV fluids she remains persistently tachycardic in the high 130s to 140s. Additional information for Item 18:  She states she was feeling fine prior to her vaccine, denies any recent illness, sick contacts, recent travel, CP, SOB, abd pain, dysuria. After eating and drinking patient states she feels a little nauseous and having some indigestion so was given some more Zofran and Maalox.   She continues to be presenting tachycardic in the 130s.   Given the rest of the reassuring ED work-up I think this is likely autoimmune response to the vaccine however given her current heart rate I cannot discharge her safely.   Will admit her to medicine team for observation.   SIRS, likely 2/2 vaccine - hold off on antibiotics for now without clear source of infection, procalcitonin negative - tylenol prn for fever   Principal Problem:   SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) Active Problems:   Tachycardia   Asthma  3/12 discharge summary She was given 3L IVF bolus in the ED -- still tachycardic in the 110s, fever has improved.  There was concern for adverse reaction to vaccine and she was given prednisone 60 mg x 1 in the ED.  Her symptoms have improved and she is able to tolerate PO without vomiting.  Of note, she says her entire family had a respiratory viral illness approx 1 year ago which her PCP suspected was COVID 19, but were unable to be tested at the time.     Fever has resolved, has been afebrile x24 hours, leukocytosis has resolved   tachycardia has improved although still HR in the 110&#39;s with ambulation, ordered an echo however patient did not want to stay wanted to follow-up with PCP and have this done there.   Vital signs have been stable, patient states back to her baseline and feeling great.  Would like to go home.

                                                Around 5:30 pm in the evening following my vaccine I started having chills, headache, nausea, and fever of 101. Chills got worse, whole body was shaking and shivering. Nausea progressed into constant dry heaving. Head was pounding with the worst pain I have ever felt in my life, worse than natural child birth and worse than running marathons. The nausea was so bad and I could feel my fever burning and getting worse. I was about to vomit so got out of bed to go to the toilet to vomit and the whole room started spinning completely out of control. My heart was racing and I could hear it and feel it pounding rapidly through my ears. I couldn?t walk and was so disoriented I crawled to the bathroom to throw up in the toilet. My husband heard me and came and picked me up off the bathroom floor and carried me to our bed. As the night progressed fever got worse, head was in almost unbearable pain, severe body aches over my whole body, heart racing and horrible nausea and dry heaving.  I made it through the night. For two days after I had a headache and fever  and nausea and body aches and couldn?t get out of bed to care for my children. By the third and fourth day I was able to get out of bed at times and still felt fatigue, nausea, headache and body aches. Anytime I would stand up for 10 days after the vaccine it felt like I was rocking on a boat. I am almost at 2 weeks and still feel fatigue and dizziness at times. On April 15th, 9 days after my vaccination I had symptoms of a blood clot in my leg. I went to the Emergency Room and was diagnosed with a superficial blood clot of the leg as well as swelling in the vein. I am thankful to be alive!

                                                About 24 hours later, I noticed a rash the size of quarter. On Tuesday, the rash was bigger and it was swollen underneath - the lump underneath it was the size of a golf ball. Wednesday and Thursday - Nurse measured it had rash top was 7 cm and the lump underneath was the size of my palm (much bigger). It was really painful and really itchy.  On Thursday, I did a telehealth video chat - and I showed it to the doctor and that&#39;s when I went to the clinic where the nurse measured it. Treatment was given: Steroid cream - called Triamcinolone. I used it that night and by the next day the redness had gone down 50% and the lump decrease, also. I have been using it twice a day since Thursday. Today the redness is gone and the lump is maybe the size of a quarter.  It&#39;s about 90% better but not completely gone.

I wasn&#39;t able to get up and my arm swelled up really bad.  I was having streak in my vison and really bad dey eyes and mouth.  I had a fever on going for about 3 weeks straight. I called my Doctor the following day and she said it was a normal reaction, if it get&#39;s worse to call her again. I called her again because it got worse, my neck got swollen. left arm was trembling, lymph nodes were swollen, leg leg was pulsating. I started having chills and hot flashes ( I still have some till this day). My Doctor recommended seeing a specialist- Neurologist, Infectious Disease Dr.  The Neurologist said he can see where I get the trembles but does not  want to put me on medication and see if it goes away on it&#39;s own. I have a follow up with him regarding trembles, headache, flashing in my eyes. The Infectious Disease Dr. I&#39;m following up her her again regarding my arm swelling, they prescribed me steroids but had not gone down.  Since all of this I have been very fatigue, this is everyday.

I typically have a high threshold for pain, No change on Sunday. Monday the back of right knee stated aching, sensitivity in left thigh. Both muscles on outside of legs felt like I had done a workout and needed stretched, On the 13th the aching traveled from the back of knees to calves I went to the Hospital.

Swelling did not respond to Benadryl. No other allergy symptoms (hives elsewhere, etc.) - Filing this report on Day 16 after vaccine and, while swelling has improved, itching persists and I still have a walnut-sized mass of firm tissue under skin near injection site and patch of redness/discoloration on deltoid. Have been checked by doctor who ensured that reaction is indeed dermatological allergic reaction (not infection).

Second day after shot arm got a knot at the Injection site  and started to turn red, get hot, and swollen.  Red spot grew in size for 5 days. Took benadryl and the heat and inflammation went away in 2 days. Lump/knot is still the same size as day 2 on day 9. Ice packs didn&#39;t help. Dr is having me rub the knot and apply heat as much as possible along with taking over the counter anti-inflammatory. Lymph nodes behind ears have now swollen.

On April 9,2021, I noticed swelling and tightness in my left leg, on April 13,2021 I noticed severe swelling in my right leg too. I met with my primary care physician who sent me for imaging which confirmed clotting. I was referred to the Emergency Room since my INR was 3.7 but I was still clotting. I was sent home with out treatment from Medical Center because I was therapeutic on my warfarin. On Friday April 14, I went to the ER after speaking with a hematologist at the facility. I was admitted and was put on fondaparinux.

She received her vaccine around 2:00 p.m. She began developing itchiness in her palms/soles of feet and scalp that quickly developed into a a welt like rash about 3-1/2 hours after receiving the vaccine while on a walk with her husband; this was shortly followed by facial swelling over her right eye.  They made it home and she got in a cold shower to cool down, became dizzy, started seeing spots and had difficulty breathing. Her husband called EMS and she was hypotensive when they arrived.  She was given 2 doses of epinephrine (0.2 mg each per ED note) and a dose of Benadryl which helped. Shortly after the 2nd dose, she began having difficulty swallowing, maintaining the ability to breathe through her nose. She was given a 3rd dose of epinephrine and transferred to the ED; during transport an IV was started with an epinephrine drip. She was seen at Emergency Department; she was given IV fluids, solu medrol, tryptase level and had a normal EKG.  She was discharged with an epi pen prescription. Tryptase is still pending at the time of her visit. She started a new prenatal vitamin at 11 am 4/28/21. Otherwise, she reports no new foods, medications or topical products. She did eat before going on a walk, pepper jack cheese, wheat thins, and black bean hummus. She is pretty sure she was not stung by a bee prior to onset of symptoms yesterday.   Interestingly she reports recent urticarial episodes that occurred in February of 2021. These occurred when she was visiting her in-laws and occurred in the middle of the night, 2 nights in a row during the middle of her visit.  She has never had hives previously.  She reports no family history of hives or anaphylaxis.  She reports no use of new topical products or medications.

After receiving my vaccine 3/19/21 i started to feel tingling in my feet around 4/30/2019 that made my feet hurt to walk on. The tingling than started to turn into a numbness at the tips of my toes and traveled throughout the rest of my feet making then feel hard to walk on. After about a week the numbness started to travel up my legs causing a decreased sensation on my legs where i started to feel tingling  sensations. Once it was almost to my knee and had already been to two doctors that werent sure of a diagnosis i went to the er where they were able to diagnose and treat me.

Foot and legs cramps at night, swollen red toes.  Around 6/1/21 toes on both feet became extremely red and painful, as well as the pads of my feet (hot to the touch). Walking and driving became painful and difficult. Nothing could be touching my toes/feet because of the severe pain. Random Jots would go from my feet up through my body. Sleeping became impossible because of the pain. 6/7/21 contacted a Dr. prescribed me METHYLPREDNISOLONE 4 MG DOSEPK. This had no affects to the pain swelling went down in toes. I then scheduled an appointment with a podiatrist 6/21/21. She prescribed another METHYLPREDNISOLONE 4 MG DOSEPK. Followed back up and feet were more red. She advised me to get labs done. Later that day I had acupuncture to treat toes. next two appointments for acupuncture 6/24/21, 6/28/21. Pins in needles were gone other than my feet, toes, right fingers. As of now my left foot /toes are not as painful. Numbness/pins&amp;needles. Right toes and pad of foot are still numb with pins&amp;needles.

                                                Received injection on the R arm. However, injection was administered very close to the shoulder instead of the deltoid muscle. Area is very swollen and it has not decreased in swelling in several days despite applying ice, taking ibuprorfen, and also applying heat. There is also a knot. I massaged the area to try to loosen the knot. However, I noticed it gets more swollen instead of getting better. The pain subsides momentarily. However, it returns. It is affecting my range of motion, I cannot lift my arm above my head as it causes extreme pain.

                                                On the first day, I had fever, chills, aches and pains , and a head ache.  Second day- swollen lymph nodes under the arm, aches and pains,.  Third day - head ache  and muscle fatigue   5th day- starting at 4am. I woke up with skin itching. I noticed a rash on my arm where injection was. It then spread to back, other arm, legs, neck , ankles and knees. Took Benadryl and Zyrtec by doctors orders. The rash went away- but then six hours later returned and has grown. I also have to take more Benadryl since the same amount has not helped the rash disappear.

The only thing different in my body was the Janssen Vaccine. Midway through my IV I started itching, numbness in my fingers, lips, and feet. My face was on fire and my tongue was swelling and I could feel my throat closing. My arms turned red and blotchy and swelled. My nurse stopped the Benlysta and started Benadryl and a saline flush. The symptoms then went away.

                                                I received the Janssen vaccine on 4/8/21 at 12:00 pm.  By 5:00 pm that day I began having flu-like symptoms (fatigue, body aches, nausea).  These symptoms carried through to the next day (4/9/21).  When I woke up at 6:00 am on 4/10/21 I had a rash on the backs of my upper arms and the front of my thighs.  As the day went on, the rash progressed to cover my entire body.  I went to the ER around 2 pm where I received a steroid injection and was prescribed oral steroids.  I was fatigued for the next two days, but was able to return to work on 4/12/21.  The rash began subsiding, but overall lasted 2-3 weeks.    I completed my seven day prescription of oral steroids on 4/17/21.  On 4/18/21 I was very fatigued.  On 4/19/21 and 4/20/21 I was extremely fatigued and unable to get out of bed, sit up, or stand up.  On 4/23/21 I woke up at 7:00 am with a swollen face, throat, tongue and lips.  I returned to the ER where they prescribed me another round of steroids, but a lower dose and a longer duration.  I experienced fatigue for 6 weeks after receiving the vaccine.

I first noticed a lymph node  on right side of my neck within 2 days of the vaccine. I had a swollen lymph node on the right side of my neck - I can feel it - it was about the size of nickel and round. I went to see my doctor and they want me to go get an ultrasound. That happens this next week. It&#39;s about the size of a pea now. I have had a in person visit with doctor and televisit.

                                                Had all side effects within 24 hours of vaccine- went to bed with a headache and chills, had body aches and slight nausea the next day. Then it all went away aside from some lingering arm pain.  A few days after the shot I had tingling and numbness in all 4 limbs. I also had random sharp pains in my right leg. I woke up Friday morning and my right arm felt like ice cold water was dripping down (but wasn?t). My husband took my blood pressure and it was really high and my chest felt tight. Given that the vaccine was just paused for blood clots we went to the ER. They ran labs and said I didn?t have any clots.  Here is the timeline of what happened after:  Saturday &amp; Sunday &amp; Monday: Felt normal again  Tuesday: Felt short of breath  Tingles started to come back  Wednesday: Leg and arm numbness   Thursday thru the next few days were the worst:  Thursday: Random sharp pains, back, thigh, ab  Right calf felt a bit swollen and more sensitive  Tingling on back of head Tingling in leg and arm  High anxiety pain in chest  No appetite High blood pressure   Friday: Muscle twitching in thigh, sides and random places  Random tightness/sharp pain in thigh  Blood pressure and heart rate went back to normal  High anxiety pain in chest before bed  Didn?t sleep well keep panicking awake (not normal) No appetite   Saturday: Right calf slightly swollen after walking around  Still had muscle twitches and it?s always in the same spot in my thigh   Did a teledoc appt which was totally unhelpful  High anxiety pain in chest- felt like I was going to pass out at one point and we took my blood pressure in that moment and it was high ?happened after dinner No appetite  Note: anxiety is not something I?ve ever had   Sunday: Swelling in leg returned Sharp pains randomly A little heavy to breath at times  Tension in my head ? felt cold After I ate dinner chest heaviness returned Sensory overload- watching tv couldn?t do. Sound of humidifier plus tv  gave me major anxiety. Turned humidifier off and it  instantly got better  No appetite   Next few days Leg feels numb tingly in morning  Slightly tingling in my right hand Light headache  Some random twitches and sharp pains in thigh still  The next month all seemed fine. It wasn?t until I got a small cold that the tingling flared up again. Right leg continues to be a problem-tingling and numbness comes and goes daily. I?ve also had a few episodes of chest tightness out of the blue.  Last night I woke up to find my right arm also tingly and numb.

I assumed it was from looking at my phone while I waited for the 15 minute wait to be up, but the pain never stopped, but it did move around my body. Fever every evening starting the day after the shot. Searing muscular pain since shot, worsens when fever happens, and the pain is moving throughout my body. On Monday, It is day 3 after the shot and my arm is swelling more today than any other day. Advil 400mg every 4 hours, rest, and plenty of fluids.

Got very clammy and sweaty and weak - immediately left the store and started projectile vomiting outside the store and all night the first night. Had extremely joint/bone pain throughout my entire body for 4 days straight in bed, very weak, chills and night sweats, day 2 I had a little energy and drove about an hour and immediately started vomiting again  for day 2-day 5. Day 5 I woke up with swollen eye lids and hands and thought it was an allergic reaction to something in my house so took benedryl, but didn?t help. The swelling went down on day 6. I?ve had no energy and very foggy brain and been very down. My chest has felt like an anxiety attack 24/7 all week. I am on day 10 since the vaccination and my chest pain has increased. I still have foggy brain and been very out of it and weak still. I vomited day 1-day 5. Really bad pain in my hips and arm where I received the shot.

                                                patient was treated with the Janssen/Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 adenovirus vaccine on Saturday April 10, 2021 and she relates having had symptomatic problems since that time stating prior to administration of the vaccine she was in her normal state of health.  She relates that on the evening of April 10 she had chills but otherwise no other major symptoms and the next day felt fine as well as during that week.  However she states that starting 1 week later on Saturday, April 17 she began feeling poorly characterized by a recurrence of hives that she has had in the past along with a sore throat.  She states this occurred while she was at work and describes the sore throat as unusual from prior sore throat she has had in the past with a description of a globus-like sensation along with some difficulties swallowing for more pressure than overt pain.  She attempted salt water gargles without benefit.  The rash was the characteristic hives rash that she has had on 2 prior occasions with rapid development of itchy red lesions scattered throughout especially in her proximal extremities and torso region.  She relates the hives worsened on Sunday, April 18 essentially from &#34;head to toe&#34; although not actually involving her face.  She also related new accompanying symptoms including diffuse arthralgias, stiffness and swollen painful muscles and joints.  This was throughout her entire body and somewhat of a migratory nature involving all of her major joints including the hands, wrists, shoulders, feet, ankles, knees and hips.  She states that because of the severity of symptoms she had an urgent care appointment on Sunday, April 18 and felt to have a exacerbation of urticaria for which she was prescribed montelukast, loratadine cimetidine and a Solu-Medrol Dosepak.  She states she was unable to fill the Solu-Medrol Dosepak initially but took the other medications without relief and then presented to the emergency room here at Hospital on Monday, April 19 where she had an evaluation which was largely unremarkable other than laboratory testing with a nonspecific elevation in inflammatory markers including a CRP of 5.7, ESR 34 and white blood count 15.92.  She was notably COVID-19 negative at that time as well as Monospot negative.  She was discharged home and ended up filling the Solu-Medrol Dosepak which she took and noted some improvement in her hives but has been continue to experience this ongoing sore throat, arthralgias, myalgias and diffuse swelling which is quite painful.  She specifically relates &#34;every time I use a muscle it seems to inflame.&#34;

                                                patient admitted 4/23 for a multitude of symptoms and signs suggestive of a multisystem autoimmune inflammatory disorder of unclear etiology. Her past medical history is relevant for mild intermittent asthma, history of recurrent idiopathic urticaria, history of migraine headaches, hypothyroidism on supplemental levothyroxine, history of bipolar affective disorder on antipsychotropic medications (lamotrigine) and ADHD on stimulant medication (Focalin).  Notably, the patient received a Johnson and Johnson COVID19 vaccine on 4/10. She reports current symptom onset on 4/17. Symptoms include pleuritic type chest pain, myalgias, arthralgias, diffuse interstitial edema, urticaria and objectively evidence of diffuse inflammation manifested by rising leukocytosis 16,000, CRP 9.3 from 5.7 just days ago, ESR 71 from 34 just several days ago, and new acute hepatitis. Pt admitted to the hospital and hospitalist states &#34;Unclear etiology definitively but the clinical features all developed approximately 1 week after administration of the Janssen/Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 adenovirus vaccine which raises suspicion for this vaccine setting off the disease process&#34; and &#34;Strongly recommend consideration for reporting of possible adverse reaction to the Johnson Johnson vaccine&#34;.

                                                My top and bottom lips developed blisters on Friday afternoon and by Saturday they began to weep. They them became crusty and swollen. Over the next few days they continued to weep. They stopped weeping and were crusty, and then the crust came off on the Wednesday after it began. My lips were still sore and sensitive, but were back to normal about 10 days later. Doctor prescribed an antiviral (vircyclovir) for cold sore but I don&#39;t think it was a cold sore. I actually did develop a cold sore on my bottom lip 2 weeks after the initial lip issue.

                                                Around 7 pm on the night the vaccine was administered (5/14/21), I noticed my legs felt heavier and weird. When I looked at my legs, they were swollen and slightly red. This did concern me, but given that I can not afford health insurance, I laid in bed with my legs elevated and eventually went to sleep. When I woke up the next day around 9 am, my legs were no longer swollen, but my hands now were. The swelling went away by 5 pm that day(5/15/2021). Thus far, besides a headache that persisted for three days straight from 5/21/21 until 5/24/21, I haven?t experienced any other abnormal swelling and I currently feel fine today.

I washed my hands added lotion to them and went back to bed. I was okay when I woke up in the morning.

The injection site of the vaccine was hot to the touch.  I have a history with severe food and medical reactions and know what my body feels like when it is about to go into anaphyisis so I immediately took 3 Benadryl.  During this time my body tempature rose from 97.8 to 98.6.  After an hour, the symptoms passed.

Instead of beginning to wane, my period started to get extremely heavy and I started passing clots again about 24hr after the injection. On the night of 4/12 I passed an unusually large clot, roughly the size of a hockey puck and felt very faint and weak. I continued to bleed quite heavily until this morning (4/19), for a total of 14 days. I called my obgyn on Tuesday of last week to report the excessive bleeding and that my cervical lymph nodes had become so swollen that it was bothersome to swallow. My Dr said to go to ER if I experienced typical blood clot/PE symptoms and had received no guidance about the effects of this vaccine on menstruation.  I have had mild headaches, sore throat, mild fevers and fatigue as well since the injection

They prescribed sulfameth/trimethoprim 800/160mg 2x a day which didn&#39;t help anything and I went back 2 days later. The abscess had swollen to golf ball size. I also had swelling at injection site, hot, red, &amp; painful. Doxycycline 100mg. That started helping but the arm was still painful. Hidradenitis suppurativa was the diagnosis. Dermatologist says that it was caused by a autoimmune response. Armpit was injected with a steriod/lidacaine injection. I had to have wound treatment. Clindamycin lotion, 1% to help would site clean. The issue was the injection site area that took 2 weeks to resolve. It was hard, red, raised and hot. They were not sure if it was an allergy or infection. I also felt like I was in a brain fog during this.

I was tested and a Deep Vein Thrombosis in my right leg. The swelling was in my left leg. There is no redness or swelling in that leg. I am taking subcutaneous injection of Lovenox 0.8 ml twice daily.  I was 27 weeks pregnant at the time.  I am currently experiencing injection site pain and I am seeing a maternal Fetal Medicine Specialist monthly. A birth plan has to made for when I deliver because of the medication.

                                                I got Johnson &amp; Johnson ?Janssen? on May 3. For reference, I have moderate to severe ME/CFS and vestibular migraine. I had COVID in December, was bedridden for two months, and almost recovered to baseline before the jab. Here?s my V timeline:  Day 1: May 3   Several mins after J&amp;J: Huge hot flash and vertigo spin that went away immediately   30 mins after: Felt drunk  Rest of evening: Extra sleepy  Day 2-3:  Extra dizziness and fatigue, mostly in bed. Definitely felt like I was fighting something.  Day 4: Vertigo attack.  Days 5-11: Felt better than I had since before having COVID! Less dizziness, more energy. My post-Covid symptoms such as orthostasis had greatly improved.? My resting heart rate was sometimes in the 70s!?  Day 12: ADVERSE EVENT: I felt like I got COVID all over again, but less severe. Nevertheless, my feeling of breathlessness was enough to send me to urgent care. I also had chest pain/heaviness, extra dizziness, and increased heart rate (117 resting). EKG at urgent care showed abnormalities similar to EKG I had in December when I first had Covid. So, I ended up in the emergency room. No clot or heart blockage. Doctor seemed to think either I was having a delayed reaction to the vaccine, or this was somehow Covid related.???  Day 13: Woke up feeling better until I had breakfast and had to poop. After doing that, I got so exhausted I landed back in bed all afternoon. This was another problem I had during Covid.? At least my resting heart rate was more normal, 98.  Day 14: ??Vertigo kicks in on top of everything else. Xanax is the only thing that helps my vertigo so I took that and was in bed all day.  Day 15: Didn?t sleep well but a little better.  Day 16: Chest pain and breathlessness are worse again. They got worse after I took a shower upon waking up.???  Day 51 (Today, 6/22/21): Chest pain and breathlessness are much better. Still have extra dizziness. Resting heart rate is usually between 88-100 now. Orthostasis has improved but not gone.

My ears were swollen also developed redness, rash on my chest. I ordered Benadryl through delivery for what looked like hives to me. On 06-14-2021 I also developed new allergies that I did not have. My face swelled up and went numb, had tingling sensation to my hands. I went to see my PCP who referred me to an allergist doctor. I also had an allergic reaction to a skin care product that I use. I went to HCF to see a doctor who performed a physical exam. The doctor at the HCF felt my breasts which are so tender to touch, the doctor also could feel the swelling of my lymph nodes in my breasts and also my menstrual cycle is 6 days early this month. To this day the swelling in my lymph nodes are still present and painful. I still continue with fatigue, nausea as before but now I feel its more constant. I do not have my lot# to provide.

She reports feeling well when she developed scalp itching which progressed to diffuse intermittent hives and angioedema 2 days after receiving Covid J&amp;J vaccination. She has been taking oral steroids, antihistames and h2 blocker for weeks. She reports no improvement in symptoms with these interventions. She also reports itching, but this has progressed to burning and stinging skin. She notes her palms and soles have been sore, and have purplish blotches. Evaluation in the ER was non revealing for a cause but as the patient has been so miserable, admission was recommended for IV treatment. Currently she is standing in her room,

                                                Starting about a week after vaccination started to see unexplained bruising on extremities, then a few days later (about a week and a half after vaccination) an unexplained spontaneous hematoma appeared on right arm (vaccination was given in left arm). The hematoma grew to about 3 inches in diameter, pain and swelling associated.  Later that evening stiff neck and sharp in point headache appeared. The headache would last maybe around 10-45 seconds and then would dissipate. Headaches were sharp and frequent but did seem to resolve overnight.

Still have the rash and itches off and on. Cannot wash hands with warm/hot water because it burns, Part of my hand felt slightly swollen yesterday and skin is sensitive, feels chapped.

                                                I was taking a shower the night of 04/28/21 and I had a bad pain in my right leg. It felt like it could be a blood clot. The area was swollen and I was in a lot of pain. My blood pressure started getting high and it kept going up. On the way to the hospital, I started getting a headache and shortness of breath. I tried to elevate my leg on the way there. I took an aspirin. I had to sit in the waiting room for 2 1/2 hours and my pain in my leg and headache continued. Once I was taken back, they ran a few tests. I was told that my D-Dimer was elevated which indicates a blood clot. I was checked for a pulmonary embolism and that was negative. I was given a blood thinner because an ultrasound technician was not on duty. I went home at 4 am. I went back for an ultrasound the next day for my entire leg. Everything came back normal. The pain slowly went away.

                                                I had flu like symptoms for 24 hours afterwards. My arm swelled up from shoulder to elbow. I had a bright red rash that started to go away and then came back and got worse over two weeks. I have a half dollar size lump at the injection site that showed up 24 hours after the vaccine - hard like bone. Not hard like a muscle knot or something. Hot to touch  - the whole rash area and itching. I went to  Urgent care  on the 21st -after it didn&#39;t go away in two weeks. They prescribed Cephalexin to take 1000 mg twice  a day for a week. The rash is mostly gone and heat is gone but lump is still there.  And followed up on Sunday 29th. The doctor said that the hard lump might be permanent. Doctor said the rash part looked like Cellulitis. Rash and fever are gone but lump is still there.

I went out to my car and over the next few minutes - I was getting hotter - My face was extremely hot and flushed, and hives started developing on my arms and chest. They were burning and itching; my skin was hot to the touch. My chest felt tight and my throat felt swollen, but I was able to breathe (breathe felt a little short, but I was able to take a full breathe). I was also dizzy and felt nauseous. I went to the ER, where they treated me for anaphylaxis with Benadryl, Pepcid, Breathing treatment, and a steroid. After about an hour or so I felt fine, and the dr gave me some medications to take over the next few days.

                                                8:00am. Sunday, april 11th woke up with extremely sore neck on the right side. It became visibly swollen over the day and unable to turn my head without extreme pain. The lymph node in the area is extremely tender and warm to the touch. Around 5:30 a rash started occuring on the neck where it is swollen.  All of this is occuring on the opposite side of where the injection was given.  No other side effects have been noticed through out the days after the injection until today.

Patient states redness was approximately 2 inches around the injection site, patient states it is warm/hot to the touch and swollen. As of today 4/13/21 level of redness, swelling have been stable and she called us as she expected symptoms would have resolved by now and because she has an underlying swelling condition that may confound level of swelling.  Patient referred to contact primary care provider or seek treatment at walk-in clinic/urgent care for evaluation. Presently unaware if patient has followed recommendation and sought evaluation by healthcare provider, but expect that provider to complete their own VAERs or the patient will follow up with the pharmacy and we will submit a new form with those dates and outcomes.

There were no visible sores, but some redness and maybe a slight swelling. I treated with some OTC items (kanka, peroxdyl) and it subsided a few days later. Then about a week ago, symptoms returned and I had a telehealth visit with my Primary Care doctor on 4/9. She prescribed Acyclovir and recommended Vitamin B12 complex, in addition to using aquaphor to assist with the dry lips. She did not indicate that it was the vaccine, but did not rule it out, so I wanted to report the reaction. While this has helped, it has still not fully improved, and I will be seeing my allergist on 4/19 for a follow up as that was her recommendation if it didn&#39;t go away.

She did not give specific dates, but we are over 2 weeks from date shot given, and over 1 week from when she claims to have swelling, and she called today after hearing about clots in news. I advised her to go the the emergency room as soon as she could, just in case this is a case of clotting or any other issue that would cause this swelling.

Patient was prescribed Fioricet (butalbital/acetaminophen/caffeine). 2021-04-05 - patient developed right-sided neck pain 2021-04-06 - patient got tested for COVID-19, resulted negative on 2021-04-07 2021-04-08 - patient seen at Medical Center emergency department for headache and right-sided neck pain that shoots to (2021-04-08 cont.) the head and shoulder, for which patient self-medicated with ibuprofen. Patient reported to ED provider that using ibuprofen nearly relieves headache and makes her functional and had the most improvement the day she visited the ED prior to her visit. Patient received a CT scan of the head without contrast that was unremarkable. Patient was diagnosed with headache and neck sprain and was prescribed ibuprofen 600 mg, take 1 tablet by mouth every 8 hours, and diazepam 5 mg, take 1 tablet by mouth 3 times a day as needed for muscle spasm. 2021-04-12 - patient developed left lower extremity pain 2021-04-14 - patient followed up with Neurologist outpatient as directed by ED provider and was advised to get an MRV and left lower extremity doppler. Patient was prescribed tramadol 50 mg and butalbital/acetaminophen/caffeine (Fioricet) by the Neurologist. 2021-04-15 - patient presented to Medical Center ED before outpatient MRV and LLE doppler could be done due to worsening right-sided neck pain and inability to ambulate comfortably due to lower extremity pain that had been worsening over several days. Upon examination, there is subtle swelling to left lower extremity and doppler revealed multiple DVTs in left lower extremity. CT head without contrast was unremarkable, however, CT venogram of the brain reveals thrombi of the right transverse sinus and sigmoid sinuses, as well as IJ. Patient was initiated on argatroban and admitted to inpatient at the time of this report. &#34;Heparin induced platelet antibody&#34; and &#34;lupus anticoagulant evaluation&#34; tests are ordered and pending.

Given liquid oral steroids at urgent care and prescription called in for prednisone and hydroxyzine to be started the next day on 4/17.  Hives did not go away at all, able to sleep until about 5:30am 4/17 and woke to worse itching and hives spread even worse, all over legs, hips, arms stomach back and neck.  Pharmacy not open until 10am 4/17, to pick up new prescriptions, so was not able to take the hydroxyzine and  prednisone until 11:15am today, 4/17, which was 1 hour ago, still extremely red, itchy, swollen hives all over as of right now.  Will give the medicine more time to work before going to emergency room, since my breathing has been fine.

The male nurse even looked at the needle. After the 1st 24 hours after shot i had a mild fever and tired. After 2nd day after receiving vaccine my arm  was very swollen and red.  Its been almost 2 weeks and  i still have a small knot at the injection site.  I occasionally feel a sharp pain in my arm from time to time.

Three weeks after my vaccination, my shot site began to hurt and then I started to exhibit an allergic reaction to foods I had never been allergic to previously. First it was ground turkey, and then two days later, I had an allergic reaction (hives, itchy mouth, and anaphylaxis) to chicken. A few days later I developed the same reaction to beef, and now I have the same reaction to berries and vegetables. My body seems to be attacking everything I eat.

                                                On Friday I woke up with swelling around both eyes and in my forehead. Swelling increased progressively so that by Sunday my left eye was nearly swollen shut. I saw a nurse practitioner on Monday and she gave me some steroid eye drops. This helped reduce inflammation a little bit but the swelling and redness continues. The skin was stretched, red, thin, itchy, and crusty. It has now been 15 days since my vaccine. The worst of the swelling has subsided but my eyelid and the area under my eye are still puffy, itchy, and red.  I am concerned based on the area of the reaction that this was related to an adverse interaction between the vaccine and dermal fillers I had Injected in February of 2020.   In addition to this reaction I had extreme fever, shakes, lethargy, and random superficial bruising. The bruising appeared in places where I had had no injuries 6-9 days after the vaccine and looked similar to those you see on people who do cupping - not round but like tiny red dots with pooled blood à stippled bruise with no pain.

I was given Pepcid, Benadryl and an Epi. I was released after a few hours and I went home and slept for two days. The guy that gave me the shot must have hit a bone and I was in pain for weeks. I am still experiencing some issues from it. My doctor has me stretching every morning due to my shoulder feeling tight. She says it could be a nerve issue.

                                                I started experiencing skin rash in face and flushing about two weeks after the vaccine about three times and had to take a Benadryl each time for the reaction even while being on Zyrtec on a regular basis. I started having under eye puffiness and body rashes right after these reactions that didn&#39;t go away even with regular allergy medication. I then started having a reaction similar to a nut allergy even though I ate something I made at home that had no nuts. I had some swelling on the right side of my face and eye. I also had some minor lip swelling and itching along with throat tightness. I had to take a Benadryl as well with this reaction. I have experienced episodes of this type everyday after eating or just in general and I&#39;m on a high histamine regimen as prescribed by the doctor. I was placed on steroids Prednisone for three days with no results after that. I have episodes where I feel my throat swelled and tightness along with itchy swelled lips, nasal pressure and itchy body.  I&#39;m still taking the his histamines as prescribed and Benadryl when the bad reactions occur. I have a epi pen.

She developed pain and stiffness in her neck which spread to her back and generalized muscles to the point where she had difficulty moving in the next 12 hours.  She did not have difficulty swallowing but she did have difficulty chewing and complained of throat pain.  Upon arrival to the emergency room she was unable to lift her legs to get out of the car.  In the emergency room she was found to have a CK of 130,000 along with a creatinine of 1.1 and potassium of 6.8 with a calcium of 7.0.  She was admitted to the hospital ward and given aggressive IVFs. The following am she was having trouble breathing and was started on BIPAP; the repeat CK level climbed to 543,500.  She continued to worsen, developing increased swelling around the mouth and neck.  She became anuric with acute kidney injury; and was subsequently transferred to CCC upon which she was intubated and initiated on CRRT.

I went to dr who advised I was having an allergic reaction and told me to take benedryl I had a 2in by 2inch hive under my skin at my time of visit which had gone down a little because of benedryl and it was extremely painful even 9 days out. I experienced extreme confusion and mental fog from Sunday all the way to Wednesday where I felt confused, and was having some rapid breathing.

                                                Starting about 6 hours after administration I developed a headache and low grade fever around 100.1. I was ill that night and still feeling tired the following day and feverish. My left knee, which I had previously had a lateral meniscus transplant with a cadaver graft, starting swelling up and becoming increasingly uncomfortable. By Wednesday the 17th, I could barely put weight on the leg and the pain level had increased to 6/10, with 10 being the worst pain. This knee had previously been on a positive healing trajectory since my surgery. By Wednesday night, I couldnt put weight on it and pulled out the crutches to walk (I had been off of them since early February). I was dealing with a family emergency so did not have the capacity to deal with it at the time. Thursday morning, the 18th, all of my joints started becoming painful. I chalked this up to vaccine reaction. I was still fatigued and the knee was still extremely sensitive and couldn&#39;t bear weight. Friday and Friday night my joints became visible swollen and were so painful I was crying trying to find a comfortable sleeping position. I couldn&#39;t put any pressure on my shoulders for sleeping, the neck was stiff and tight, my hands and feet were visibly swollen with fluid and I couldnt even lift a cup due to the painful, enlarged finger joints. Every joint in my body seemed effected. Saturday morning I called my doctor who determined it was due to the vaccine and it seemed my immune system was attacking my joints. I was prescribed 40mg of predinsone in a 8 day taper. By 24 hours, the pain had receeded to a normal level of ache and I could put some pressure on my left leg again. By 48 hours after starting steroids, the swelling was reduced and I started to feel more normal. I have no history of autoimmune disorders or previous rhematoid issues.

Sharp pain/radiating heat feeling in left arm at injection site, subsided after a few hours.  Pain/cramping in right lower abdomen/stomach, subsided within 24 hours.    two weeks post vaccine:  slight pain and swelling in right foot.  Many of these are symptoms I experience leading up to and during menstruation as well, which occurred in the week after vaccine.

Those symptoms lasted about 24 hours and, by midday Wednesday, she was back to her baseline of intermittent dry cough, shortness of breath, and no smell or taste.  It wasn&#39;t until Sunday, two days ago, that she developed sharp, pinpoint right superior parietal scalp pain that, after a few doses of OTC Aleve, did somewhat improve.  Other than two 220 mg OTC Aleve tabs twice daily, she has not been taking anything else for her symptoms other than prescribed asthma/allergy meds. She states that her shortness of breath has been helped from the use of albuterol as needed.  Unfortunately, the Aleve has not helped with her chest pain, which she describes as a &#34;constant ache.&#34;  Initially, patient had some pleurisy, but that has apparently cleared up.     No history of CVT, PE, and she does not smoke or take oral contraceptives.

On 4/19/21 I noticed I have a large swollen spot on the right side of my neck. I am currently taking antibiotics to see if it is a bacterial infection. The doctor and pharmacist think this could be a swollen lymph node after getting the Covid vaccine.

                                                1. Received J&amp;J shot in Left Deltoid- told ahead of time &#34;People say it burns&#34;. It did burn incredibly bad--unlike any shot I have ever had-it burned like the time I had knee injection. I assumed this was &#34;normal&#34; for COVID.  My arm ached/hurt to move shoulder -could tell it was painful/stiff driving back again, I knew many were having &#34;reactions&#34; so I presumed this normal--thinking ROM issue/pain was &#34;normal&#39; despite my whole arm feeling such.  By 1800 that evening, my entire arm was throbbing, and starting swelling-although right handed--could see entire arm bigger than other. I wasn&#39;t able to sleep/get arm in comfortable position.  I thought this was a normal reaction-had patients to see-but touching/moving my arm hurt as bad as time I torn my meniscus.  Over next several days, swelling went down--I could painfully move my arm, but it was weak-unable to function as usual. I still thought this was normal and struggled through week as April 4-9 was Spring break.  I had trouble even leaning forward on bike because should STILL hurt--and it tapped on shoulder it would hurt incredible bad/couldn&#39;t carry daughter. Since I have higher pain tolerance- I was able to push through-however, by following week, this was no longer working--arm started swelling again.  I felt the injection was high and was talking with my mom whom  in primary care NP, and she mentioned shoulder injuries could happen if injection given too high--which is when I realized that my shoulder pain was not &#34;all in my head&#34;.  S/p vaccination day 19 forward, it has seemed to flare as bad as initial day one and not gone back.   This is when I looked up and discovered there was also a condition called &#34;SHOULDER INJURY RELATED TO VACCINATION&#34; that described exact symptoms I had.     It also mentioned that damage isn&#39;t necessary should from needle--- although it was a year ago-- I had probable COVID April 2020---which could have made my immune system hyper-reactive.      I have had to call out sick April 16th because shoulder was causing pain, flushing and warm feeling.   April 19th I saw Dr-- he drew blood (I don&#39;t know what)-- didn&#39;t do full shoulder exam and referred to orthpedicc.  APril 30th I ended up calling out again as when arm would swell it made focusing at work very difficult. I saw my PCP via telehealth and she prescribed Prednisdone dose pack.   May 2nd, I  started treatment with cryotherapy machine and this was only thing that relieved pain and swelling enough to help relieve pressure.      May 7th---I saw Dr.-unfortunately, he didn&#39;t do anything because he stated a vaccine couldn&#39;t cause such type of damage to rotator cuff, didn&#39;t believe there was a condition called SIRVA and declined to treat with cortisone shot &#34;This whole thing started with a shot-that would be inappropriate&#34; .  He was willing to refer me to Physical therapy whom HAS heard of condition and knows how to rehab

I went to ER on 04-09-2021 where they examined my neck and they told me that my lymph nodes are swollen and the ER doctor told me that that was a reaction to my vaccine and that it would go away in a few days. I can say that before the vaccine I did not have my lymph nodes enlarged. To this day I still feel the lump on my neck. The ER doctor did not give me any medications.

                                                About a week after being vaccinated I started experiencing bad headaches, chest pains and pains in my leg. I went to the emergency department at Hospital to get checked out. They took blood and I had a high d dimer test result. They did an Ultrasound of both legs, and a CT with contrast of the lungs and a CT of the head. No blood clots were evident at the time. Over the next couple of weeks my left leg has continued to swell and hold fluid. On 5-11-2021 I had another ultrasound of the left leg again to rule out a possible blood clot. Again they did not find anything. After reviewing blood work from a coag profile all results were elevated but not worrisome per the dr. I continie to have more swelling in the left lower extremity, muscle aches and pains in that leg along with more busted blood vessels. I have experienced pains in places that I have never had before. Example a sharp pain started around my left pelvic area and shot up to the left shoulder and then burned for several minutes.

                                                The day after, I woke up with a bad headache and I had the headache for a good 19 days. The doctors thought I was over-reacting. It was a bad headache on left side of head. I was just not feeling well. On the 19th day, it went away. I still from time to time I do still feel pain in the head on the left side. I had a lot of tightness in my left leg. In  previous years, I have had blood clot in my leg and after birth in my stomachs - so with the pain in calf I called a doctor and went. They did a visual. After a lump appearing in my leg, an ultrasound was scheduled. I went  Urgent care on May 10 - she ordered an ultrasound but her office didn&#39;t ever follow up with me. On 17th, I saw my Primary care and she sent me straight to get an Ultrasound - on the 18th, it revealed I had a blood clot.

                                                Shortly after the vaccine on the drive home the injection site got super hot, the arm began to swell and turn red.  I developed a fever and my sinuses got really stuffy.  I began to throw up profusely which made all symptoms from other issues occur causing me to swell all over and because I couldnt take any meds or keep anything down I went to the ER.   While there I began wheezing and experiencing SOB which still is an issue today.  I have foggy moments where my brain seems so foggy that I am having issues with my short term memory.  I was administered IV fluids, IV morphine and IV ibuphropen to help with the symptoms and was hospitalized for less than a day further evaluation

                                                3 mild reactions to report.  1 - A little over 24 hours after vaccine, my ankles were extremely swollen.  I elevated over the next 24 hours frequently an swelling went away.  2 - On Friday, March 26, swollen glands under my left armpit (shot received in left arm), swelling is completely gone as of 3/29.  3 - the evening of 3/28/21 I became itchy on my scalp, arms and back.  I have showered and applied lotion and have not introduced anything new to my routine which is why I believe it may be shot related and worth mentioning.  The intensity is mild but if it persists or worsens I will contact my doctor.

I woke up with a severe headache. My resting heart rate went up into the 100&#39;s. I had a knot on top of my forehead, like a swollen area. It lasted for a few days. My feet and fingers started turning blue. I am still experiencing fatigue, feeling lethargic and my resting heart rate is still high. I have received medicine from my Cardiologist.

                                                The evening after getting the vaccine I had intense vertigo, nauseau and headache.  These symptoms continued for a week and then I went to an urgent care to be checked on April 17th.  The doctor thought it could be swimmer&#39;s ear and prescribed ear drops for 10 days.  Over the course of the 10 days the vertigo lessened and headache went away but ear pain, swollen glands and swelling under ears remained.  Ear pressure, popping/crackling when yawning/swallowing, ear pain and a feeling of fullness in the ear with muffled hearing continued.  I went back to the doctor May 17th and was put on amoxicillin for assumed ear infection.  Symptoms did not resolve after antibiotics, except that hearing was less muffled.  It tooks weeks to see an ENT who checked my hearing and checked for fluid in the ears, both are normal but ear pain/pressure remains along with itch sensation in ears, ENT thinks inflammation from vaccine and prescribed steroids.
