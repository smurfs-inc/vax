The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included asthma (as a child), non-alcoholic, and cigarettes smoker. The patient experienced drug allergy when treated with Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate).  The patient received Covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: unknown, expiry: unknown, NDC number: 59676-0580-15) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 14-MAY-2021 at 10:00 for prophylactic vaccination on left arm. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.

It was further reported that he could not breath, his lips and face started to swell and then he passed out. The patient was taken to ER (emergency room) and his doctor gave him EpiPen (epinephrine) shot, Medrol (methylprednisolone), Benadryl (diphenhydramine hydrochloride) and IV (intravenous) fluids. The patient&#39;s lips were drooping to the right side of his face even after taking the medications. The patient stayed at the ER for 6 or 7 hours then was sent back to home on the same day. On 15-APR-2021 (reported as Saturday), the patient had fever.

                                                At roughly 6 days after vaccination my body developed Hives head to toe. Roughly 18 or so hours after initial hive development I sought treatment for a anaphylactic reaction in my throat and face area. I received a steroid and a Pepcid to calm it down, and was given an epi pen and sent on my way. The following now two plus weeks since then I&#39;ve had episodes of dizziness, shortness of breath and headaches that seem to be constant. There has been almost no relief from these symptoms, however the rash has completely resided. I&#39;ve taken an Aspirin in the mornings to deal with the headaches but strenuous activity seems to bring these on much more prominently.

                                                Thursday 4/8: 3:20pm: COVID injection given in right arm  Friday 4/9: ~1:00 am: woke up shaking with chills and severely cold; had slight headache. Had insomnia all night.   6:00 am: woke up with bad headache, slight fever.   7:00 am: got out of bed and had vertigo and was running into walls trying to walk to my living room, along with the worst migraine I?ve ever had. Also had dizziness, nausea,  chills, 100&#43;degree fever, aches, skin sensitive to touch, and severe tinnitus. All of the veins were visibly popping out of my head.   As the day went on, everything got worse. Any time I moved, my head would throb so bad that I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital.   3:45 pm:  the headache started to finally go away. It would only hurt if I moved fast. At this point my fever was only slightly high, about 99 degrees. I was still unstable when I walked and dizzy. I went from being super cold, to being super hot and sweaty. And I was alternating between cold &amp; hot and sweaty for the rest of the night. Was also having some memory issues, repeating things when I was having a conversation with someone over the phone.   I was sweating all night when I was sleeping.   Saturday 4/10: 7:00am: woke up with a slight headache; still out of it and dizzy.   8:00am: after being awake for about an hour or so, I looked in the mirror and my whole face (around the lips, cheeks, and jawline, and under the eyes) was really swollen and puffy. My face was even mis-colored. Under my eyes was purple and yellow, and my cheeks were white.   Some confusion persisted throughout the day as well as dizziness.
