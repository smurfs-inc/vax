                                                Symtoms were first noticed on Tuesday June 8th about two oclock in the afternoon when I noticed a slight burning sensation on my right shoulder. I had presumed this to be sunburn. The next day I noticed a few blisters and additional discomfort and subsequently applied OTC lotion. As the days progressed it looked as though it was poison-ivy as opposed to sunburn. Again applied OTC medications to relieve the pain. By Monday, June 14th, the situation had progressed in severity, necessitating a visit to the emergency room. I was examened by DR. who diagnoeded the problem as &#39;shingles&#39;, not poison-ivy. He subsequetly dianosed taking ValACYclovir for seven-days then recommended that I follow-up with a Primary Care Provider in seven-days. The valACHclovir helped stop the spread of the problem, but did&#39;t do much to relieve the discomfort. The following Tuesday, June 22nd I met with Dr. of the Health Clinic adjacent to the hospital. After vitals were all taken, we had a question and answer session where it was determined that nothing else could be done for Me except for the shingles to &#39;run their course&#39;. Retuning home I continued to administer OTC lotions and sprays to help reduce some of the burning sensations experienced around the face, ear, neck, and shoulder which was becoming more severe. After several days of not being able to sleep or get any relief from the &#39;burning and stinging&#39;, I decided it was necessary to get a second opinion. I then notified another hospital, that I would be arriving for an examination that afternoon, July 12th. at approximately 2pm. Upon arrival and completion of completion of all vital signs by medical staff, I was met with a doctor. Upon examination and understanding the symptoms experienced, she prescribed &#39;Gabapentin&#39; to help reduce the &#39;burning sensations&#39; and &#39;Prednisone&#39; to help reduce the &#39;skin rash and swelling&#39;. Returning home and starting the prescribed meds, I did notice some immediate relief from the Gabapentin, which for the first time in more than a week or so, I was able to get a nights sleep. I didn&#39;t notice any changes taking the prednisone and had to presume that it helped stop the spead of the rash from going further.   As I prepare this overview, it is now July 18th and once again experiencing severe pain and tighening of muscles around the face, neck and shoulder. Pain feels like &#39;stinging needles&#39;, &#39;miniture electical shocks&#39; that course thru from above the ear, down thru the face neck and over to the chin-throat&#39; area. Pain lasts but a brief second, but very painfull, making sleep impossible. Touching any area on the right side of my body from the scalp, across the face and neck down to my shoulder, back and collar bone result in extreme &#39;burning sensations&#39;. I have a 12:45 pm appointmet at the hospital on Tuesday July 20th to meet with Dr. who will become my Primary Care Provider. I can only hope that we&#39;re able to come-up with some solution that will easy the severity of the &#39;stinging sensations and burning&#39; that will allow me to sleep and get beck to resuming nornal activity.  Up until this event, I had been an actrive, healthy, 78yo man who had never been sick nor been to a Dr. in over 20 years, which I contribute to the clean, healthy environment here. In summary, it is my firm belief that in view of recent media reports about the Guillian-Barr symtoms which affect the nerves and muscles, it is the result of having received the Johnson&amp;Johnson vaccine that contributed to the onset of my developing shingles. Because I had not had the Shingles vaccine at any time, it might be advisable for those that are beyond a certain age who have not had the shingles vaccine NOT get the Johnson&amp;Johnson vaccine if other alternatives are available.

Daughters noticed he was having progressive difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, and generalized weakness. O2 sats were also noted to be lower than normal with pulse oximeter at home (92% compared to baseline of 95%). On day of admission patient had a mechanical fall while carrying a tray with his walker.  Hypoxic to 88% on arrival. Labs notable for leukocytosis (13.68), hyponatremia to 127 and negative infectious workup. CTH with chronic microvascular changes and global atrophy but negative for acute process. He was admitted and continued on prednisone 5mg daily (outpatient regimen). Patient was started on a three day course of IVIG on 5/3/21 due to concern for myasthenia exacerbation with subsequent improvement.

This started out mild and as the week went on got worse.  Symptoms were leg swelling, shortness of breath, persistent stomach pain, headache, and chestpain.  On 6/24 at 3:30 am he went to the ER where they discovered a large (golf ball size) blood clot in his right lung.  He also has been diagnosed with pancreatitis.  We have talked to five different doctors and multiple other hospital staff who all say it is a direct impact of the covid vaccine.

He also reported extreme acid reflux symptoms whenever he attempted to drink any fluids at that time as well as nausea.  This progressed to difficulty breathing at which time the caregiver was alerted and checked his blood pressure.  This reading was 88/55 according to the caregiver and the pulse was very high as well but the actual number could not be remembered.  The difficulty breathing prompted them to alert emergency medical services where he was picked up and transported to the emergency room via ambulance shortly after for evaluation.

The patient had not recovered from swollen legs and feet, pain in forearms, worsened guillain barre syndrome, and falling and imbalance. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This spontaneous report received from a consumer concerns an 87-year-old male, with concurrent Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) who was reported to have &#34;worsened&#34; GBS after an unspecified duration of receiving the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine.  The worsening was described as falling and had imbalance; swelling of hands and feet; pain in forearms.  No treatment reported; the events have not resolved.  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  Based on the information available, and the clinical picture of concurrent GBS could represent the normal progression of the illness. However, a relationship with Janssen Covid-19 vaccine cannot be ruled out and thus the relationship is considered indeterminate.
