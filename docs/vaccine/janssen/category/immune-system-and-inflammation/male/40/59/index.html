                                                About seven (7) days post vaccine injection I began to experience pain and numbness in both arms, numbness and swelling in my lips and face area and a feeling of indigestion/heartburn.  I presented to urgent care and subsequently the emergency room on 03.27.2021 with those symptoms and was treated and released.  The following day, the symptoms continued, specifically the pain and numbness in the bi-lateral arms and additionally began to experience pain in the chest area and increased resting heart rate (125&#43; bpm).  Again presented to emergency room on 03.28.2021, treated and released.

There were scattered faint ground-glass opacities along the right upper lobe as well as left upper lobe.  COVID-19 testing was added on after results.  At this time I do not have a great explanation for the patient&#39;s hematuria.  I did instructed to follow up with Urology for further evaluation of this.

Went to the ER and was diagnosed with Bells Palsy.  ER doctor also performed CT scan which was normal.  Was given prednisone and valacyclovir, instructed to protect and dress my eye.  The right side of my neck under my ear is very swollen and tender.  I have pain in the back of my neck on the right side.  I had a follow up with PCP 5/05/21.  She told me to use an eye ointment.  It has been two weeks and my face is still paralyzed.  Some of the swelling has gone down in my check.

                                                Pt. received the vaccine at approximately 2:44pm.  Before I could hand him his card, his hands began trembling and he looked pale.  I asked how he was feeling.  He reported feeling shaky, dizzy, and very hot.  I asked him if he was having any difficulty breathing, had tightness in his throat/airways, or even felt a tingle.  He said no.  Noting the time, I asked if he had eaten lunch.  I asked if he has ever felt this way before.  He said he had when he gets a &#34;hypoglycemic attack.&#34;  While not diabetic nor on any medications, he said he will occasionally get very low blood sugar.  He said he had not eaten since early that morning.  Another employee brought some juice I requested.  I again asked him about symptoms related to anaphylaxis, to which was not an indication of an anaphylactic reaction.  I gave him the juice to sip.  I asked him again about symptoms.  Because he was still dizzy, I took his blood pressure/heart rate.  His BP was 160/119 and heart rate 96bpm.  His color became more gray over the next several minutes.  He was still too dizzy to stand, felt hot, shaky, and now nauseous.  He handed over the juice and was given a receptacle if he vomited.  We suspected a vasovagal response, but was still symptomatic after 10 minutes. Meanwhile, the other pharmacist tried to call his doctor&#39;s office.  We learned his doctor had moved away and he had not yet come in nor selected a new provider.   We asked him if he felt he needed to be seen by a doctor.  He said he did and agreed to us calling an ambulance.   The ambulance arrived around 3:10.  The EMTs took his BP.  It had come down, but he could not stand up without his knees buckling.  The EMTs got him on the stretcher and took him to the hospital.

After patient returned home, his partner reports considerable swelling on his left arm, continued hallucinations and trying to dismiss her concerns.

                                                Ten days after vaccination I had an allergic shellfish reaction to a frozen lobster product.  Never happened before and I&#39;ve had other Lobster on the east coast before.  I also ate shrimp a few days prior to vaccination with no reaction.  I have eaten other Lobster all my life with no reaction.    My sinuses and throat closed up making it very difficult to breathe.   I didn&#39;t know what was happening so I took decongestants and antihistamines then went to the doctor and got injected with a steroid immune suppressor.  I now have epinephrine just in case it happens again.

                                                On 4/14/2021, right elbow started to hurt.  This was a site of a removed gout-caused mass over a year ago.  That subsided within a day.  On 4/15/2021, left foot started to hurt.  By 4/17/2021, the next to smallest toe and the large toe was swollen and very tender to any sort of touch.  It was not warm.  The pain was almost unbearable on 4/18/2021 and the suspicion that it might be gout was considered.  On 4/19/2021, after a visit with his doctor, gout was confirmed as the likely cause of the pain/swelling.  However, no blood tests were run to confirm.  Treatment for gout was initiated.

                                                Swollen lymph nodes and abdominal pain from right him bone down to scrotum. Pain on 4/7 was such that i though i was suffering a hernia.  Couldn&#39;t get out of car or move my right leg across my body. Could put right leg into pants leg.  Hurt to bend over and do much of anything on 4/7.   Initially thought pain was in testicle but doesn&#39;t hurt at all to the touch.  Realized it more a swollen area in the groin between hip bone and scrotum.   Nothing hurts to the touch at all in that area either which lead my to believe it was swollen lymph nodes.  The  Feeling is as if i got hit in the right groin  and my testicle has been hit and discomfort is 8 inches above right testicle in my groin area.    It has been improving every day since then, the more i walk the better it is.  It only hurts when i sit now and it seems to aggravate it pretty well but once i start moving the pain goes away.  It has been 9 days now and the i don&#39;t notice it all day until i come back to the office and sit at my desk and again it gets aggravated and the discomfort feels like my right testicle is near my appendix  Since this all started my legs feel heavier in the calf and have little nerve sensations when i sit too, which concerns me about the blood clot possibility and so i have been emailing with my doctor.  I am going to make appt for Monday 4/19

After going to the chiropractor two times the knot and pain ended up in my right leg. I then went to Urgent Care where they diagnosed me with a large blood clot. They sent me to imaging and after scanning the area confirmed that there was a blood clot in my right leg. Urgent Care then set me up with a specialist.

He reported that he is going to go back to the hospital, to which he would seek medical attention if he was having issues. Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included paracetamol. When called back due to his vaccination dates being after event start dates, the patient said that his memory is not too good, so he &#39;had to take his time to remember the correct dates&#39;.

The patient was recovering from blood clot in leg, and had not recovered from runny nose, shortness of breath, heart rate increased, chills, feeling hot, gangrene in toe, right leg swollen, and right foot swollen. This report was serious (caused hospitalization).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 50-year-old  hypertensive and diabetic male patient reported that he was feeling hot and may need to have his fifth toe amputated because it has gangrene 4 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and 2 days after discharge form the hospital.  The patient was hospitalized for shortness of breath, heart rate increased, runny nose, and chills 28 days prior to vaccination.  The patient went to the emergency room 2 days prior to vaccination because his toenails/skin on his toes were coming off, swelling in his right foot and up his leg, gangrene in his toe; he reported that there was no circulation going to his toe and was diagnosed with having a blood clot in his right leg; the patient reported he had surgery to &#34;open up&#34; the arteries in his leg. Four days after vaccination, the patient felt hot and reported reported that he may need to have his right pinky (fifth) toe amputated because it has gangrene.  The patient is taking paracetamol as treatment.  No other details was reported.  Based on the lack of temporal association, the causality is considered not related for the events blood clot in leg, shortness of breath, heart rate increased, right leg swelling, right foot swelling, chills, and runny nose.  The information available regarding event gangrent of fifth toe and feeling hot precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

He was transferred to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a flesh eating bacteria in the right leg where the pain was at and Sepsis.  He was taken to surgery to debride the right leg and was started on CVVHD because his new kidney was now failing, he eventually was started back on Hemodialysis and taken to surgery 2 more times where he cardiac arrested on the table in surgery and died.  A private autopsy is being performed but the preliminary results shows he had multi-system organ failure, including his liver which was NEVER a problem in the past.

                                                Patient initially presented with meningitis-like syndrome with altered mentation, fever, headache, neck stiffness and found to have multifocal brain (predominantly brainstem lesions).  He was initially started on empiric meningitis coverage (ceftriaxone, vanc, ampicillin, acyclovir) which was stopped when CSF tests/cultures returned negative and he improved. Around 10 days later he then developed Guillain-Barre syndrome with ascending weakness of legs and inflammation of cauda equina nerve roots and inflammatory involvement of spinal cord as well causing weakness, numbness, autonomic dysfunction (cardiac arrhythmias) and urinary retention. He was treated with 5 day course of IVIG and improved enough to go to acute rehab. Diagnosis was ultimately concluded as atypical Bickerstaff&#39;s encephalitis or idiopathic inflammation of the brain, spinal cord and nerve roots without no other causative event identified other than recent vaccination

We requested him to stay in observation for 30 minutes after vaccine administration. He agreed and vaccine was administered. After working  approximately 3 hours later he returned to the pharmacy stating he felt out of breath. He didn&#39;t know if it was because of vaccine or CHF. Questioning him further, he said he felt a little swollen around neck. He was responsive. Administered 50mg of Benadryl. Instructed him to sit. He had a portable fan. After sitting down, he started to feel better. He remained at the pharmacy and called for transportation home, leaving approximately 1 hour later

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination I started to experience chronic exhaustion, leg cramping and pain in my lower back right side, upper right thigh, behind my right knee and down into my right calf. I figured that the pain would go away but the pain increased and my leg started swelling and the pain increased making it very difficult for me to put my leg down on the ground and put pressure on my right leg.

Next morning pain, swelling and nausea persisted. Medium intensity body aches and headache began late morning. By mid afternoon body pain increased to the point that I was no longer able to function and needed to lie down.  Took a 4 hour nap. Side effects persisted after waking up.  At time of writing, 28hrs after vaccine, I am still feeling the side effect although less severe. Ibuprofen and Tylenol  do seem to help.

                                                1 week after receiving the vaccine, what I believe to be a gout flare started in my right foot.  The joint of my big toe became very swollen and red, painful to the touch and the rest of the front part of my foot also became swollen.  It was difficult to walk or even put pressure on it for 5 days and I treated it with ice, elevation and 600 mg ibuprofen 3X/day.  Symptoms are starting to resolve , but the joint is still swollen and red, though the pain is subsiding.  I am able to walk with a normal gait, though there is still stiffness and some pain.

                                                After the injection on Friday 03/12 at 1:50 PM at facility, I started to get a slight temperature, Along with chills as well. This continue throughout the weekend. I remained at home and did not have any energy to go out and be around people. The next day, I also got diarrhea and was very dehydrated.  Immediately, after I left the vaccine shot location, like within 5 minutes, I started to smell fish and my mouth tasted like salt for three days. I also had excruciating headaches that did not go away with advil. So I rested a  lot and had no real big appetite what so ever!.  Today, I am concerned that on my left side below my left clavicle, I feel a big bump what appears to be possibly a lymphatic swelling of node? I am concerned because I did not have this swelling before and do not know if it&#39;s a reaction to the vaccine.  Pls contact me via phone, this is urgent.  Thanks

My leg was swollen from the knee down and my ankle was very swollen. My Eliquis dosage has been increased from 2.5mg to 5mg twice daily. I did not have a repeat sonogram but my leg is no longer swollen.
