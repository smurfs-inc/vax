There were scattered faint ground-glass opacities along the right upper lobe as well as left upper lobe.  COVID-19 testing was added on after results.  At this time I do not have a great explanation for the patient&#39;s hematuria.  I did instructed to follow up with Urology for further evaluation of this.

                                                11 days following the single shot I developed severe pain in my right calf muscle that felt like a charlie horse and on my leg from knee to my ankle felt a squeezing sensation like I was wearing a very tight sock that I couldn&#39;t take off.  After a few days the pain subsided and the similar pain began in my left leg however not as severe.  The pain would seemingly move around and come and go.  Some days it was so bad I couldn&#39;t walk or balance.  I believed I had a muscular issue.  I then began having swelling on the top of my left foot and around the ankle of my left foot.  After about a week, my right leg began to swell from the knee to ankle fairly significantly.  New veins appeared on the front of my right leg and other veins on the back of my right leg began to bulge.   Pain on both legs started to subside on the evening of 5/23, however swelling continued.   On the evening of 5/25 I was experiencing severe squeezing sensation and bulging veins in my right leg.

                                                GUILLIAN BARRE; This spontaneous report was received from a consumer (the patient&#39;s wife) and concerned a 42 year old male. The patient&#39;s weight was 170 pounds and his height was 76 inches. The patient was a non-smoker, a non-drinker, had no known allergies and no prior or underlying medical history or past medications. The patient received COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number reported as unknown), dose not reported administered once in total to the left arm on 12-MAY-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. The batch number was not reported and has been requested. No concomitant medications were reported.  On 12-MAY-2021 (same day post-vaccination), the patient felt tired, but felt better on the second day (13-MAY-2021). On 14-MAY-2021, two days post vaccination, the patient went to work (works as a landscaper) where he fell over and twisted his ankle. This happened again later during the day and after a few days, he felt that his feet were not picking up (like Frankenstein syndrome). Patient could not move his toes and his feet felt sloppy like a drop foot. After 2 weeks, on 26-MAY-2021, the patient started experiencing tingling and numbness in his arms and had to wake up in the middle of the night to shake his arm. The patient&#39;s physician referred him to a neurologist, the neurologist thought that it could be a case of transverse myelitis and asked him to go to the emergency room (ER) immediately. At the ER, all his tests were run such as x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), coronavirus disease (COVID-19) test, together with unspecified blood work and neurological tests, the results of which were not provided. The patient was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre syndrome and was hospitalized on 04-JUN-2021 where he was being treated with immunoglobulins (product unspecified) and was discharged on 08-JUN-2021 (duration of hospitalization: 5 days). On 17-JUN-2021 in the morning, patient fell in his garage. At the time of reporting, patient couldn&#39;t lift his toes. Patient was perfectly healthy prior to the shot. Patient was getting mentally affected as everything felt like labor and work seemed burdensome. At the time of the report, all his symptoms were ongoing. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from Guillain-Barre syndrome. This report was serious (caused/prolonged hospitalization). This case, from the same reporter is linked to 20210637283.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0: This spontaneous report received from the patient&#39;s wife concerns a 42-year-old male who was hospitalized for Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) 23 days after receiving Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. He does not smoke or drink alcohol, does not have underlying medical conditions, and was not taking concomitant medications. Two days post vaccination, he fell and injured his ankle twice while at work as a landscaper. After a few more days, he felt difficulty lifting his feet and could not move his toes. Fourteen days post-vaccination, tingling and numbness began in his arms, and he was referred to a neurologist who then referred him to the emergency room (ER) out of concern for possible transverse myelitis. At the ER, x-rays, MRI, Covid-19 tests, and other unspecified blood &amp; neurologic tests were performed; results not reported. Twenty-three days post-vaccination, he was diagnosed with GBS and hospitalized. He was treated with immunoglobulins and was discharged 4 days later. Nine days after discharge, the patient fell in his garage and could not lift his toes. At the time of this report, the patient had not recovered. Information regarding potential etiologies of GBS is insufficient, and the occurrence of the events could represent background incidence of such events in the general population. Considering the temporal relationship, the events are assessed to have an indeterminate relationship with vaccination.

                                                The first day after the vax was fine, but towards the end of the day I felt strange.  Half way through the second day, my pancreatitis came back with a vengeance for about a month, along with whole body inflammation for about a week, resufacing of neuralgias and other pain also.   The first week was the worst.  The whole body inflammation went away after a week.  But the pancreatitis flare up was worse than experienced before, and the amount of pain increased since the injection of the pancreas has increased by about 10 to 15 %, and has not returned to pre-vaccination levels.  I am taking more tramadol than ever now.     I WILL NEVER GET A COVID VACCINE AGAIN.

                                                Was having normal side effects including headache, fever, muscle aches which started about 6 hours after injections.  Roughly 14-16 hours after the injection (8:30-9am) started getting chest pain and slight shortness of breath.  Called my PCP and they told me to go to the ER as the chest pain is not normal.   At the ER they did an EKG which came back abnormal and I was rushed into a procedure to check my heart including a catheter, ultrasound, and a few more I will provide below.  Outcome after all the test was inflammation which I asked if it could have been in other areas of my body but doctor said it was my chest.  My C-Reactive Protein level was double the normal level.  They put me on 3 medications, Ibuprofen, one for Gout and Prilosec.

                                                Blood clot in superficial vein behind right knee as well as vertigo and nausea.  Currently on 30mg/day of XARELTO blood thinner (I&#39;ve been taking since diagnosis on 5/5/21).  Will continue to take 20mg/day for the next 30 days.  Background: I started to notice my right calf get tight and sore approximately ~3 weeks following my vaccination.  I had been doing a lot of running and hill training so I assumed it was a muscle strain/aggravation.  After approximately 1-2 weeks I noticed the tightness worsen and also noticed significant swelling around my lower calf/ankle.  I went to the doctor on 5/4/21 and was given a D Dimer blood test which came back 1.27 mcg/mL FEU (over the recommended 0.5 mcg/mL).  The next day I had an ultrasound of my right leg where they discovered the SVT clot behind my right knee in a superficial vein (but near a major/deep vein intersection).  I was immediately prescribed XARELTO blood thinner - to be taken for ~51 days.  ~21 days of 30mg/day (15mg twice/day) followed by ~30 days of 20mg/day 1x per day.  The morning of 5/20/21 around 6:30am I started to feel nausea and vertigo after returning home from walking my dog.  I finished a low-intensity exercise routine at my home and around ~7:15am my symptoms worsened.  I went upstairs to my bedroom to lay down on my bed and the room started spinning.  I then went to the bathroom and vomited clear fluid.  I started feeling a little better after vomiting but was still slightly dizzy and light-headed.  I made an appointment and went to the doctor around 10:30am.  The doctor suggested doing further bloodwork and a CT scan of my head.  Both tests came back normal.  The doctor suggested the vertigo and nausea were inner ear related and that I should continue taking XARELTO and to also start wearing a compression sock (especially during exercise/activity).

                                                Pt. received the vaccine at approximately 2:44pm.  Before I could hand him his card, his hands began trembling and he looked pale.  I asked how he was feeling.  He reported feeling shaky, dizzy, and very hot.  I asked him if he was having any difficulty breathing, had tightness in his throat/airways, or even felt a tingle.  He said no.  Noting the time, I asked if he had eaten lunch.  I asked if he has ever felt this way before.  He said he had when he gets a &#34;hypoglycemic attack.&#34;  While not diabetic nor on any medications, he said he will occasionally get very low blood sugar.  He said he had not eaten since early that morning.  Another employee brought some juice I requested.  I again asked him about symptoms related to anaphylaxis, to which was not an indication of an anaphylactic reaction.  I gave him the juice to sip.  I asked him again about symptoms.  Because he was still dizzy, I took his blood pressure/heart rate.  His BP was 160/119 and heart rate 96bpm.  His color became more gray over the next several minutes.  He was still too dizzy to stand, felt hot, shaky, and now nauseous.  He handed over the juice and was given a receptacle if he vomited.  We suspected a vasovagal response, but was still symptomatic after 10 minutes. Meanwhile, the other pharmacist tried to call his doctor&#39;s office.  We learned his doctor had moved away and he had not yet come in nor selected a new provider.   We asked him if he felt he needed to be seen by a doctor.  He said he did and agreed to us calling an ambulance.   The ambulance arrived around 3:10.  The EMTs took his BP.  It had come down, but he could not stand up without his knees buckling.  The EMTs got him on the stretcher and took him to the hospital.

                                                Patient does not remember most of the adverse event. Patient&#39;s partner reports that patient started feeling a tingling sensation on his left arm about 10 minutes after vaccination. Partner also reports that patient was hallucinating and sending her confusing text messages during his 15 minute observation period. The patient did not report feeling any adverse symptoms at the checkout station after his 15 minute observation period and before leaving the vaccination clinic.    After patient returned home, his partner reports considerable swelling on his left arm, continued hallucinations and trying to dismiss her concerns. Subsequently, that same day, partner reports the patient had a severe migrane and began to lose feeling on his left arm and leg, at which point the patient also lost consciousness.  Also at this point, the partner calls 911.   After arrival of emergency personnel, the patient regains consciousness, but does not remember name and complains of continued pain on his arm. He is transported to hospital where he spends 3 nights and receives treatment and care for stroke symptoms.    Patient reports that he does not remember much of anything 1.5 days after vaccination.   After returning home from hospital, patient complains of memory lapses and begins seeing neurologist for minor seizures during his sleep.   Wife reports that patient now lashes out and easily loses temper due to the fact that his memory is foggy.

                                                Ten days after vaccination I had an allergic shellfish reaction to a frozen lobster product.  Never happened before and I&#39;ve had other Lobster on the east coast before.  I also ate shrimp a few days prior to vaccination with no reaction.  I have eaten other Lobster all my life with no reaction.    My sinuses and throat closed up making it very difficult to breathe.   I didn&#39;t know what was happening so I took decongestants and antihistamines then went to the doctor and got injected with a steroid immune suppressor.  I now have epinephrine just in case it happens again.

                                                On 4/14/2021, right elbow started to hurt.  This was a site of a removed gout-caused mass over a year ago.  That subsided within a day.  On 4/15/2021, left foot started to hurt.  By 4/17/2021, the next to smallest toe and the large toe was swollen and very tender to any sort of touch.  It was not warm.  The pain was almost unbearable on 4/18/2021 and the suspicion that it might be gout was considered.  On 4/19/2021, after a visit with his doctor, gout was confirmed as the likely cause of the pain/swelling.  However, no blood tests were run to confirm.  Treatment for gout was initiated.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included exercise induced asthma, and no tobacco use (both current and historically), and other pre-existing medical conditions included the patient had no known allergies. The patient was not obese, denied recent procedures, prolonged immobility, family history of bleeding or clotting disease, etc. The patient was up to date on cancer screenings based on age/family history. He was reported as being an unusually physically active and fit 48 year-old male who has enjoyed good health and exercised regularly. In 2019, his platelet count was 177 10*9/L. The patient reported flying out of town and back on 30-MAR-2021 and 04-APR-2021 respectively with the longest continuous flight lasting around 4 hours. The patient at age 48, received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, intramuscular, batch number: 201A21A, expiry: UNKNOWN) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 07-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included finasteride, and salbutamol.  On  an unspecified date in APR-2021, the patient experienced mild headache.  On 18-APR-2021, 11 days after receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced deep vein thrombosis, vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia; new pain in his big toe, bilateral leg cramping (muscle spasm), bilateral lower extremity pain, and swelling. The patient attributed soreness in the large muscle groups of his thighs to Peloton riding and exercise. The patient travelled again via airplane to an unspecified location 22-APR-2021 and 25-APR-2021 (both1 hr long flights). The patient administered Advil for the leg pain when he returned on an unspecified date. On an unspecified date he felt a leg vessel that &#34;didn&#39;t seem right.&#34; On 26-APR-2021 the patient went to emergency department for evaluation presenting with leg pain and chest discomfort. He had normal vital signs and oxygen saturation. Additional laboratory results: Platelet count (NR 140-440  K/uL) 74;  fibrinogen (NR 150-430 mg/dL) of 254; D-dimer (NR 0-499 ng/mL FEU) 15,109 ng/mL FEU; activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) (NR 25.1-36.5 s)  31.8.  Venous duplex ultrasound of the lower extremities revealed non-occlusive DVT in the bilateral popliteal veins extending to the gastrocnemius veins, an occlusive DVT of the left posterior tibial vein, as well as occlusive superficial venous thrombosis in the bilateral saphenous veins.  The patient was discharged from the emergency room on rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily with two-day follow-up with his primary care physician. He had no known exposure to heparin before the onset of symptoms and no exposure during his emergency room visit. On 28-APR-2021 (also reported as the next day), the patient complained of a new onset of chest pain (pleuritic) and presented again to the emergency room.  Chest CT showed presence of acute pulmonary embolism, with emboli present in segmental and more proximal arteries. He had already taken his rivaroxaban for the night (1800). The patient was hospitalized for further evaluation and work up. A peripheral smear showed thrombocytopenia without schistocytes. The hematology service was consulted, and a presumptive diagnosis of VITT (vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia) was made. His anti-PF4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (LIFECODES PF4 IgG), performed on a sample collected prior to initiating IVIG therapy, demonstrated a strongly positive result of 3.323 optical density (OD) units (reference interval &lt; 0.399), consistent with a diagnosis of VITT. The patient was immediately treated with 1 g/kg of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) for 2 days, 1 mg/kg of prednisone, and switched from rivaroxaban to an intravenous argatroban infusion drip, during which he achieved therapeutic aPTT levels between 44 - 50 sec.  The patient was also treated with apixaban.  Other studies included:  Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) and angiography (MRA) of the brain, performed due to symptoms of mild headaches, were unremarkable. Platelet factor 4 (NR: not provided) strong positive at 2.9 OD; Prothrombin mutation G20210A not detected, Red blood cell count (NR: 3.98 - 5.98) 5.07 M/ microliter, Red blood cell sedimentation rate (NR: not provided) Normal, SARS-CoV-2 test was negative, Serotonin release assay was positive, and WBC (NR: 3.2 - 10.6) 5.8 K/microliter. Anticardiolipin antibodies (NR: not provided) 5 GPL, Beta-2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies (NR: 0 - 20) 0 SGU, 5 SMU, Blood homocysteine (NR: not provided) 13.4 nml (normal), C-reactive protein (NR: not provided) 2.6, Cardiolipin immunoglobulin G (NR: 0 - 12) 6 MPL, Cell marker increased was positive, EKG (NR: not provided) Normal, Hematocrit (NR: 36.9 - 52.1) 42.2 %, Hemoglobin (NR: 2.5 - 18.0) 15.0 g/dL, Lupus anticoagulant (NR: not provided) not detected, MCHC (NR: 33.4 - 35.3) 35.5 g/dL, MCV (NR: 80.6 - 97.6) 83.2 fL. On an unspecified date the serotonin release assay was no longer positive. Within a week post-discharge, the patient developed recurrent thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count that down trended to 107  10*9/L  His thrombocytopenia appeared to somewhat correlate with prednisone dose adjustments, suggesting an autoimmune-driven process, although it did not respond to repeat IVIG administration. Due to the normalized D-Dimer levels and negative SRA, it was assumed that there was no further ongoing platelet activation. The authors stated the patient had no prior risk factors for thrombosis other than the 2 recent 4-hour flights. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from bilateral lower extremity pain, was recovering from deep vein thrombosis, vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, platelet count decreased, swelling, full blood count, metabolic function tests, muscle spasms, ultrasound doppler abnormal, and multiple acute bilateral pulmonary emboli, and the outcome of mild headache was not reported. This report was serious (Hospitalization Caused / Prolonged). This case is a duplicate of 20210642952.  Additional information was received from literature article on 19-JUN-2021. The following information was updated and incorporated into the case narrative: literature reference information, additional reporters, laboratory data, updated events.  It has been determined that Manufacture Report Number 20210514958 is a duplicate of deleted case 20210642952. All relevant information from Manufacture Report Number 20210642952 will be reported in this case 20210514958.; Sender&#39;s Comments: V2: Follow up consisted of a literature citation, presenting this case as a case report.  This does not change the previous assessment. This case obtained via VAERS (ID 1264060) concerns a 48-year-old White male who developed symptoms of bilateral lower extremity deep vein thromboses (DVT) and thrombocytopenia 11 days after receiving Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. Concurrent conditions included exercise induced asthma. Patient was not obese, did not smoke, denied recent procedures, family history of bleeding/clotting disease &amp; was physically active. He was up to date on cancer screenings based on age/family history. He had taken two 1-hour long flights 15 days and 18 days post-vaccination.  Concomitant medications included finasteride &amp; salbutamol. After 1 week of bilateral leg cramping &amp; swelling which began 11 days post-vaccination, he presented to emergency department (ED) where complete blood count showed platelets 74 k/uL, peripheral smear with giant platelets, and d-Dimer 15K. Venous duplex ultrasound showed nonocclusive DVT in the bilateral popliteal veins extending to the gastrocnemius veins, occlusive superficial vein thrombosis in the bilateral saphenous veins, and occlusive DVT of the left posterior tibial vein. He was started on rivaroxaban &amp; was not hospitalized. Two days later, he developed new chest pain &amp; returned to ED, where CT chest showed numerous bilateral pulmonary emboli. He was hospitalized; empiric treatment for vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia was started: IVIG, steroids, &amp; argatroban.  Anti-PF4 resulted as OD=2.9 and 3.323 (strong positive), confirming diagnosis. The patient was recovering from the events. Based on evolving knowledge of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS, per definition from Brighton Collaboration), low platelet count &amp; temporal relationship to vaccination, the events are assessed to have a plausible relationship with vaccination.

                                                About a month after receiving the J&amp;J vaccine, I noticed a bump in the top of my left calf, which caused some discomfort and also noticed slight numbness in left foot / toes.  Primary, Dr., sent me for ultrasound, which showed I had several blood clots in my leg.  I have never had any blood clots before.  Dr.  referred me to Hematologist, Dr.  She ran extensive blood tests and found no genetic predisposition for clots.  She stated it was likely the vaccine that caused me to develop blood clots.  I am now on blood thinners to try to dissolve them and may have to take them for life if the clots don&#39;t go away in the new few months.  Follow up ultrasound scheduled 9/7/21.

                                                Swollen lymph nodes and abdominal pain from right him bone down to scrotum. Pain on 4/7 was such that i though i was suffering a hernia.  Couldn&#39;t get out of car or move my right leg across my body. Could put right leg into pants leg.  Hurt to bend over and do much of anything on 4/7.   Initially thought pain was in testicle but doesn&#39;t hurt at all to the touch.  Realized it more a swollen area in the groin between hip bone and scrotum.   Nothing hurts to the touch at all in that area either which lead my to believe it was swollen lymph nodes.  The  Feeling is as if i got hit in the right groin  and my testicle has been hit and discomfort is 8 inches above right testicle in my groin area.    It has been improving every day since then, the more i walk the better it is.  It only hurts when i sit now and it seems to aggravate it pretty well but once i start moving the pain goes away.  It has been 9 days now and the i don&#39;t notice it all day until i come back to the office and sit at my desk and again it gets aggravated and the discomfort feels like my right testicle is near my appendix  Since this all started my legs feel heavier in the calf and have little nerve sensations when i sit too, which concerns me about the blood clot possibility and so i have been emailing with my doctor.  I am going to make appt for Monday 4/19

I started having chest pain and headaches. I ended up at ER. They gave me pain meds and did a CT Scan and ultrasound, which were both clear. The next day, I was walking around and my hand and arm started hurting and then went numb. My right wrist was swollen to twice its size. I went to care and they told me to go back to the ER. They eventually did another ultrasound, but the swelling had gone down by then. A few hours later, my left arm started to swell and lasted for about 4 hours. From there, I had pain in my arms and legs for a few days after that, but then I was fine.

After going to the chiropractor two times the knot and pain ended up in my right leg. I then went to Urgent Care where they diagnosed me with a large blood clot. They sent me to imaging and after scanning the area confirmed that there was a blood clot in my right leg. Urgent Care then set me up with a specialist.

The patient&#39;s height and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included high blood pressure and diabetes.  The patient received COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S (suspension for injection, route of administration not reported, batch number 1802070, expiry date unknown), dose not reported, 1 total administered on 19-APR-2021 for prophylactic vaccination on left arm. Concomitant medications included amlodipine besilate for drug used for unknown indication, empagliflozin for drug used for unknown indication, fenofibrate for drug used for unknown indication, insulin aspart for drug used for unknown indication, insulin glargine for drug used for unknown indication, losartan for drug used for unknown indication, and pioglitazone hydrochloride for drug used for unknown indication. On an unspecified date (reported as 22-MAR-2021; 28 days prior to vaccination), the patient experienced shortness of breath, heart rate increased, runny nose, chills and was hospitalized (date unspecified). He reported that on this past Saturday, 17-APR-2021 (2 days prior to vaccination), he went to the emergency room. He reported that his toenails were coming off, the skin on his toes was coming off, and he had swelling in his right foot and up his leg. He says there was no circulation going to his toe and he was diagnosed with having a blood clot in his right leg. He says he had surgery to open up the arteries in his leg, and also reported gangrene in his toe. The subject was discharged on 21-APR-2021. On 23-APR-2021, the patient experienced feeling hot. He also reported that he may need to have his right pinky (fifth) toe amputated because it has gangrene. He reported that he is going to go back to the hospital, to which he would seek medical attention if he was having issues. Treatment medications (dates unspecified) included paracetamol. When called back due to his vaccination dates being after event start dates, the patient said that his memory is not too good, so he &#39;had to take his time to remember the correct dates&#39;. The action taken with COVID-19 vaccine Ad26.CoV2.S was not applicable. The patient was recovering from blood clot in leg, and had not recovered from runny nose, shortness of breath, heart rate increased, chills, feeling hot, gangrene in toe, right leg swollen, and right foot swollen. This report was serious (caused hospitalization).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 50-year-old  hypertensive and diabetic male patient reported that he was feeling hot and may need to have his fifth toe amputated because it has gangrene 4 days after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and 2 days after discharge form the hospital.  The patient was hospitalized for shortness of breath, heart rate increased, runny nose, and chills 28 days prior to vaccination.  The patient went to the emergency room 2 days prior to vaccination because his toenails/skin on his toes were coming off, swelling in his right foot and up his leg, gangrene in his toe; he reported that there was no circulation going to his toe and was diagnosed with having a blood clot in his right leg; the patient reported he had surgery to &#34;open up&#34; the arteries in his leg. Four days after vaccination, the patient felt hot and reported reported that he may need to have his right pinky (fifth) toe amputated because it has gangrene.  The patient is taking paracetamol as treatment.  No other details was reported.  Based on the lack of temporal association, the causality is considered not related for the events blood clot in leg, shortness of breath, heart rate increased, right leg swelling, right foot swelling, chills, and runny nose.  The information available regarding event gangrent of fifth toe and feeling hot precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY PUT ME ON ELIQUIS. THE DOSE FOR THE FIRST 2 WEEKS WAS 10MG TWICE A DAY (10 MG MORNING AROUND 8AM AND 10 MG AROUND 8 PM). AFTER 14 DAYS HE REDUCED MY DOSE TO 5 MG AM AND 5 MG PM.

                                                On June 29, 2021 I got poked by a plant on my left hand, my vaccine was on my left arm, and the reaction was anaphylaxis. I have been poked by this plant before, and I never had a reaction. I had the ambulance and the whole bit come out. I was taken to the hospital and was put on 4 different IVs. I was in the hospital for like 4 or 6 hours. I haven&#39;t been hospital again but it happened again 7/06/2021, I had the anaphylaxis again, it was triggered on it&#39;s own. No thorns or anything.  I took 2 doses of  Benadryl. The second dose stopped it. I&#39;m on over on medication, Benadryl, Prednisone, Pepcid, Meclizine (takes care of any dizziness), to keep the anaphylaxis shock from coming back. As soon as I stop taking the medication it probably would come back. I have one more week of medication left.

You should have a 24/7 hotline or something or add this to your possible side effects at least.

He was transferred to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a flesh eating bacteria in the right leg where the pain was at and Sepsis.  He was taken to surgery to debride the right leg and was started on CVVHD because his new kidney was now failing, he eventually was started back on Hemodialysis and taken to surgery 2 more times where he cardiac arrested on the table in surgery and died.  A private autopsy is being performed but the preliminary results shows he had multi-system organ failure, including his liver which was NEVER a problem in the past.

Staff attempted x 2 to assess his left arm. Patient refused both times. Staff observed that patient did have full range of motion with no complaints of pain or discomfort.  Appt  was  set up to assess his left arm edema. Both times patient refused.  Dr was made aware  that patient still has some edema and that staff was unable to measure related to uncooperative nature of  patient.  Dr. feels it is an adverse reaction to his Covid-19 (Adenovirus) Vaccine. This is now listed on his Allergy list.  Dr feels this edema will resolve itself.

                                                In March I had a pain in my left calf muscle that I could not identify with getting hit or injuring it in any way. I called Urgent care because i read and heard about problem with the J&amp;J vaccine that it was giving people blood clots. Urgent care said there was no need to come in that there was very little reason to believe that it was a blood clot. Then in June I woke up to very severe pain in my left leg from my foot all the way to my thigh. It was hot, swollen and I could barely bend my knee. I went to Urgent Care and they sent me across the street to the Hospital for an ultra sound on my leg. Here are the result from the ultra sound.  Real time color Doppler imaging and spectral analysis were performed during ultrasound evaluation of the left lower extremity is performed. There is persistent occlusive deep venous thrombosis within the mid to distal superficial femoral vein extending nonocclusive bleed to involve the popliteal vein and exclusively within the proximal popliteal and peroneal veins of the calf. The doctor put me on 3 week of taking a blood thinner twice a day and then will go down to taking one blood thinner once a day for 6 months. I also saw MD. Here are his notes from my Drs appt. Patient is seen today, 6/14/2021, to discuss management of left leg DVT.   Patient presented to urgent care on 5/20/2021.  He had noticed soreness in his left leg for a couple of days and then he awoke that day and the leg was swollen.  The duplex scan showed that he had occlusive clot involving left superficial femoral vein extending through popliteal vein down to peroneal vein in the left calf.  He was started on rivaroxaban 15 mg twice daily.   He transitions to 20 mg rivaroxaban daily tomorrow.   The leg soreness has eased slightly but the swelling has not improved.  He did have a repeat duplex scan on 6/7/2021 which was unchanged.  Thrombus persisted but was not worse.   He has not had chest pain or breathing issues or dyspnea.  He does recall that about 4 weeks earlier he had a muscle spasm sensation in the left calf.  He had received a Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid immunization in late February, 2021.  He was aware of the public information about venous clotting in women who had received the J&amp;J vaccine and was also aware that it involved cerebral veins.  He called his provider and was asked questions about the leg and otherwise the answers were negative.  So imaging was not obtained.  The muscle spasm sensation did not recur.   His family history is negative for clots in his personal history for clots is otherwise negative.  He is a maintenance manager.  He has not had lengthy travel recently.  He also denies any trauma to the legs.   He has a history of GERD from which she had developed iron deficiency anemia in June 2020.  He had undergone EGD has a result.  He also had a colonoscopy when he turned 50 years of age and had polyps removed and then had repeat colonoscopy 6 months later.  This evaluation occurred with Dr. of gastroenterology. His colonoscopy was on 12/20/2018.  One of the polyps was a hyperplastic polyp.  The second was a tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia/intramucosal adenocarcinoma, 2 cm size.  Polyps were excised.  Had repeat endoscopy on 7/10/2019 he had a hyperplastic polyp in his rectum.   Also he had a PSA checked in summer 2020.  It was 0.5.

Left lower extremity DVT.  Etiology unclear.  No definite provocation.  He did receive a Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine in late February, 2021.  He first noticed a muscle spasm sensation in left calf in mid April, 2021 and then had onset of soreness 2 days before his visit with swelling onset the day of his urgent care visit, 5/20/2021.   Currently on rivaroxaban.  Transitioning now to the 20 mg daily dose.   Family history negative for DVT as is his personal history.  PSA was unremarkable and summer 2020.  Has had prior colonoscopy in December 2018 and June 2019.  Did have finding of sigmoid colon polyps with atypia in 1 and possible noninvasive adenocarcinoma.  Repeat scope showed hyperplastic polyp but no additional polyps.  Has also had EGDs in March 2019 and June 2020 because of GERD and iron lack anemia.  Non-smoker.   I discussed with patient that we would usually treat him for 6 months with anticoagulation and then reassess to determine whether it is safe to discontinue therapy.  But if he has ongoing swelling and soreness in his leg it would be difficult to stop treatment because we would lose one of our early indicators of recurrence of DVT.  I also suggested that we should do a lab panel to assure that he does not have any underlying inherited or acquired abnormality that predispose to this clot, since we do not have any clear-cut causative etiology.  (We discussed that the Covid immunization may have been his predisposition, but that existing data suggest that this is a risk factor in females and that most of the episodes were central nervous system venous clots.)     PLAN:   1.  So we will draw lab panel assessing acquired and inherited predispositions for hypercoagulability.  And we will plan to see him back in a couple of months to reassess his status.

                                                patient experienced a vasovagal type reaction within minutes of receiving vaccine. He fainted and bumped his head on the floor. He came to within seconds of fainting and had not realized he had fainted. An ice pack was given to the patient to hold to his left eyebrow bone (where he hit the ground) in order to reduce swelling. He was guided into a chair and observed for about 20 minutes when he wanted to leave the pharmacy.  The patient felt well shortly after the fall. I checked in with him 2 hours later and he still felt well.

We requested him to stay in observation for 30 minutes after vaccine administration. He agreed and vaccine was administered. After working  approximately 3 hours later he returned to the pharmacy stating he felt out of breath. He didn&#39;t know if it was because of vaccine or CHF. Questioning him further, he said he felt a little swollen around neck. He was responsive. Administered 50mg of Benadryl. Instructed him to sit. He had a portable fan. After sitting down, he started to feel better. He remained at the pharmacy and called for transportation home, leaving approximately 1 hour later

                                                Shortly after receiving the vaccination I started to experience chronic exhaustion, leg cramping and pain in my lower back right side, upper right thigh, behind my right knee and down into my right calf. I figured that the pain would go away but the pain increased and my leg started swelling and the pain increased making it very difficult for me to put my leg down on the ground and put pressure on my right leg.

Next morning pain, swelling and nausea persisted. Medium intensity body aches and headache began late morning. By mid afternoon body pain increased to the point that I was no longer able to function and needed to lie down.  Took a 4 hour nap. Side effects persisted after waking up.  At time of writing, 28hrs after vaccine, I am still feeling the side effect although less severe. Ibuprofen and Tylenol  do seem to help.

I hobbled around that day and noticed my foot was swollen. The next morning, I went to Piedmont Hospital ER( on the 14th) - they gave me a starter dose of blood thinners and I was able to schedule appt with Dr. Shamm -my  hematologist -  Zeralto - was what she prescribed. Everything is &#34;back to normal.&#34; But based on my health history - the doctor care will be ongoing and I&#39;ll continue to see this doctor for treatment.

Which prompt me to call for an ambulance. I went into the ER I had to get 3 bags of IV fluids for dehydration, anti-nausea medication, pain medication for back pain because I passed out and hurt my back and cut my face. I also had swollen in my left foot. I am still having fatigue feeling. I still don&#39;t have my energy levels back from before the adverse event.

                                                To begin, I have always been a healthy, middle-aged male, with no history at all of neurological problems. What follows is a comprehensive summary of all that happened to me shortly (7 days) after getting the Janssen COVID vaccine and the supporting documentation to support the diagnosis of my having developed Guillian-Barre&#39; Syndrome (GBS) as a direct and obvious consequence of the vaccine.    THURSDAY, 5/13/21: Received the J&amp;J vaccine at 10:00 AM (LOT NUMBER 205A21A).   FRIDAY - THURSDAY, 5/13 - 5/20/21: No obvious reaction to the vaccine, at all.   FRIDAY, 5/21/21: During the day, I noticed deep-muscle pain/soreness in both shoulders (deltoid muscles) that increased throughout the day. It felt as if I had been doing heavy-weight presses with the resulting soreness.  I attributed it to a delayed reaction from the vaccine (as I&#39;d heard muscle pain, particularly in the shoulders, is a common reaction symptom), as I had no injury or other possible cause and chose to ignore it.  It may have even started a day or two before Friday, but wasn&#39;t of such consequence as for me to recall it; the only vivid memory I have is the discomfort on Friday, 5/21/21.   SATURDAY - SUNDAY, 5/22 - 5/23/21: I had continued shoulder pains, but ignored them because they were not acute and just attributed them to a short-term vaccine reaction.   MONDAY, 5/24/21: In the evening, while sitting in the bleachers attending a sporting event, I noticed my buttocks was pretty sore. The bleachers are not normally comfortable, but this was a dull, serious ache across my entire buttocks. I didn&#39;t know to what to attribute it (not yet at that time associating it with the shoulder pain), so ignored it. In retrospect, I realized later that the soreness I was feeling at that time was similar to the shoulder pain and was the pain felt from a deep numbness across the buttocks, akin to when a body part (hand, foot, etc) &#34;falls asleep&#34; so deeply that it&#39;s numb, but is still very, very sore.  Later that night, my upper back began to feel sore, from shoulder to shoulder, down to my mid-back. As the night progressed, this pain increased exponentially to a &#34;Level 10&#34;, leaving me unable to sleep but in 15-minute increments, wandering the house to find a spot -- sofa, chair, floor, anywhere -- to give me some comfort to sleep; I slept 2 hours, total, that night.  The pain across my back felt equivalent to someone beating me with a baseball bat all over my upper back -- it wasn&#39;t an acute, localized pain, but very deep and broad across the area.  Normally, Aleve quickly resolves any pain issues I have, but overnight, it did nothing to reduce the pain.   TUESDAY, 5/25/21: I began to piggyback Aleve and Extra Strength Tylenol, and that seemed to help abate a little of the most intense pain, but it was still painful and precluded sleep and much of my working.  I think it was at this time that I began to notice the pain and numbness going beyond my buttocks, down the backs of my legs, and into my feet, leaving my feet (and toes, in particular) numb and tingling.  I also began to notice a problem with balance and gross motor controls (stumbling when walking, nearly falling several times in the shower) -- all symptoms I have never experienced in any capacity.  Additionally, I had considerable pain down the backs of my legs, leading me to feel as if my calves and hamstrings had been through a heavy workout the day before and desperately needed stretching -- however, any attempts to do so led to excruciating, stabbing pains in those muscles.  I also noticed that the pain in my upper back was becoming more acute and localized in my cervical vertebrae area. Having taken care of a father who has had many back surgeries and suspecting I have my own degenerative cervical disc issues (I&#39;ve had past neck pains), I began to believe that all the pain and numbness throughout my body might be due to a cervical issue (e.g., bulging disc, stenosis, etc), and so tried to treat the area as such, with hot shower, heating pad, better neck support, etc.  I continued to piggyback the two pain meds that day, but the upper back and neck pain and numbness and gross motor issues came back in full that night, again leaving me no relief for sleep -- I could only doze in 15-minute increments and found no position or place to sleep that was comfortable; I was in tremendous pain  10) across my entire back and down my legs. By 2:00 AM, I knew there was going to be no relief, and I couldn&#39;t wait until the morning; I drove myself to the nearby ER, again still believing/expecting at the time that this was a spinal issue.  In the ER, I was met by a PA who reviewed my situation, determined that cervical imaging was unnecessary, and prescribed Percocet.  My blood pressure was recorded at 160/94. I was released after two hours and returned home.  Despite the meds, I was still in considerable pain that night and found myself unable to sleep in more than 10- to 15-minute increments.   WEDNESDAY, 5/26/21: During the day, the Percocet seemed to abate the pain, somewhat, although it tended to flare up much more at night during the prior 2 nights, anyway.  However, I noticed I had an upset stomach by midday, and as the day progressed, the pain in my abdomen grew considerably. By the evening, the pain across my abdomen was unbearable, as bad as it was in my back and legs. Late in the evening, I researched Percocet and saw that abdominal pain and nausea are two prominent side effects.  I stopped taking the pain medication immediately, knowing that my back pain would return in full through the night; again, I slept in 15-minute increments in considerable back and abdominal pain for a total of about 3 hours.  It was also during the day Wednesday that I noticed considerably worse gross motor skills (e.g., walking, ascending/descending stairs, standing up straight, writing), balance, and increased numbness and tingling in my legs, feet, and hands. At one point, I tried to walk by my daughter in a hallway in the house, and in trying to go around her, I fell against the wall. She thought I was joking; I wasn&#39;t. It happened several more times that week.  Also, this day or the next, I started noticing additional problems with urinating and defecating. It felt as though I had no control over my abdominal muscles, so could not strain or push when going to the bathroom. When trying to have a bowel movement -- and I knew needed to -- I felt as though I had no control to push; when urinating, I had no muscle support for pushing out the urine.   THURSDAY, 5/27/21: Still believing these pain, numbness, and other neurological, problems to be related to cervical vertebrae/disc issues, I had an appointment with a spine orthopedist. He ordered cervical X-Rays and confirmed that I do have disc compression/degeneration, but not excessive and nothing that could explain the pain and numbness persisting all over my back, down to my hands, across my buttocks, and down my legs to my feet. The message: the cervical discs were not the problem.  This is when I reconsidered all I had been through, tying back to the initial pain I felt in my shoulders the prior Friday. This is when I realized that my body had been reacting to the vaccine. Never before in my life had I had neurological problem. Never before had I experienced pain, numbness, and tingling across my entire body that way, so until that moment, I hadn&#39;t considered the vaccine to be a possible vector for all that was going on with me.  The coincidence of these events was FAR too great to be anything but a causal relationship. The likelihood of these symptoms arising on their own is infinitesimal in comparison to a causal effect. The vaccine had triggered a serious and painful neurological response in my body.  The orthopedist, knowing I had responded poorly to the Percocet, prescribed oxycodone. I took that pain medicine that day and into the evening, but once again, my stomach and abdomen began to bother me and the abdominal pain returned. Once again, I looked at the side effects of the medicine, and the first two I saw were stomach pain and nausea. I stopped taking the pain medicine immediately. That night, I slept a total of 2.5 hours.   FRIDAY, 5/28/21: I was still in considerable pain, and that combined with very little sleep (and none of it good) for 4 days led me to having trouble thinking clearly. My wife insisted I needed to go back to the ER in the morning to see what could be going on. My blood pressure upon being seen was initially approximately 185/140, but what was finally recorded after a second test was 191/112. I waited to be seen for about 2 hours, but I finally met with the ER physician and described my history of problems that week, including my then-belief that this was a vaccine reaction. She ordered full bloodwork, chest X-Ray and CT scans (without contrast) of lumbar and thoracic spine and CT scan with contrast of chest/abdomen. Nothing strikingly abnormal was found in these scans, but doctors (ER physician and neurologist) noted bliteral weakness in lower and upper body. The doctors wanted to order MRIs, but I am unable to have an MRI due to a piece of metal in my left eye. The morphine I was administered helped reduce my pain and my blood pressure upon leaving had abated, somewhat (don&#39;t recall my final BP). Both doctors seemed not to believe that these symptoms could be the result of an adverse vaccine reaction, but they were unable to explain a cause. On my inquiry, at my friend&#39;s recommendation I ask to verify, the neurologist disagreed that these were symptoms of a presentation of Guillian-Barre&#39; Syndrome (GBS). The ER doctor asked if I was interested in being admitted, but I felt some of my more extreme symptoms (blood pressure and pain -- thanks to the morphine) had abated sufficiently to allow me to leave. After 8 hours in the ER, I left and returned home.  My numbness, tingling, some pain, balance, and motor skills issues persisted, but were blunted somewhat (probably from the morphine?). It was either this day or the next, that I was standing outside, and knowing I had problems walking and with balance, I decided to try to run a few steps to see how weak my legs were and bad my motor skills and balance were. Immediately, it was clear that things were worse than I had considered. I had very poor control of my legs -- they flew off to the sides, out of control, as I tried to step; I stumbled a couple times and almost fell; and I couldn&#39;t proceed in a straight line, veering off at an angle. I earnestly tried several times, with the same results each time.  That night, while the pain was still there, it was tolerable enough that I was able to sleep for a total of about 5 hours.   SATURDAY, 5/29/21: Early in the AM, I noticed I was unable to smile. Having a friend who had had Bell&#39;s Palsy, I recognized the signs immediately. The left side of my face sagged, I was unable to smile (left side of my mouth sagged), and I was unable to close my left eye. My wife took me to the ER, and we were met by the same ER physician who had seen me the day before. She was shocked about my return so soon after my prior visit. My blood pressure, on being admitted, was 151/102, but as with my other visits, asymptomatic other than the problems described before (pain, numbness, and tingling, in my back, arms, legs, and abdomen; gross motor movement; lack of coordination; and lack of clarity in thinking); no other signs of infection or illness. The Dr ordered a CT scan (without contrast) of my head and other bloodwork. Of note, the CK came back at 712 U/L. The CT scan came back normal. Again, I was administered morphine, which abated my pain and allowed me to relax. After 3 hours, I was released, with prescriptions for Amlodipine for the high blood pressure and Prednisone and Valtrex (Valacyclovir) for the Bell&#39;s Palsy.  The morphine helped reduce my back and abdominal pain and give me some comfort, such that I could sleep another 5 hours that night, although all other symptoms persisted.   SUNDAY - WEDNESDAY, 5/30/21 - 6/2/21: I continued to experience the numbness and tingling in my back (primarily), abdomen, legs/feet, and arms/hands, but my severe pain began to abate, such that I could sleep a bit more easily. I taped my eye shut at night, as my Bell&#39;s Palsy eyelid would not close fully, and it teared constantly.   WEDNESDAY, 6/2/21: Not having a GP, I finally found an Internist to review my case and symptoms, but primarily to extend my meds (Blood Pressure and antiviral and steroid for the Bell&#39;s Palsy), as the ER doctor had only given me a 5-day prescription. The doctor review my situation and continued the meds. Having been prompted regularly by my friend to confirm a GBS diagnosis, I asked this doctor about a possible GBS-vaccine link and after a cursory review, he said he did not think so.   THURSDAY, 6/3/21: With the weakness in my left eyelid, my desire to find a resolution to it, and my concerns about its effect on my vision, I had an appointment with my opthamologist, who recommended eye drops until the eye improved and instructed me to stop taping the eye shut. She noted no other problems with my vision.   FRIDAY - MONDAY, 6/4/21 - 6/7/21: During this time, the medicines for my Bell&#39;s Palsy seemed to take effect, and the paralysis symptoms abated mostly (with some residual weakness in my left eyelid).  I continued to experience the other neurological symptoms, however.   TUESDAY, 6/8/21: Having been unable to get a timely appointment with a trusted neurologist, a friend with a contact at medical school head of neurology was able to get me an appointment with a neurology faculty member. I met with Dr. that afternoon, and he was the first to really listen to the symptoms I had and understand some of the possible triggers and consequences of them. I started the conversation explaining that I&#39;m a reasonable, rational, and science-based person, an engineer by training and career, and that I firmly believed all the symptoms I was presenting were a direct consequence of my getting the vaccine.  Additionally, at my friend&#39;s continued urging, I asked if these symptoms could point to a Guillian-Barre&#39; diagnosis.  He was at first skeptical of my proposition of the vaccine cause, but was quick to say he was glad I had raised the question of GBS, because he had that diagnosis in mind, as I discussed my symptoms.  He believed that the symptoms I had and the way and speed with which they had progressed pointed to a likely GBS diagnosis.  He scheduled a follow-on appointment to have an Electromyogram (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Study to assess the extent of the neurological damage and prognosis for resolution, as I am unable to get an MRI and he seemed to feel a lumbar puncture was unnecessary.    FRIDAY, 6/11/21: I had my scheduled EMG and Nerve Conduction Study with Dr. The results showed some abnormal neuropathy, but mostly normal in my extremities and indicative of some recovery from symptoms. Although I still had considerable numbness, tingling, and some pain down my legs into my feet and down my arms into my hands, my most prevalent issues at that point were numbness and tingling across my entire upper back and abdomen, but the doctor indicated these tests don&#39;t identify issues very well, that they are better designed for testing neurological issues in the extremities. We agreed to reconvene over the phone in several weeks, unless problems worsened.   TUESDAY, 6/29/21:   During a follow-up appointment with the doctor, I indicated that some of my neurological issues were abating and that my blood pressure had returned to near-normal range.  My energy was returning to a degree and my motor skills and balance and control had improved.  However, I continued to have significant numbness and tingling across my back and abdomen, and of greater concern, I had increasing tingling and pain going down my left arm to my index finger when I stretched out my arm.  This was a new symptom and increased in pain in frequency in the following days and raises the question of what other symptoms might arise.    AS OF 7/8/21:  CURRENT STATUS: I have continued numbness and tingling in my feet and hands and back and abdomen, although they are reduced from their earlier state. However, I have increased shooting pain in my left index finger when stretching out my left arm. Additionally, I have a mild increase in weakness in my left eyelid, after prior improvement from the Bell&#39;s Palsy. My dangerously high blood pressure at the early onset of these symptoms has returned to near-normal levels, although my GP continues to keep on blood pressure medicine (Amlodopine) for now. Finally, a lot of the issues I had thinking clearly and regularly making mental mistakes, all noticeable and commented on by my family, have lessened, although I still find myself making mental mistakes and forgetting information that would have been MUCH less likely prior to this adverse GBS event caused by the J&amp;J vaccine.

                                                On March 28th, started noticing symptoms. There was pain in my entire right leg, shin swelling; calf- swelling and skin discoloration; and right foot - swelling. On 4/1, I went to Urgent Care where I was seen, evaluated and treated by Dr. She ordered blood tests and an ultrasound within 20 minutes. I had 4 blood clots in 3 veins in my right leg/DVT. My blood platelet value was 267 and the standard range is 130 to 400. They didn&#39;t consider it low, but it&#39;s still an issue. I was given an injection of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection--1 ml injection twice a day for 5 days, which was started in the ER. I then switched to Pradaxa 150mg pill twice a day. I took that until around the 6th of this month when I noticed my right leg had gotten worse. I was instructed to go back to the urgent care. Another ultrasound was ordered and it showed I still had the 4 blood clots in 3 veins that seems to have worsened, so the meds were not working. He consulted with a vascular surgeon and they put me back on the injection once a day, which I am currently still on. I was told to follow up with my PCP in two weeks and that appt is on Thursday with Dr.

It was difficult to walk or even put pressure on it for 5 days and I treated it with ice, elevation and 600 mg ibuprofen 3X/day.  Symptoms are starting to resolve , but the joint is still swollen and red, though the pain is subsiding.  I am able to walk with a normal gait, though there is still stiffness and some pain.

                                                My health was great before my vaccine. I was able to have a normal full day five days out of the first 60 without health issues. This week I haven&#39;t had one day where I haven&#39;t had something going on.  I woke up day after vaccination and started feeling feverish, but going into bad chills, extreme headache, a different kind of headache than my migraines, abdominal had pain, heart rate and breathing, heart rate was elevated, breathing not normal, out of breath, deep pain right thigh at bone, did not bruise. I called cardiologist 03/25/2021, about thigh, thought it might be DVT, I followed up 03/29/2021 since I did not hear back, we spoke on the 30th, I had very high blood pressure, doc presumed I had a tress fracture of right thigh bone and that other things were related to my chronic intro viruses. I saw my infectious disease doctor on April 13th he said this could be a major conflict with either current viruses, meds taking in conjunction with vaccination. All of my major lymph nodes were inflamed. I do have non Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma, but they told me it is slow growing. Visited ER on 04/14/2021. Dr met me there.

                                                Fevers started on Wednesday evening, April 14th. Over the next three to four days, the fevers and chills continuously got worse. Patient experienced fatigue, congestion, headaches, sore throat, body aches, neck pain. Conducted a televisit on Sunday, April 18th, and then went into the doctor on Monday, April 19th. The day of the doctor appointment, the patient could not get out of bed and could not stand for longer than 15 minutes at a time before extreme fatigue set in. Blood tests were taken at the doctor, a Z-pack was prescribed. The evening of the 19th, the doctor called after hour to send patient to emergency room to be admitted to hospital. Patient went immediately to Medical Center at which point, the patient was admitted for the next 19 days. The patient was released from the hospital on Saturday, May 8th. While in the hospital, the patient saw almost every &#34;category&#34; of doctor possible. Patient experienced fevers every night for 15 days straight, and after release from the hospital and &#34;fever free for 4-5 days, experienced fevers again for the next week. Doctors were unable for the first two and a half weeks of hospitalization to draw a conclusion about what was the cause of the sepsis (systemic). Patient received daily blood tests, MRIs, CAT scans, spinal tap, bone marrow biopsy, echocardiogram, etc. Patient spent the first two and a half weeks on an antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral.  The &#34;final&#34; diagnosis, which is still not confirmed, as histoplasmosis, which per the doctor would not have placed the patient in the hospital. Determined the fevers were officially &#34;fevers of unknown origin&#34; with a diagnosis of MIS-A and a vaccine contributing factor. Medication put patient in kidney failure and did not address the fevers (patient had fevers of 103&#43; for 25&#43; days in a row).  On May 27th, doctors are conducing new fungal tests and patient is discontinuing antifungal medication because of severe liver damage.  Patient was not and is not in a situation where histoplasmosis is a logical conclusion based on the patient&#39;s daily activities.

Immediately, after I left the vaccine shot location, like within 5 minutes, I started to smell fish and my mouth tasted like salt for three days. I also had excruciating headaches that did not go away with advil. So I rested a  lot and had no real big appetite what so ever!.  Today, I am concerned that on my left side below my left clavicle, I feel a big bump what appears to be possibly a lymphatic swelling of node? I am concerned because I did not have this swelling before and do not know if it&#39;s a reaction to the vaccine.  Pls contact me via phone, this is urgent.  Thanks

No concomitant medications were reported.  On 14-APR-2021, patient experienced pain and tingling sensation on his back but he still went to work. On 16-APR-2021, he did not go to work, tingling sensation started going on his hands. On 17-APR-2021, patient went to the emergency clinic, and was told the symptoms might be cause by herniated disc.

On 20-APR-2021, symptoms worsened and patient was paralyzed from the shoulder down. On 21-APR-2021, patient went to the hospital and was admitted. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) found nothing on patient&#39;s neck and showed old back injury, but per patient&#39;s doctor it should not cause the paralysis. Unspecified additional tests were done, and Guillain-Barre Syndrome was diagnosed. On 25-APR-2021, hospital physician ruled out other causes and confirmed that Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) was caused by Janssen COVID vaccine. At the time of report, the patient was intubated at the hospital. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient had not recovered from Guillain-Barre Syndrome.

                                                The evening of the shot I woke up with pain in my legs near my hips which lasted for a day. On 04/12/2021 my left leg was swollen and painful. I was already taking blood thinner. I went to the Emergency Room the next day and they found a blood clot in my leg. The Thrombosis was behind my left knee. My leg was swollen from the knee down and my ankle was very swollen. My Eliquis dosage has been increased from 2.5mg to 5mg twice daily. I did not have a repeat sonogram but my leg is no longer swollen.

                                                3 days after the vaccine, I felt pain in the left leg; I thought I had torn my angle/foot (I have not kicked anything nor made a wrong step, but there was a bit of pain: since I hike a lot in the City and the country, I could have slightly sprayed my ankle without really recalling it), but I have never had such swelling: I could put my finger in the foot from the ankle down and it would leave a 1/3rd of an inch depression in a puffed-up skin/subcutis.  I am a pathologist myself and found it unnecessary to bother anyone with the trouble. So I took aspirin which controlled the swelling somewhat. It took a good 4 weeks for the swelling to fully subside, with a few occasional episodes of worsening. It is all good now.

                                                Immediately after injection significant arm pain that resolved quickly. Approximately 36 hours after injection dizziness. 48 hours after injection neck and head pain on left side, arm soreness, and swollen lymph node on left side of throat. Minor pain in mouth and throat with fatigue and dizziness. Neck and head pain decreasing on day 3 with all other effects resolving but injection site is still fairly sore. Overall, I would say this was probably a normal response associated with my immune system reacting to the injection. I had the virus the first week of December 2020. I would classify my infection as moderate. I was sick with fever, chills and severe body aches and it lasted for 10-14 days.
