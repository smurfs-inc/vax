                                                Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I received the Janssen vaccine in my upper-left arm at 3:00 PM on April 5, 2021, at a public health clinic (I think that&#39;s the proper term for the site) established in a mall. After about ten minutes, during the scheduled waiting period, I began to feel lightheaded; I can best compare the feeling to that of being tipsy after a glass or two of wine. I waited another twenty minutes at the site to see if the feeling worsened, and when it didn&#39;t, I left without telling anyone how I felt. During the drive home, however, I continued to feel lightheaded during the drive home and worried that it might be affecting my driving. After I got home without incident, the feeling persisted for a few hours and ceased that evening.  Since then, I have experienced nothing but what I think are standard post-vaccination symptoms (fatigue, muscle aches, slight brain fog, swollen lymph nodes?not unlike the sensations of recovering from a modest cold). I nevertheless want to report the lightheadedness because it appears (based on news reports) that it is an unusual reaction to the vaccine. I want to make sure that my experience is recorded, even though I do not believe that I require further medical attention.

                                                Since my shot I have not been able to feel muscles all over my body. There is little to know sensation unless I press as hard as I can. Lymphnodes have been in pain and swollen since the first or second day after the shot. Headaches on and off for a month now. And my anxiety has been like I&#39;m in fight or flight mode all of my waking moments. Even when I&#39;m falling asleep. I will wake up with panic attacks. My muscles can&#39;t take talking on the phone for longer than 5 minutes before I have to switch to my other arm because the previous arm is &#34;dead&#34; in the muscles and couldn&#39;t do it any longer. Blood pressure was in the 180-190&#39;s / the high 80&#39;s and sometimes even 90 being my bottom BP number. It has since gone down because of meditation.

                                                One week after receiving the vaccine I woke up on 5/21 with a mild rash. As the day went on the rash progressed and swelling of lips and uvula occurred around 5pm. I was taken to an urgent care who transferred me to a hospital via rescue. I spent the night at the hospital receiving multiple epi pen injections, and fluids. I was discharged 5/22 with a dose of prednisone. I was fatigued all day. On 5/23 I woke up to swollen eyes and lips and covered in hives again. I went to the ER where I was given steroids and fluids again. The hives went down but did not go away.  One 5/24 I took multiple doses of Benadryl and dose of prednisone and in the evening time the hives progressed. Today 5/25 I woke up with swollen lips and checks and hives. I went to my doctors office to be evaluated.

                                                I received the vaccine on Wednesday, April 7th.  I was told I had an anaphylactic reaction at the time of injection: I started sweating upon receiving the vaccine, my blood pressure dropped, and I almost passed out. I was monitored for 30 mins before being sent home. Other than some fatigue, I was fine the rest of the day.  On Thursday, April 8th, I was tired but felt fine otherwise.  Friday and Saturday, April 9th and 10th, I felt like I was back to normal and even did some light exercise.  On Sunday morning, April 10th, the left side of my body (side of injection) went numb, I had extreme vertigo, shortness of breath, and blotches that appeared in random places. It didn&#39;t look like hives, but rather looked like strips of red. I didn&#39;t feel like I was having an allergic reaction, but something did not feel right. I consider myself a pretty healthy guy with a healthy lifestyle. I did not feel the need to go to the ER quite yet, but I did have a friend come over to monitor me.  My friend did some acupuncture which helped resolve the numbness and dizziness and some of the blotches, and also mentioned concerns regarding blood circulation and potential clotting issues she thought I was having.

                                                Covid-19 vaccine JJ: 32 y.o. male w/ no PMH presenting 2 weeks after receiving his Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID vaccine after having severe L calf pain found to have thrombocytopenia.    From H&amp;P on 4/21, Patient reports that he had both fevers and aches after his vaccine (4/8/2021). Several days later developed low back pain radiating into his left leg which he initially attributed to sciatica. However, several days later, he went for a 6 mile hike, and felt that his left leg was hurting more. He went to PCP, where he received a blood test and was found to have a platelet count in the low 60s. This was initially thought to be a lab error, but he noticed that his left leg was swollen, somewhat red, and appeared that his blood vessels were swollen. This swelling resolves when he is lying down, and is worsened when he is standing. He received an US to r/o DVT, which was negative. However, after his repeat platelet count demonstrated thrombocytopenia, he was sent to the ED. He denies any recent leg trauma, though he has broken his leg before nearly 15 years ago.  He denies weakness or issues going to the bathroom. Denies chest pain or shortness of breath. Denies chills, fevers, but did wake up last 2 nights drenched in sweat. He also reports a petechial rash on his legs.   As of 4/22, medical team suspects Vaccine-induced thrombocytopenic purpura (VITT). VITT requires 1) thrombocytopenia, 2) documented clot, 3) positive PF4 Ab, and 4) recent AstraZeneca or J&amp;J vaccine. He meets criteria 1, 3, and 4. He has clinical signs of DVT but does not have a documented clot. Patient has L calf tenderness and prominent pooling of blood and vein engorgement of the L leg when he stands up. Possible that he had a DVT or multiple that cleared and now he has post-thrombotic syndrome. This is consistent with the pooling of blood with gravity and relief of symptoms with elevation. As he has had 2 negative US for DVT, unlikely that he has an unresolved DVT. abdominal and head CT are neg for thrombosis.

I do not suffer from asthma prior to this vaccine. I experienced headaches, fatigue, congestion, my ears were plugged and I also developed a rash on my arms and I also noticed a lymph node in my neck that I did not have prior to the vaccine. When I went to see my doctor my symptoms were not as prominent and the lymph node in my neck is decreasing in size.

Early evening a rash developed in the left thigh and left foot swollen size of balloon and bright red. Went to the ER 10:30PM, admitted from ER on 4/16/21 for possible deep vein thrombosis and cellulitis of left leg. Shortly after admission, unable to obtain venous  access, central line inserted for IV fluids and IV vancomycin and Zosyn. Foot swelling increased up to below knee with bright red skin color. No open wound noted on extremity. Ultrasound did not find a thrombosis but enlarged lymph nodes. 6 days later leg still swollen and red, repeat doppler ultrasound negative, but report stated could not compress to complete test due to severe swelling.  He was also tachycardic and hypertensive during admission. Infectious disease doctor consulted and confirmed severe cellulitis but it was written in discharge summary the covid vaccine can not be ruled out as a cause of the infection and admission. Lasix was initiated to decrease swelling in lower extremity. He was on SQ heparin 3 times a day during the admission. He was discharged on Doxycycline and Augmentin.  After discharge saw primary care physician who palpated large lymph nodes in neck. Mild headache persists. Ultrasound of neck to be completed on 4/27/21. Started on Tizanidine for pain.

Still feeling some of it, mainly a slight headache, some loss of balance and I still get hot and start sweating at random times for no obvious reason.

                                                Patient went to the hospital Monday.  He received the Janssen single-dose Covid vaccine on Thursday, April 8 and by Saturday, April 10 he was starting to develop fairly significant peripheral edema without any breathing  difficulties.  This  persisted and was worse by Monday, April 13  EKG showed global nonspecific T-wave abnormalities and ST segment changes so I had him sent to the ER. As it turned out he had a pancytopenia (mostly neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) so he was admitted to the hospital. This seemed to resolve pretty much on its own and so they attributed everything to his hepatitis C. Indeed his LFTs are elevated in the 300 range and imaging showed  hepatosplenomegaly.  they also did a bone marrow biopsy for which there are no results yet

                                                36 Y male patient from another country with a past medical history significant for mild HTN (on 2.5 mg amlodipine) who was in his usual state of health until approximately 4/17/21 when he developed acute onset left volar forearm tingling sensation. He had received the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine on 4/2/21 in his left arm and states that he did not experience any noticeable reactions after vaccination. He also recalls having had sustained a minor superficial scrape on his left volar forearm by a trash can lid when he had taken out garbage, which occurred very shortly before the onset of this tingling sensation. The tingling sensation then progressively worsened and became more diffuse across most of his body. He then developed fevers up to 102 at home, chills, neck pain, headache, and pain in all extremities (primarily arms but also in his legs).   He initially went to the Health Care ED on 4/28/21. He was afebrile at the time and his vital signs at that time were unremarkable with the exception of elevated diastolic blood pressures (90-104 mm Hg). WBC 10.1 with normal differential, electrolytes and liver enzymes within normal limits. Influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 PCR were negative. Urinalysis showed few bacteria but no WBCs. Chest x-ray was clear. Blood cultures were drawn and patient was then discharged.   Patient returned to the ED on 4/29/21 and reported fever to 102-103 d F, chills, nausea, weakness, body aches, and bilateral foot paraesthesias. He was afebrile (98.8) and his vital signs were within normal limits. His WBC was slightly elevated to 12.2 with a normal differential. His ESR was 11, CRP 1.5, CMP within normal limits. He was noted to have urinary retention and a foley was placed and he was given tamsulosin.    Patient then returned to the ED again the following day, on 4/30/21, with worsening generalized pain and weakness and difficulty walking.   ED course: temperature 101, heart rate 100s-110s, BP 140s-160s/70s-90s, RR low 20s, SaO2 high 90s. Labs remarkable for WBC 13.1 with 82.4% N, ESR 7, CRP 5.9, lactic acid 2.6, RF 10, urinalysis unremarkable, HIV antigen/antibody negative. Several imaging studies were performed. MRI T spine showed &#34;Extensive cord signal abnormality in the cervical and thoracic cord as detailed above, with associated expansion of the cord (most pronounced in the cervical cord). Differential includes acute transverse myelitis, demyelination, infection (HIV, syphilis, other viruses)/parainfectious phenomenon, subacute combined degeneration, and inflammatory etiologies. An underlying mass or masses are not excluded but less likely given extensive multifocal patchy involvement. Recommend postcontrast imaging at this time for further workup. Consider brain MR as well to assess for systemic white matter disease.&#34;   A lumbar puncture was attempted in the ED but was unable to be performed.   Patient was given empiric IV ceftriaxone 1 g q24h and admitted to the hospitalist service. He was evaluated by neurology and was started on Solumedrol 1000 mg for acute transverse myelitis.   5/1/21 MRI brain showed &#34;Multifocal patchy white matter signal changes, predominantly in the subcortical white matter, also present in the bilateral thalami and bilateral middle cerebellar peduncle, and redemonstration of extensive cervical cord signal abnormality and expansion. No associated restricted diffusion or enhancement. Broad differential, but given pattern of involvement findings are most concerning for ADEM (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis), other considerations include other demyelinating processes, toxic-metabolic pathology, or potentially atypical viral infection.&#34; Patient was given methylprednisolone for ADEM with transverse myelitis and clinically improved. He was hospitalized from 4/30/21 until being discharged to home in a wheelchair on 5/6/21.

Fingers feel sticky like they have glue on them.

                                                He is a 37-year-old active male with no significant medical history. One week ago, on Friday, March 26, he received the Johnson and Johnson vaccine for Covid 19. That day he felt fine. The following day he had some muscle aches. Sunday he states he had some slight shortness of breath, only for that day. Then he had some fever and chills feeling. That resolved. The only symptoms that persisted was his muscle aching and tightness. Then yesterday, the day of his presentation to the ER, he noted some bilateral lower extremity edema which prompted his visit. He is feeling mostly fine except a bit of muscle tightness. BNP was 154. Chest x-ray showed pneumonitis. He received antibiotics. Echocardiogram was completed showing preliminary findings of small to moderate pericardial effusion and trace aortic insufficiency.  Will treat with colchicine and ibuprofen.

At time of admission pt had been taking antibiotics for an upper respiratory infection for 3 days. Echo Lv 40-45% upon admission. Pt was determined to have myopericarditis. On 3/24/21 pt was transferred to the cardiac intermediate unit. Endocrine consulted while in the cardiac intermediate unit to control his elevated blood sugars- endocrine team unable to determine if blood sugar is type 1 or type 2. on 3/27/21 pt went into respiratory distress required bipap &amp; high flow nasal cannula and had a fever. Pulmonary consulted at this time- determined to be related to pulmonary edema and not a PE positive for pleural effusion. ID has been negative up to this point. 4/9/21 pt transferred to internal medicine service for work up for fever of unknown origin and continued management. Rheumatology consulted for leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated IgG. Ruled out connective tissue disease, stills disease, and vasculitis. Histoplasma was borderline positive pt has had recent bat exposure. Bone marrow biopsy done on 4/13/2021, ruled out HLH. Bronch done 4/15 to assess for TB, histoplasma, negative results so far. As of 4/15 no recommendations from ID and patient continues to look weaker/fatigued and spikes fever.

However the next day my upper lip and lower nose swole up in an allergic reaction.  I took Benadryl and went to sleep and by the time I work up it had subsided.  Two days after that incident I woke up (this morning) and my left cheek was swollen from another allergic reaction.  During this time I had not eaten or taken anything out of the ordinary.

                                                About 9 hours after receiving the vaccine I began developing flu-like symptoms, which quickly escalated. Within a couple of hours I developed a very high fever (which peaked at 104.1 and hovered around 102-103), body-wracking cold chills, extreme lethargy and body aches. The only thing that kept my fever down was 1,000mg of Tylenol every 6 hours, with a cold compress on my head. The symptoms were less severe but still substantial by the following day. On the second night after receiving the vaccine (Monday the 8th) I had nightsweats, but then woke up on the morning of Tuesday the 9th feeling almost completely back to normal. The only other strange thing to happen was waking up today on Thursday the 11th with a giant fever blister on my lip, which I suppose could be attributed to an immune system in temporary disarray or overdrive. I am still very grateful for the vaccine and would do it again, but it was very scary that first night on Sunday the 7th. I don&#39;t remember the last time I felt that sick.

Went to ER for evaluation, CT scan with contrast. CT confirmed lump was swelling of lymphoid. ER thought maybe shingles, but it crosses over slightly over to the right with lesions.They determined maybe a virus and follow up with a dermatologist.  4/4/21 lesions now on left eye lid. ER visit again to ensure eye is ok, the ER dr. believes its shingles. 4/5/21 visit to dermatology and swab of lesions on face taken (still waiting on results). Dermatology believes some kind of herpes, but not sure. Went to Eye specialist to ensure eye does not have virus on same day. Eye dr believes shingles. Virus is not in the eye, but on left eyelid.

                                                4/1 pt complained of not feeling well after Janssen vaccine. Patient had a syncopal episode while at monitoring tent, patient was trying to lay down on medical bay cot but ended up falling back and passing out. Pt was clammy and pale. Heart rate 42, spO2 99%. Pt oriented to self but not time or place. EMT arrive to further evaluate patient, BP 90/60. heart-rate 55, respirations 18. Patient refused to go to hospital, felt well enough to go back to work. Charge nurse followed up with patient later that day, patient was still at work and said he felt a lot better.   One week later pt reached out on 4/8/2021 to inform on potential side effects. On the night of 4/7/2021 he began to develop hives/rash, and itchiness around the neck and legs. Next morning 4/8/2021 rash had worsened and pt had also developed swelling in the face and wrists. Pt was brought to urgent care where he was treated with prednisone. Pt was prescribed 20mg prednisone tablet twice a day. Charge nurse from day of vaccine followed up with patient, he will continue to take prednisone as prescribed and will follow up with allergist. Pt claims the itchiness is less, as well as, the swelling. Appreciates the follow-up phone-call and claims to feel better, will update us if any changes.

                                                I developed a very itchy rash on my back, hands, feet, arms and what felt like everywhere.  The just today stopped.  The rash lasted about 8-10 days I would say.  It got worse over the course of a week and then started getting better.   Someone suggested I take an anti-inflammatory, because my hands were swelling and it was difficult to work at the computer.  That seemed to help immediately or it could&#39;ve just started to go away on its own.  Regardless, I&#39;ve kept the twice daily naproxen for the past 4 days and things seem to be all better now.   My wife suggested I report my reaction.    The small red bumps were scattered mostly on my back, feet and hands.  They looked very similar to shingles but without the big red splotches only the small red bumps.  As they were forming they appeared to be sun blisters and then turned bright red.  Extremely itchy and kept me up scratching at night and scratching all day.
