                                                COVID infection post vaccination  1 day following vaccination, patient experienced fatigue, myalgia and low grade fever.  RA test positive.  That evening, patient with increasing SOB and increasing oxygen requirement and was admitted for hypoxia &#43; LE swelling.  Although SNF where vaccination took place denied symptoms at time of vaccination, per H&amp;P, increasing oxygen requirements were noted 3 days prior to vaccination.   See H&amp;P below  He is currently residing in a rehab facility following a hospitalization detailed below, but essentially he noted some shortness of breath about 4-5 days ago. They checked his oxygen saturation and noted that he was hypoxic, so started him on oxygen (reportedly 4L NC?). He reports a worsened productive cough; sputum is dark but not bloody in color. He has been fatigued and chilled; he thinks he&#39;s been intermittently febrile. No nausea, vomiting, or constipation. He endorses twice daily diarrhea, but he associates this with his bowel regimen. He also has a fair amount of lower extremity swelling which is bothersome to him; he says this has been ongoing since his MVA in January.[KE.4] He was recently seen in Nephrology clinic, where he was started on lasix 40mg daily and started on a low sodium diet[KE.3]. He is unsure if the lasix is helping his swelling, but does have robust urine output after he takes it

                                                I had a residual cough when I had the vaccine. Up to a week after vaccine, I had low grade fever and chills; night sweating and coughing seemed to be getting worse and coughing getting more frequent and worse (when it had been dry and occasional). It was ongoing for a week. I called my Doctor during that time and she prescribed me medications including an antibiotic and cold medications for the cough. The medications helped symptoms after I&#39;d been on them awhile . I no longer have the fever and I stopped the night sweating. Cough seems to be improved.

Patient reported to emergency department around 10 pm that day (4/9)- says tongue began swelling since 7pm, he took a benadryl at 8pm with no improvement. Per ED physician, patient had &#34;tremendous amount of tongue swelling, I am not even able to visualize the palate he has fullness to his left neck as well&#34;. Patient intubated in emergency room to protect airway.  Patient admitted to ICU where he is still today (4/13). Per chart, the edema subsided on 4/12 and patient was extubated today (4/13). Patient received IV steroids from 4/9- 4/13 (discontinued this morning).  Of note: patient does take lisinopril 20mg daily (start date July 2020). There is concern the angioedema was caused by this medication. Patient received tranexamic acid and Berinert in the emergency department to assist in treating this potential etiology.

                                                The Jansen vaccine was given on 3/18/21. Patient began to experience symptoms of bells palsy on 4/6/21. Patient noted  R hemibody numbness, which began with right-sided facial numbness when brushing teeth. He was evaluated by his PCP (no exam noted) and initiated on Bells Palsy regimen of doxycycline 100mg BID, acyclovir 800mg TID, and prednisone 40mg. On 4/9, a referral to neurology was made after pt returned to clinic w/ burning deep low back pain that radiates up to his shoulder, and his b/l temples. Pt again re-presented to urgent care on 4/12 due to severe burning back pain that resolved w/ activity. At this time again only L sided facial weakness noted (documented as reduced ability to close eyelid, raise eyebrow, weakness puffing out check, and reduced smile on L), no other weakness, drift, or sensory findings. Pt was instructed to continue doxycylilne 100mg BID 10d course (4/6- 4/15), prednisone 40mg 7d course (4/6- 4/12), acyclovir 800mg TID 7d course(4/6-4/12).

                                                After my vaccine, I experienced redness sensation to my arm. My left arm was swollen and raised bump with a rash. I called my doctor and he thought it was possible cellulitis. He prescribed Prednisone and an antibiotic for seven days. After the seven days my rash was gone but I still had the raised bump. I went to an urgent care facility where they performed an ultrasound of left upper extremity and no blood clot was found. I was told to apply warm compresses to my left arm once a day. To this day I still have an aching sensation to my left arm and is also sore and my left arm is still red but flat in shape.

                                                I received the Janssen vaccine on March 13.  By the next weekend, I had what I thought was a spider bite on the inside of my left thigh.  That &#34;bite&#34; got worse--bigger, hot to the touch, and then red.  On the weekend of the 27-28 of March, it was red, raised and very painful even when not touched.     I called my family doctor on Monday morning, the 29th of March, and I was sent to the Emergency Room, where I was diagnosed with a 7cm thrombosis in my left greater saphenous vein, which is treated the same as a DVT.    I was treated first with Lovenox injections, then Eliquis 10 mg 2x daily, now 5 mg 2x daily.    The blood clot is still painful to the touch.

Patient began having some blood in his sputum since this morning at 4AM, and that occurred twice more with intervals of a few hours, both continuously improving and less blood. No other symptoms. No history of TB, no exposure to sick contacts, no recent travel. Unlikely a pulmonary embolus given normal vital signs and no risk factors. Patient was doing outdoor work in his yard for the past few days before the symptom onset and was working on mulch and compost.

The patient&#39;s height, and weight were not reported. The patient&#39;s concurrent conditions included blood pressure.  The patient received covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s (suspension for injection, route of admin not reported, batch number: 1805020, expiry: unknown) dose was not reported, 1 total administered on 08-APR-2021 between 09.30 and 09.40 to left arm for prophylactic vaccination. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) for blood pressure. On 08-APR-2021, 20 minutes after vaccination, the patient started having symptoms. The patient&#39;s heart started aching and that lasted for 15-20 minutes and then went away. On 09-APR-2021, the patient had chills that had lasted for four hours. On 10-APR-2021, the patient could not move his neck left or right and back of his head felt like it was swelling and  tender; he also had a headache, and he was extremely sleepy. The patient&#39;s neck and head tenderness lasted three to four days. On 11-APR-2021, the patient eyes had blood shot and were red and reported that he might had a stroke or blood clot. On 17-APR-2021, he had a knot came up in the center of right arch on foot. On 19-APR-2021, at the time of this report, the patient&#39;s eyes were still red and had a slight headache; the patient&#39;s neck still hurts, he was sleepy, and the knot was still there on his right arch of his foot. The patient took acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) but he was already taking that for his blood pressure. The action taken with covid-19 vaccine ad26.cov2.s was not applicable. The patient recovered from heart ache on 08-APR-2021, head swelling and tender on 14-APR-2021, and chills on 09-APR-2021, and had not recovered from neck hurts/could not move neck, bloodshot in eye/eyes were red, headache, sleepy, and knot in center of right arch of foot. This report was serious (Other Medically Important Condition).; Sender&#39;s Comments: V0:  This 64-year-old African American (non-Hispanic/Latino) hypertensive male patient reported &#34;heart aching&#34; 20 minutes after receiving COVID-19 VACCINE AD26.COV2.S for the prevention of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. The event lasted for 15-20 minutes.  Other associated symptoms developed in the succeeding 3 days: chills that lasted for hours, could not move his neck and felt it was swelling and tender, headache, sleepiness, blood shot eyes.  Nine days after vaccination, the patient reported he had a knot in the center of arch right foot.  The patient took Aspirin.  No other details was reported.  The event is confounded by the underlying hypertension.  The information available precludes a complete and meaningful assessment.  However, considering the temporal relationship and recently evolving theories in the literature about COVID infections and vaccinations, potential vaccine contribution cannot be excluded.  Additional information was requested.

                                                4/25/2021 - He was apparently well until 2 days prior to admission when he developed spontaneous left calf pain and swelling.  He denies any associated trauma, recent travel and immobility.  He is not taking any new prescription, including steroids. One day prior to admission, he started experiencing left-sided pleuritic chest pain up to 9/10 in intensity and exertional shortness of breath.  He denies any fevers, hemoptysis, sputum production, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness or lightheadedness.  The pain was persistent throughout the day.  Today, his chest pain persisted and his shortness of breath had progressed.  He also noted left arm swelling with mild discomfort.  He felt that his left leg swelling and pain had improved today.  Nevertheless, given persistent symptoms, he decided to come to the emergency room for further evaluation management.   In the emergency room, his initial blood pressure was 218/104 with mild tachycardia of 99, normal oxygen saturation and no fevers.  CBC showed a white count of 12.35, hematocrit of 50.4 and normal platelet count 198.  INR was normal at 1.06.  BMP showed mild hyperglycemia at 148.  Troponin was 5 and BNP was 8.  Imaging studies show extensive left upper extremity DVTs that involved the left subclavian vein, left lower extremity DVTs and bilateral lower lobe pulmonary emboli.   4/30/2021 Presumed unprovoked extensive DVT of the left upper extremity and left lower extremity.  However, he did recently receive Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine.  Now status post catheter directed thrombolysis to the left upper extremity.

Then I started to get a severe headache that was pretty constant. After multiple days, my face became paralyzed. I also experienced severe fatigue. This was over 10 days. Once paralysis happened we went to the Medical Center. I was treated with IVIG for many days and oral steroids. I was in the hospital for 6 days. I also experienced my BP spiking. I had an abnormal EKG. I&#39;m still unable to chew properly. I was told that now I have Encephalitis and GBS (Gillian Barres syndrome).

The discoloration began to spread and I went to the doctor on the 21st. The doctor said there was inflammation and because it was warm to the touch, was concerned about blood clots. I was sent for an ultrasound and prescribed an anti-inflammatory medication and advised to take aspirin. Everything cleared up about a week later.

                                                The second week after I got the vaccine I started to have a pressure headache on the side of my head and down my neck. My leg was painful by my knee and it lasted a week. I had the headache and the pain at the back of my neck for one week. The pain medication did not help with the pain. The headache was on both sides but much worse on the right.  I had a bump on the back of my neck on the right that was painful. I had a rash on my arm around the site of the injection about an inch around which is still visible after three weeks. The rash was a little itchy.

                                                Had a heart transplant 5 years ago. After vaccination, my calf muscles ached and I had to walk on the balls of my feet. I didn?t feel well and was achy, but all of that resolved after about 4 or 5 days. About 25 days after the vaccine, I woke up and my legs were hurting, swollen and lumpy. I went into the house and elevated my feet. I was sore from my calf to my ankles. I called the doctor and he told me to go the ER. After a 3 hour wait, one of the patients waiting almost threw up me, so I told them I was going home. Later, I went in to see the doctor about what was going on. After rubbing my calf vigorously, some of the lumps started to go away. The only thing my doctors came up with was that I was retaining water. I felt like I had gained some weight. I couldn?t stand long before my legs swelled. They prescribed a strong diuretic called Torsemide and I lost about 10 lbs. I currently wear compression socks every day, which helps with the swelling and my ankles hurt all of the time. I only take the meds as needed because it?s hard on my kidneys, which are already compromised due to my transplant meds.

Over the next two days the left stayed the same while the right continued to worsen to include pain and tingling from the elbow to the hand particularly in the three central fingers. Hand difficulty holding item in my right hand. I then decided to seek medical attention the next day. The next morning swelling and pain were lessened so I did not contact medical attention.  Each day since symptoms have improved except for discomfort in my right middle finger which is noticeable upon touch. Most noticeable when using eating utensils. The right middle finger has remained the same for days.

By March 8th the swelling and pain in my left leg was so bad I made an appointment with Dr. for March 11th. He ordered another sonogram and found 2 DVTs in my left leg, and prescribed anti-coagulants whyich I am still on. At the time the Doctor said that this was most likly a result of having stood in line for 2&amp;1/2 hours.

                                                Patient presented to the ED on 6/7/21 with abdominal pain that had started earlier that day. CT abdomen, CXR, and urinalysis were done and all came back negative. Patient denied any respiratory symptoms. On physical exam, he was found to have severe swelling, erythema,  and ecchymosis on his left leg extending into the upper thigh and knee. A lower extremity doppler was done and found extensive occlusive thrombosis within the left lower extremity beginning in the external iliac vein and extending into the common femoral, femoral, profunda, popliteal and visualized deep calf veins.  No evidence of PE or DVT in the RLE was found. Vascular Surgery was consulted, who did not recommend any procedures, but patient was started on a heparin drip. Hematology later saw the patient and changed the heparin drip to rivaroxaban on 6/9/21. Infectious Diseases was also consulted for possible sepsis.

I can&#39;t grasp or pinch things. I must use both hands to hold a glass or cup. Very weak, sleeping 16-18 hours a day. At times I get very chilled and start to shiver. Never have had a fever, loss of taste, or smell.  I tested NEG for the virus on day 3 (10 days after receiving the vaccine). Soreness is turned into pain. Feels like full-blown RA and if I was black I would be thinking sickle-cell because of the general pain.

Pt also stated he wasn&#39;t having any trouble breaking, skin tone look normal, pt was able to communicate with no problems. He stated the symptoms he was experiencing were something he was used to. It happens to him when he eats chicken  and certain kinds of foods (especially seafood/shellfish). I offered him benadryl and an ice pack while he was here. He refused the ice pack, but did  agree to low dose of benadryl. He took one Allergy Relief 25mg softgel and then continued to set for a little over 30 minutes total before he said he was fine and left with his wife.  I contacted him around 11:50am, he was doing fine and enjoying a good lunch.

                                                Approximately two weeks after vaccination I noticed his left foot and leg swelling. Patient advised me that he needed to go to the hospital because he was not feeling well and his oxygen level was low.   We called 911 and was taken to the hospital.  After at the hospital I advised a male nurse  that I was concerned about his leg being swollen cause he had been given the Jansen Covid vaccine and I was concerned about blood clots.   Everyday I would tell someone in the hospital (never saw a doctor I could talk to) about his swollen leg but did not really get anyone interested. Before he was moved to a Veteran?s State Home, I overheard someone saying they were going to give him his anticoagulant.  I?m filing this  report in case the swollen leg was a result of blood clots due to the vaccine.

                                                Deep Vein Thrombosis right leg.  Five days after being vaccinated I began to notice swelling in my right leg from my knee through my ankle-foot area.  There was an associated increase in pain in the knee.  I tried to shake it off hoping that the swelling and pain would go away, but I finally relented to the concerns of my family and sought care on the 6th of April at the emergency room because my doctor refused an in-person appointment.  The emergency room physician prescribed Eliquis which I have been taking.  The swelling seems to have leveled off, but my right leg still appears to be twice the size of my left leg
